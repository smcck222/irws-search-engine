FT  13 MAR 93 / Still asleep after the wake-up call: One year after the LA
riots, there is anger at the government's inadequate response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A year ago, South Central Los Angeles burst into arson, looting and killing
after the surprise acquittal last April of four white police officers
accused of brutally beating Mr Rodney King, a black motorist.
Last week, in a federal courtroom a few miles away in downtown Los Angeles,
Mr King took the witness stand in a second trial of the same officers on
slightly different charges.
It is scarcely surprising that city officials are nervous about the outcome
of the case, and of the imminent trial of the four black men who attacked Mr
Reginald Denny, a white lorry driver who found himself in the middle of the
riots last year.
But some in Los Angeles's diverse and divided communities almost wonder if
they need another riot, so inadequate has been the response from government,
at any level, to six days of mayhem that left 42 people dead and 700
businesses burnt to the ground.
'The Los Angeles riots were supposed to be a wake-up call. I am beginning to
be afraid that people have put it on snooze control,' says Ms Dolly Gee, a
labour lawyer active in the Asian-American community.
Much of the attention in the days after the riots subsided focused on a
private sector initiative, Rebuild LA, set up by Mayor Tom Bradley under the
leadership of Mr Peter Ueberroth, who organised the 1984 Los Angeles
Olympics and whose reputed Midas touch raised high expectations.
Rebuild LA's leaders acknowledge that visible results have come slower than
many in the community would have liked.
'We call ourselves Rebuild LA and people say: how come you haven't rebuilt
the place on the corner,' says Mr Barry Sanders, a senior partner with the
Los Angeles law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins and one of Rebuild LA's
co-chairmen.
Rebuild LA has cajoled well over Dollars 300m of investments out of
companies in the Los Angeles area and beyond; Shell, for example, succumbed
to its persuasion to rebuild its burnt petrol stations.
But Rebuild LA itself merely emphasises to many the abdication of
responsibility by government.
'Most of the strategy and a great deal of the commitment is coming from the
private sector, which is marvellous, but it has to be matched by serious
legislative reform,' says Dr Kathleen Connell, an academic and investment
banker who chairs Rebuild LA's business investment task force. Community
activists have for years criticised the federal government for its failure
to come to the aid of the struggling inner cities. But what is most striking
today is the extent to which their anger is now shared by businessmen, who
never before came closer to South Central than a concert at the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
'It is most disheartening. Everybody says this was the worst riot in the
history of American and what has the government done about it? The city has
done nothing, the state has done nothing and the federal government has done
nothing,' complained a senior executive at one big Los Angeles company.
The riots came at the worst possible time for government to respond. Even in
the years of rapid economic growth in the 1980s, the inner city stagnated.
With the recession, deeper and longer in California than any other state in
the US, incomes have declined and unemployment has risen. As a result, more
than 18 per cent of the citizens of Los Angeles now live in poverty.
But the recession also dried up tax revenues, forcing cuts in public
expenditure. Governor Pete Wilson proposes to cut state spending by 11 per
cent this year, with education, health and welfare services hardest hit.
'Just the time you need government to respond coincides with the time they
don't have the resources,' says Mr Sanders.
But 'we would if we could' no longer cuts much ice with the many Angelenos
who see an abject failure of political will at all levels of government:
Washington playing election year games with an urban aid bill that never
passed into law, Sacramento paying its bills with IOUs in a two-month budget
deadlock, and Los Angeles plunged into a political vacuum with the
retirement of Mayor Bradley after 20 years in office.
Beneath their anger and frustration many Angelenos still believe their city
has, despite all, a bright and prosperous future. Some of the most
optimistic are the new immigrants who continue to flock to the city from
Asia and Latin America. The nagging doubt remains, however: is this
sprawling metropolis, its 9m inhabitants divided by language, culture and
income, now too big to be governable?
Moves to break up the Los Angeles School District are already gaining
ground, and a few brave souls have even suggested dissolving the city
itself.
Los Angeles's borders defy logic. From its centre 15 miles inland, the city
has thrown out tentacles, reaching south along a narrow, 20-mile corridor to
its harbour and encircling the independent cities of Beverly Hills and Santa
Monica to the west. In 1918 it swallowed whole the San Fernando valley to
the north, as a by-product of a grandiose scheme to divert the waters of the
Owens River, 250 miles away on the other side of the Sierra Nevada.
Los Angeles's city charter, too, is a historical relic: a well-intentioned
reform from the 1920s which has led to administrative chaos.
'The central weakness of the charter, of which we are daily reminded, is
that its extreme vigilance in protecting citizens from potential abuses of
power makes the exercise of effective power impossible,' says Ms Xandra
Kayden, a prominent advocate of charter reform.
The city council has only 15 members, each of whom holds de facto veto power
over affairs in his or her own district. This leaves the mayor as the only
elected official with a city-wide perspective. But the mayor's power is
diluted and shared with 51 semi-independent commissions, running everything
from the animal shelters to the airport.
'I would rather give birth to a porcupine backwards than become the mayor of
Los Angeles,' said Mr William Mulholland, the engineer who, as head of Los
Angeles's water department from 1886 to 1928, laid the foundations for the
city's development.
This did not deter 52 people from announcing their candidacy to succeed Mr
Bradley, although only 31 of them have qualified for the April 20 ballot.
Most proposals for reforming the city's government would concentrate more
power in the hands of the mayor, enlarging the council, weakening the
commissions and giving him the power to sack department heads.
A strong new mayor, even without such reforms, could exert personal
leadership, as many argue Mayor Bradley did, at the beginning of his two
decades in office. But for the moment, that leadership is not evident.
Some community activists, however, see a silver lining to the government's
inactivity. In particular, it has spurred residents to take matters into
their own hands in a somewhat perverse form of the 'empowerment' beloved by
politicians from right and left. One encouraging sign was the truce declared
by leaders of the Crips and the Bloods, two of Los Angeles's most notorious
gangs, who also demanded more funding for schools, better street lighting
and sanitation, and a thorough overhaul of welfare programmes. 'After the
riots, people now have less tolerance for neglect,' says one Los Angeles
council aide, noting a surge in demands for proper street cleaning.
Will that agitation get the streets cleaned and lit? The answer may help
determine whether Los Angeles will succumb to its welter of economic, racial
and social problems, or develop into the vibrant metropolis that many of its
inhabitants believe it can still be.

Sir, My sincere thanks to Malcolm Rutherford, who has restored my faith in
drama critics. He alone was not caught by the hype surrounding the opening
of Crazy for You, and gave the only honest review I have read of this
lamentable show which, for some strange reason, seems to be receiving
considerable backing from Radio 2. Is this really the purpose of Britain's

FT  13 MAR 93 / Governor throws down the gauntlet: Patten's decision to
proceed with democracy legislation has shocked China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the Chinese leadership sequestered in Zhongnanhai, Beijing's Kremlin,
the decision by Governor Chris Patten of Hong Kong to proceed with
publication of his democracy legislation must have been profoundly
perplexing.
Previous governors, who were senior Foreign Office officials, and their
masters in Whitehall had always taken care to clear in advance any changes
in Hong Kong's political arrangements. Beijing, as Mr Qian Qichen, China's
foreign minister, confided recently to a group of sympathetic Hong Kong
politicians, has always known that if it stands firm Britain will back down.
When Britain did show signs of independence, it had to be punished, Mr Qian
said.
Beijing's leadership was already seriously angered by what it saw as Mr
Patten's insubordinate behaviour last October when he announced the outline
of his proposals for Hong Kong's 1995 elections - the last to be held before
the Chinese takeover in 1997. They disliked both his ingenious exploitation
of loopholes in their own Basic Law for Hong Kong to introduce a much
broader franchise than they had envisaged, and the fact that they were not
first consulted.
Their 'punishment' of Mr Patten was played out in November and December when
China threatened the validity of contracts which span the 1997 transfer of
sovereignty. Beijing also attacked Jardine Matheson, the trading house, and
tried to scare Hong Kong's civil servants by raising questions about their
future pension entitlements. This produced a sharp fall in the stock market
and business antagonism towards Mr Patten, but not a British back-down.
Earlier this year China changed tack, perhaps thinking that where
sabre-rattling had failed diplomacy would succeed. Informed by Mr Douglas
Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, on February 6 that Mr Patten was about to
proceed with publication of a bill to give effect to his proposals, China's
Mr Qian replied, one day before the February 12 deadline, that Beijing was
prepared to talk.
During February and this month, Mr Patten put off publication of his bill on
four successive occasions as London and Beijing wrangled about the precise
terms on which talks could be held. The stock market went up again while the
hearts of Hong Kong's liberals - supporters of Mr Patten's reform package -
slowly sank.
By last weekend some of those who had been among Mr Patten's most vocal
supporters were suggesting that he was just another British governor who
would end up dancing to Beijing's tune.
But yesterday Mr Patten delighted them and must have shocked the decision
makers in Beijing, by showing that he did after all have what he likes to
call a 'bottom line'. Put simply, he and the British government were not
prepared to let China dictate the composition of his team for the proposed
negotiations between the two sides.
China refused to lift its objection to two ethnic Chinese Hong Kong civil
servants being part of the team, one of whom already has participated on
numerous occasions in Anglo-Chinese talks. China also sought to amend a
previously agreed text of the announcement the two sides would have made
once the date of any talks had been fixed.
As one senior British official suggested yesterday: 'The Chinese may have
got trapped by a device which was shoved into the negotiations by some of
those who did not want talks, and then suddenly found themselves confronted
by problems of face in scrapping that device.'
The most likely candidate for the role of spoiler is Mr Zhou Nan, director
of the New China News Agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong. Mr
Zhou's deputy said yesterday Mr Patten's announcement would 'make talks
impossible'. Britain, he said, had 'ruined the chances for talks and it
showed Whitehall had no sincerity'.
The first reaction from Beijing itself echoed the point about lack of
sincerity, though attributing it to the governor personally, but merely
added that it 'creates difficulties' for the resumption of talks. This may
reflect the more moderate line associated with Mr Lu Ping, head of the
Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office.
If it is true, as some in the Hong Kong government think, that most of the
principal Chinese decision makers are anxious for an agreement with Britain,
they could be expected after a brief display of indignation to return to the
quest for talks. Mr Patten stressed in his speech yesterday that he remains
ready to talk to China.
The same British official admitted, however, that it might be easier for the
governor to carry public opinion with him if his proposals were made more
acceptable to China in the course of debate in the Legislative Council
(LegCo), than if he has to persuade the council to accept amendments agreed
in secret Anglo-Chinese talks in Beijing.
Mr Patten's preference would be to satisfy the calls from local liberals,
such as Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, to introduce his bill
into LegCo sooner rather than later. In the normal course of events a bill
published in the gazette - as Mr Patten's democracy bill was yesterday -
would be tabled in LegCo the following Wednesday. Mr Patten refused
yesterday to commit himself to such a tight timetable, but his officials
indicated he would be unlikely to wait more than a few weeks for a
favourable Chinese response.
If such a response is forthcoming it will indicate that China has recognised
the need to soften its position in response to Britain's tougher stance. But
it is equally likely that Beijing will conclude that such a 'provocation'
calls for even sterner punishment.
In this case Hong Kong could be in for a very rough time over the coming
months, as investor confidence would be shaken. Important projects, such as
the HKDollars 175bn (Pounds 15.8bn) airport and the further development of
the colony's container port, would have to be kept on hold.
Mr Patten is convinced that the people of Hong Kong want a chance to
participate in shaping their political future. Their representatives in
LegCo will have to evaluate the consequences of this unprecedented contest
of wills between an economically resurgent but politically uncertain China
and a Britain, in economic and imperial decline, which belatedly has decided
to stand up.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Letter: Bill and Hillary, maybe - but not President Chelsea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ABDULRAHMAN ABDI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Thompson-Noel, whose columns I enjoy, quotes himself (Hawks &amp;
Handsaws: 'A word from your clutter buddy,' February 27) as telling
President Clinton: 'You could be in the White House for eight years. After
that, Hillary Rodham Clinton could be president, followed by Chelsea (who
will presumably rule the country from 2008 to 2016). We are talking 2016,
William.'
While it is quite possible that Clinton may get re-elected in 1996 and that
his wife, Hillary, may also run the White House for two terms after he
leaves office, it will be impossible for Chelsea to get elected in 2008]
Why? Because she is only 13 years of age and will be 29 by the time both her
father and her mother served two terms each and left office. And our
constitution does not allow the election of 29-year-olds to the Oval Office.
It says: 'Neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not
have attained the age of 35 years'.
Mr Thompson-Noel, who told us that he paid a visit to California and read
light material (like The New York Times and a Joseph Wambaugh novel) should
have picked up a cheap paperback copy of the US Constitution.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Politics and the markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAMAGE inflicted on John Major's government by the anti-Maastricht Tory
rebels is real enough. But it is questionable whether anyone outside Britain
is giving it much thought. This is a month in which momentous events are
unfolding across the developed world.
In the US and Germany, important battles are being fought over fiscal
policy. The political complexion of France is about to change in the
forthcoming election in ways that could have fundamental importance for the
exchange rate mechanism and for Europe itself. Italy is being turned upside
down by efforts to purge a corrupt political system. In Japan, also beset by
scandals, the state of a shaky banking system will be clarified when the
fiscal year ends on March 31. It is the level of the stock market on that
date which will dictate in good measure the value of bank capital.
More disturbing still is the growing uncertainty over the fate of Mr Boris
Yeltsin. Yesterday's nervousness in continental European markets was
prompted partly by the fear of what might happen if he goes. Current
assumptions about the appropriate level of defence spending in the US and
Europe would have to be revised, with obvious consequences for fiscal
policy. This thought will no doubt be at the back of the minds of
representatives of the Group of Seven, as they consider what to do about
Russia this weekend.
So political instability is playing a larger role in world capital markets.
Once again, the nervousness of British equities yesterday over next week's
Budget has echoes elsewhere, especially in Germany. Negotiations between the
German government, the opposition and the federal states over the
post-unification solidarity pact continue to drag on against a background of
declining economic activity, falling corporate profits and labour unrest.
With many forecasters expecting economic declines this year of between 1 and
1 1/2 per cent, the fiscal pressure will increase so long as the haggling
persists.
Nationalism in Europe
Also disturbing were the advances made by extreme right republicans in the
local and city elections in Hesse last weekend. So far, the lack of a
plausible leadership has meant that the nationalist tendency in Germany has
seemed less threatening than it might. But nationalism in Europe is set to
become more dangerous as long as the European economy remains stagnant.
The key to recovery in Europe lies largely in the hands of the Bundesbank.
Members of the Bundesbank council will once again be under considerable
political pressure to reduce rates at their meeting next week, not least
because the French franc has been sinking within the Exchange Rate
Mechanism. The Bank of France was rumoured to have intervened yesterday to
support the franc, and may well have to intervene throughout the period of
political uncertainty. The franc could continue to pose problems for
Europe's central banks once the elections are out of the way, since the
anti-European Gaullists in Mr Jacques Chirac's party will be a more potent
force in the National Assembly after the socialist defeat which seems
inevitable.
There are limits on what the Bundesbank can do to accommodate the franc, but
there is a growing feeling in the markets that it will wish to cut interest
rates again in any case for its own domestic reasons. With the German fiscal
argument unresolved, the cuts may come more slowly than the rest of Europe
now hopes. In the meantime, the French banking system is wilting under the
pressure of high short term rates.
Buoyant equities
With so much uncertainty around, it might seem odd that several of the
world's equity markets have been buoyant for so long. The easiest case to
rationalise is Japan, where buoyancy in part reflects the flood of public
pension fund money that is being pumped into the market before the fiscal
year-end in order to help the banks. The movement has become self-feeding,
since investors are aware of the importance of a successful market rigging
operation to the government. The question is whether the rally will survive
into the next fiscal year.
In the United States, market buoyancy appears to reflect extraordinary
confidence in President Clinton's budget programme. Despite offering a
package of measures that will still leave a substantial structural budget
deficit, he has prompted a euphoric rise in bond prices that has also lent
support to equities. It may be overdone. Yet the present level of prices
also derives backing from a more fundamental factor, namely the penalty
incurred by investors who abandon equities or long-dated bonds for low
yielding cash and money market instruments.
The same thing applies to the UK, where the yield curve has steepened since
last autumn, with short term rates substantially below long rates. That is
the best reason for thinking that, even if there are short term setbacks
arising from political uncertainties around the world, the British market is
still in a bull phase.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Man in the News: Textbook leader with a legal brief - Ruslan
Khasbulatov / John Lloyd on Russia's parliamentary speaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This was the devil's work,' said Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov this week of the
agreement he had signed with President Boris Yeltsin three months ago,
permitting a referendum on the constitutional division of powers in Russia.
In three increasingly febrile days in the Congress of People's Deputies, the
parliamentary speaker has undone that work - and set devils running in the
country whose final destination he cannot know.
'Ruslan Khasbulatov intends to concentrate all power into his own hands,'
said Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin's acid press secretary yesterday.
'We are on the brink of 'All Power to the Soviets'.'
'Khasbulatov wants to retire us,' said a government minister on Thursday
after the speaker had threatened to cut off ministerial salaries. 'He should
be thinking about his own pension soon.'
The man who occupies the parliamentary chair embodies many of the
contradictions which run through Russia: a state which has shed an ideology
of communism while being unable to give up its habits and systems, so
ingrained have they become. Speaking in the name of the popular will, he has
a popularity score (in the most recent poll from the Public Opinion Research
Centre) of only five, less than a quarter of the much-diminished 22 scored
by Mr Yeltsin.
Standing on the grounds of democratic order, he owes his position to a
Soviet-era constitution and his authority over the parliament to the
pre-democratic factional soup which is its politics. Seeking to embody
Russia, he is a Caucasian from Chechnya, an autonomous republic which has
declared its independence from the motherland and which has disowned him as
one of its representatives.
There runs this same division in his career. Born in Chechnya in November
1942 and deported during the war with many of his people to Kazakhstan for
alleged collaboration with the Germans, Mr Khasbulatov grew up in poverty -
'but not moral poverty', as he writes in his recently published memoirs. He
managed to enter the faculty of law at Alma Ata, then Moscow, universities,
later switching to economics (Marxist, naturally, though he says he later
became a convert to Adam Smith).
A rapidly rising career in the Komsomol (young Communist League) put him on
that body's central committee; he taught at the Plekhanov Institute of
Economics in Moscow in the late 1970s to 1990, when he was elected as a
Russian deputy, representing Grozny, the capital of Chechnya.
Much of this was textbook Soviet man: the lad from the poor background
rising to be a leader of society. Though he says he was early to question
the orthodoxy of the party in which he did so well, he only began openly to
criticise that orthodoxy from the perestroika period, when it was relatively
safe to do so.
His breakthrough was in choosing to side with Mr Yeltsin when the latter
became chairman of the Russian parliament in 1990 - a route that most other
members of the parliament's leadership did not take, preferring to side with
the harder-line communists. When Mr Yeltsin was elected president in 1991,
Mr Khasbulatov became acting chairman, or speaker - a position in which he
was confirmed after the August 1991 putsch.
In that putsch he showed, on his own and others' account, considerable
bravery: remaining with Yeltsin and others in the White House when they
believed (with reason) that an attack was being prepared upon them which
they had no hope of resisting. This was the making of him, and of Mr
Yeltsin, and many of the Russian leadership. He and they came out of the
experience with huge prestige, and with an apparently vast will behind
reform, including the radical economic reform for which he had long
agitated.
Yet almost immediately afterwards, in that strange period of months in which
the Russian government drifted inactively and frittered away its store of
support, Mr Khasbulatov turned sharply against the government Mr Yeltsin
appointed, especially Mr Yegor Gaidar, the then deputy prime minister who
headed the economic reform team. 'Little boys who have lost their way' he
called them early in 1992 after the liberalisation of prices. At intervals
throughout the year, he blasted them, the IMF and the foreign advisers who
were leading Russia to perdition. 'Competition,' he wrote late last year,
'cannot flourish in the present conditions.'
Over the past two years, the Supreme Soviets and the Congresses (the first
is the small permanent form of the second) he has chaired have become more
confrontational and critical of the government: time and again, government
ministers, presidents' emissaries, even the president himself have been set
before a bear pit of angry questions and derisive baying.
This is not the work of Mr Khasbulatov alone: indeed, there have been times
when he has moderated it. Some of the deputies were always ideologically
opposed: many more became so. Others are responding to the complaints of
their hard-pressed electorates, frustrated by falling living standards and a
collapse of their institutions.
Mr Yeltsin and his circle have made much of the parliament's origins in
Soviet times. There is a good point in this, but it remains arguable whether
a freely elected parliament would have been more, or less, amenable. What is
sure is that it would have depended less on a speaker who is not
particularly popular, but whose guile, skill and rhetoric wins
cross-factional support.
The economic issue, however, has become secondary to the constitutional one:
it has been at the centre of Mr Khasbulatov's concerns for some time. In his
writings and speeches, he has increasingly come to see the presidency - and
the figure of Mr Yeltsin himself - as at best potentially authoritarian.
Parliament, by contrast, because of its 'open, public style of working', is
a stabilising and democratising factor. 'Parliament protects the government
from a possible slide into severe, authoritarian methods of rule.'
For Mr Yeltsin, by contrast, the imperative has been different: how,
belatedly, to press through economic reform? The answer which has
increasingly suggested itself to him is through strong presidential rule.
But now he has been fought almost to a political standstill by Mr
Khasbulatov's Congress.
Thus, this week, these two men confronted each other - past friends and
comrades; both poor boys made good under two systems; both ruthless,
calculating, bold and limited, at the head of rival and shaky coalitions of
political, economic and clan interests.
Mr Khasbulatov, on his home ground, won. On the first day, reacting to Mr
Yeltsin's clumsy hints about 'special measures', he lambasted the president
for 'devaluing the existing constitution, destabilising the political
situation in the country, even involving the army and the interior and
security ministries'. Parliament, he insisted from the first, wanted
compromise - but 'naturally all of this must be on the basis of the Russian
constitution and the Russian constitution alone'.
He listened, sometimes nodding, as his deputy Mr Nikolai Ryabov told Mr
Yeltsin that 'he cannot be regarded as someone who is the equal of the
Congress: we have no problems with the current division of powers'. But it
was on the second day, after speeches by Mr Yeltsin and Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, demanding more freedom of action and more
power, that he let rip with apparently genuine fury.
The president's men were 'swaggerers before the microphones', the
parliamentarians were honest workers. Venomously, he asked Mr Chernomyrdin
who was boss in his cabinet, demanded the sacking of Mr Anatoly Chubais, the
deputy prime minister for privatisation, threatened to dock ministerial
salaries. Off the cuff, sarcastic, outraged, it was a rhetorical tour de
force, a pointed contrast to a stumbling Mr Yeltsin.
Finally, yesterday, he saw the apparent climax of his efforts: the passing
of a resolution which kills the 'devil's work', and puts the president's
office at the mercy of the parliament. Yet he also has a confrontation on
his hands (which he may not have wanted). Mr Yeltsin, determined on a
referendum, has ended the unequal struggle and is set to bypass, even to
destroy, Mr Khasbulatov's power base. Prolonging the session until today,
the speaker warned his colleagues of possible presidential infractions of
the constitution. The fight begins in earnest.
In it, both men fight for their political lives. Neither has anywhere else
to go, and while Russian politics are theatrical to a fault - with all sides
going to rhetorical extremes then often clawing back to the centre to paper
over an abyss - there is now no route back for either one, save
capitulation. The revolution in which both participated is choking its
children. They cannot escape the coils of a system which winds itself around
their actions, continuing an apparently indestructible life after its
advertised death.

FT  13 MAR 93 / The chancellor's big day: Lamont faces mounting economic and
political pressures as he finalises his Budget decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next Tuesday's Budget is shaping up to be a real cliffhanger. The pressures
on the chancellor have grown, rather than diminished, as his big day has
come closer.
The dilemmas facing Mr Norman Lamont would be sharp enough if the Budget
were just about the economy. But this year's Budget will be a political
occasion of high drama.
After the government's reverses over the Maastricht Bill, Mr John Major will
be looking to the Budget to inject new purpose into his embattled
administration.
Then there is Mr Lamont himself. He has survived against all the odds since
sterling's enforced departure from the European exchange rate mechanism last
September. He desperately needs a successful Budget if he is to fulfil his
personal ambition of staying at No 11 Downing Street.
A month ago, it would probably have been enough for Mr Lamont to present the
Budget as a low-key holding operation that would not upset the prospects for
economic recovery and leave big decisions for the first unified taxing and
spending Budget in November. But there has been a subtle shift in
expectations since then.
As tentative signs of recovery have multiplied, sentiment among City
analysts, Tory members of parliament and within the cabinet has swung
towards a more radical approach to the UK's economic problems. Every new
glimmer of hope about growth has emboldened the supporters of early fiscal
tightening to bring the UK's growing public sector deficits under control
before election deadlines loom.
Throughout, the Treasury has maintained a Sphinx-like silence. Although the
chancellor and other Treasury ministers have been let out of pre-Budget
purdah to comment on economic indicators when they offer hope, or in the
case of Mr Lamont to host an informal gathering of his colleagues from the
Group of Seven leading industrial countries in London, the secrecy
surrounding the Budget has been unusually complete.
This may simply mean that the chancellor has, as is his wont, left decisions
until the very last minute. But it may also reflect the complexity of this
year's Budget judgment.
Rarely can a chancellor have been confronted with such a cacophony of advice
as Mr Lamont in the past 10 weeks.
But the bottom line is that nobody has a clear and persuasive answer as to
whether recovery is safely under way and can be sustained; whether bank base
rates at 6 per cent are at the appropriate level; whether sterling,
following its devaluation of about 15 per cent since September, is correctly
valued or undervalued; how far the UK economy is operating below capacity
and whether, in the event of recovery being maintained, it will run rapidly
into the twin constraints of growing budget and current account balance of
payments deficits.
With so much unclear about the economy, it is not surprising that there is
even more divergence about the measures that Mr Lamont should announce.
Should he heed those who warn that recovery could be aborted by over-hasty
tax increases that would cripple consumer or business confidence? Or,
looking to the medium term, should he acknowledge that some of the Pounds
37bn of public sector deficit forecast for 1992-93 in the government's
Autumn Statement is structural rather than cyclical and needs to be
corrected?
Then again, what instruments should he choose if he takes the path of fiscal
tightening? Will he be tempted to extend the range of value-added tax to
zero-rated or exempt items, such as food, domestic fuel and power or
newspapers and magazines? Or should the chancellor, by tinkering with income
tax allowances, thresholds or mortgage interest relief, take back from those
middle and upper income earners who still have jobs some of the gains they
have made since September through the sharp drop in mortgage rates that has
followed the fall in base rates from 10 to 6 per cent?
If he has been wise, Mr Lamont will have stood back from immediate problems
and pressures and asked himself where he wants to take the British economy
in the medium term. Although current uncertainties might tempt some to
caution, next week's Budget offers a rare chance to complete the process of
rebalancing economic policy started after the ERM crisis and prepare the UK
to compete more successfully over the rest of the 1990s.
The chancellor will have examined the reasons why the recession in Britain
has lasted as long as 10 quarters. If he has listened to the Bank of England
he will have concluded that debt deflation - the corrosive process of
falling asset values undermining enterprise financed on borrowed funds - has
been the main culprit.
Mr Lamont will have asked what lessons he should draw from the near doubling
in recession of the UK current account balance of payments deficit to Pounds
11.9bn last year from Pounds 6.4bn in 1991.
The rise of unemployment above 3m in January and the continuing heavy
shedding of labour by manufacturers in spite of evidence that companies have
withstood this recession in better financial shape than previous recessions
will have coloured his judgment. So will the spread of recession to the UK's
markets in continental Europe just as consumer demand in Britain may be
recovering.
Mr Lamont should regard recent indicators of consumer revival warily. The
recent growth of M0, the narrow money measure comprising mainly notes and
coins in circulation, at above the government's 0 to 4 per cent target
range, and this week's Confederation of British Industry report of further
year-on-year growth of retailers' sales in February suggest recovery is
taking hold.
But is a consumer-led recovery what Britain requires? Most of the nation's
economic problems - the current account deficit, the country's small
industrial base, the heavy indebtedness of families and the continuing toll
of house repossessions - reflect too much consumption in the past.
So while nobody should expect the chancellor to stifle recovery, he will
want his Budget to set the framework for future, more stable growth. That
should mean a Budget for investment, industry and jobs.
If the foregoing analysis is correct, Mr Lamont's first priority will be to
ensure that the present 6 per cent base rates can be maintained for an
extended period. He may even seek scope for a further lowering of rates to
allow the UK's indebted households and companies and battered banks to
rebuild their balance sheets.
But low interest rates have to be earned. That means that the government
must strengthen the credibility of its commitment to low inflation and its
target of keeping underlying inflation in the 1 to 4 per cent target band
announced last year.
Mr Lamont will have to pay particular attention to the mood on financial
markets. So far, domestic and international investors have appeared
relatively untroubled in the face of widespread expectations that the UK's
public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) could reach Pounds 1bn a week
next year.
But markets are fickle. The City is expecting some good news about the
borrowing requirement on Budget Day itself: recent polls of City analysts
suggest they expect the PSBR for 1992-93 will be Pounds 35bn compared with
the Pounds 37bn Autumn Statement forecast.
Most City investment houses expect the chancellor will ease the 'full
funding' rule that at present prevents the government from counting
purchases of gilt-edged stock by banks and building societies as
contributions to financing the budget deficit.
Yet more than financial wheezes will be required if the markets are to give
Mr Lamont their backing. To be sure of the freedom of manoeuvre he needs in
monetary policy, he will have to produce a convincing plan to reduce the
UK's budget deficit.
This suggests Mr Lamont will have to make a downpayment on deficit reduction
next Tuesday. And if he is to fulfil the expectations of parliament and the
nation, he will also have to help the unemployed and hold out hope of job
creation, most probably through helping small businesses.
These goals are difficult to reconcile. But the chancellor has one card  -
low inflation - in his favour.
The UK's present lower than expected inflation rate could encourage the
chancellor to freeze income tax allowances and thresholds, saving some
Pounds 750m; increase by more than inflation some excise duties on tobacco,
petrol and the vehicle excise duty and extend VAT to some goods and services
currently uncovered. Low inflation could give the chancellor the excuse he
needs to cut government spending.
But such a Budget would be a glum affair and unlikely to secure Mr Lamont's
survival. Hence, speculation has grown that he may have something more
spectacular up his sleeve.
With a tax system as complex as Britain's, Mr Lamont has scope to be bold
and pull in revenue without raising the present income tax rates of 20, 25
and 40 per cent.
One option, with mortgage rates low, might be to prune mortgage interest
relief or Miras. Limiting Miras to the 20 per cent tax band would cost
households only Pounds 10 a month and yet be a big step forward to phasing
out a system which distorts the economy. He might also turn the personal
allowance - the amount which everyone can earn before paying tax - into a
tax credit at the basic tax rate of 25 per cent rather than subtract it, as
at present, from gross income in a system that benefits the 40 per cent tax
payer.
Such steps would be painful for Tory voters - and could open the government
to the charge of betraying the spirit, if not the letter, of the 1992
election campaign. But some of the revenue gained could be used to extend
the 20 per cent tax rate beyond its present Pounds 2,000 limit, widen the
tax-free personal allowance, or provide help to first-time home buyers.
In his previous two Budgets, Mr Lamont has proven to be a master of
surprise. In 1991 he increased VAT to pay for a poll tax cut, and in 1992
introduced the 20 per cent tax band. These moves were dictated more by
electoral politics than economic considerations.
This year he could again confound his detractors while placing the UK on a
sounder footing for non-inflationary growth. If he succeeds, he may be
singing in the bath of Number 11 Downing Street for longer than anyone
expects.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Is the economy showing any flickers of life?: With the
Budget three days away, Financial Times reporters have taken the temperature
of Britain to see whether economic recovery really is under way. There are
some grounds for optimism but a good deal of uncertainty remains
</HEADLINE>

HAMILTON-FAZEY, ROLAND ADBURGHAM, PAUL CHEESERIGHT and GILLIAN TETT

<TEXT>
IT IS 17 months since Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, told his party
faithful in Blackpool: 'The green shoots of economic spring are appearing
once again.' One year ago, Mr John Major, the prime minister, assured an
election campaign meeting in Nottingham: 'The recession will end when the
election is over.'
Their premature optimism has haunted them ever since.
Next week, Mr Lamont presents his third Budget and risks derision if he is
bold enough to claim that revival is under way. But, this time, there could
be something in it. A clutch of figures published in the past few days
suggest that the longest recession since the 1930s may be ending.
Housebuilders report sales rising by more than a fifth in the first eight
weeks of the year. Registrations of new cars rose by 16 per cent in
February, though only against the worst monthly sales figure since 1976.
The appetite for buying on credit also appears to be improving, with
consumer borrowing rising in January to three times the level expected.
Some of the latest company results for 1992 have pleasantly surprised the
City and have been accompanied by increasingly optimistic forecasts.
But there have been several false dawns. As Mr Joe Logan, managing director
of Scotsman Publications, says: 'You get green shoots at this time of year.
But you can also get five degrees of frost.'
The brighter his view of underlying economic prospects, the more prepared
the chancellor will be to consider unpopular measures in his attempts to
narrow the widening gap in government finances. The more fragile the economy
remains, the less willing he will be to contemplate any measures capable of
sabotaging recovery.
So as the chancellor fine-tunes his 'make-or-break' Commons statement, the
Financial Times has sought to test the business mood of the nation to see if
recovery is really under way and, if so, to what extent.
The first impressions are of a country which believes the worst really is
over, that the economy has bottomed out. Parts of the north have escaped the
harshest effects of the recession and report improving conditions. Mr Trevor
Furlong, managing director of the port of Liverpool, says: 'We are coming
out the other side.'
In the south, confidence has taken such a battering that signs of limited
improvements in economic activity are treated with scepticism. Throughout
the country, there is nagging uncertainty about what happens next.
Consumer confidence is hailed by politicians and industrialists as the
all-important missing ingredient for recovery. So far, it remains in short
supply. The position is encapsulated by Mr Ian Lawrie, a Nottingham
department store manager: 'Trade is fragile, fickle, undependable but,
tantalisingly, showing little glimpses of improvement.'
Not surprisingly, the outlook for employment - among the last beneficiaries
of revival - remains generally bleak.
Manufacturing industry is slowly regaining its confidence. Express
Engineering, a family-owned engineering business in Gateshead, says some
orders are up three times on a year ago, most of them from UK companies
planning to boost output.
Mr Christopher Moore, managing director of Rigby Maryland, a West Yorkshire
wire manufacturer, reports his 'best January ever' with a good February to
follow. More jobs are to be created.
Profits are another matter: 'Profitability - what's that word?' asks Mr Alan
Armitage of Armitage Engineering in Washington, Tyne and Wear: 'The name of
the game is survival. The nicest thing anybody in accounts could ever say to
me is 'You've broken even'.'
A steady improvement in commercial activity is reflected in the volume of
national telephone traffic. Both fixed and mobile telephone networks point
to more domestic and business calls. There are more new connections and
customers are spending more despite some cuts in charges.
Parts of the packaging industry are seeing signs of an upturn, but it is
difficult to draw conclusions. Moreover, as the industry supplies much of
what it produces to the food industry, it has been cushioned to some extent
from the recession.
Mr John Cobring, marketing manager at United Glass, one of the UK's largest
glass container manufacturers, said sales grew 1 per cent last year. But
after a quiet January, sales in February were up 4 per cent on the previous
February.
The housing market, which heralded the arrival of the recession, is also
expected to lead the economy back to higher ground. Here, there are real
grounds for encouragement.
Residential property markets are increasingly active and, most importantly,
this time the trend appears as though it is being sustained. Builders are
again selling and mortgage lending is rising, though prices may not respond
for a long time. Mr Mike Jackson, chief executive of Birmingham Midshires
Building Society says 'business is on the up', with mortgage offers in early
1993 tripling from a year earlier. Mr Jim Philbin of Norwich and
Peterborough Building Society reports a big upturn in interest which has
'taken us a bit by surprise'.
Britain has been waiting so long for good news, it seems, that it might take
some considerable time for evidence of any lasting upturn to sink in.

'I sense a pent-up optimism here, a wish for things to get better, a
greater willingness to see the end of it. But while the (Edinburgh)
store tended to be strong throughout 1992 and often led John Lewis'
mature stores in terms of sales growth, in the last five weeks we have
struggled a little. Sales increases averaged 5 or 6 per cent for much
of the last financial year, but were only 3.3 per cent for the first
four weeks of the new year. Furniture and carpet sales have held up and
the appetite for consumer electronics is astonishing.'

the 0.8 per cent it saw for the previous half year. Newcastle came out
of the recession of the early 1980s later than the south of England,
and went into the current recession later. 'There has been some upturn
in sales of electrical appliances, including both white goods and
electronics and TV. People who are in work do have some disposable
income, and as they are not moving house they seem to be spending it on

If John Lewis is increasing sales, often we are getting a little bit

repeating the lack of pattern, the lack of stability, of the last 12

FT  13 MAR 93 / Official figures show oil and gas sectors excluded from
falling output
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTPUT in every sector of the UK economy, excluding oil and gas extraction,
was flat or falling in the final quarter of last year according to official
figures released yesterday.
Revised data from the Central Statistical Office confirm that gross domestic
product rose by 0.2 per cent in the last three months of 1992 compared with
the previous quarter. This left GDP up 0.1 per cent on the same quarter a
year earlier.
GDP excluding oil was flat quarter-on-quarter compared with a provisional
0.1 per cent fall. It was 0.1 per cent lower than a year before.
Many analysts are confident that the revised figures are consistent with an
economic turning point. Mr Kevin Gardiner of SG Warburg said he now expected
to see forecasts for growth this year nudge upwards.
According to Consensus Economics, a consultancy, the latest mean forecast
for growth this year among City economists is 1.1 per cent. This compares
with the Treasury's forecast of 1 per cent, and last month's consensus of 1
per cent.
The figures also confirmed that domestic demand fell by 0.3 per cent in the
final quarter compared with the previous quarter after five successive
quarterly gains.
The drop in domestic demand reflected a sharp increase in the rate of
destocking. Inventories fell by Pounds 711m in the fourth quarter after
falls of Pounds 495m and Pounds 299m in the second and third quarters
respectively.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Business body angry at 'snub'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was acc-used yesterday of snubbing Britain's largest
small-business organisation by failing to send a minister to the annual
conference of the Federation of Small Businesses.
The 58,000-member federation said this was the first time in many years that
a minister had not attended its conference in Bournemouth, which ends
tomorrow. Three hundred delegates have attended for debates on subjects such
as the recession, the role of small businesses in economic recovery, the
Maastricht treaty and the Budget.
'It is a snub,' said Mr Ian Handford, chairman of the federation's policy
unit. 'It confirms our view that the government is paying lip service when
it comes to practical policies for small firms.
'We have more members than the CBI and the Institute of Directors put
together and we feel a minister should have been here to listen to our
views.'
The federation said it had asked Mr John Major to attend, but the invitation
had been passed on to Baroness Denton, small firms minister at the
Department of Trade and Industry. They finally invited Mr Bill Cash, a Tory
Euro-rebel MP, who accepted an invitation to talk about the Maastricht
treaty.
The DTI said the invitation had reached Baroness Denton only a month ago and
she could not change her programme, which involved visits to Devon and
Cornwall.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Government seeks to allay fear of 'mad cow' disease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT veterinary and health experts were yesterday putting out
reassuring messages about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or 'mad
cow' disease, in the face of growing public anxiety.
Dr Kenneth Calman, the government's chief medical officer, yesterday
repeated the official advice that beef can be eaten safely: 'There is no
scientific evidence of a causal link between BSE in cattle and CJD in
humans.'
One cause of concern is that the number of cases is continuing to rise, in
spite of forecasts from the Ministry of Agriculture that the incidence of
cases would peak last year and then decline rapidly. Farmers reported 8,581
animals with BSE during the first nine weeks of this year compared with
8,099 in the same period last year.
Another fear is that BSE could cause illness in humans. It was revealed this
week that Mr Peter Warhurst, a dairy farmer whose herd had a BSE case in
1989, died last year of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease. Both BSE and CJD are
caused by mysterious particles of infectious protein called prions.
Dr Robert Will of Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, who is monitoring all
CJD cases in the UK for the Department of Health, drew attention to Mr
Warhurst's case without naming him in the Lancet, a medical journal. He says
he now regrets writing to the Lancet because of the unnecessary alarm
caused.
Statistical analysis, taking account of the average national incidence of
CJD and the number of people working on BSE-affected dairy farms, shows that
the probability of one CJD case having occurred among the latter group by
chance is about 1 in 20.
Even so, Dr Will believes that Mr Warhurst's disease was a coincidence not
related to BSE exposure. His study has shown no change in the pattern of CJD
since BSE started and no other cases among people working with cattle, such
as abattoir staff or vets.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Fall in savings points to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIVIDUALS were less inclined to save in the final quarter of last year, a
trend consistent with evidence of a modest recovery in consumer spending.
Figures published yesterday showed that the savings ratio, which measures
personal savings as a percentage of total income, dropped from a seasonally
adjusted 12.3 per cent in the third quarter to an adjusted 11.4 per cent in
the fourth quarter.
The fall, which coincided with several reductions in UK interest rates, took
the ratio back to roughly the same level as at the beginning of the year.
The drop was widely expected as high redundancy payments in the third
quarter had boosted the savings ratio to an eight-year high.
For last year as a whole the ratio was 11.6 per cent compared with 9.7 per
cent in 1991.
The Central Statistical Office figures also showed that personal disposable
income rose a slim 0.3 per cent in the final quarter compared with the
third. An increase of 1 per cent in prices over the same period, however,
meant that in real terms, personal disposable income was 0.8 per cent lower.
Compared with the same quarter in 1991, real personal disposable income was
2.5 per cent higher.
Consumer expenditure in the final quarter rose by 1 per cent and by 3.9 per
cent compared with the same quarter the year before.
The state of company finances continued to improve on an annual basis with
seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO showing a financial deficit of
Pounds 10.5bn last year compared with Pounds 11.1bn in 1991. However, this
was less than half the size of the deficit in 1989 when it was Pounds
22.7bn.
In the final quarter the deficit narrowed to Pounds 1.4bn from Pounds 1.7bn
in the third quarter.
Gross trading profits of the corporate sector, net of stock appreciation,
stayed at about Pounds 19.7bn in the final quarter. The figure was
maintained by North Sea oil companies' gross trading profits which increased
by 18 per cent from Pounds 1.5bn in the third quarter to Pounds 1.8bn in the
fourth.
Trading profits from non-North Sea oil companies fell in the final quarter
compared with the third quarter from Pounds 18.2bn to Pounds 17.9bn.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Industrial espionage laws placed under surveillance: John
Mason on questions raised by the NCP trial and the furtive methods used by
security companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two defendants in the National Car Parks industrial espionage trial
walked free from the Old Bailey yesterday - but left behind them calls for
reform of the law about the secretive methods used by private security
organisations in the commercial world.
Mr Gordon Layton, chief executive of NCP, and Mr Simon Hewitt, a former
manager with KAS, the security firm hired by NCP to spy on a business rival,
were acquitted of conspiracy to defraud.
That followed a two-month trial in which details of their spying operation
were never in dispute. The operation included surveillance of directors of
Europarks, the target company, rifling of dustbins and briefcases, and the
use of infiltrators to obtain confidential financial information.
Under the law, none of these techniques is illegal in itself. The law is
broken only when the intention is to damage the interests of the target
company. In this case the prosecution agreed there was no evidence that
Europarks had suffered as a result of the espionage operation.
Calls for clarification of the law were led by lawyers acting for Mr Layton
who had rested their defence on the assurances given to him by KAS that its
methods were legal.
The calls were echoed by solicitors from other law firms which have been
frequent, if discreet, hirers of private security firms. 'The law is
unclear,' said one solicitor. 'There has also been the temptation for us to
be somewhat disingenuous about how information is obtained - that must now
change.'
Mr Layton first heard of KAS, the security firm formed by the late Sir David
Stirling, founder of the Special Air Service, in late 1986. The firm
employed several former members of the regiment.
Mr Layton had become concerned about the inroads Europarks was making into
NCP's dominance of the car-parking market. He suspected that Mr Steven
Tucker, Europarks chairman, was undercutting NCP to win prime-site contracts
by obtaining inside information from NCP.
A meeting with Sir David was arranged and Mr Layton, impressed by the
organisation's SAS background and its claims to offer the 'Rolls-Royce' of
corporate investigations services, hired KAS to investigate both Europarks
and security within NCP. But Mr Layton had apparently misjudged KAS.
In the security business KAS had acquired the reputation of a poorly managed
concern, still wrapped up in the mythology and thinking of its SAS ancestry.
One witness told the court that considerable time was once spent discussing
how the company should defend itself against a possible IRA attack on its
Mayfair offices.
The staff at KAS may have been highly trained, but the organisation lacked
the managerial control to question properly the wisdom or legality of
applying techniques of covert military work to the commercial world, said
the director of one security firm.
But however bizarre and badly managed KAS may have been, it did ultimately
succeed in discovering the most confidential financial secrets of its rival.
The operation was headed by Mr Ian Crooke, a former colonel in the SAS. He
would have appeared in the dock alongside Mr Layton and Mr Hewitt, but has
remained in South Africa beyond the reach of the UK's extradition powers.
Early in 1987 Mr David Paterson, who before joining KAS had once been a
Rhodesian policeman, carried out initial investigations and said he could
find no evidence of dirty tricks by Europarks. Its success, he reported, was
based on trimming all its costs down to the absolute minimum.
This did not satisfy Mr Layton. He ordered KAS to maintain surveillance on
Europarks. For the next year Mr Tucker, his family and other Europarks
directors were closely followed by KAS staff. This provided little
information except worthless tittle-tattle.
So, in February 1988, KAS stepped up its operation. Realising it needed an
insider to obtain the information it wanted, the firm set about trying to
infiltrate Europarks.
A KAS employee, known during the trial as 'Witness E', obtained a job as a
kiosk manager at Europarks' Heathrow offices. But he was in too low a
position to get the information needed. What was necessary, KAS decided, was
an insider in Europarks' management.
By May 1989 Mr Crooke had left Britain to look after KAS's anti-poaching
activities in southern Africa. Mr Simon Hewitt, a member of the Territorial
Army SAS, was brought in as a replacement manager and took charge of the NCP
account.
He recruited Ms Jane Turpin, a former Army captain, to KAS. Using a false
CV, she secured a job with Europarks as Mr Tucker's personal assistant.
With free access to his offices there was little she could not obtain. In
six months she provided a welter of confidential information about the
company's finances. It was crucial information, which, Mr Tucker said, laid
bare the soul of his company.
Ms Turpin - who but for health reasons would also have been prosecuted  -
left Europarks in November 1989, and the operation, which had cost NCP more
than Pounds 46,000, was wound up.
The operation would never have come to light but for a dispute within KAS.
Mr Hewitt had not proved a popular choice with his colleagues and, in early
1990, he was sacked. He approached a Sunday newspaper with the NCP story,
which appeared in print in June 1990. The day before, when approached for
his reaction, was the first time that Mr Tucker had heard anything of the
three-year operation against his company.
The calls for clarification of the law on industrial espionage may not be
easy to carry out. The issues are complex, particularly the question of
using pretexts, said Mr Stephen Smith, a director of Carratu, an established
security firm.
To him the KAS operation was ill-advised and one whose objects could have
been reached equally well using methods that were more acceptable and
clearly legal.
But he questioned whether infiltration was a significant problem compared
with other, more obviously illicit activity. Leaving aside industrial
espionage, more information is obtained by companies prepared to use the
illegal technique of old-fashioned bribery, he suggested.

FT  13 MAR 93 / JCB wins right to build factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is to allow JC Bamford Excavators, one of the UK's largest
privately owned groups, to build a plant in the green belt near Cheadle,
Staffordshire.
The decision, announced yesterday by the Department of Environment,
overrides the recommendation of Mrs Mary McClune, the planning inspector who
last September held a public inquiry and concluded that JCB's application
should be rejected.
The government has thus breached its normal planning restrictions on
developments in the green belt. Planning policy hitherto has discouraged
green belt developments in favour of encouraging the redevelopment of
inner-city areas. This policy was emphasised, especially in the home
counties, by Conservative politicians before the last general election.
The planned JCB plant, covering 15,220 square metres, would house JCB
Special Products, making skid steer loaders and small back low loaders
presently manufactured at Uttoxeter, Staffordshire.
In a letter to Kent Jones and Done, JCB's solicitors in Stoke-on-Trent, the
environment department noted that the development was 'inappropriate' but
said that 'in this most exceptional of cases' economic benefits outweighed
such harm as might be caused to the green belt.
JCB's application was supported by Staffordshire County Council.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Fishermen call for EC ban on imports of Russian cod
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERMEN's leaders yesterday called for a European Community import ban on
Russian cod but held back from supporting a blockade of ports.
Officials of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which
represents most fishermen in England and Wales, called for the ban during a
meeting in Grimsby, where fishermen this week stopped lorries from
delivering Russian fish to the local market.
The decision not to back a more widespread campaign of protest action
reflects the wish of fishermen's leaders not to fuel the kind of violent
protests that have occurred in France.
The UK Association of Frozen Food Producers yesterday warned that any import
ban could lead to a shortage of fish by the summer.
Mr Geoffrey Molloy, the association's chairman, said: 'Banning cod imports
will not help the consumer and will certainly not help prices. The increases
in landings which the fishermen complain about are, in fact, caught by UK
fishermen themselves.'
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said yesterday that the
government would not back the fishermen's call for a ban at next week's EC
council of fisheries ministers.
'We need to look after the fish-processing industry . . . It is a big
business in the UK,' the ministry said.
Mr Stephen Pearse, assistant port manager at Grimsby, warned yesterday that
action might have to be taken against fishermen if the unofficial blockade
began to affect the port's business. He added that the blockade this week
was not as big as some reports had suggested.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Operation Cheetah will continue its hunt: Merseyside
investigation to carry on after Hatton's acquittal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY's acquittal of Mr Derek Hatton and his three co-defendants on
fraud charges comes nearly 10 years after he led a group of councillors from
the far left of the Labour party to take control of Liverpool City Council.
The prosecution at Mold Crown Court in Wales was part of Operation Cheetah,
a Merseyside police fraud squad investigation, which in three years involved
23 arrests and threw a cloud of suspicion over Liverpool City Council.
Even now, the police have said that the operation will continue.
At one stage, more than 30 officers were involved. Police went to the US,
Spain and Ireland - at home, they raided the offices and homes of senior
executives and directors of leading companies.
Only one executive was charged - Mr Roy Stewart, managing director of
Rogersons Developments, a building company. Mr Stewart was discharged on the
judge's direction last week at the end of the prosecution case.
Mr Hatton was alleged to have improperly used his influence with two former
councillors - Ms Hannah Folan and Mr John Nelson - to help ensure sites for
carparks were leased to Mr John Monk, Mr Hatton's tailor.
Mr Nelson, who formerly chaired the council's planning committee, was one of
47 Labour councillors disqualified from office in March 1987 for alleged
financial mismanagement along with Mr Hatton. Ms Folan was one of the Labour
replacements elected the following May. She chaired the estates
sub-committee, which deals with lettings, but left the council in 1991.
Mr Hatton, always dapper and well-dressed, was a prominent customer of Mr
Monk, whose tailoring business was near the offices of Settleside, Mr
Hatton's PR company.
All the defendants exercised their right not to give evidence at the end of
the prosecution case, which revealed that deals to sell or lease Liverpool's
assets were often negotiated and not always advertised.
Since the prosecution was alleging Liverpool had been defrauded because it
might have got more by leasing the carpark land to someone other than Mr
Monk, lack of certainty about prices and methods of deciding them was
crucial. Not surprisingly, the jury - after 7 1/2 hours of deliberation -
refused to convict on the evidence.
In Mr Hatton's heyday, Liverpool City Council was notionally led by Mr John
Hamilton, a Labour moderate and headteacher who thought he could control the
far left. But he soon found that real power lay with Liverpool's district
Labour party, which often told the caucus of Labour councillors what to do.
The real leader was Mr Hatton, Mr Hamilton's deputy. Mr Hatton, a natural
orator and showman was a social worker employed by the neighbouring borough
of Knowsley. He admitted that he supported the ideas of the Militant, a
weekly publication describing itself as 'the Marxist newspaper for Labour
and youth'.
The council borrowed from foreign banks to fund its policy of economic
regeneration through building council houses. In 1985, with little money
left to pay wages, the leadership tried to make more than 30,000 employees
redundant.
In one of his strongest speeches, Mr Neil Kinnock, then Labour leader,
denounced the Liverpool leaders' behaviour as 'grotesque'. Mr Kinnock then
set about removing what had become an electoral liability. The district
Labour party was suspended and a purge began.
The government also acted. In 1987, 47 Labour councillors were disqualified
from public office for five years and surcharged for alleged financial
mismanagement. The surcharges - which with legal costs eventually exceeded
Pounds 700,000 - were paid after several years of fund-raising in the Labour
and union movements.
Out of office, Mr Hatton continued to make a living as a media personality,
star of TV commercials and public relations consultant.
His company, Settleside, offered lobbying services founded on an intimate
knowledge of local government. It went into liquidation after Operation
Cheetah began and publicity drove its corporate clients away.
Its legacy for Mr Hatton is understood to be a well-financed pension fund
that liquidators cannot touch and which will ensure an affluent retirement.
But Mr Hatton still has a bill likely to run into thousands of pounds to
settle first - the judge yesterday refused him costs.

FT  13 MAR 93 / City settles on the way ahead after Taurus: Richard Waters
on suggestions for handling share transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a surprising unanimity in the City yesterday over what should
replace Taurus, the London Stock Exchange's proposed settlement system,
which was declared dead on Thursday.
Different sections of the securities industry have different interests, but
there seemed to be agreement over the general direction that future
development should take.
First, individual shareholders should be left out of the first stage of the
development. Taurus had been conceived from the point of view of
institutional investors, and getting the large volume of private
shareholdings on to an automated system would add to the complexity and
cost.
Second, the Stock Exchange already has an automated settlement system which
could be adapted to handle much of what Taurus was meant to do. Called
Talisman, it was introduced as long ago as 1979 and is used to settle
bargains between marketmakers. Each marketmaker has a nominee account in
which they group together all their holdings.
In theory, institutional investors could be offered such accounts, as could
a stockbroker which maintained a nominee account for its clients - in effect
allowing a retail stockbroker to take part in the automated settlement
system.
Third, the stock market should move quickly to a system of 'rolling
settlement'. Share bargains are now settled once a fortnight: under rolling
settlement all transactions would be settled a set number of days after they
took place. With institutional investors in Talisman, the settlement cycle
could be as little as five or even three days. Individual investors, outside
the system and still using share certificates, could settle on a 10-day
cycle.
The idea of different settlement cycles was discussed during the Taurus
project. At that time marketmakers agreed that the different cycles would
not lead to institutional and private investors buying and selling shares at
different prices.
There was less agreement yesterday on how, if shares were held in nominee
accounts, companies could draw up complete share registers as they are
legally obliged to do. Companies would be able to comply with their legal
obligations by drawing up a register which simply showed the amount of their
stock held in each nominee account.
To find out more, companies would have to employ agents to make inquiries of
each nominee to draw up a picture of their share registers. However, this
private register would take time to compile and would be unavailable to an
outsider.
One way round this would be a central registry, which would construct a
complete record of a company's shareholdings.
Technically this would be easy to achieve. A system already developed by a
UK registrar could be bought by an independent clearing house and run for
the interests of the City as a whole.
This would put the existing bank-owned service registrars out of business,
and could curtail severely the operations of the bank-owned custodians. But
the Bank of England has made clear that some interests are likely to be
trampled in the pursuit of a quick and cheap solution.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Horton's BP pay-off revives anger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Horton received Pounds 780,000 in compensation and Pounds 722,740
in a special pension payment on his departure as BP's chairman and chief
executive last year, the company's annual report showed yesterday.
The total pay-off of Pounds 1.53m has revived shareholder anger over
severance pay. Institutions questioned whether top executives should be on
three-year service contracts, although they said Mr Horton's case was not
one of the worst.
Under the present system the service contract is taken as the basis for
calculating severance pay. Until recently the contract for top executives
was frequently as long as five years, although the Cadbury committee on
corporate governance last year recommended a maximum of three years.
Mr Paddy Linaker, chief executive of M&amp;G, the fund management company, said:
'We think Cadbury was on the lenient side - one year is perfectly adequate
in most cases.'
The size of a pay-off is adjusted according to the probability of the
director getting a new job at the same salary. This leaves some room for
argument.
Mr Chris Osman, of solicitors Clifford Chance, said: 'There is no such thing
as the going rate for severance pay. For a three-year contract, 18 months to
two years might be reasonable for people not eminently employable
elsewhere.'
In 1991 Mr Horton received a basic salary of Pounds 480,000 and a bonus of
Pounds 307,000.
BP's payment to Mr Horton means that he has joined a select club of
executives who have picked up seven-figure sums after parting company with
their employers.
The other members include Sir Ralph Halpern, the former head of Burton who
received about Pounds 2m; and Mr Peter Scott who received about Pounds 2m
when he left Aegis, the media buying group.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Smith heaps scorn on Tory 'chaos'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday heaped scorn on Mr John Major,
the prime minister, comparing him to a rabbit caught 'blinking in the glare
as the juggernaut of slump and recession comes bearing down on him'.
He told the Labour party's Scottish conference in Inverness: 'You point out
to him, as kindly as you can, that he should be doing something, but still
he blinks and he bleats that his critics are talking the country down.'
It had been a remarkable week in British politics, Mr Smith said. 'We have
witnessed the chaos at the heart of this government.' The humiliating defeat
on the Maastricht vote was self-inflicted because Mr Major had refused to
accept Labour's amendment on the composition of the European council of the
regions.
Instead Mr Major had been 'anxious to display his tactical skills as a
dazzling political leader' and had taken on the Tory rebels at Harrogate
last weekend. 'On Saturday he blustered that the Tory party must unite or be
defeated. On Monday in the Commons he got his answer in the division lobby.'
Mr Smith delighted his audience by attacking the Scottish National party for
voting with the government on Monday as a result of a 'shady, backstairs
deal' with Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary. 'Even from our flexible
friends in the SNP it was a remarkable display of opportunism,' he said.
This week's discomfiture of the SNP has boosted the morale of the
conference. This is even though it was Labour's first Scottish conference
since the general election defeat, in which the party's share of the vote in
Scotland went down 3 percentage points to 39 per cent and it lost one seat.
Mr Smith ridiculed the government's white paper on the government of
Scotland, which contains plans for greater use of the Scottish grand
committee of Scottish MPs, and more administrative devolution to the
Scottish Office. 'It takes some believing that this timorous tokenism is the
sum total of the government's vision of Scotland,' he said.
Mr Smith was involved in drafting Labour's plans for a Scottish assembly
when he was in government up to 1979 and yesterday emphasised his belief in
devolution. He said yesterday that Labour would settle for nothing less than
a Scottish parliament, which would involve the transfer of legislative and
political power from London.
'I passionately want to see that Scottish parliament established. It is for
me unfinished business.' A Labour government would in its first year carry
through the act to establish a Scottish parliament. It would also set up an
assembly in Wales and regional governments in England.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the NASUWT, the second-largest teachers' union, have been
instructed to boycott testing and assessment connected with the national
curriculum in England and Wales. This follows a ballot in which an
overwhelming majority voted for the action.
The action is unlikely to affect this year's tests, now under way, for
seven-year-olds, as the union has few members in primary schools. It could
disrupt the tests in the summer of 14-year-olds, including the introduction
of the controversial new English tests.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, last night said it was a sad decision
which would harm children's education.
The NUT, the largest teachers' union, is to ballot its members in May over a
boycott of the English tests.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Fulham FC in GMB strip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GMB general union yesterday agreed a sponsorship deal with Fulham
Football Club. In exchange for a little less than Pounds 10,000, the players
at the Division II west London club will wear the GMB logo on their shirts
for the last 12 games of the season, of which three will be televised, and
the union will be able to use the club's hospitality box for negotiations.
Fulham has had mixed fortunes. The England star Johnny Haynes, the first
Pounds 100-a-week footballer, helped to keep the club at the top in the
1950s and 1960s but it later became better known as a pre-retirement stop
for players such as George Best, Bobby Moore, and Rodney Marsh. It is now
mid-table in the second division and has just secured its future with a
lease arrangement for its ground.
The union is backing Fulham partly because it is cheap and partly because
the club is inoffensive enough not to arouse hostile feel-ings in the GMB's
football-following members. The idea came from the local Hammersmith branch
 -the union claims more than 4,000 members in the borough of Hammersmith and
Fulham.
Mr Paul Kenny, the union's London secretary, hopes the deal will show that
'modern trade unions are an important pillar of the community'.
The GMB has a long history of involvement with sport. Mr Tom Burlison, its
deputy general secretary, is a former professional footballer, and the union
provides advice to several sports associations.

<TEXT>
WESTERN countries' use of aid as a 'sweetener' to help companies win
contracts overseas has fallen sharply in the past year, according to aid
donors meeting in Paris this week.
The value of tied aid, and other credits seen as trade boosting, fell from
Dollars 10bn in 1991 to Dollars 4bn last year, according to the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The improvement follows the controversial introduction in February last year
of the so-called Helsinki accord, which banned the use of tied aid for
projects that are 'commercially viable', or in better-off developing
countries. It called for close monitoring of contracts where there is
suspicion that aid is being mixed with commercial financing to help
companies win tenders.
More than 300 such projects were notified during 1992, but only 30 needed
detailed examination. Of these, fewer than half were found to break the new
rules, an OECD official said.
'There has been a tremendous shift towards credits that are less suspect of
being trade motivated,' the official said, noting at the same time that the
slump between 1991 and 1992 may have been exaggerated by governments pushing
sensitive loans through in 1991, ahead of the Helsinki accord deadline.
Aid donors, in particular the US, fought hard throughout 1991 for the
reforms, which are intended to ensure aid funds are used for proper aid
purposes, rather than as covert subsidies for exporters.
Controversy erupted just two weeks before the ban came into force, when
Spain launched large export credit lines to Venezuela and Mexico - neither
of which are eligible for tied-aid funding under the Helsinki rules. Spain
was not forced to withdraw the credits, with a compromise agreed under
special transitional rules.
There was uncertainty throughout last year over whether governments would
change practices, not least because of difficulties in defining whether a
project was 'commercially viable'.

FT  13 MAR 93 / US to close 31 military bases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, , yesterday recommended closing 31
major military bases in the US and scaling back operations at a further 134
installations.
The reductions, he estimated, would produce savings on the defence budget of
Dollars 3.1bn (Pounds 2.18bn) a year, starting in the year 2000. But he
conceded that 57,000 civilian and 24,000 military jobs would be lost.
His proposals are already under fire in Congress. The independent base
closure and realignment commission has until July 1 to consider them and
forward a final recommendation to the president, who has a further two
months in which to take final action.
Conscious of the controversy, President Bill Clinton has gone to some
lengths to soften the blow. Yesterday he was on an aircraft carrier off the
Virginia coast, demonstrating solidarity with the troops, while on Thursday
he annnounced a Dollars 20bn four-year defence conversion plan which he
dubbed 'swords into ploughshares.'
Mr Aspin admitted yesterday that the proposed base closures would hurt local
economies. California, already deep in recession with unemployment just
under 10 per cent, takes the hardest hit, losing over more than 30,000
military and civilian jobs as a result of closing and consolidation.
Five affected facilities are in the congressional district represented by Mr
Ron Dellums, now chairman of the House armed services committee and a long
time critic of military profligacy. But special pleading by senator Dianne
Feinstein and congressman Vic Fazio appears to have saved two famous
installations, McLellan Air Force base outside Sacramento and the Monterey
Presidio facility which houses the military's language school.
The navy, with 23 of the 31 proposed closures, takes the hardest hit. If Mr
Aspin's proposals are implemented, it will be left with just two main ports
in the US, in San Diego and Norfolk, Virginia, down from the seven of
President Ronald Reagan's era.
Abroad, 29 installations are to close: 14 in Germany, eight in Greece, four
in the Netherlands and two in Britain.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Clinton backs anti-trust move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House has given strong backing to legislation which could
discriminate against US subsidiaries of foreign companies in relaxing
anti-trust penalties for joint production ventures.
The bill, introduced by Congressman Jack Brooks and Senator Patrick Leahy,
was hailed by President Bill Clinton as 'just the kind of forward-thinking
initiative we need.' With White House backing, it is expected to move
swiftly through Congress.
The National Co-operative Research Act Extension is modelled on legislation
passed in 1984 which allowed US companies to join together for research and
development. This made way for the formation of Sematech, an
industry-government venture which has been credited with helping to restore
the US lead in chip-making technology.
Now, said Mr Clinton, it is 'altogether appropriate to lift the legal
barriers that prevent good companies from playing to win in the global
market - provided, of course, that our anti-trust laws continue to prevent
improper collusion.'
The legislation removes the threat of treble damages in anti-trust
violations providing that the joint ventures' principal production
facilities are located in the US. The companies must also be American or
from countries which 'treat US companies fairly under their anti-trust laws
governing joint production ventures'. A Congressional aide declined to say
which foreign governments deny US subsidiaries 'fair treatment'. Lawyers say
this creative use of 'reciprocity' for anti-trust exemptions will discourage
foreign participation in joint ventures.

FT  13 MAR 93 / US steps up skirmish with EC over state procurement
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday raised the stakes in its trade conflict with the EC by
closing off an estimated Dollars 40-50m chunk of its government procurement
market to EC companies. The action is in retaliation for the Community's
government procurement rules which the US claims 'discriminate' against
foreign companies.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US Trade Representative, yesterday said he had
cancelled a meeting planned for next week which might have averted the
sanctions. They are to go into effect on March 22.
At the EC delegation in Washington, Ms Ella Krucoff, said officials in
Brussels had been caught off guard by the cancellation, which was
'unnecessarily aggressive' and 'very unbusiness-like'. She asked: 'How can
progress be made if the negotiators aren't even allowed to meet?'
US and EC negotiators have discussed the issue by telephone and made no
progress. 'There is no reason to hold a meeting unless there was some
prospect of success,' Mr Kantor said. 'The sanctions will go into effect as
planned.'
The sanctions will set off a minor explosion in Brussels, where fears of
trade wars have been building over a wide range of bilateral disputes and
where the Clinton Administration is seen to be less seriously committed to
the Uruguay Round than its predecessor.
In this fracas, the US threatened sanctions when the EC put into effect a
new community-wide utilities directive, in January. It gives a 3 per cent
price preference to bids on telecom and electric power equipment from EC
firms.
The US had hoped for gains for its telecommunications companies in the EC
market. They are seen as part of the vanguard of particularly competitive US
industries, and the Administration is determined to take a strong stand.
The sanctions will hit EC companies whose products are not covered by the
multilateral government procurement code - telecommunications, airports,
power equipment, waterways and services. The US estimates that those
contracts were worth Dollars 40-50m in 1991.
The EC has argued that AT&amp;T ought to be subject to the same disciplines as
EC companies, even though most are government owned. The US refused saying
it will not interfere with a private entity.
Mr Kantor yesterday denied Japanese charges that US semiconductor
manufacturers had cancelled orders from Japan thus defeating Japanese
efforts to increase chip imports.
The charges have inflamed the decade-long semidispute.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Australian poll too close to call
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE outcome of today's Australian federal election remained in doubt
yesterday with polls showing sharp regional variations in support for the
two main parties.
The Labor government is likely to lose seats to the conservative
Liberal/National coalition in Western Australia, South Australia and
Queensland, but could make gains in Victoria and Tasmania.
'It is too close to call. The different trends in different states mean the
final outcome could be very close,' said Mr Sol Lebovic, director of the
Newspoll organisation.
Mr Gary Morgan, another leading pollster, said support for the government
had increased substantially following attacks on the coalition's proposals
for a goods and services tax (GST).
'The issue is the economic mess the country is in, and the concern is the
GST. If there was no GST the coalition would walk in,' he said. 'Labor must
be the underdog but they still can win it.'
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, and Mr John Hewson, the conservative
leader, both forecast a narrow victory for their own side. However,
confidence appeared to be higher in the conservative camp.
The coalition was encouraged by a last-minute vote of confidence from all
but one of Australia's main newspapers, which have frequently criticised
opposition policies during the campaign.
The Australian, owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, said the
coalition was 'the best option' for economic reform, in spite of 'deep
reservations' about some policies.
The coalition needs a net gain of five seats to win a majority in the
147-seat House of Representatives, which would be achieved by a uniform
national swing of 0.9 per cent.
If the election is close, the result may not be known until next week
because of the time required to count second and subsequent preferences
under Australia's voting system.
A dead heat is also possible because of the postponement of the election in
the marginal Queensland constituency of Dickson, following the death of one
of the candidates. The Dickson poll will be held next month.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Wholesale prices rise by 0.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHOLESALE prices in the US rose by 0.4 per cent in February compared with
January, the largest monthly increase in more than two years but not
necessarily a harbinger of new inflationary pressures.
Behind the increase in the producer price index - double the 0.2 per cent
advance of January - were more expensive home heating oil, petrol, tobacco
and new cars. Overall, the energy component of the index went up by 1.7 per
cent.
Food prices, on the other hand, were generally slightly lower, with bigger
falls recorded for a wide range of fruit and vegetables. Prices for finished
goods other than food and energy, both subject to greater volatility, rose
by 0.3 per cent in the month, under the 0.4 per cent increase of January.
Consumer prices in January rose by 0.5 per cent. The February report is due
out next Wednesday and will be keenly watched for any evidence of an
inflationary trend taking hold as the economy continues its recovery.
However, the consensus economic view, reinforced by the congressional
testimony of the 12 regional presidents of the Federal Reserve system on
Wednesday, remains one of relative price stability this year, though with
some increases in view next year.
Meanwhile the Senate budget committee on Thursday night approved a
resolution with more ambitious deficit reduction targets than proposed by
President Bill Clinton.
More significant than the numbers, at this stage only notional guidelines
since no actual programme cuts have been considered by Congress, is the fact
that Democrats on the committee held the line in turning down no fewer than
34 Republican amendments.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Liberal judge to quit supreme court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUSTICE Harry Blackmun, one of the two most liberal members of the US
Supreme Court, has said he expects to retire soon.
The 84-year-old Nixon appointee also announced that he thought Justice Byron
White, the only Democratic appointee on the court but now one of its more
conservative voices, might also soon quit. Last week the Washington Post
reported that Justice White had hired no new office interns for the term
beginning after the summer.
Justice Blackmun and Justice John Paul Stevens, named by President Ford,
have operated to great effect in a court intended by Presidents Reagan and
Bush to acquire a more conservative mould. Their judicial alliances with
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, David Souter and Anthony Kennedy, three swing
votes who have sometimes confounded conservative expectations, have often
frustrated the doctrinaire right wing judicial agenda on issues like
abortion.
If the two justices retire, President Bill Clinton would be the first
Democrat to make Supreme Court nominations since President John Kennedy
appointed Justice White in 1962.
Other departures are possible, but Justice Blackmun said that unless Mr
Clinton won a second term, when more vacancies might occur, he thought
conservative predominance on the Supreme Court could last until the next
century.
Mr Clinton is unlikely to find a judge more progressive than Justice
Blackmun, though Justice White has more often than not voted with court
conservatives. Mr Mario Cuomo, the governor of New York, is among those
regularly mentioned as a possible Clinton nomination.

<TEXT>
NORTH KOREA yesterday raised fears of an international confrontation over
its suspected nuclear weapons programme by declaring that it was withdrawing
from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
The decision caused consternation among its Asian neighbours and in the
West. North Korea would be the first country to scrap membership of the
treaty, which seeks to limit the spread of nuclear technology.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, threatened North Korea
yesterday with possible international sanctions. Asked if the US would push
for United Nations sanctions against North Korea, he said: 'Certainly the
North Korean situation is a serious one today and if they continue on the
path that they are on I think that that will have to be considered.'
Japan, Germany and Britain also urged Pyongyang to reconsider the move,
which Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, described as 'really
dismaying'. Ms Madeleine Albright, US ambassador to the United Nations,
said: 'We call upon North Korea to withdraw its declaration immediately.'
The decision would halt inspections by the International Atomic Energy
Agency, which has carried out six inspections of North Korean facilities
since Pyongyang permitted them last year.
The Vienna-based body said it was a 'grave step' and began preparations for
an emergency board session next week to discuss a response.
The IAEA had given a deadline of March 25 for the government of Mr Kim
Il-sung, a communist dictator, to permit inspections of two storage
buildings at Yongbyon, North Korea's nuclear complex. It suspects the sites
are being used to store nuclear waste for re-processing of plutonium.
However, Pyongyang responded that this was not possible at present because
of the annual US/South Korean 'Team Spirit' military exercises, now under
way. This week it placed the country on a 'semi-war' footing in response to
the exercise, which was suspended last year in a goodwill gesture after the
two Koreas signed a non-nuclear pact.
North Korea insists that the two sites are non-nuclear military
installations of no concern to IAEA inspectors.
In Seoul, where the cabinet met in emergency session, the South Korean
foreign ministry said: 'The North's professed reasons for pulling out of the
treaty convince no one. This only heightens the suspicion that it is
developing nuclear arms.'
The move threatened to undo recent progress in developing inter-Korean
relations.
Expiry of the IAEA March 25 deadline could see the issue being transferred
to the UN Security Council, which could impose sanctions for non-compliance.
China, a permanent member of the Security Council and one of North Korea's
few remaining allies, issued a mild rebuke to North Korea. Behind its
careful diplomatic phrasing, Beijing has had increasingly strained relations
with Pyongyang and is likely to be exasperated by its behaviour.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Pyongyang digs in over weaponry: John Burton reports on
North Korea's increasing isolation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons programme, which
appeared to be approaching a resolution a few months ago, has become
contentious again following Pyongyang's announcement yesterday that it is
withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
North Korea is believed to have started its nuclear research project in the
mid-1960s as part of the juche (self-reliance) ideology of President Kim
Il-sung to create an independent defence capability. The North Korean leader
worried that he could no longer rely on Soviet military backing, after the
fiasco of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, if a second Korean war broke out.
It was similar concerns about US military commitment to South Korea in the
1970s that persuaded Seoul to try to develop a nuclear weapon, although the
programme was eventually abandoned under US pressure.
Mr Tai Sung An, a respected US-based analyst of North Korea, argues that the
country is seeking several objectives in its nuclear weapons programme. They
include improving its negotiating leverage with South Korea and its allies,
the US and Japan, and 'offsetting its looming loss of conventional military
superiority relative to South Korea by building a nuclear strategic
equaliser.'
Mr Kim Il-sung has developed a paranoid fear of nuclear attack from the US
ever since that option was discussed during the Korean war 40 year ago, he
says. The main goal of the North Korean nuclear programme is 'to deter
nuclear attack from the United States by developing a local balance of
nuclear terror on the Korean peninsula.'
As North Korea became increasingly isolated from its Russian and Chinese
allies in the post-cold war period, it has expanded its facilities at the
Yongbyon nuclear complex, 60 miles from Pyongyang, in an apparently
accelerated effort to acquire a nuclear weapon.
It operates two small reactors at the site and is building a bigger
50-megawatt unit. It is also constructing what appears to be a large nuclear
fuel reprocessing plant to extract weapons-grade plutonium from the spent
nuclear fuel generated from the reactors.
However, there were also indications that Pyongyang realised its nuclear
weapons programme was proving counterproductive as its economy deteriorated.
Its need for foreign investment from South Korea, the US and Japan to revive
the economy led it to make apparent concessions on the nuclear issue to
reduce suspicions blocking ties with these countries.
It signed a non-nuclear pact with South Korea in late 1991 and agreed to
allow scheduled inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency last
spring in belated compliance with its signing of the treaty in 1985.
But progress became bogged down after Seoul wanted to conduct challenge
inspections of suspected but undisclosed nuclear facilities, while the IAEA
demanded last month a special inspection of two buildings in the Yongbyon
complex that it believed contained plutonium. The IAEA request pushed
Pyongyang towards renouncing the treaty.
The obvious conclusion to draw from Pyongyang's action is that it has
accumulated plutonium and feared that the IAEA would discover it. The US and
Japanese governments claim that North Korea has already stockpiled enough
plutonium to make at least one or two nuclear bombs.
Japanese officials estimate that North Korea has extracted between 16kg and
24kg of weapons-grade plutonium.
But there are other explanations for North Korea's apparently rash response.
One is that the nuclear programme has become a key issue in power struggle
between hardliners and reformers in Pyongyang. While the reformers were in
the ascendant last year and successfully pushed for nuclear concessions in
return for foreign investment, the hardliners might be gaining power now.
There has also been speculation recently that Kim Il-sung is seriously ill,
which might have triggered a political fight.
Another explanation is that officials fear public discontent as the economy
collapses and are creating a crisis atmosphere about a US threat, in the
form of the current Team Spirit military exercise, to rally support behind
the regime.
Pyongyang's growing isolation from the outside world may be strengthening
its resolve to resist what it perceives as intrusions on its sovereignty,
which it accused the IAEA of doing with its inspection demands.
Russian and Chinese diplomats recently cited this reason in warning that the
West should not press North Korea too much on the nuclear issue and deny it
room for diplomatic manoeuvring and the ability to save face.

A FORMER political ally of the South Korean president was elected yesterday
as the leader of the country's main opposition Democratic Party, writes John
Burton in Seoul.
Mr Lee Ki-taek succeeds Mr Kim Dae-jung, who retired after being defeated in
the presidential election last December. Mr Lee's election follows a power
struggle within the party, which holds 97 of the 299 seats in the National
Assembly.
But it is still threatened with dissension and a possible break-up, which
could improve the parliamentary position of President Kim Young-sam's
government. Mr Lee represents a minority faction that joined the Democratic
Party in 1991. The party is dominated by followers of Mr Kim Dae-jung who
mainly come from the south-western Cholla region which historically has been
at odds with the central government in Seoul.
Mr Lee was a member of President Kim's former opposition party. When Mr Kim
decided to merge his party with the government in 1990, Mr Lee stayed in
opposition, joining the Democratic Party a year later.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Japan grows by 1.5% in 1992

JAPAN'S economy grew by 1.5 per cent last year, the slowest rate of growth
in 18 years, after domestic demand continued to weaken in the final quarter.
The news prompted further calls yesterday for an emergency economic package.
Much of the growth for the year was generated by an increase in exports, as
the slim 0.1 per cent expansion in the October to December quarter came in
spite of a 0.5 per cent contraction in personal consumption and private
investment.
But the annualised 0.5 per cent growth during the final quarter did prevent
Japan from experiencing a second quarter of negative growth, and thus
falling technically into recession. The economy contracted by 2.4 per cent
during the third quarter, the first such decline in three years.
The Economic Planning Agency conceded yesterday Japan was unlikely to reach
its official target of 1.6 per cent growth for the fiscal year which ends
this month, and hinted further stimulation would be needed if the target of
3.3 per cent growth next year was to be met.
Japan is under pressure from trading partners to meet these goals, as
sluggish domestic demand is blamed for the country's surging trade surplus.
Exports are continuing to increase by 2 to 3 per cent each month, while
imports are falling by an average 6 per cent.
It is likely the country would have slipped into recession without a boost
to public spending during the final quarter, when a Y10,700bn (Pounds 62bn)
government package began to take effect. During the same period, private
non-residential investment was 3.1 per cent lower, reflecting cuts in
capital spending.
The weakness of private consumption and a continuing increase in personal
savings have fuelled debate within the government over whether tax cuts are
needed to encourage consumers to spend. The government is also considering
incentives for home buyers and a new package of infrastructure spending.
Mr Kenneth Courtis, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Asia,
suggested Japanese contractors 'can't dig ditches or build bridges fast
enough'.
'If you look at the figures, Japan has been exporting its way out of
recession, and something more must be done to stimulate domestic demand,' Mr
Courtis said.

MR Rajan Pillai, a Singapore-based businessman nicknamed the 'Biscuit King'
for his processed food empire, has been charged in court with offences under
the local companies act, Reuter reports from Singapore.
Mr Pillai, 45, chairman of Singapore's Britannia Industries, pleaded not
guilty. He was arrested on Wednesday and charged with having illegally
authorised loans from Britannia to companies in which he had significant
stakes to help them acquire Britannia shares.
He was released on bail of SDollars 500,000 (Pounds 214,788) after
Thursday's hearing. A commercial affairs department official said his
passport had been impounded.
Britannia is a holding company for several subsidiaries incorporated in
India, Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Britain.
They manufacture and market branded biscuits, cereals and other food.
Britannia's turnover in 1992 was more than Dollars 700m.
Mr Pillai is charged with sanctioning SDollars 10.68m in loans in November
1989 to a Liberian-incorporated company, Pacific Talon, to help it acquire
Britannia shares. In December 1990, he is alleged to have lent SDollars
11.25m to Pacific to help it acquire more Britannia shares. Mr Pillai has a
large stake in Pacific, the official said.
The offences are punishable with up to three years' jail or a SDollars
20,000 fine or both.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Mediators fail to sway Milosevic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIA peace mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen last night left a
meeting in Paris with Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, with no
more than vague assurances that he will use his influence to back their
peace plan.
After a meeting hosted by President Francois Mitterrand of France, followed
by a dinner at the French Foreign Ministry, Lord Owen and Mr Vance expressed
their habitual public optimism that the peace talks in New York were about
to enter a more positive phase. It had been a good meeting and 'some
progress' was made, they said.
However, apart from extracting a promise from Mr Milosevic that he would do
his best to persuade the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, to attend
the peace talks in New York next week, the mediators do not appear to have
won any concrete commitments from the Serbian president. Indeed, he stressed
after the first meeting with the mediators and Mr Mitterrand that he had no
direct part to play in the peace negotiations. It was up to the warring
parties to work out an agreement on the controversial map dividing Bosnia
into 10 provinces.
Mr Milosevic's attempt to stand aside from the peace negotiations was not at
all to the taste of the mediators, who had engineered the Paris meeting with
the express objective of persuading Mr Milosevic to put pressure on Mr
Karadzic.
Mr Mitterrand brandished both the carrot and the stick in his approach to
the Serbian president. Though he gave a magisterial outline of Serbia's
historical role in Europe, this was offset by his clear warning that,
whatever the rights and wrongs of the situation in Bosnia, the international
community was determined to take action against Belgrade (in the form of
tighter sanctions) if the Serbs did nothing to help end the conflict in
Bosnia.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen have returned to New York breathing confidence that
their negotiations will resume next week, but on past experience, they
cannot be sure that either Mr Karadzic or Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem
Bosnian president, will turn up.
However, even if both attend the talks in New York, unless Mr Milosevic is
prepared to play the ace that he undoubtedly holds, the prospects for peace
must still be gloomy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE entire German political establishment was locked away behind the closed
doors of the chancellor's office in Bonn yesterday, searching for signs of
daylight in the fine detail of their 'solidarity pact' for east Germany,
Quentin Peel writes from Bonn.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with a string of top government ministers, the main
parliamentary party leaders, the 16 prime ministers of the federal states,
and their finance ministers and advisers, agreed to carry on negotiating in
working groups all evening, and meet again today, in an attempt to forge the
political consensus they have been seeking since last September.
A formula has to be found to finance a spending gap of DM110bn (Pounds
46.6bn) in 1995 to pour more money into the collapsed eastern economy.
The signs last night were that there was clear movement towards a political
compromise, although the final figures - at least on the burden sharing -
may take a little longer to agree. The opposition Social Democrats have won
the first battle to block any big social spending cuts.
Instead, they have agreed on a campaign to stop unemployment and social
security swindles, and to identify further savings of more than DM3bn in
other parts of the budget.
The other main move was a concession to the new states of east Germany for
the government to shoulder a share of their DM51bn housing debt.

which is expected to urge speedier economic liberalisation and further
entrench reformists in power, Tony Walker writes from Beijing.
Gen Wang, 84 and a veteran of the Communists' 'Long March', was vice
president, a largely ceremonial role. However, he remained active behind the
scenes, and until quite recently was opposing what he considered hasty
liberalisation.

The European Community should develop a co-ordinated approach to advanced
television technology, based on wide-screen broadcasts and a 'family' of
digital television transmission standards, the European Commission said
yesterday, reports Andrew Hill from Brussels.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, and Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro,
responsible for audiovisual policy, said a common approach to digital
standardisation was the best way to 'reduce the risk of market fragmentation
which a haphazard unco-ordinated approach could bring'.
But industry analysts warned yesterday that the Community risked repeating
the errors of its original ill-fated HDTV strategy. This was based on a
family of analogue standards, and was criticised for being driven by
technology rather than consumer needs.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Italy's export credit agency chief arrested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian treasury has assured Sace, the country's state-run export credit
guarantee agency, that it will continue to operate normally despite the
arrest of Mr Roberto Ruberti, its chief executive, on charges of corruption.
Mr Ruberti was arrested on Thursday and five other key figures connected
with Sace activities were warned by Rome magistrates they were under
investigation.
These included Mr Vincenzo Martinez, the deputy chairman, Mr Giuseppe Mazza,
director general of the Commerce Ministry and head of Sace's management
committee, and Mr Roberto Bonfigli, an indemnities department executive.
According to Rome magistrates, Mr Ruberti is alleged to have received
payment in return for providing insurance cover for overseas Italian
contracting operations.
Sace, which was established in 1977, last year was providing credit
guarantees for exports totalling L150,000bn (Pounds 68bn). Since its
inception it has paid out indemnities totalling L9,597bn.
The management committee is composed of representatives of the treasury,
foreign and commerce ministries, INA, the state insurance institute, and
Mediocredito, the state credit institute.
Separately in Milan, police arrested Mr Pompeo Locatelli, the well-known
financial consultant who played a decisive role advising the Eni state
energy and chemicals group over the Enimont chemicals joint venture with
Montedison in its final days.
He is accused of accepting stolen funds and illegal financing of political
parties. The arrest follows allegations made by Mr Pier Francesco Pacini
Battaglia, a Geneva-based Italian banker, who testified before magistrates
earlier this week.
The allegations are said to relate to L3bn in illegal financing for the
Socialist party, made in conjunction with Mr Silvano Larini, the playboy
Socialist architect who gave himself up last month.
Mr Locatelli sprang to public notice in late 1990, when he was one of the
main advisers to Eni in the negotiations over the future of Enimont. Many
observers ascribe to him the complex procedure under which Eni and the
Montedison chemicals group, the two warring partners in the joint venture,
agreed for one to buy out the other.
That transaction, and other aspects of Enimont's affairs, are now under
scrutiny in a separate strand to the current corruption investigations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Portugal intervened heavily to defend the escudo yesterday after
Mr Antonio Borges, its deputy governor, resigned in a rift with the
government over monetary policy.
The escudo fell to a record low of DM94 before central bank buying pushed
the currency back up to about DM92.75. The stock market also reacted to the
uncertainties raised by Mr Borges' resignation with the the Bolsa de Valores
de Lisboa index falling 1.15 per cent on the day.
Mr Borges resigned on Thursday night in reaction to a speech by Mr Jorge
Braga de Macedo, finance minister, in which he criticised the central bank
for failing to heed the needs of the real economy and lower interest rates.
Rumours were rife in financial markets yesterday that Mr Miguel Beleza,
governor of the Bank of Portugal, might also resign unless he could secure a
guarantee from Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, that the central bank
would have full freedom to conduct exchange rate and monetary policy as it
saw fit.
The divide between the government and the central bank on interest rates has
been growing for several weeks. Mr Borges, responsible for exchange rate
control, believes the escudo should be kept strong and interest rates should
only be allowed to fall as inflation comes down.
He has warned this would mean heavy casualties, particularly among small and
medium-sized companies, but was necessary to make the economy competitive
and ensure the transfer of resources to efficient companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday unveiled a DM15bn (Pounds 6.3bn) clean-up
budget, aimed in part to attract foreign investors, for one of eastern
Germany's most polluted regions.
The federal government, through the Treuhandanstalt, the agency responsible
for the privatisation of the eastern German economy, will provide up to
DM15bn over the next five years.
'Germany has to carry the environmental burden, not the investor,' the
Treuhandanstalt said yesterday, but added that the technical details about
raising the money had yet to be decided.
In principle, the federal government has agreed to provide 75 per cent of
the costs, while the state which is home to the pollution must meet the
remaining quarter.
'The point is that no foreign investor is going to come and buy the large
chemical industries or mining sector if they know they have to carry the
clean-up bill as well,' the an Environmental Ministry official said.
The budget is earmarked for the triangle linking Halle, Leipzig and
Bitterfeld, former centres of the chemical and lignite mining areas. These
enterprises, each employing thousands of workers, remain under the control
of the Treuhand. The agency's ability to sell them may be increased
following this massive injection of capital.

BRITISH troops reached safety yesterday after spending 24 hours blockaded in
a Moslem-held Bosnian village, the British army said, Reuter reports from
Banja Koviljaca.
Eleven British soldiers and World Health Organisation doctor Simon Mardel,
who is also British, arrived in the Serbian town of Banja Koviljaca, several
hours after leaving the besieged Moslem village of Konjevic Polje.
The British went to Konjevic Polje on Thursday to act as an escort for a
United Nations convoy sent to pick up people wounded in the fighting.
They had initially been prevented from leaving by crowds of women and
children who wanted to make sure that all the wounded were evacuated, not
just wounded women and children as stipulated by the Serbs.
Military spokesman Major Martin Waters said their officer had decided to
pull out because their presence was attracting shellfire which was
endangering the civilian population.
Shelling by Serbs killed and wounded a number of women and young children
who were blockading the British soldiers.
Major Waters said two doctors had performed operations on the victims
without the use of anaesthetic. 'There are quite a few dead, and six
children under five were seriously injured, two with their legs blown off.'
he said.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Yeltsin's deputy seeks help from G7 in Hong Kong: The west
ponders how to initiate the tight economic policies needed to ensure aid to
Russia is not wasted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FLURRY of nervous behind-the-scenes diplomatic activity was under way last
night as Mr Boris Fyodorov, a Russian deputy prime minister, flew to Hong
Kong for an unprecedented meeting with officials of the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations.
In spite of broad public declarations of support for President Boris Yeltsin
in recent days, the G7 nations have stopped short of offering unconditional
backing for him.
Instead, a senior British diplomat said in London that the G7 would only
draw conclusions at the end of the two-day Hong Kong meeting, when it was
hoped political developments in Moscow had become clearer. 'It is an
extremely serious situation,' he said.
The G7 meeting was due to look at ways the industrial powers can maintain
the reform process in Russia, including the question of further economic
aid. But as the showdown between Mr Yeltsin and the Congress of People's
Deputies has come to a climax, the agenda is certain to have taken on a more
overtly political tone.
Both France and Germany have indicated that they favour an emergency G7
heads of government meeting, to be convened before the scheduled Tokyo
summit in July. However, with the balance of power between Mr Yeltsin and
the Congress still uncertain, the US and the UK remain cautious.
A more likely outcome will be a meeting of G7 finance and, possibly, foreign
ministers to assess the outlook. That could be convened at short notice in
order for its work to be completed before Mr Yeltsin's scheduled meeting
with President Bill Clinton in Vancouver on April 3-4.
Despite a call from Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French premier, on Thursday for
more US and Japanese financial aid for Russia, many diplomats believe that
economic support will have little bearing on what is now essentially a
political power struggle.
As President Boris Yeltsin's political troubles help focus western minds on
the need to accelerate assistance for his economic reforms, the question of
how to deliver help becomes more urgent than ever.
One reason why the west has not produced large-scale finance for Russian
economic reform is because of doubts that it would achieve its purpose. The
banking and distribution systems are extremely primitive, capital flight and
corruption are big problems, and the bureaucracy is slow and inept.
Even Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister for economics and finance
who arrives in Hong Kong today for talks with the Group of Seven countries,
agrees that stopping aid from being wasted is the biggest headache. Without
tight economic policies, all would be lost.
The stakes are high. If the aid does not reach its targets, the risk of a
political backlash against reform in Russia is heightened. If aid is not
controlled, it might just provide a financial cushion to delay reform.
There is also pressure for aid to go beyond new loans. Much of the Dollars
24bn (Pounds 17bn) package promised by the west last year was limited to
loans guaranteed by western governments for imports of western goods and
equipment. A new emphasis would target western cash at projects to show
concrete benefits and even help Russia generate hard currency.
The World Bank would lead such efforts, which include, for example, a plan
to finance equipment to cap gas flares in Russia's oil industry.
This thinking is even being applied to the International Monetary Fund, last
year charged with administering western financial assistance to Russia in
return for reforms which never materialised.
Diplomats say the G7 is now considering the creation of a special fund, to
be run by the IMF, to finance specific programmes. One - approved by the
Russian premier, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin - would organise five model
bankruptcies in key sectors. This would warn enterprises squandering state
support and instruct officials and judges on how to implement Russia's first
bankruptcy law in 70 years.
Another idea is for the IMF to take on the burden of subsidies at present
provided by Moscow to the former Soviet republics through the issue of
credits from the Russian Central Bank. Mr Fyodorov says that last year
Russia spent the equivalent of Dollars 18bn subsidising the former
republics.
Technical assistance might also draw more on examples which have worked well
so far. One model is the work of the International Finance Corporation, the
World Bank's private sector development arm, which is working in the
provinces to help local authorities privatise shops, big enterprises, and
even land.
Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, who last year headed a government commission to fight
corruption until it was disbanded, suggests that plants equipped with
western machinery but not completed under inefficient state management
should simply be given to western companies. Completed and run by
westerners, they would provide models of efficiency and jobs.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Lisbon intervenes to defend escudo: Resignation of Bank
deputy puts pressure on currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BANK of Portugal intervened heavily to defend the escudo yesterday after
Mr Antonio Borges, its deputy governor, resigned in a rift with the
government over monetary policy.
The escudo fell to a record low of DM94 before central bank buying pushed
the currency back up to about DM92.75. The stock market also reacted to the
uncertainties raised by Mr Borges' resignation with the the Bolsa de Valores
de Lisboa index falling 1.15 per cent on the day.
Mr Jose Fonseca Goncalves, an analyst with Totta Dealer, said: 'Mr Borges
was someone they could depend on for a firm policy line. Now nobody is sure
what to expect.'
Mr Borges resigned on Thursday night in reaction to a speech by Mr Jorge
Braga de Macedo, finance minister, in which he criticised the central bank
for failing to heed the needs of the real economy and lower interest rates.
Rumours were rife in financial markets yesterday that Mr Miguel Beleza,
governor of the Bank of Portugal, might also resign unless he could secure a
guarantee from Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, that the central bank
would have full freedom to conduct exchange rate and monetary policy as it
saw fit.
The divide between the government and the central bank on interest rates has
been growing for several weeks. Mr Borges, responsible for exchange rate
control, believes that the escudo should be kept strong and interest rates
should only be allowed to fall as inflation comes down.
He has warned that this would mean heavy casualties, particularly among
small and medium-sized companies that make up the bulk of Portuguese
industry. But, he argued, it was a necessary step to make the economy more
competitive and ensure the transfer of resources to efficient firms.
Mr Braga de Macedo, under pressure from export companies caught between the
high cost of money and the strength of the escudo, favours a more rapid
descent of interest rates.
Interest rates have been falling steadily in Portugal as inflation came down
from 11.4 per cent in 1991 to 8.9 per cent in 1992.
But there remains a wide difference between prime rates offered to the best
companies and the much higher rates available to small companies.
The central bank has been regularly drawing from massive foreign exchange
reserves to defend the escudo. But it took the unusual step yesterday of
publically acknowledging heavy intervention.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Tough times on catwalk leave designers struggling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST Paris ready-to-wear fashion collections kicked off in the Louvre
yesterday against a drab economic backdrop and a row among the leading
designers which threatens to split the French fashion industry.
The Paris designers, which flourished in the buoyant 1980s, are now
struggling in more competitive conditions.
Sales of French designer fashions have fallen sharply since the peak of
FFr5bn (Pounds 627m) in 1990 to just FFr4.3bn last year, according to the
Chambre Syndicale, which represents the industry.
This season the Paris fashion houses are hoping for an improvement in US
demand, but expect further problems with Japan. They also face the handicap
of the strong French franc, which makes it more difficult for them to
compete against the Milan and New York designers.
Yves Saint Laurent, one of the leading Paris houses, was forced this year to
sell out to Elf-Sanofi, the state-controlled French pharmaceuticals group.
Others, including Givenchy and Jean-Louis Scherrer, have shed staff.
Philippe Venet, an old established couture business, last month fired its
entire workforce.
This week's ready-to-wear collections have a subdued air. Yohji Yamamoto and
Commes des Garcons, the Japanese designers, are staging small shows instead
of their usual lavish events in the Louvre. Jean-Paul Gaultier, the French
designer known for his theatrical collections, is holding a small show in
his shop. Martin Margiela, leader of the younger avant garde, is not showing
at all.
Meanwhile the whole industry has been flung into chaos by a row between Mr
Pierre Berge, YSL's chairman, and the Chambre Syndicale. YSL last month
broke away from the Chambre Syndicale, which organises the Paris shows,
after Mr Berge was ousted as head of the ready-to-wear section.
Mr Berge is now trying to persuade other designers to join YSL in staging
their own shops under a new organisation.
If he succeeds, retail buyers and journalists would have to choose between
two separate sets of fashion shows possibly held on different dates, thereby
weakening Paris' position as the centre of international fashion.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Conservatives move up, ecologists fall back in French poll

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH a week to go before the first round of voting in France's parliamentary
election, the conservative coalition is still gaining ground over the ruling
Socialists in the polls.
The Socialists now command the support of 18 per cent of the electorate,
according to a BVA poll in today's Liberation newspaper. This leaves the
ruling party behind both centre-right parties.
The RPR is edging ahead of the UDF, with 20 per cent to 19 per cent.
Meanwhile the ecologists, who earlier in the campaign threatened to beat the
Socialists into second place, are now losing momentum. Support for the
ecologist alliance has slipped to 12 per cent from 14.5 per cent a month
ago.
The new poll suggests the RPR will emerge as the largest single force in the
National Assembly, with 228 seats, against 198 for the UDF. This should give
the RPR an advantage in the allocation of ministerial positions and possibly
influence President Francois Mitterrand in his choice of prime minister.
The president was yesterday embroiled in controversy over allegations by
Liberation newspaper that his security staff at the Elysee Palace had in the
mid-1980s made requests to bug the telephones of scores of prominent
figures, including the actress Ms Carole Bouquet and the writer Mr
Jean-Edern Hallier. Last week Liberation claimed that Elysee staff had
tapped the phone of Mr Edwy Plenel, an investigative journalist.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Yeltsin to test nation's allegiance: Threat of chaos and
'civil war'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday challenged Russia's conservative-dominated
parliament to a political duel for the allegiance of the country.
Facing further attempts to curtail his power, Mr Yeltsin walked out of the
Russian Congress of Peoples' Deputies to take his cause of a strengthened
presidency, economic reform and constitutional change to the people.
Both his supporters and enemies emphasised the risks being run by their
inability to compromise. Mr Sergei Shakrai, a deputy prime minister and a
close aide to Mr Yeltsin, said the Congress 'has led the country to a
threshold after which lies the road to revolution, chaos and the rule of the
street'.
Mr Sergei Baburin, a leader of the hardline nationalist Russian Unity group,
said that once the question of relative strength was posed between the
president and the parliament, 'then the state is on the verge of a civil
war'.
Concern in the west at events in Moscow was evident in remarks by President
Bill Clinton, who told reporters: 'I support democracy in Russia and the
movement to a market economy, and Boris Yeltsin is the elected president of
Russia.'
The Group of Seven leading industrial nations have, however, so far stopped
short of offering Mr Yeltsin unconditional backing. Mr Boris Fyodorov, a
deputy prime minister, flew to Hong Kong to meet G7 officials exploring ways
to maintain the reform process in Russia, including possible further
economic aid.
Fears over the growing crisis in Moscow also helped push share prices lower
across Europe and the US. At the Congress, when it became plain that
deputies would finally pass a resolution which reduces the presidential
office to one occupied on the sufferance of parliament, Mr Yeltsin took the
rostrum to say that their decision would create 'a power vacuum which would
weaken Russia'.
If his proposed amendments were not passed, said Mr Yeltsin, he would take
'additional measures to retain the power balance in the country'. In spite
of shouts of alarm, he - and later his aides - made clear that what he had
in mind was a referendum, to be held in April, on the supremacy of the
presidency and the private ownership of land.
Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the presidential press secretary, said Mr Yeltsin
'understands he has only one partner left with whom he can talk. This is the
people'. He is expected to address the nation on television today.
Mr Shakrai said the referendum was constitutionally valid. The president's
legal service holds that the original pact in December between president and
Congress to go to the people on the nature of the constitution cannot be
repealed. Congress, however, earlier this week unfroze an article of the
constitution which allows parliament to dismiss the president if it
considers he has acted unconstitutionally.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, said last night that
a meeting during the session between Mr Yeltsin, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
combative parliamentary speaker, and Mr Valery Zorkin, head of the
Constitutional Court, produced nothing more than an invitation from Mr
Khasbulatov for the president again to address the Congress.
Mr Khasbulatov commanded Congress to sit for a fourth day today because, he
said, 'we should watch most attentively how the executive branch of
government (Mr Yeltsin) observes the constitution'. On the agenda are the
proposed referendum and the possibility of early elections.
Congress or its smaller permanent body, the Supreme Soviet, must either now
respond to Mr Yeltsin's challenge by moving towards declaring his actions
unconstitutional - or attempt to seek an accord with him.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Pounds 900m plan for west coast rail upgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE of Britain's biggest engineering companies have proposed a Pounds 900m
scheme to raise private finance for much-needed improvements to the main
west coast railway line between London and Glasgow.
GEC Alsthom, Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty, the construction arm of
BICC, would recoup their costs by charging train operators a fee for using
the upgraded track.
The consortium would not own the track but would charge fees under a
concession which would run for an agreed number of years. This would be
similar to concessions granted to operators of the Channel tunnel and the
new toll bridge across the River Thames at Dartford.
The proposal has been submitted to Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary,
who is currently considering the privatisation of British Rail. The
government plans that track ownership would be transferred to a new
state-owned body called Railtrack. This would still leave the problem of how
to raise cash to pay for track, signalling and rolling stock improvements
when the government is trying to restrain growth in public-sector spending.
British Rail InterCity last year asked for punctuality standards, under the
Passenger's Charter, to be lowered on the 400-mile west coast main line
because lack of investment was making services unreliable.
Under the consortium's plan, private finance would be raised to pay for
track replacement, improved electrical and signalling systems, realignment
of some curved sections of track to allow faster train speeds, and
replacement of some bridges.
Included in the Pounds 900m bill is Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m for new rolling
stock to be provided by GEC Alsthom. The proposals include improved links
from the main line to Birmingham, Stoke-on-Trent, Liverpool and Manchester.
Balfour Beatty provided the overhead systems for the Pounds 515m public
sector electrification of the east coast main line between London and
Edinburgh. Trafalgar House is a member of the private sector consortium
which built the Dartford Bridge and a member of a consortium which has won a
concession to build a privately financed toll road around part of
Birmingham.
The government has been trying to encourage private sector investors to take
advantage of Treasury rule changes which should make it easier to raise
private finance for infrastructure projects.

FT  13 MAR 93 / Acquittals in car park spying trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDUSTRIAL espionage trial, involving National Car Parks, ended yesterday
with the acquittals of both defendants and calls for reform of the law
affecting the operation of private security companies.
After a two-month trial, Mr Gordon Layton, chief executive of NCP, the
leading car parks operator, and Mr Simon Hewitt, a former manager with KAS,
a now defunct security company, were acquitted of conspiring to defraud
rival Europarks.
The case has been regarded within the legal profession as the most important
example of industrial espionage to come before the courts and a test of
current legislation.
The Old Bailey jury heard how, at Mr Layton's request, KAS - the company
formed by the late Sir David Stirling, the founder of Britain's Special Air
Service - carried out a three-year espionage operation against Europarks to
acquire confidential information.
The methods included surveillance of directors, searches of offices and the
infiltration of 'moles' into the rival company.
The two defendants argued they thought the operation was inside the law and
had not been intended to damage Europarks.
After their acquittals, Judge Richard Hawkins turned down applications from
both men for their costs to be met from public funds. Lawyers for Mr Layton
said: 'The fact that the trial took place at all has shown the law relating
to private security services to be in a very unsatisfactory state and in
need of clarification.'
NCP had remained confident of Mr Layton's innocence and he would now return
to his work as chief executive, they said.
After the verdicts, the prosecution dropped charges against two others
involved in the espionage operation - Mr Ian Crooke, a former SAS colonel
and KAS manager, and Ms Jane Turpin, a former Army captain who had
infiltrated Europarks for KAS.

The New Zealand government sold Telecom NZ to the local subsidiaries of two
US telecommunications companies, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech, in 1990, with
the requirement that they should reduce their joint holding to under 50 per
cent by September 1994 (recently extended from September 1993).
BZW is distributing the shares to investors in Europe and elsewhere, in
conjunction with ABN Amro and Caisse des Depots.
Nomura Securities will open a branch in the Japanese city of Akashi, Reuter

Talk of sluggish demand and fierce competition continued to drag on the
drinks sector, with investors shunning domestic stocks and turning to Grand
Metropolitan, where analysts have returned from recent meetings with an
upbeat message. The US vegetable business has begun to recover, and with
half its profits earned in dollars the group is also a big beneficiary of
recent currency movements. Analysts also pointed out Grand Met's low
exposure to the weak Scotch market and the upturn in its own drinks
business. The shares added 8 to 479p in turnover of 3.9m.
Bass continued to suffer a hangover from the recent spate of downgrades and
the shares slipped 8 to 575p, dragging with it Whitbread 'A', off 4 at 477p.
Turnover in BTR soared to 10m after the company cheered the market with 1992
results that topped the Pounds 1bn mark for the first time. Profits at the
international conglomerate improved by 18 per cent to Pounds 1.085bn and
investors are to receive a higher than anticipated final dividend.
The shares jumped 25 to 612p as brokers moved to upgrade current year profit
estimates. The range of predictions for this year's profits is between
Pounds 1.25bn and Pounds 1.28bn, with BZW top of the range on Pounds 1.30bn.
Preliminary results from Enterprise Oil proved a disappointment to the
market with the increase in the dividend fully expected. A number of
specialists expressed concern over the group's exploration record during
1992 and said the company's 'finding costs' had risen sharply. Enterprise
shares closed 10 down at 497p.
The rest of the oil sector found it hard to make any fresh progress,
reacting to the slide in crude oil prices, where April Brent dipped below
Dollars 19 a barrel, amid worries that Kuwait may leave Opec.
Lasmo endured more sustained selling pressure, the shares slipping a further
6 to 181p with dealers openly speculating about the likelihood of a cut in
the dividend when the preliminary figures are published on March 24.
Standard Chartered, which powered to a five and a half-year high after
revealing preliminary figures on Wednesday, gave up 13 to 703p.
Refuge was the pick of the life sector, the shares advancing 26 to 1020p
after the much better than expected 8.6 per cent rise in the dividend.
Britannic, which has a 9 per cent stake in Refuge, climbed 20 to 1270p.
Willis Corroon raced up 18 to 208p with First Boston, the US investment
bank, said to have been an aggressive buyer of the stock.
A small number of brokers, notably Kleinwort Benson, were said to have
turned more positive on Dixons, with the Silo subsidiary in the US the focus
of attention. The shares gained 4 to 235p.
Marks and Spencer continued to attract investors attention on the back of
its low historic rating and rumours of good sales. The shares rose 7 to 359p
in chunky turnover of 7.8m.
Covering of positions by one marketmaker squeezed Iceland Frozen Foods up 23
at one stage, before slipping to close 15 ahead at 738p.
A buy recommendation from Lehman brothers coupled with an upgrading of
profit expectations from NatWest Securities boosted BAA and the shares ended
7 better at 800p.
Shares in Rolls-Royce had a volatile session as the company reported
results. They fell initially as the market reacted to a loss of Pounds 184m,
far greater than anticipated, but including an exceptional charge of Pounds
268m. This was however later taken by the market to be a positive
restructuring move that should benefit the company and taken with the lower
than anticipated dividend cut, helped the shares rally to close a net 2 1/2
better at 131 1/2 p, in hefty trade of 17m. Mr Keith Hodgkinson at Lehman
Brothers - who said 'it looks like the company has actually got to grips
with the problems' - is predicting profits for this year of Pounds 115m. Mr
Clive Forrestier-Walker at Charter House Tilney is more cautious and has
penciled in Pounds 95m for 1993 profits.
Elsewhere in the sector, the improved dividend at TI Group as it reported
figures helped the shares add 6 to 316p.
Amstrad jumped 4 1/4 to 35 1/2 p on turnover of 20m shares, the heaviest
since July last year, after news that it will launch a 'personal digital
assistant' computer in London next week.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: SIP to expand capital by L736bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIP, Italy's main telephone utility, yesterday announced a rights issue of
up to L736bn (Dollars 494m), undeterred by a drop in profits to L460.6bn in
1992 from L486.4bn in 1991.
The capital increase, on the basis of 13 new ordinary shares at L1,200 each
for every 100 ordinary or savings shares held, provoked mixed feelings among
analysts. Although widely discounted in the market, the latest increase
follows a string of money-raising exercises by Italy's state-controlled
telecoms groups.
'We don't think it's that all bad,' said one dealer. 'The trouble is, the
amount is relatively small, leading to fears that SIP may be planning
another capital increase soon'. SIP shares, which closed at L1,660 in Milan,
before the deal was announced, slipped by L10 on London's SEAQ system.
Group turnover rose by 10.8 per cent to L21,557bn, while gross earnings
jumped by 36.8 per cent to L998.2bn. The dividend remained unchanged at L75
for ordinary shares and L95 for savings stock.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Setback for General Motors as Lopez resigns key position
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors yesterday suffered a severe setback in its efforts to return
its North American automobile operations to profit, when Mr J. Ignacio Lopez
de Arriortua, head of worldwide purchasing, resigned amid reports he is
joining Volkswagen.
Mr Lopez, who was appointed to the purchasing job only 10 months ago, has
been the key person in a drive by GM to cut costs through a radical
reorganisation in the way it buys parts in North America.
GM's announcement did not spell out where Mr Lopez was going, but reports
from Germany have repeatedly suggested he was joining Volkswagen on March
16, when the company is due to announce sweeping changes in management. Mr
Lopez repeatedly denied this, insisting he was happy at GM.
Mr Lopez, a Spaniard, has a deep knowledge of the European motor industry,
having played a crucial role in the 1980s in turning GM's European
operations from loss to profit. As head of European purchasing, he slashed
the company's costs and improved quality by renegotiating supplier
contracts.
He was brought to the US by Mr Jack Smith, GM's chief executive, last May to
do the same thing in North America. He stirred up immense opposition from
some of GM's parts suppliers, who accused him of demanding unrealistic
improvements in what they claimed were good productivity records and thin
profit margins.
Mr Smith yesterday expressed confidence that the worldwide purchasing team
assembled by Mr Lopez would 'keep the momentum going and meet our aggressive
approach for improved material quality and service, while achieving our
commitments for total material cost savings.'
Analysts said the costs drive was so much a product of Mr Lopez's personal
management style that it was bound to suffer from his departure. GM is
understood to be close to assembling the world's largest ever bank credit
line, totalling nearly Dollars 25bn, to refinance maturing bank lines,
particularly at its finance arm, General Motors Acceptance Corp.
The facility, lead-managed by Chemical Banking, would involve more than
Dollars 20bn in syndicated credits, with about Dollars 4bn more from
individual banks.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Canadian steel makers in
mini-mill plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO CANADIAN steel producers are joining forces to build a 2m tons-per-year
mini-mill in the US.
Dofasco, Canada's biggest integrated steelmaker, and Co-Steel, which
specialises in mini-mill production, said the first phase of the project,
with a production of 1m tons of flat-rolled hot band a year, would come on
stream in early 1995 at a cost of USDollars 300m. The second phase is
expected to begin in 1997 at 'relatively modest additional capital cost'.
The location of the mill has not been decided, but the choice has narrowed
to sites in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. The companies said the
selection would be influenced by electric power costs and infrastructure
requirements.
Mr John Mayberry, Dofasco chief executive, said the new mill would compete
with the world's lowest cost producers. It will also give the Canadian
companies a presence in the US, insulating them from the protectionist
pressures which are periodically exerted on foreign-based suppliers.

Sufferers from periodontal (gum) disease, which afflicts nearly 80 per cent
of Americans, may some day have a novel way to relieve their symptoms,
writes Karen Zagor.
Sepracor, a Massachusetts biotechnology company, has received a patent
covering toothpaste and mouthwash formulations of two drugs which reduce
inflammation and bone loss.
The two substances, S-ketoprofen and S-flurbiprofen, both of which are
single isomer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are already on the
market as analgesics in 'racemic' form - a mixture of two mirror-image
chemical molecules.
Sepracor believes that its single isomer technology will create drugs which
are purer and should also be cheaper to manufacture. Sepracor: US, 508

FT  12 MAR 93 / Contractor to run Docklands trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S state-owned Docklands Light Railway is to pay a private-sector
contractor Pounds 30m over the next three years to manage the expansion of
the railway and make the trains run on time.
Brown &amp; Root, the US engineering contractor, is to manage and co-ordinate
contracts for the introduction of new trains and signalling systems and
oversee the commissioning of an extension of the railway to Beckton in the
Royal Docks.
The deal is unusual in Britain's railway industry as British Rail and London
Underground normally take sole responsibility for the management of railway
projects.
Last year the government transferred ownership of the notoriously unreliable
DLR from London Transport to the London Docklands Development Corporation
and installed a new management team led by Sir Peter Levene, former head of
defence procurement at the Ministry of Defence.
Sir Peter said appointment of an external company was one of the first
decisions taken by the new management team.
Although new to railways, he said, the approach was commonplace in defence
procurement - as, for example, when a company such as British Aerospace is
appointed as prime contractor for a defence project.
Brown &amp; Root, a partner in the consortium running Plymouth's Devonport
dockyard, will be paid in stages according to its success in reaching
specific targets in the railway's development.
Its first task will be to get the Beckton extension into passenger service
by October this year. It then has to introduce a new signalling and control
system to the rest of the railway and make sure the new fleet of trains
being phased in works with the new control system.

AEROPORTS de Paris (ADP), the company which runs the Charles de Gaulle and
Orly airports, saw net profits rise by 46.4 per cent to FFr558m (Dollars
102m) in 1992, from FFr381m in 1991.
The group benefited last year from healthy growth in the number of
passengers, compared with 1991, when both business and leisure traffic was
badly affected by the Gulf war.
The number of passengers rose 13.6 per cent to 50.4m in 1992. The number of
commercial flights rose by 7.4 per cent to 496,000 and the volume of freight
increased at the same rate to 980,000 tonnes.
This fuelled a 13.6 per cent increase in Aeroports de Paris' sales to
FFr6.1bn last year. The group forecasts further growth of 7 per cent this
year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VNU, the Dutch publishing group, yesterday identified a Dutch printing
company, De Boer Boekhoven, as a possible partner for its printing division
which has been a candidate for full or partial divestment since 1990.
The company was forced to concede that it was negotiating with De Boer after
a Dutch newspaper reported that VNU was poised to sell a majority stake in
the division to the printing company. VNU declined to comment further on the
press report or on the negotiations, which it described as being in the
early stages.
The choice of De Boer comes as a surprise because it is smaller in size than
VNU's printing division and because a foreign buyer had been expected to
come forward.
Earlier this week, VNU postponed the publication of its annual figures until
late March or early April, raising expectations that news on the
long-awaited divestment was imminent. The deal is expected to be take
retroactive effect from December 31.
VNU, whose third-party printing turnover of Fl 569m (Dollars 307m) generates
20 per cent of group turnover, is aiming to become less vulnerable to the
business cycle by reducing its exposure to printing.
The other two major publishers in the Netherlands, Elsevier and Wolters
Kluwer, have long since withdrawn from printing.
VNU will remain more cyclical, however, because of its major involvement in
consumer publishing.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Choice for Escobar is surrender or die
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE police hunt for Pablo Escobar intensifies and more of his associates
are killed, captured or give themselves up, the chief of the Medelln drug
cartel seems to have little chance of staying alive unless he surrenders
once again to the Colombian authorities.
In his latest move, he has requested protection for his family and the
mediation of the Catholic Church, recalling the pattern that led up to his
first surrender in 1991.
Escobar has never been under such pressure: since his escape from jail last
July, a special search force has carried out thousands of operations in and
around Medelln - dawn patrols, helicopter sweeps, road-blocks and,
increasingly, raids mounted as a result of tip-offs.
His safe territory is dwindling as even Medelln residents turn against his
random terror tactics. And the revenge of a band known as the Pepes  -
people persecuted by Pablo Escobar - has left a trail of more than 40 dead
employees, collaborators and gunmen and several burnt-out family properties.
Last month, Escobar's family tried to flee to the US, but Colombian
immigration officials stopped them because papers permitting his children to
travel did not carry Escobar's signature. The US embassy in Bogota then
revoked their visas. Now the only surrender condition publicised by Escobar
is protection for his family; but a warrant is out for the 17-year-old son
who has been linked to the murder of a police captain.
The government has firmly rejected any negotiations for re-surrender. The
shaming memories of Escobar's luxurious prison life and the way he imposed
his own requirements on the authorities in 1991 make any under-the-counter
deal impossible.
With over a dozen cases of murder, terrorism and trafficking to face,
Escobar can now expect a much longer and less comfortable prison sentence
than when he first surrendered. But the circle is tightening and the Medelln
cartel has lost key military and financial personnel.
Already, Medelln has lost much of the drug trade to the Cali organisation.
By forgoing violence against the public and using more subtle tactics, such
as the infiltration of local business and political institutions, the Cali
groups have kept out of the limelight and built up their trafficking
networks in Europe and North America, as well as neighbouring South American
countries and new Far Eastern markets.
Apart from some international operations against money-laundering, the
authorities have made few moves against the Cali drug lords and some experts
believe it may be too late.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S two state television channels yesterday faced a challenge from Mr
Nicola Grauso, a media baron from Sardinia, who revealed that the 12 pirate
Polish TV stations he controls were to form a network broadcasting
programmes and advertising in prime time.
The stations, which have operated independently until now, cover half the
country's 39m population and two thirds of its consumer spending power. Mr
Grauso, who owns a third of each station, said the programming would come
from RAI, the Italian state-owned broadcaster, as well as Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest company.
Mr Grauso owns the L'Unione Sarda newspaper in Sardinia and has invested
Dollars 15m in the Zycie Warszawy, a popular Warsaw daily newspaper. The
move steals a march on media conglomerates which have been waiting for the
enactment of a law ending the state radio and TV monopoly.

ROMANIA'S privatisation authorities yesterday published a list of the first
162 candidates in a scheme designed to sell-off 2,000 small companies over
the next two years.
However, doubts were cast on plans for the privatisation of larger companies
by the new administration board of the State Ownership Fund (SOF), which
manages and owns the state's 70 per cent stake in the 6,280 commerical
companies due for privatisation.
Mr Emil Dima, the SOF's new president, said he was opposed to selling-off or
closing down medium-sized and large companies considered not viable purely
on financial grounds. He said he would even oppose shutting down the 112
black-listed enterprises which the government had identified as the chief
causes of the 'financial blockage'.
Reformers within the government have pledged to take action against the 112
companies which are contributing to the country's crippling level of
inter-enterprise arrears, estimated at more than Dollars 2.5bn.
Mr Dima, a senator representing the ruling left-wing Democratic National
Salvation Front, said: 'Some of these companies are too important to be
closed. We cannot do without them and must consider the social impact
shutting them down would have.'
Rather, the state should increase its intervention in the economy to boost
production and efficiency, he said.
The SOF said the 2,000 small companies earmarked for early privatisation
were likely to be sold chiefly via management and employee buy-outs.
Employees would have the first option on the companies and would be eligible
for some state financing state at interest rates around half the market
rate.
Companies not sold to employees are to be auctioned.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE END of Milan's new third metro line, itself the subject of
investigations into kickbacks to political parties, is the southern suburb
of San Donato, developed over the past 30 years into the operating
headquarters of the Eni group.
The site is next to the city's ring motorway and minutes from Linate
airport, from which Eni operates a twice-daily private shuttle to Rome. It
is ideal for a concern with its top management in the capital but its
subsidiaries and day-to-day operations in Milan.
San Donato, developed by Eni's Immobiliare Metanopoli property arm, is an
odd jumble of modern office blocks set in ample grounds within a nondescript
dormitory town.
On Wednesday night the tranquillity was shattered by flashing blue lights
and sirens as the chairmen of three of the five Eni subsidiaries based at
San Donato were arrested. Cleaners were told to drop their mops as
magistrates and the Guardia di Finanza fiscal police moved in to seal
offices in the Agip, Snam and Saipem blocks.
By yesterday morning, a full search was under way as staff, first kept
waiting outside, gradually returned to work after clarifying details of the
information and documents in their offices. Material judged useful was set
aside for collection in offices which remained sealed.
The focus of magistrates' attention appeared to be financial, particularly
documents relating to group accounts or payments abroad, according to one
official. That would accord with recent allegations that Eni, with its vast
foreign network, has for years been a source of illegal funds for Italy's
political parties, with payments said to have been made through a complex
financial network into foreign accounts.
While staff may not be entirely displeased that the Milan corruption
investigations have finally focused on Eni, a group dominated by the
discredited Italian Socialist party, there is clear concern about the future
now that Mr Gabriele Cagliari, Eni's chairman, and the heads of four
subsidiaries are being held in Milan's San Vittore prison.
Attention has been concentrated on the headquarters of Snam, Eni's biggest
subsidiary in terms of sales, and the one that provides property and
communications services for the whole group.
By late yesterday, investigations had also been completed in its penthouse
14th floor, used by senior executives when visiting from Rome.
Snam is also the parent company for Immobiliare Metanopoli, which has big
plans for the further development of the San Donato site.
Last year, former president Francesco Cossiga came to open the sparkling
fifth palazzo, now housing Agip's headquarters.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government sidesteps Maastricht
confrontation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT suffered its second humiliation of the week in the Commons
chamber last night as it pulled back from a trial of strength with Labour
and Tory Euro-sceptics over forcing an extended sitting to debate the
Maastricht bill.
Tory business managers decided against calling a vote to extend last night's
sitting after 10pm - despite hinting heavily that they planned to do so -
when it became clear that the government risked losing it. On Monday the
government lost its first vote on Maastricht.
The move was dictated partly by the decision of the Liberal Democrats not to
support the government in seeking to extend debate.
Labour was quick to jump on the retreat, claiming the government could not
'control its troops or its business.' Mr George Robertson, front bench
spokesman on Europe, said: 'This now seems to be a minority government; it
is discredited at home and abroad.'
The government's discomfort was increased by the palpable disgruntlement of
some Tory loyalists who argued that the repeated climbdowns were destroying
morale.
It was the second time in a day the government had drawn back from
confrontation. An attack on Tory Euro-sceptics by pro-Maastricht
Conservative backbenchers had earlier been defused at the 11th hour on the
direct orders of Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip.
A crowded meeting of the 1922 committee - the group that embraces all Tory
backbenchers - broke up after just five minutes when officers of the group
relayed the call for a public display of peace.
But before the brief meeting closed, Sir Marcus Fox, the committee's
chairman, admitted he had received a letter signed by some 85 pro-Europeans.
It cited a precedent to back the claim that the committee was originally
formulated to ensure support for the government whip. The letter's aim is to
renew pressure on some five Euro-sceptic members not to oppose the
government in crucial votes on the Maastricht bill.
Belying the spirit of the truce, one leading Euro-sceptic countered that
their opponents' failure to press home their attack represented another
victory for the rebels.
The government last night played down the latest setback to its plans,
saying it was content with the speed with which the Maastricht bill was
progressing through committee. Earlier Mr John Major reiterated his
determination at the weekly cabinet meeting to see the legislation through
and, at question time in the Commons, attacked those keen to delay it.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, also went on the offensive,
concluding a generally conciliatory speech on subsidiarity by asserting he
could imagine no 'more feeble and foolish posture' than that of Maastricht
opponents who nonetheless supported Britain's EC membership.
Unofficial calculations reinforced the feeling at Westminster that the
government faces more trouble, since it appears to be reliant on support
from minority parties to stave off defeat on Labour's controversial social
chapter amendment.
Although the government's law officers have taken the position that passage
of the amendment - which seeks to remove the protocol containing Britain's
social chapter opt-out - would still allow it to ratify the treaty, it would
take Britain into uncharted legal territory.
This was underlined last night as word began to spread of fresh legal advice
in the Euro-sceptics' hands suggesting that if the protocol remained in the
treaty, it could be used as guidance by the European Court in adjudicating
on trade disputes between Britain and other EC countries.

FT  12 MAR 93 / The Taurus Collapse: Finger of blame pointed as job losses
announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THIS TAURUS thing is an industry, not a project,' said a consultant with
knowledge of the Stock Exchange's abandoned settlement system yesterday.
His thoughts were graphically borne out by the size of the clear-out
accompanying its formal cancellation. Together with the resignation of Mr
Peter Rawlins as chief executive, the departures of 220 exchange staff and a
further 130 on contracts were also announced. Many more jobs are expected to
be lost in the City as financial institutions curtail their own Taurus work.
With the news of the clear-out, the search for culprits began.
Until August 1989 there was no project director with overall responsibility
for Taurus, only a technical team working on the project. The exchange
brought in Mr John Watson, a consultant from Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, which
merged later with Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Yesterday his team was by implication blamed for failing to realise earlier
that the project could not be completed at an acceptable cost. Sir Andrew
Hugh Smith, the exchange's chairman, did not name him but said: 'We were
testing parts of the system while others had not been designed or built. It
was only at the heart of the project that this was known.'
He added that 'there may have been an element of self-delusion' among the
Taurus project staff which had prevented them from seeing the enormity of
the problems at an earlier stage.
Mr Watson had been a former deputy chief executive of the exchange, who had
lost out in the race for the chief executive's job to Mr Jeffery Knight, Mr
Rawlins' predecessor. Mr Watson whipped momentum into the project and won
widespread support in the City. A dogged, hard-working man, he was seen as
giving the project the best chance it had. There have been few if any calls
for his resignation over the years.
Doubts began to gather last autumn, and Andersen Consulting was called in to
examine the project. Its advice, which came as a shock, was that the project
was inoperable and should be scrapped.
Early this year the technical side of the project was taken out of Mr
Watson's hands and given to Mr Stewart Senior, a consultant with Coopers &amp;
Lybrand, and an urgent review was undertaken to see if anything could be
done.
Mr Peter Rawlins was blamed yesterday for his failure to exert more control
over the project. When he became chief executive in 1990 he turned his
attention to other matters: how to cut costs and streamline the exchange.
A former senior employee at the exchange said: 'Taurus was either going to
be Peter Rawlins' crowning glory or his nemesis. He never gripped it.'

FT  12 MAR 93 / EC laws 'will not delay tendering': Minister seeks to
clarify rules on workers' rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY legislation protecting the rights of employees in mergers
will not delay the government's market-testing programme to put almost
Pounds 1.5bn of Civil Service work out to tender, Mr William Waldegrave,
public service minister, said yesterday.
He was responding to confusion over whether work contracted out to the
private sector is covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) regulations 1981, which implement the EC legislation in UK law.
If the rules apply, a successful bidder must take over staff on their
existing terms and conditions, which removes the scope for savings through
lower pay or cutting staff.
Uncertainty over Tupe regulations has affected market-testing in several
government departments including the Home Office and the Crown Prosecution
Service. Contractors have also warned that confusion over the regulations
could wreck the Conservatives' plans to increase contracting-out of public
services.
Mr Waldegrave said, however, that the question of whether the regulations
apply had to be decided on the facts of each case. Even when Tupe rules
applied, he expected bidders to be able to make 'genuinely innovative
proposals' that would offer good value for money. Mr Waldegrave's statement
in reply to a parliamentary question coincided with the publication of
Cabinet Office guidelines on the scope of the regulations.
These list instances in which the Tupe regulations are likely to apply to a
particular contract, such as where the contractor employs 'substantially the
same staff to do the same work as before, using the same premises and the
same equipment'.
The regulations are also likely to apply if the contractor has to take over
a group of key employees to continue the work. They will probably also apply
if the employer takes over the management or control of assets used by the
previous employer that are 'significant in relation to that activity'.
The regulations are unlikely to apply, the guidelines say, where the
contractor 'conducts the operation substantially differently without making
significant use of previous staff, key employees, premises or equipment'.
They are also unlikely to apply if 'the identity of the previous undertaking
is substantially changed' and new staff are employed in 'a different
organisational structure'.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Cost of hospital criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs ATTACKED the Treasury yesterday for failing to control the construction
of the Pounds 230m Chelsea and Westminster hospital. A damning report
complained of cost overruns, delays, poor management and big losses caused
by the property slump.
The cross-party Public Accounts Committee says the National Health Service
should 'take a more cautious approach on projects which rely on the property
market to fund developments'. Problems over the hospital have led to 24
other projects being postponned or cancelled.
The report expresses 'surprise' that NHS managers did not take account of
the rising number of surplus hospital beds in London and surrounding areas.
The hospital was meant to be funded by the sale of surplus sites as part of
a rationalisation exercise by the North West Thames Regional Health
Authority. Instead, there is a Pounds 100m gap between expected total costs
and sale proceeds.
The MPs say they expect the NHS management executive 'to take prompt action
to establish who was responsible for the delays in construction and
consequent overrun in completing the project and to seek compensation for
the financial consequences for the NHS'.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Cuts in Tube budget attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON UNDERGROUND yesterday tried to embarrass the government over the
spending cuts imposed on it in last year's Autumn Statement by spelling out
the effects.
It wrote to 59 London MPs, 11 members of the European parliament, 31
boroughs, three county councils and four district councils naming 140
stations that would be adversely affected by cuts in its investment
programme.
In what appeared to be an attempt to position itself for an increased budget
in this year's spending round, it said the results of last year's investment
cut would include:
Cancellation or delays to improvements in passenger security - through help
points, closed-circuit television or better lighting - at 47 stations.
Proposals to alleviate congestion at 13 stations would be postponed.
Plans to refurbish 48 stations would not go ahead as quickly as planned.
Escalator replacement and refurbishment would be delayed at 18 stations.
Improvements to the 'largely antiquated and difficult-to-hear' passenger
information systems would be deferred at 57 stations.
The letters said other consequences of the spending cuts included:
Refurbishment of trains on the District, Piccadilly and Metropolitan lines
would be deferred.
The long-awaited start to the modernisation of the Northern Line would be
delayed until at least 1996.
The proposed extensions of the East London Line northwards to Highbury &amp;
Islington and southwards to East Dulwich would be postponed to 1996-97 at
the earliest.
London Underground said the Autumn Statement had resulted in its investment
budget for 1993-94 being cut from Pounds 860m to Pounds 570m. In contrast,
investment in the roads programme was being increased, it said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS that Hungary's exports plummeted in the first two months of the year
are fuelling pressure on the Budapest government for a devaluation of the
currency.
The Hungarian international economic relations ministry conceded yesterday
that, in January and February, there had been a considerable fall in
deliveries from the levels reached a year earlier.
Officials denied press reports that the decline was as high as 40 per cent.
Even so, the latest reports are given some credibility by more solid figures
showing that current account performance deteriorated sharply in the last
quarter of 1992.
Such leading exporters as Tungsram, the General Electric lighting subsidiary
which suffered a record Ft9bn (Pounds 72m) loss in 1992, are also pressing
for exchange rate adjustment.
But the central bank moved yesterday to quash speculation about a
devaluation. 'Exports are weak but to go from that to an exchange rate
conclusion is a long way,' said Mr Imre Tarafas, deputy president of the
National Bank of Hungary.
The bank has consistently revalued the currency in real terms to maintain
downward pressure on inflation since the country began its economic
stabilisation programme.

<TEXT>
AMERICAN consumers have begun the New Year in a more cautious vein,
according to the latest retail sales figures published by the Commerce
Department.
In February, total sales rose by a modest 0.3 per cent compared with the
previous month.
The department also revised downwards its original estimates for January,
from an improvement of 0.3 per cent to no change from December, when sales
had jumped by 1.1 per cent.
Last month, durable goods sales fell by 0.5 per cent, largely because of
weak demand for cars and light trucks, purchases of which fell by 2.2 per
cent to an annual rate of 12.6m units.
Non-durable sales went up in February by 0.7 per cent, led by strong
performances at grocery stores and petrol stations. Department stores sales
generally held on to their Christmas gains.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Peace mediators seek help from Milosevic
</HEADLINE>

THE international mediators seeking a peace settlement in Bosnia-Hercegovina
yesterday tried to enlist the help of Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic
in persuading the Bosnian Serbs to accept their plan for a Bosnian state
divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces.
But the meeting between Mr Cyrus Vance, Lord Owen and Mr Milosevic, hosted
at the Elysee Palace by President Francois Mitterrand of France, was
undermined even before it started by statements by both the Bosnian Moslems
and Serbs that they were not prepared to endorse the peace plan in its
present form.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen had hoped to isolate Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian
Serb leader. But they were thwarted when President Alija Izetbegovic, the
Moslem Bosnian president, said on Wednesday he would not return to the peace
talks in New York at the end of this week to sign the mediators' map, as he
had previously intimated.
Mr Izetbegovic has delayed his return to New York until the middle of next
week at the earliest, pending further consultations with other members of
the joint Bosnian presidency, several of whom, including Mr Ejup Ganic, the
vice-president, are reported to be strongly opposed to the Vance-Owen plan.
When Mr Izetbegovic finally returns to New York, he is expected to take with
him demands for changes to the map which will almost certainly prove
unacceptable to Mr Karadzic.
In a letter to the British newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, published
yesterday, Mr Karadzic warned the mediators and the international community
against any attempt to isolate or oust him. Stressing that the Vance-Owen
map was acceptable neither to the Serbs nor the Moslems, the Bosnian Serb
leader said: 'We should recognise that fact and not believe that assent can
be imposed.'
Before meeting Mr Milosevic, Mr Vance emphasised that the mediators would
talk 'totally frankly' about the problems facing them.
They were expected to tell him that, if the Bosnian Serbs refused to
subscribe to the peace plan, Serbia would face tougher United Nations
sanctions. These would include total diplomatic isolation and draconian new
measures to stop supplies reaching the country along the Danube.
Lord Owen said the Paris talks offered the Bosnian Serbs an opportunity 'to
move ahead of the game', by which he is understood to mean that, by
accepting the peace plan now, they could isolate the Moslems, instead of the
other way round.
It remains questionable, however, whether President Milosevic would be
prepared to exert great pressure on his close ally Mr Karadzic to accept the
peace plan as long as the Bosnian Moslems remained uncommitted to it.
President Mitterrand, who has always believed the EC should take a leading
role in solving the crisis of the former Yugoslavia, had a long telephone
conversation on Wednesday evening with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to
discuss the Bosnian situation.

VENEZUELA'S presidential guards fired shots into the air yesterday to
disperse a group of about 50 anti-government protesters after they clashed
with supporters of President Carlos Andres Perez outside the capital, Reuter
reports from Caracas.
The shots, fired just minutes before Mr Perez left Congress following his
state of the nation address, caused protesters and bystanders alike to flee
down side streets or throw themselves to the ground.
No one was injured, but police held three protesters.
The protesters were shouting slogans in support of Lt Col Hugo Chavez Frias,
in jail for leading an attempt to topple the Perez government on February 4
1992.
The guards opened fire when a rock struck one of the escort cars in the
presidential motorcade, but the incident was over in about 10 minutes.
Mr Pe 13/32 rez left without incident a few minutes later and returned to
the Miraflores Palace just three blocks away.

GERMANY'S plan to change its constitution and curb the influx of asylum
seekers is incompatible with the Geneva Convention on refugees, the German
parliament was warned yesterday.
Mr Walter Koisser, of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in
Bonn, told the constitutional committee of the Bundestag: 'Every refugee
must have the chance of fair asylum proceedings, whether he came by air, sea
or from a third country which is judged unsafe.'
Germany is considering amendments to its liberal asylum law which would
allow asylum seekers to be sent back over the German border to third
countries such as Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics and Hungary.
Mr Koisser said the plan would 'violate human rights' unless at least three
conditions were met: asylum seekers must be able to stay in the third
country until the asylum request is processed, they must be given decent
living conditions, and third countries must be declared safe by
international agreements.
He said there was otherwise a danger of 'chain-deportation' which would
imperil the international asylum system.
Mr Koisser recommended an amendment specifying that third countries must
offer protection from persecution and ensure the Geneva Convention on
refugees is respected.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: US Pru may sell reinsurance arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRUDENTIAL Insurance Company of America, the nation's largest insurer,
announced yesterday that it was 'evaluating strategic alternatives' for its
reinsurance subsidiary, Prudential Reinsurance Company - possibly paving the
way for its disposal.
The Pru, which is not related to the British company with the same name, did
not spell out precisely what alternatives it had in mind. However, Mr Robert
Winters, chairman, said it was 'looking to maximise the value' of its
reinsurance subsidiary and did not regard reinsurance as a 'core business'.
'Given current investor interest in the reinsurance sector,' he said, 'we
feel that now is an opportune time to explore alternatives with respect to
the future of Prudential Re.' Financial advisers have been retained to
review the situation.
However, Mr Winters also said the Pru was prepared to retain 100 per cent
ownership of Prudential Re 'if we find that is the best way to optimise its
worth to the Prudential'.
Prudential Re, with its headquarters in Newark, is the fifth largest
reinsurance operation in the US with assets of about Dollars 3.1bn.
The Prudential, which was badly hit by losses from Hurricane Andrew last
year, would not be the first insurer to shed reinsurance operations
recently; last year, Hartford-based Aetna sold Aetna Re-Insurance to a
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts buy-out for Dollars 1.4bn.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Airlines downgraded by S&amp;P
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the Wall Street rating agency, yesterday downgraded
senior debt securities at the three largest US airlines to speculative grade
 -or 'junk bond' - status.
S&amp;P said that it was lowering its rating on the senior debt securities of
United Airlines' parent, UAL, to double-B from triple-B-minus; lowering
AMR's senior debt to double-B-plus from triple-B; and cutting the rating on
Delta Air Lines' senior debt from from triple-B-minus to double-B.
Various other debt securities issued by the 'big three' US carriers were
also downgraded by the rating agency, and in total approximately Dollars
5.7bn-worth of securities were affected by the rating agency's changes.
S&amp;P said that the downgrades were based on 'an adverse industry environment
and a narrowed competitive advantage over second-tier airlines'.
It pointed to the continued overcapacity in the sector, the encroachment of
foreign carriers into the US airline industry, and the persistence of weak
demand due to the slow economic recovery in the US and the recession in
Europe.
It also noted that many of the weaker carriers have been winning wage
concessions from employees, driving down their cost structures and giving
them an operating advantage against the big three.
The big three US carriers last night issued a pre-emptive response on
rumours that the US Department of Transportation may be poised to approve
the British Airways-USAir code-sharing agreement.
They said they were 'enormously disappointed that the Clinton
Administration's first aviation policy decision could give a permanent and
unfair advantage to foreign carriers over US carriers without requiring
reciprocal concessions by the UK'.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (16): Vienna poised to leap the
Danube - Despite the recession - and with a lot of office development
already in progress - the city is about to begin the third-largest urban
redevelopment project in Europe / Austria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE MOIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH each circuit of the revolving restaurant high above Donaupark on the
bank of the Danube in Vienna, a large depression of bare earth comes into
view. Once the city's rubbish tip, it was excavated back to clean soil in
1989 as the city fathers prepared for the Austrian capital to host Expo
1995.
But the Viennese roundly rejected their leaders' ambitions in a referendum
and the site remained just a hole in the ground while the city's planners
went back to the drawing board.
Vienna's mayor was this week due to turn the first sod on the site,
signalling the official start to the infrastructure phase of what is to
become Vienna's 'city over the water' - a full-scale urban centre directly
across the river from St Stefansdom and only seven minutes by underground
from the city centre.
Not only will it be the third-largest urban redevelopment project in Europe
 -creating 470,000 sq m of new space over 10 to 15 years - it will also
represent Vienna's first civic attempt to leap the Danube.
Hitherto, the Viennese have seen the river as their implacable northern
border; expansion has always been southwards. But they have now gone as far
south as they can without tripping over the province of Lower Austria. And
expansion westwards is barred by the Vienna Woods, far too sacred to be
sacrificed to commercialism.
The pull across the river is also dictated by the opening of eastern Europe,
even if that has so far delivered less trade for central Europe's hinge
state than it has exposed deep-seated chaos in the former Soviet satellite
economies. So, in the teeth of recession, the city is poised to make the
leap, using Wiener Entwicklungsgesellschaft fur den Donauraum (Wed) a joint
public-private sector vehicle.
Wed is 70 per cent held by five Austrian banks and two local insurance
companies; 10 per cent by the holding company which controls Vienna's civic
enterprises; and 20 per cent by Nomura as reward for the ground work put in
by the Japanese securities house to the original Expo idea and the
subsequent market research for what will be called Donau City.
It will be a true city centre, not a business park or garden suburb. There
will be a town hall; schools; public and private apartments; possibly a
language institute; and a conference hotel to serve the nearby Austria
Convention Centre. Wed is poised to announce the winner of a beauty parade
of international architects to build the two focal tower blocks.
One will be a corporate headquarters; the other a mix of uses, including
apartments, shops and specialist offices.
A media centre or a diplomatic centre would be natural targets, together
with an aparthotel for medium-term lets, since the site adjoins UNO-City, a
complex of three towers housing the United Nations Industrial Development
Organisation (Unido), the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).
Wed officials deny any parallels with London's Canary Wharf development,
beyond the scale. Their site, says Mr Helmut Reisenberger, manager for
strategy and information, has excellent existing traffic infrastructures; it
is close to a large green space, the Donaupark, within seven minutes of the
city centre and enhanced by its proximity to buildings of international
quality in UNO-City.
Donau City will also be architecturally innovative. Taking advantage of the
pit in the centre of the site, the masterplan allows for two or three
storeys of service roads and car parking below ground level but still, open
air with pedestrian bridges at ground level between the buildings.
But the best thing Donau City has going for it is the fact that the city is
at one with the private sector over its development. Both agree that
Vienna's historic inner core is unsuited to large scale future development.
Planning permissions are now unlikely for large schemes within the Ring
which marks the old city walls. There is also agreement on the need to
prevent dormitory suburbs and on the potential of the river banks as
development sites.
Such civic harmony is a feature of the city which has a 10-year-old
institution - the Vienna Promotion Fund backed by the city, the Chamber of
Commerce and several banks - devoted to promoting inward investment while
avoiding urban sprawl.
This approach still encourages competition between sites and developers.
Donau City is not the only large urban project underway. A kilometre or so
north is the old Aspern airfield whose days of glory as Vienna's inter-war
airport are long gone.
The district - an area the size of Salzburg - is now earmarked for
industrial development.
Detailed zoning is expected this autumn and Profund, meanwhile, is building
a list of developers, industrialists and craft operations interested in
moving in where General Motors already has a large gearbox and motor
assembly plant.
There is also an unusually high level of office development under
construction at present - perhaps 300,000 sq m is due to come on the market
this year.
At a time when take-up is not in excess of 100,000 sq m a year, this does
not bode well for rents which have already weakened by between 5 per cent
and 15 per cent, depending on which agent's review you read.
Mr Anthony Sutcliffe, who manages central Europe business from Richard
Ellis's Vienna office, confirms that there are letting problems in most
schemes, especially those in secondary locations.
But some of the schemes under way, either just within or just outside the
Ring, will benefit in the medium term from the clampdown on development in
the first district. They include a 19,000 sq m office development by the
Swiss insurance group Winterthur on the Karntnerring, which is to be
connected by bridge to a mixed 40,000 sq m retail, office and hotel
refurbishment by All Nippon Airways, also under way.
Scandinavian groups continue to be active. At Wien Mitte, above the railway
and underground station, SPP/LET is working with local partners on an 80,000
sq m office and retail scheme, having just finished the 37,000 sq m Concorde
Business Park, close to the airport. Bygg/Fasst has two large schemes - on
Maria Hilferstrasse and Handelskai - on the way. Jones Lang Wootton and
local agent Linikus Consulting have just begun pre-marketing for Pharos
House, a 12,300 sq m courtyard office complex by Skandia Insurance on
Nordbahnstrasse, close to the station in the second district.
These will all take ingenuity to fill at rents near the current record,
which Richard Ellis estimates to be the equivalent of Dollars 36 a sq ft. To
call it a crisis, however, would be far from the truth. Austria's stable
economy, the careful phasing of larger projects and the consensus on
location and quality architecture provide a solid foundation.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (15): An unpredictable fledgling
 -For a foreign company trying to develop or acquire office space - even in
Moscow - property rights are still uncertain and the red tape is formidable
/ The CIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New legislation and new buildings springing up in Moscow underpin the
reappearance of a real estate market in Russia after seven decades of
Communist rule which nationalised state property and stifled private
enterprise.
But the workings of the fledgling market remain arbitrary, unpredictable and
limited to certain parts of the former Soviet Union.
International demand for office space and other real estate remains greater
in Moscow than anywhere else in the 15 newly-independent former Soviet
republics.
Other pockets where real estate is in demand but not necessarily available
include St Petersburg, Russia's second city and traditional 'window on the
west', and Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, the second most populous republic
which started privatisation only this month.
The Baltic republics, among the most open to foreign investment of the
former republics, also offer opportunities. Lithuania allows foreigners
leases of up to 99 years, while the Estonians allow outright foreign
ownership except where otherwise specified.
The TransCaucasian republics remain volatile (including Georgia, a land rich
in tourist potential but which is involved in a civil war), while the
Central Asian republics are remote or slow to open up to foreigners.
In Russia, in theory, everything is allowed except for outright foreign land
ownership: its unrestricted sale and purchase has been blocked so far by the
conservative parliament.
Although this has not yet been put to practice, the only land which
foreigners can own outright is that beneath enterprises bought in the
government's privatisation campaign.
But for a foreign company trying to develop, or acquire, office space even
in Moscow, property rights are still uncertain, the red-tape formidable, and
the need for reliable local advice and partners overwhelming in the absence
of clear-cut rules and business ethics.
'You need 12 to 14 signatures for any project, and the bureaucracy,
regulations and (lack of) ethics make life very difficult,' says Mr Haluk
Gercek of Mosenka, a joint venture between Enka, the Turkish construction
group, and Mosstroi, one of the capital's state-owned construction
authorities.
Having completed 1,200 sq m of office space which is being let out to
foreign companies such as Renault-Volvo, and Allianz, the German insurance
company, Mosenka is now contemplating negotiating the right to the freehold.
Its present lease on a building which it rebuilt with its own funds and bank
loans is for 25 years.
But Mr Alexander Papachristou, attorney with US law firm White and Case in
Moscow, insists that despite the problems Moscow real estate can be a
judicious investment opportunity. He believes that foreign developers and
banks risk being closed out for being too sceptical, for 'not being willing
to consider some risk and explore security opportunities that are within the
law.'
'Six months ago I would have said there were terrible problems with the law.
A lot of people are frustrated. But others are getting things done. A lot is
being done by Russian companies, joint ventures, small western companies,
not large real estate developers. The hotels are not being opened by the big
names.'
While he stresses the need for caution - ensuring for a start that Russian
parties to a deal have clear rights to the properties they are signing over
 -he admits that so far he has not heard of any foreign company buying a
building.
His own firm has a short lease on premises rented from the Central Telegraph
Office - a widespread sort of practice that involves leasing space from
state-owned organisations with lots of space and a need for cash.
Most newly-emerging Russian companies prefer not to spend their money on
expensive offices, not least to avoid attracting attention from the public,
the tax-inspectors and the Mafia. More often than not, they lease space from
state-owned enterprises, schools, or various institutes and public
associations strapped for cash for their upkeep.
There are basically two possibilities. One is acquiring state-owned property
sold by the city authorities - a path little tried since new rules were
imposed stipulating that this can only be done through auction, and not by
special arrangement with the mayor's office. The other - which remains
popular for being simpler even though it does not usually entail ownership -
is jointly developing and leasing from state-owned institutions that already
occupy buildings.
The main customers for offices meeting western standards are foreign
companies and rich Russian banks for whom solid-looking offices are part of
the business of inspiring confidence.
The demand for decent office space and the lack of competition in supplying
it has meant that prices are among the highest in the world, with a square
metre of western-style office space in central Moscow costing an average of
Dollars 700 a year.
'We are trying to keep the prices very high because there is no market here;
there is not much space of this quality,' admits Mr Konstantin Gusikov,
development director of Perestroika, a pioneering US-Soviet joint venture in
real estate which started up in 1988 and has finished several buildings. 'We
are doing western-style real estate and asking for western-style rent.'
One of the recent arrivals on the property development scene is McDonald's,
which is putting up an office building just down the road from the hamburger
restaurant it opened three years ago, gaining both a name and contacts to
help it obtain its prime site from the mayor's office.
While Mosenka says it has opted for a step-by-step approach, Mr Gusikov
complains the only thing Perestroika lacks to press on with an aggressive
building strategy is money.
It is looking for finance of Dollars 100m for each of five new sites in
central Moscow, and promises potential lenders secure title over the
buildings as collateral until debts are paid back.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (14): Prague continues to set
the pace - With its road links to other big European cities and its
population of 1.2m the city is likely to remain the most important market in
the two republics / Czech and Slovak Republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE STEADMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is clearly too early to assess the longer-term prospects of the very
recent partition of Czechoslovakia into the separate Czech and Slovak
republics. Observers are cautiously optimistic. And so far it appears to be
a case of a 'velvet' divorce following the 'velvet revolution' of 1989.
Bratislava has been elevated to the capital city of the new Slovakia. But
Prague, with its road links to other big European cities, its heritage and
its population of 1.2m is likely to remain the most important property
market in either of the two republics.
The former Czechoslovakia took the decision to attempt to restore land to
its pre-1948 owners instead of offering compensation - the favoured option
in other former Eastern bloc countries. And, despite considerable scepticism
in a country where red tape can reach nightmare proportions, the restitution
programme is generally perceived to have gone reasonably well.
Aengevelt, Hillier Parker's German associate, has just published a detailed
research report on 10 eastern European cities. It says that nearly 70 per
cent of buildings in Prague city centre have been restored to their previous
owners. And it adds that properties for sale are not only coming onto the
market through privatisation tenders for former state enterprises, but
increasingly from private individuals whose properties have been restored to
them.
There is, however, a continuing acute shortage of good standard office space
in Prague. And there are many hurdles which would-be developers need to
clear. For a start, Prague is an exceptionally beautiful city and planning
is rigidly controlled. Prague's 'Listed Building Trust' extends to some
750ha and is, according to Aengevelt, the largest such area in the world.
Mr Chris Barrow of Debenham Jean Thouard Zadelhoff estimates that Prague's
existing office stock is in the range of 1.2m-1.6m sq m. However, although
many - if not the majority - of the buildings are architectural gems, most
were left to deteriorate under the previous regime and as much as 90 per
cent is in need of considerable restoration to bring it up to acceptable
western European standards.
Partly because of planning difficulties and the extreme unlikeliness of any
demolition of existing buildings, new development has largely been confined
to a few refurbishments. Jones Lang Wootton estimates that the stock of such
offices amounts to about 30,000 sq m.
However, the European Business Centre, close to the city centre, was a
totally new building, completed in Prague last year. Developed by European
Property Developments of Vienna, it provides a total of 2,990 sq m on seven
levels behind a replica facade.
Tenants include Philip Morris, Jacobs Suchard and RWE Konrad Adenauer
Stiftung. Rents, quoted in Swiss francs and payable in Czech korunas, vary
from SFr55 a sq m a month to SFr 60 a sq m a month.
New supply in 1993 is likely to be dominated by the 24,000 sq m
International Business Centre immediately behind the new Atrium Hotel. The
complex will be the first truly modern office building in Prague. The
developer is the French construction company CBC with the mighty French fund
Caisse des Depots et Consignations. Jones Lang Wootton is quoting rents of
between DM52 a sq m a month and DM60 sq m a month - again payable in local
currency.
Caisse des Depots is also involved with the prominent Myslbek site, one of
the few prime available sites in the favoured first district. The plan is to
build 20,000 sq m of offices and 10,000 sq m of new shopping space. Now at
detailed design stage, a start on site should be made this year says Mr
Angus Mcintosh of Healey &amp; Baker.
As part of the deal, the site owner, the City of Prague, will receive
slightly more than DM53m for a 99-year lease, DM12.8m of which will take the
form of a 20 per cent stake in a joint venture between Caisse des Depots and
the City.
Despite Prague's clear need and unsated demand for new office space,
relatively high rents and little prospect of oversupply, some investors are
holding back. For example, the European Plaza development on the main access
route to Prague airport, due to start in spring last year, is still stalled
on the starting blocks.
The project is planned to total 18,000 sq m and be built in three phases.
However, despite backing from a consortium of Austrian and Swiss banks and
various assorted others, nothing has yet happened. Now the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development has conditionally agreed to come on board and
there just may be some action, say joint agents Healey &amp; Baker and Rydens.
There are quite a few other projects where much talk a year or so ago has
not been translated into visible activity. For example, the Wilson railway
station site with which AMEC has been associated and the Bubny site where
there is apparently a possible 1m sq m of new space, and the US property
developers Edward Callam Interests are involved, are cases in point.
However, in the context of the highly nervous state of most western
economies it seems that few financial institutions or other potential
sources of finance will be keen to rush in to support such large, long-term,
expensive and highly risky propositions. It will no doubt be several years
before these highly ambitious plans have any real chance of being taken
forward.
Bratislava has historic experience as a capital city - it was first so
designated in 1536 when it became the capital of the Hapsburg portion of
Hungary. However, realistically, with its population of a mere 441,500 and a
fair representation of the concrete block style of architecture among its
buildings, it has some way to go. In fact, when comparing the starting
positions of both new republics it appears that Slovakia will have the more
difficult transition to economic independence in most respects.
There is very little office space available in Bratislava's city centre.
Aengevely reckons that already there is un-met demand for at least 10,000 sq
m. This amount will clearly increase as the city's new role evolves.
Office rents in city locations are now standing at between DM14 a sq m a
month and DM32 sq m a month - and up to DM9.50 a sq m a month in areas
within 15 to 20 minutes' travelling time.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (13): Focus on Budapest - There
are shortages of certain types and sizes of accommodation / Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE STEADMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Of all the former Eastern bloc countries, Hungary is perceived to have made
the most progress towards a western-style economy and life-style. Its
property market, which has evolved from the chaotic embryonic state of a few
years ago to the point where there are a few identifiable markets and market
trends, reflects this.
But it still has some way to go before it matures to the level of western
markets.
Greatest attention is focused on Budapest - the so-called 'Paris of the
east.' The city has been the subject of a considerable amount of commercial
property development in recent times. Mr Michael Hodges of Jones Lang
Wootton estimates that 130,000 sq m of new office accommodation came onto
the Budapest market last year alone.
To put this into perspective, Mr Hodges points out that this represents more
than double the comparable amount in Barcelona - where the Olympic Games
generated unprecedented activity.
Of all this new space, Jones Lang Wootton calculates that some 84 per cent
was either let or sold - and that there is a further 100,000 sq m of mainly
international standard offices under construction.
The severe shortage of good offices which saw prospective tenants scrambling
to sign up for pre-lets at Skanska's 17,300 sq m East West Business Centre,
the first private development of any size in the city, at up to DM60 a sq m
a month, is clearly a relic of the past.
Mr Phil Hudson of East 8, the specialist eastern European real estate
consultancy which has just published the third REDEE (Real Estate
Development in Eastern Europe) Report, notes that there is now good quality,
new office space standing empty in Budapest - unthinkable in 1991.
The froth has also come off the top of rents - or at least they have
'stabilised'. Top office rents in the central area are now about DM50 a sq m
a month, with good buildings outside the central core going for 30-40 per
cent less. There is a general consensus, however, that there is no real
oversupply - there are even shortages of certain types and sizes of
accommodation.
There is a tendency towards shorter leases - some for as little as a year.
This gives landlords the opportunity to adjust for inflation - currently
running at about 30 per cent - on a frequent basis. Rents are still
denominated in hard currency but are payable, since last April, in Hungarian
forints. Rents may also be linked to the rate of exchange between the forint
and a hard currency or indexed to a hard currency.
Demand is still predominantly from western companies and has fallen back a
little, according to Mr Anthony Sutcliffe of Richard Ellis. He considers
that the worldwide recession has made organisations more realistic about the
scale of their operations - and their likely rates of future expansion.
Despite the relatively advanced state of the Budapest property market there
is still no sign of an emerging investment market. There were some initial
indications of interest from a few Austrian and German investors. But
despite the recent flurry of development there are still too few buildings
of the required quality available to provide an adequate choice.
There are still problems with clarification of ownership and, added to this,
high interest rates and high inflation play havoc with investment appraisal
calculations.
The few buildings that are sold invariably go to owner-occupiers.
The serviced office concept, new to Budapest, is proving very popular. It
offers the opportunity to walk in and set up in business straight away.
There have been several developments of this nature in the past year or so.
More are planned.
Budapest is increasingly seen as an important location for international
retailers. Prime pitch is the pedestrianised Vaci Utca where space is scarce
and rental levels are, according to Healey &amp; Baker, as much as DM200-DM300 a
sq m a month.
Demand is strong from fashion and household goods retailers. Even so,
operators are mainly taking small units initially, to test the market. For
example Marks and Spencer last year opened a very small outlet selling only
womens' fashions on Vaci Utca. It reputedly reached its first year's sales
target in the first four months of trading.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (12): The market is beginning to
emerge - With its population approaching 40m, Poland represents the largest
potential market in the region. Many western companies rate it as an
important location / Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNE STEADMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRARY to fears expressed after last year's Polish elections which left an
even more divided parliament, the new government seems to have managed to
achieve a degree of political stability. However, as the privatisation
programme drags on there are considerable obstacles still to be negotiated
by potential investors and property developers.
Besides continuing disagreements over land ownership and the bureaucracy of
local district councils which combine to make progress complicated and long
drawn-out, there is difficulty in obtaining the necessary funding for
developments - particularly some of the larger and perhaps over-ambitious
projects which were announced in a blaze of publicity but have yet to get
further than the drawing board.
In this respect Poland is not alone. Other eastern and central European
countries have also fallen victim to the new sense of caution and realism
which has replaced the initial burst of enthusiasm immediately after the
fall of communism.
Strict banking and investment criteria now apply, says Mr Phil Hudson of
East 8, the specialist eastern European real estate consultancy.
The Polish property market is beginning to emerge, however - although it is
still less developed than those of some of its neighbours. Poland, with its
population approaching 40m, represents the largest potential market in the
region and many western companies rate it as an important location in which
to become established.
The focus is on Warsaw where there is still a shortage of office
accommodation which comes up to acceptable western standards - and the
city's top office rents are among the highest in central Europe. However, at
about Dollars 45-Dollars 55 a sq m a month for centrally-located space,
rents have fallen from the heady heights of DM85 a sq m a month which was
paid for space in one of the first new high-quality buildings, the LIM
Centre, a couple of years ago.
Mr Michael Hodges, Jones Lang Wootton partner, estimates that some 60,000 sq
m of new space came onto the market in Poland last year - with 80 per cent
of that being either let or sold. Another 25,000 sq m will be added with the
completion of two further buildings in Warsaw - the IPC Business Centre
(15,000 sq m) and the Warsaw Corporate Centre (10,000 sq m).
There are, however, doubts concerning the level of future supply. Two big
projects appear to be on ice, at least in the short term. The first is a
proposed 40-storey, 75,000 sq m office building in central Warsaw where the
developers may be having second thoughts.
The other project on hold is the US Business Centre, a 25,000 sq m office
development adjoining the Polytechnika metro station, south of the central
business district. Here again, problems are mainly with financing, says Mr
Angus Mclntosh of Healey &amp; Baker. He considers that investors are
increasingly nervous of large-scale, long-term projects. They would rather
take the much safer option of small, fast-track developments. It also let
relatively quickly.
International retailers see Warsaw as an important location and there has
been keen competition to secure representation in the better shopping areas.
Rents on the prime Nowy Swiat and Chmielna are now in the region of Dollars
100 a sq m a month.
Shopping provision in Warsaw, though, is generally poor. The city is crying
out, says Mr McIntosh, for a decent shopping centre which could create its
own glamorous aura - independently of the comparative drabness of the city
centre itself.
Away from Warsaw, the ambitious town centre development in Szczecin is
almost completed. In this town of just 400,000 inhabitants, close to the
German border and 1 1/2 hours' drive from Berlin, the project has been
developed in partnership with the Polish Steamship Company. It consists of a
hotel, to be operated by the US Radisson Group, 25,000 sq m of offices,
3,000 sq m of shops and a casino.
The main office tenant is to be the steamship company and the remainder is
intended for letting to western companies. However, so far little news of
leasing progress - or the lack of it - has filtered through.
Funding comes from the Austrian Girozentrale Vienna which is providing a
DM170m syndicated loan, part of which is guaranteed by the Austrian State
Export Promotion Bank. In addition, Girozentrale is putting in equity of
DM85m.
Developers and sources of finance for development in Poland are coming
mainly from Austria and Germany with a sprinkling of other Europeans and a
few from the US. British developers and investors are conspicuous by their
absence.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (11): Urgent search for drastic
solutions - Property owners in Sweden believe that government intervention
would stabilise the market because it would reduce the necessity for fire
sales / Sweden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE search for drastic solutions to Europe's commercial property malaise is
nowhere more urgent than in Sweden.
The past two years have seen a sharp reversal of the growth of the 1980s,
when bank deregulation, tax reforms, cheap credit and a general mood of
business confidence rapidly inflated office values.
From mid 1990, high real interest rates and a worsening recession have
severely undermined the commercial property market. Vacancy rates have
tripled, property values have halved, the investment market has dried up and
scores of property companies have collapsed leaving their assets in the
hands of the banks.
The slump in the property market has undermined the Swedish banking system
which is suffering from an estimated SKr200bn of non-performing loans. Of
the large commercial banks only one, Svenska Handelsbanken, looks as though
it will be able to survive without government support.
The mounting pressure on the banking system has prompted the government to
set up a commission to examine the matter. While the form in which the
government will intervene is not yet decided, it is possible that the
government will end up guaranteeing the banks' non-performing assets.
The prospect of taking responsibility for banks' bad debts is viewed with
dismay by a government committed to privatisation and to containing a
spiralling budget deficit. But it may be the price that has to be paid to
restore confidence in the Swedish banking system and to stop the free fall
in the property market.
Property owners in Sweden believe that government intervention would
stabilise the property market because it would reduce the necessity for fire
sales. 'When the government and bank negotiations come to an end it will
provide a floor to prices. It will calm things,' says the director of a
large property company.
The enormity of the banks' problems with their SKr275bn of commercial
property loans means that working out the solution will be a lengthy
process. 'The banks understand that they cannot just sell the property. They
will have it for the next 10 to 20 years,' says Mr Anders Klein, a banking
analyst at Enskilda Securities.
The banks are reluctant property owners. They have little appropriate
expertise to manage their newly-formed property companies because
historically they have been legally prevented from direct ownership of
assets. 'The banks were not prepared for this,' says Mr Magnus Dager of
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, property consultant. 'They were not staffed for it.'
The task of managing the newly-formed property holding companies is
daunting. 'Sorting out the problems of 2,000 properties round the world is
an absolutely huge problem,' says Peter Leimdorfer, a property adviser. 'The
properties have often been mismanaged as the owners have lacked the
resources to manage the properties'.
Few of the properties now owned by the banks are in demand from Sweden's
institutional investors. Many are unlet. Office vacancy rates have risen
from 2 per cent to 7 per cent, as a result of the flagging economy and a
surge in construction activity.
The development market was buoyant throughout the second half of the 1980s
until it was checked by the imposition of a 30 per cent tax on new
developments in 1989. Development activity reached a peak of 600,000 sq m of
new offices in 1989, according to Leimdorfer Bernhardtson Westerberg &amp;
Partners, consultants.
Swedish developers also expanded overseas. The gradual lifting of exchange
restrictions from late 1987 prompted many construction companies and
developers to venture abroad to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria
and the UK. More than Skr100bn was spent on investments and developments. In
some cases, particularly in London, these overseas developments have given
rise to even heavier losses than in Stockholm.
At home and abroad, the banks' prospects of recovering the most they can
from their loans ultimately depends on a revival in the health of the
letting market.
Much depends on the state of the Swedish economy, which is facing daunting
problems with growing unemployment and a spiralling public sector deficit.
There is also concern that the scale of the problems inflicted by property
losses could set back the recovery by restricting the banks' ability to make
new loans. However, the krona's forced devaluation last November may have
brought forward a recovery in the property industry. Mr Larsson of Enskilda
believes that short-term interest rates may come down to 5 or 6 per cent in
1993-4. Together with a small rise in inflation, that might help the
overindebted property market.
Although no recovery in rental values is on the horizon for three or four
years at the earliest, Mr Larsson believes that the fall in the property
market may level off by the end of the year. 'It is possible that we have
seen the worst,' he says.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (10): Well placed to ride out
downturn - Not only is the national economy a stable, low-inflationary
environment but the Dutch property market is funded by equity instead of
bank debt / The Netherlands
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   EACH of the four cities which comprise the Randstad
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Hague, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht - has a big urban redevelopment
scheme either planned or under way in the midst of recession. Some of them
have better prospects than others.
In the capital, The Hague, city planners are trying to reverse the
decentralisation policies of the past two decades. As part of an ambitious
redevelopment scheme around the Central Station, which will include a new
town hall, they plan to rejuvenate rundown buildings in the central core to
meet what is estimated to be 100,000 sq m of unsatisfied demand for quality
space.
Unfortunately, no big buildings are yet available, but the plan will gain
strength from the decision to re-centralise government and municipality
departments. It remains to be seen, however, whether unsatisfied private
sector businesses, which drifted out to places such as Zoetermeer, will be
attracted back in.
The Dutch have a saying: 'In The Hague they just talk. In Amsterdam they
agonise. Rotterdamers get on with the job'. Rotterdam has the only true
central business district of any Dutch city. Mr Thom Dijksman, who heads
Jones Lang Wootton's Dutch office, pays tribute to its well-ordered street
grid and its high-rise, high-quality modern buildings. Thus it is no
surprise to find Rotterdam pressing ahead with its version of London's
Docklands development, Kop van Zuid.
On January 30, the city signed a contract with Laing Management of the UK,
SAE of France and MBO, the property arm of the Dutch Internationale
Nederlanden Group (ING), for a feasibility study for Wilhamenapier,
Rotterdam's planned version of London's Canary Wharf. This could provide as
much as 400,000 sq m of office space plus 1,000 apartments and shops on the
south side of the river directly across from the city centre and with good
views of it, according to Mr Dijksman. Advisers to the Wilhamenapier joint
venture are Jones Lang Wootton, Ove Arup and Sir Norman Foster.
Says Mr Dijksman: 'The money is there, the will is there. A new bridge will
be completed within two years. New metro stops are agreed. The area will
house the Court of Justice and provide a new HQ for the port authority.'
Utrecht, the smallest of the four cities, is developing as a niche centre
for the electronics industry. Last month, for example, IBM began building a
new 25,000 sq m training centre in the town, at a time when it is
contracting savagely elsewhere in the world.
Development patterns in the town therefore reflect the needs of companies
such as Digital for stand-alone headquarters on which they can impose their
own corporate image. As a result, relations between the private and public
sector are good.
The same cannot be said in Amsterdam where the private sector is far from
convinced of the merits of the municipality's favoured expansion zone.
Traditionally, ever since business exploded out of the historic canal zone
which is now the museum district of Amsterdam, the city has expanded
southwards. Now the municipality wants to balance that trend with a push to
the north east. It has identified a site, Ij-oevers, on the banks of the
River Ij, and taken on ING as a 50 per cent partner.
But the private sector is not convinced. 'A municipality cannot create a
prime location by decree' is one of the dismissive sayings going the rounds.
The area is none too prepossessing and the plans so ambitious that even the
presence of the port authority and the Chamber of Commerce may not prove a
sufficient magnet.
ING is thought by some merely to be playing a spoiler's game. It refuses to
give up its partnership rights yet only last month again coyly declined to
start work on a plan it deemed 'unviable.'
Amsterdam also has a second development zone in the north at Sloterdijk,
where the municipality is promoting a teleport and B-grade business space
for tenants such as unions or the print works of Elsevier-Reed. But the real
dynamism - as always - is in the south.
Outside the Zuid area and the south east zone with its magnet World Trade
Towers, the area around Schiphol Airport continues to buzz with activity
despite weak rental patterns and the absence of institutional investment
interest elsewhere.
A number of separate developments are under way in and around Hoofddorp,
including a business park by Chipshol Forward, one of the few public
companies confident that a share placing in February would find
institutional takers.
Chipshol is a neat neologism derived from Schiphol (to stress the airport
connection) and microchip. It plans to become Amsterdam's Silicon Valley,
expanding in synch with the airport (which is doubling its capacity) and the
development of new technologies.
Elsewhere, says Mr Glen Cowan, JLW's head of research and consultancy,
investment activity is close to zero. The problems of international
investors, such as the Swedes and Japanese, need no rehearsing.
Dutch investors have also been scorched in ventures abroad.
But Mr Cowan believes the revival has begun. In late February, Rodamco
announced a big retail joint venture in Australia. Back home, Mr Cowan also
detects stirrings in the retail market and he believes drooping bond yields
will soon entice investors back into modern offices with sound covenants.
Meanwhile, the Dutch property market is well placed to ride out the
downturn. Not only is the national economy a stable, low-inflationary
environment, its property market - more than 90 per cent institutional  - is
funded by equity not bank debt.
And, as a further sweetener, the authorities' commitment to the environment
is promoting a concentration of development in the inner ring of the four
main conurbations - just where rents can be maximised.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (9): Bust will not follow
building boom - Since 1985, Belgian office rents have grown strongly and,
compared with other European cities, Brussels still has room for growth /
Belgium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brussels building boom is almost over. But true to its reputation as one
of Europe's most stable property markets, Belgian boom will not be followed
by Belgian bust.
The vacancy rate in the Brussels office market - which accounts for about
three-quarters of office space in Belgium - is rising. As recently as 18
months ago, availability was as low as 2.5 per cent, but according to
January figures, 6.4 per cent of Brussels' 7.45m sq m of office space is now
available for rent.
'In 1993 and the beginning of 1994 I think we are going to see an increase
in availability to 7 or 7.5 per cent,' says Mr Jean-Claude Vandecauter,
general manager of the Brussels office of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. But unlike
developers in the City of London, Belgian developers had anticipated such a
situation as early as 1991. In the words of one Belgian property analyst,
there has been no speculative 'feeding frenzy' among Brussels property
speculators, and the total figure for offices available and sites under
construction is already dropping.
After a speculative surge fuelled by Scandinavian investors two to three
years ago, traditional investors - Belgian, Dutch and French insurance
companies and pension funds - also started to return to the Brussels office
investment market towards the end of last year, boosting a slack year with
investments of some BFr10bn in November and December.
But although such windfalls are welcome, Belgian property professionals are
also rather proud of the stability of Belgian real estate. 'You could say
it's rather boring, but I think it's quite healthy,' says Mr John Travers,
senior partner with Healey &amp; Baker in Belgium. 'You won't see rental
doubling in Belgium, but you will see good rental growth.'
Mr Travers has reason to feel optimistic, despite the likely hiatus in
office building over the next two to three years and the fact that the
Belgian economy is slowing down.
Since 1985, Belgian office rents have grown strongly, well ahead of
inflation, and by comparison with other European cities, Brussels still has
room to grow further. Healey &amp; Baker's 1992-3 survey of office rental gives
the dearest Brussels rent as Dollars 26.18 per square foot, compared with
the most expensive London West End property at Dollars 64.39.
One reason is that the Brussels market is supported by the presence of
international institutions, notably the EC and Nato.
Last December's Edinburgh summit confirmed what most people have always
assumed - that Brussels was the permanent seat of the Commission, the
biggest EC institution - and thus underscored the decision of myriad lobby
groups, legal firms, international companies and others to establish offices
in Brussels.
The average take-up of office space in Brussels is about 250,000 sq m a
year, but the institutional appetite for space means it is a market which
will always benefit from unexpected increases in demand. In 1991, for
example, the total take-up was 370,000 sq m, as the European Commission
searched for places to put 'fonctionnaires' displaced from its Berlaymont
headquarters by renovation work.
Last year, the European Parliament alone rented well over 200,000 sq m in
the glittering new Espace Leopold, complete with debating chambers and
conference halls. The addition of new members to the Community over the next
decade should maintain the momentum.
Mr Travers is keen to emphasise, however, that international institutions
are not the dominant players in the Brussels letting market. In fact, they
account for only 16 per cent of office occupation. The Belgian state (30 per
cent), international private sector (24 per cent) and Belgian private sector
(23 per cent) all have a bigger presence.
Last month, in one of Europe's largest deals, Pleiad Real Estate sold its
newly-built Tours Pleiad complex in Brussels to Belgacom, the telecoms
company, for Pounds 280m.
Rents will also continue to be underpinned by the strict urban planning
policy of Mr Charles Picque, minister-president of the Brussels-Capital
region, who is trying to limit the spread of purely commercial districts.
Professionals criticise him as a utopian, but simultaneously admit that such
a policy, while bad for developers, will always be good for investment and
rental values.
Outside Brussels, the main interest is in the retailing sector. Highlight of
this year's retail market is likely to be the opening on March 11 of
Belgium's biggest out-of-town shopping centre at Wijnegem, near Antwerp.
The importance of the development is not so much its size - 170 shops spread
over 37,000 sq m, plus an existing 14,000 sq m hypermarket - but the fact
that it has been allowed at all.
Special legislation dating back to 1975 and aimed at protecting independent
shopkeepers has allowed cities to veto such schemes. Partly as a result of
this policy, the growth of the chain store - motor of the in-town and
out-of-town retail market - has been limited in Belgium. With the opening of
Wijnegem, property professionals believe there is a chance that other
Belgian towns will be tempted to approve such developments, fuelling what is

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (8): Outdated lease laws due for
reform - Companies think the changes could take place within three to four
months / Portugal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN Lisbon city centre, ancient stucco peeling from buildings near ruin
contrasts sharply with massive construction sites and ultra-modern
developments nearing completion.
The striking differences highlight the complex condition of the Portuguese
property market, where outdated lease laws frighten away institutional
investors but a strong demand for offices and retail outlets has led to a
development boom.
The current lease laws provide tenants with perpetual security of tenure
without any open-market rent reviews. They also allow tenants to sell on
their lease, or 'trespasse', in a way that enables the new tenant to
maintain the same rent. This leaves landlords without the financial means or
incentive to refurbish or repair and results in the common sight of
dilapidated buildings that literally collapse with an alarming regularity.
Foreign property investors, unable to negotiate market-level rents or regain
possession for updating and refurbishing, have shied away from Portugal and
left the investment market almost dead.
However, the long-promised revision of commercial lease laws has finally
appeared on the horizon and property companies, although they have been
disappointed by government promises before, now believe the reforms could be
enacted within the next three to four months.
Drafts of the new law indicate that perpetual tenure will be replaced by
five-year, fixed-term contracts for retail lets and three-year fixed terms
for office rents. Rents would be renegotiated at market level at the end of
each period. At the same time the landlord would either be entitled to a
share of the capital or be able to renegotiate the rent when a 'trespasse'
was sold.
The investment market is expected to soar when this law changes. Companies
from Britain, the Netherlands, France and Spain are already showing a strong
interest as they wait in the wings for the climate to change.
'We hope the reform of the commercial lease laws will create the basis of a
true investment market in Portugal,' says Mr Eric van Leuven, managing
director in Portugal of Healey &amp; Baker, 'particularly as yields are so high
here compared with other European countries.'
Office building yields are at the level of 11-12 per cent, compared to about
4-5 per cent in Germany, for example. Yields will come down as the market
structure grows more normal and more rented office space becomes available.
Portugal experienced an office development boom between 1986 and 1991 after
joining the European Community. It enjoyed the fastest economic growth of
the 12 member states.
In the late 1980s, developers saw that there was hardly any supply and
started to acquire sites. Prices soared 30-50 per cent between 1986 and
1991. But in the wake of the growth, supply today surpasses demand. Top
prices have dropped some 10 per cent to about Es6,500 a sq m in the central
business district of Lisbon.
According to Mr van Leuven, demand has levelled off to a steady
60,000-70,000 sq m a year and is likely to remain at that level for the near
future. Estimated supply will be 85,000 sq m in 1993, 70,000 sq m in 1994
and 777,000 sq m in 1995 and beyond. 'Per capita rent is not that high,'
says Olle Arnoldsson, managing director of the Swedish property group Bygg
Fast in Portugal, 'if you consider that occupancy in Portugal is around one
person per 12 sq m compared with one person for 25 sq m in northern Europe.'
Despite this, he notes that office prices are at the same level as in
Stockholm or Frankfurt.
More and more companies such as Philips, Glaxo, L'Oreal, J Walter Thompson
and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi are planning to move to out-of-town business parks.
Three are already planned for easy-access locations on the motorways and
planned ring-road around the capital.
The Colombus Centre, a massive mixed development in Benfica, 15 minutes from
the centre of Lisbon, is presently in the marketing phase. The centre, which
is being developed by Sonae, Portugal's largest private entrepreneurial
group, will offer 56,000 sq m of prime office accommodation in twin towers.
It will also have 133,000 sq m of shopping, making it one of the most
extensive shopping areas in Europe. It will also make a claim to the best
sports and leisure complex in Lisbon.
'Retailers are very excited about the Colombus Centre,' says Mr van Leuven,
'and from that point of view it is a big success even before it leaves the
drawing board.' But the project could come up against financing difficulties
if the world economy continues to slow down.
Chiado, the old city shopping centre, part of which burnt down, is also
being developed as a mixed area of residential, office and retail property.
Financing has been helped by government loans.
Retail is the growth sector of Portugal's property market as the Portuguese
take their increased consumer power on a shopping spree. Leading retail
chains have already moved in and are expanding rapidly; others are in the
pipeline. Banks are also taking prime units and paying top prices.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (7): Political scandal casts a
shadow - There has been no sign yet of foreign investors even testing the
waters, in spite of a widespread view that the lira is now undervalued /
Italy
</HEADLINE>

CAPITAL values and rental prices have continued to slide in the
recession-hit Italian market as companies economise on their use of space
and new tenants remain few and far between.
Yet the sharp fall from the boom days of late 1990 has not so far teased out
new investors looking for property bargains, in spite of the fact that
yields are now drifting back into line with European averages. Moreover,
Italy's mushrooming political corruption scandal, which has struck down
cohorts of local and now national politicians, has cast a shadow over the
entire property scene, contributing to the lack of funds in the sale market.
Rental prices in central Milan have fallen by between 15 per cent and 20 per
cent from their peaks, reckons Mr Roberto Trella, managing director of
Richard Ellis in Italy. That translates to a top price today of L650,000 a
square metre in prestigious locations, compared with up to L800,000 at the
top of the market just over two years ago.
Even the current maximum price would only apply to the highest quality
space, with full services - something hard to find even in Milan. 'Even the
best-located offices don't always offer the quality international tenants
would expect', he says. 'Today, most deals are taking place between L500,000
and L600,000 per square metre.
'That means yields have now risen from about 5 per cent to between 6 per
cent and 6 1/2 per cent', says Mr Trella. 'They're likely to reach 7 per
cent by year-end, bringing them back to levels comparable to other European
centres'.
The situation in Milan also applies to Rome, the other big commercial
market, although prices tend to be a shade lower there. The recession has
also hit the Roman market slightly later than the big cities of the north.
The fact that the capital is sustained by the government's own heavy
property needs and the necessity for many companies and associations to be
present there has propped up demand somewhat, compared with Milan. But
although rentals in Rome are not expected to fall by as much as the northern
city, property specialists point out that they never rose as high as in
Milan in the first place.
It is a tougher tale in more peripheral locations in both cities, with
rentals having slumped. Some poorly-conceived, badly-planned modern
buildings in fringe locations, suffering from inadequate public transport
and poor local infrastructure, are struggling to find tenants. Rentals in
peripheral locations in Milan have dropped from a peak of L320,000 a square
metre to L220,000-L250,000 today, reckons Mr Trella.
However, the market is not moribund. Mr Carlo Puri, the managing director of
Milano Centrale Immobiliare, the Pirelli-owned property group which last
year signed a co-operation agreement with the UK's Knight Frank &amp; Rutley,
says there are still tenants for the right kind of space.
He has just signed up Siemens for 42,000 sq m in the ambitious Bicocca
development covering part of a former Pirelli plant to the north of Milan's
city centre in a deal worth about L200bn. Mr Puri expects to sign another
single tenant for a further 52,000 sq m shortly.
Such one-off transactions have not, however, lifted sentiment in an
otherwise gloomy market. 'Essentially, we are in a situation where there is
very little demand', says Mr Trella. 'And that demand which does exist is
very selective in terms of quality and location'.
As with some other forms of investment in Italy, last year's slide in the
value of the lira could offer a glimmer of hope in the property world.
Although foreign investors have traditionally treated the Italian market
with great caution, the currency's fall, combined with the decline in local
prices, could present attractive opportunities for non-Italian investors.
'When the political situation becomes more stable, we could become very
interesting for foreigners', says Mr Puri. So far, however, there has been
no sign of foreigners even testing the waters, in spite of a widespread view
that the lira is now undervalued.
Italian institutions are also extremely cautious. Insurance companies, which
own very large property portfolios, have been selling, but the disposals
have been largely restricted to the residential side, with the proceeds
reinvested in the core insurance business to help cover heavy underwriting
losses. Even bulk sales of residential property have been taking longer to
conclude owing to the noticeably less liquid market.
There is little to brighten the picture at present. Mr Puri draws some
comfort from the current political scandals, often linked to building
projects, which have helped to 'remove' - at least temporarily - some
players from the market. The elimination of such operators, who concentrated
on renting to public-sector bodies, could create new opportunities for
smaller companies, he reckons. However, in the depressed Italian market,
even such schadenfreude offers scant comfort.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (6): Overdue reforms now on the
way - There are at least two positive developments that could serve to
bolster the property market as it awaits a uniform recovery of the economy /
Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<TEXT>
TWO unfinished 24-storey office blocks that dramatically lean towards each
other as they span the northern end of Madrid's main artery, the Paseo de la
Castellana, sum up the situation of Spain's property market.
The towers, grandiosely named the 'Gateway to Europe', should have been
ready for tenants in May but nobody knows now when they will be completed.
Their owners, the property group Prima Inmobiliaria, which is linked to the
Kuwait Investment Office, went into receivership at the end of last year.
Recession is all-too evident in Spain and the real estate sector is deeply
caught in the rut. Rents began to fall two years ago and are still sliding.
In the peripheral areas of big cities, where business parks were cavalierly
planned just a short while ago, vacancy levels are above 25 per cent. The
drop in housing starts and in project approvals set in three years ago and
shows no sign of abating.
The towers were emblematic of the late 1980s boom in the domestic economy.
When work started on them, office rents along the Paseo de la Castellana
were nudging Pta6,000 a sq m. Flanked now by idle cranes, the 'Gateway to
Europe' is a testimony to a GDP growth rate that has slowed to a virtual
standstill. Rentals along Madrid's prestige artery are currently down to the
Pta4,000 level.
In the midst of such gloom, there are nevertheless at least two positive
developments that in the mid-term could serve to bolster the domestic
property market as it awaits a uniform recovery of the economy.
The first is a draft bill unveiled at the end of last year that aims to
liberalise rent controls which have been in place since the 1940s and
before. The longstanding regulation of rents, which was only partially
amended in 1985, demonstrably distorted the property market as much as the
economy as a whole.
It is estimated that some 70 per cent of Spanish tenants pay below-market
prices. On many a Spanish high street, recently-opened upmarket stores stand
oddly alongside old-fashioned businesses whose tied rents, at a huge
fraction of those of their neighbours, have been handed down through
succeeding generations.
The second development is a legislative package covering investment in the
real estate sector that offers generous tax incentives to funds especially
to those dealing in the housing sub-sector and in its rented segment.
Affordable housing is a political priority in Spain as elsewhere.
Under the terms of the rent liberalisation bill, leases for office and
commercial properties will be completely deregulated over an eight to
16-year period depending on the nature of the business and the period during
which the contract has been in force. The deregulation of housing rents will
be rather more gradual. Sitting tenants will be able to enjoy their strictly
controlled housing leases during their lifetime although they will no longer
be able to bequeath them to their descendants.
The bill has been enthusiastically welcomed by property companies which now
stand to gain considerable additional income as a portion of their returns,
which were effectively frozen, are boosted up to represent real market
values. Mr John Bain, of Healey and Baker, argues that it will also bring a
far greater stability to the market by eliminating the volatility created by
past discriminations.
There are a string of commercial enterprises, particularly European
Community-based ventures, that are queueing up to enter Spain but have so
far been barred from setting up by the lack of available space and by the
high price of the properties that did come onto the market.
The so-called Real Estate Investment Funds, which have still to get properly
off the ground, will clearly be so by the onset of deregulated rentals for
there are strong inducements for the funds to enter this segment of the
property sector.
The legislation states that funds which invest exclusively in rented
accommodation will be taxed at a rate of only 1 per cent, while those
investing 50 per cent of their assets in rented accommodation and the
remaining 50 per cent in other types of property will be taxed at 7 per
cent. Funds which avoid rented accommodation will be levied the standard
corporate tax of 35 per cent.
Ms Leonor Aresti, an analyst of Madrid securities firm FG, says that the
funds will deliver greater stability to the real estate sector by providing
a constant flow of investment which in turn will allow the formation of
reference prices. Valuations should be easier and price swings brought on by
speculation should be reduced.
Further stability will be ensured by the time scale - the legislation
suggests a four-year period - during which the funds must maintain the
properties they have purchased. The aim of this time period is to force the
funds to view rents as the source of their returns, rather than resale
capital gains. Since the funds will be seeking long-term returns from their
operations, they should be hesitant to invest during boom periods.
No legislation in the world can protect the real estate market from
recession but the long overdue initiatives now under way in Spain should
help contain some of the damage. The property market in Spain is all too
prone to boom and bust patterns because of its strict regulations and the
lack of stable funding. The initiatives should help to reduce the cyclical
nature of the business.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (5): Foreign buyers are treated
as saviours - Although German buyers have been active there is a huge
surplus of space, potential occupiers are nervous and values are likely to
continue falling / The UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

A London property deal earlier this year sums up the character of the UK
market at present. United Kingdom House, a single office block in Oxford
Street, was sold to an overseas investor for a huge discount. Buyer and
seller are reported to be congratulating themselves over a profitable deal.
About Pounds 1.2bn worth of UK property was taken by overseas investors last
year, according to DTZ Debenham Thorpe. The inflow of foreign money is less
than half that of a couple of years ago but with UK funds winding down
activity, any buyer is treated as a saviour.
Chesterfield Properties was probably none too happy about selling at almost
a fifth below book value, but the Pounds 85m it shared with a co-owner for
the 160,000 sq ft building was still almost twice what it paid in 1987. It
helped cut the company's gearing in half and boost the share price.
Other companies, such as Hammerson and Stanhope, have trodden the same path
for landmark buildings, and more are in the pipeline. Mr John Stephen of
property consultants Jones Lang Wootton figures that 70 per cent of the
London market could be absorbed this way in 1993.
The lion's share has gone to German buyers who are moving out of the strong
D-Mark since UK interest rates fell and the pound was devalued. With
long-term money at 8.5 per cent and yields as high as 10 per cent, deals
appear self-financing.
Overall property values dropped 10 per cent in the 12 months to January and
rents are down 15 per cent, according to Richard Ellis, the property
consultancy. Prime markets have been hit even harder, with capital values
down by almost a quarter in the City of London.
Things are beginning to look a little better as the supply pipeline dries
but values are likely to continue falling this year as a huge over-supply of
space hangs over the market and potential occupiers remain nervous of the
state the economy. In fact, they, along with UK institutions, remain far
more crucial to the market than a spate of overseas investors chasing an
ephemeral financial advantage.
Without domestic investment, the market will never recover, and British
funds have more than enough reason to continue their long-term withdrawal.
'Downsizing' is common, as managers switch big investments to smaller, more
liquid holdings. And the fashion for showing off good short-term performance
has led to sales which managers might never have contemplated years ago.
This again has opened opportunities for cash-rich foreign buyers. Shell
Pensions, for example, offloaded a 200,000 sq ft block on Victoria Street
for Pounds 70m to BfG, the German bank, while the Prudential picked up
Pounds 40m from PGGM of the Netherlands for 22 Hanover Square, which just
happens to be Mr Stephen's headquarters.
Not all money is coming from abroad, nor is it all aimed at the south-east.
Scottish Amicable partnered PGGM in the London deal and Mr Simon Ives of
Chesterton's points to sales of two Leeds buildings to Philips &amp; Drew fund
managers. But they all show that demand is tightly focused on strong initial
returns and quality occupiers. Development sites, empty and poorly-let or
badly located property attracts no-one. The Leeds blocks boasted yields of
about 9 per cent, good covenants and leases running for at least 15 years.
UK institutions were still net investors in the year to last September,
according to latest government figures extracted by Mr Fred Reeder at JLW.
They bought Pounds 3.8bn worth of property, compared with Pounds 2.4bn of
sales. But they could drop into net disinvestment by next year, adds Mr
Andrew Walker of Institutional Property Forecasting Services. He sees little
justification for buying when property is unlikely to outperform equities or
gilts over the next five years.
Managers are not all as pessimistic, however. Mr Alan Winter, who controls a
Pounds 2bn portfolio for Legal &amp; General, insists that his funds will buy
more property than they sell this year. Over the long-term, property still
outperforms other investments 'unless inflation is dead forever, and that
seems pretty unlikely.'
All this hinges, however, on two vital factors. The economy must improve so
occupiers will take up empty space and pay higher rents. That could be a
long, slow climb. Politicians must also resist calls to ban the long leases
and rent-review structures that attract both UK and overseas funds into
property.
Mr Ives sees the drift to occupier-friendly leases as an inevitable move
into line with the rest of Europe which is far more influential than
Maastricht. Only time will tell whether the institutions can live in such a
world; if not, the property market will need more than a few foraging German
buyers to carry it into the 21st century.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (4): Recession arrives - The
property market is now divided sharply between west and east / Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recession has at last caught up with Germany and its property markets, but
the effects are likely to be more subdued that in other leading
industrialised countries.
The recession has hit the Frankfurt office market hard - rents are down by
as much as 25 per cent on commercial property over the past 18 months and a
large amount of new office space is about to come on the markets as projects
initiated during better times come to fruition. Because there is already
overcapacity in the market, this is likely to put further pressure on rents.
Frankfurt rents increased by 15-25 per cent annually over the five years to
1991 and in 1991 letting reached a record level of 322,000 sq m. Vacancy
rates have risen to 7-8 per cent of the total supply. But several new
buildings, predominantly in the central financial district, are about to
come on stream and have not been fully let.
Like the country itself, the German property market is highly regionalised -
and is now divided sharply between west and east.
There are several large cities in the west which sustain important markets
of their own, including Dusseldorf, Munich, Hamburg, Cologne and Stuttgart.
While the Frankfurt market is driven by international investors and
international organisations - predominantly in financial services which
therefore makes it particularly vulnerable to the downturn - local factors
are more important for the other cities.
Despite the undoubted severity of western Germany's slowdown, it is from a
very high base and local property markets are bearing up or better -
predominantly because of a shortage of supply. While prime office rents
dropped by 21 per cent in Frankfurt in the year to December 1992, they had
climbed by 7 per cent in Hamburg, nearly 8 per cent in Munich, 16 per cent
in Dusseldorf and 25 per cent in Stuttgart.
It is unlikely that rents will hold this year as Germany experiences what
according to some economists will be its worst downturn since the Second
World War. But the environment is in general more stable than in other
countries. Germans are by nature more conservative than property speculators
elsewhere in the world - and German banks are more cautious lenders. A
relatively restrictive planning environment is another factor encouraging
cautious optimism about the future.
In the eastern part of Germany, a wholly different set of conditions apply.
The new Lander have to be completely rebuilt and there are enormous fortunes
to be made by those willing to take risks on the future development of
Berlin - with 3.4m inhabitants Germany's largest city and the future seat of
government - and cities such as Leipzig and Dresden.
The risks are as enormous as the opportunities at this stage: most
fundamentally it is not clear how much time it will take for a
self-sustaining economic revival to get underway in the east. At a more
nuts-and-bolts level, there are practical uncertainties - over rights to
land ownership, over planning rules, over liability for pollution and
contamination.
The Berlin market reflects some of the uncertainties. Zadelhoff Deutschland
calculates that before reunification the demand for office space ran at
50,000 sq m a year. Now, Zadelhoff says, the current vacancy rate is
virtually nil and unsatisfied demand stands at about 500,000 sq m. But there
is so much building activity going on at present that Zadelhoff predicts
that there may well be significant oversupply in the market by 1995-96.
Meanwhile, rents have gone from DM15-DM30 a sq m at the time of
reunification, to a peak of DM110 and back down to DM40-DM50 at present  -
without anything new being built or let.
In Dresden and Leipzig, the current supply of office space meets far less
than half of projected demand by the mid-1990s in both cases. Realignment of
supply and demand is not likely to take place until much later but initially
speculative rents are already starting to fall.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (3): Slowdown inflicts severe
damage - It is widely believed that 1993 will be one of the worst years but
the longer-term outlook may not be as bleak as the mood of the industry
might suggest / France
</HEADLINE>

THE Paris property market is enduring one of the steepest downturns of any
European market.
The slowdown in the economy, the rise in vacancy rates and the evaporation
of investment demand has forced a 20-30 per cent fall in office rents and an
estimated 40 per cent fall in capital values.
The severity of this decline has inflicted severe damage on property
companies and banks. Banks are slowly facing up to heavy provisions on their
FFr400bn portfolios, which could eventually average 15 per cent in the view
of Banque Paribas. Jones Lang Wootton, a firm of property advisers, goes
further. It expects the banks' total bill to exceed FFr100bn.
This predicament can, to a large part, be blamed on the banks' ambitious
lending policies at the end of the 1980s. After several years of impressive
returns from property, the French banks became increasingly competitive in
their desire to make property loans. This created steep inflation of asset
values, which was further stoked by a handful of large, highly-valued deals
by Japanese investors.
In addition, the banks financed a surge in construction of offices,
encouraged by the generally poor quality of the existing office stock.
Construction activity will peak this year at a level that many agents
believe will bring the amount of vacant office space in Paris to 4m sq m,
equivalent to a vacancy rate of about 10 per cent. Some experts, however,
believe this projection is exaggerated because some new developments are
being mothballed.
But even using more restrained projections of vacancy rates, it is clear
that there will be a glut of offices in Paris for several years. Past
experience suggests that it takes a year to fill 1m sq m of office space, if
the service sector grows at an annual rate of 4 per cent.
The recovery of the investment market will also be a slow process. While
agents believe that the institutions would be interested in buying good
quality property if the price was sufficiently low, there is no interest in
new, unlet developments or poor quality assets, which constitute a large
part of the banks' security.
Banks are reluctant to allow large property investors to go to the wall,
because of the fear that a series of forced sales would depress the market.
'The banks will do all they can to secure their long term investment,' says
Mr David Robinson of Richard Ellis, an agent.
The result is that banks are grappling with scores of complex
restructurings, which often involve taking possession of property assets. In
January, for example, Pierre Premier, a French property developer, was
forced to cede FFr3.2bn of its property holdings to its banks in order to
retain its independence.
Some banks, such as Paribas, say they will take several years before
disposing of these assets, perhaps through setting up a property company and
listing it on the stock market. In other cases, it seems likely that the
banks will attempt to dispose of the property as soon as they can, which
would provide an overhang of property that would continue to depress the
market.
Concern about the state of the property market prompted the government to
suggest some measures to alleviate the situation, after heavy lobbying from
banks and insurance companies. In late December, the government announced
plans to relax its agrement system which has tended to discourage occupiers
from taking up space in Paris, and some aspects of the property tax regime.
It was clear, however, that the government had no intention of bailing out
speculators and the measures were widely dismissed as cosmetic. 'The general
sentiment was 'Too little, too late'' says Mr Robert Lipscomb of Healey &amp;
Baker.
But despite the banks' calls for government intervention, the property slump
is not perceived to be a threat to the banking system.
'Overall, even if the problems are important as far as the level of reserves
are concerned, the size of the real estate portfolios are limited. Real
estate loans to professionals account for 8-10 per cent of the banks' total
loan portfolios,' says Mr Arnaud de Menibus, an executive vice-president of
Paribas.
Indeed, some players in the Paris property market wonder if the mood of
despondency is exaggerated. '1993 will probably be worse than 1992, but then
we could start seeing signs of recovery,' says Mr Lipscomb.
The problems of the letting market in Paris are less severe than in central
London where the office vacancy rate approaches 20 per cent.
Moreover, the French economy remains one of the strongest in Europe, despite
the strains inflicted by high real interest rates.
Although it is widely believed that 1993 will be one of the worst years on
record for the French property industry, the longer-term outlook may not be
as bleak as the mood of the French property industry might suggest.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (2): Reforms provoke a sluggish
reaction - The single market has changed the behaviour of investors in ways
that will inevitably affect property / Removal of trade barriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER

<TEXT>
THE arrival of a truly European property market is probably decades, if not
centuries, away.
Few large industries have been less affected by the removal of trade
barriers at the beginning of this year than property. The diversity of legal
regimes, tax systems and market practices across Europe, together with the
simple fact that property cannot be moved across borders, rules out most
attempts at standardisation.
Nonetheless, the lifting of trade barriers has changed the behaviour of
investors and occupiers in ways that inevitably affect property.
The impact of the single market initiative has been felt most directly in
the field of distribution property. Networks of European-wide distribution
parks are planned by groups such as Pan European Logistics, a UK-based
distribution specialist, and IDI Group Europe, a consortium of Gazeley
Properties of the UK, GA of France, Starke Deikstra of the Netherlands and
Travaux of Belgium.
The pattern of office demand could also change as companies take advantage
of a unified Europe. 'As national boundaries erode, cities will be competing
with each other to attract footloose investors and occupiers. The rules of
the game will change,' says Mr Nigel Roberts, a partner of Jones Lang
Wootton. This competition is illustrated by the rivalry between cities such
as London, Frankfurt, Paris and Brussels to attract the European Central
Bank.
Increasing attention has been focused on the relative merits of Europe's
large cities. 'In the context of Greater Europe, the credibility of the
notion of the continuing viability of 12 or more national capitals becomes
strained,' says JLW.
The largest capitals, in particular London and Paris, have a head start. A
recent survey of 530 senior executives in Europe for Healey &amp; Baker,
chartered surveyors, found that London, Paris, Frankfurt and, to a lesser
extent, Brussels and Amsterdam, scored better than other European cities as
the best locations for business.
But Europe's smaller capitals may grow faster than those which are already
established.
Taken together, London and Paris have accounted for a diminishing share of
Europe's office take-up: 54 per cent in 1986, 60 per cent in 1987, but only
43 per cent in 1991 and 1992.
The debate about the single market's influence on office demand is complex.
It has prompted fewer companies to develop grand strategic plans to
centralise their operations than expected a few years ago by many experts.
Indeed, in the view of some agents, the expectations of increased office
demand as a result of the single market initiative was misplaced. It has
prompted acquisitions and mergers rather than the establishment of many new
offices throughout Europe. Moreover, if it increases efficiency and reduces
bureaucracy it should, if anything, reduce the demand for offices.
As well as the shifting prominence of different capitals, the investment
markets have also undergone significant changes as a result of requirements
that governments relax investment restrictions on investing outside the home
market.
The relaxation of investment controls across much of Europe in the late
1980s prompted a wave of ill-fated diversification, particularly in the case
of Swedish investors. Their place has, to a small extent, been taken by
German investors, most of whom were restricted in their ability to invest
abroad before Spring 1991. They have invested heavily in London where they
have spent some Pounds 700m over the past 18 months.
German investors' enthusiasm for investing in London underlines how far off
Europe is from having a unified market. Many German funds find that
investing in the UK offers considerable tax advantages over, say, France and
Spain.
In addition, there are the attractions of the UK's idiosyncratic lease
structure, which has no equivalent in the rest of Europe.
Apart from German investment in London, pan-European property investment is
at a low ebb. Dutch funds and companies - which have long been enthusiastic
international investors - are considering further investments, particular in
Germany and Paris. However they are delaying investment until they consider
that those markets have hit the bottom.
The general slowdown in pan-European investment is largely due to the
problems that institutions have experienced in their existing investments.
In addition, potential investors are focusing on opportunities in their home
markets. 'The opportunities to pick up bargains in your own back yard is so
great that people are asking why take on the increased complexity and risk
from going overseas,' says a banker advising on international purchases.
While 1993 may be a year of enormous changes to Europe's businesses,
widespread recession has muted the impact of those changes on the property
market.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Survey of European Property (1): Some opportunities emerge -
But the downturn is also gathering pace. There is a sharp turnaround from
the prolonged, buoyant growth of the 1980s / Overview
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER

<TEXT>
A MOOD of pessimism and uncertainty has gripped Europe's main property
markets, where office values have fallen by nearly a quarter since the peak
of 1991.
But this gloom is, at times, lightened by opportunities that are emerging in
a period of change. The lifting of trade barriers at the start of 1993 and
the dismantling of the Communist system in eastern Europe may open up new
markets, stimulate competition between cities and encourage cross-border
investment.
Even the sharp adjustment of property values is throwing up opportunities
for contra-cyclical investors.
Not so long ago it seemed likely that most of Europe's property markets
would escape the downturns that afflicted the US and Japan. Two years ago,
when the property boom was a distant memory in London, Tokyo and New York,
continental Europe was a haven of stability.
Now the picture looks very different. With the exception of small pockets of
Europe, such as Belgium, the property downturn is rapidly gathering pace.
In the office sector, which has been worse hit than the retail sector,
values have fallen by 23 per cent, according to the Jones Lang Wootton
property index, which includes 14 cities from Berlin to Dublin.
The casualty list is topped by Stockholm and London where office values have
halved. Paris, where values are down by 40 per cent, and Madrid, have also
been badly hit. By comparison, Brussels, Berlin and some German cities -
such as Hamburg and Dusseldorf - have been relatively resilient.
This is a sharp turnaround from the prolonged, buoyant growth of the 1980s.
In the five years to 1990, steep increases in occupier demand, coupled with
low vacancy rates in most markets, stimulated strong rental growth averaging
14.4 per cent a year, according to Jones Lang Wootton (JLW). Capital values
rose even faster, at an average of 17.8 per cent a year. High expectations
about the lowering of trade barriers in 1992 further fuelled this inflation.
In the process, the hierarchy of Europe's office market was overturned.
Paris overtook London as Europe's most expensive office market. Rents in
Milan and Madrid rose beyond those of Brussels. Costs in the newly-emerging
markets of eastern Europe came from nowhere to be among the most expensive
in Europe.
The buoyancy of Europe's property values stimulated a surge in credit and
construction. In cities without rigorous planning controls this led to a
glut of new building and over-inflated asset prices.
Economic slowdown and high real interest rates hit these markets at a
vulnerable stage. Many countries have seen a sharp rise in office vacancy
rates, although - with the exception of the UK - these remain modest by US
standards. The average office vacancy rate in western Europe is more than 6
per cent, according to JLW.
Some commentators believe that, as property markets adjust to changed
economic conditions, the first into recession will be among the first out.
Markets such as Brussels, Milan and Frankfurt, which recently entered the
downward part of the cycle, are further from recovery than the London
property market which has been in recession for the past three years.
If measured by the take-up of office space, London peaked first (1987),
followed by Paris and Amsterdam (1989), Dublin, Lyon, Milan and Munich
(1990), Brussels, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Madrid in 1991, and
Barcelona and Berlin in 1992. Rental peaks generally lagged take-up peaks by
at least a year.
But the assumption that markets will recover in the same order as they went
into decline ignores the substantial differences between them. No two
property markets are entirely alike in their structure, legal systems,
planning laws, tax regimes, bank lending policies, and accessibility to
foreign investment.
The behaviour of banks has become one of the greatest influences on the
development of a country's property markets. The severity of the problems of
the Swedish, French and UK markets can largely be blamed on excessive bank
lending.
The banks are also determining the way in which the markets recover. In the
UK, hundreds of property companies have gone into receivership. In France,
banks are more likely to restructure ailing companies or take direct
ownership of their property. In Sweden, the scale of bad property debts has
forced the banks to assume responsibility for large portfolios of property,
which ultimately may have to be guaranteed by the government.
In Germany, by contrast, the banks' relatively cautious lending policies and
tight control over speculative developments is expected to temper the force
of the downturn, even though rents have already fallen by 25 per cent in
Frankfurt. The workings of the market may also influence the severity of the
downturn. Spanish rent controls, which are now being reformed, are believed
to have exaggerated the cyclical swings in the market.
Different lease structures also play a part. The 25-year leases that
characterise the UK property markets have stimulated some parts of the
investment market but added to the stagnation of the letting market.
Conversely, in Paris, shorter leases have encouraged tenants' mobility but
done nothing for the investment market, which has largely evaporated.
Another point of difference concerns the degree of international investment.
Inflows of money from overseas at the peak of the market tended to inflate
asset values, particularly in the case of Japanese buyers in Paris and
London who paid higher prices than domestic investors.
International investment can sometimes help iron out the troughs. In London,
for example, German investors have been notably active. But, on balance,
heavy international investment has tended to increase the volatility of
markets.
Any comparison of Europe's property industries must take into account the
maturity of the markets. The fledgling markets of eastern Europe operate
with different rules from those in the rest of Europe. In the west,
development schemes have been mothballed because of the excess of supply
over demand; in the east, development is being held up by planning disputes,
problems of land restitution and red tape. Only a few markets, such as
Budapest, Berlin and Vienna - which in some respects bridge the gap between
west and east - are in an active phase of development.
Taken as a whole, the upturn in Europe's property markets is some way off.
Generalisations about the markets should be treated with caution, however.
In Europe's worst-hit markets, it will take years to repair the damage of
the late 1980s. By contrast, activity in the most stable, or least mature,
markets may pick up rapidly once the economy returns to health.

FT  12 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Airtours raids Owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for control of Owners Abroad, Britain's second biggest holiday
tour operator, grew more heated as its smaller rival Airtours, which is
seeking to acquire Owners, picked up just over 4 per cent of the equity at
an average of 144p a share. Dealers said that Airtours' joint broker BZW had
been attempting to buy around 10 per cent of Owners shares, although a
spokesman for Airtours refused to confirm this. Owners shares closed 1 1/2
better at 141p in turnover of 13m. Airtours climbed 4 to 333p.
Rumours suggested further spice could be added to the takeover battle today
with the announcement by one leading institution over which side it will
support. Owners claimed yesterday that summer bookings were good, but
Airtours hand was further strengthened when Paribas became the latest broker
to support its Pounds 290m bid, joining Smith New Court, Hoare Govett and
Panmure Gordon.

FT  12 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy selling of Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market was stunned by the latest piece of bad news from Glaxo, the
drugs group whose second place in the London market's top 100 list by market
value is being seriously threatened by Shell Transport. Glaxo held the
number one spot in London for a number of months last year before being
overtaken by BT.
The resignation of Dr Ernest Mario, chief executive and deputy chairman, saw
London's marketmakers slash their dealing levels in Glaxo to head off any
huge selling pressure. The move was successful in the short term but failed
to prevent large scale selling and switching operations during the rest of
the session when the news had fully done the rounds of the big institutions.
Dr Mario's resignation comes only days after the shares were hit by
allegations that Glaxo's Zantac anti-ulcer drug has violated US drug laws.
Yesterday Glaxo shares began the session at 695p but collapsed to 652p as
the resignation news was made public. The stock rallied later in the
session, closing a net 19 off at 668p. Turnover in Glaxo expanded rapidly to
reach 24m, the highest-ever single day's business in the shares, just
topping the 23m traded in the middle of last month when the group announced
its interim figures.
Analysts were shocked by the latest news in what is viewed a series of
misfortunes that have dogged Glaxo. The shares peaked at 930p in 1992, but
rapidly lost favour with US funds. The most recent fears in the market have
been that the group may be seeking to raise cash via a mega rights issue to
fund a move into the US over-the-counter drugs market. Warner Lambert was
seen as the group's prime takeover target.
Some analysts took the view yesterday that the shares had further to fall.
'The market doesn't like intrigue and uncertainty and is taking a poor view
of recent events,' said one top drugs sector specialist. But leading
marketmakers said the recent steep fall in the share price 'provides an
outstanding buying opportunity in one of the market's top class stocks'.
Other leading drug stocks were beneficiaries of the switching out of Glaxo.
SmithKline Beecham raced up to close a net 17 higher at 491p and Wellcome
jumped 28 to 935p.

FT  12 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hold steady in brisk
turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-BUDGET caution was only disturbed on the UK stock market yesterday by
company announcements and by the disturbing news that the London Stock
Exchange has abandoned Taurus, its plan for a paperless settlement system of
securities deals. Member firms of the London Exchange, which are believed to
have already spent around Pounds 350m on the project, reacted strongly to
the Taurus decision, questioning whether the resignation of the chief
executive of the Stock Exchange fully allayed their alarm. Overseas-based
securities firms, in particular, expressed strong criticism of the
exchange's behaviour.
Equities opened steadily but market indices were hurt by the unexpected
resignation of the chief executive of Glaxo, once the market's favoured drug
stock but a significant under-performer in London over the past six months.
Nervousness was emphasised by the prospect that Wall Street, also a strong
player in Glaxo shares, had yet to make its response to the news.
Heavy trade in Glaxo made up nearly 3 per cent of the day's total, with the
rest of the drug sector also active as several London brokers advised
clients to switch into other leading pharmaceutical names. However, not all
the advice was negative; some analysts shrugged off the boardroom news,
pointing out that Glaxo was probably less likely to make a rights issue in
the wake of the latest developments.
However, the setback in Glaxo's share price was responsible for more than
three points of the day's fall of 3.3 points in the FT-SE Index, which
closed at 2,953.4. The important Footsie 2,950 mark was lost again in early
trading when the Index fell by 14 points, so analysts were left to make up
their own minds as to whether the market was sound at present levels.
Seaq volume was brisk, with the day's total of 822.3m shares, comparing with
687.5m on Wednesday. Non-Footsie business made up around 65 per cent of the
day's total trading. Retail volume in equities has remained high this week,
and was worth Pounds 1.61bn on Wednesday.
The disclosure of a substantial loss, dividend cut and workforce layoffs by
Rolls-Royce had been to a large extent foreseen in the stock market. A
higher payout from Enterprise Oil offset lower profits and left the oil
exploration sector little moved. In terms of the effect on the FT-SE Index,
weakness in Glaxo was counterbalanced by gains in other drug stocks and also
in ICI.
Market firms continued to focus on reducing commitments ahead of the end of
the equity trading account today and the Budget speech from Mr Norman
Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, on Tuesday. The stock market
believes that the chancellor will avoid any strong moves towards tightening
taxation at this stage.
In particular, no changes in corporate taxation are expected next week, and
the domestic question of tax relief on mortgage interest payments is thought
unlikely to be addressed at this stage. A further modest reduction in UK
base rates is regarded as virtually certain, although for the longer term,
there is still a question over the implications for inflationary pressures
of the substantial devaluation of sterling since mid-September.

FT  12 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chief executive's resignation at Glaxo along with continued nervous
trading ahead of next week's Budget unsettled the futures, leaving it to
trade in a narrow range, writes Joel Kibazo.
The early buying of the March contract on the FT-SE, which saw it move 7
ahead to 2,967 shortly after the market's opening, was led by independent
traders. However, consideration of the announcement from Glaxo caused a
turnaround in the fortunes of the contract and by 9.30am it had fallen to
2,942.
A period of sideways trading then followed which saw the contract trading
between 2,947 and 2,960 for the rest of the day with some buying over the
lunchtime period being the reason for the rise to the 2,960 level.
The weakness in gilts and the German markets was also cited as a reason for
the dull trading, while in the afternoon Wall Street had no impact. March
finished at 2,950, 8 below its previous close and at a discount to the
underlying cash market. Turnover was unimpressive at 8,373 lots.
Volume in the traded options was high, with a significant contribution
coming from BTR. The day's total came to 48,414 lots with 8,270 contracts
dealt in the FT-SE 100 option.
The Euro FT-SE 100 contract was particularly busy with 9,160 lots recorded.
In the stock options, BTR saw hefty business of 9,843 lots.

FT  12 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets fall on weak jobs
claims data

Wall Street
AFTER three days of record-setting gains, US share prices fell yesterday in
the wake of disappointingly weak jobs figures, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.34 at 3,457.00.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 2.32 lower at 454.01,
while the Amex composite finished 0.43 firmer at 422.31, and the Nasdaq
composite up 1.41 at 694.28. Trading volume was 252m shares.
The tone of the day was set from the start by the weekly jobs claims data
which showed that during the final week of last month the number of people
claiming state unemployment insurance jumped by 25,000, a much bigger
increase than analysts had expected.
Not only did the figures suggest that the labour market remains depressed in
spite of the recent improvements in economic growth, but they also cast
doubt over last week's unexpectedly strong February employment figures in
which non-farm payrolls soared by 350,000 over the month.
In light of the data, analysts predicted a significant downward revision in
the February employment numbers when the March report is released early next
month. On an brighter note, the Commerce department announced that retail
sales rose 0.3 per cent in February, or 0.9 per cent excluding motor vehicle
sales. Economists had predicted a small decline in total sales.
Among individual stocks, some of the biggest cyclicals, which led the recent
record-breaking rally, ran into profit-taking and renewed nervousness about
the outlook for economic growth. International Paper fell Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 64 5/8 , Alcoa tumbled Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 70 7/8 , and General
Motors slumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 38 1/2 . Some computer stocks,
meanwhile, were in mixed form. Compaq, which earlier this week slashed
prices on a range of its best products, rose more than Dollars 1 early on
before slipping back to end up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 50 5/8 and Motorola
gained Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 64, but IBM dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 54
7/8 and Hewlett-Packard eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 78.
National Semiconductor jumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 12 7/8 in volume of
2.5m shares after the company reported fiscal third quarter net income of 19
cents a share, up from 11 cents a share a year earlier.
Glaxo fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 18 7/8 in volume of 4.8m shares on the news
that Mr Ernest Mario, the UK drug group's chief executive, had resigned. On
the Nasdaq market, Sun Microsystems was the big story of the day, plunging
Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 32 1/4 in volume of 6m shares after two analysts,
at Goldman Sachs and Dean Witter, said they were worried about the company's
order levels in the current quarter.
Canada
TORONTO stock prices closed flat in heavy trading. According to preliminary
data, the TSE-300 index closed up 0.43 points, or 0.01 per cent, at
3,552.42. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 359 to 283. Volume was
65.787m shares, up from Wednesday's 54.449m, and trading value rose to
CDollars 573m from CDollars 535.1m.

FT  12 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average records
fifth straight gain
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING slowed ahead of the settlement of stock index futures and options
today, but the Nikkei average posted its fifth consecutive gain on buying by
foreign investors and public funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed up 46.16 at 17,904.79 after a day's low of
17,735.43 and a high of 18,104.65. Rumours of political unrest in Russia
briefly depressed prices in the afternoon, but late position adjusting by
arbitrageurs supported the index.
Volume fell to 450m shares from 541m, while gainers led losers by 532 to
471, with 153 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
rose 2.46 to 1,344.34 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.24 to
1,085.16.
Investors were encouraged by the market's longest consecutive gain since
last November. While some corporate investors were seen liquidating tokkin,
or specified money trusts, buying by public funds added support.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y5,000 to Y795,000. Analysts said that
the share price had advanced due to a low liquidity position in the stock,
and was now being traded like a speculative issue by dealers. Some 60 per
cent of the 5.4m shares are held by individual investors, who do not trade
the issue, and 20 per cent by financial institutions, which are stable
shareholders.
However, the increase in tariffs, expected later this year, will allow NTT
to increase capital investments in digitalised systems. 'NTT is one of the
cheapest telecom companies in leading stock markets by valuation,' said Mr
Eric Gan at Kleinwort Benson.
Companies with close links to NTT also gained ground: Iwatsu Electric rose
Y51 to Y477, Daimei Telecom Engineering put on Y23 to Y742 and Nippon Comsys
rose Y30 to Y785.
The recent rally in the formerly state-owned NTT has boosted interest in
Japan Railway related shares, as a rise in the telecom company's shares will
pave the way for the listings of other public corporations. The government
is expected to launch stock sales of JR East and Japan Tobacco during the
next fiscal year to March 1994.
Tekken, a construction company with close ties with the Japan Railway group,
gained Y24 to Y824, while Nippon Signal, the railway signal maker, rose Y10
to Y1,400.
Steel companies fell on profit-taking: NKK, which announced a restructuring
programme on Wednesday, including a 15 per cent cut in workers, fell Y11 to
Y260, while Nippon Steel eased Y1 to Y317.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 68.68 to 18,834.22 in volume of 70.1m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, improved Y100 to Y10,100.
Roundup
POLITICS played an important role in affecting Pacific Rim markets.
HONG KONG lost ground as fund raising exercises announced on Wednesday
encouraged profit-taking.
But the market picked up from the day's lows, encouraged by news that Mr
Chris Patten, the governor, had delayed a key address to the colony's
legislature while Britain considered an approach from China on possible
talks.
The Hang Seng index finished 116.62 or 1.8 per cent lower at 6,372.37 after
pulling up from the day's low of 6,300.55.
HSBC Holdings, due to announce results next Monday, topped the active list
and dropped HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 68.50. Cathay Pacific shed 5 cents
to HKDollars 9.80 after it reported higher net income for last year.
AUSTRALIAN shares continued their strong run after higher unemployment
figures were seen to improve the prospects for an opposition win in
tomorrow's federal election. The All Ordinaries index closed 13.7 up at
1,661.1 in turnover of ADollars 373.1m.
The day's star performer was tobacco group WD &amp; HO Wills, which rose 45
cents or 22 per cent to ADollars 2.50 after posting a 250 per cent increase
in net profit on Wednesday. Brambles climbed 12 cents to ADollars 16.16.
TAIWAN rebounded as late bargain hunting improved sentiment after the heavy
profit-taking seen early this week. The weighted index added 144.98 or 3.2
per cent to 4,619.38 in active turnover of TDollars 65.2bn.

FT  12 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Portuguese equities aim to catch up
with bonds - Lisbon is more hopeful for 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER WISE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although Lisbon's BTA index has fallen back from a 1993 peak of 1,779 at the
end of last month, closing yesterday at 1,692, investors still hope that the
subdued Portuguese bolsa could shine in 1993.
Mr Jose Carlos Pestana Teixeira, managing director of the Lisbon stock
exchange, says: 'There is enough confidence in companies, confidence in the
market, confidence in the economy and confidence in the currency for a
marked recovery.'
The market could do with a boost. The BTA index has fallen more than 50 per
cent since its last peak in October 1989 when it reached 3,705. Small
investors, scalded by the 1987 crash in global equities, have never returned
and the stock exchange has not been the market choice for companies to raise
capital.
Bonds, however, have risen sharply, particularly since the introduction last
year of primary dealers, who underwrite and market issues, with bond trading
accounting for 80.50 per cent of total turnover on the stock exchange last
year. But shares languished, with the BTA index falling 17 per cent on the
year.
Analysts believe that the elements are in position for at least a moderate
turnround. Government claims that the Portuguese economy is an 'oasis' in
Europe may be far-fetched, but forecast GDP growth of 1.8 per cent in 1993
will still put the country above the European average, expected to be well
under 1 per cent.
Until now, says Mr Rocha Correia, of brokers Independente, the Portuguese
stock market has reversed the text book rules and fallen significantly while
the economy improves; it has also shown itself perverse by falling in
parallel with interest rates. Market watchers are now hopeful that these
trends will revert to normal, bringing more activity back to the share
market.
Agreement at the Edinburgh summit to double EC funds for the four poorer
members - Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal - will pump more money into
the country for badly-needed infrastructure.
'This makes the construction sector an obvious choice for investors,' says
Mr Jose Peixoto of Totta Dealer. 'But competition is fierce, especially over
price, and investors should exercise careful selectivity within the sector
for companies with sound finances.'
In this context, some engineering and metallurgical companies are also
coming to the fore: Somague, Engil and Celcat being mentioned.
Another key sector to watch, according to Mr Jose Fonseca Goncalves,
financial analyst of Totta Dealer, is banking, particularly the big three:
Banco Comercial Portugues, Banco Totta e Acores and Banco Portugues de
Investimento. In fact, it was the better than expected performances by these
banks in 1992 that spurred January's rise in the index.
Distribution is a third sector where companies are succeeding as the
Portuguese grow more affluent. 'As there are no food companies quoted in
Portugal, distribution is a good investment for a situation in which wages
are rising and inflation falling,' says Mr Fonseca Goncalves.
Another important factor working in favour of the market has been the first
full year of use of the reforms that constituted Portugal's 'big bang' in
September 1991.
The 1991 reforms introduced two unlisted securities markets in Lisbon and
Oporto for small and medium sized companies.
Continuous trading has expanded from an original three companies to 59.
Eventually all companies listed on the main market, some 200, will be
brought in, and the dealing timetable will be extended to allow US investors
to intervene directly in the Lisbon market.
But the key benefit continuous trading has brought is greater transparency
and liquidity,' says Mr Pestana Teixeira. 'It is proving a vital tool in the
recovery of the market and is bringing about a dramatic change.'

FT  12 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Stockholm shaken by political
turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER political drama in Moscow unnerved early trading but activity was
generally mixed yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
STOCKHOLM was shaken by the prospect of a political crisis of its own
provoking an early election and shares staged a sharp retreat from the
opening. But as tensions eased throughout the day, prices picked up leaving
the Affarsvarlden index 2.5 lower at 1,026.0.
Mr David Longmuir of James Capel in London said the day's events had left
the market 'jittery'. He expected investors to pay closer attention to the
state of the Swedish economy, and in particular how much further domestic
interest rates could be expected to fall.
ABB was unchanged at SKr438 after reporting slightly lower 1992 profits,
while Volvo dipped SKr6 to SKr400, having traded as low as SKr387, as it
reported a record loss and cut its dividend for the first time.
Stora was SKr9 lower at SKr310 after announcing a loss and halving its
dividend, but Trelleborg firmed SKr3 to SKr61 ahead of its results after the
close.
FRANKFURT kept its eye on Bayer as the group cut its dividend by the
expected DM2 to DM11, underpinning its premium to BASF and Hoechst and
leaving the shares DM2.80 higher at DM279.80. Hoechst was flat at DM256, and
Bayer 70 pfg lower at DM239.80 as the DAX index rose 7.72 to a new 1993 high
of 1,717.40. Turnover eased from DM7.8bn to DM7.6bn.
Allianz rose DM28 to DM2,376, rebounding after last week's disappointment
with results from its German property and casualty insurance business.
The most consistently strong sector was construction, as Bilfinger, Hochtief
and Holzmann rose DM21 to DM1,007, DM33 to DM1,235 and DM54 to DM1,140 on
stories that a special fund was being set up to invest in the German
construction and property industries.
In engineering, KHD went ex-rights and fell a net DM3 to DM89.50. Mr Adrian
Hopkinson at NatWest Securities said that KHD had also produced a
disappointing progress report this week, which noted a severe fall in the
order intake for its agricultural machinery, especially tractors, and
forecast a break even in 1993 when analysts had expected something better,
after extensive rationalisation over the past three years.
PARIS was moderately weaker in a day's trading lacking direction or
enthusiasm. The CAC-40 index closed 3.48 higher at 1,988.94, in turnover of
FFr2.6bn.
Among Wednesday's gainers Chargeurs fell back FFr31 to FFr1,250 on
profit-taking, a factor which also characterised Lafarge's FFr3.50 fall to
FFr354.
Thomson-CSF weakened FFr1.60 to FFr159.60 in spite of announcing a FFr100m
order while financials were mixed, with UAP down FFr11 at FFr583 and SocGen
FFr12 firmer at FFr644.
MILAN edged higher in technical trade before the end of the March account
next Monday and the Comit index rose 4.06 to 520.71.
Sentiment was hurt by news that a parliamentary committee had refused to
give precedence to a government decree unblocking public works contracts
frozen because of the corruption scandal.
Among construction companies hit by the news, CogefarImpresit fell L30 to
L2,730 while Premafin, which fixed L270 ahead at L6,220 fell back to L6,180
after hours.
Elsewhere, Sip, the telecommunications group rose L12 to L1,660 after a
newspaper suggested, correctly in the event, that the board could decide on
a capital increase later in the day.
Ferruzzi Finanziaria rose L7 to L1,306 ahead of its confirmation, after the
market closed, that it was negotiating to sell a controlling stake of its
Erbamont pharmaceutical company to Sweden's Kabi-Pharmacia.
ZURICH finished slightly firmer at a record closing high, though below the
day's peak. The SMI index added 7.2 to 2,164.4. Pharmaceuticals were back in
fashion as worries waned that plans for healthcare reform in the US would
severely hurt Swiss groups. Ciba-Geigy bearers firmed SFr10 to SFr619.
BBC Brown Boveri bearers recovered from early losses to close SFr30 higher
at SFr4,070. Earlier the share fell as low as SFr3,970 after ABB, from which
BBC derives most of its income, announced its 1992 results. However, the
price recovered as investors noted that ABB had reduced its net debt to
zero.
AMSTERDAM remained relatively resilient with a 0.4 gain in the CBS Tendency
index to 105.8. Some investors chose to take profits in DSM which has been a
strong performer recently, the shares closing Fl 2.80 lower at Fl 80.60.
OSLO remained strong as the all-share index closed at a new 1993 high, up
4.2 at 435.8 in turnover of NKr407.4m.
ISTANBUL fell 3.6 per cent, closing 209.51 lower at 5,654.58 for a two-day
drop of 4.7 per cent on worries over higher bond rates and rising demand for
the lira.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Rates dip briefly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNCERTAINTY in the run up to Tuesday's UK Budget created a generally
quiet day on the London money markets yesterday, in spite of an early dip in
three-month interbank rates.
Prospects for fiscal tightening in the budget prompted a surge in optimism
in the morning, bringing the three-month interbank rate down to 5 7/8 per
cent on the offered side. However, it later rose in the afternoon, and ended
unchanged at 5 15/16 per cent on the offered side. Further out, six-month
money closed barely changed at 5 1/2 per cent.
Dealers said that the intra-day movement was partly due to generally easy
liquidity. Although the Bank of England had initially forecast a fairly
large shortage of Pounds 1.8bn, later revised to Pounds 2bn, then Pounds
1.9bn, this was successfully taken out early in the day.
However, other dealers said that rising hopes that the chancellor would
present a tight budget next week, coupled with recent interest rate cuts in
Europe, were also creating a more optimistic mood.
'You take your chances, but the hopes are all there in the markets right
now,' said one dealer.
Although three-month short sterling futures bounced ten basis points higher
early in the day, they closed barely unchanged at 94.52.
In continental European markets, German and French futures remained broadly
stable, although French Pibor futures closed slightly down at 91.54.
In spite of the recent cuts in the German repo rate, the Bank of France
yesterday announced that its own securities repurchase rate would be left
unchanged at 9.10 per cent. This provoked little surprise in the markets in
light of the franc's position near its ERM floor, and the ongoing political
uncertainty in the run-up to the French elections.
Nevertheless, opinions remained mixed about the likelihood of further rate
cuts across Europe. Earlier this week, the Dutch, Belgian and Danish
authorities followed the Bundesbank's monetary easing with rate cuts of
their own. Although one dealer claimed that 'the trend is now definitely
downwards,' another pointed out that political uncertainty over the
solidarity pact discussions in Germany could deter the Bundesbank from
cutting its rates next week.
'I think we've had all the rate cuts that we're going to get,' said another
dealer. He added that the Bank of Spain was unlikely to cut rates today.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Russian crisis shakes D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS THAT the political situation in Russia could be deteriorating caused
the D-Mark to slip on the currency markets, writes Gillian Tett.
As news of the uncertainty trickled through yesterday morning, the dollar
bounced sharply higher against both the D-Mark and the yen, reaching a high
of DM1.6703.
However, a mixed set of US economic figures eventually calmed the dollar's
rise, and by the end of the day it had fallen back to DM1.6610, down
slightly on the previous day's close of DM1.6645.
The US February retail figures had been slightly better than expected,
showing a 0.3 per cent rise against flat market forecasts. However, these
were offset by the announcement of a rise in weekly unemployment claims
which caused some uncertainty about the strength of the US recovery.
Nevertheless, many dealers expect the dollar to continue its upward trend
against the D-Mark, which is perceived to be the currency most closely tied
to the fortunes of the former Soviet Union.
'Generally speaking the dollar has been fairly strong all round. The events
in the former Soviet Union have just been a catalyst,' said Mr Gerard Lyons
of DKB International. He said that the key question for the dollar in the
weeks ahead was whether it could break through the DM1.6800 level.
In early US trading, the dollar drifted lower with dealers in New York
disappointed by the poor jobless figures and with worries about the crisis
in Russia insufficient to sustain an upward drive.
Concern about the D-Mark also boosted the Swiss franc, which has been
steadily rising against the German currency all week. By the end of the day
it closed at DM0.917.
'The Swiss franc has been a clear winner this week,' commented Mr Jim
O'Neill of Swiss Bank, who calculates that it has risen by 1 per cent in
value against the D-Mark since Monday.
Trading in sterling remained fairly quiet, with the London markets in limbo
ahead of the UK budget.
'Its not exactly a day for sterling,' said Mr Lyons, who said that he
expected the currency to remain largely steady until the Budget on Tuesday.
An early rise in the pound against the D-Mark was stalled after the release
of the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trade survey got a
mixed response from the markets. In the afternoon, sterling dipped to close
unchanged on the day at DM2.3850.
Meanwhile the lira continued to slide. It closed at L966.0 against the
D-mark, from a previous close of L961.50.
With the G7 meeting scheduled for today, and the British Budget due next
week, dealers warned that the markets could move rapidly in the coming
weeks.
'Everyone is waiting for the big events next week,' explained Mr O'Neill.

INDIA, THE world's biggest tea producer, hopes to widen the market for its
green tea through the adoption the CTC (crush, tear and curl) manufacturing
method previously confined to black tea.
Green tea is traditionally produced by the orthodox method which is
cumbersome, expensive and somewhat unhygienic.
It has now been commercially established, however, that the processing cost
is nearly halved if it is manufactured the CTC way. The cuppage is increased
by about three times and tasters have confirmed that CTC green tea produces
excellent liquor and has an appetising green colour.
Essels Tea, which owns gardens in north Bengal, will be marketing CTC green
tea internationally for the first time in the present season.
Almost all the 8m kg of green tea produced annually in India is exported.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: IPE may launch natural gas
contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL Petroleum Exchange has set up a task force to consider the
introduction of a natural gas futures contract as the UK opens up its gas
market.
'I can see that natural gas could be an important contract for us when
Europe gets to the point of trading it freely,' said Mr Peter Wildblood,
chief executive of the exchange.
But gas futures trading is unlikely to become a reality for another five
years given the absence of an underlying market - gas is now bought and sold
on the basis of producer contracts.
The New York Mercantile Exchange developed the first market for natural gas
derivatives trading three years ago on the back of de-regulation in the US
gas industry.
The IPE and Nymex are discussing co-operation in several areas including the
establishment of a cross-margining link between the two markets. 'The
exchanges are inter-dependent and we are looking at areas for co-operation
which would benefit the market as a whole,' said Mr Wildblood.
IPE trading volume has increased by 41 per cent so far this year. Last
year's volume reached 35,000 contracts.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India plans for bigger sugar
exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA, THE world's largest producer of sugar, has launched an effort to
increase its exportable surplus by offering a package of incentives to sugar
factories and cane growers.
Starting next month the federal government will create a sugar buffer stock
of 500,000 tonnes, the maintenance cost of which will be met from a sugar
development fund built from a levy of Rs14 (30p) a quintal (100 lb) on the
country's production.
The industry is calling, however, for a buffer stock of 1m tonnes.
The new policy confirms that India intends to be a regular exporter of sugar
and that exports will be handled by the Indian Sugar &amp; General Industry Exim
Corporation, an organisation jointly funded by the private and co-operative
sugar mills. The old policy of exporting sugar only in years of local
abundance is being given up.
In the ten months to January India exported 321,000 tonnes of sugar.

GOLD'S bounce from Wednesday's lows continued with an afternoon fix at
Dollars 326.90 a troy ounce, up 25 cents, as the market tested prices over
Dollars 327. The market took some strength from the firmer tone in platinum
group metals and silver and found further support from commission house
buying, traders said. The tone generally reflected optimism that having
resisted a drop through Dollars 326 overnight, a move back to Dollars 328
could be maintained. Even so, rand and Australian dollar equivalent prices
remain attractive to producers and selling will slow the recovery.
Three-month COPPER pushed above resistance around Dollars 2,170 a tonne on
the London Metal Exchange, helped by steadier levels in New York, although
there appeared to be stiff resistance developing near Dollars 2,180, an old
support level. Dealers said the sluggish European market is being offset by
a positive Comex, with US physical demand said to be in good shape and the
LME arbitrage premium narrowing.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Slide in cocoa prices continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA PRICES were continuing to fall yesterday on further bouts of
liquidation sparked by the failure of last week's talks in Geneva on
renewing the International Cocoa Agreement.
The London May contract closed yesterday at Pounds 676 a tonne, down Pounds
11 on the day and Pounds 86 below the recent high struck two weeks ago
during the Geneva talks. At the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange
the May delivery contract was recovering in late trading from an earlier low
of Dollars 841 a tonne.
Next week delegates to the International Cocoa Organisation meet in London
for their biannual council meeting. They are hoping to close the gap between
consumers and producers so that they can return to Geneva for more
negotiations on the pact, which expires at the end of September and cannot
be extended.
The two sides have been able to agree only that a maximum of 350,000 tonnes
of cocoa should be withheld from the market. They have not been able to
agree on how such a withholding scheme should be financed, nor on the price
range which an agreement should defend.
The drift in prices this week illustrates the disillusionment of the trade
with the endless talks. Profit-taking by a few speculators who were gambling
on the talks succeeding then turned into technical selling as chart support
levels were breached.
'There has been long liquidation by the speculators, the trade, the funds
and the industry,' said Mr Tony Chadwick of Prudential Bache yesterday. The
situation had been made worse by the fact that the market had absorbed a lot
of selling from producer countries while at the higher levels.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, said that market perceptions of the
Ivory Coast's crop were becoming clearer. Despite quality restrictions, the
main crop would still be large, he suggested. A big question remark remained
over the mid-crop - usually about 100,000 tonnes - which the Ivory Coast has
said it will not sell.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG's mining adviser offers
'bridge' to foreign investors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR ROBERT Needham, whose appointment as mining adviser to Papua New Guinea's
new government is creating considerable controversy, yesterday gave some
indications about how he intended to operate in future. He said the Mineral
Resources Development Company, which will hold the PNG government's stakes
in natural resource companies and of which he is managing director, would
not be a passive partner but 'will look closely at all operations to see if
they can be improved.
'We are there to ensure that the government gets the best deal possible for
its stake in the major developments,' he explained. 'In order to do this
MRDC will also attempt to ensure that the profits of each operation that it
invests in are maximised.'
Mr Needham, an Australian, was once chief executive of Placer Pacific, the
company at present in dispute with the PNG government over Porgera, a gold
mine in which the government wants to increase its shareholding. When it was
suggested that his appointment had caused the friction over Porgera, he
likened his position to that of a lawyer who had given good advice to a
client only for the client's opponents to say: 'Hang the lawyer'. The PNG
government was being underestimated, he said - 'They make up their own
minds'.
Mr Needham faced a series of hostile questions after speaking at the
Australian Gold Conference and defending PNG's record in the areas of
sovereign risk, access to land, social and civil unrest and bureaucracy. He
recalled that it had long been PNG government policy to take up to 30 per
cent of the equity in any major developments too large for PNG companies.
The level of equity taken up would depend on the economics of individual
projects. MRDC should 'be viewed as a partner in these projects that can
help foreign companies obtain access to mineral resources and at the same
time provide the necessary bridge for communications with government'.
MRDC was recruiting a team of about 25 analysts, geologists and mining
engineers and would also promote the development of local small mining
companies by paying for equity stakes in them. Mr Needham was asked if the
giant Lihir Island project, involving one of the world's biggest gold
deposits, was 'on hold'. He said that the licence application submitted by
the joint venturers, RTZ Corporation and Nuigini Mining, was 'full of
qualifications they have set themselves. Until these qualifications have
been addressed, it is not really an application'.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Western Australia aims to boost
onshore oil and gas production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN AUSTRALIA is to boost onshore oil and gas production by offering
more flexible royalty packages and other incentives to small and
medium-sized exploration companies, according to Mr George Cash, the state's
new Minister for Mines and Lands.
He said yesterday that he had instructed his department to confer with the
oil industry to see what the new coalition government could do to encourage
more exploration but already he had some ideas to put forward.
For example, exploration costs might in future be offset against royalties
on specific areas or wells. At present royalties paid to the state ranged
between 5 and 10 per cent of oil produced and there was no provision for
them to be waived. This problem could be overcome by setting the royalty
rates between zero and 15 per cent.
Deferring royalty payments for five years to help companies' cash flow might
also be considered and there might be accelerated depreciation, enabling
exploration companies to write off plant and equipment over one year instead
of five to 15 years.
There could be special help for companies operating in particularly remote
areas. All or any of these things could be put into individual packages
tailored to help specific companies.
Mr Cash, in Kalgoorlie to attend the Australian Gold Conference, suggested
more exploration might be encouraged if the state also cut red tape by
eliminating the ADollars 3,000 (Pounds 1,475) charge for permit applications
and other charges, which could add up to ADollars 20,000 a year for permits
to explore.
He said he did not expect the state's revenue to suffer. 'The state should
gain in the end,' he said, 'because you don't get revenue unless there are
holes in the ground and this should encourage more holes to be drilled.'
Mr Cash hoped the industry would reflect on these suggestions and let his
department know its views. He had asked the department to report back in six
weeks and expected to have legislation before parliament before the end of
this year. Separately, Western Australia wanted to renegotiate the resource
rent tax, which at present saw oil companies paying all the tax on revenues
generated by wells outside Australia's coastal waters to the federal
government. Mr Cash said it was estimated that Western Australia was
foregoing revenue totalling ADollars 600m from two new discoveries, BHP's
Griffin and Ampol's Wandoo.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals prices seen 'drifting'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASE METAL prices will drift near their present depressed levels this year,
Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the world's biggest mining
company, predicted yesterday. Speaking at the announcement of RTZ's 1992
results, he said that while the US economy appeared to be on the road to
recovery, the German and Japanese economies were not. Western Europe and
Japan account for roughly half the Western World's consumption of
non-ferrous metals.
'Even with the US recovery gathering momentum, therefore, prices of metals
and mineral are unlikely to depart far from their present trading ranges
until late in the year at best.'
However, he believed the minerals industries were well placed to benefit
when Europe and Japan emerged from recession. 'Prices should react more
quickly to economic recovery than they did in the 1980s, even if that
recovery is sluggish and protracted.'

FT  12 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: German investment plan may aid
coal deal
</HEADLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TWO-pronged investment programme aimed at facilitating the restructuring
of eastern Germany's brown coal fields was announced in Berlin yesterday.
The move could could also help to speed up negotiations by a consortium of
British and US companies that is aiming to buy a major share of the fields.
Mr Jurgen Stolz, chairman of Vereinigte Energiwerke, or Veag, under which
eastern Germany's energy enterprises are grouped, said that more than DM10bn
(Pounds 4.2bn) would be invested in plants, while at the same time stricter
environmental controls would be introduced in a region that was notorious
for its pollution under the former communist regime.
The announcement comes in the wake of a decision by three western German
energy suppliers to guarantee that they will continue to purchase of brown
coal from the giant lignite fields in eastern Germany. The Bavarian Baden
and EWS energy suppliers earlier this week agreed to buy up to 10m tonnes of
coal a year for the next 40 years from Mitteldeutschen Braunkohle AG,
otherwise known as Mibrag, which is the operator of eastern Germany's
troubled brown coal fields.
Mibrag, which employs more than 10,000 people, and is located in the core of
the industrial heartland between Halle and Leipzig, is held at present by
the Treuhandanstalt, Germany's agency responsible for the privatisation of
the former East German economy. Earlier this year, the Treuhand granted sole
negotiating rights to PowerGen, the UK-based utilities company, and NRG
Energy, a US energy company, which have joined forces to buy Mibrag.
A successful outcome of these negotiations would give the UK-US consortium a
good foothold in the eastern Germany energy sector, although the monopoly in
supplying energy to the five new eastern German states will be held by
western German firms under the terms of the unification treaty.
PowerGen yesterday welcomed the decision by the western German energy
companies.
'Its a very positive step for Mibrag which would help to assure its future,'
an official said.
The guaranteed market could also lessen the costs for any future buyer
towards restructuring the plant, as well as paying out large redundancy
expenses.
A spokesman for the economics ministry from the state of Saxony-Anhalt said
yesterday that 'the fields have some future and the threat of much higher
unemployment has subsided'.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brokers expect bigger coffee
export quota for Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA WILL receive a higher coffee export quota should producing and
consuming nations succeed in negotiating a new International Coffee
Agreement at the March 22-31 meeting in London, according to traders in
London.
Under the 1983 ICO agreement, which is due to expire in September but
effectively collapsed in 1989, Indonesia's quota was equivalent to 5 per
cent of world exports. Its production, however, has since risen and the
Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters estimates that exports accounted
for 8.3 per cent of the world market over the past four years.
Brokers forecast Indonesia would receive a quota of about 300,000 tonnes a
year under a new agreement, equivalent to 7.1 per cent of estimated 1992-93
world exports of 4.2m tonnes and close to Aice's demand of 7.5 per cent.
The outcome of the London meeting remains uncertain, however. While the
European Community favours a new agreement, the US and Japan are undecided.
As one London broker explains, 'US officials still at heart prefer a free
market. On the other hand, they are annoyed at being put in limelight as
holding up an agreement. Japan will follow the herd'.
An increase in Indonesia's quota to 300,000 tonnes would assume a recovery
in its exports, which totalled just 264,172 tonnes in the 1991-92 crop year,
ending last September 30, a 30 per cent drop on the previous year.
Indonesia's 1992-93 crop is forecast at 511,920 tonnes by Aice, which
estimates last year's crop at 476,280 tonnes, figures trader say are too
high. 'If you believe in those figures you would see a lot of stock in
Indonesia at present and there isn't,' notes one London trader. More
conservative estimates put 1991-92 output at 400,000 tonnes and forecast the
1992-93 crop at 420,000 tonnes.
Aice officials say Indonesian exporters continue to be squeezed by low
prices and high interest rates. Fierce competition between traders has
resulted in a minimal margin between the farm gate price of Rp1,400-Rp1,500
(68-73 US cents) a kilogram for robusta beans, which account for 93 per cent
of Indonesia's production, and the world price of 74-80 cents a kilogram.
The situation may be eased if, as London traders believe, the world price
begins an upward trend as international demand exceeds supply. 'There is
much healthier outlook for coffee. Prices will go up even without an ICO
agreement,' maintains one trader.
Aice officials say Indonesian exports between last October and the end of
January totalled 57,577 tonnes. Exports will rise when the harvest begins in
April and farmers are expected to sell stocks to finance celebrations for
the on-going Moslem month of Ramadan.

EUROPEAN government bond prices slid sharply yesterday, as markets suffered
from a bout of profit-taking, following strong gains posted by most markets
earlier this week.
Worries about the political situation in Russia, as President Boris
Yeltsin's leadership came under further pressure yesterday, fed through into
Europe's bond markets.
'The gut reaction of traders to political instability in Russia is to buy
the dollar. A strong dollar is seen as capping the potential of the bund
market,' said one trader.
Bund prices slid about  3/8 point yesterday, following recent gains, but
dealers said underlying confidence in the market remained strong, with
expectations of further easing of rates still intact.
The bund future on Liffe ended at 96.61, down from a closing price of 96.85
on Wednesday.
French bond prices also lost ground, in line with the German market,
reversing most of Wednesday's gains.
THE UK gilts market performed particularly poorly yesterday, as nervousness
ahead of next Tuesday's budget compounded broader worries.
Dealers reported switching out of long-dated gilts in favour of the short
end of the market, resulting in a steepening of the yield curve.
Dealers said investors were also taking profits, following the market's
strong run. 'Investors are still reasonably bullish on the market, but they
want to take a more defensive position ahead of the budget,' according to
one analyst.
The latest CBI survey, seen by some analysts as showing that cost increases
are starting to filter through into prices, helped depress the market.
The long gilt future on Liffe ended at 105 21/32 , down from Wednesday's
close of 106 7/32 .
SCANDINAVIAN markets were helped by some positive news yesterday. Sweden was
cheered by news that the chances of an early election had lessened when the
minority government won backing for its economic policy.
In Norway, the central bank cut its key overnight lending rate by  1/4 point
to 8 3/4 per cent, after a  1/4 point cut last week. The overnight rate had
reached 25 per cent in November.
US TREASURY prices remained trapped in a narrow trading range yesterday in
the wake of a mixed set of fresh economic data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 104
25/32 , yielding 6.748 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 25/32 , to yield 3.979 per cent.
The day's main economic news concerned the labour market and retail sales.
The latest measure of weekly jobless claims showed that the number of people
claiming state unemployment insurance jumped 25,000 in the final week of
February, a much larger increase than expect-ed.
The implication of the claims figures (which immediately cast doubt on the
recent strong February employment report) was that the jobs market remains
depressed in spite of a growing economy. Yet any boost to Treasury prices
from the data was offset by the news that retail sales last month rose a
stronger-than-forecast 0.3 per cent.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Stream of new issues slows as investors
take a cautious view
</HEADLINE>

THE STREAM of new international bond issues slowed markedly yesterday after
a hectic start to the week. The mood among investors was said to be turning
cautious in view of the latest developments in Russia and ahead of the UK
budget.
News in the afternoon that Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency,
had cut its rating of Finland's senior long-term foreign currency debt by
two notches added to the uncertainty, even though the downgrading had been
widely expected by the market. S&amp;P's move quashed market talk that Finland
was thinking of tapping the Eurosterling sector.
S&amp;P said its decision to cut Finland's rating from AA plus to AA minus
reflected the ongoing restructuring of Finnish trade and industry, which it
said had contributed to a sharp drop in economic activity and a steep rise
in government and external indebtedness.
The downgrading also incorporated the prospect of a slow and uncertain
recovery which could halt efforts to cut the government's large budget
deficits, S&amp;P said.
The Eurofranc sector came into focus yesterday, as KfW International
Finance, the financing arm of the German government agency for
re-development, raised FFr1bn through a 10-year zero-coupon Eurobond issue.
This was the fourth such offering in the French market since the start of
March, and was mainly bought by continental investors outside France.
The yield spread on KfW's bonds was set at 10 basis points above the French
government's 8 1/2 per cent OATs due 2003, and tightened to eight basis
points later in the day.
The spread was well below that on the Kingdom of Sweden's bonds, which was
now at 20 basis points over comparable OATs compared with 24 basis points at
the launch on March 8.
Syndicate managers said the tighter spread on KfW's bonds reflected the
smaller amount on offer, as well as the borrower's triple A credit rating
and its rarity value among investors.
Lafarge Coppee, the French building materials giant which announced its 1992
results on Wednesday, also raised FFr1bn through an issue of seven-year
Eurobonds. An official at the lead manager, CCF, said that the unrated
borrower was taking advantage of the lowest interest rates in France since
1957.
He said that the all-in cost to the borrower was 8.175 per cent. However, he
did not expect many more domestic corporate borrowers to tap the market
ahead of the forthcoming French elections.
Lafarge's bonds were priced to yield 8.10 per cent or 85 basis points over
the 8 1/2 per cent OATs. They were not freed to trade by the close of
business.
Elsewhere, the Bank of Tokyo's Y50bn convertible bond issue, the
largest-ever launched in yen, was well received by investors. The price of
the bonds rose to 102 bid by yesterday afternoon, up from an issue price of
par.
An official at Morgan Stanley, the lead manager, said the healthy appetite
for the bonds reflected the recent strength of the yen and the lack of
supply by Japanese companies.
The issue marked the first capital-raising programme by a Japanese bank to
be placed solely with European investors. The bonds will count as upper tier
two capital until they are converted, at which point they will count as tier
one capital.
The proceeds from the issue will raise the bank's capital-to-asset ratio,
under rules set by the Bank for International Settlements, by 0.23 per cent
to 9 per cent.
Japanese banks have been criticised in the past for placing subordinated and
perpetual debt with their own affiliates and companies with strong business
ties. The ministry of finance has recently advised Japanese securities
houses to cultivate investors outside Japan.
The Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society returned to the international bond
market after an absence of two years with a a Pounds 75m, 15-year Eurobond
issue.
The bonds were priced to yield 155 basis points over comparable UK
government bonds and the spread was unchanged after the bonds were freed to
trade.
Meanwhile, the newly-rated Czech National Bank increased its Dollars 300m
three-year issue, launched last week, by a further Dollars 75m. On
Wednesday, Moody's, the US credit rating agency, assigned an investment
grade rating of Baa3 to the borrower.
The new tranche was priced at 99.65 to yield 260 basis points above
comparable US Treasuries, in line with the yield on the outstanding bonds.
The original issue had been priced at 99.83 to yield 272 basis points over
US Treasuries on Monday.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: First Matif contracts to be

<DATELINE>
   THE FIRST Matif contracts
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
its three-month Pibor and Ecu bond futures and options - are to be listed on
Globex, the electronic futures trading system, from today. Backers of Globex
are hoping that the addition of products listed on the Matif, the French
futures exchange, and the link-up of 80 terminals in Paris, will help boost
trading volume on the system.
Trading on Globex of the more active French government bond futures will
start in two weeks, and the CAC-40 index future will be listed in a month.
Globex, the after-hours system developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
the Chicago Board of Trade and Reuters, currently trades just under 3,500
contracts per day, with 300 screens worldwide.
Initially, Matif products cannot be traded on Globex screens in the UK as
the Department of Trade and Industry has not yet accepted the Matif as a
recognised investment exchange. Further, the necessary bilateral agreements
on cross-exchange access for trading in the US have not yet been completed.
An official at the Matif said CME and CBOT members should have access to
Matif products in the next few days.
The Matif is abolishing its current after-hours telephone trading system,
known as THS (Transactions Hors Sceance), which currently accounts for about
12 per cent of volume. An official at Globex said he hoped as much as half
this volume would shift to Globex.
Globex received formal approval to trade in Japan last month, but, according
to a Reuters official, only a couple of terminals have been installed so
far, with 28 more on order. The first screens in Hong Kong are being linked
up this month, while screens in Geneva will be added in April.
Since the launch of the system last June, volume in the CME's Eurodollar
contract has accounted for 37 per cent of trading while the CBOT's T-bond
contract had made up 27 per cent of volume.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cathay ahead 1.9% in slow market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RISING costs and a sluggish world civil aviation market held Cathay Pacific,
the Hong Kong airline controlled by Swire Pacific, to 1.9 per cent growth in
1992 profits to HKDollars 3bn (USDollars 389m) from HKDollars 2.95bn the
year before.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, warned that he did not expect to see much, if any,
growth in 1993.
Cathay reinforced this view by maintaining its dividend at the 1991 level
with a final payout of 31.5 cents, making 42 cents for the year.
The profits were struck on an 11.5 per cent increase in turnover to
HKDollars 23.3bn from HKDollars 20.9bn. The higher sales were, however,
absorbed by inflation and lower yields on passenger and cargo traffic.
Mr Sutch said: 'Just because we are in Asia does not mean that we are
insulated from what is happening in the industry worldwide.'
He noted that from the fourth quarter of last year and into the first
quarter of this year demand for aviation services in Japan and continental
Europe, especially Germany, was soft. This was a more important factor than
the revenues lost as a result of a strike late in January this year.
However, Mr Sutch said that in 1991 the airline had embarked on a programme
to reduce costs. Unit costs in 1992 were held at 1991 levels, 'which shows
we have made some progress given the 10 per cent inflation we have in Hong
Kong.'
The airline sought a 15 per cent reduction in costs over the three years
1992-1994, he said. It had transferred its accounts division to neighbouring
Guangzhou in China, established a computer site in Sydney, and, on a
voluntary basis, was stationing flight crews in other parts of the region.
He expected to be able to cut aircraft maintenance costs when the airline's
subsidiary, Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company, had relocated some
facilities to southern China.
During 1992 Cathay's passenger load factor remained at 73.5 per cent, but
its yield per passenger kilometre fell by 1.6 per cent. Its yield on cargo
fell by 5.5 per cent. Capacity, however, rose by 15 per cent.
Yields are expected to remain under pressure this year, with the volume of
passenger traffic not expected to grow appreciably and the pressure on fares
likely to be downward.
Operating margins fell 1 percentage point to 13 per cent, well below the
18.5 per cent recorded in 1988. Mr Sutch said the efforts to reduce costs
were designed to reverse this trend.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Azabu dismisses 'over-zealous'
bank advisers
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AZABU Building, a leading Japanese developer which has Y700bn (Dollars
5.95bn) in outstanding debts, has dismissed the bankers transferred to
restructure the company, apparently because they were over-zealous in
selling-off properties.
Azabu's unusual move is particularly embarrassing for its main bank, Mitsui
Trust and Banking, which had provided the developer with a new president and
senior management staff, all of whom were told that they were no longer
wanted.
The dismissal of the staff was organised by Mr Kitaro Watanabe, one of the
country's best-known developers and stock speculators, who was supposed to
have resigned from active management and taken the ceremonial position of
chairman early last year.
But Mr Watanabe, who still controls a majority of Azabu shares, decided the
Mitsui Trust staff were taking the restructuring far too seriously in that
they were actually selling buildings.
Many Japanese 'restructurings' merely involve the shuffling of buildings
around affiliates in the hope that the property market will quickly improve,
and Mr Watanabe was angry that Mitsui was trying too hard to recover its
money.
'We agreed that Mitsui should sell some of our assets, but if they sell all
of our assets, we would have no business left. Mr Watanabe has a special
feeling for his hotel in Hawaii (the Hyatt Regency Waikiki) and the bankers
even wanted to strip that off,' Azabu said.
Meanwhile, Mitsui Trust claims to be mystified by the ailing company's
sudden belligerence: 'We don't know what they really want to do. We had
agreed on a restructuring and they have suddenly ended the agreement and now
we have no communications with them.'

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: BTR Nylex surprises with strong
advance to ADollars 365m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR Nylex, the Australian manufacturing arm of BTR of the UK, has exceeded
most analysts' forecasts with a big rise in profits, sales and dividend for
1992.
Net profits advanced 33.6 per cent to ADollars 365.4m (USDollars 261m) from
ADollars 273.6m on a 15.9 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 5.73bn from
ADollars 4.95bn. The annual dividend is being raised to 10 cents a share
from 9.5 cents.
Directors said the results, which included first-time contributions from
recent acquisitions Westinghouse Brake and Signal and Hawker de Havilland,
was achieved despite difficult trading conditions. 'Significant benefits
came from the restructuring carried out over the last two years and the
continuing attention to increased productivity,' they said.
'Whilst economic activity appears patchy, there are encouraging signs of
modest economic improvement in Australasia and North America.' Directors
said benefits from the capital expenditure, which rose to ADollars 541.5m
from ADollars 447.8m, would be felt in the current year. The packaging
division was the main source of the rise in earnings, lifting its pre-tax
contribution to ADollars 323.0m from ADollars 252.7m.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Compass Airlines to be wound up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPASS Airlines, the independent Australian domestic air service, has
failed to secure emergency funding and will be wound up. The company
yesterday applied to the Queensland Supreme Court for appointment of a
provisional liquidator.
This followed the failure of Mr Richard Barber, the receiver/manager
appointed last week, to pull together a funding package to allow the company
to continue trading.
Compass' demise means the Australian domestic airline industry will revert
to a duo-poly, split between Australian Airlines, a Qantas subsidiary, and
Ansett, which is jointly controlled by the News group and Thomas Nationwide
Transport (TNT).
Problems at Compass emerged publicly earlier this month when directors asked
for the appointment of a receiver/manager because of delays in securing a
ADollars 9.2m (USDollars 6.5m) funding package.
The funding package had been promised by Mr Doug Reid, deputy chairman of
Compass, who appeared yesterday in a Melbourne court on two charges of
making false statements to other board members.
It is the second time in as many years that attempts to operate a third
domestic airline service in Australia have foundered.
The earlier attempt, also called Compass and using much of the same staff,
collapsed in 1991.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Founder of Posco expected to
resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PARK Tae-joon is expected to resign today as the honorary chairman of
Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco) in a move that could lead to a management
shake-up at the world's third-largest steel company.
Meanwhile, Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of the Hyundai conglomerate,
yesterday resumed his position as honorary chairman of South Korea's biggest
group after suggesting that he may dismantle it within a year.
The actions of the two prominent industrialists are related to their
opposition to the election of Mr Kim Young-sam as South Korea's new
president.
Mr Park, who founded the state-run steel company 25 years ago, resigned from
a senior position in the ruling Democratic Liberal party and as Posco
chairman last year after he tried unsuccessfully to block Mr Kim's
nomination as a presidential candidate.
The government recently launched a tax investigation of Posco in what was
regarded as an attempt to force Mr Park to also resign as honorary chairman
and completely sever his ties with the company.
The departure of Mr Park, which is expected to be announced today at Posco's
annual meeting, is likely to cause an exodus of Mr Park's senior aides who
now manage the company.
They include Mr Hwang Kyung-ro, chairman, and Mr Park Tuk-pyo. Likely
successors being mentioned to head Posco include Mr Chung Myung-sik, the
vice-chairman, and the presidents of two other state companies, Mr Ahn
Byung-hwa of Korea Electric Power (Kepco) and Mr Ahn Chon-hak of Korea Heavy
Industries and Construction.
The return of Mr Chung Ju-yung to Hyundai as honorary chairman follows his
failed presidential bid last year and his recent resignation as an
opposition MP.
Mr Chung told the Korean press this week that he planned to break up Hyundai
into smaller independent companies within a year, although he gave no
details. His comments took Hyundai officials by surprise.
Mr Chung may have made the offer to try to persuade the government to drop
an indictment against him and other Hyundai executives for illegal election
practices during the presidential campaign.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COLES MYER, Australia's biggest retailer, has posted a modest increase in
first-half earnings despite depressed consumer spending and intense price
competition.
The directors yesterday announced a 4 per cent rise in net profits to
ADollars 236.6m (USDollars 167m) in the 26 weeks to January 24 from ADollars
227.4m a year earlier, despite a 1 per cent slide in sales to ADollars 7.9bn
from ADollars 8.0bn.
The company is raising its interim dividend by 17.9 per cent with 11 cents a
share on capital increased by a bonus issue in 1992. The previous interim
dividend was 21 cents a share on lower capital.
Mr Solomon Lew, chairman, said the result showed that the company continued
to weather the recession better than most retailers.
He pointed out that, adjusting for the sale of the company's interests in
Sandhurst Farms and Progressive Enterprises in New Zealand, pre-tax profits
rose 9.5 per cent and sales were 4.2 per cent ahead.
He said the company had reduced net debt in the period by 87.5 per cent to
ADollars 116m. This helped to reduce the company's net interest bill by more
than half from ADollars 51.4m to ADollars 24.8m. Cash flow rose 16 per cent
to ADollars 593.2m.
'We are positioned to take immediate advantage of economic improvement and
we have the financial strength to continue to invest in our own business and
in new development opportunities,' Mr Lew said.
Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive officer, said the highlight of the result
was a rise in pre-tax profits of the K mart division to ADollars 78.8m from
ADollars 43.2m. However, strong competition had hit food sales despite a
solid sales rise, he said.

TATA Iron and Steel (Tisco), India's largest company, yesterday elected a
new chairman at a dramatic boardroom meeting at which the departing
chairman, Mr Russi Mody, walked out.
The new chairman is Mr Ratan Tata, the 53-year-old head of the Tata group,
India's top industrial house, which includes Tisco. The board agreed Mr Tata
should take over when 75-year-old Mr Mody retires later this year on a date
yet to be decided.
Mr Mody, who has served Tata for 54 years, has been fighting against his
compulsory retirement in a bitter battle which has shaken Tisco and
disrupted the Tata group.
The struggle began when Tata Sons, the group's main holding company, passed
resolutions last year requiring managing directors of Tata companies to
retire at 65 and chairmen at 75. Mr Ratan Tata advanced the measure in order
to relieve Tata companies of ageing directors. They had been allowed to stay
primarily because Mr JRD Tata, the group's patriarch and Mr Ratan Tata's
predecessor, had himself stayed on the Tata Sons board despite being 88.
Mr Mody took the retirement rules as a personal attack and struggled to
prevent them being applied to Tata Steel. However, last summer he was forced
to stand down as managing director and move to non-executive chairman.
While other Tata companies fell in with Tata Sons in passing retirement
resolutions, Mr Mody's presence on the board prevented Tata Steel from
following suit. However, after Mr Mody's 75th birthday in January, Mr Ratan
Tata, Tisco's deputy chairman, decided to wait no longer and presented the
retirement resolution at yesterday's meeting. As he spoke, Mr Mody walked
out and the resolution was passed unanimously. Tisco said last night that
the date for Mr Mody's retirement would be fixed by agreement with him.

TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and industrial group, yesterday blamed the
recession, falling metal prices and foreign exchange losses for a SKr1.6bn
(Dollars 210m) loss after financial items in 1992.
The result represents a sharp turnaround from the SKr475m profit which the
group reported in 1991. The group has scrapped its dividend for 1992. In
1991 the group paid a dividend of SKr6.50 per share.
Foreign currency losses totalling SKr765m following the devaluation of the
Swedish krona played a large part in the deterioration of the group's
performance, and restructuring costs amounted to a further SKr210m.
But business conditions in core areas were difficult, and it suffered
additional costs because of inventory write-downs and production stoppages
over holiday periods.
Operating income rose to SKr23.5bn from SKr21.9bn, reflecting the
consolidation of Munskjo from the start of 1992, while the operating result
before depreciation amounted to SKr1.10bn, compared with SKr1.12bn. The loss
per share amounted to SKr21.80, after income of SKr5.10 in 1991.
Trelleborg's industry operations recorded an operating profit of SKr287m,
against SKr290m, as turnover climbed to SKr10.5bn from SKr7.7bn.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NATIONAL Semiconductor's share price rose strongly yesterday when the US
chip manufacturer reported improved third quarter earnings.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 26.9m, or 19 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 14.5m, or 11 cents, in the corresponding period last year. Net
sales rose 22 per cent to Dollars 491.5m from Dollars 401.8m.
The third-quarter results included a net contribution to income of Dollars
400,000 from exceptional items. These items included a Dollars 8.3m gain
from patent licence fees, partially offset by Dollars 3.2m in legal expenses
for a tax case and a Dollars 4.7m write-down of a minority investment.
Mr Gilbert Amelio, president and chief executive, said: 'I am pleased with
our third-quarter results, which demonstrate that we are continuing our
profitability for the sixth consecutive quarter, with substantial
improvement in income from operations.'
He added: 'Semiconductor industry business conditions continued to improve
in the third quarter.' Gross margins improved as a result of restructuring
of manufacturing operations, he said.
For the nine-month period, National Semiconductor reported net income of
Dollars 84.1m, or 63 cents per share, on sales of Dollars 1.4bn.
This compared with a net loss of Dollars 147.6m, or Dollars 1.49 per share,
on sales of Dollars 1.2bn last time.
The 1992 results included a restructuring charge of Dollars 149.3m in the
first quarter. National Semiconductor's share price closed up Dollars 1 3/8
at Dollars 12 7/8 .

VARITY, the automotive parts, farm equipment and diesel engine maker,
yesterday reported a sharp improvement in financial performance over the
past year, including a two-thirds jump in operating income and a similar
drop in long-term debt.
Net earnings of the Buffalo-based company were USDollars 27m, or 32 cents a
share, in the year to January 31, compared with a Dollars 178m loss, or
Dollars 7.87 a share, in the previous 12 months.
Before extraordinary items, income in the latest period was Dollars 39.7m.
These items include a Dollars 23.6m loss from the sale of Massey Ferguson's
distribution and finance business.
The bulk of the previous year's loss consisted of a Dollars 108.3m
restructuring charge. Sales for the year rose to Dollars 3.37bn from Dollars
3.17bn.
Operating income, excluding restructuring losses, jumped to Dollars 218m
from Dollars 131m. Long-term debt stood at Dollars 305.2m on January 31,
down from Dollars 864.2m a year earlier.
Varity's improved fortunes have been reflected in a sharp rise in its share
price on the New York stock exchange. The shares closed yesterday at Dollars
31.50, up from Dollars 25.25 at the beginning of the year.

<TEXT>
TWO executives widely seen as potential candidates for the post of chief
executive of International Business Machines have issued statements saying
they are not interested in taking the job.
Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive of Apple Computer, and Mr
Larry Bossidy, chairman and chief executive of Allied Signal, the US
industrial group, both said they intended to stay in their current posts.
There have been persistent rumours within the computer industry that IBM was
viewing both Mr Sculley and Mr Bossidy as possible successors to Mr John
Akers, who announced in late January he intended to resign once a
replacement was found.
Mr Sculley said: 'I have told Apple's board of directors and our executive
management team that I am not available or interested in being chief
executive of IBM.'
He added: 'Ten years ago this April I signed up to do a job, and there is
still a lot that I would like to accomplish with all of us (at Apple).'
Similarly, Mr Larry Bossidy, chairman and chief executive, said he intended
to remain at Allied Signal 'to complete the job I came here to do'.
But Mr Edward Lucente, a former senior IBM executive, yesterday announced
his resignation from Northern Telecom, where he has been executive
vice-president for the past two years since leaving IBM.
During his 30-year career at IBM, Mr Lucente was occasionally mentioned as a
potential successor to Mr Akers. He headed IBM's extensive Asian operations.
Mr Lucente's departure from Northern Telecom follows that of Mr Paul Stern,
former chairman and chief executive, who resigned in January. Mr Stern is
also a former IBM executive mentioned as a potential candidate for the post
of IBM chief executive.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Swedbank pushed further in the
red by credit loss surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDBANK, the Swedish savings bank, underlined the extent of the crisis in
the Swedish banking sector when it announced a sharp increase in operating
losses to SKr11.8bn (Dollars 1.5bn) in 1992 from the SKr4.4bn it suffered a
year earlier.
The bank blamed its performance on a surge in credit losses, which amounted
to SKr18.5bn, or 4.5 per cent of total lending, compared with SKr10.2bn in
1991.
It expects loan losses to continue at a high level in the next two years
because of the continuing crisis in the Swedish economy.
The bank has applied to the government for support to ensure that its
capital adequacy ratio stays above 8 per cent.
Swedbank was only formally established at the end of 1992, following the
merger of 11 different savings banks, although the merger is retroactive to
January 1 1992.
The 1991 figures are pro-forma.
The operating result before loan losses climbed 17 per cent to SKr6.8bn from
SKr5.8bn.
Two-thirds of loan losses stemmed from the real estate sector, with private
individuals accounting for just 10 per cent of the total.
The bank said its 20 largest losses accounted for SKr6.4bn, or 35 per cent
of the total.
Total problem exposures after provisions amounted to SKr25.7bn, or 6 per
cent of total lending, at the end of 1992 when its capital adequacy ratio
stood at 9.3 per cent.
The bank is aiming to cut expenses by SKr2bn by the end of next year from
their 1991 level of SKr9.6bn.
Last year it cut 1,280 full-time jobs.
This helped it to reduce expenses by 12 per cent.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Siemens chief repeats warning on
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HEINRICH von Pierer, chief executive of Siemens, the German electronics
and electrical group, yesterday repeated it would be difficult to match
1991-1992 profits in the current financial year.
Speaking at the company's annual meeting in Munich, he said that after five
years of profits growth, it would be a great achievement if profits held at
the same level as in the year to the end of September 1992. Profits for that
period climbed 9 per cent to DM1.96bn on sales of DM78.5bn.
The company's view of prospects has deteriorated slightly since Mr von
Pierer first gave his veiled warning on profits in mid-January. He said that
he expected group sales to rise 6 per cent to DM83bn this year - marginally
worse than January when he said sales would climb to DM84bn.
In the first five months of the year, order intake slipped by 2 per cent to
DM33bn while sales increased 3 per cent to DM29.5bn, Mr von Pierer revealed
yesterday.
He warned that it was hardly to be expected that a company such as Siemens
would be unaffected by recessionary conditions in Germany. He said that the
number of people employed by the group would be down to 400,000 by the end
of the financial year, from 407,000 now and 413,000 less than five months
before.
The job cuts will affect all business areas, but Siemens Nixdorf, the
group's computer subsidiary, will be hardest hit. He said the group was
making good progress in cutting losses in the computers and semiconductors
businesses.
Siemens was attacked yesterday over the special voting rights attached to
the company's preference shares, a class of shares owned exclusively by
descendants of Mr Werner von Siemens, the company founder.
Prof Ekkehard Wenger from the University of Wurzburg proposed the abolition
of the voting rights, which under certain circumstances give the holders of
the preference shares up to 9.5 per cent of the votes in the company
although they account for 1.65 per cent of the group's share capital. Late
yesterday, it looked likely that the motion would be defeated.

<TEXT>
LOWER operating earnings from its entertainment division and seasonal losses
in publishing caused a sharp decline in net profits at Paramount
Communications during the first quarter of fiscal 1993 ended January 31.
The company recorded first-quarter net income of less than Dollars 1m, or 1
cent per share, compared with Dollars 18.4m, or 16 cents, in the first three
months of fiscal 1992.
Revenues also declined, to Dollars 943.7m in the quarter from Dollars 1.07bn
a year earlier.
Paramount said the weak performance of film releases resulted in lower
operating income, despite higher contributions from television programming
operations.
Entertainment results in the first quarter also reflected lower operating
income from television broadcast stations and theatrical exhibition
operations.
Paramount added that its theme parks division, acquired in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1992, suffered a small loss.

VARITY, the automotive parts, farm equipment and diesel engine maker,
yesterday reported a sharp improvement in financial performance over the
past year, including a two-thirds jump in operating income and a similar
drop in long-term debt.
Net earnings of the Buffalo-based company were USDollars 27m, or 32 cents a
share, in the year to January 31, compared with a Dollars 178m loss, or
Dollars 7.87 a share, in the previous 12 months.
Before extraordinary items, income in the latest period was Dollars 39.7m.
These items include a Dollars 23.6m loss from the sale of Massey Ferguson's
distribution and finance business.
The bulk of the previous year's loss consisted of a Dollars 108.3m
restructuring charge.
Sales for 1992 rose to Dollars 3.37bn from Dollars 3.17bn, due largely to a
12 per cent improvement at Kelsey-Hayes, the automotive parts maker which
specialises in wheels and anti-lock braking systems.
Operating income, excluding restructuring losses, jumped to Dollars 218m
from Dollars 131m. Long-term debt stood at Dollars 305.2m on January 31,
down from Dollars 864.2m a year earlier.
Mr Victor Rice, chairman, yesterday forecast a further improvement in
earnings this year.
Kelsey-Hayes, which Varity acquired in 1989 and which contributes almost
half its revenues, is expected to benefit from a stronger North American
market, especially for light trucks.
Earnings at Massey Ferguson and Perkins, the diesel engine maker, will be
boosted by weak sterling. On the other hand, Mr Rice predicted a further
decline in the European farm equipment market this year.
Varity's improved fortunes have been reflected in a sharp rise in its share
price on the New York stock exchange. The shares were trading at Dollars
35.75 before the close, up from Dollars 25.25 at the beginning of the year.

prices

STORA, Europe's largest pulp and paper group, said yesterday it was halving
its dividend to SKr6.50 per share after recording a SKr1.36bn (Dollars 179m)
loss after financial items in 1992.
Sharply lower prices were responsible for the deficit, which compares with a
SKr595m profit in 1991, after sales sagged to SKr46.9bn from SKr51.9bn.
'Price levels deteriorated sharply during the year because of overcapacity,
deregulation, the general recession and a turbulent currency market,' the
group said.
However, it was more upbeat about prospects for 1993, although it expects
weaker development in Europe due to reduced growth in Germany. It cited the
depreciation of the krona and the improving US economy as positive factors.
The big 1992 loss had been expected after Stora revealed preliminary figures
in January. The loss reflected one-off costs of SKr847m to cover further
restructuring. These costs were only partly offset by SKr375m in capital
gains.
The performance in the final four months of the year was particularly weak,
when the group struck an operating loss of SKr238m and a loss after
financial items of SKr979m.
Full-year sales fell SKr3.7bn, adjusted for divestments, with lower volumes
and prices for the building materials sector accounting for SKr1bn of the
decline. A further SKr3.3bn of the decline was attributed to lower prices
for forest products, although this was partially offset by increased
volumes, which added SKr700m.
Cost reductions of SKr2bn, following the group's extensive rationalisation
programme, ensured the deficit was not greater. The company reduced its
payroll by 4,100 employees in 1992 and is promising a further 2,500 job cuts
this year as part of a new SKr1.8bn savings programme.
Stora Feldmuhle reported an operating loss of SKr258m for the year, sharply
reversing the SKr915m profit recorded a year earlier. The group blamed a 20
per cent fall in newsprint prices and a 12 per cent fall in prices for
lightweight coated paper for the decline, even though demand for both
products increased.
Stora Cell, the pulp unit, recorded a deepened loss of SKr394m, against
SKr310m, following substantial one-off costs and the write-down of a
forestry project in Portugal.
Group investments fell to SKr2.43bn during the year from SKr3.38bn. The loss
per share amounted to SKr18.70, compared with income of SKr8.60 in 1991.

VITAL Forsikring, the Norwegian insurer, yesterday reported a rise in 1992
net profit, after allocations to shareholders and policyholders, to NKr723m
(Dollars 103m) from NKr644m in 1991.
Mr Bjoern Elvestad, chief executive, said: 'We are not satisfied with the
rate of return on the company's funds in 1992, but the developments in the
financial markets since the turn of the year show how quickly the picture
can change.' Mr Elvestad said that at the end of this February the company's
securities investments, including realised and unrealised items, amounted to
NKr840m.
Allocations to shareholders fell last year to NKr126m from NKr218m in the
previous year while those to policyholders rose to NKr655m from NKr173m. The
board proposed a dividend of NKr4.75 a share, unchanged from 1991.
Group operating profit advanced to NKr824m in 1992 from NKr718m in 1991,
while premium income increased by NKr79m to NKr2.802bn.
Gross financial income rose by NKr78m, or by 3.8 per cent, to NKr2.625bn.
Vital said it wrote down the value of shareholdings by NKr186m, with
Eiendomsspar, in which it holds a 32 per cent stake, accounting for NKr133m
of the total.
Vital also wrote down the value of its real estate portfolio by NKr70m. 'In
addition, the portfolio reserve has been reduced by NKr36m,' Vital said.
Following these write-downs, the book value of the company's directly-owned
properties is NKr1.633bn, against NKr1.619bn in 1991.
The insurer said actual and estimated losses on residential and commercial
property were NKr34m, NKr12m more than in 1991, representing 0.24 per cent
of total loans. Vital said it wrote down by NKr40m a NKr50m short-term loan
to Investa, the collapsed Norwegian investment company.
Group assets rose last year to NKr35.136bn from NKr33.722bn a year earlier.

BANCA Nazionale del Lavoro, the Italian Treasury-owned bank, reported net
profits at parent company level of L78bn (Dollars 49m) in 1992. The figure,
covering BNL's first year as a joint stock company marked a 5.1 per cent
increase over 1991.
The results reflected the effects of Italy's recession and the need for
substantial write-downs on securities following last year's sharp fall in
government bond prices.
BNL made L356bn in write-downs on equity holdings and bonds. In all, L985bn
was set aside in depreciation and provisions, of which L751bn went into the
bank's risk reserves.
Mr Giampiero Cantoni, chairman, said the results were 'positive' in a
difficult economic environment and worrying operating conditions.
In particular, the bank had built up its sovereign risk provisions to over
65 per cent of its exposure, in spite of the sharp fall in the value of the
lira against the dollar.
Total deposits in lira and other currencies rose by 8 per cent to L50,290bn,
while total loans increased by 7.8 per cent to L46,175bn on a similar basis.

ROYAL Caribbean Cruises, one of the largest cruise ship operators in the US,
is coming to the stock market.
The Miami-based company has made its 'initial public offering' filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It did not detail the precise timing for the flotation, nor the number of
shares to be offered. However, it did register 9.08m shares at a proposed
maximum offering price of Dollars 19 a share. It said the proceeds would be
used to repay secured debt facilities. Anything remaining would go for
'general purposes'.
Royal Caribbean was formed in the 1960s by three Norwegian companies - I. M.
Skaugen, Gotaas Larsen and Anders Wilhelmsen - and merged with Admiral
Cruises in 1988. In that year, Anders Wilhelmsen bought out the other
partners and set up a joint ownership arrangement with interests related to
Chicago's Pritzker family. The company operates nine ships.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Marriott pacifies some
disgruntled bondholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
MARRIOTT Corporation yesterday announced it had reached agreement in
principle with a group of disgruntled bondholders who have been opposing the
company's plans to 'demerge' its financially-healthy hotel management
operations from its property-related assets.
No sooner was the pact announced than a second grouping of unhappy
bondholders, led by PPM America - the US fund management arm of Britain's
Prudential insurance group - pledged to continue litigation against Marriott
over the scheme.
'This is totally inadequate,' said one lawyer, acting for the PPM group,
'and doesn't begin to redress the losses and damages sustained by our
clients.'
The pact would revise the capital structures of the two quoted companies
created by the demerger and offer bondholders a chance to swap into more
attractive debt securities.
Under the deal, the demerger plan would still go ahead, with the hotel and
food services operations being spun off into a new quoted company, called
Marriott International, and the property assets and airport-tollroad
concessions remaining as a separate entity, to be renamed Host Marriott.
But about Dollars 450m of additional debt and assets would be shifted into
Marriott International and Dollars 70m of Marriott Corporation shares would
be issued to retire public bonds.
In addition, Marriott International would provide up to Dollars 125m of
mortgage financing for Host Marriott's new Philadelphia Marriott Hotel;
Dollars 200m of a Dollars 630m credit line, to be provided by Marriott
International to Host Marriott, would be funded at the close of the
bondholders' exchange offer; and the availability of the credit line would
be extended until 2007.
Under the exchange offer, bondholders could swap into new Host Marriott
bonds, providing interest rates which would be 100 basis points higher and
maturities extended about four years later than the present Marriott bonds.
Marriott said the revisions would mean Host Marriott's total debt would be
reduced by around Dollars 500m. This entity had been due to retain virtually
all of Marriott Corporation's Dollars 3bn long-term debt burden.
Mr Stephen Bollenbach, Marriott's finance director, said Marriott
International's projected pro forma earnings would be reduced only modestly
by the revisions - by around 7 cents a share in 1993, and less than 5 cents
in 1994. On a pro forma basis, using early-1993 figures, Marriott
International would have long-term debt of about Dollars 900m.
Bondholders who have reached the agreement in principle have been
represented by Goldman Sachs. They include big US institutions, among them
the California Public Employees Retirement System, IDS Financial Services
and Allstate insurance.
The PPM grouping - whose lawsuit centres on Dollars 400m of bonds issued by
Marriott last year - has demanded full restoration of the bonds trading
value and credit quality.
Yesterday, analysts at Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, said although
details of the revisions could lead to a 'modest upgrade' in credit quality,
the rating was still likely to remain in a low to mid-speculative grade.

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ Corporation, the world's largest mining company, yesterday ruled out a
rights issue to finance its move into the US coal industry. Sir Derek
Birkin, chairman, reporting results for 1992 which showed a flat
performance, said 'there is no question of us looking for a rights issue'.
RTZ is paying Dollars 1.3bn for two companies, Nerco and Cordero Mining,
which will take gearing to about 63 per cent. Sir Derek said the group was
comfortable with this gearing, which RTZ aimed to cut by selling Nerco's oil
and gas and minerals assets.
He said the underlying result in 1992 was 'resilient in a very difficult
year'. However, he warned RTZ was not 'sanguine about an early or pronounced
upturn in metal prices'. RTZ's shares fell 13p to 675p.
Mr Robert Wilson, chief executive, said there had been some further
weakening of prices so far this year. That prompted an unchanged 13.5p final
dividend, to give a same-again total of 19.5p.
The group has adopted FRS 3. Although pre-tax profits rose 23.4 per cent
from Pounds 435m to Pounds 537m, Mr Wilson said a 1 per cent increase in
adjusted earnings - excluding exceptional items and discontinued activities
 -from Pounds 344m to Pounds 348m, was 'the most meaningful reflection of
the performance of the business'. He said that on average metal prices fell
2 per cent in the year and demand was 'a bit' lower.
Turnover fell 5.6 per cent to Pounds 4.6bn, and operating profits declined
14.7 per cent to Pounds 370m, before associate profits rose 11.8 per cent to
Pounds 274m. Exceptional charges totalled Pounds 93m, down from Pounds 201m.
After a higher tax rate, earnings were Pounds 249m, up 21.5 per cent. On the
old accounting rules, earnings were 2.6 per cent higher at Pounds 316m.
Reported earnings per share were 24.8p compared with 20.7p last year.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: ABB plans Asia move as profits
dip
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ASEA BROWN BOVERI, Europe's biggest electrical engineering company, plans to
spend Dollars 1bn over the next five years to expand its presence in the
rapidly-rowing markets of Asia.
The Swiss-Swedish engineering group yesterday announced a 4 per cent decline
in 1992 pre-tax profits after financial items to Dollars 1.11bn from Dollars
1.15bn. The result was in line with expectations, and reflects two years of
recession in western Europe.
The group had 213,400 employees at the end of last year, and has shed 35,000
jobs since the spring of 1990. Net of acquisitions, jobs are still being
shed at a rate of 1,000 a month, said Mr Percy Barnevik, ABB's president and
chief executive.
He stressed that the job cuts were one of a number of factors that had
strengthened ABB through the past two years of recession.
The group had reduced its net debt by Dollars 2bn to zero over 1991 and
1992, and had increased research and development spending by Dollars 450m.
Last year's R&amp;D spend was Dollars 2.4bn, 8 per cent of its Dollars 29.6bn
revenues.
Yesterday's figures underlined the large differences in financial
performance of ABB's business segments. The best performer was power plants,
which lifted profits to Dollars 444m last year from Dollars 366m in 1991.
In contrast, the struggling transportation business, which includes the
former Brel railway rolling stock builder in the UK, plunged to a Dollars
40m loss from a Dollars 21m profit.
Mr Barnevik said it would take a couple of years for ABB's restructuring
efforts to bring earnings in transportation up to average levels for the
group.
In regional terms, Asia was the star performer for ABB last year, with
orders up 34 per cent to Dollars 6.6bn. Mr Goran Lindahl, executive
vice-president with responsibility for Asia, said the goal was to double the
order intake over the next five years.
ABB has 21,000 employees in Asia, and Mr Lindahl said ABB was involved in
joint venture talks with about 50 companies in the region.
Mr Barnevik said the group could finance its Asian and eastern European
expansion internally by reducing working capital.
He said he did not see the need to raise any new equity, and would not
comment on long-rumoured plans for an ABB share issue - the two parent
companies Asea and BBC Brown Boveri each own half of ABB and are
publicly-quoted, but ABB is not.
Overall, ABB's orders rose 7 per cent last year to Dollars 31.6bn. Increased
non-recurring items left net income down 17 per cent at Dollars 505m
compared with Dollars 609m for the same period in the previous year.
On the outlook, Mr Barnevik said he expected profits after financial items
to be about the same this year as the Dollars 1.11bn achieved in 1992.
The US market for consumable items would pick up slowly, he said, spilling
over into Europe by the end of the year. But domestic conditions would
remain tough in Scandinavia, and there would be a further decline in demand
in Germany.
The latest figures from ABB round off the first five years of trading for
one of Europe's most important manufacturing companies.
Since ABB was formed in 1988, it has undergone both heavy restructuring in
Europe and North America and significant expansion elsewhere - especially in
eastern Europe and Asia.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Marc Rich hopes for resolution
of tax case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZUG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MARC RICH, the leading international commodity trader, still hopes for a
settlement of the tax evasion case that has left him a fugitive from the US
for a decade.
'I am convinced that at some time in the future US attornies will recognise
that the transactions were guided by expert tax counsel and were proper,' Mr
Rich said in an interview at his Zug headquarters. 'When that recognition
occurs, a resolution of this matter will be possible.'
The 58-year-old Mr Rich, who this week announced his resignation as chief
executive of the Marc Rich &amp; Co international commodity trading group, said
he would continue to direct the business as chairman.
'I am not retiring,' he said. His new role would be mostly an advisory one,
and he would work a normal eight-hour day instead of 12 hours in the office
plus taking work home.
Mr Willy Strothotte, a former Rich executive who quit last year because of a
difference over management philosophy, has returned as chief executive with
responsibility for day-to-day management.
Mr Rich shed little light on Mr Strothotte's surprising return, saying: 'We
see eye to eye'.
He foresaw no large changes in the way the group was run. 'Mr Strothotte has
been with the company 15 years. He grew up in it and is fully familiar with
its spirit. The things which are good he will continue. I am sure he will
find new and different ways of doing things which obviously will be better.'
Mr Rich is reducing his share stake in Marc Rich &amp; Co from slightly over 50
per cent to 40 per cent.
'What is happening is in line with a policy that my partners and I
established many years ago. We have been making shares available to younger
executives, and the aim was always that they should obtain a majority.'
He denied rumours that he needed the substantial sum he would get from
reducing his stake in the group which has a net worth of over Dollars 1bn.
He dismissed frequent charges that his group breaks international embargoes
in its trading practices.
'Our policy is that we obey laws, and we comply with embargoes wherever they
are. At the same time, I am a believer in free trade, and I believe that
people who are affected by embargoes always find ways around them.'
He said the group was wrongly accused of doing business with Iraq about 18
months ago.
'There was correspondence, but it made clear that everything was subject to
the United Nations sanctions being lifted. And what was involved was
humanitarian aid - food and medicine - not trade.'

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bayer posts 16% drop to DM2.7bn
for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAYER, the least recession-prone of the big three German chemicals groups,
yesterday reported pre-tax profits down by 16 per cent to DM2.7bn (Dollars
1.62bn) for last year from DM3.2bn in 1991. Sales for the year dropped 2.8
per cent to DM41.2bn
The dividend for the year will be cut to DM11 per share from DM13 - the
first time the company has cut its dividend in a decade.
The figures were in line with analysts' expectations and highlight Bayer's
resilience amid the current severe downturn in the European chemicals
industry, especially when compared to fellow German chemicals companies
Hoechst and BASF.
Earlier this week, BASF cut its dividend by DM2 to DM10 per share and
reported pre-tax profits down by 41 per cent to DM1.24bn. Hoechst cut its
dividend by DM3 to DM9 per share and reported pre-tax profits down 17.7 per
cent to DM2.1bn.
A detailed breakdown of last year's figures will come at next week's press
conference, but analysts said that the Bayer's resilience last year
reflected its relatively small exposure to the badly-hit petrochemicals and
plastics areas of the chemicals industry, and the high proportion of sales
and profits coming from health care.
Pharmaceuticals contributed DM1.74bn to Bayer's DM3.2bn operating profits in
1991, more than at the other two large chemicals companies in absolute and
relative terms.
Analysts said that Bayer could have afforded not to have cut its dividend
for last year. They estimated that its dividend was twice covered by
earnings, while at BASF the dividend is likely to absorb 95 per cent of
earnings.
Last year, it held its dividend while the other two chemicals companies cut
theirs. Analysts expected this year's cut in the light of the general
economic downturn in Germany.

FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Renault improves 85% despite
loss in final term

<TEXT>
RENAULT, the French state-controlled carmaker, fell deeply into loss in the
final quarter of last year but still managed to report a nearly doubled
annual net profit of FFr5.7bn (Dollars 1.04bn).
Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman, warned this year would be 'execrable', and
that profits would fall. He forecast a 9 per cent to 10 per cent decline in
the European car market, the steepest since the 1974 oil price crisis.
Renault, 80 per cent owned by the state and 20 per cent owned by Volvo, its
Swedish partner, is a possible privatisation candidate.
Net profits at Renault rose by 84.5 per cent on turnover up by 8.1 per cent
to FFr179.4bn. Car sales, the source of the earnings increase, climbed by 12
per cent to FFr150bn. With just over 2m vehicles sold - up 6.7 per cent -
Renault managed its best unit sales performance for nine years.
Operating profits rose to FFr7.92bn from FFr4.66bn, one of the best
performances from a leading car company, in what had been an exceptional
year, said Mr Schweitzer. Within this, the car division rose to FFr8.69bn
last year from FFr4.67bn.
However, the group made a FFr961m pre-tax loss in the final quarter of 1992,
due to a FFr600m decline in franc income from the devaluation of sterling
and the lira against the French currency, FFr956m of exceptional charges and
Renault's share of Volvo's losses. Currency shifts will this year remove
another FFr3bn from taxable profits at Renault, which does not hedge against
exchange rate shifts, said Mr Schweitzer.
Volvo contributed a FFr1.37bn loss for the full year, on top of a FFr1.15bn
loss from Renault's truck division. There were signs that recovery at Volvo
and Renault's truck division would eventually become profitable, said Mr
Schweitzer.
Registrations of Renault cars in a stagnant European market rose by 5.8 per
cent last year, helped by a strong rise in French sales. This allowed the
French group to lift its European market share from 10 per cent to 10.6 per
cent. The group has a more than 5 per cent market share in every European
country except Britain, where it will pass that benchmark this year, he
said.
Finance charges fell to FFr831m from FFr1.19bn in 1991, thanks to a fall in
debt to FFr12.55bn from FFr15.53bn net over the same period. That leaves
gearing at 37 per cent of shareholders' equity of FFr33.97bn.

<TEXT>
VNU, the Dutch publishing group, yesterday identified a Dutch printing
company, De Boer Boekhoven, as a possible partner for its printing division.
The division has been a candidate for full or partial divestment since 1990.
The company was forced to concede that it was negotiating with De Boer after
a Dutch newspaper reported that VNU was poised to sell a majority stake in
the division to the printing company.
VNU declined to comment further on the press report or on the negotiations,
which it described as being in the early stages.
The choice of De Boer comes as a surprise because it is smaller in size than
VNU's printing division and because a foreign buyer had been expected to
come forward.

Ben Bailey Construction, the Yorkshire-based housebuilder, returned to
profit in the six months to December 31 with Pounds 24,000 before tax in the

Turnover was Pounds 8.26m, against Pounds 9.66m which included Pounds 1.26m
from discontinued operations. Interest payable fell to Pounds 202,000

SANDERSON Murray &amp; Elder (Holdings), the North Yorkshire-based motor dealer,
saw profits dip 8 per cent, from Pounds 1.53m to Pounds 1.41m pre-tax, over
the 1992 year.
The outcome masked a marginal improvement in operating profits - from Pounds
1.64m to Pounds 1.91m on continuing operations. Net interest charges,
however, rose to Pounds 500,000 (Pounds 133,000) reflecting cash
acquisitions.
Turnover, boosted by the acquisitions, jumped to Pounds 107m (Pounds 72.3m),
including a contribution of Pounds 5.73m (Pounds 7.57m) from discontinued
operations.
A proposed final dividend of 1.4p maintains the total for the year at 2p,
covered just over 3 times by earnings of 6.2p (8.7p).
The results were compiled under FRS 3.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Refuge dividend rise boosts share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFUGE GROUP, the life assurance company, yesterday increased its total
dividend for 1992 by 9 per cent, from 29p to 31.5p, with a recommended final
of 21.9p.
The shares rose from 994p to Pounds 10.20p.
Profits after tax rose from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 14.4m reflecting growth
in life net premium income from Pounds 205m to Pounds 229m. Earnings per
share were higher at 28.13p, compared with 25.81p.
The profit was struck after losses of Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 1.9m) relating to
discontinued activities and an exceptional provision of Pounds 3.01m (Pounds
2.7m) against RLJ Finance, a personal loans subsidiary.
The bulk of RLJ's performing loan book was sold in November and external
debt collectors were appointed in January.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 3.32m (Pounds 593,000) included the loss
of Pounds 8.24m on the sale of Douglas Allen Spiro, the estate agency
business, announced last week. Mr Tom Booth, chairman, said: 'The chances of
a return to adequate profitability over the next two or three years were
considered to be slim.'
Refuge found, in common with several other life companies, that the life
assurance sales generated by the estate agency did not justify continuing
with the business.
There was an an extraordinary profit of Pounds 4.92m on the sale of
Canterbury Life, a small life assurance company, to the ordinary life fund
of Refuge Assurance.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Yen for pound helps Foreign &amp; Colonial net
assets advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN &amp; Colonial Investment Trust celebrated its 125th anniversary by
raising its final dividend by 5.2 per cent - the 22nd consecutive annual
increase.
The trust, the UK's largest, increased net assets by 22 per cent in 1992,
compared to a 15 per cent rise in the FT-A All-Share Index.
Net assets per share were 225.5p (184.7p) at the end of the year, making the
consolidated net assets Pounds 1.18bn.
Mr Michael Hart, joint manager of the trust, said that the performance was
helped by the decision to switch yen borrowings into sterling before the
pound's departure from the exchange rate mechanism.
Stock selection was also successful, with BAT and Home Depot performing
particularly well.
However, the group's move into Japanese equities has yet to bear fruit and
it was underexposed to Hong Kong last year.
Mr Hart said he thought the FT-SE 100 Index would reach 3100 by the end of
the year, as UK corporate profits benefited from rationalisation, lower
interest rates and devaluation.
At the end of the year, the portfolio was split, in asset terms: UK (40 per
cent); Europe (15 per cent); US (30 per cent); Japan (9 per cent); Far East
(4 per cent) and Latin America (2 per cent).
The number of individual shareholders increased to 56,751 by the end of 1992
and 58,131 by the end of February 1993.
Private investors now own 39 per cent of the trust, compared with 24 per
cent at the end of 1986.
The recommended final dividend is 2.23p, making a total of 3.35p (3.19p). A
further Pounds 1m was added to revenue reserves.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Smith &amp; Nephew more than doubled to Pounds
155m - Boost from arthroscopy and wound healing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITH &amp; Nephew, the international healthcare and consumer group, reported
pre-tax profits more than doubled from Pounds 70.3m to Pounds 154.6m for
1992.
The rise reflected a strong performance from the arthroscopy and special
wound healing sectors.
The figures have been adjusted for accounting standard FRS 3.
The rise was boosted by the Pounds 40.1m profit on the sale of the Nivea
trademark.
This was partially offset by a Pounds 19m restructuring charge relating to
S&amp;N's withdrawal from UK denim cloth manufacturing.
Turnover improved some 8 per cent, from Pounds 791.7m to Pounds 857.7m,
including a contribution of Pounds 25.8m, against Pounds 42.1m, from
discontinued operations.
Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said: 'We are confident of continuing
real earnings growth through the development of our niche products.'
Wound management, casting bandaging and support, trauma and arthroscopy and
orthopaedic implants divisions generated more than 60 per cent of turnover.
The US now accounts for 42 per cent of sales; UK and continental Europe 40
per cent and 18 per cent in the rest of the world. S&amp;N is to expand its
recently-opened office in Japan, which is already profitable.
Mr Robinson said there were more opportunities to expand overseas, which
could lead to more acquisitions on the high-growth healthcare side.
While healthcare reported a big increase in operating profits, from Pounds
108.1m to Pounds 119.6m, consumer and plastics fell slightly to Pounds 26.4m
(Pounds 26.9m).
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 68m to Pounds 43m, representing gearing of
12 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 10.2p (4p), compared with an adjusted 9.3p.
A final dividend of 2.82p makes a total of 4.62p (4.44p).
COMMENT
There has always been a question mark over Smith &amp; Nephew's ability to
deliver its promise of real earnings growth. The full year results suggest
that shareholders who remained patient while the company refocused its
strategy are now being rewarded. The core businesses relating to healthcare
account for more than 60 per cent of revenue. Given the demographic trends
there is no reason why demand for the group's high technology and high
margin products, such as artificial joints and key-hole surgery, should not
continue to expand. The increase in US sales cuts both ways: the tax charge
is expected to rise from 29 per cent to 33 per cent, while the new
administration's emphasis on hospital efficiency should boost sales. With
forecast profits of Pounds 175m pre-tax, the shares, up 2 1/4 p to 155 1/2 p
yesterday, are on a prospective multiple of 13.6.  While they remain at a
discount to the market they look good value.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists surges 48% to Pounds 23m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS CHEMISTS, the acquisitive retailer and healthcare wholesaler,
increased pre-tax profits by 48 per cent, from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 22.6m,
in the six months to December 31.
Turnover jumped 81 per cent to Pounds 394.7m (Pounds 218.4m), boosted by the
Pounds 99m Macarthy acquisition, completed a year ago, and rapid growth of
the Barclay Enterprise wholesaler.
Extra shares in issue following the Macarthy deal slowed the advance in
earnings per share to 16 per cent at 12.4p (10.68p).
Mr Allen Lloyd, who recently split his chairman-chief executive role, giving
the latter to his brother Peter, said group turnover had already surpassed
the Pounds 509.4m made in 1991-92.
The chemist division, which has 869 stores, increased sales to Pounds 210.2m
(Pounds 143.1m) in the first half. Most of this came from acquisition;
like-for-like growth was 4 per cent.
Margins were eroded by the NHS-imposed cut in generic drug prices, costing
between Pounds 2m and Pounds 3m in profit.
The most rapid growth came from Barclay Enterprise, which Mr Lloyd said was
now third in the wholesale market behind AAH and UniChem. Turnover in the
wholesale and manufacturing division leapt to Pounds 110.2m (Pounds 21.8m).
Barclay was a lower margin business, with a 2-3 per cent return on sales
rather than the 7-10 per cent of retailing. It also accounted for much of
the Pounds 14.2m increase in working capital.
The Supersave drugstore division added 15 shops to make a total of 247 and
sales rose to Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 31.6m). Like-for-like growth has improved
to 8 per cent since the year-end. Holland &amp; Barrett healthfood added 26
shops to make 250. Like-for-like growth was slight. Overall sales reached
Pounds 26.8m (Pounds 21.9m).
Net debt rose from Pounds 20.9m at the year-end to Pounds 32.4m, giving
gearing of 31 per cent. Mr Lloyd said interest payments were nine times
covered by operating profits of Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 16.5m).
The interim dividend is raised to 2p (1.55p).
COMMENT
Lloyds has gone out of its way to reassure the sceptics with copious notes
on cashflow and Cadbury-style reforms of its board - not that anyone could
doubt that Allen Lloyd is still the boss. It now wants to be seen as a
wholesome healthcare distributor, like AAH and UniChem, rather than as an
acquisition-led retailer throwing its paper around. Hence the stress on the
galloping organic growth at Barclay. However, third place in the wholesale
market has proved something of a graveyard - Macarthy and Medicopharma
pulled out in recent years. Lloyds may do better through its bias towards
toiletries and OTC treatments. On the retail front, its ambition is hardly
dormant with more than 100 store openings a year. Full-year profit is
forecast to top Pounds 50m (Pounds 36.9m) giving a prospective p/e of 11.
Some discount to the market is to be expected because of its hyper-active
record, but a 30 per cent one looks too much. The price has recovered
substantially since September, but there looks to be room for a little more.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Strong showing by outplacement side behind
sharp recovery at DC Gardner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DC GARDNER Group, the outplacement, conference centre and financial training
company which has undergone a substantial restructuring in the past two
years, moved back into profit in 1992, underpinned by a strong performance
by Coutts, its outplacement and career management unit.
Having issued a profits warning and replaced its chief executive in
November, the group yesterday reported annual pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.22m, compared to a restated loss of Pounds 10.1m in the previous year.
Earnings of 1.85p compared to a loss of 49.19p; the dividend is again
omitted.
The 1991 result was originally reported as a Pounds 3.76m pre-tax loss, but
has been restated to comply with the FRS 3 reporting standard.
Sir Kit McMahon, who took over as non-executive chairman in November, said
1992 had been 'a year of recovery and continued restructuring after the
disappointing results in earlier years.'
The group posted an operating profit of Pounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.98m loss)
after exceptional costs of Pounds 349,000 (Pounds 3.15m) on turnover of
Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 18m).
Mr Stephen Johnson, chief executive, noted that all three divisions had
improved their performance. In particular operating profits in the core
outplacement division jumped to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 1.42m) on turnover of
Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 10.1m).
The division has recently won four contracts worth Pounds 5m. These include
significant IBM and Ministry of Defence outplacement contracts.
The residential conference centres improved operating profit by 22 per cent
to Pounds 1.18m in a 'tough market'.
Losses in the training division were trimmed from Pounds 410,000 to Pounds
360,000.
The division's results were depressed by the Pounds 859,000 (Pounds 760,000)
cost of its Harbour Exchange building in London's docklands.
The year ended with net borrowings at Pounds 2.96m (Pounds 3.77m),
representing gearing of 30 per cent, down from 40 per cent.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Manders expands by 50% to Pounds 9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXTRAORDINARY charges of Pounds 2.12m in Manders (Holdings) 1992 results
included Pounds 1.9m defence costs incurred in the hostile Pounds 106.1m bid
it repelled from Kalon, the paints group, in August.
By choosing not to adopt FRS 3 accounting standards in the figures for the
12 months, the paints, inks and property group's pre-tax profits emerged 50
per cent ahead at Pounds 9.04m (Pounds 6.04m).
Earnings per share rose to 17.3p (13p), but, had the extraordinaries been
exceptionals, would have slipped to 12.15p.
A final dividend of 6.4p (5p) is proposed for a total of 9p (7p), a rise of
almost 29 per cent.
The Pounds 216,000 balance of extraordinary charges related to the sale to
its management of the North American operations and the sale of the
industrial paint products business to Croda International. The tile business
was also sold.
Mr Roy Amos, chairman, said the group was now in new shape. The board had
been restructured - partly as a reaction to the bid, but mostly to be ready
for growth and acquisition possibilities. The four-year spate of heavy
capital expenditure, when some Pounds 25m was spent, was over, he said, and
the disposals and closer control of working capital had cut borrowings to
Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 33.3m), reducing gearing to 29 (53) per cent. Interest
charges fell 17 per cent to Pounds 3.37m (Pounds 4.05m).
Group turnover rose 9 per cent to Pounds 110.3m (Pounds 101.6m) with
continuing operations up 24 per cent at Pounds 95m (Pounds 77m) and
discontinued down at Pounds 10m (Pounds 20m). The Manders Centre chipped in
Pounds 5.29m (Pounds 4.91m) and from this made operating profits of Pounds
4.81m (Pounds 4.39m).
The coatings and inks side, reduced from nine locations to three, made
profits of Pounds 3.73m (Pounds 3.05m) on turnover of Pounds 41.7m (Pounds
39.5m). The decorative division, with a full-year from Windeck, the
own-label paint maker, made Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 2.21m) on turnover of Pounds
53.5m (Pounds 37.4m).

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Conrad plans capital restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONRAD Continental yesterday announced a placing and offer to raise Pounds
820,000 together with a capital reorganisation.
At the same time, the Manchester-based leisure and sports group reported
full year pre-tax losses up from Pounds 378,000 to Pounds 486,000, although
the figure for the 12 months to end-December included exceptional costs of
Pounds 111,000 related to reorganisation and restructuring together with
provisions made against certain debtors.
Turnover declined from Pounds 9.16m to Pounds 7.48m. Losses per share were
1.57p against 1.7p.
Mr Rodney Walker, chairman, said the climate throughout the year had
remained harsh and the group had faced difficulty in financing its
activities, which had restricted the level of trading in recent months.
The group plans to issue 24.99m new ordinary shares. Of these, 12m have been
conditionally placed at 4p apiece, while shareholders are asked to subscribe
for the remaining 12.99m at the offer price of 4p.
Under the capital reorganisation, existing shareholders will receive one new
ordinary 1p share and nine deferred 1p shares in exchange for every existing
10p share.
The rights of each 1p ordinary will be equal to the rights of each existing
10p ordinary.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Improved pensions hit John Lewis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN LEWIS Partnership, the employee-owned department store and supermarket
group, yesterday disclosed a decline in profits for the fourth successive
year and warned that another year of falling profits was in prospect.
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to January 30 fell 8 per cent to Pounds
71.4m, although the trading balance - before pension costs - was slightly
higher at Pounds 111.9m, compared with Pounds 111.4m. This was boosted by a
53 weeks rather than 52 weeks trading year.
Mr Stuart Hampson, chairman, said a Pounds 4.8m increase in pension costs,
reflecting recent improvements to pensions, and a Pounds 1.6m rise in
interest charges due to an increase in average borrowings from Pounds 226m
to Pounds 238m, accounted for the pre-tax decline.
Group turnover increased 3 per cent to Pounds 2.36bn (Pounds 2.28bn).
The 22 department stores saw sales drop below the previous year in the first
half. The second period started well, but faltered as consumer confidence
was damaged in September when sterling withdrew from the ERM. Trade picked
up again over Christmas and in January.
For the 102 Waitrose supermarkets, the second half was one of 'exceptional
difficulty', with sales below the previous year in the face of low food
price inflation and competitive pressure, including what Mr Hampson called
'widespread unlawful Sunday trading'.
Mr Hampson said Pounds 28.2m - down from Pounds 30.2m - would be shared
between the 34,000 employee-partners in the form of the company's annual
bonus. The pay-out, representing 8 per cent of annual pay, is the lowest in
percentage terms since 1958-59 when a 7 per cent distribution was made in
preference stock.
'I wish I could tell partners that we had reached the bottom of the trough,
but the year ahead is still far from certain,' Mr Hampson warned.
The 'clouded' economic outlook, together with fierce competition in food
retailing and heavy one-off costs for introducing new technology at
Wait-rose, meant 'the prospect is of yet another year of falling profit,
perhaps even of sharply falling profit,' he added.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Write-down puts AB Ports in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED BRITISH Ports Holdings yesterday wiped out its annual profits by
taking a provision of Pounds 83.6m against the drop in the value of its
property development portfolio.
The write-down caused ABP to incur a pre-tax loss of Pounds 36.6m in 1992,
compared with a profit of Pounds 31m last time.
Sir Keith Stuart, chairman, said the property revaluations were intended to
'clear the decks.' They had been specifically commissioned so as to remove
uncertainty about the value of the group's property development portfolio,
which had affected City sentiment. ABP shares closed 2p higher at 403p.
Sir Keith said that group properties had now been written down to their
open-market value, independently assessed.
ABP said that the recession had continued to depress some of the
higher-earning trades through the group's ports, with the result that
second-half throughput and profitability were lower. Nevertheless, it
described the ports' performance as resilient.
Ports and transport profits fell from Pounds 70.8m to Pounds 64.7m, before
severance costs of Pounds 4m (Pounds 600,000). About 200 jobs were shed last
year, reducing the number of group employees in the ports to 2,000.
Total tonnage last year was down slightly from 106m to 105m tonnes. Tonnages
relating to the chemical and construction industries, such as fertilisers,
cement and timber, were at reduced levels.
ABP said its larger ports performed particularly well, with another record
level of tonnage at Immingham and Hull, and strong growth at Southampton.
Port-related property income was Pounds 20.1m (Pounds 18.5m). Profit from
other property investments was Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 7.9m).
Net borrowings on the balance sheet of Pounds 349m (Pounds 332m) meant
gearing rose from 55 per cent to 60 per cent. Off-balance sheet borrowings
fell to Pounds 15m (Pounds 26m). The interest charge rose to Pounds 39.1m
(Pounds 36.6m).
Losses per share were 14.3p, compared with earnings of 12.4p in 1991.
Nevertheless, the board said it felt the dividend should reflect the
underlying strength of the business. A proposed final of 5.25p gives a total
for the year of 8.5p (8p).

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Abbeycrest declines to Pounds 1.35m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEYCREST, the UK's biggest manufacturer of gold and silver jewellery, saw
profits before tax for 1992 dive 60 per cent, from Pounds 3.35m to Pounds
1.35m.
The outcome, however, was slightly ahead of analysts' expectations and the
shares firmed 6p to 70p.
Turnover declined 26 per cent to Pounds 44.5m (Pounds 60m), largely because
sales to its one-time largest customer, believed to be Ratners, fell by
Pounds 19.6m.
Operating margins fell from 7.2 per cent to 3.2 per cent, with operating
profits down to Pounds 1.75m (Pounds 4.32m). Net interest payments fell to
Pounds 399,000 (Pounds 967,000).
Gearing has been reduced to 7 per cent (52 per cent). Ms Michele Delmain,
analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'The company's gearing very much
depends on when they get paid. The figure shows they were out there very
effectively collecting their receivables.' She estimated average gearing
over the current year would be about 30 per cent.
A final dividend of 2p is proposed for an unchanged total of 3.2p. Earnings
per share were 3.8p (9.8p).

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pentland poised to buy US consumer group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENTLAND, the sporting and consumer goods company which last year pulled out
of talks to purchase Adidas, is about to announce an acquisition in the US.
The target is believed to be a consumer goods group with sales of some
Dollars 100m (Pounds 70m), which will compliment Pentland's domestic
electrical appliance business in the US.
Speculation has centred on Pentland's intentions for its Pounds 347m cash
mountain - the legacy of its investment in Reebok - since plans to buy
Adidas, the sporting goods group, collapsed in acrimony last October.
However, the latest deal is not expected to reduce Pentland's cash
significantly.
The group, which announced an Pounds 156.4m drop in pre-tax profits for 1992
to Pounds 83.6m under new accounting standards, reported that the sale of
the 20 per cent stake in Adidas had resulted in a profit of Pounds 47.3m,
including currency gains.
The gain on disposals compared with Pounds 220.4m last time.
Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said the group had returned an 85 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 36.3m, after stripping out such
gains.
Sales were Pounds 10.7m higher at Pounds 326.5m.
The final dividend is raised 11 per cent to 1.46p for a total of 2.5p
(2.25p). Earnings fell from 62.28p to 15.79p, although excluding the
investment disposals they rose from 4.71p to 7.36p.
Net cash balances stood at Pounds 347.3m, against Pounds 272.7m last time.
Interest was also sharply higher at Pounds 26.1m (Pounds 6.3m).
Mr Farrant said the group had experienced a difficult year in its shoe
divisions.
Although the current year had begun encouragingly, Pentland was 'a bit
nervous' about the effects of a stronger dollar in the second half.
Speedo was the best performer, with a strong increase in sales worldwide.
Speedo in Europe and Australia had both been returned to profit.
Royalties from the international brand name had hit record levels.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Logica relies on Europe for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH in the UK and continental Europe resulted in pre-tax profits
at Logica, the computing services company, almost doubling in the six months
to December 31 despite a return to losses in North America.
Mr David Mann, managing director, said he was pleased with progress but
warned that the trading environment remained harsh and charges might have to
be taken in the second half to cover restructuring measures to restore
profitability in the US.
The cost would be small, however, compared with the restructuring already
undertaken.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 4.14m (Pounds 2.16m) on turnover up 6 per cent
at Pounds 104.2m (Pounds 98.6m). The interim dividend is raised 9 per cent
to 1.25p (1.15p) payable from earnings per share of 3.7p (2.1p).
Cash rose slightly to Pounds 15.3m at December 31, against Pounds 14.9m 12
months earlier.
More than 80 per cent of turnover is now derived from the UK and continental
Europe where revenues grew by 6 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. UK
operating margins rose to 6.8 per cent.
The black spot is still North America where substantial investment designed
to help penetrate the telecommunications and computer industry failed to
translate into new contracts, resulting in a loss of Pounds 1.4m.
Mr Mann said the company was determined to stay in the US, although not at
any price. It was refocusing on the financial services sector where it has
been growing successfully.
A 10 per cent decline in the Asia Pacific region was mainly due to currency
fluctuations.
Logica and Finsiel, the largest Italian computing services company, have
formed a joint venture called Logicasiel which, Mr Mann said, was operating
successfully. He was keen to develop stronger links with the Italian
company.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Insider move favourite at BTR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANNOUNCEMENT that Sir Owen Green, 68, is to step down as chairman of BTR
in May has not ended speculation over the ultimate succession at the
industrial conglomerate which he helped to build into one of Britain's most
successful companies.
Sir Owen will be replaced by Mr Norman Ireland, 65, who has spent 24 years
on the board of BTR - only four years fewer than the retiring chairman.
BTR's rules mean that Mr Ireland can serve a maximum of three years as
chairman, from when he takes over at the group's AGM.
Some observers see Mr Ireland's elevation as a disappointment for Mr Alan
Jackson, the 56-year-old Australian who is chief executive. Mr Jackson was
tipped as a possible successor to Sir Owen when he was brought over to the
UK in 1991, after having built up BTR Nylex, the group's immensely
profitable Australian business.
Since Mr Jackson arrived, BTR has outshone the market and competitors such
as Hanson, the UK's other large, acquisitive conglomerate. BTR's progress
has been helped by its successful integration of Hawker Siddeley, the
stricken aerospace group which it snapped up for Pounds 1.55bn at the end of
1991.
A shy and sometimes prickly individual, Mr Jackson has not always shown the
ease in dealing with the City which would be expected of the chairman of
Britain's 12th biggest company. On first arriving in Britain, he made what
he later described as the blunder of telling the press that he would be
going for a big acquisition. 'I've lived with that for nine bloody months,'
he said when finally launching the Hawker bid.
However, Mr Ireland's appointment may give Mr Jackson an opportunity to get
to know shareholders better and add to his already formidable reputation as
a manager of businesses and assets.
Mr Bob Faircloth, the 56-year-old Canadian who was made BTR's chief
operating officer in 1991, could be being groomed for the role of next chief
executive. He masterminded the Hawker integration process and seems to be
taking a higher profile in dealings with the City.
Meanwhile BTR's immediate focus is on control of operations - and Mr
Jackson, Mr Faircloth and Ms Kathleen O'Donovan, the 35-year-old appointed
finance director in 1991 - comprise a strong and relatively fresh team.
Observers looking to the next generation of internal management talent point
to Mr Roberto Quarta, the 44-year-old chief executive of BTR's sealing and
controls group, who joined the board last month. His promotion came less
than three months after the appointment of Mr Graeme Pearson, the
53-year-old managing director of BTR Nylex.
Their appointments reinforced the international character of of BTR's
executive team. Out of seven executive directors, two are Australian, two
are American and Mr Faircloth is a Canadian who has taken US citizenship.
BTR could, of course, go outside the group when Mr Ireland retires. Sir
David Nicholson did the job of chairman for 15 years until 1984. But the
internal culture is strong - the group's seven executive directors have been
with the group for an average of 18 years. When the time comes for Mr
Ireland to step down, do not be surprised if a BTR insider fills his shoes.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Christies' auction sales rise to Pounds
636m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIES International, the auction house, yesterday bolstered rumours of a
revival in the world art market with its first rise in auction sales for two
years.
Mr Christopher Davidge, group chief executive, said signs of a return in
buyers' confidence were especially noticeable in the US. However, there had
been few major collections from estates available for auction in recent
months.
Mr David Tyler, finance director, said this meant the company was cautious
about the outlook for the first half.
However, the current year would benefit from the recent increase in the
buyers' premium charged in Christie's main locations.
In 1992 the value of auction sales increased by 9 per cent from Pounds 583m
to Pounds 636m. The most expensive item was Canaletto's The Old Horse
Guards, London, sold to Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber for Pounds 10.1m. Matisse's
Harmonie Jaune sold for a record Dollars 14.5m.( Pounds 10.2m)
Pre-tax profits rose 5 per cent to Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 6.36m), on turnover
of Pounds 109m (Pounds 103m).
Strong increases were recorded in jewellery, oriental art, furniture, books
and 19th and 20th century paintings. Some 69 lots sold for more than Dollars
1m, against 61 last time.
The pre-tax figure was struck after redundancy charges of Pounds 1.7m.
Earnings per share rose to 2.21p (2.12p). The final dividend is maintained
at 1p for a reduced total of 1.5p (3.3p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in David Brown Group, the gear and pump manufacturer which is coming
to the market through an offer for sale and placing, will be priced on March
30 with dealings expected to begin on April 15.
The pathfinder prospectus, published yesterday, confirms that after the
flotation the group is expected to have a market capitalisation in excess of
Pounds 70m. The flotation is being sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, with
de Zoete &amp; Bevan brokers to the issue.
Last week the group announced increased pre-tax profits on continuing
operations of Pounds 9.31m (Pounds 8.29m) in the year to January 29 on
static sales of Pounds 81m (Pounds 80.5m).

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Enterprise Oil falls 21% but raises
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTERPRISE OIL, one of the UK's leading oil exploration and production
companies, raised its dividend slightly yesterday in spite of a 21 per cent
fall in 1992 after-tax profits from Pounds 110.5m to Pounds 87m.
The company increased its dividend - for the sixth consecutive year - by 1.6
per cent to 16p (15.75p).
Profits came out at the high end of analysts' expectations, but were buoyed
by some Pounds 30m of after-tax gains from asset disposals.
Mr John Walmesley, finance director, said the company had put a focus on its
financial performance last year and, as a result, halved its exploration
spending, sold some assets and cut its headquarters staff by about 30.
The curtailment of the exploration programme was reflected in the drop in
the company's oil and gas reserves from 948.3m barrels to 907.4m barrels,
which disappointed some analysts.
'We now have an attractive mix between the financial and the physical side
of the company,' said Mr Walmesley. 'Those exploration prospects haven't
gone away.' Oil production rose to an average of 145,813 barrels a day last
year.
Exploration spending will increase this year to Pounds 80m, against Pounds
74m, which had dropped from Pounds 116m in 1991. Altogether Enterprise's
capital expenditure budget for last year was lower at Pounds 450m (Pounds
470m).
The company's Scott and Nelson fields in the North Sea are due to come on
stream this year and next, which will boost production to 250,000 b/d by
1994.
Enterprise holds a 10 per cent stake in the discovery announced this week of
440m barrels of oil in the Norwegian Sea - Norway's biggest oil find for
eight years. About 26m barrels of oil from the find are likely to accrue to
Enterprise after clawbacks.
Profits before tax in 1992 were Pounds 144.9m (Pounds 114.4m) and earnings
per share came to 18.5p (24.5p). Turnover reached Pounds 538m (Pounds 488m).
Gearing was approximately 45 per cent.
COMMENT
Enterprise's oil output is set to peak in 1995 once its two most recent
North Sea fields enter production, and after that it will tail off. The key
issue for the City right now is the management's ability to grow the company
beyond that point. Enterprise insists it has the financial firepower to buy
production assets that will offer good growth towards the end of the decade
 -but the City is looking for news of an acquisition in the next 18 months.
Enterprise's management has done very well at finding oil in the past, but a
note of caution was sounded with yesterday's results, when the company
failed to replace its reserves for the first time in several years. City
expectations are already built into the share price which is trading at an
11 per cent premium to net asset value and any increase in price does not
look justified at present. The shares are now resting on the City's faith in
Enterprise's management.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: ADT back in the black with Dollars 109m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the US-based security and auctions business, yesterday reported a
Dollars 109.1m (Pounds 76.8m) net income in 1992, reporting for the first
time under US GAAP.
The figure compared with a loss in 1991 of Dollars 514.3m, struck after
Dollars 564.4m of 'unusual items', related to items like the refocusing of
the business on the two core businesses and the write-off of goodwill on the
acquisition of Britannia Security.
Earnings were 80 cents but would have been in line with market expectations
of Dollars 1.06 had the results been reported as previously under UK GAAP.
ADT said it was changing to US GAAP as most of the common shareholders were
now in North America. The company said it expected to make announcements
regarding a refinancing during the second quarter of the year.
Most of ADT's syndicated bank debt falls due in the second half of 1994 and
the company expects its convertible redeemable preference shares will be
presented for redemption during the same period.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief executive, said electronic security
and auctions businesses had both performed up to expectations.
Auctions sales rose 3.6 per cent to Dollars 342.8m, but profits fell from
Dollars 71.8m to Dollars 68.2m. Market conditions remained difficult in the
US, where ADT is the second largest vehicle auctioneer, and in the UK, where
it is the biggest. Sales in electronic services rose 2.3 per cent, but
profits were 10 per cent higher at Dollars 141m.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: ICI freezes pay of board and most top
management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries said yesterday it had frozen the pay of all its
directors and most senior managers - about 200 worldwide - from January
1993.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, was paid Pounds 526,000 in 1992, a 5.4 per
cent increase on the previous year. The company's employees generally
received about 5.1 per cent.
The company said it felt the freeze was appropriate to current performance
and market rates. ICI last month reported a Pounds 384m pre-tax loss for the
year to December 31, following exceptional charges of Pounds 949m.
The level of all directors pay, including the chairman's, was set at the end
of 1991 by a committee of non-executive directors. The company sets pay for
senior managers.
Total pay for all ICI's directors fell in 1992 by more than 6 per cent to
Pounds 2.8m, mainly because of the departure of Sir Patrick Meaney, who
died, and the retirement of other senior directors. ICI said replacements
would earn less.
The company plans to cut nearly half of its headquarters staff and may
abandon its London headquarters at Millbank.
The Hay management consultants recently reported that directors in the UK
were increasing their total pay at the rate of about 8 per cent, compared
with about 13 per cent last summer.
ICI's capital expenditure figures were mis-stated on March 8. Between 1981
and 1991, total capital spending was Pounds 7.6bn, of which Pounds 3.52bn
was spent in the UK and Pounds 4.08bn abroad.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brabant hits out at Aberdeen's hostile bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRABANT Resources, the oil and gas explorer, yesterday attacked the hostile
takeover bid from fellow USM oil group Aberdeen Petroleum as a desperate
attempt to revive declining production.
'Aberdeen brings nothing to the table except a ravenous hunger for Brabant's
production and cash flow,' the group said in its defence document published
yesterday.
Aberdeen's production had fallen by 11 per cent in 1992, the document
stated, while Brabant's had been 52 per cent higher.
High overheads had also squeezed profits at Aberdeen, which has most of its
assets in North America and a head office in the UK. Brabant said Aberdeen's
overheads averaged at 27 per cent of sales for the last three years, while
its own costs were running at less than 10 per cent.
Brabant also accused Aberdeen of wasting Pounds 400,000 in shareholders
funds to launch the hostile bid.
Aberdeen, for its part, rejected Brabant's comparison of overheads. The
predator claimed that Brabant had capitalised a substantial proportion of
overhead in recent years.
'If Brabant had adopted Aberdeen's own prudent accounting policies,' Mr
David Hooker, managing director said, 'it would have reported a loss of over
Pounds 800,000 for the year, as opposed to a Pounds 366,000 pre-tax profit.'

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: TI suffers 17% fall to Pounds 87.4m - Sales
boosted by six months' contribution from Dowty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI, the specialist engineering company which last year bought Dowty, the
aerospace group, reported a 17 per cent fall to Pounds 87.4m in full-year
pre-tax profits using the new FRS 3 accounting standard.
Stripping out the effect of a Pounds 20m non-cash provision for the loss on
the sale of discontinued operations, profits rose marginally from Pounds
105.2m to Pounds 107.8m. Sales were up 28 per cent at Pounds 1.15bn after
taking in a six months contribution from Dowty.
Sir Christopher Lewinton, chairman and chief executive, said Dowty would
still only marginally dilute earnings in 1993, as projected at the time of
the hostile bid.
Dowty's polymer division had performed better than expected and had broadly
offset the weakness in the aerospace market.
Earnings after the provision for the sale of Thermal Equipment, fell to
15.4p (22.4p). Mr Michael Garner, finance director, said 'normalised' or
headline earnings fell to 18.3p (22.4p). Only 1p of this decline was due to
the Dowty acquisition; the balance was due to the deterioration in the rump
of TI's original businesses.
A final dividend of 7p makes a 10.7p (10.25p) total.
Sir Christopher said TI had two well established world leaders in John Crane
(seals) and Bundy (specialised tubes) and Dowty (aerospace) had the
potential to become a leader.
Balance sheet gearing rose from 15 per cent to 87 per cent for a number of
reasons, including substantial write-offs on Dowty and a one-off charge to
reserves to account for the full cost of post-retirement health care
programmes, mainly in US businesses.
Net borrowings were Pounds 233m, after Pounds 95.4m of exchange translation
on debt held largely in dollars. Interest cover, assuming Dowty's debt was
included for a full year, would be about 10 times.
John Crane continued to perform strongly, with profits of Pounds 47.3m and
organic growth of 13 per cent. Bundy grew 11 per cent organically to Pounds
38.4m. Profits in rump specialist engineering businesses fell 62 per cent to
Pounds 4.1m.
COMMENT
You can quibble about the headline gearing figure - though TI has net assets
unrealistically low after years of goodwill write-offs - and one can
question the absolute level of US debt and the extent of interest rate
arbitrage across the Atlantic, but Crane and Bundy have both shown their
quality by thriving in recession and, given projections for air travel,
aerospace has to be a good long-term business. TI has suffered from worries
over the integration of Dowty. It may continue to suffer for a while, so
that pre-tax profits of Pounds 132.5m, giving 18.6p of normalised earnings
and a prospective multiple of 17, may be a correct level. Longer term, TI
has to be seen as a quality stock.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Institutional influence holds the balance -
The bid for Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RARELY HAS a takeover battle gone so close to the wire or its outcome been
so dependent on one shareholder than in Airtours' Pounds 289m bid for rival
holiday group, Owners Abroad.
As the offer approaches its closing date next Tuesday, Mercury Asset
Management, a 14.2 per cent shareholder, seems to hold the key.
But even if, as seems likely, MAM decides to back Airtours, the outcome of
the bid is finely balanced.
Owners Abroad's directors, combined with loyal shareholders who always stick
with the prey, control enough to make even the smallest institutional vote
count.
Yesterday's purchase by Airtours of 4 per cent of Owners Abroad shares in
the market was less than it wanted and will not be enough to secure the bid.
Perhaps the most tantalising factor that might swing shareholders behind
Airtours, is the prospect of a re-rating of the sector.
Such has been the ease of entry into the holiday business, the alacrity with
which market leader Thomson has unleashed price wars and the disloyalty of
price-conscious consumers that the stock market has rarely granted the
sector a price earnings rating in double figures.
But an enlarged Airtours could have sales of Pounds 1.2bn, net assets of
more than 140m, a huge chest of cash and pre-tax profits of Pounds 100m.
Against such a force, Thomson might initiate an immediate noisy skirmish,
but could well give up trying to remain double the size of its nearest
competitor, settling down instead to enjoy the spoils of shared market
domination.
That could bring greater stability and predictability of earnings. After
numerous holiday company failures in recent years, this prospect might have
figured large in Mr Michael Heseltine's decision not to refer the bid to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Airtours could then rise to the heady
heights of an average market rating.
Certainly Mr David Crossland, Airtours' chairman, has displayed his
deal-making instincts and been less than generous. If he wins, Owners
shareholders will have been taken out on an exit multiple of 10 times
prospective earnings. But that should not necessarily be a reason to let
Owners Abroad off the hook.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad's chairman, says Owners made one mistake in
the pricing of its first summer 1992 brochure, Owners' share price suffered
and Airtours pounced.
While this is partly true, there are fundamental differences in the way in
which the companies operate which suggests that Owners could have been more
tightly run.
Owners' 1992 profit margin at less than half that of AIrtours may be
explained by the pricing error. But according to stockbrokers Hoare Govett,
Airtours has a considerably lower fixed cost base and more productive
employees.
Owners has also failed to convince some institutions that it has adopted the
right philosophy for what is, undoubtedly, a respected charter airline, Air
2000.
Owners has built a large airline and sells its spare capacity in the market.
By contrast Airtours, like Thomson, has chosen to have a fleet size dictated
by the maximum winter requirement. It has, as Mr Crossland says, 'kept the
kerosene away from the veins' and kept the airline as a transport division
of the holiday company.
Even Owners Abroad's strongest card - its proposed commercial link up with
Thomas Cook, the travel agency and its German sister company, the tour
operator LTU - has failed to excite some of the larger shareholders.
Owners claims the benefits would be substantial. But Thomas Cook's
conditional tender offer for 12.5 per cent of the shares at 150p each, 6p
below the current value of Airtours' share offer, probably weakened Owners'
defence by appearing so diffident.
So does Mr Crossland lead a team that could manage the integration? He has
shown an unparallelled market instinct in building Airtours almost entirely
through organic growth. Putting the two companies together would require
different skills.
Owners shareholders that accept the offer are making a leap of faith. A
considerable springboard for that leap comes from the skewed nature of
holiday company profits.
Nobody will be fooled by the sharp jump in earnings that will follow
Airtours absorbing all of Owners 1993 summer profits, but none of its winter
1992-93 losses.
But next year, Airtours has scope to reduce Owners aircraft fleet - or more
importantly excess winter capacity - thereby attacking the source of
greatest potential losses.
And Owners Abroad's point that Airtours might in two years' time have
started to find it increasingly tough to achieve organic growth is not the
issue now for Owners shareholders.
With the Airtours share price consistently rising, the market appears to be
saying that the bid will succeed. If it does, Airtours' new shareholders
must steel themselves.
Almost the first thing they will see splashed across the newspapers, is an
announcement of the annual summer holiday price war. To many this might seem
that the management of their company is being remarkably cavalier with their
precious profit margins. They have to decide whether to risk this bumpy
ride.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: SFO probe into the affairs of Norton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office has launched an investigation into transactions
involving Norton Group, the motorcycles and engineering company which has
been severely criticised in a Department of Trade and Industry report.
It is understood that the SFO inquiry will focus on the Pounds 8.2m
acquisition of a German company, which profited the family of chairman Mr
James Tildesley, and the rights issue which funded that deal.
The DTI report, published yesterday, criticised the men who ran Norton
between 1987 and 1990 and their advisers. The DTI is considering
disqualifying certain of the directors from managing any other company.
The inspectors say: 'The management of the company was conducted in a very
unsatisfactory manner.' They blame Mr Philippe Le Roux, chief executive, for
much of the deficiencies.
They pick out several points of concern in the 1990 FUS acquisition,
including:
The obvious conflict of interest between Norton and its chairman. 'From the
outset, Mr Tildesley seems to have planned for a profit out of this
transaction, first for himself and later . . . for his children's trusts',
which were the vendors of FUS.
The inspectors put the profit at Pounds 1.9m, although they say Pounds
725,000 should be deducted to allow for sums unrecovered from Norton by Mr
Tildesley.
The involvement of Mr Le Roux's company Manstorm in the sub-underwriting of
the 1990 rights offer.
The directors of Manstorm were Mr Le Roux and his mother Mrs Fylippa
Cumming. Mr Le Roux resigned from Norton after failing to pay Pounds 195,000
to an agent who purchased the company's shares for him.
TC Coombs, stockbroker, which went into receivership, underwrote the Pounds
7.5m issue. Manstorm sub-underwrote Pounds 1.75m. The inspectors say: 'That
company had no assets to meet such a liability.'
They also criticise a 'comfort letter' from Blyth Dutton, Norton's
solicitors. It wrongly gave Coombs the impression that Manstorm could meet
its liabilities. The letter was written by Mr Peter Hooper, who was also
Norton's company secretary.
The circular to shareholders about the FUS acquisition had many
deficiencies, according to the inspectors.
They also raise questions about Norton's merger with Minty, the furniture
and property company.
A variety of financial advisers, accountants, surveyors and lawyers are
criticised in the 240-page report, which has been sent to the relevant
professional bodies as well as the Stock Exchange. Norton's financial
adviser was Robert Fleming and its auditors Hacker Young.
The inspectors were Mr Richard George Bramwell McCombe and Mr John Kenneth
Heywood, of accountants Price Waterhouse.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Eurocamp shares tumble 65p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROCAMP, the camping holiday group, yesterday warned that UK bookings for
the summer season were 20 per cent down on this time last year. The shares
fell 65p to 259p.
Mr Tom Neville, chairman, told shareholders at the annual meeting that
Eurocamp was now planning on strong late bookings and 'could still achieve a
final profits figure only a little below that recorded in 1992'.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 9.4m in the year to October 31.
However, he warned that without this improvement in booking volumes, 'a
somewhat larger reduction in profits could arise'.
Mr Neville said low consumer confidence had depressed the market. The
pound's fall against the French franc had affected demand for Eurocamp's
holidays which are mainly in France.
Bookings from customers in the Netherlands and Germany had been
disappointing since the new year, he said, with Dutch bookings flat and
German bookings up 5 per cent.
Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director, said it was premature to talk about
the current year dividend, which totalled 9.75p last year.
He said the group aimed to achieve occupancy rates similar to last year's
level, with some adjustment to capacity.
There would be some squeeze on margins, although a lot of Eurocamp's costs
varied with numbers of holidays sold.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Packaging activities leave Blagden lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLAGDEN INDUSTRIES, the packaging and chemicals group, suffered a 29 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 7.63m for the 53 weeks to January 3.
The directors said the the packaging division had been adversely hit by
recession. The result was foreshadowed in November when the group issued a
gloomy trading statement.
Sales improved from Pounds 218.3m to Pounds 229.8m.
Operating profits from international packaging fell from Pounds 8.6m to
Pounds 7.2m while those of UK packaging declined from Pounds 3m to Pounds
1.7m. The industrial protective equipment operations experienced a downturn
in profits from Pounds 852,000 to Pounds 677,000. Chemical activities bucked
the trend with a rise to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3m).
Net interest charges rose to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.8m) reflecting increased
rates on the group's foreign currency debt. Borrowings increased to Pounds
34.6m (Pounds 25.2m), mainly because of foreign currency conversion and
increased capital expenditure. Gearing rose to 50 per cent (36 per cent).
An exceptional charge of Pounds 606,000 related to reorganisation costs.
Earnings per share fell to 7.2p (14p), partly because of the higher tax
charge relating to the larger write-offs of advanced corporation tax.
The final dividend is maintained at 5p making an unchanged total of 9.5p.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Volvo falls into SKr4.75bn loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish motor vehicle group, announced a SKr4.75bn (Pounds 430m)
deficit after financial items in 1992, the worst result in its history. The
loss followed difficult market conditions, heavy restructuring costs and
huge foreign exchange losses.
The performance, which compares with a SKr1.5bn profit in 1991, led the
group to halve its dividend to SKr7.75 per share, the first time it has ever
reduced its pay-out. The group's B shares fell SKr6 to end at SKr394.
The group said the result would have no impact on continuing discussions
over deeper collaboration with the French carmaker Renault.
Volvo suffered a SKr4bn loss after financial items in the fourth quarter of
1992, after taking one-off charges amounting to nearly SKr3.8bn.
Restructuring costs, mainly related to the group's planned closure of its
Kalmar and Uddevalla plants, amounted to SKr1.45bn. It suffered a further
SKr650m in foreign exchange losses and SKr1.14bn in losses related to
associate companies.
Underlying industry conditions for both cars and trucks were bleak, the
group stated.
'Demand for heavy trucks in Europe declined sharply during the last three
months of 1992,' it added.
Sales rose to SKr83.0bn from SKr77.2bn, although adjusted for disposals and
acquisitions, they were unchanged. Sales of the group's car operations rose
to SKr44.6bn from SKr37.0bn, but the group's truck unit saw a 5 per cent
drop in sales to SKr30.4bn. The group's operating loss deepened to SKr2.25bn
from SKr1.17bn.
Operating losses within Volvo Car Group rose to SKr1.83bn from SKr1.77bn,
although excluding the currency impact, they improved to a SKr1.17bn
deficit. The group noted that in the fourth quarter its car division posted
an operating loss of just SKr81m, excluding currency factors, which was
substantially better than in preceding quarters.
However, Volvo Truck Group saw a sharp turnaround, slumping to a SKr641m
operating loss from a SKr664m profit in 1991.
The group did not make a forecast for 1993, but its result is expected to
rebound, due to the absence of one-off items and the weakening of the
Swedish krona.

FT  12 MAR 93 / WPP to raise Pounds 88m in rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP, the marketing services group, yesterday announced a four-for-five
rights issue to raise Pounds 88m.
The company also reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 53.8m for the year
ending December 31, 1992, up from Pounds 38.36m in 1991. On an FRS 3 basis,
however, pre-tax profits were only Pounds 7.7m (against Pounds 56m), and
after a tax charge of Pounds 17.2m there was an Pounds 11.9m loss.
The rights issue is to be used for partial repayment on a Pounds 105m
bridging loan and for additional working capital.
It was signalled last summer, just before shareholders approved the group's
refinancing package. Four new ordinary shares will be offered for every five
ordinary shares. The new shares are priced at 45p each, a 25 per cent
discount on Wednesday's closing price. The issue is fully underwritten by
Samuel Montagu, which is retaining 20 per cent of the sub-underwriting.
Revenues increased 5.7 per cent last year to Pounds 1.27bn; revenues for the
first two months of 1993 are 4 per cent over the comparable period in 1992.
No dividend is to be paid, but the board forecast a dividend payment of 1p
for the 1993 financial year.
Exceptional losses of Pounds 30.58m included costs of Pounds 13.5m from the
August refinancing package; Pounds 15.73m of rationalisation costs
associated with some of the group's smaller companies; and Pounds 1.35m of
provisions for surplus property. Average net debt stood at Pounds 240m (from
Pounds 334m) at the end of 1992. Earnings per share before exceptional items
were 1.7p; on an FRS 3 basis, losses per share were 9.3p (against earnings
of 27.9p).
Group operating margins declined from 7 per cent to 6.9 per cent. Within the
group, the advertising agencies J Walter Thompson had operating margins of
8.7 per cent and Ogilvy &amp; Mather 5.7 per cent.
Analysts are revising upwards forecasts for 1993 pre-tax profits to about
Pounds 67m. Mr Martin Sorrell, WPP group chief executive, said yesterday
that the planned disposal of the US advertising agency Scali McCabe Sloves
was progressing and proceeds would go towards repayment of the bridging
loan.
It is understood that the Interpublic Group of advertising agencies is
interested in buying Scali, for about Pounds 80m.

FT  12 MAR 93 / BTR names new chairman as profits rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN IRELAND was named as the next chairman of BTR, on the day that the
UK industrial conglomerate announced that its pre-tax profits had
comfortably broken through the Pounds 1bn barrier. Mr Ireland, 65, who
stepped down as chairman of the paper group Bowater last month, replaces Sir
Owen Green, 68, who will retire in May after 28 years on the board.
Mr Ireland can serve as chairman for a maximum of three years. Mr Ireland,
Sir Owen and Mr John Cahill were the original triumvirate who built BTR into
one of Britain's most successful companies.
BTR's profits grew 18 per cent to Pounds 1.09bn last year on sales which
were 31 per cent higher at Pounds 8.84bn. The figures included a full-year
contribution from Hawker Siddeley, the UK engineering group which BTR took
over for Pounds 1.55bn at the end of 1991.
Ms Kathleen O'Donovan, finance director, said Hawker had contributed about
Pounds 2bn of sales and Pounds 230m of profits before interest. BTR's
trading margin had been maintained at 14.2 per cent, through a combination
of lifting lower margins in the former Hawker operations and improved
performance by existing BTR businesses.
In spite of the success of the Hawker acquisition, Mr Alan Jackson, chief
executive, said the group was not planning a big acquisition in the
immediate future.
In the absence of economic recovery, BTR continued to reduce its cost base.
A total of 8,600 jobs were shed last year, leading to redundancy and
rationalisation costs of Pounds 36m (against Pounds 56m). Group gearing at
December 31 was 69 per cent, compared with 79 per cent at the half-year and
89 per cent a year earlier. This was achieved by strong cashflow, reduced
working capital, and selling peripheral businesses and assets worth Pounds
270m.
Good progress had been made in some European businesses, but the impact of
the deepening German recession on the rest of Europe remained a concern. The
US recovery was gaining momentum, but in Australia the construction and
commercial interiors sectors continued to be difficult.
Earnings per share rose 9 per cent to 34.3p (from 31.5p). A final dividend
of 10.25p (against 9p) makes a total for the year of 18p, an increase of 9
per cent.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Tough tactics needed to stay in the top three: Rolls-Royce
is restructuring to cope with a changed aerospace industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Restructuring has become a way of life for Mr Terry Harrison, Rolls-Royce
chief executive. 'I seem to spend all my time doing it,' he says.
The latest upheaval came yesterday when the the UK aero-engine group fell
into the red with a 1992 pre-tax loss of Pounds 184m, reflecting provisions
of Pounds 268m; cut its dividend; and announced it would reduce its
51,800-strong workforce by 5,000.
The news was not a total surprise. Rolls-Royce has already shed 12,000 jobs
in the past two years. Along with the rest of the aerospace industry, it has
been buffeted by what Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, concedes is 'the longest
and most damaging recession we've ever suffered'.
Rolls-Royce's two main US competitors, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney,
have also announced plans to cut 4,000 and 10,000 jobs respectively over the
next 18 months.
'In some parts of the world, we don't know what kind of airline industry
will emerge from this recession which has already taken some large airlines
like Pan Am and Eastern out of the game,' Sir Ralph warns.
The concurrent cut in defence spending following the end of the cold war is
also likely to be permanent. 'The defence business has not gone away for
good, but what is clear is that it will be half the size it was,' he says.
The turmoil in the aerospace industry has revived memories of 1971 when
Rolls-Royce was forced into bankruptcy. The company was dragged down by huge
development problems on its RB211 civil aircraft engine. At that time, it
was heavily dependent on the aero-engine business, and lacked a broad range
of civil aircraft engines.
Sir Ralph is adamant that the company will never repeat the mistakes of the
past. It launched a recovery strategy eight years ago to improve its
aero-engine model range, reduce costs, improve efficiency and broaden its
industrial base. 'We believe this strategy continues to be the right one,'
says Sir Ralph. 'The fact there is short-term turbulence in the market
should not divert us from our long-term aims.'
The strategy has started to pay off. Restructuring has led to a 13 per cent
improvement in output per employee. Continuing rationalisation will close
some sites, including the helicopter engine plant at Leavesden in
Hertfordshire and the aero-engine component facility at Parkside, Coventry.
At the same time, the company is consolidating some smaller facilities into
larger ones.
But the job cuts will not go on for ever. 'We want to become more efficient
but we also want to maintain our production capability to take advantage of
the recovery when it occurs,' Sir Ralph emphasised.
In the industrial power activities, the workforce has already fallen from
27,700 in 1990 to 22,300 at the end of last year, and is likely to remain
stable. In the aerospace division, it has dropped from 36,500 in 1990 to
29,500 at the end of last year, and the company's eventual target is around
25,000.
The company has also broadened its civil engine range. Its engines now cover
about 80 per cent of the commercial aircraft market compared with barely 30
per cent a decade ago. Even in a depressed market, Rolls-Royce is selling
more engines than before. 'Until 1989, we were selling about 100-150 engines
a year; it's now around 400 a year because we can offer products to power
many more different airliners than in the past,' says Sir Ralph. In the
longer term, this will lead to a steep increase in the company's engine
spare parts business, a traditional source of high margin business.
Rolls-Royce has also seen its share of the civil engine market increase. Sir
Ralph said the company had captured about 22-23 per cent of the civil
aero-engine market compared with 26-28 per cent each for GE and Pratt &amp;
Whitney.
Equally important has been the expansion of the company's industrial power
operations, initially through the acquisition of Northern Engineering
Industries (NEI) in 1989 and then through the alliance with the US
Westinghouse group eight months ago.
The industrial power group already accounts for about 40 per cent of the
company's Pounds 3.5bn annual turnover. Rolls-Royce wants these activities,
which last year helped offset the slump in the company's aero-engine
business, to grow eventually to around 50 per cent of turnover. This could
involve more joint ventures and possible acquisitions, explains Mr Harrison,
former head of NEI.
The other big challenge facing Rolls-Royce is the Pounds 400m development of
the Trent, its new heavy thrust civil engine to power the next generation of
large wide-body airliners. With these new big jets expected to account for a
growing share of the civil aircraft market over the next 20 years,
Rolls-Royce cannot afford to slow down on the development of the Trent which
is absorbing about half the company's total annual Pounds 200m research and
development expenditure. The competition for this new market is already
intense. Rolls-Royce's two US rivals are also developing large engines and
some aerospace analysts believe that three competing engines are too many.
Some argue that three big aero-engine manufacturers are also too many and
one will eventually have to merge with a competitor.
'I think the three majors will survive but I can't see a place for the
smaller players,' says Sir Ralph, adding that the next few years are likely
to see the consolidation of smaller companies into the big three.
Sir Ralph also believes that the short-term problems facing the three main
aero-engine manufacturers are greater than the longer term. 'I don't see a
change in the world's desire to travel by airplane: the opportunity for us
is clearly still there,' he says.
He concedes that when the market does ultimately pick up, it is unlikely to
roar ahead as in previous cycles. Instead, it will probably take the
industry along a slow, scenic route. In the meantime, there will be no
escape from restructuring. 'This business is not for the faint-hearted,' Mr
Harrison says.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Sales rise fuels hope of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES for an end to the recession were encouraged yesterday when the
Confederation of British Industry said retailers last month saw strong sales
growth for the second month running.
Confidence in the sector in February about economic prospects reached its
highest point since May, while more retailers are planning to increase
investment than at any time for four years.
The CBI said its monthly survey of business conditions across the
distributive trades, which also takes in car dealers and wholesalers,
provided grounds for 'cautious optimism'.
The sharp year-on-year increase in sales volumes in both January and
February reflected heavy discounting among retailers, and also extremely
weak demand at the beginning of 1992.
Last month, the year-on-year increase in sales volumes in retailing, which
accounts for about a quarter of the economy, was the highest recorded by the
CBI since April. It fits in with evidence that consumer spending may be
picking up.
Motor traders saw sales strengthen last month compared with February last
year, with the increase on an annual basis the highest since August 1988.
But wholesalers - which sell mainly to small shops - registered a
year-on-year sales decline.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, a director of the Kingfisher stores group who is
chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said: 'I am pleased with
progress in the retailing sector since Christmas but it is too early to say
whether we are on a firm upward trend.'
Employment across the distributive trades continued to fall last month as
companies tried to cut costs against a background of generally fragile
demand.
Price increases among retailers were at their lowest since the survey
started 10 years ago. That reflected big price-cutting campaigns in many
stores.
Mr Whittaker said the 15 per cent fall in sterling since September had not
so far shown up in higher prices at the retail level. Many shops and
distributors had absorbed higher import costs.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Ford shelves plan for forced job cuts after market growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD UK yesterday suspended its plan for compulsory redundancies for manual
workers, saying a recent improvement in the British car market would enable
it to increase planned production.
After talks with union leaders, Mr Bob Hill, Ford's industrial relations
director, said: 'Five successive months of improvement in car sales was the
key factor in our decision.'
As a result of the 'slight but still fragile' growth in the market, he said,
Ford did not need to cut its 24,000 manual workforce by 980, as originally
called for last December, but instead by 685. Ford now predicts 4 per cent
growth in the UK market this year to 1.65m new cars.
Voluntary redundancies, redeployment of workers and an increase in
production would enable Ford to achieve the staff cuts needed without any
compulsory redundancies, he said.
Mr Hill added that 'maintaining a good relationship' with its workforce was
also an important reason for Ford's move. But the company refused to concede
a union demand to guarantee no future compulsory redundancies.
Ford also agreed that its leaked plan to contract out 1,300 service jobs to
other companies was to be abandoned. Instead the company will conduct
negotiations at plant level about the most efficient way of carrying out the
work.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief negotiator for the AEEU engineering union, said that
Ford's change of mind was 'a great victory for common sense'. He claimed the
company had backed down because of the 'clear determination of the workforce
to resist compulsory redundancies'.
He added that the company's decision to drop the compulsory redundancy
threat was also a sign Ford wanted 'co-operation not confrontation. It is
anxious to avoid any disruption to the launch of the new Mondeo this
spring.'
The company's move came less than 24 hours after Mr Ian McAllister, Ford UK
chairman and managing director, told the House of Commons employment
committee why the company considered compulsory redundancies were needed.
Ford said it had revised daily production targets at its main plants from
April 1. These still mean fewer cars will be built than now but the cuts
will not be as great as planned last December.
At Halewood, Merseyside, the target will be 780 vehicles a day compared with
810 produced daily there now. At Dagenham, Essex, the new target is 750
against 980 a day built now.
The compulsory redundancies decision does not apply to white-collar staff
who voted this week to authorise industrial action.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Yeltsin faces further challenge: Russian parliament to
debate fresh measures to erode president's powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's rivals in the conservative-dominated parliament
will today debate further moves to strip him of much of his power as
Russia's power struggle moves to a climax.
Politicians in Moscow were split last night on whether Mr Yeltsin would
accept yet another compromise which erodes his powers. Mr Vassily Lipitsky,
a leader of the centrist Civic Union bloc, said: 'The president has to agree
 -he has no other legal choice. With this congress in this mood, this is the
best he will get.'
The alternative course for Mr Yeltsin is to take the 'decisive measures' at
which he has hinted, to break the constraints stifling economic and
constitutional reform.
In Washington, President Clinton, offering another endorsement of Mr
Yeltsin's attempts at democratic reform, said he could not predict whether
Mr Yeltsin would survive his battle with conservatives.
He spoke as officials of the Group of Seven industrial nations prepared to
discuss urgent aid for Russia at a weekend meeting in Hong Kong.
In the Congress of People's Deputies yesterday, Mr Yeltsin, in a stumbling
speech interrupted by dissenting cries but received largely in silence,
insisted on the primacy of his office and on the urgency of constitutional
and economic change.
He was backed by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, but both men
were fiercely criticised by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary
speaker, who accused the first of tyrannous intent and the other of not
being master of his own cabinet.
Mr Yeltsin sat glumly through proceedings as a deputy demanded his
dismissal, walking out of the chamber shortly afterwards.
The Congress voted in principle for a resolution which gives the government
some of the control over central bank and budget which Mr Yeltsin and Mr
Chernomyrdin had demanded.
But it deprives the president of the right to hold a referendum, reinstates
frozen constitutional changes which could see him dismissed by congress for
'acting unconstitutionally', and permits further legislative sorties into
his diminished powers.
A compromise reached on the basis of the resolution would be seen as a
victory for the anti-presidential forces.
Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, the president's press secretary, said that some key
points of the resolution - on the referendum and on the constitutional
changes in particular - 'destroyed all of the rest' of the proposed
agreement.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy premier for finance and the economy, said:
'This is a question of life and death - a matter of whether order will be
restored in this country or if we will slide further into the abyss. No one
can say how the events in the congress will go - the government has no plans
for specific action depending on different outcomes.'

FT  12 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: WPP Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any company launching a heavily-dilutive rights issue chiefly to repay a
bridging loan could reasonably expect a roasting from shareholders. Yet such
is the topsy-turvy state of advertising companies that WPP's Pounds 88m cash
call was greeted by a 17 per cent rise in its share price.
A fund-raising exercise was forecast when WPP last restructured itself. Its
announcement therefore came as a relief. The issue is fully underwritten -
even though Samuel Montagu will back 20 per cent of the sub-underwriting -
further reinforcing confidence.
The temptation is to view WPP as a cheap recovery stock. WPP's results
suggest it is trading reasonably well - at least in comparison with Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi. The upturn in the US will help. Nevertheless, WPP will still have
negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 157m after the rights issue. More
worryingly, it will experience a further cash outflow this year after
earn-out payments. Another downward lurch in advertising would prove
severely embarrassing. Still, no one pretends WPP's shares are for anyone
but grown-ups.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite its latest venture in US coal, RTZ remains a hostage to the metals
cycle. With aluminium and copper prices down last year, maintaining earnings
per share must be considered a creditable performance. But costs and
productivity can only be squeezed so far.
The stronger dollar should help profits on translation this year, but a
recovery in prices looks some way off. European and Japanese economies are
sliding into recession, so RTZ may have to wait some way into 1994.
Capital expenditure running at around Pounds 250m, a high tax charge and a
Pounds 195m dividend leaves little surplus cash for debt reduction in the
meantime. One can only hope the peripheral oil and gas reserves acquired
with Nerco prove easy to sell. Gearing of 63 per cent is not yet excessive.
But until it is reduced, RTZ has limited room for manoeuvre.

FT  12 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a pity that Rolls-Royce's shares spend so much of their time below the
flotation price. Some decent capital appreciation through the biggest
aircraft order boom in history might have persuaded shareholders that they
were being rewarded for taking substantial risks. Instead they have the
wooden spoon of a reduced dividend barely covered by earnings - and that is
if one charitably excludes exceptional items.
Nor should investors have any illusions that yesterday's tough action is the
prelude to another great engineering recovery story. Consumers may be
perking up, but they are not going to buy fleets of 747s. Rather the risk is
of further order cancellations, and the market may not even bottom until
1994. The Pounds 50m provision against customer payments may not be the
last.
The company highlights its strong balance sheet, but small might be a more
illuminating description. Most of its competitors in jet engines and power
engineering are in much larger groups and some have even stronger balance
sheets. It is they, not Rolls, which have the muscle. The research costs and
market risks rest on a slender capital base. But then, 'twas ever thus.

FT  12 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: BTR
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Ireland will enjoy only three years at the helm of BTR before the
company's compulsory retirement age of 68 forces him to move on. But his is
an experienced and safe pair of hands and BTR should have a fair wind behind
it when he climbs back aboard in the summer. It would be unfair to dwell on
BTR's draw-down on just over Pounds 300m in acquisition provisions last
year, which was rather more than Hanson. Its figures also show a healthy
cash inflow. It was easily able to afford the Pounds 235m outlay on
restructuring Hawker Siddeley.
There should be further efficiency gains this year, while profits will be
helped by exchange rate movements even if volume growth remains modest.
Gearing should drop quite rapidly as the year wears on, giving BTR
considerable acquisition fire-power just as it completes the integration of
Hawker. Even now its strong share price would give it some flexibility to
finance a purchase with paper.
Mr Ireland's arrival does little to change the outlook. For the next three
years BTR will presumably carry on in very much its traditional style. But
it looks less likely now that Mr Alan Jackson will eventually step up to
fill the chairman's slot. In three years' time BTR will again be looking for
a new chairman. The long-term succession uncertainty has only been deferred.

FT  12 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: The Glaxo treatment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo has a careless way with chief executives. Having lost Mr Bernard
Taylor in 1989 by promoting Dr Ernest Mario, the company has now to explain
the abrupt departure of the latter. One might reasonably wonder whether any
company can afford this attrition of top talent. The chairman who dominates
the business is little more than two years from retirement, but the
succession is as unclear as ever. At least the episode clarifies an issue of
strategy: if ever there was a residual risk of a rights issue to fund a big
acquisition in over-the-counter medicines, that surely departs with Dr
Mario.
Glaxo insists management style rather than strategy was the reason for the
upheaval. The new structure is designed, it says, to devolve responsibility
out of the hands of the chief executive. That amounts to an admission events
were starting to go awry. Glaxo's once stratospheric rating was built on
apparently seamless relations with drugs industry regulators and ruthlessly
efficient marketing. Yet the launch of some new drugs has failed to live up
to the high expectations planted by the company itself. The wrangle with the
US regulator over the marketing of Zantac might equally be taken as a sign
of slippage.
If the reshuffle allows a re-invigorated management to get to grips with
these issues, Glaxo can only benefit. But the company must convince that it
has a credible strategy for OTC medicines - and that it can handle the
succession without further blood-letting - if it is to stand a fighting
chance of making up lost ground.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Rail link to Heathrow poised for go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL and BAA, the privatised airports operator, are poised to
announce a go-ahead for the delayed plans to build a Pounds 300m express
rail link between Paddington in London and Heathrow airport.
The line, due to open in 1996, will cut existing journey times between
central London and Heathrow from an hour or more to 16 minutes. The one-way
fare is likely to be about Pounds 7 at today's prices.
It is understood that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, wishes to refer to
the scheme in his Budget next week.
BR and BAA have resolved their long-standing differences over the funding of
the line and have signed an outline agreement which now has to be ratified
by the Treasury before an announcement can be made.
Approval is likely to be just a formality because the government is keen to
hold up a successful example of how the public and private sectors can work
together in financing trans-port infrastructure projects.
The go-ahead will be particularly warmly welcomed by Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, who needs some positive news to counter gloom over
delays to the Jubilee Line extension to Docklands in London and controversy
over the privatisation of BR.
Under the plans, the Heathrow Express will run for three quarters of the
16-mile journey on existing BR lines from Paddington. A private-sector
consortium led by BAA will build and operate a spur taking the trains from
BR's tracks to the airport.
Late last year the plans had looked on the brink of collapse because of a
bitter dispute between BR and BAA over how the line was to be financed.
BAA said BR was demanding too much money for the use of its tracks, while BR
said BAA was trying to skimp on its contribution to the project.
A compromise is understood to have emerged after intervention by Mr
MacGregor who called a meeting with Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, and Sir John
Egan, BAA's chief executive.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Taurus done to death
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE past decade and a half, the business of running a stock exchange
has undergone a dramatic transformation. Instead of being cosy, monopolistic
utilities run by club committees, most exchanges now operate in
internationally contestable markets. They have less power over their members
and less ready access to their members' pockets; to survive, they have to
demonstrate credible managerial skills. Against the background of this harsh
new market discipline, the London Stock Exchange's botched attempt to
introduce a paperless settlement system, Taurus, suggests that the shelf
life of this august body may be rather less than previously assumed.
To say that the exchange was over-ambitious with its computer plans
laughably understates the case. Nor is the cost of the debacle restricted to
the Pounds 400m or more that has gone into preparations for Taurus in the
City and in industry, where listed companies have incurred expenditure in
anticipation of paperless trading. The antediluvian system that now gains a
new lease of life is administratively inefficient for investors, brokers and
companies, and needlessly ties up capital in the securities system. It falls
woefully short of the target set by the Group of 30, an influential think
tank of former policy makers, for three-day rolling settlement.
Given that the development of this computerised system constituted a crucial
challenge for the exchange's chief executive Mr Peter Rawlins, it is
appropriate that he should have tendered his resignation. In the City,
unlike the cabinet, it seems that the buck does actually stop somewhere. The
question is how much damage has been done.
International role
As far as the City's international role is concerned, there will no doubt be
celebration in Paris and Frankfurt, but no great gain in business. While
settlement is important - and better managed in those two continental
European cities - it is not the central factor in deciding where securities
business is done.
Institutional investors attach more importance to liquidity, dealing costs,
research and other services. A recent survey by the London Stock Exchange
into dealing costs in other markets suggests that London remains the most
competitive centre for large transactions, even without the reduction in
stamp duty that the government had promised, to coincide with the
introduction of Taurus.
Despite the shortcomings of settlement in London, the stock exchange's SEAQ
International dealing system claims to have 90 per cent of Europe's
cross-border equity turnover. If settlement were crucial, trading in
overseas stocks would not account for 50 per cent of the London Stock
Exchange's business.
London's strength
London's real strength in securities trading is not on its organised
exchanges but in over-the-counter markets trading in eurobonds, swaps,
currency forwards and the rest. Here the service providers range from
information technology groups like Reuters to international banks. They
constitute as great, or possibly a greater competitive threat to the London
Stock Exchange, than the market authorities in Paris and Frankfurt.
The decision to ask the Bank of England what to do makes some sense.
Settlement is not unlike a public good: the incentive for the potential
beneficiaries is not sufficient for them to set up a system on their own
initiative. Cooperative effort is therefore needed. The snag is that the
Bank of England was deeply involved in trying to reconcile the conflicting
interests in the system that went so disastrously wrong by trying to
accommodate too many of their demands.
Whether the collapse of Taurus will give the Bank new leverage to persuade
bank registrars, companies and securities houses to make sacrifices in the
wider interest remains to be seen. But it would seem, at the very least,
that the task of developing a new system should be offered around more
widely. There is plenty of expertise in payments and settlements in the
international banking fraternity and elsewhere. The poor light cast on the
Stock Exchange's management by the Taurus disaster suggests that a
diminished role for the exchange would be in order.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Leading Article: The economic pain in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST REGARDLESS of what happens in the general election this year, the
domination of Felipe Gonzalez over Spanish politics since 1982 is probably
ending. The question is what legacy that period will bequeath. Will Spain
emerge as a fully integrated and economically successful part of Europe, or
will it continue to be viewed as a laggard? For all the efforts of Mr
Gonzalez and close colleagues like Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister,
this choice is yet to be made. Only now, in relatively bad economic times,
is it inescapable.
Spain is a very different country from Italy. But in one respect at least
its problems are similar. There is popular enthusiasm for full participation
in the European endeavour and a strong rhetorical commitment to that ideal
amongst the country's leaders. The question is whether the rhetoric will
match reality, now that painful choices have at last emerged between the
European commitment and short-term economic exigencies.
From the time of Spain's entry to the EC in 1986 until 1991, Spain enjoyed
dynamic economic expansion. Economic growth averaged some 4 per cent a year,
public spending expanded still faster, particularly on social services and
infrastructure. Even the current account deficit of between 3 and 4 per cent
of gross domestic product was readily financed.
Following entry of the peseta into the ERM in 1989, the principal problem
facing the authorities was not the need to keep interest rates up, but undue
pressure to push them down. With excessive monetary growth and inflation
stuck at over 5 per cent, their aim was tight monetary control. But the
consequence of relatively high interest rates was a persistently strong
currency. These perverse monetary consequences of ERM membership even became
known as the 'Spanish problem'.
Disinflationary policies
All this changed dramatically in 1992, as the European economic crisis hit
the country. It can even be argued that German unification and the Danish
referendum have, between them, given Spain the disinflationary policies it
had allegedly long been seeking.
Interest differentials vis-a-vis the D-Mark soared after the result of the
Danish referendum. Differentials on three-month money vis-a-vis Germany rose
to a peak of 12 per cent in October 1992 and have remained between 4 1/2 and
7 per cent for most of the subsequent period. Moreover, the central rate of
the peseta was devalued in September and again in November, by a cumulative
total of 11 per cent.
Rising unemployment
This monetary and exchange rate turbulence coincided with, but also greatly
exacerbated, the recession. Industrial production fell by 1 per cent in
1992, while the decline in the year to the third quarter of 1992 was close
to 2 per cent. Some forecast a decline in gross domestic product between
1992 and 1993, which would be the worst economic performance since the
second world war. Unemployment has risen to over 3m, while the unemployment
rate is moving up once more towards the nigh on incredible - and, to a
certain extent, misleading - level of 20 per cent.
It is no wonder that the Spanish public at large and Spanish business, in
particular, have clamoured for far lower interest rates and even a departure
from the ERM. While the government has made a few concessions, it has
resisted the pressure, rightly so. Provided German interest rates fall soon
and the credibility of the ERM improves, Spain should be able to reduce
interest rates enough to allow a recovery appropriate to an economy whose
rate of inflation, though falling, remains above the best European levels.
Spain's fundamental problems are on the real side of the economy. In the
good years the government allowed excessive growth of public spending, while
also failing to liberalise what must be amongst the most distorted labour
markets in the world.
Now would not seem to be the best time to tackle the problems which the good
years have left behind. But it is the only time available. The crisis may
even have been necessary. The question is whether the Spanish will rise to
the challenge or give up the battle, now that it has at last been truly
joined.

What a marvellous idea by would-be sleuths at the Daily Mail to launch a

Unfortunately, the launchers need not have bothered. All they had to do was

To make matters even worse, the accident-prone stock exhange's brochures

Any recipient who got to the leaflet's page 6 before big boss Peter Rawlins
fell on his sword, would have been rewarded with some prescient words of

FT  12 MAR 93 / Observer: Earl's summitry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea of putting a British woman on top of Everest and raising Pounds 1m
for Sir Edmund Hillary's Himalayan Trust deserves all the support it can
get.
But seasoned City types might wince a little at the news that the assault is
being organised by Peter Earl, the 37-year-old takeover artist, who used to
specialise in thinking up bids that rarely worked. Remember his masterpiece
 -Benlox's infamous Pounds 2bn bid for Storehouse in 1987?
In the interval, not very much has been heard of Earl, who was on the dole
for a while and lists surviving recessions and geriatric rowing among his
professions. As one less than benevolent wag remarked yesterday, it will be
lucky if the expedition gets as far as Nepal, let alone to the first Everest
base camp.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One reason why BTR is a higher rated conglomerate than Hanson is that the
stock market believes BTR knows how to handle management succession. Unlike
Lord Hanson, Sir Owen Green knows when to step aside.
Even so, eyebrows will cock at 65-year-old Norman Ireland's elevation to the
BTR chair. He has been around almost as long as Green, which raises the
suspicion that in essence BTR is little different from from Hanson when it
comes down to the old guard clinging on to power.
It suggests that, while Alan Jackson is a jolly good chief executive, he may
not have the right sort of presentation skills to be chairman.
Perhaps Ireland should show he's his own man by promptly abolishing Green's
ban on the recruiting of non-executive directors from outside.

One thing the ambitious German executive never forgets: you are not a
Vorstand (main board director) until you are a Vorstand.
Agreed, nothing is assured even for the brightest and best. But is the lofty
Deutsche Bank not perhaps getting a touch careless with its aspiring talent?
It recently lost Gianemilio Osculati, 45, who quit as head of Banca
d'America e d'Italia, Deutsche's Italian subsidiary, after five years in
which the bank's profits had more than doubled. A head office job was
supposedly on offer, but not a Vorstand position, and he returned to his old
stable, McKinsey.
Now Frank Heintzeler, at 53 the executive vice-president in charge of
corporate finance activities, is also off. With his background - son of a
former chief legal officer of the BASF chemicals company - and his ability,
he seemed patently board material. But in 1990, the obvious route to the top
was blocked with the arrival of new Vorstand member Ronaldo Schmitz,
formerly finance director of BASF, put in charge of corporate finance.
Heintzeler leaves - on 'friendly terms' of course - to join the board of the
Baden-Wurttembergische Bank, a thriving Stuttgart institution. Next year he
becomes chief executive - but where is that in the pecking order compared
with a Vorstand seat at Deutsche?

FT  12 MAR 93 / Observer: Parkinson's predictors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A mystery has been left by the historian Professor Northcote Parkinson who
died aged 83 on Wednesday, 38 years after revealing his first law: 'Work
expands to fill the time available for its completion'.
It has since become at least as well known as any of the formulations of
economists. Nor - like his second law: 'Expenditure rises to meet income' -
does it seem any less true as a predictor of real events.
Hence the mystery. Why have managers not acted to eliminate the monstrously
wasteful effects the laws describe?
A possible reason is that both of them are products of human ambition. The
organisational manifestation of it that fascinated Parkinson is the pursuit
of power by empire-building, acquiring more and more subordinates who create
an expanding workload for each other at greater and greater cost.
Since that is the time-honoured way of rising in organisations, the laws'
sparse effect is understandable. People who've got to the top by
empire-building are unlikely to do away with it, especially when they still
need their empires to sustain them.
But if the lack of action disappointed Parkinson, it wouldn't have surprised
him. He knew his first law's workings had been described well before, as
follows:
'It is apparent from the accounts alone that a number of persons wishing to
batten on the estates of the Treasury have invented titles for themselves
such as controllers, secretaries or superintendents, whereby they procure no
advantage to the Treasury but swallow up the profits.'
The quotation is from a British Museum papyrus dated AD 288.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Italy's real revolution: Milan's magistrates are targeting
corrupt state-owned companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The revolution sweeping away Italy's postwar system of corrupt party rule
has begun in earnest.
The Milan magistrates investigating corruption have begun to disentangle the
intricate web of influence and control that politicians have exercised over
the main state-owned companies. The politicians' ability to manipulate these
companies has lain at the heart of a complex system of kick-backs and
pay-offs which has been the lifeblood of the main political parties - the
Christian Democrats and Socialists.
In four days this week Eni, the state oil concern which is the third-largest
company in Italy, has seen its management hierarchy decapitated. Mr Gabriele
Cagliari, the politically appointed president, is under arrest, as are the
heads of Eni's four principal subsidiaries. All have been accused of illicit
party financing and falsification of company books.
Milan magistrates are convinced Eni had a dual personality. One side was a
successful international oil group - a market leader - operating at the
frontiers of technology; the other was a fount of political patronage,
carefully controlled since the 1980s, predominantly by the Socialists.
Through such patronage in Eni and other state entities, politicians were
able to secure the funds which oiled the wheels of an increasingly greedy
political establishment. According to politicians who have already confessed
to corruption, such illicit funds amounted to at least L5,000bn (Pounds
2.18bn) a year.
Eni's split personality was yesterday symbolised by the differing fortunes
of the company's directors. A board meeting in Rome comprised just two
people - Mr Franco Bernabe, the technocrat chief executive who has assumed
full powers of the group, and a representative of the Italian Treasury, the
sole shareholder since last August. Meanwhile, in Milan's San Vittore jail,
the five imprisoned Eni group heads were answering charges of passing money
illicitly to their political masters.
Earlier in the week, Mr Cagliari, the first of the five to be imprisoned,
revealed the extent to which the old political system had degenerated. He
admitted to the magistrates that he had been involved, under duress, in the
payment of L4bn to a representative of the Socialist party to win a contract
on a power station being built by Enel, the state electricity authority.
Thus one state company had to pay an 'entry fee' to become a contractor for
another state concern.
Such practices explain why the country should have lagged so far behind the
rest of its EC partners in slimming down its large state sector and in
liberalising its economy. State companies provided jobs in areas where the
political parties could extend patronage, especially in the south; the same
companies also were in a position to back politicians' friends through
contracts.
Just as important, the state companies acted as financial sources which
complemented official party funding, which is limited by law to a total of
about L100bn for all of the political parties. That sum is wholly
insufficient to maintain an infrastructure of party faithful in the
bureaucracies, in the city and local councils, and in municipally owned
enterprises which include more than 200,000 employees. Not surprisingly, the
politicians wanted the system closed to prying eyes; and it suited the state
companies and most private ones to exclude foreign or domestic competition.
The first break in the circle arguably came from Brussels. The closer
scrutiny of competition policy by the EC Commission from the late 1980s
onwards, combined with moves towards the single European market, forced the
Italian public sector to become more transparent.
The second break came last August when the Amato government, faced with the
need to curb the uncontrolled rise in the public-sector deficit, opted for a
programme of large-scale privatisation. The initial step in this process was
the conversion of the four main state entities into publicly quoted
companies - Iri, the state holding company, Ina, the insurance institute,
Eni and Enel.
Privatisation has involved the removal of the existing politically appointed
boards and the concentration of management in professional hands, including
those who already worked within these companies. Thus in the case of Eni,
the company has been run for the past six months by Mr Bernabe, while Mr
Cagliari, installed as president in 1989 by Mr Bettino Craxi, the former
Socialist leader, has become a figurehead. The next stage in the programme
will be the appointment of a new board and moves to privatise subsidiaries.
But the politicians have been fighting a rearguard action to retain their
influence and slow the pace of privatisation. This is where the action of
the magistrates is so significant. Over recent months, and increasingly in
recent days, through arrests and confessions of state company executives and
private contractors, the full extent of the corruption network is being
exposed. These exposures have profoundly discredited the political
establishment and begun to dismantle a central pillar of the old system.
In the short term, the companies affected are likely to suffer in the
turmoil. But in the longer term, there should be an opportunity to put in
place a more transparent, slimmer state sector with a coherent privatisation
programme. It should also force the politicians to focus on legal means of
financing political parties - the issue at the centre of the anti-corruption
drive.

FT  12 MAR 93 / The plan that fell to earth: City confidence has been shaken
by the decision to abandon the Taurus project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City yesterday turned its back on a complicated and expensive stock
market settlement system in favour of a 'quick fix'. Hundreds of millions of
pounds of development costs, incurred by more than 150 financial
institutions in the City and many more listed companies, were formally
abandoned at 3pm, when news of the decision was announced.
The London Stock Exchange board's decision to drop its blighted Taurus
project has shaken the confidence of the City establishment. It was planned
by a wide range of institutions with interests in the securities industry to
be an electronic system of ownership and transfer of shareholdings.
City leaders had always stressed that it was an essential part of the
infrastructure needed to underpin London's stock market and re-inforce its
claim to being Europe's leading financial centre. In the event, it proved
only that the City establishment is incapable of overcoming the conflicting
self-interests of its members to put London as a financial centre first.
Mr Peter Rawlins, chief executive of the Stock Exchange, yesterday resigned,
to take responsibility for the failure of the project. But Sir Andrew Hugh
Smith, exchange chairman and chief executive for the moment, pinned the
blame largely on the fact that the early design for Taurus, developed by the
exchange, was rejected in 1989. Service registrars, who maintain share
registers for listed companies, voted down the idea because it could have
put them out of business. 'It wasn't surprising - after all, turkeys don't
vote for Christmas.'
Yesterday's move also raises serious questions about the future of the Stock
Exchange, which has been traumatised by its failure to complete Taurus.
Settlement is one of the exchange's core services, providing Pounds 47.5m of
its Pounds 194m of income last year.
Yesterday, it was effectively shunted aside by the Bank of England, which
stepped forward to take over responsibility for overhauling stock market
settlement in London. The exchange will continue to run the current system,
and may eventually have a role in whatever new arrangements the Bank
proposes - though Sir Andrew said he had urged the Bank to consider an
independent clearing house to run whatever system it comes up with. 'If
you're providing an industry-wide service, it should be done by an
industry-wide utility,' he said.
City-wide projects such as Taurus have been tried and failed before. They
have also relied on leadership from the Bank of England to pull them
through. In the early 1980s, the Bank and the Stock Exchange spent three
years trying to build an automated settlement system for the gilts market
before the Bank took over sole responsibility in 1985. The Central Gilts
Office is now an effective and widely admired part of the gilts market.
Also in the mid-1980s, the Bank was forced to step in when a City-wide
grouping of banks and discount houses failed to complete London Clear, a
project to automate settlement of transactions in the money markets. The
result was the Central Money Markets Office, which is also now run by the
Bank.
The Bank has no plans to take stock market settlement under its wing in this
way - but it believes it knows enough about clearing and settlement to take
a lead. Inevitably, the banking industry will be asked to play a stronger
role.
The Stock Exchange itself toyed with the idea of hiving off settlement to
the banking industry in the late 1980s. A committee under the chairmanship
of Sir Geoffrey Littler, a former Treasury official, was set up to plan an
independent clearing house. It was never formally closed, but ceased to meet
more than two years ago as the banks and the exchange lost interest.
For at least two reasons, the UK clearing banks are now likely to find
themselves thrust into a central role, whether or not they want it. First,
they play a central role in the securities markets.
Barclays, for instance, operates the UK's largest share registration
service, maintaining share registers for listed companies. It is a
custodian, providing administrative services to institutional shareholders,
and runs a retail stockbroking service through its branches. In Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, its securities subsidiary, it also owns one of the country's
largest institutional stockbrokers and an investment management company.
Second, the banks are likely to be forced into a central role because they
control the cash clearing system, Apacs. Cash and securities settlement will
need to be meshed together under whatever system is developed - and would
have been necessary under Taurus - to achieve 'delivery versus payment', the
automatic exchange of shares for cash after a stock market transaction has
taken place. This was one of the objectives laid down by the Group of 30,
the Washington-based think-tank whose initiative on the subject four years
ago helped to stimulate the modernisation of settlement systems in most
leading financial centres.
Also, banks will play an important role in any move away from the current
'account' arrangements on the stock market, under which all the share
transactions which take place over a two-week period are settled on a single
day, a week later. This will be replaced by rolling settlements - another
G30 initiative - under which bargains are settled a set number of days after
they take place.
A stock market based on such a short settlement cycle can only function when
control of shares and cash is centralised. Germany has achieved this partly
because the securities business has always been the domain of the banks.
The London Stock Exchange, meanwhile, has been left to pick up the pieces
from the unfortunate episode. Mr Rawlins had been brought in three years ago
 -with the Bank of England's backing - to give a new direction to a
venerable City institution which had lost its way.
Costs were rising at a time when profits in the securities industry were
being squeezed as never before. The exchange's technology base, pulled
together piecemeal over a number of years, needed replacing. The exchange
had lost one of its central roles - regulation - to the Securities and
Futures Authority, set up under the Financial Services Act of 1986. Mr
Rawlins was to bring it a new sense of purpose.
Three years later, costs have fallen but the technology base remains the
same. Of two grand technology plans, one - Taurus - has now been scrapped.
The other could now prove to be still-born.
This is the proposed new electronic trading system, viewed in some parts of
the City as a white elephant on a par with Taurus. Under review ever since
Mr Rawlins arrived at the exchange, it was meant to replace the system put
together hastily in the run-up to the Big Bang reforms of 1986.
The exchange has never publicly divulged its plans. However, brokers in the
City say that the proposed system is too complex and expensive. Eighteen
months ago, the estimated cost of building the system was Pounds 40m. Recent
indications of the cost given to securities houses put it at more than
Pounds 70m.
'Clearly, we will have to go over it with the board and assure them that
this is not another can of worms,' Sir Andrew said. 'I'm convinced we can do
that.'
In the stock market's current straitened circumstances, such projects look
too expensive. That was certainly the mood yesterday, with the new emphasis
on reducing the cost and time it takes to bring in a new settlement system.
The exchange's existing technology base, discounted by Mr Rawlins, may yet
be pressed into service for a little longer.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Not such a super Mario: The departure of Glaxo's chief
executive reflects a conflict over management style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The abrupt departure of Glaxo's chief executive yesterday is final
confirmation that one of the world's most successful drug companies has lost
its glamour. Even now, most other companies would regard Glaxo's position
with pure envy: double-digit earnings growth, a market value of Pounds 20bn
and Pounds 1.5bn of spare cash in the bank. But even Glaxo, it seems, is
groping for direction in a changing world.
The fall of Dr Ernest Mario can be seen on different levels. At the most
superficial, the picture emerges of a manager who had lost the confidence
not just of his immensely powerful chairman, Sir Paul Girolami, but of the
other executive directors.
Dr Mario, it is said, had an excessively hands-on style in dealing with
Glaxo's overseas territories. The older Glaxo tradition was to allow
regional directors considerable freedom, subject to stringent financial
targets. Dr Mario, a manager with an impressive grasp of detail, seems to
have practised a more interventionist style with his fellow directors.
He was also occasionally given to ill-judged public statements. Last March,
he told the press that Immigran, Glaxo's crucially important new migraine
drug, would be licensed imminently in the US; in fact it took until
December. Last month, he caused a stir by advocating a means test for
prescriptions in the UK: or, as the London Daily Express put it, 'Drop free
drugs says Pounds 1m boss'.
Perhaps there was a more fundamental issue. In the past, Sir Paul was
responsible for focusing Glaxo entirely on the manufacture of prescription
drugs. Dr Mario has been thought to lean towards a different option: that of
over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription medicines. Glaxo's ulcer treatment
Zantac, for instance, the world's best-selling drug, could be sold without
prescription as an antacid.
In recent weeks, there have been recurrent rumours of a giant rights issue
from Glaxo to buy a big OTC producer such as Warner Lambert of the US. Was
this the reason for the bust-up?
Not at all, Sir Paul said yesterday. 'Nobody, either Ernie (Mario) or the
board, has ever said that we're going to be an OTC company. Not at all.
We're looking for ways and means of marketing our research-based products in
the OTC market if there is a proper place for them. Ernie was more
open-minded on implementing that, but that's not a policy difference.
As for a rights issue, Sir Paul says, that is 'barmy'. What on earth would
Glaxo want a rights issue for? To buy something really big, is the obvious
answer. But that, says Sir Paul, has never crossed his mind. 'In the
process, you would change your policy. To buy, say, Procter and Gamble just
to enable us to sell our research-based products in the OTC market would be
absurd. And there was no conflict between us on that policy. Never, never,
never.'
The real policy issue, according to Sir Paul, goes deeper still. Glaxo needs
to change its organisational structure to cope with change. Dr Mario did not
fit in.
As to what these changes are, Sir Paul is reluctant to specify. Though he
does not say so, part of the problem clearly is that Glaxo has become too
big. The board structure has to be broadened and those at the top of the
company must be freed to deal with strategic issues at the operating level
around the world.
'Running all these markets is a big job. I did it myself when I was chief
executive 12 years ago, but it was possible then because we were much
smaller. Take India, which isn't very profitable. Who's got time to look
after that? It's a big company, with four or five thousand people in it. You
might say that's not important. It is absolutely vital for the future of
that company that it gets the support and the attention and the direction it
needs.
'The mistakes I'm trying to forecast are not mistakes in the market. We must
be making hundreds of them. It's mistakes in direction and development.
We're a lot better than we were, but even now there are major companies in
the group which are not major profit earners, and are not getting the
attention they deserve.'
The new structure, says Sir Paul, involves him being less involved in the
hands-on running of the company than before. But one individual, the former
research director Dr Richard Sykes, is to assume extraordinary powers. He is
the new chief executive and deputy chairman, while retaining responsibility
for a research department which last year spent Pounds 595m.
But the point, says Sir Paul, is that the running of the operations has been
delegated to another director, Dr Franz Humer. Not entirely, though: the US,
much the largest of Glaxo's markets, will still report to Dr Sykes.
There is also the perplexing question of succession. Sir Paul is to retire
in two and a half years, on reaching 70. Dr Mario was widely accepted as the
heir apparent. But talk about personal succession, says Sir Paul, is crazy.
'You can do that with prime ministers, you can do it with bureaucratic
institutions, you might even do it with newspapers. Not with a company like
ours.'
It is 'extremely unlikely', he says, that Dr Mario would have succeeded him.
So does the change in board structure mean the succession is now more open?
Not necessarily: Dr Sykes, says Sir Paul, must have first claim, though
there are three or four other candidates.
In the end, it appears, Dr Mario had to go because he was not the right man
for the new structure. 'The issue is his fitness, in the next 10 years, to
run an organisation in the way we intend. I don't think there's much beyond
that. Even if it had been true that we had disagreed over the OTC question,
it's incredible that it would have been a leaving issue. Eventually I would
just have said to him: 'Where does the buck stop? And in two and a half
years, with a bit of luck you can do what you like.'
'But these issues are much deeper and more general than that. At that level,
you're talking about a very important job: so important that, unfortunately,
it's black and white. You can't say: 'Look Ernie, we're not going to get on,
but you had a wonderful job at Glaxo Inc - go back.' You just can't do it.'
In the end, the explanation is not wholly satisfactory. But Glaxo is a
deeply secretive company, which has been forced by yesterday's drama to lift
a corner of the veil. Whatever really lies behind it, the company will never
project quite the same image again.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Corn Laws all over again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives may yet fall apart over Europe, as they did in 1846 over
the repeal of the Corn Laws, and again in 1904-05 over tariff reform. The
glue that is keeping them at least nominally together is the tribal memory
of what happened after those celebrated schisms. Following the election of
1857 the Tories became the natural party of opposition to the Liberals. At
the 1906 general election, following the second great split, a Conservative
majority of 135 was lost. It was replaced by a Liberal majority of 129.
Heaven knows how long the Tories would have stayed in their early
20th-century wilderness, had they not been rescued by Asquith's wartime
coalition in 1915.
The same awful warning is evident from the history of Britain's other great
national parties. The Liberals split in 1886 over Gladstone's proposals for
Irish home rule. Liberal unionists joined the Conservatives, who governed
for all but three of the subsequent 20 years. Nearly a century later Labour
right-wingers, appalled by left-wing extremism and an outbreak of parochial
anti-Europeanism, walked out to found the Social Democrats, a short-lived
party of the centre. The leading Labour proponent of trade-union domination
and egalitarian socialism was Mr Tony Benn, now fading into the venerability
that the House of Commons bestows upon its long-stayers. Bennfoolery cost
Labour four general elections in a row. The continuing aftershock may yet
cost it a fifth.
Today the question facing Conservatives is how far the foolery encouraged by
Lady Thatcher and Lord Tebbit will go. Banished to the House of Lords, their
ghosts still haunt the Commons, where a band of hardline Europhobes
contrives with devilish skill to gum up the proceedings. In the process,
they are stripping the remaining tatters of authority from the increasingly
ragged figure of the prime minister. If they manage to destroy the bill to
ratify the Maastricht treaty, he will probably feel obliged to resign.
Was it a case of 'no bill, no John Major?', I asked a colleague of his on
Monday. It was more 'no bill, no government', came the reply. But there
would be a Conservative replacement. Whatever happened, Labour would not get
a general election out of the Tories' present discomfiture. Another
minister, himself a Eurosceptic, remarked that, while he thought the bill
would pull through, he had to say that it looked remarkably sick.
Mr Major knows what such musings imply. It is natural that he should regard
the maintenance of party unity as his principal task. He believes he has
done well in this endeavour, given the tensions that existed when he came to
office in November 1990. It would not be surprising if at yesterday's
cabinet meeting he had asked his ministers to speak out in favour of the
Maastricht bill, but to choose their words with care. He does not want
vituperative attacks on the Europhobes. Unity on non-Maastricht matters will
have to be restored if the government is to gain parliamentary acceptance
for various difficult measures that lie ahead, perhaps on the Budget and
most certainly on the new plans for coal. It would not do to destroy the
chances of reuniting the Tories on such matters by initiating a war of harsh
words on Europe now.
Seen from Downing Street, the anti-Maastricht rebellion is containable. The
bill is about halfway through the Commons. The dangers ahead can be divided
into three categories. First, the thundering from the all-party flotilla of
procedural obstructionists is being countered by an attempt to shame Labour
and the Liberals into restraining themselves. They do, after all, profess to
favour the Maastricht treaty. Whatever the opposition contrives, government
whips will continue to score tactical gains as opportunities arise. Second,
various minor amendments, none of which threaten ratification, have to be
talked through. Mr Major is prepared to take the punishment inherent in
losing some or all of the votes on these.
That leaves the third area of danger, a list of potentially destructive
amendments, such as a fresh attempt to incorporate the social chapter. The
latter is essentially a statement of good intent on employment and social
policies, but it has become a symbol for all sides in the parliamentary
battle. If the opposition finds a way of drafting a clause that nullifies
Britain's opt-out, and if it is accepted for debate and wins, the government
will regard the bill as sunk. It may be bravado, but the message from senior
members of the cabinet is that Labour cannot have both the bill and the
social chapter.
We must not take this line of argument too far. A sense that there may be a
schism is not the same thing as certain knowledge that the government is
doomed. The comforting thought with which Mr Major and his colleagues soothe
themselves to sleep at night goes like this: the bill will get through, if
not in the summer then in the autumn. The economy will by then have shown
tangible signs of recovery. People will begin to realise that the time spent
on the Maastricht struggle did not prevent the administration from
completing a large quantity of other business. Confidence will begin to
return. Next year will be better and 1995 will be really good. An election
in, say, April 1996 is therefore winnable, perhaps with an increased
Conservative majority.
Throughout the troubles of the past six months this bedtime story has seemed
to be the most plausible account of what is likely to happen. It still is -
just. It has, however, become prudent to question it, if only in response to
the bitterness with which Conservatives are now attacking one another. They
are in danger of tearing their party to pieces, in spite of the prime
minister's desire for less divisive discourse.
The government is therefore in the invidious position of relying upon Labour
and Liberal Democrat votes, or abstentions, to get its main piece of
business through. Perhaps the principled Europeanism of the leaders of those
parties will save the bill, and the treaty. The alternative may be a huge
political bust-up, with an outside chance of smashing the Conservatives. The
minimum benefit to the opposition could be the defenestration of half the
present cabinet. Europhile Labour and Liberal MPs might not let their
leaders get away with it. Yet it must be the mother of all political
temptations.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Letter: UK industry could compete if regulatory regime
favourable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EWAN MACPHERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('The pleas for manufacturing', March 8) posed the question
of why Japanese industrialists can make internationally competitive products
in the UK when their British equivalents find it so difficult.
The answer is that in most of the cases which attract attention, the
Japanese have been able to set up on greenfield sites: they can then install
state of the art equipment at the outset and train the labour force to their
requirements. In addition, the financing of the projects has often been made
attractive by UK government incentives, and their own cost of finance was
extraordinarily low in the 1980s.
Given the chance of a greenfield operation for a project, I believe the
British industrialist can do just as well as the Japanese. Where the Brit is
at a disadvantage, all too often, is when he is trying to modernise an
existing facility, retrain an existing labour force, deal with a major
redundancy at the same time, and manage his earnings statement, all in
volatile economic conditions where interest rates are increasing just at the
time when demand is falling. In such circumstances, it becomes managerially
easier and financially less risky to run down the old plant and become a
distributor for a product made elsewhere.
If the government wishes British industrialists to remain internationally
competitive, it should provide at least a level playing field to encourage
them to stay as manufacturers in the UK.
This means ensuring that the regulatory regime is in step with Britain's
competitors (not ahead of them because of the cost implications) and some
help with financing might also be necessary.
In times past it was possible at reasonable cost to raise long-term,
fixed-interest rate finance for long-term projects so that the financing
cost became a matter of certainty. Today, long-term, fixed-interest rate
finance is relatively scarce and appears very expensive compared to
short-term finance. The government might usefully devise a scheme to
encourage manufacturing by providing a mechanism to fix the finance cost of
plant modernisation and capacity expansion projects, just as it has in the
past provided fixed rate finance through the Export Credit Guarantee
Department and for ships.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Letter: World Bank advocates openness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALEXANDER SHAKOW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Holman raises a complex and difficult issue in his opinion on
the World Bank and access to economic information in Africa ('World Bank's
worst-kept secrets', March 2).
In general, we agree with his call for as much openness as possible. As he
acknowledges, the bank already makes available a great deal of economic
information on Africa and other developing regions. However, he would like
us to go further and publish confidential economic analysis of individual
countries, even when the government opposes publication. It should be
understood that while the bank encourages the release of pertinent country
economic information and analysis, we cannot impose our wishes upon
sovereign governments.
But it is wrong to assume - simply because much of the economic policy
dialogue takes place out of the public eye - that, therefore, the bank's
relationships with some governments are 'unhealthy'. As many governments
would testify, the bank is very forthright in offering its candid economic
analysis - and making its financial support contingent on reforms being
implemented to address identified problems.
It should also be noted that the bank has been, and continues to be, a
strong advocate of greater openness in borrowing member countries because it
believes these principles are directly linked to sustainable development.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Letter: Conservative party not immune to principles of
democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERIC CHALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his letter (March 5) Sir Norman Fowler drew a perfectly correct
distinction between his constitutional position within the Conservative
party and that of the constituency associations. Because that distinction is
rarely pointed out and because the colloquial title 'party chairman' is used
as frequently by Sir Norman as his predecessors, it is hardly surprising
that many think he has a wider authority.
However, while he correctly distances himself from the party's membership in
one paragraph, he purports to speak on their behalf in the next. In praising
Sir Basil Feldman's report dealing with party members' affairs Sir Norman
was misinformed, because this report has never even been discussed by the
party's executive committee, let alone 'passed' as he suggests.
The true view of the membership may be deduced from the fact that key
changes proposed in the Feldman report failed to win the necessary support
at Harrogate on March 5.
The original Financial Times report which provoked Sir Norman's letter
referred to the blocking of a special meeting requisition by 50 constituency
associations co-ordinated by the party reform steering committee. Sir Norman
is quite right to say that we are not opposed to many of the steps he has
taken to reform the management of Central Office, but he sidesteps what is
our concern. Not one single member of the new board of management will be
accountable to the constituency associations.
We believe that a majority of them should be, in order to make the board
itself democratically accountable to the membership. Sir Norman argues
instead for a restricted form of representation that leaves him with total
control and the constituencies with no say.
This lack of democratic accountability is highlighted by Sir Norman's
intention declared at Harrogate but not in his letter - to make the whole
party accountable to his board. This is particularly perverse, of course,
considering the very limited constitutional authority enjoyed by Sir Norman,
as he so clearly described at the start of his letter.
If the Conservative party were a company and this correspondence were to
appear on your City pages, it would hardly seem credible. If the
Conservative party were a trade union, it would long ago have been dragged
before the courts for its abuse of membership rights. The fact that it is
the principal political party of this country should not make it immune to
the principles of good governance and democracy.

From Mr Harry Melrose.
Sir, As the 24th third party assessment body accredited by NACCB, and the
only one established in Scotland, we appreciate the visibility given by
Charles Batchelor.
Public ignorance of the process of accredited certification is indeed the
root cause of the opportunity openings for cowboys. Many believe that the
British Standards Institution controls all assessment and certification
activities including the NACCB, and no difference is perceived between BSI
and its subsidiary, BSI Quality Assurance, which operates as one of the 'two
dozen' certification bodies.
The Association of British Certification Bodies was formed in 1992 and
complaints regarding assessment and certification activities should be
addressed to the secretary at 2 Park Street, London W1A 2BS.

<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Batchelor ('Need a quality certificate? Ask Tom, Dick or
Harry', March 8) rightly expresses a loophole in quality management system
accreditation which, if the long term success of BS 5750 is to be assured,
the government must move to seal.
The growth in National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies to 24
has led to much needed competition in the market. The downside has been the
increase of cowboy companies seeking to profit from the ignorance of the
market. These companies are telling clients that they will sell them
consultancy and then give them BS 5750.
The government must act now to prevent non-NACCB bodies awarding BS 5750.
Only this will secure the future of one of the success stories of the
Department of Trade and Industry Enterprise Initiative.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Arts: 'Divine Words' on degradation - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you can take Lorca's The House of Bernarda Alba without finding it
unbearably harrowing, you might move on to Divine Words by Ramon Del
Valle-Inclan which, I believe, is having its first English language
performance in London.
Valle-Inclan was born a generation before Lorca, but died in the same year -
1936. His writing life began conventionally enough. He was a journalist in
Mexico, a literary figure in Madrid, then after the first world war reacted
against classicism and wrote about poverty in his native Galicia.
'Poverty' is putting it politely. Divine Words, written in 1920, is more
about degradation, superstition and all forms of primitivism than about the
absence of sustenance. The one thing that the people never lack completely
is money - and brandy. One of the reasons for seeing the play is to
understand why there was a Spanish civil war. The priests are as ignorant as
the laity. The police are feared, but are neither intelligent nor competent.
Here is a society wholly cut off from civilising influences.
Another reason for seeing Divine Words is that this production by the Loose
Change Company, directed by Tessa Schneideman, is supremely well done.
Altogether 14 people are employed, including three musicians. Between them
they tell you as much about a certain view of Galicia as you need to know.
If you want to see a Spanish hydro-cephalic dwarf, footless and speechless,
towed around the countryside in a barrow as his pushers hope to earn a few
pesetas, here he is. The dwarf eventually dies of an epileptic fit, having
consumed too much brandy. He is given the drink because in order to get it,
he is prepared to croak like a frog.
This is perhaps the most grotesque scene in a gruesome play, but there are
others which run it close, like the near communal rape of the priest's
woman. Hysteria is never far below the surface, though surprisingly Divine
Words seems to end on a note of christian forgiveness: 'Let he is who is
without sin cast the first stone.' The priest's woman is thus saved from
being stoned to death.
I would not pretend that it is a good, rather than an interesting, play,
largely because for enjoyment you have to rely on intellectual curiosity and
the strength of the performances. There is not much relief. But this is the
value of the fringe theatre: as a collector's item it should be seen. There
is some outstanding playing by Cleo Sylvestre as an almost toothless,
gossipy but not entirely humourless hag, though also by the entire cast. Ms
Schneideman has made the cast speak with southern Irish accents. I am not
sure that is necessary.

It looks like an excellent day for sending off a cheque to your favourite
charity then going out and supporting the British economy by having a decent
dinner, or entertaining yourself and supporting the arts by going to the
theatre ..or better still, going to the theatre and then going on to dinner.
If you stay in to watch television you will find BBC1 monopolised by Total
Relief, one of those charity marathons which somehow manage to turn you
against even people that you previously liked and admired, and the other
three channels offering lacklustre schedules in which the occasional
highlight is something desperately familiar. Those confined to bed with flu
will just have to watch The Bill (8.00 ITV) a police series which sustains a
remarkably high standard; Cheers, the wise-cracking series about the
regulars in an American bar, which is equally reliable (9.30 C4); and Whose
Line Is It Anyway (10.30 C4) which is less consistent but almost always
produces a couple of hilarious moments . Best programme of the evening will
almost certainly be the repeat of Episode 8 in Edgar Reitz's serial Heimat
(11.20 BBC2).

FT  12 MAR 93 / Arts: Corea at the keyboards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something disingenuous about the way Chick Corea makes a point of
mentioning the make of the piano. Sure, it is a very nice piano, and with
Corea at the controls it plays just about everything skilfully from a rhumba
to a prelude, via Monk and Ellington.
The acoustic soloist is but one of Corea's powerful personae. In addition to
his fierce Elektric fusion band which features Nasa style technology among
the virtuosi, Corea leads acoustic ensembles and performs classical
concertos. He is a complete pianist and alone at the grand on this tour he
takes the opportunity to show he really can do it all, no problem.
As an improvisor Corea is perfectly centred and he tackles his base
material. Limbering up with 'Armando's Rhumba' at the Festival Hall on
Monday, the American quickly kneaded the keyboard into a latin workout
before moving on to 'Sophisticated Lady' and the uneasy listening of a
tightly phrased 'With A Song In My Heart'. 'Blue Monk' was condensed into a
pleasantly wobbling boogie woogie while Bud Powell's favourite tune 'How
Deep Is The Ocean' sparkled appealingly. Monk reared his head again as Corea
worked up a lavishly embroidered ''Round Midnight'.
It is ironic that Corea should cite Monk and Powell in his solo work. For
all his technical brilliance and skill as a writer, Corea remains at the
opposite end of the intensity scale to these two. Indeed, it is more
stimulating to hear Corea tinkering under the lid of the piano which travels
everywhere with him; it gives him the air of a rather eccentric and yet
emotionally detached performer.
Perhaps with the break up of the Elektric and Akoustic bands Corea is left
wondering what to tackle next. Whichever, the 'messing around with a
prelude' and the snippets of 'Children's Songs' which closed the short set
were no more than engaging. It could be time for Corea to get a new piano.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Arts: Othello - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This sterling Othello ushers in Bill Alexander's new regime as artistic
director of the Birmingham Rep. I welcome the way it draws attention to
Othello and its players (rather than directorial concepts); the way it
evades (on the whole) the awkwardly echoing Rep acoustics; and the way it
uses the depth and breadth of the Rep stage to great effect. All fine omens.
Alexander and his designer, Kit Surrey, make the most of the sheer size of
this stage. Surrey has paved the floor in huge black tiles that spread right
forward to meet the auditorium's front row, across into the sides (the wings
are invisible) and way back to the rear - where a rear wall, also in black
stone, may sometimes be dimly discerned. Simple properties - a curtain, a
bed, a hanging cross, a council table  - help to define particular scenes.
Or, as when people rush across the stage with flaming torches looking for
Desdemona in Venice, you sense the sweep of an entire city.
Jeffery Kissoon is a statuesque, smouldering Othello who never has to fake
to create the character's heroic stature. He paints his every entrance in a
different mood - calmly assured before the Venetian council, overwhelmed by
emotion on arrival in Cyprus, light and imperturbable in his first duo with
Iago - and then, in later scenes, possessed, wracked and, finally, bleakly
fixated. You see the changeability of the man; and you see, above all in
body language, how this mighty man becomes passive to jealousy - his legs
shaking as he sits in a form of excitement that is almost sexual.
His voice can be huge, and hugely emotional. His accent is Caribbean. I
dislike his way of barking climaxes, of letting minor syllables (even minor
lines) drop away without proper vocal support, and of chopping up single
clauses into mini-phrases. ('Most. Humbly. Therefore.') Considering his
extensive experience in Shakespeare, he should know more about
verse-speaking. But, though he runs quite a gamut here, he seldom displays
any relish for actorly virtuosity; and he aims constantly for the role's
human truth.
As Iago, Hilton McRae allows himself a few flashes of technical display  -
notably, an oh-so-slow ascent from the floor after Othello has wounded him
and then a sinisterly croaking delivery of 'I bleed, sir; but not kill'd'
Shame. In general, he makes Iago marvellously plausible in the eyes of all.
(And when he leaves pauses in a line - 'her body's . . . lust' - he at least
shows that the words form a single phrase.) Whereas Kissoon is a
bass-baritone and is all volume and colour, McRae is a light baritone-tenor,
accurate and toneless. Who this Othello is, you know; who this Iago is,
never.
Alex Kingston makes Desdemona into an earnest, winsome, unappealing bore.
You can see how she is trying to avoid any pastel-pretty feebleness, but you
cannot really see why Othello should have been spellbound by her in the
first place. She ties her permed mane into a different knot for each scene,
but always looks a mess; she walks leadenly; and she talks as if her
marriage to Othello was something that happened during the practical year of
her honours degree in sociology. She is completely believable, even intense
 -but in no way heartcatching.
Katy Behean's Emilia is a model of natural, detailed playing. Some of the
other roles (Cassio, Lodovico, Gratiano) are given with less character than
undergrad charm and clarity. But everything has energy and tension; Othello
itself never palls. In addition to the cast of 12, Alexander has hired 19
supernumeraries, who swell the big public scenes with splendid visual
impact. I love the way Iago seems to throw a stone over the audience and
break Brabantio's window behind us. Sound-effects, lighting, are all of a
high order.
At the Birmingham Rep until April 10

FT  12 MAR 93 / Arts: Composers in Cambridge - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week the BBC Philharmonic has forsaken its home on Manchester to take
up residence in Cambridgeshire. With assistance from the Eastern Orchestral
Board and Cambridgeshire County Council, the orchestra is visiting schools
and hospitals throughout the county to give workshops and informal concerts,
as well as presenting a series of public concerts in Cambridge itself. The
first of those on Tuesday in the Concert Hall of the University Music School
had a local flavour; Matthias Bamert conducted a programme of works by four
university composers - the professor of music, Alexander Goehr, his
departmental colleagues Hugh Wood and Robin Holloway, and the 21-year-old
Thomas Ades, who was an undergraduate at King's College until last June.
Such a concert would have been highly unlikely two decades ago; prospective
composers who sought a university education in the late 1960s were much more
likely to opt for Birmingham, York or Sussex rather than Oxbridge, where
contemporary music was a clandestine activity, to be indulged outside the
academic curriculum. But since Goehr's appointment to the Cambridge chair in
1976, the whole outlook of the department has changed radically; by
attracting composers of the calibre of Wood and Holloway to lecture there,
the position of the university in British musical life has been immeasurably
enhanced. Which need not imply that Goehr has gone out to create a
'Cambridge school' after his own image, following strict doctrinaire lines,
far from it; as this concert demonstrated, he and Wood may remain good
Schoenbergians at heart, but Holloway as always is very much his own
infuriatingly unclassifiable man, while the sample of Ades's music suggested
another lively and eclectic spirit.
Ades's 12-minute Chamber Symphony, written two years ago, was certainly hard
to pin down. It compresses four movements into one following the Schoenberg
model, but then the parallels fail; the work propels itself on a series of
jazz rhythms and riffs, with quickfire changes of perspective, tempo and
tone colour. The piano used is a prepared one, an accordion insinuates
itself towards the end; there are fugitive quotations (including Beethoven's
Lebewohl motif) hinting at an undisclosed programme. Not everything cohered,
but Bamert's performance seemed rather strait-laced and a conductor more
willing to go with the rhythms and loosen up the phrasing might well bring
it into sharper focus.
*****
The remainder of the programme was more or less familiar. Tasmin Little was
the marvellously eloquent soloist in Wood's very fine Violin Concerto from
1972, while Goehr's Deux Etudes, sumptuous explorations of orchestral
sonority and texture from 1981 remained to my ears at least as baffling and
uncommunicative as ever. Holloway's Diptych, a pair of detachable movements
from his famously garrulous 1974 symphonic poem Domination of Black ended
the concert in a splendidly larger-than-life way, producing a density of
sound (reinforced with Wagner tubas) that was overwhelming in such a
relatively confined space.
On Wednesday in the Festival Hall Peter Maxwell Davies conducted the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra in his own Worldes Blis, the massive orchestral study
from 1969 which created a minor furore at its premiere at the Proms that
year, and which now may be seen as the climax of the first phase of Davies's
development. It is still a daunting challenge for the orchestra as much as
audience, but wears wonderfully well; not a note is wasted in its 40-minute
span, and the ineffably slow tread of much of its development is compelling
to follow.
If the orchestration now seems rather utilitarian, especially against the
luminous colours of Davies's later Orkney-inspired scores, the musical
argument, so taut and uncompromising (and in the light of his subsequent
development so discriminating) remains thrilling. The recording that Davies
and the RPO are about make for Collins Classics is eagerly awaited.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Arts: Hakewill's Grand Tour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Napoleon's fate was finally sealed in the summer of 1815, and the British
could once again descend on Italy. One travelling companion sure to be in
demand was an up-to-date guidebook. In the spring of 1816, the enterprising
James Hakewill, architect, set sail from Dover with his wife. He had already
established a reputation as an author and artist with his History of Windsor
and its Neighbourhood, which capitalised on George III's extensive
improvements to the castle, and he would go on to publish A Picturesque Tour
of Jamaica and the even less likely Abattoirs of Paris.
The fruits of his year-long travels on the continent were some 300 careful
topographical drawings. In A Picturesque Tour of Italy, published in parts
by John Murray between 1818 and 1820, Hakewill's aim was to 'bring together
correct portraits of those places which attract the notice of the traveller
in Italy', taking in 'picturesque' prospects, notable architecture and sites
rich in historical interest. It also provided interior views of public
sculpture and picture galleries.
Hakewill, unlike his publisher, had great ambitions for his project. On his
return he commissioned the likes of Turner, Copley Fielding and John Varley
to make watercolours for the engravers from his pencil drawings. Murray
would have none of the extra expense, and refused all the watercolours bar
Turner's. In the end, only 36 out of the proposed 60 engraved views were
used, and the remainder of the plates comprised the outline engravings after
Hakewill's museum interiors. The publication proved a financial flop, and
Murray was obliged to sell the Turners in order to recoup some of his
losses.
It has taken 175 years for all of Hakewill's Italian drawings to make it
into print. Thanks to the Cartieri Miliani-Fabriano and the Instituto
Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato, the entire group has been fully catalogued
and published with a text in English and Italian; and Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox
has a selection of some 70 sheets on display in London. (Twilight of the
Grand Tour, by Tony Cubberley and Luke Herrmann, is available from The
British School at Rome, 31-34 Gordon Square, London WC1H 0PY, Pounds 60, or
from Hazlitt's during the show in return for a donation of Pounds 25 or more
to the School's development appeal.) Hakewill now offers his public an
unique document of post-Napoleonic Italy - and of the last years of the
Grand Tour.
The Grand Tour, which would take in at least France and the Alps as well as
the Classical South, had been deemed an essential part of a gentleman's
education since the early 18th century. Hakewill's Tour catered for the
educated and high-minded. It is tempting to see its most innovative
contribution, the outline drawings of the sculpture galleries of the Vatican
and the Capitol, as a response to the Antique statuary excavated in
increasing numbers in the environs of Rome and Naples. The belief of the
painter, archaeologist and dealer Gavin Hamilton that 'the most valuable
acquisition a man of refined taste can make is a piece of fine Greek
sculpture' still held true in the early 19th century. What had changed, as
Hakewill presumably was only too aware, was that the travellers who came to
genuflect at the feet of the Laocoon or the Apollo Belvedere were no longer
predominantly those who could afford to acquire Greek and Roman antiquities.
The age of middle-class travel had dawned.
If Hakewill's drawings at time seem mechanical and formulaic, it ought to be
remembered that these are first and foremost working drawings, intended to
provide as much information as possible to the watercolourist and engraver.
Not infrequently, however, they achieve their own kind of careful poetry,
and a penetrating, neo-Classical clarity reminiscent of Eckersberg's views
of Rome.
*****
A poetical view of the grey-green garden of the Villa Pamphili in Rome at
dusk by the incomparable John Robert Cozens; Turner's perfunctory evocation
of a double rainbow over the Falls of the Rhine at Schaffhausen; and
Callow's hoary 'Bay of Naples - Early Morning' present markedly different
interpretations of the hallowed sites of the tourist itinerary, and are
among the highlights of Agnew's 120th annual watercolour exhibition.
This year's selection embraces artists from Gainsborough to Augustus John.
Recent rediscoveries include a Hoppner pencil and red chalk portrait of
exceptional delicacy, and a small Turner sketch in which the sea, under a
blood-red sunset, almost boils with shoals of mackerel driven to the shore.
The high point of the 1993 show, however, is the wall of nine Samuel
Palmers. A previously unrecorded watercolour over pencil, 'Ploughing with
Oxen, with a Village in the Distance', has been convincingly attributed to
Palmer's visionary Shoreham period.

the barcode on each item while an in-built weighing system checks the weight
of the product. Lasers check the shape of the item to verify its identity.
Any discrepancy and the belt reverses direction, sending the shopping

FT  12 MAR 93 / Technology: A freer flow of goods - How trucks of the future
could transform freight delivery on Europe's congested roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some shoppers travel across town in search of a favourite food item, but
this is nothing compared with the distances the goods have to travel to
reach the shelves. It is estimated the contents of the average weekend
shopper's supermarket trolley have already covered 4,000km by truck or van.
With freight volumes set to soar on Europe's already congested roads - the
EC forecasts that the volume of freight on EC roads will reach 16.5bn tonnes
by 2010, nearly double the 1989 level - truck makers are pushing for heavier
trucks to be allowed on long-distance routes.
They argue that a rise to vehicles of 48 tonnes or more from the 40 tonnes
permitted at present would mean fewer journeys and thus a smaller number of
trucks.
Manufacturers have made considerable progress in increasing vehicles'
carrying capacity through new designs and the use of lighter materials. But
the problem goes beyond advances in truck design and raises questions about
the way in which freight transport is organised on Europe's increasingly
congested roads. For coming decades, some far-sighted executives argue that
new types of truck must be developed to cut down on congestion and exhaust
emissions.
Prominent among them is Cor Baan, whose main energies in recent weeks have
been devoted to helping stave off financial collapse, since he is chairman
of Daf trucks. He also heads the new Daf company created with Dutch and
Belgian backing.
Baan has been thinking along lines which lead a long way from Daf's present
troubles. In his view, the trucks of the future would have hybrid
diesel-electric engines and all-wheel steering.
They would be quiet and flexible enough to deliver standardised 'modules' of
all types of goods to city stores and other urban businesses through the
night, using automated reception and storage systems which would require no
manning. These would complement larger trucks transporting goods across the
EC.
Urban goods movement is the area where the biggest problems occur due to
congestion, smog and excessive noise, stresses Baan, who gave his views at a
recent commercial vehicle symposium organised in Brussels by FEBIAC,
Belgium's motor industry trade association.
'With road transport organised as it is at present, can you imagine a
further growth of tens of per cent in transport volumes in and around cities
such as Paris, Frankfurt or London,' he asks.
In the small Dutch city of Maastricht, for example, with 116,000
inhabitants, some 5,200 consignments are delivered daily, of which more than
70 per cent take up less than one cubic metre. About 3,800 journeys are
made, totalling 38,000km. Baan contends that as companies continue to cut
the volume of stocks, deliveries will increase as consignments become
smaller, requiring a 'totally new' approach to distribution. However, while
urban centres cannot cope properly with this volume during the day, their
streets are largely empty at night.
Using this slack time could not only greatly increase distribution
efficiency, but reduce vehicle exhaust emission problems. Emissions of
pollutants like oxides of nitrogen are 65 per cent less in free-flowing
traffic than when the roads are congested.
In Baan's vision of a distribution system of the future, goods would be
brought together at distribution centres on the outskirts of cities and
packaged into consignments for individual recipients, thus eliminating many
duplicated journeys. Intrinsic to the concept is a goods 'module' which
would have to conform to an EC-wide specification on durability, easy
handling and dimensions.
Dutch universities have already researched such a module, based on two
International Standards Organisation pallets. Their use would open the way
to a new type of standardised goods reception system in shops or shopping
centres. These would not require overnight manning. Roller-tracked chutes
would accept new containers and return old ones, with 'paper work' carried
out electronically between truck and shop computer.
It is the clear unacceptability of noise in such an operation which has
prompted the suggestion of diesel-electric hybrid trucks, capable of using
battery-only operation in town. Apart from being near-silent, such trucks
would have to be highly manoeuvrable, hence the idea for all-wheel steering.
The loading/unloading system would also have to be capable of operating
vertically and horizontally.
Despite the concept's radical nature, Baan believes it is fully realisable
in the 21st century. 'It may look very futuristic but in fact all the
techniques used in it are already available.'
Until such ideas are translated into practice, however, manufacturers'
efforts will continue to be concentrated on maximising the carrying capacity
of trucks. These have led to vehicles with very low chassis, and even
low-profile tyres, to raise carrying space within overall EC length and
height restrictions.
But this only increases the volume of goods which can be carried. So
manufacturers have shown equal adroitness in reducing unladen vehicle weight
 -thus increasing the weight of goods which can be carried per vehicle -
through the use of lighter materials and more efficient design.
Leif Ostling, general manager of Scania, the Swedish group, says the unladen
weight of one of its heavy trucks has been cut from 10 tonnes to nine tonnes
over the past two decades and that scope still exists to save weight. Yet
while today's vehicles undoubtedly can and will be improved, it is
innovations like that proposed by Baan that will be closely studied for
solutions to future traffic problems.

<TEXT>
Smile warmly, adopt a regal pose and lash on the lipstick. This is the
somewhat tongue-in-cheek advice given by BT to purchasers of its latest
piece of consumer wizardry, the videophone.
The Relate 2000 videophone, with a three-inch colour screen, sends pictures
across ordinary telephone lines. Calls are charged at the usual rate.
The disadvantages are that the picture becomes distinctly blurry as the
caller moves around and the voice is delayed, as with some calls sent via
satellite.
These drawbacks are caused because of the compression needed to send all the
information in a colour picture along a telephone line. A television picture
is transmitted at 140m bits of information per second, whereas the
videophone sends just 14,400 bits - one ten thousandth of the television
picture.
A further drawback is that there is no international standard for
videophones that work on the ordinary network, so not all can communicate.
Two competing technologies have emerged, the GEC Marconi one, known as
M-VTS, and one from AT&amp;T in the US. M-VTS has been adopted by the telephone
companies in Singapore and Hong Kong as well as by BT. In Japan the trading
company Mitsui is selling the GEC Marconi phone. And in the US, MCI has also
teamed up with GEC Marconi in competition with AT&amp;T, which launched its
videophone last year.
BT is targeting its videophone squarely at the consumer. It will be sold
through its shops and the Dixons group from April, although first sales will
be at next week's Ideal Home Exhibition in London.
The low price of the new videophone - Pounds 399 for a single unit and
Pounds 749 for two - has caused some consternation. Consumer marketing
specialist Amstrad had planned to launch a videophone, similarly made by GEC
Marconi, but has been forced to delay plans while it rethinks manufacturing
costs.

FT  12 MAR 93 / The Property Market: Out of town but much in mind - Approval
of a new shopping centre for Manchester has refueled an old debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the fiercest planning debates of the past decade was rekindled last
week when the government gave the go-ahead for Manchester's Trafford Centre,
one of the largest out-of-town shopping centres in the UK.
Its supporters, in one corner, were the developers who claimed the Pounds
200m scheme would bolster Manchester's regeneration and its attempt to
attract the Olympic games, the retailers who argued it would be a magnet for
shoppers throughout the north-west and the politicians who believed it would
generate 3,000 construction jobs and 6,000 permanent jobs thereafter.
In the other corner were its critics: the property owners, retailers and
local councillors who claimed that 1m sq ft of new shops on the outskirts of
Manchester would further damage business in the city. 'Our fear is that a
development of this size will have a profound effect on the town centre,'
said Mr John Ellison, a director of MEPC, the UK's second largest property
company.
Mr David Kaiserman, senior assistant city planning officer for Manchester
City Council, said: 'We see development of this type making it even more
difficult to achieve regeneration in the inner parts of the city.' Mr
Kaiserman is spokesman for a consortium of local authorities and property
developers that opposed the secretary of state's decision last week and are
considering whether to mount a High Court challenge.
Even the developers, the Manchester Ship Canal Company, accepted that the
arguments, which have raged for seven years, were not cut-and-dried.
'It was a knife-edge decision between planning considerations and economic
benefits,' said Mr Robert Hough, the company's chairman. 'Perversely, the
economic position may have helped; the government may have seen it as
creating 6,000 jobs at no public cost,' he added.
The schemes' critics accuse the government of changing its stance on
out-of-town retailing. 'We are surprised because the government's stated
policy is to protect existing shopping centres,' says Mr Ellison. This
belief stems chiefly from draft planning guidelines issued last October,
which appeared to emphasise the need to revitalise town centres, rather than
promote large out-of-town stores.
The guidelines talked about promoting the vitality and viability of town
centres and stressed the virtue of town centres in keeping private car use
to a minimum, reducing emissions of carbon dioxide.
They said that regional out-of-town shopping centres 'would not normally be
appropriate' if they would seriously jeopardise investment in nearby town
centres or unless there was likely to be a significant growth in population
or retail spending.
In the event, the government's decision on the Trafford Centre did little
more than mention these draft guidelines. 'While accepting that policy
guidance relating to town centres and retail development is still evolving,
the secretary of state does not consider that this means the proposals
before him should be refused planning permission on grounds of prematurity,'
said the DoE's letter explaining the decision.
In any case, the question of whether the Trafford Centre is likely to
jeopardise investment in town centres is hotly contested. An inquiry into
the Trafford Centre in 1988 found that it would not cause 'unacceptable harm
to the regeneration of the conurbation or to the vitality and viability of
any existing town centre'. But some retailers in the town centre have never
accepted this, believing that the more affluent shoppers will desert central
Manchester and its satellite towns.
Previous studies have focused on the 'Big Four' shopping centres -
Tyneside's MetroCentre, the UK's first out-of-town shopping centre, opened
in 1986, Meadowhall near Sheffield, Merry Hill in the West Midlands and
Lakeside in Essex.
Research published a year ago by the Oxford Institute of Retail Management,
commissioned by the Department of the Environment, found out-of-town sites
were adding to the plight of many town centres. But the general growth in
retail sales in the late 1980s softened the impact. The harsher economic
climate, and the gradual expiry of leases in town centres may further
encourage the retailers' desertion of the high street.
The Trafford Centre may turn out to be the last regional shopping centre to
be granted planning consent. With the exception of the south-west of
England, most of the country is now within reach of a regional centre. But
the arguments about the regional centres also apply to other types of
out-of-town stores, particularly supermarkets.
There is a fear that the growth of out-of-town food stores is hastening the
demise of local shops. The number of grocery shops has fallen in the last
three decades from more than 100,000 to 40,000, and the recession has
continued to throw up casualties.
This pressure is mounting, as the large supermarket groups target smaller
towns. Chesterton, the surveying firm, recently reported that the proportion
of large new food stores located in small towns has increased from less than
10 per cent in 1990 to about 25 per cent today.
At the same time, supermarket groups have been fiercely attacked for
building on greenfield sites and recreational land. This issue came to a
head last year, when protestors fought the development by Tesco of a
superstore on a former school playing field at Golden Hill in north-west
Bristol. The protest attracted extensive publicity as residents staged
vigils in trees to try to stop them being cut down.
One result was the formation of a pressure group, the National Sensitive
Sites Alliance, to fight supermarket developments on greenfield sites.
Earlier this year, a group of MPs tabled a motion calling for a moratorium
on such greenfield developments.
The supermarkets say that only a handful of their developments are on
greenfield sites, and that, recently, several chains have opened new high
street stores.
For all that, the attitude of retailers, consumers and investors suggests
that the increasing emphasis on out-of-town stores will not be relinquished
lightly.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Management: Paying the price for a decade of excess -
Executive salaries are being frozen and companies are waiving bonus schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders are becoming mutinous; employees resentful; John Major has
issued a warning and the press is ready to pounce. Britain's bosses are
under pressure from all sides to restrain, freeze or even cut their pay. The
economy is in the worst recession since the 1930s, wages are rising at the
lowest rate for decades and nearly every day brings news of thousands of job
losses.
Slowly the message is getting through to the boardroom, where a decade of
excess seems to be drawing to a close. According to the latest estimates
from Hay management consultants, directors are increasing their total pay at
the rate of about 8 per cent, compared with about 13 per cent last summer.
'The turn has come, the rates of increase are falling, and are going to come
down perhaps to 5 or 6 per cent by July,' says Anthony Williams, director of
executive renumeration at Hay.
Yet many argue directors are still paying themselves too much. On Hay's
numbers board directors are getting increases twice as large as middle
managers and professionals, and more than three times as much as employees
generally.
Howard Davies, director general of the CBI, this week complained: 'The
recent record on senior management pay is not easy to defend'. He pointed
out the reasons trotted out for big increases in top pay - closing the gap
with better paid European counterparts and adjusting to the fall in marginal
tax rates - no longer applied. 'Much-needed adjustment has now taken place,'
he said, warning any future rises would be taken in bad spirit.
As the annual reports for 1992 start to appear, more scrutiny than usual
will be given to the section on directors renumeration. The first storm can
be expected tomorrow with the publication of BP's accounts. Robert Horton,
the ex-chairman who was ousted last year after falling out with the
company's non-executive directors, is expected to receive Pounds 1m to
Pounds 1.5m for his pains.
Such a large sum is bound to increase the pressure for an overhaul to the
present system which appears to give particularly large rewards for failure.
Directors are entitled to full compensation for pay and benefits for their
contract period (three years in Horton's case) adjusted for the speed with
which they are likely to find a job on similar pay. When the company is
large and the fall from grace public, that may be a long time - and the
pay-off will be accordingly great.
The question of severance pay is a special issue; when it comes to pay rises
for directors that remain at their posts, companies are realising they
cannot afford another public storm. British Gas, which staged a public
relations disaster last year when it announced an 18 per cent pay rise for
its chairman Robert Evans, is hoping to earn brownie points this time
around. The chairman's pay is likely to fall by 20 per cent, as the bonus,
which accounted for last year's rise, will fall away. The pay of other
directors will be frozen.
British Gas will not be alone in waiving its bonus this year. Most large
companies' bonus schemes are tied to corporate profitability - usually to
growth in earnings per share - so that last year's poor corporate
performance in some sectors will be reflected in this year's pay awards.
According to Monks Partnership, a top pay consultancy, some 80 per cent of
main board directors are eligible for bonuses, but of these some 40 per cent
will not be getting anything this year. Of those that do get bonuses the
amounts will vary from a few percentage points to over 50 per cent of total
salary.
Meanwhile, other companies are taking steps to tie total reward more closely
to performance. Grand Met recently announced it was redesigning its share
options so that directors could only exercise them if the share price
out-performed the FT-SE100 for more than three years. This was in response
to the concern of shareholders that share options can provide windfall
rewards for any rise in the share price.
A more marked change this year will come less in the absolute levels of pay
than in the presentation of directors' pay in the report and accounts. Under
the Companies Act only the combined pay and bonus of the chairman and
highest paid director need be disclosed.
The Cadbury Committee on corporate governance has recommended that after
June companies should offer more information. The report advises companies
to split out the performance element in total directors' pay and do the same
for the pay of chairman and highest-paid director. Companies are also
expected to explain the basis of any incentive scheme and offer information
on the make-up of the remuneration committee.
According to Monks Partnership, only 16 per cent of the FT-SE100 companies
met these recommendations with their last annual reports. Although Cadbury's
recommendations are not binding, most big companies are likely to fall into
line this year.
Whether the modest increases in disclosure will effect pay awards is a moot
point. According to Steve Totton of Incomes Data Services it can be argued
either way. Perhaps companies have only been able to get away with paying
such large sums because they have not revealed precisely what they were
doing. Or, if they explained themselves more fully, everyone would
understand why the rises were so large and the heat would be taken out of
the issue.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Management: The secret of T&amp;N - A look at a company which
has defied City scepticism over its R&amp;D spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British manufacturing is crippled by short-termism. With rare exceptions
such as once-glamorous Glaxo, companies cannot invest and innovate their way
to greater international competitiveness because financial institutions and
the stock market are interested only in the level of short-term profits and
dividends.
That, in a wizened but remarkably resilient nutshell, is the complaint which
for a good 20 years has been hurled at the City of London by industrialists
and their supporters. At first they alleged capital investment was being
cramped. Then, when they discovered that it was easier to raise external
finance for major 'capex' projects than they thought, their concern shifted
to research and development.
Since 1990 their case on R&amp;D has won growing support within Whitehall, and
last summer even obliquely from the Bank of England.
So how on earth has T&amp;N, which was virtually bankrupt a decade ago because
of its previous dependence on asbestos, been able to use a steadily rising
R&amp;D outlay of Japanese and German proportions to power it almost to the top
of the world league in the increasingly competitive market for automotive
components?
Since 1988 its annual R&amp;D expenditure has doubled from Pounds 17m to Pounds
34m. In some of its businesses, R&amp;D spending as a percentage of sales is now
about 8 per cent.
Rephrased in stock market language, why have almost all of T&amp;N's
institutional shareholders remained patient for so long? Why is the same
true for some City analysts - although others remain sceptical? The company
has not only called on the market repeatedly for more capital, but its
profits were hit so hard by the recession they slid sharply from 1988 to
1991, before being wrenched up again by management action last year.
Yet somehow T&amp;N has got away with all this: its relatively poor share price
performance from 1987 until recently was caused more by scares over asbestos
claims, and worries about the motor industry as a whole, than by its outlook
 -although there have also been recurrent brokers' scares about the
dividend.
So what is its secret? The explanation is not simply the cynical one that
T&amp;N has maintained its pay-out for three years running.
There are at least six deeper factors. The first is the belief, of Colin
Hope, T&amp;N's chairman and chief executive, that 'although there is some
short-termism in the City, most of it is self-made by company managers who
want macho profit increases'.
His partial exoneration of the City is linked with point two: that T&amp;N has
spent untold time and trouble over the years educating analysts and
financial institutions that its strategy is sensible. 'We've tried to build
an awareness that our products and services are the things that will pull
the company forward - they'll provide more added value, and be better for
investors,' says Hope.
Echoing what he has told investors repeatedly, he stresses that 'product
development is a fundamental part of the marketing process. You can't turn
it on and off - it has to be continuous'. When, as with T&amp;N, almost all the
competition is American, German or Japanese, 'you certainly don't chicken
out when you're overhauling your rivals in the marketplace'.
The company has certainly been doing that. During the past decade it has
climbed from fifth to close second in the global league of independent
makers of pistons, and from third to first in bearings. It has also managed
to hold its third position in the even more difficult market for 'friction
products' (brake linings).
Third, Hope and board colleagues such as Bill Everitt, head of the friction
products and engineering division, ram home constantly the message that
since T&amp;N's products are almost all designed in response to the demands of
specific customer companies - from Ford to BMW, Nissan to Opel - its R&amp;D
spend really is 'market-driven'.
Fourth, only about 5 per cent of T&amp;N's so-called R&amp;D is really research.
Though some of its development projects can easily take five years from
inception to generate a return, 'you can tell in two or three years whether
the money is being well-spent and will produce a benefit', says Rob Golding,
motor industry analyst at Warburg Securities.
Fifth, T&amp;N has convinced investors it is as concerned with the productivity
of R&amp;D as with its quantity. This contrasts strongly, Hope points out, with
the grossly inflated R&amp;D spend of Goetze, the German piston rings company
which T&amp;N is acquiring. 'Ratios of R&amp;D-to-sales can be misleading: for half
Goetze's spend, we could get a lot more effectiveness,' Hope claims.
Sixth, this is by no means the only sense in which the company is now
conveying successfully the message that, in the chairman's words, 'we're
almost paranoiac about costs'. T&amp;N has developed a deserved reputation for
being just as tough a short-term operator as it is a long-term player.
Since the onset of the recession, its squeeze on operating costs has become
vicious. Having cut 6,300 jobs since 1990, Hope now says that 'we need to
reduce our labour force (of 38,000) for a constant value of output by an
annual 5 per cent over the next three years'. Not only that, but 'there's an
enormous amount of money still to come out of the saving of scrap in
production'.
'T&amp;N does a good job as a turnaround specialist,' confirms Golding. In
common with other analysts, after several years of scepticism he is
'reasonably convinced the Hope story is a good one'.
So he should be, for several strategic reasons. The short term will be
tough, but the world's main automotive assemblers are moving sharply towards
sub-contracting the design and manufacture of many more components, though
to fewer suppliers. This will benefit T&amp;N. So will the tightening of fuel,
emission and performance requirements, which are stimulating demand for
higher-performance components.
So will the devaluation of sterling. But for T&amp;N's ability to exploit these
trends, its shareholders must thank, above all, its long-term commitment to
technology.
A further article will examine how T&amp;N manages technology.

FT  12 MAR 93 / People: Priestley; 'investment in his life-blood'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One by one the familiar faces at Henderson Administration, one of the City's
best-connected fund managers, are bowing out. Hugh Priestley, 50, the
longest-serving member of Henderson's top team, is joining Laurence Keen, an
old-established private client fund manager.
Priestley started as a young reporter on The Times, and joined Henderson in
1966 when it was still best known for 'administering' the private fortunes
of the descendants of Alexander Henderson, the first Lord Faringdon. The
firm was not floated on the stock market until 1983 and its biggest
shareholder is the Witan Investment Company formed in 1909 to handle the
Henderson family's finances.
Witan remains Henderson's investment flagship and is still chaired by a Lord
Faringdon, a partner of Cazenove &amp; Co. But it has grown into Britain's fifth
biggest investment trust with over 8,000 shareholders and assets of Pounds
850m. For the past 12 years it has been managed by Hugh Priestley, who has
become one of the pillars of the investment trust establishment.
However, it is unusual to leave a manager in the same job for such a long
time. Michael Hart at Foreign &amp; Colonial and Lyndon Bolton at Alliance
Trust, are the obvious exceptions. Hence when Christopher Clarke, another
Henderson veteran, took over Witan at the start of the year, Priestley says
that he felt his role had been 'downsized'.
He stresses that his departure is amicable and has nothing to do with
Henderson's recent acquisition of Touche Remnant which created the UK's
leading investment trust manager. But his move to the 178-year-old Laurence
Keen, which manages around Pounds 1.5bn, suggests that he is better suited
to life in a business more akin to the old Henderson family firm.
Hamish Buchan, NatWest Markets' investment trust guru and a big fan, says
that Priest-ley has never been keen to advance his career by moving into
general management. 'To his eternal credit he has stuck to his last. He has
investment in his life-blood.'

FT  12 MAR 93 / People: Philips promotes Kevin Kennedy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Heavy losses last year at the Dutch electronics group Philips have
precipitated a round of senior management changes as a result of which Kevin
Kennedy, currently running Philips in the UK, moves back to the Netherlands
and is promoted on to the group management committee, his fourth job change
during the six years he has been at the company.
One of the priorities of Jan Timmer, installed as president in 1990, has
been to internationalise the management of Philips. There are now only four
Dutch members of the 13-strong group management committee, and Scots-born
Kennedy (right) becomes only the second Brit after Dudley Eustace, the
finance director, who joined from British Aerospace last year, to attain
that level of seniority.
Kennedy, 55, takes charge of the management of domestic appliances and
personal care products, a division he notes has been profitable for many
years. 'That will make a nice change of pace,' he commented this week. He
succeeds Jan Tollenaar, also 55, who has been moved into the newly created
position of chief operating officer within the problem consumer electronics
division.
Joining the group in 1986 from Honeywell, Kennedy quickly established
himself on the fast-track - being both the first British national appointed
a managing director as well as the first to run the UK operation. He had
only been doing the latter job for two years, having previously been in the
Netherlands as chairman and senior managing director of the information
systems division.
Another fellow countryman, John Whybrow, presently responsible for
industrial affairs in the UK, moves into Kennedy's seat.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row on Europe upsets MPs' normal
service - The daily business of Westminster under strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE behind-the-scenes relations between the government and the opposition
that keep the business of Westminster on the rails hit the buffer of
Maastricht this week.
The paper hats, the successive votes and the other disruptive antics of
Wednesday's proceedings - on matters completely unrelated to the treaty -
were a sign that the normal parliamentary arrangements between party whips
had broken down. The 'usual channels' were temporarily blocked.
Labour backbenchers' insistence on dragging MPs away from the dining tables
of Westminster to march through the voting lobbies was not about the
uncontroversial matters at issue, but was Labour's warning to the government
of how business would be conducted if it decided to make parliament sit
through the weekend on the Maastricht bill.
Tory recriminations yesterday about 'deplorable behaviour' underlined how
different it was from the normal run of business. In usual circumstances,
whatever the snarling across the chamber during debate, those who manage
parliamentary business have a close relationship.
It goes beyond the clubbability of getting on well with MPs of other parties
and reflects a recognition that political interests coincide more often than
publicly admitted.
Opposition spokesmen, like ministers, can see the advantage in not
prolonging some debates so that a sensitive issue is dealt with early in the
afternoon - in 'prime time' - rather than late at night when it will receive
much less media attention.
Party interests can even be served by different aspects of the same outcome.
A couple of hours of uproar in the Commons may be a price the government is
quite ready to pay to achieve its business. Each side can then try to
convince a sceptical press that it triumphed and its opponents were
embarrassed.
The front benches also agree that the Commons does not need to spend much
time on uncontentious matters which are of limited or specialist interest.
Thus Westminster processes much more legislation than is generally noticed,
as orders are approved en bloc, taken without debate, or referred to a
Commons committee where a few MPs give them rather more consideration.
As Wednesday's events showed, the disadvantage of this is that Commons
business can be derailed relatively easily if tempers unexpectedly fray or
an ambush is organised.
From the start, Maastricht has been somewhat outside the usual agreements
because Labour could not rule out hitting the government if the Tory rebels
brought it down.
Until now, however, it has been fairly self-contained. The government has
been able to get much of its legislation through the Commons already, and so
far has had to impose a 'guillotine' motion to cur-tail debate on only one
bill.
Wednesday's events may mark a watershed that changes all that. Within the
procedural rules but outside the parliamentary conventions is a rarely
explored area for troublemakers.
It could well become familiar territory before the Maastricht bill finally
reaches the statute book.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major attacked over R-R job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, was fiercely attacked by Labour MPs in
the Commons yesterday when he insisted that the 'distressing' job losses
announced by Rolls-Royce did not warrant government intervention, Ivor Owen
writes.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, contrasted the prime minister's
'do-nothing' attitude to the loss of 5,000 engineering jobs with his recent
assurances that manufacturing mattered to the government.
Mr Major accused Mr Smith of forgetting the government's measures to secure
economic growth and international competitiveness.
The prime minister was adamant that the country did not need the kind of
'nannying intervention' advocated by the Labour leader.
Mr Smith scoffed: 'That litany of self-serving excuses gives no comfort to
the 5,000 people who are going to lose their jobs'. The prime minister
emphasised that Rolls-Royce, like its US competitors, was shedding jobs
because of the international market.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers scale back plan for
generator coal stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is scaling down proposals to cajole electricity generators
into keeping large stocks of coal as a means of keeping open some of the 31
threatened pits.
The revision of its plans will increase fears in the coal industry that the
white paper, due in the next few weeks, will save just a handful of pits.
Slowing a planned reduction in generator stockpiles was one of the main
proposals in a draft white paper through which the Department of Trade and
Industry hoped to save 10 to 12 of the pits.
A government decision against persuading generators to keep stockpiles well
above commercial requirements would reduce the number of saved pits.
The generators have indicated they could take about 40m tonnes over five
years - above existing tentative deals - provided agreements can be reached
on issues including how the government subsidises it.
At the government's instigation talks have begun between British Coal and
the generators on this extra coal. These are far from nearing conclusion.
Anything above the 40m could involve stocking considerably above the
generators' commercial needs. But the DTI has made no response to proposals
made three weeks ago by the generators on stocking.
This does not mean the proposals have been abandoned, but industry sources
believe the government is scaling back its plans in part because of the cost
of stocking. PowerGen told the government it wanted compensation of more
than Pounds 140m for keeping stocks at existing high levels.
National Power appeared to be adopting a tougher stance still, saying it did
not want excess coal on its books because of the effects on its borrowing
requirements.
Meanwhile, the government is putting pressure on some of the regional
electricity companies to dismantle contracts with Nuclear Electric. This
would facilitate conclusion of tentative deals between British Coal and the
generators and parallel deals with the regional companies. It is expected
that at least one such switch will be agreed.

PILOT TESTS carried out last year in preparation for the compulsory testing
of English for all 14-year-olds revealed 'unacceptable' reading and writing
levels, Mr John Patten, education secretary told MPs yesterday, John Willman
writes.
One in three of the 12,000 14-year-olds who took part in the pilot had the
reading and writing ability of an average 11-year-old or less, Mr Patten
told the Commons education committee. About 5 per cent were only at the
level of an average seven-year-old.
The tests were conducted in 102 schools across England to pilot the
compulsory testing of all 14-year-olds in English which begins this summer.
Mr Patten said that the figures were 'disturbing' and showed the importance
of testing to identify children who need extra help and direct it to them.
The minister appealed to teaching unions not to boycott the tests. Earlier
this week the NAS/UWT, the second largest teachers' union, said its members
had voted overwhelmingly to boycott assessment and testing associated with
the national curriculum.
The NUT, the largest teaching union, will ballot its members in May over
plans to boycott just the English tests for 14-year-olds.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: 'Budget for jobs' demanded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BUDGET for jobs next Tuesday was demanded by the two main opposition
parties yesterday - but Labour's latest proposals for finding funds by
plugging Pounds 2bn of tax loopholes were overshadowed by the Liberal
Democrats' call for an extra Pounds 4bn of borrowing.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, also called for the long-term
unemployed to be given vouchers, equivalent to an employment subsidy, to
make them more attractive to employers.
The Liberal Democrats are opposed to tax increases, but also want Pounds 4bn
of public investment in school buildings, railways and housing, funded by
borrowing.
'I doubt whether you can achieve a significant boost to recovery if you
don't have additional capital spending which requires additional borrowing,'
said Mr Alan Beith, their Treasury spokesman.
The Liberal Democrats' voucher scheme is similar to proposals put forward by
Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, and Professor Dennis Snower of
Birkbeck College, London. Mr Ashdown said it would encourage an expansion in
employment and cost the government very little.
Employers would have to show that they were making a genuine addition to
their workforce - or would spend the equivalent of the voucher on training.
For Labour, Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said ministers' claims
that action on unemployment was prevented by a lack of resources were
untenable. 'The real issue is whether the government has the political will
to tackle and conquer unemployment,' he said.
Labour has already proposed a windfall tax on utilities and the phased
release of local authority capital receipts.
Mr Brown said six tax loopholes need to be plugged:
Companies that believe they may have to pay tax on future capital gains in
effect cancel them out by buying companies which have made a capital loss.
Companies with a big Advance Corporation Tax liability paying another
company for a tax offset instead of paying the tax.
The tax structure for UK trusts - which allows trust holders to pay 35 per
cent on income in their trusts instead of the 40 per cent higher rate of
income tax.
Energy companies 'manipulating' the prices of oil cargoes given for tax
purposes to cut their Petroleum Revenue Tax bills.
Farms and businesses transferred after death that have been able to escape
both inheritance tax and capital gains tax.
Top-rate taxpayers making a risk-free return by investing in Business
Expansion Schemes companies set up to invest in repossessed properties.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: NUM executive supports 24-hour
strike on closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXECUTIVE of the National Union of Mineworkers authorised its members
yesterday to stage a 24-hour strike on April 2 in protest at the
government's plan of pit closures and job losses.
The date chosen coincides with a planned day of worker action organised by
the European Trade Union Confederation over unemployment and redundancies
across Europe.
The mineworkers' decision follows a ballot of members last week which gave
60 per cent support for a strike and further industrial action. But the
miners' action is not going to bring Britain's coalfields to a standstill as
was first thought.
Yesterday Nacods, the pit deputies' union, announced it had narrowly failed
to secure the two-thirds majority it needed to call a one-day strike with
2,036 (64 per cent) voting for a strike and 1,144 (36 per cent) against.
Mr Peter McNestry, Nacods' general secretary, said he was 'very
disappointed' by the outcome of the ballot.
British Coal expressed relief yesterday at the Nacods decision. Mr Kevan
Hunt, the corporation's industrial relations director, said: 'The vote by
the deputies means that miners who wish to work normally if the NUM members
persist with their reckless action can do so. A substantial part of the
coalfields will be working normally.'
The Nacods ballot has come as a setback to the campaign spearheaded by the
NUM for co-ordinated militant action. Members of the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers will be working normally on April 2. They have not been balloted
on any strike action.
The NUM leadership will now have to wait until next week to find out whether
its members will be campaigning on their own or with the 63,000 members of
RMT, the transport union.
The union has held a strike ballot and the result will be known later in the
month.
RMT members are being asked to strike in opposition to British Rail's
failure to guarantee that there will not be compulsory redundancies on the
network as a result of privatisation.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories draw back from Maastricht
row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WIDELY expected confrontation between pro-Maastricht Conservative
backbenchers and the Euro-sceptic faction was defused at the 11th hour last
night on the orders of Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip.
Instead a crowded meeting of the 1922 committee - the group that embraces
all Tory backbenchers - broke up after just five minutes when officers of
the group relayed the call for a public display of peace.
But before the brief meeting closed, Sir Marcus Fox, the committee's
chairman, admitted that he had received a letter signed by some 85
pro-Europeans. It cited past precedent to back the claim that the committee
was originally formulated to ensure support for the government whip. The
letter's aim is to renew pressure on some five Euro-sceptic members not to
oppose the government in crucial votes on the Maastricht bill.
Pro-Maastricht MPs described themselves as satisfied that their point had
been taken without a row. 'Discreet action is more effective than open
warfare,' one said.
Belying the spirit of the truce, one leading Euro-sceptic countered that
their opponents' failure to press home their attack represented another
victory for the rebels.
In spite of the public display of unity there were few in the Commons who
had any doubt that the trench warfare was continuing behind the scenes. As
government business managers tried to raise the numbers needed to extend
debate on the bill until after the normal closure of 10pm, the Euro-sceptics
could be seen conferring openly with Labour whips over whether such a move
could be defeated.
The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, were reported to be divided over tactics -
split between those anxious to be seen to be aiding progress of the bill and
others not keen to help the government.
Earlier Mr John Major reiterated his determination at the weekly cabinet
meeting to see the legislation through. At question time the prime minister
attacked Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, and a Tory
backbencher for delaying the bill's progress.
However, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, adopted what appears now to
be the government's official tone by offering a conciliatory speech on
subsidiarity to a Commons' chamber dominated by Euro-sceptics.
At business questions Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, made clear that
slow progress on the bill could mean MPs might be forced to continue sitting
into August, normally the summer recess.
Unofficial calculations suggest that, almost without question, the
government is now reliant on support from minority parties to stave off
defeat on Labour's controversial social chapter amendment.
Although the government's law officers have taken the position that passage
of the amendment - which seeks to remove the protocol containing Britain's
social chapter opt-out - would still allow it to ratify the treaty, it would
take Britain into uncharted legal territory.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: City seeks action to curb deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPINION in the City is hardening in favour of action by Mr Norman Lamont in
next week's Budget to curb the growing government deficit.
Tax increases of Pounds 3bn to Pounds 5bn to take effect in the financial
year starting next month are favoured by an increasing number of City
economists.
Many would like Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to tighten fiscal policy
but to delay any measures until the Budget in November, which will apply to
the 1994-95 financial year.
The fear that tax increases in the Budget will threaten any recovery is
misplaced, according to Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank. He
says a fiscal tightening of up to Pounds 4bn, accompanied by cuts in public
spending, would reassure financial markets that Mr Lamont was acting to
limit the rising fiscal deficit, set to reach about Pounds 50bn in the
coming financial year.
However, Mr John Shepperd, economist at the SG Warburg Securities investment
house, says any increase in taxes would depress confidence among consumers
and industrialists, and might delay an upturn. 'The government then might be
faced with a nightmare scenario of the recession lasting even longer, with
the deficit also growing because of the effects of a slowdown on pushing up
spending and cutting into tax revenues,' he said.
Among those economists wanting to see an increase in taxation, favoured
moves are to widen the scope of value added tax, through applying this to
some currently zero-rated items such as food and books.
Extra revenues could also be raised through putting up income tax allowances
at less than the inflation rate, or raising excise duties on alcohol and
tobacco by more than inflation.
Also being mooted among economists in the City are 'green' taxes such as
extra taxes on fuel and petrol which could be presented as helping the
environment.
'Mr Lamont should tackle the rising fiscal deficit through a tax increase in
1993-94 of Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn. More tax rises should be phased in for the
next financial year, with monetary policy loosened to compensate. Interest
rates should come down from 6 per cent to 5 per cent immediately, with
possibly more cuts later.'
Michael Saunders, Salomon Brothers
'Mr Lamont should cut government spending in the coming financial year by
Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn, at the same time putting up taxes by Pounds
3bn-Pounds 4bn. The measures would hit consumers' pockets, but would lift
confidence in financial markets. They would show the government was at last
taking tough measures rather than drifting.'
Roger Bootle, Midland Bank
'Taxes should rise by about Pounds 3bn in the coming financial year, through
measures such as increased value added tax, especially on fuels where the
change could be presented as a 'green' measure. I am increasingly confident
about a recovery, at the current level of interest rates.'
Peter Spencer, Kleinwort Benson
'The chancellor should announce tax rises, but taking place not until
1994-95. This would help convince markets that the government was taking the
deficit seriously. Mr Lamont should also announce a proper framework for
running the economy based on monetary targeting, possibly with further cuts
in interest rates.'

FT  12 MAR 93 / The Taurus Collapse: Lamont's Pounds 800m windfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION to abandon Taurus could provide Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, with windfall savings of about Pounds 800m a year, but should
not result in any last-minute alteration to his Budget plans, Peter Norman
writes.
In the 1990 Budget, Mr John Major, then chancellor, announced plans to
abolish the 0.5 per cent stamp duty on share transactions to coincide with
the introduction of Taurus. But in January this year the Stock Exchange said
it would not be 'going live' with the computer settlement system until April
1994.
That means Mr Lamont will have been able to take account of the revenues
from stamp duty into his Budget. Treasury officials estimate that stamp duty
on share transactions produces between Pounds 800m and Pounds 900m in a
financial year. The duty yielded Pounds 1.7bn in 1991-92 of which roughly 50
per cent came from share transfers.

FT  12 MAR 93 / The Taurus Collapse: Harsh post-mortem reveals flaws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOO ambitious, too complicated and badly managed
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
these are the conclusions yesterday from the first post-mortems carried out
on the body of Taurus.
The Stock Exchange and financial institutions around the City put the blame
squarely on the compromise hammered out between registrars and other City
interests in 1989. This had resulted in a complicated decentralised system
designed around a series of databases maintained by a range of financial
institutions.
It was to be tied together by a communication system with a level of
security which the exchange boasted would be the most secure in use anywhere
in the world outside the defence establishment. It proved impossible to
build.
An emergency review conducted for the exchange last autumn by Andersen
Consulting said that such a complicated system was 'inoperable', Sir Andrew
Hugh Smith, exchange chairman, said. It would take at least 15 months to
rebuild the system, and up to three years to bring it into operation.
The lesson was not lost on the exchange and the Bank of England yesterday.
'If there are going to be industry-wide services, they've got to aim at the
optimal result, not the acceptable result,' Sir Andrew said.
The second significant flaw was the exchange's own failure to manage the
development effectively. From the beginning, financial institutions had
warned of the difficulties.
Until August 1989 there was no project director with overall responsibility
for Taurus, only a technical team working on the project. The exchange
brought in Mr John Watson, a consultant from Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, which
merged later with Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Yesterday his team was by implication blamed for failing to realise earlier
that the project could not be completed at an acceptable cost. Sir Andrew
did not name him but said: 'We were testing parts of the system while others
had not been designed or built. It was only at the heart of the project that
this was known.'
Sir Andrew said 'there may have been an element of self-delusion' among the
Taurus project staff which had prevented them from seeing the enormity of
the problems at an earlier stage. Senior exchange executives outside the
project had no idea of the fundamental flaws in the system.
Mr Watson was a former deputy chief executive of the exchange who had lost
out in the race for the chief executive's job to Mr Jeffery Knight, Mr
Rawlins' predecessor. A dogged, hard-working man, he was seen as giving the
project the best chance it had. There have been few if any calls for his
resignation over the years.
Doubts began to gather at the exchange last autumn. At the start of 1992,
the exchange had reviewed the system and decided to proceed, though with a
strengthened management team under Mr Watson.
Last October Ms Jane Barker, the exchange's finance director - and yesterday
appointed its chief operating officer - was given overall responsibility for
the project.
It was after her appointment that the severity of the problems started to
become clear, Sir Andrew said. When Andersen Consulting was called in to
examine the project its advice, which came as a shock, was that the project
was inoperable and should be scrapped.
Early this year the technical side of the project was given to Mr Stewart
Senior, a consultant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and an urgent review began. Ten
days ago, the exchange realised, there was no option but to end the project.
'If you're building a house, you see the foundations going in and the roof
being put on. It's not like that with a technology project. It's an
invisible palace, rather than a brick house,' Sir Andrew said.
Yesterday, the invisible palace turned out to be a mirage.

FT  12 MAR 93 / The Taurus Collapse: Angry City takes stock of lost money
and time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY was angry and surprised at yesterday's confirmation that the Stock
Exchange was cancelling the Taurus share settlement system.
Even after news leaked out on Wednesday that Taurus was likely to be
scrapped, many had not expected such a move.
Mr Michael Lawrence, finance director of the Prudential and chairman of the
100 Group of leading finance directors, said: 'A number of companies have
invested a lot of time and money in Taurus. I hope something can be
salvaged.'
Ms Judith Vincent, head of company and commercial law at the Confederation
of British Industry, said no one had been expecting the news - the CBI had
been planning a conference with the Stock Exchange for June on Taurus.
'Don't intrude on private grief,' she said. 'This is a shock. Certainly no
one expected it.'
Companies were counting the costs of cancellation. One stockbroking firm
estimated that it had spent about Pounds 1m on preparations for Taurus.
Estimates of banks' expenditure as share custodians and registrars vary. One
banker estimates that service registrars have spent between Pounds 30m and
Pounds 40m in the past three years on developing Taurus-suitable computer
systems.
Mr Martin Dorset, commercial director of Premier Systems, a computer
software company which had spent more than Pounds 1.5m working on
Taurus-related packages, said: 'It is a wasted investment for us, our
clients and everyone else in the market. It is fairly painful.'
Mr Geoffrey Madrell, head of Pro Share, said: 'The whole thing was put
together by committee. Now all the compromises have broken out into the
open.'
Mr David Adams, chief executive of Manchester's Henry Cooke Lumsden, one of
the leading firms of stockbrokers outside London, said: 'It's devastating
that so much money has been wasted. The whole thing has been driven by big
institutions and the notion that you had to have lots of interlinked systems
to ensure competition.'
Mr Robert Binney, business executive for global securities services in
Europe for Chase Manhattan, said: 'We will be the laughing stock of Europe.
We have a Third World settlement system in a first-rank financial centre.'
He said the Bank of England task force would have to risk some vested
interests being 'bent out of shape' in order to produce an automated
settlement system quickly.
Mr Terry Pearson, head of global custody at Royal Bank of Scotland, said the
bank had spent 'many millions' on Taurus, and that it had 'all gone down the
tubes totally'. Attention should now be focused on automating settlement for
institutional trading, leaving retail bargains on the current paper-based
system. 'The result might be a two-tier market. If that is unavoidable, we
should do it.'
Mr Christopher Bull, finance director of RTZ, said he was 'shocked' by the
news, and called the Stock Exchange's failed development a 'fiasco'. He said
it damaged the credibility of the UK software industry if it could not
devise a system that worked after the time and money spent on it.
Institutional fund managers were highly critical of the exchange. 'We are
the laughing stock of Europe,' said Mr Gordon Lindsey, managing director of
custody and investor services at the UK's largest fund manager, Mercury
Asset Management. 'It's done serious harm to London as an international
financial centre.'
Britain is one of the few countries not to offer paperless trading and
settlement. Germany, France, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Hong Kong and even a
few emerging markets such as Taiwan, Korea and Indonesia have such trading.
Countries with such a service generally have speedier, cheaper settlement
systems, according to the institutional investors who use them though most
exchanges with paperless trading deal in 'bearer' shares which do not
designate ownership.
In the US, most transactions are 'demobilised' - all share certificates are
placed in a central depository, the Depository Trust Company, and settlement
is via book entry systems.
Private investors wishing to possess share transactions may do so - after
paying administrative costs.
'It is possible that the answer for Britain is a US-type system,' said Mr
Michael Robarts, a director of Fleming Asset Management.
Italy, once described by fund managers as a nightmarish stock exchange where
transactions could remain unsettled for months, may offer some lessons.
Following the stock market crash of October 1987, the Italian government
worked on making Monte Titoli, the securities clearing and settlement system
established in 1978, more effective. Such was their success that by 1992 it
held securities valued at L100,000bn, and there are now no physical
exchanges in the daily settlement of transactions in the Bank of Italy's
settlement rooms.

FT  12 MAR 93 / The Taurus Collapse: Stock Exchange chief failed to tame the
bull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Rawlins, who resigned yesterday as chief executive of the exchange,
has said he subscribes to the General Custer management method: run fast
enough to stay ahead of the arrows. In the end he was trampled by Taurus the
bull.
'It is a good thing that he has resigned,' said the head of one of London's
biggest investment banking houses. 'He has lost credibility.'
Mr Rawlins was appointed to the exchange in 1989 partly because of his
computer expertise. There were already fears that Taurus was too ambitious
and critics say he should have abandoned the system earlier. But his
Achilles heel has been his knack of making enemies. A broker said: 'The
problem with Peter is that he always thinks he knows best.'
When he arrived at the exchange it was a huge, inward-looking and unwieldy
organisation, not sure whether it was a regulator, a trade lobby group, a
commercial business or a provider of market services. It employed about
3,000 bureaucrats and strategy was the preserve of some 90 committees and
sub-committees, typically made up of superannuated stockbrokers who had only
reluctantly acceded to government pressure to deregulate the market in the
Big Bang of 1986.
Mr Rawlins had little direct experience of the stock market. He trained as
an accountant at Arthur Andersen - and ironically it was a report on
Taurus's shortcomings by Andersen's consultancy arm at the end of last year
which precipitated yesterday's events. He had also worked for Sturge, the
insurance broker, and had been seconded to the Lloyd's insurance market in
the early 1980s as personal assistant to Mr Ian Hay Davison, then chief
executive.
He lived up to his reputation as a cost cutter. There are now just 16
exchange committees, while staff numbers were reduced to 1,400 - and
yesterday by a further 220.
He also tried to make the exchange more responsive to its customers by
inviting industrialists on to its main board.
Much of the City old guard and many exchange employees were incensed by
these actions. Those who ran the big securities houses were behind him but
many have now been alienated. One leading broker commented: 'In the
beginning he was definitely the right man. But he stopped listening to the
industry.'
He has since managed to alienate many supporters. One said: 'Often he does
not appear to listen to what the industry is telling him. He always thinks
he knows best.'

FT  12 MAR 93 / The Taurus Collapse: Lamont is handed Pounds 800m windfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION to abandon Taurus should provide Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, with windfall savings of about Pounds 800m a year, but should
not result in any last-minute alteration to his Budget plans.
In the 1990 Budget, Mr John Major, who was then chancellor, announced plans
to abolish the 0.5 per cent stamp duty on share transactions to coincide
with the introduction of Taurus. But in January this year, as the chancellor
began planning next Tuesday's Budget, the Stock Exchange said it would not
be 'going live' with the settlement system until April 1994.
That means Mr Lamont will have been able to factor the revenues from stamp
duty into his Budget planning for the coming financial year. The Treasury
had already become used to repeated delays in the promised introduction of
the system.
Treasury officials estimate that stamp duty on share transactions produces
between Pounds 800m and Pounds 900m in a financial year - equivalent to
about  1/2 a percentage point on the basic 25 per cent rate of income tax.
Stamp duty yielded Pounds 1.7bn in 1991-92 of which roughly 50 per cent came
from share transfers. Stamp duty is expected to yield less - Pounds 1.39bn -
in the current financial year. That is because the temporary suspension of
stamp duty payments on most house sales between December 1991 and last
August cost the government an estimated Pounds 290m in 1992-93.
Mr Lamont's exact plans for stamp duty in 1993-94 and after April 1994 are
shrouded in pre-Budget secrecy. Other European Community countries have been
removing stamp duty from share transactions, partly because a draft EC
directive in 1986 suggested such action.
The directive, however, was not adopted and the UK government is under no
obligation to follow suit.

FT  12 MAR 93 / The Taurus Collapse: Resignation of Rawlins considered 'a
good thing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER RAWLINS, who resigned yesterday as chief executive of the Stock
Exchange, has said he subscribes to the General Custer management method:
'Run fast enough to stay ahead of the arrows.' In the end he was trampled by
a bull called Taurus.
'It is a good thing that he has resigned', said the head of one of London's
biggest investment banking houses. 'He has lost credibility on too many
issues.'
He was brought in to the exchange in 1989 in part because he was thought to
have expertise in developing computer systems. There were already fears that
the proposed new system was too ambitious, and it was hoped the new
technocrat would sort them out.
He may have been at fault in not abandoning Taurus earlier, but his Achilles
heel has been his knack of making enemies.
It was inevitable that he would face some opposition if he was to carry out
the task he had been set by the chairman, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, of
modernising the exchange.
It had become a huge, inward-looking and unwieldy organisation, not sure
whether it was a regulator, a trade lobby group, a commercial business or a
provider of market services. It employed around 3,000 bureaucrats, and
strategy was the preserve of some 90 committees and sub-committees,
typically made up of superannuated stockbrokers who had only reluctantly

FT  12 MAR 93 / Squashed tomato in cash squeeze: Comic Relief's drive to
avoid a further slide in donations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S Red Nose Day is a testing time for the organisers of the Comic
Relief charity event.
The last Red Nose Day in 1991 raised Pounds 21m, Pounds 6m less than the
first in 1989. This year, anything less than Pounds 21m will raise questions
about whether the event is running out of steam.
In light of the recession, Comic Relief's organisers have this year adopted
a more systematic approach towards corporate sponsors. Thus, besides mass
appeals to individual donors, several household-name companies are
supporting Comic Relief via direct sponsorship and donations from sales.
Companies will pay a total of more than Pounds 500,000 in sponsorship for
what is in effect the use of Comic Relief's logo - a squashed tomato this
year. But the actual figure for contributions will be much higher through
the various forms of red nose being sold by the participating companies.
Woolworths, part of the Kingfisher group, has raised at least Pounds 1.4m by
selling more than 2m red noses for people to wear. DHL, the courier company,
has supplied large red noses to hang on the outside of buildings. Shell
petrol stations have been selling car and truck noses. The Sainsbury
supermarket chain has been selling red noses to hang on doors.
Kodak and Mars have also run promotions. Kodak is donating 50p for every
voucher sent in from a throwaway 35mm camera, and Mars is making a 3p
donation from every pack sold of red nose M&amp;Ms confectionery.
Kellogg has been giving away red nose bicycle reflectors in special packs of
Rice Krispies, and clothing retailer C&amp;A has been selling red nose T-shirts.
For the companies, there are spin-offs from being associated with such a
high-profile charity event as Comic Relief.
In 1991 Sainsbury's staff participated informally in Comic Relief events.
'When Comic Relief approached us this time it seemed a good idea to
formalise the relationship,' said Mr Tim Johns, Sainsbury's head of
corporate public relations. 'We felt it was good for our customers and good
for staff morale.'
Mr Andrew Lazenby, Shell petrol stations' promotions manager, estimates that
more than 500,000 car and truck noses have been sold, giving Comic Relief at
least a further Pounds 650,000.
'It's very difficult to quantify the commercial benefits to ourselves that
our association with Comic Relief, or any charitable event, brings,' said Mr
Lazenby.
'But Comic Relief is a particularly commercially aware charity; they are the
only people I've spoken to, be they companies or charities, who know exactly
what we need to drive people into our sites.'
The red nose for buildings is a relatively new development; in 1991 Comic
Relief persuaded 250 mostly media-related companies to pay about Pounds
1,000 each for the nose. This year Comic Relief looked for a
business-to-business service company with a large database of clients and
the infrastructure to support the event.
DHL has sold at least 850 building noses, which are Pounds 295 each, this
year. Mr Doug West, DHL's head of public relations and sponsorship, said
DHL's involvement with Comic Relief had a commercial as well as charitable
point: 'Commercially it gives us brand awareness and benefit by association
with a very high-profile event.'

SCOTTISH NUCLEAR, the state-owned power company, has approached foreign

stations at a cheaper price than British Nuclear Fuels charges.
'We will buy the fuel in Britain if we can,' said Mr James Hann, chairman of
Scottish Nuclear. 'But if we cannot get it at a reasonable price we will go
overseas.'
Although BNF is the world's only AGR fuel supplier, Scottish Nuclear is
investigating the possibility of financing the creation of AGR fuel
production facilities at the foreign companies. It is understood to have
made informal approaches to companies in the US, Japan and France.
BNF and Scottish Nuclear agreed in principle early last year on fuel
supplies and the reprocessing of spent fuel covering the next 15 years.
In a big departure from established practice in the UK nuclear industry, it
was agreed that Scottish Nuclear could store its spent fuel on its sites in
dry stores instead of sending it for reprocessing to BNF's Pounds 5bn
Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) at Sellafield in Cumbria.
Scottish Nuclear recently gave evidence to a planning inquiry into its
application to build a dry store at Torness, Lothian, and will soon apply to
build one at Hunterston, Ayrshire.
Scottish Nuclear's decision to cut the amount of fuel it sends for
reprocessing was a serious blow to BNF.
Scottish Nuclear is stepping up pressure on BNF as part of a drive to reduce
its Pounds 400m annual operating costs by about a quarter over the next
three years.
Its agreements in principle with BNF, which cover contracts worth about
Pounds 2.7bn, have not been signed.
Scottish Nuclear made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 14m in 1991-92 and expects
to double that in the year to March 31. Although there is no nuclear levy in
Scotland, it sells its power to Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric
on long-term contracts at above the market price for electricity.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Minister says EC laws will not delay tendering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIAM WALDEGRAVE, minister for public service, said yesterday that
European Community legislation protecting employees' rights in mergers will
not delay plans to put almost Pounds 1.5bn of Civil Service work out to
tender.
The minister was responding to confusion over whether work contracted out to
the private sector is covered by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) regulations 1981, which implement the EC legislation in UK law.
If the regulations apply, a successful bidder must take over staff on their
existing terms and conditions - reducing scope for savings through lower pay
or staff cuts.
The uncertainty has already affected contracting-out in several government
departments including the Home Office and the Crown Prosecution Service.
Contracting-out began last November and the initial phase of tendering in
most areas of the Civil Service is due to be completed by the end of
September this year. But contractors have warned that the uncertainty could
wreck plans to increase the programme.
Mr Waldegrave said that the question of whether the regulations apply had to
be decided on the facts of each case. Even when Tupe rules applied, he
expected bidders to be able to make 'genuinely innovative proposals' that
would offer good value for money.
The minister has published guidelines on the scope of the regulations. These
set out the factors that are likely to mean that a contract is affected by
Tupe, such as contracts where the new employer takes on 'substantially the
same staff to do the same work as before, using the same premises and the
same equipment'.
Later, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said he would continue to
take legal action against local authorities which use the confusion to
insist that contractors take over existing staff.
Mr Howard said, however, that councils can specify that Tupe regulations
will apply where it is clear 'at the point of inviting tenders that this
would necessarily be the case'.
Mr Jack Straw, a Labour environment spokesman, described Mr Howard's
statement as 'a climb-down'. He added that the minister had 'tacitly
admitted that the Tupe regulations may cover compulsory competitive
tendering'.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Lord Chancellor acted unfairly in competitive tendering
exercise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD MACKAY, the Lord Chancellor, acted unfairly in the competitive
tendering exercise which led to contracts being awarded for shorthand
writing services in a group of courts in England, the High Court ruled
yesterday.
Lord Justice Rose and Mr Justice Waller expressed sympathy for the victims
but said they had no jurisdiction to declare what had happened unlawful.
The ruling was a test-case application for judicial review by Hibbit and
Sanders, one of the oldest firms of official shorthand writers in the
country. The firm challenged Lord Mackay's decision to award a rival bidder
the three-year contract starting in April for the Chelmsford group of crown
courts, in which it has operated since 1907.
Lord Justice Rose said the Lord Chancellor's Department had allowed some
companies which were seeking contracts to cover courts in England and Wales
to put in second, lower bids, while denying other tenderers, including
Hibbit and Sanders, the same opportunity.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Controversy over Birt grows at BBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of BBC governors expect an 'unholy row' at next Thursday's meeting
of the board of governors over the tax arrangements of Mr John Birt,
director-general.
The controversy over Mr Birt being employed as a freelance consultant since
1987 until last week grew last night amid claims that the BBC personnel
department has regularly suggested that he should join the staff.
There was also speculation that a more formal attempt to persuade him to
join the staff was made at the highest level in the corporation last year
but Mr Birt decided to retain his freelance status.
His arrangement will be raised as a matter of urgency at the meeting by
governors who are outraged at the situation.
One governor said last night: 'John Birt has put himself in an untenable
position and it is up to him to sort it out.'
On Monday the board of management expressed support for Mr Birt, who was
appointed deputy director-general six years ago.
Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman, and Lord Barnett, vice-chairman, also
expressed their backing for Mr Birt on Monday. However, no mention was made
of any other governors supporting the director-general.
It is believed that a number of other governors were canvassed for their
support before the statement of support was released but that some wanted to
meet before giving their support.
It is believed that Mr Hussey and Lord Barnett handled the unusual
arrangement whereby Mr Birt was taken on as a freelance deputy
director-general while not being on the staff and negotiations for him to
remain a freelance when he became director-general.
There was a growing suspicion last night that other governors were not told
of the arrangement.
Mr Birt took over from Sir Michael Checkland as director-general at the end
of last year. A controversial decision had earlier been taken not to
advertise the post of director-general and to offer an extension of only one
year to Sir Michael's five-year contract. The decision is believed to have
been passed only by the casting vote of Mr Hussey.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Government delays proposal to widen M25
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S plan to construct link roads on either side of the M25
motorway between its junctions with the M3 and M4 has been delayed until
after the county council elections in May.
In its consultation paper on the M25 last summer, the Department of
Transport proposed constructing three-lane link roads to carry local traffic
and help unclog Britain's busiest stretch of motorway. More than half the
traffic joining the M25 from the M3 and the M4 leaves within a couple of
junctions.
One Tory MP who asked not to be named, said: 'It is understandable
(ministers) don't want to get (the scheme) mixed up with the council
elections as so many people are against it.'
The publication of draft plans for the widening, possibly leading to a
public inquiry, was originally expected this spring but is now not
anticipated for months. The scheme is expected to cost Pounds 144m - with a
tenth of that earmarked for environmental protection - and to be completed
in 1998. The Department of Transport denied that the plans had been delayed
but said: 'As a general rule we do not make announcements in the run-up to
local elections because it takes away attention from the candidates.'
Twenty-three local authorities that have grouped together to fight the
scheme have called on Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, to look at
ways of improving public transport instead. Mr Ted Massey, secretary of the
Local Authority M25 Consortium, said yesterday: 'We are concerned that the
link roads between junctions 12 and 15 could set a precedent for widening
the M25 throughout.'
Surrey MPs have also formed an action group to press the government to
reconsider. Sir Michael Grylls, Tory MP for Surrey North West, said that
charging motorists for the use of roads to reduce traffic levels would be a
better policy.
It is becoming clear that the long-awaited statement from the Department of
the Environment on the proposed East Thames Corridor development is likely
to be much diluted from the original proposals to develop the region put
forward in 1991 by Mr Michael Heseltine when environment secretary.
Building construction consultants who advised the environment department at
the outset had a conception of the area - from Tower Bridge in London to
Southend, Essex, and Sheerness, Kent - as 'a huge linear city on both sides
of the Thames'. Since then, however, development pressure on the green belt,
one of the motives for the scheme, has eased.
While the department's statement on the corridor is expected to preserve
much of the rhetoric, few commitments on the necessary infrastructure for
the region are anticipated.

FT  12 MAR 93 / PowerGen grants pay deal of up to 5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the most generous awards of the current pay round has been granted at
PowerGen, the electricity generator, where the 5,500 workers will receive
annual rises ranging from 4 per cent to 5 per cent - well above the
inflation rate of 1.7 per cent, David Goodhart writes.
This contrasts with far less generous deals at some regional electricity
companies in England and Wales. At Eastern Electricity, pay has been frozen
and the working week raised from 37 hours to 40 hours. At National Power,
PowerGen's larger rival, workers received 3.9 per cent over 15 months from
October but also agreed to accept a performance pay system next year.
The PowerGen deal, the first since the introduction of 'single-table'
bargaining with the unions for all the main groups of workers, provides a
2.5 per cent increase on basic rates with additional lump-sum payments
ranging from Pounds 250 to Pounds 550. Mr Jim Mowatt, chief union
negotiator, said the deal would be recommended by the unions.
The government, which has set a limit on increases in public-sector pay
bills of 1.5 per cent, still owns 40 per cent of PowerGen.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Service sector surplus declines to Pounds 594m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE service sector produced the lowest surplus on its overseas trade for
almost 11 years in the fourth quarter of last year, official figures
indicated yesterday.
The surplus on services was Pounds 594m compared with Pounds 892m in the
third quarter and Pounds 1.05bn in the same quarter a year earlier.
However, the overall invisibles surplus, which includes government
transfers, interest payments, profits and dividends as well as services, was
revised up to Pounds 794m in the fourth quarter from an initial estimate of
Pounds 600m.
This meant that last year's shortfall on the current account, which gives
the UK's balance of trade in goods and invisibles, was Pounds 11.9bn
compared with a shortfall of Pounds 6.38bn in 1991.
The figures from the Central Statistical Office show that the UK's surplus
on invisibles remains on an upwards trend. This is mainly because of the
improving balance on interest, profits and dividends resulting from lower UK
interest rates and the devalued pound.
Interest, profits and dividends showed a surplus of Pounds 1.23bn in the
fourth quarter compared with Pounds 1.61bn in the third quarter but only
Pounds 160m in the second. The better surpluses of the second half of last
year reflected the fact that sterling's drop has boosted net earnings on
direct investment by increasing the sterling value of money earned overseas.
Net earnings were also helped by recovery in the US.
Lower UK base rates meant that banks' net interest payments abroad were
lower than in the first half of the year.
The disappointing surplus on services in the fourth quarter was partly due
to large outflows of insurance payments from the UK following Hurricane
Andrew in the US. The surplus on services for the year as a whole was Pounds
3.7bn, the lowest annual surplus since 1980.
Earnings by UK residents on portfolio investment abroad were Pounds 3.27bn
in the fourth quarter, the highest figure on record. The CSO said this
reflected greater investment in bonds, which have a higher rate of return
than equities.
The deficit on government transfers was Pounds 1.01bn in the fourth quarter.
For the year as a whole the deficit was Pounds 5.1bn, significantly higher
than in the previous year when payments to the UK for its contribution in
the Gulf war reduced the deficit to Pounds 1.34bn.
Overseas authorities invested Pounds 1.29bn in gilts last year, although in
the fourth quarter they disinvested in gilts by Pounds 158m. Private
investors bought Pounds 33m of gilts in the fourth quarter and Pounds 1.03bn
in the year as a whole.

FT  12 MAR 93 / 'Two-tier' fund market identified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TWO-TIER market in fund management is emerging in the UK, with four
leading groups on average outperforming the rest of the industry, according
to Mr John Clamp, chief executive of Combined Actuarial Performance
Services, an organisation that measures the performance of pension funds.
The four leaders since 1988 have been Gartmore, Mercury Asset Management,
Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management and Schroders. At the same time these four
are taking the lion's share of funds being moved under the guidance of
consultants. Data show that they have significantly outperformed the median
return of all UK fund managers since 1988, Mr Clamp said.
The so-called Group of Four earned a total return on UK equities of 23.3 per
cent compared with the industry median of 22.4 per cent last year. The
industry overall outperformed the FT-A All Share Index by 1.8 per cent in
1992.
Between 1988 and 1992, the Group of Four earned an average return on UK
equities of 16 per cent against an industry average of 14.9 per cent.
'We have probably had a two-tiered market for the past two or three years,'
Mr Clamp said.
However, he thinks it unlikely that the same four groups will stay in the
top tier. He said that while some can outperform for a period of years, data
show that no group has been able to outperform consistently for a long time.
Explaining the outperformance last year, Mr Clamp noted that, on average,
fund managers had underperformed in earlier years and that on average over
the past 10 years, fund managers have exactly equalled the returns of the
FT-A index.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Oftel criticised on BT link fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFTEL, the telecommunications watchdog, is criticised today for failing to
establish fair terms for operators that are either connected to British
Telecommunications' network, or wish to be linked.
The National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, says in its
first report on Oftel that its failure to establish fair terms is hampering
competition.
The office says Mercury Communications, BT's main competitor, and new
entrants to the market have complained that BT's interconnection charges,
which are determined by Oftel, are too high. Interconnection charges are
estimated to be worth more than Pounds 400m a year to BT.
Oftel is re-examining the interconnection agreement between Mercury and BT
and is expected to deliver its verdict soon. It is also exploring options
for accounting separation between different parts of BT's activities. The
aim would be to ensure that there is greater transparency of interconnection
charges and that BT charges itself on the same basis as its competitors.
The office says Oftel has had some success in using its pricing formula to
reduce the real cost of some telephone services. But these reductions have
largely benefited high-volume business customers rather than residential
customers.
A survey by the office of some of the 41,000 people who made representations
to Oftel in 1991 found a high level of dissatisfaction with the way BT had
dealt with their initial complaints. It also highlighted delays by Oftel in
processing complaints and the poor quality of the final explanation of the
outcome of cases.
The office says Oftel should use new powers under the 1992 Competition and
Service (Utilities) Act to seek consistency between operators' service
standards.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Ban on Scots rail funding is lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRATHCLYDE Regional Council, which subsidises the railway network in the
greater Glasgow area, has lifted its ban on a Pounds 52m investment
programme in new trains and tracks.
It imposed the ban when the government announced last month that rail
services in Scotland were to be franchised.
Mr Malcolm Waugh, chairman of the council's transport committee, said he had
received written assurances from Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister,
that the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive would be directly
involved in awarding franchise contracts and would be able to specify
service levels and fares on services which the council supports.
The council had suspended the investment programme because of uncertainty
over its future under the franchising arrangements for British Rail.
Strathclyde, like other passenger transport executives, makes decisions
about rail services in its area while BR operates the trains.
Mr Waugh said he had been concerned that rolling stock funded by the council
would be used elsewhere by the franchisee.
He had also been worried that off-peak services would be withdrawn without
reference to the council, which pays the passenger transport executive a
subsidy of Pounds 30m a year.

FT  12 MAR 93 / PowerGen agrees 4-5% pay deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most generous awards of the current pay round has been granted at
PowerGen, the electricity generator, where the 5,500 workers will receive
annual rises ranging from 4 per cent to 5 per cent, well above the inflation
rate of 1.7 per cent.
This contrasts with far less generous deals at some of the regional
electricity companies in England and Wales. At Eastern Electricity, for
example, pay has been frozen and the working week has been increased from 37
hours to 40 hours.
At Southern Electricity a pay rise of 2.9 per cent plus a Pounds 200 lump
sum was awarded, but in exchange for a radical flexibility deal on working
time including 12-hour working days and regular Saturday work.
At National Power, PowerGen's larger rival, workers received 3.9 per cent
over 15 months from October but also agreed to accept a performance pay
system next year.
The PowerGen deal, the first since the introduction of 'single table'
bargaining with the unions for all the main groups of workers at the
company, provides a 2.5 per cent increase on basic rates with additional
lump sum payments ranging from Pounds 250 to Pounds 550.
Mr Jim Mowatt, chief union negotiator, said the deal would be recommended by
the unions.
It appears that Power-Gen was keen to pay as much as possible in a lump sum
so that next year, when trading conditions are likely to be harder, pay
scales will not have been raised to a much higher level.
The government, which has set a limit on public-sector pay bills of 1.5 per
cent, still owns 40 per cent of PowerGen.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Sales rise seen by 46% of retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOPS selling chemists' goods, furniture and shoes benefited last month from
more buoyant trading, according to the Confederation of British Industry's
monthly distributive trades survey.
While 46 per cent of retailers polled registered an increase in sales
volumes last month compared with February last year, 27 per cent saw sales
fall.
The 19 per cent balance which experienced increased sales was the highest
since last April. A further pick-up in sales volumes across the sector is
expected this month.
The report, published yesterday, indicates that big stores with more than
500 employees are performing better than smaller shops, possibly because
they have been quicker to drop prices to attract more customers.
Even though the retail sector registered a year-on-year increase in sales
volumes in February for the second month running, the sector still considers
sales to be lower than normal.
The survey polled 474 retailers, wholesalers and motor traders between
February 17 and March 3.
Among different parts of the retail trade, chemists' shops performed
particularly well in February, continuing the trend of strong year-on-year
sales growth during 1992.
The balance of chemists' shops reporting an increase in sales last month -
compared with February last year - was 48 per cent, the same figure as for
stores selling furniture and carpets.
Grocers also saw healthy sales increases last month while off-licences,
specialist food shops and booksellers registered sales declines.

THE NATIONAL Federation of Fishermen's Organisations is holding an emergency
meeting today on the crisis over fish imports. Fishermen and dock workers at
Grimsby last night mounted a 24-hour blockade to prevent cheap Russian and
Norwegian fish arriving.
The federation has written to Russian and Norwegian fishing organisations
threatening a full-scale land and sea blockade of British ports if the
imports do not stop.
In the last few days, cargoes of Russian and French fish have been turned
back or destroyed at ports around Britain.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Brewers warn of price rise on beer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BREWERS and beer drinkers across the country are urging the government to
drop a regulation - set to be enforced in April next year - that may spell
the end for the head on a pint of beer. The Brewers Society said that
abiding by the regulations might add 6p to the price of a pint.
Section 43 of the Weights and Measures Act requires a pint to be entirely
liquid - with no froth. But almost nobody outside Whitehall appears to want
the new regulation. There were only 23 formal complaints about short measure
throughout the country in 1991 - one for every 256m pints served.
The Campaign for Real Ale thinks that better training for bar staff and a
bit of common sense would ensure that customers were satisfied.
The society says the changes would mean ending the use of brim measure
glasses and adds that the re-equipment of every bar with line-measure
glasses would cost Pounds 19m.
Alternatively, the change could mean replacing bar pumps with a metered
dispensing system. If only 10 per cent of bars were converted, the society
estimates, it would cost Pounds 13.5m.
The society is asking the Department of Trade and Industry to reconsider by
examining the prime minister's deregulation initiative. This calls for a
review of rules that impose costs on industry out of all proportion to the
problems they are meant to solve.

NISSAN Motor will form a joint venture with Zhengzhou Light Truck Factory of
Henan province in central China to manufacture and market pick-up trucks in
China, Nissan said, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The new company, to be called Zhengzhou Nissan Automobile, will produce the
Nissan pick-up truck (double cab type), which can be used as either a
passenger or commercial vehicle.
Production should start in early 1994 at a rate of 5,000 units per year,
rising to 30,000 units per year by 1997, Nissan said. The new company will
also take over production of three-tonne trucks now produced by Zhengzhou
Light Truck Factory.
Zhengzhou Nissan will be capitalised at 250m yuan (Pounds 30m), with 35 per
cent from Zhengzhou Light Truck Factory, 5 per cent from Nissan, 25 per cent
from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, 25 per cent from Thailand's
Sammitra Motors Group and 10 per cent from China International Trust and
Investment Corp, the statement said.

FT  12 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC penalises bicycle imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission has taken action to protect Community bicycle-makers
from 'unfair' Chinese competition.
Chinese bicycle-makers - in terms of market penetration, probably the most
successful vehicle manufacturers in the world - have allegedly been
'dumping' bicycles on the EC market at unfairly low prices.
The Commission yesterday agreed to impose provisional anti-dumping duties on
Chinese bicycles imported into the Community. The duties will be set at 34.4
per cent of the net price before customs clearance.
Manufacturers from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Britain
complained in 1991 that they were not increasing sales in the growing
Community market because Chinese imports were undercutting EC products by an
average of 44 per cent.
Between 1989 and 1991, annual EC bicycle purchases increased 32 per cent to
19.9m, but Community manufacturers' share of the Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.47bn)
market dropped from 33 per cent to 27 per cent.
Meanwhile, imports of Chinese bicycles - from 'sit-up-and-beg' tourers to
racers and mountain bikes - more than tripled, from 693,600 to 2.1m. Chinese
manufacturers' market share rose from 4.6 per cent to 10.5 per cent.
'The pressure from Chinese exporters on the price of bicycles sold in the
Community has eroded EC industry's profitability and undermined its
investments,' said the Commission yesterday.
It has decided not to take any action against imports of bicycles from
Taiwan, after a parallel inquiry discovered that the dumping margin was
negligible.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE semiconductor users have complained that US manufacturers have been
cancelling supply contracts because of a shortage of semiconductors in the
US.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister at the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, said that Japanese semiconductor users had protested to an
industry body. If the complaint turned out to be true, Japan would ask the
US to take action at the bilateral meeting in Hawaii next week to review
results of their agreement on opening the Japanese market to foreign
suppliers.
The US claims that the semiconductor agreement between the two countries
calls for a foreign market share of 20 per cent, while the Japanese insist
that the 20 per cent figure was just a US industry expectation and not a
Japanese guarantee.
The slowdown in the Japanese economy means that the 20 per cent target is
unlikely to be met. Japan has been working hard to meet US criticism by
publicising its efforts to buy foreign semiconductors and clarifying why it
thinks foreign market share has not risen as much as the US would like.
In an attempt to indicate the Japanese commitment to increasing foreign
market share, Miti, for example, recently asked Japanese semiconductor users
to make further efforts to buy from abroad even though the deadline for the
20 per cent target was the end of last year.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of the US Congress approving the North American Free Trade
Agreement dimmed yesterday when Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority
leader, warned that he would not support the pact 'on a leap of faith.'
In emotional testimony about what he called shocking living and working
conditions he had seen on several trips to Mexican companies, he said Nafta
had to provide for enforcement of labour and environmental laws.
His testimony to the House trade committee followed that of Mr Mickey
Kantor, US Trade Representative, who vowed not to send the agreement to
Congress unless he first negotiated supplemental agreements with Mexico and
Canada to raise environmental and labour standards throughout the continent.
With negotiations on the side agreements due to begin next Wednesday, Mr
Kantor told the House trade subcommittee of his proposal for two trilateral
commissions on labour and environment. These would analyse issues, review
complaints, request information from government agencies and report publicly
on government enforcement.
Mr Kantor also is seeking another approach. Mexico has already agreed to
alter its court system to provide for judicial review of administrative
decisions for the enforcement of intellectual property rights. 'We will
review these provisions to assess their applicability for environmental and
labour issues,' he said.
Mr Kantor was warned by congressmen that the Nafta faces certain defeat
unless the concerns of labour and environment are met and industry comes
forward to lobby strongly for the pact.

FT  12 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Republicans demand US dumping study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Republican members of the US International Trade Commission are
demanding that the Democratic chairman start a controversial study of the US
dumping and subsidy laws, requested by Mrs Carla Hills, former US Trade
Representative.
The study was delayed for at least 90 days by Mr Don Newquist, ITC chairman,
who referred it to Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US Trade Representative. Mr
Newquist said he would cancel the study if Mr Kantor asked him to do so.
The two Republicans - Commissioners Anne Brunsdale and Carol Crawford -
stated jointly that Mr Newquest's 'unilateral decision to withdraw the
action request (for the study) is beyond your power as chairman.'
The ITC has six members - three Republicans and three Democrats. The
chairmanship, which alternates between the parties, is appointed for two
years by the US president.
The proposed study on the impact of dumping and subsidies, and on the laws
which govern them, is very controversial, particularly in Congress where the
'fair trade' laws are seen as the last defence against predatory dumping by
subsidised producers.
But many exporters complain that they are being harmed, by the higher costs
that result from the duties and by the dumping and countervailing duties
laws of other nations, which is why Mrs Hills ordered the study before she
left office in January.
Mrs Paula Stern, a former ITC chairman and adviser to President Bill
Clinton, said studies such as these from an independent agency had been
invaluable in the past.
'Different interests will try to influence the outcome but an independent
agency should be able to sort through the different voices on all sides and
come through with a document that can be helpful,' she said.
Mrs Brunsdale, a former ITC chairman, said in a statement of her own that
withdrawal of a study from the Commission's agenda had always been by
consensus, in 'an informal, collegial process.' The chairman's explanation
that he was concerned about the commitment of agency resources to the study
was 'both specious and irrelevant to the issue at hand,' she said.
The resources involved are the ITC staff, which must be paid whether or not
the investigation goes forward. 'These investigations are mandatory,' she
said. 'We do not have a choice of whether to devote resources to them.'
Despite the commissioners' objections, the ITC chairman seems to be able to
act unless a majority of the commission - four of the six members - tell him
he cannot. But his action in stalling the study, even temporarily, has
caused turmoil in the commission.
'Our agency has always prided itself on being non-partisan, ready to serve
Republican and Democrat, President and Congress,' said Ms Crawford. 'We risk
undermining our ability to serve the government, and violating our legal
obligations, if we take it upon ourselves to decide which requests, from
which Congresses or which administrations, we are going to honour.'

FT  12 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC credit transfer delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is growing impatience among officials that controversial European
Commission proposals to transfer short-term export credit activities from
government agencies to private hands are still bogged down after four months
of wrangling over which directorate should handle the issue.
After discussions between Mr Karel Van Miert, the new commissioner for
competition policy, and his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, now external
relations commissioner, it seems officials would prefer the competition
directorate (DG4) to take up the running.
But Mr Van Miert said yesterday that pressures to deal with issues like
steel and coal had prevented him from 'dealing with the dossier'.
Plans to put short-term export credit insurance for marketable risks into
the hands of private insurers were begun by the external affairs directorate
(DG1) at the beginning of 1992. They arose following a two-year study on
harmonising national export credit policies before creation of the single
market.
Challenging deep-rooted national vested interests dedicated to ensuring
maximum government support for exporters, they were likely to result in
higher insurance premiums, and aroused reinsurance worries for insurers.
Matters became muddled in the middle of last year, when Sir Leon concluded
that the activities of government agencies in providing commercial credit
risk insurance left private sector competitors at an unfair disadvantage. As
such, export credits were a matter for DG4 not DG1.
Officials in DG4 calculated that EC members spend Ecu3.24bn (Pounds 2.7bn) a
year supporting their exporters.

BANGKOK Transit System Corporation, which has a 30-year concession to build
and run an Dollars 880m (Pounds 619.70m) elevated railway for Thailand's
heavily congested capital city, yesterday short-listed five international
consortiums and invited them to bid for construction work and supply of the
complete rail system.
BTSC, a subsidiary of the Tanayong property group, said it had rejected
approaches from six more consortiums.
The five chosen applicants are expected to submit tenders for the whole
project on a turnkey basis by June 30.
Construction should start in the third quarter of this year.
Bidders will have to submit financing proposals as part of the tender.
'Based on discussions with intended bidders and export credit agencies, it
would appear that supplier and export credits on favourable terms, for up to
85 per cent of contract values, could be available,' Salomon Brothers, one
of BTSC's financial advisors, said in a statement.
BTSC said the five consortiums invited to bid for the project are:
Siemens and Christiani and Nielsen; GEC Alsthom, Italian-Thai Development
and Bouygues; Mitsui, Sumitomo, GTM, Siam Syntech and Delta Engineering;
Itochu, AEG Westinghouse, Sumitomo Construction, Nishimatsu and Maeda; and
ABB Traction, Costain, Kier, Konoike and Thai Konoike.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Japan ponders shift in business ties: Changing relationships
brought about by the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEB of long-term relationships upon which Japan's industrial success has
been built may be starting to unravel.
Large companies offer lifetime employment to their full-time workers. They
forge close relationships with a pyramid of loyal sub-contractors and depend
upon the patient, intimate involvement of banks to fund their long-term
investment plans. Corporate relationships are underpinned by cross
shareholdings between companies.
These links are widely credited with creating a long-term outlook at
Japanese companies which helps them to ride out sharp cyclical swings in
economic activity.
However, the downturn which began last year is proving so severe that these
relationships are being recast in ways which will change the character of
the Japanese economy.
Suppliers. Manufacturers are rethinking their relationships with
sub-contractors as they cut costs to stave off a fourth year of declining
profits. It is not simply that manufacturers are demanding steep cuts in
component prices. They are rationalising and diversifying.
Most car manufacturers plan to cut the number of parts they use and the
variety of models they make by between 30 and 40 per cent. Fewer parts will
probably mean fewer suppliers.
Some of these suppliers will be highly privileged business partners.
According to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti),
manufacturers are strengthening their ties to key sub-contractors which have
high technology.
However competition is likely to intensify among suppliers of commodity
items. Manufacturers are likely to change these suppliers more frequently,
forcing sub-contractors to seek to supply a wider range of customers.
A recent Miti survey found the proportion of sub-contractors dealing with
less than five customers is expected to fall from 70 per cent in 1987 to
about 51 per cent within five years.
Workers. The famed lifetime employment system, is starting to fray at the
edges as companies cut personnel costs.
The terms of the lifetime employment contract are being amended. Workers
over the age of 50 are increasingly likely to be encouraged to retire early,
foregoing some of their peak earnings late in their careers.
Banks. The 1980s wrought a fundamental change in the relationship between
Japanese companies and their banks which could have important implications
for their response to the downturn.
In 1931 only about 10 per cent of funds supplied to industry came from
banks. In the three decades following the war, when Japanese industry was
growing most rapidly, banks accounted for about 87.5 per cent of industrial
investment.
In the 1980s manufacturers increasingly turned away from banking
relationships to the capital markets for funds.
The Bank of Japan says large manufacturing companies used bonds and equity
for about 52 per cent of the finance they raised in 1989, up from 27.5 per
cent in 1980. Long-term bank borrowing fell from 13 to just 4 per cent. In
the 1970s manufacturers accounted for about 50 per cent of bank lending. In
1990 it was 16 per cent.
Banking relationships became less stable. Between 1984 and 1989 a fifth of
large Japanese companies changed their main bank for short-term borrowing,
up from 5 per cent between 1980 and 1984.
The Bank of Japan concludes that weakening relationships significantly
loosened the financial discipline of industrial companies. As a result, the
companies invested so heavily in the late 1980s that most now carry heavy
depreciation charges for past investment which has merely created
overcapacity.
Although the Tokyo stock market is deeply depressed, with few issues of new
equity, it is unlikely that old banking relationships will be reformed.
Corporate liquidity is being run down as profits head for their fourth
consecutive year of decline next year.
Cross-shareholdings. In their search to ease financial pressures, companies
will have to consider breaking other relationships - traditional
cross-shareholdings which cement the links between companies. Selling
securities is one of the favourite methods companies use to boost their
profits.
Companies hold shares in one another partly to cement business
relationships. In the 1980s boom when the stock market soared they also had
the incentive of large capital gains to encourage them.
Yet corporations can no longer rely on these shareholdings, according to Mr
Jiro Ushio, chairman of Ushio, the lamp manufacturer and a leading member of
the Association of Business Executives. As he puts it: 'With share prices in
a freeze, businesses can no longer count on stable shareholdings by friendly
banks and business associates.
'Increasing shareholdings was not just a gesture of mutual support but an
economically sensible investment because companies wanted capital gains,' he
says. 'The stock market depression jeopardises the cross shareholding
practice.'
Many of the main customs and practices of the Japanese economy, such as
lifetime employment and close relationships between banks and manufacturers,
were created around the time of the second world war. Their character is not
fixed in stone.
In the next few years the traditional long-term, stable, hierarchical
relationships will probably be confined to a tighter-knit group of select
banks, workers, sub-contractors and shareholdings.
For the rest, life will become more volatile, short-term, fluid and
uncertain.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Australia's jobless increase boosts opposition hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE in the rate of unemployment yesterday boosted the conservative
opposition's hopes of victory in tomorrow's Australian federal election.
The independent government statistical service said seasonally adjusted
unemployment rose to 11.1 per cent in February, after falling from 11.3 per
cent to 11 per cent in January.
The conservative Liberal/National party coalition believes the unemployment
figures will prompt a last-minute drift of support away from the Labor
government, which has been in power for 10 years.
The opposition needs a uniform national swing of 0.9 per cent to capture the
five government seats it needs to take power in the 147-seat House of
Representatives.
The latest batch of opinion polls, taken before the release of the
unemployment figures, put the two parties virtually equal following a steady
rise in Labor support in the last week.
A boost for the government came when Labor was endorsed by the main
environmental groups.
Support from environmental organisations was crucial in the last election in
1990, when Labor won fewer first-choice votes than the coalition, but was
elected after the distribution of preferences, the system under which second
and subsequent preference votes are counted if no candidate wins more than
50 per cent of first choice votes.
However, the polls also showed significant variations around the country,
indicating that the outcome is likely to depend on the results in about 20
marginal seats.
Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, tried to blunt the impact of the latest
unemployment figures by painting an upbeat picture of the economy in his
last big speech of the campaign at the National Press Club in Canberra.
Mr Keating said unemployment was 'the one big negative fact of our national
life', but claimed recent encouraging figures for retail sales and exports
showed economic growth was accelerating.
Most of his speech was taken up with further attacks on the opposition's
proposal to implement a wide-ranging goods and services tax (GST).

FT  12 MAR 93 / Indian stock market denies flouting rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW has erupted between the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest stock
market, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the securities
watchdog, over the board's recent first-ever inspection of stockbrokers'
books.
The Sebi has accused stockbrokers of flouting the exchange's rules,
including regulations on margin trading designed to limit the risk of
members defaulting through excessive speculative investments.
It has also accused the exchange authorities of failing to enforce rules and
of poor administration.
The stock exchange denied the allegations, saying they were 'baseless, made
out of context and blown out of proportion.'
The argument will do nothing to restore investors' faith in the stock market
where, as measured by the Bombay stock exchange's 30-share index, shares
have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early last year, including a 320
points fall since the government's budget was announced two weeks ago.
Yesterday the index closed at 2330. Foreign investors, who are being wooed
by India as a source of much-needed capital, will also be concerned at the
latest allegations of poor management at the exchange.
In one of its most damaging passages, the inspectors' report alleges that D
S Prabhoodas, a leading firm headed by Mr Hemendra Kothari, a former BSE
president, and by Mr Jaswant Chotalal, a member of the BSE's governing body,
avoided margin payments totalling Rs185.4m (Pounds 4.08m).
Mr Kothari said yesterday that most of the transactions covered by the
report were off-exchange deals directly between financial institutions for
which margin payments were not required. Mr M R Mayya, the BSE's executive
director, said BSE rules permitted such bilateral off-exchange transactions.
Sebi also accused the exchange of mismanaging the administration of its
building.
This week's argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which began
almost as soon as Sebi started operations a year ago. It was established by
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, as a crucial element in financial
reform.
Brokers claim the Sebi is heavy-handed and fails to understand their needs.
They say rules must be applied flexibly and many firms are extremely small
and unable to carry the cost of extra regulations.
But the finance minister is backing Sebi to the hilt and singled it out for
praise in his recent budget speech.
Finance ministry officials believe loose regulations allow brokers and
others to dodge taxes and also contributed to last year's securities market
scandal in which banks, including the UK's Standard Chartered Bank, lost a
combined gross total of Rs40bn.

CAMBODIAN gunmen killed at least 34 Vietnamese settlers in an attack on a

factions signed a peace accord in 1991, the United Nations announced
yesterday, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok
The extremist Khmer Rouge guerrilla group, which has campaigned vociferously
against the presence of the Vietnamese in Cambodia, was immediately
suspected of the killings at a lakeside village of houseboats, near Siem
Reap, in Cambodia's north west.
The massacre is another setback for the United Nations Transitional
Authority in Cambodia's attempts to hold a general election in May. Even
before the latest atrocity, its head, Mr Yasushi Akashi, had said conditions
were not yet suitable for an election.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and China's month-long contest over the terms of Hong Kong talks
reaches its climax today when Governor Chris Patten addresses the
Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's law-making body.
Late last night Mr Patten told China that he will today publish legislation,
which provides for greater democracy in the colony, unless Beijing has
agreed to negotiations without preconditions.
Mr Patten was prepared yesterday to announce publication of the bill, but
two hours before he was due to do so China indicated a softening of its
position sufficient for him to stay his hand another 24 hours. He cancelled
a planned address to LegCo.
The the day's developments were mirrored in the performance of the Hong Kong
stock market. The Hang Seng Index, the market's indicator of the performance
of blue chip stocks, fell by nearly 190 points when news of Mr Patten's
decision to publish his bill swept the market. It recovered to end the day
116.62 lower at 6,371.84 when he postponed his appearance before LegCo.
The expectation in Hong Kong last night was that China would drop its
outstanding demands and that Mr Patten would be able to announce talks
today. Both sides were, however, engaged in brinkmanship of a high order.
Mr Patten has given himself maximum room to manoeuvre. He has ordered that
the publication of the entire Hong Kong government gazette be delayed until
he speaks to LegCo. If China has not committed itself to talks by then he is
expected to gazette the bill.
Britain and China agreed nearly two weeks ago to the principles upon which
their talks would be based. Since then, China has attempted to determine the
membership of Britain's negotiating team and refused to set a date for
talks.
On Tuesday, Mr Ma Yuzhen, China's ambassador in London, was called to the
Foreign Office and told that Mr Patten would announce publication of his
bill yesterday if Beijing had not dropped these conditions to talks. China
replied early yesterday afternoon, indicating that talks could begin this
month, although no precise date was indicated. It is also understood that
Beijing was still arguing about the way in which Hong Kong government
officials would be described in the communique the two sides were drafting.

FT  12 MAR 93 / UK presses Israel over Palestinian deportees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL efforts to find a formula which would allow a full resumption
of Middle East peace negotiations intensified yesterday ahead of Monday's
meeting in Washington between President Bill Clinton and Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel's prime minister.
Britain again pressed Israel to find a solution to the issue of Palestinian
deportations which is the main obstacle to the four Arab delegations
accepting the American invitation to resume negotiations on April 20.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, told Mr Yossi Beilin,
Israel's deputy foreign minister, that progress had to be made on bringing
home the nearly 400 Palestinians deported in December to southern Lebanon.
Britain also supports the minimum Palestinian demand that Israel should
commit itself not to engage in future mass deportations.
Mr Beilin said before meeting Mr Hurd that he did not consider this to be a
'serious or tangible demand, and therefore I do not think that we need to
answer it'.
He added that it was neither feasible, nor realistic, for Israel to vow that
it would never resort to deportations again.
The present Labour government had raised the flag of territorial compromise,
said Mr Beilin, unlike the previous Likud administration which had only
wanted to annex the occupied territories.
The Palestinians should recognise this and understand that there was no
other option for them but to return to the negotiating table.
Whether Israel is willing to provide some assurance on the deportation issue
may become clearer after Mr Rabin's meeting with Mr Clinton next week.
The US supported UN Security Council Resolution 799 demanding the return of
the deported Palestinians and subsequently pressured Israel into agreeing to
take back 100 of the men immediately.
If Mr Rabin is to soften his stance further it would most likely be
presented in the form of a goodwill gesture to the new US administration.
Syria, which has stressed its desire to get back to the negotiating table,
worked on new ideas with Egypt yesterday for ending the impasse.
Mr Farouk al-Shara held talks with President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo and said
afterwards that they had specific proposals for the return of the deportees
and for preventing similar action in future.

FT  12 MAR 93 / West urged to intervene more in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN countries should consider stepping up their intervention in Iraq by
barring the Baghdad regime from deploying heavy weaponry in the south of the
country, a senior Iranian leader has suggested.
Dr Hassan Rowhani, secretary-general of the National Security Council,
Iran's top foreign policy body, said the 'no-fly zone' imposed by the US,
Britain and France over southern Iraq would help protect the region's
inhabitants from the forces of President Saddam Hussein only if supplemented
by a ban on heavy weapons similar to that already imposed in the Kurdish
region to the north. He was speaking to journalists on Wednesday night
during a private visit to London.
Dr Rowhani's comments indicate that the Iranian leadership is closely
monitoring western policy towards Iraq from the sidelines, in the hope that
external pressure will eventually topple Mr Saddam's regime. He said the
west had missed an opportunity to do so immediately after the 1991 Gulf war,
when Shia Moslems in the south and Kurds in the north rose up against their
ruler. Mr Saddam's survival, he added, presented the west with 'a difficult
dilemma - and it has not decided what to do.'
Dr Rowhani played down western fears that removing a strong central
government in Baghdad could lead to Iraq's partition along ethnic and
sectarian lines.
Instead, he said, negotiating a secure future for the people of Iraq was one
of many regional issues on which the west shared common interests with Iran,
if only countries such as the US and Britain could overcome differences with
the Islamic republic.

GENERAL Try Sutrisno was elected vice-president of Indonesia yesterday by
the People's Consultative Assembly, writes William Keeling in Jakarta.
General Sutrisno, who retired as head of the armed forces last month, was
the only candidate, just as President Suharto had been a day earlier when
elected for his sixth five-year term of office.
The general now becomes the favourite candidate to succeed 71-year-old Mr
Suharto.
Gen Sutrisno could provide a counter-balance to Mr Suharto. Diplomats say
relations between the two men cooled following a massacre by soldiers in
1991 of civilians attending the funeral of a pro-separatist activist in the
disputed territory of East Timor. Gen Sutrisno vociferously defended the
military's actions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two Japanese companies yesterday announced job cuts totalling 4,000 as the
government prepared to release economic growth figures for the final quarter
of last year which are expected to be the worst in nearly two decades, write
Michiyo Nakamoto and Charles Leadbeater.
Kyocera, Japan's leading bioceramics manufacturer, plans to cut its
workforce by about 1,000 to 13,000 within two years, while Sumitomo Metal
Industries plans a reduction of 3,000 to 22,000 by 1996.
The companies' announcements come amid the worst deterioration in corporate
profits since the oil shocks of 1975.
A survey of more than 22,000 companies released yesterday by the finance
ministry found that average pre-tax profits fell by 39.4 per cent in the
final quarter of last year, the 10th consecutive quarterly drop and the
steepest fall since the first quarter of 1975.
The figures for gross national product to be published today are widely
expected to show that the Japanese economy contracted by about 1 per cent,
the worst since 1974 when GNP fell 0.8 per cent.
Meanwhile a survey of more than 4,000 employers by the labour ministry found
that 39 per cent had cut labour costs in the final months of last year. The
most popular measures were cuts in overtime.
However the measures announced recently confirm than Japanese industry is
embarked on a round of much deeper cost cutting to arrest the protracted
decline in profitability.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Pakistan expects Dollars 1.45bn package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN expects to obtain a financing package totalling Dollars 1.45bn
(Pounds 1.02bn) following discussions with the International Monetary Fund,
Mr Sartaj Aziz, finance minister, said in London yesterday.
He predicted agreement by June on a Dollars 1bn IMF facility, which would be
accompanied by a Dollars 250m World Bank loan to support public sector
reform, and Dollars 200m of co-financing from Japan.
A central element would be Pakistan's plans to tackle the budget deficit,
its most pressing economic problem. Mr Aziz has insisted that the deficit
cannot be reduced quickly as this would curb economic growth unacceptably.
He expects the IMF to agree to a target of 5 1/2 per cent of GDP for the
fiscal year beginning July 1993. The outcome for this financial year is
likely to be 7 per cent compared with a previous target of 5 per cent.
Pakistan faces large structural problems in reducing the deficit, with some
60 per cent of spending taken by defence and debt service, and more than 50
per cent of revenues coming from import tariffs.
Mr Aziz plans further gradual reductions in tariff rates as part of his
programme to reform and open up the economy. Revenue will be made up by
broader application of consumption taxes and more effective collection of
direct taxes.
He admitted it was taking time for liberalisation to attract foreign
investment in export-oriented industries. But there was encouraging
expansion by well-established foreign companies and investment in
small-scale industry by expatriate Pakistanis.
Attempts to Islamicise the financial system, which have contributed to
foreigners' hesitancy, should be resolved this year by the supreme court, Mr
Aziz said. The government is seeking exceptions to a ban on interest
payments so that inflation can be taken into account and to facilitate
government borrowing and transactions with foreigners.
The IMF loan would be a three-year enhanced structural adjustment facility,
Pakistan's first new IMF funding since 1988. The World Bank loan would
support reform and a cut in the size of the public sector, already being
reduced through rapid privatisation.
Inflation this year is expected to be around 10 per cent compared with an 8
per cent target, Mr Aziz said.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration plans a Dollars 19.5bn package of job retraining
programmes, technology investment and economic development incentives over
the next five years, to help companies and communities convert from defence
to the civilian economy.
President Bill Clinton launched the plan, which in part bundles together
existing programmes, in a speech to workers at a defence company in
Maryland, but the announcement was also geared to help soften the impact
today of the Defence Department's list of military bases which it wants to
close.
Mr Clinton said the impact of cuts in defence spending could be eased if the
country were to act decisively and intelligently. 'Clearly, defence
conversion can be done, and can be done well, making change our friend and
not our enemy,' he said.
But members of Congress - especially those from California and South
Carolina, which are expected to be hit particularly hard by the base
closures to be announced today - complained that the measures would only
ease a small part of their pain.
Mr Clinton said the government wanted to promote dual-use research and
civilian use of technology developed for military purposes.
Mr Gene Sperling, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy,
said the defence conversion programme was 'a major sea change in economic
policy'.
A total of Dollars 1.7bn will be spent this year on defence conversion, Mr
Sperling said, most of it money already allotted to the task by Congress
last year, but which the Bush administration had not spent.
Mr Sperling said the president believed that, 'from soldiers to scientists,
it is morally right and economically right that we seek to redirect the
energies and talents of the people who were responsible for winning the cold
war to the new investments in the economy that we need for national economic
security.'
The administration estimates that about 1m uniformed and civilian defence
personnel will lose their jobs because of defence cuts, along with another
1m civilians working in private sector defence companies.
Retail sales rose in February by a modest 0.3 per cent compared with the
previous month, according to Commerce Department figures. The department
also revised down its original estimates for January, from an improvement of
0.3 per cent to no change from December, when sales had jumped by 1.1 per
cent.
Last month, durable goods sales fell by 0.5 per cent, largely because of
weak demand for cars and light trucks. Non-durable sales went up by 0.7 per
cent, led by strong performances at grocery stores and petrol stations.

A United Nations relief mission in former Yugoslavia ran into trouble
yesterday when hundreds of angry Moslems held British troops and their
armoured vehicles hostage in a besieged Bosnian town, Reuter reports from
Sarajevo.
The British-escorted convoy had gone to Konjevic Polje in eastern Bosnia, to
try and evacuate 75 people injured in fighting between Serb and Moslem
forces in the area.
Mr Jan Erik Linstad of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
said after fleeing the settlement that according to the British convoy
commander, Major Alan Abraham, and four soldiers in two armoured cars had
been surrounded 'by a living wall of hundreds of Moslems climbing all over
the vehicles.'
The British military said the villagers had set fire to bales of hay in
order to block the escape of the vehicles. But while the British soldiers
had been unable to move, they had not felt intimidated.
There was no indication of how long the British were likely to stay cooped
up in Konjevic Polje, where shelling was reported.
A British soldier was being flown back to Britain for urgent medical
treatment in a very serious condition after being wounded by a mine in
Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday, the ministry said.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's cabinet was completed yesterday when the Senate
unanimously approved the nomination of Ms Janet Reno to be the first woman
attorney-general of the US.
She will be sworn into office within the next day or two.
The 54-year-old state prosecutor from Miami, Florida, had sailed through two
days of hearings without controversy, but also diplomatically revealing
little about her views on some of the difficult questions confronting the
justice department.
These range from deciding whether to retain Judge William Sessions as head
of the FBI to the continued use of special prosecutors in such cases as
Iran-Contra.
She satisfied Democrats by her commitment to civil rights, environmental
protection and gun control, and pleased Republicans with her tough approach
to control of crime.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Milosevic denies full backing to peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia yesterday refused to give a clear
endorsement to the peace settlement for Bosnia-Hercegovina proposed by
international mediators.
However he did apparently agree to try and persuade his Serb allies in
Bosnia to attend talks in New York early next week on the Vance-Owen peace
plan.
'We cannot say whether the peace accord should be adopted in its present
form. It is up to the three (Bosnian) communities to decide,' he said after
talks with Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, hosted by France's President
Francois Mitterrand in Paris.
Lord Owen said at a joint press conference with Mr Vance after the first
round of talks that it was 'too early to say whether President Milosevic
will put pressure on Mr (Radovan) Karadzic (the leader of the Bosnian
Serbs).'
The mediators rejected a suggestion by the Serbian president that
implementation of the peace settlement should start with the application of
the military agreement, notably a ceasefire.
Mr Milosevic said he thought the Bosnian Serbs would respect a ceasefire.
However, Lord Owen said it would be inappropriate for a ceasefire to be
implemented separately from a constitutional agreement and the map of the 10
provinces into which it has been proposed that Bosnia should be divided.
He said that if a ceasefire came into effect without the other elements, the
Bosnian Serbs would hold on to the 70 per cent of Bosnian territory which
they presently occupied. The map provides for a division of territory which
would give the Bosnian Serbs only 43 per cent.
Mr Vance said they had discussed with Mr Milosevic the prospect of more
draconian sanctions against Serbia if the Bosnian Serbs blocked the peace
plan.
The US and Britain have drafted tougher sanctions which they want the
Security Council to impose if the Serbs obstruct the negotiations.
Mr Milosevic said the time had come for the UN to lift sanctions against
Serbia.
Lord Owen quoted Mr Mitterrand as telling Mr Milosevic: 'Whatever the rights
or wrongs (of sanctions), if there is no settlement, the world will take
action.'
According to Lord Owen, Mr Milosevic had told them that he had only limited
influence over the Bosnian Serbs, but the mediators believe that in fact he
has substantial influence over Mr Karadzic.
The meeting, hosted at the Elysee Palace, was undermined even before it
started by statements by both the Bosnian Moslems and Serbs that they would
not endorse the peace plan in its present form.
Mr Vance and Lord Owen had hoped to isolate Mr Karadzic. But they were
thwarted when President Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem Bosnian president,
said on Wednesday he would not return to the peace talks in New York at the
end of this week to sign the mediators' map, as he had previously intimated.
Mr Izetbegovic has delayed his return to New York until the middle of next
week at the earliest, pending further consultations in Bosnia.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Brazil braced for new shot at economic goal: A report on the
prospects for the new finance minister, beset by inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ALL Brazilians, they say, have their own dream team to play in the national
soccer side - and their own solution for combating inflation, now at an
annual 1,500 per cent.
Some seven team managers and eight finance ministers have had their chance
to try their hand with various shock plans and strategies in the past eight
years, but neither Brazil's football nor its economy has prospered. Another
change at the top of the Finance Ministry last week prompted fears that a
further shock plan was on its way, despite the past failure of such
measures.
All the signs are there. Inflation is nearing 30 per cent a month, at which
point desperate governments of the past have slapped on price freezes and
seized assets. Recession is in its fourth year and the government is yet to
finalise the budget this year. President Itamar Franco is under increasing
pressure to act.
His political allies, though, have been quick to warn against the
longer-term consequences of shock 'heterodox' measures such as a price and
wage freeze. 'If we've learnt anything in the past few years it is that
magic solutions don't work,' says Mr Tasso Jereissati, leader of the Social
Democrat party (PSDB) who met the president on Tuesday. 'The real problem to
tackle is public finances.'
For the moment, the pendulum seems to have swung away from heterodox
measures in favour of serious fiscal adjustment. Mr Eliseu Resende, the new
finance minister, ruled out shock plans in his first public pronouncement
this week.
What he does intend to do is not yet clear. As the third finance minister in
just five months and a minister under military regimes, Mr Resende faces a
serious public credibility problem. But Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
foreign minister and one of Mr Franco's closest advisers, says the situation
is better than it looks.
He points out that exports are booming, a new law deregulating Brazil's
backward port system has been passed and on Wednesday night the Senate
approved a new tax to raise Dollars 600m per month to help the government
balance its books. The government's economics team has also developed a
serious programme of fiscal discipline which it is now trying to convince
the president to adopt.
Mr Fernando Antoni Hadba, aide to the chief economic policy maker, explains:
'All past shock plans tackled the effects of inflation such as prices rather
than the causes.' The new plan lays the main blame on the government
domestic debt of Dollars 132bn, of which Dollars 36bn is short-term 28-day
Treasury bills in the hands of the public and the rest held by the central
bank.
Though larger than Brazil's foreign debt, the domestic debt is not
unmanageable for an economy with a gross domestic product of Dollars 400bn.
The problem is how it is financed - through issuing more short-term high
interest rate bonds - and the narrowness of the monetary base of just 1 per
cent of GDP. The current situation, where Treasury debt is being rolled over
at the rate of one monetary base per week, is highly unstable.
The current idea is to separate the Treasury and the central bank, forcing
the former to adjust in what Mr Hadba calls 'an institutional shock'.
Once independent and freed from bailing out the Treasury, the central bank
could then preset monetary targets. To cut its operational deficit to zero
the Treasury would then have to renegotiate debts such as Dollars 50bn owed
by states and municipalities, Dollars 20bn owed to the electrical sector and
an enormous debt to the social security and pension funds.
To raise funds to repay some of short-term debt, the ministry would
accelerate privatisation, suspended since December, and sell off some big
names such as Vale do Rio Doce, the world-class state mining company which
it estimates could raise Dollars 8bn-Dollars 10bn.
Once the arch-enemy of privatisation, Mr Franco has apparently been won
over, shocked by the inefficiency and privileges of the state sector which
this year will cost the government some Dollars 19bn.
It is also hoped to lengthen the maturity of Treasury debt by offering a
dollar or inflation-linked return with interest guaranteed by foreign
reserves. The consequent reduction in government needs to raise money would
enable a lowering of interest rates from the current real 20-30 per cent.
Prices would be kept under control through a strengthened anti-trust law. A
government mission is currently in the US studying this.
The policy team estimates that this strategy will reduce inflation to an
'acceptable level' of an annual 15-20 per cent within a year. 'It is not an
overnight solution,' says Mr Hadba, 'but for a country which has been in
crisis for 10 years, it is not long.'
The plan sounds plausible. But even its architects, appointed by the
previous minister, do not know if they will still be in their jobs next
week. And although the new minister has approved much of the plan, he must
then persuade Mr Franco who has pledged that all measures must receive
congressional approval - a Herculean task in a country with 18 political
parties.
Although the threat of a return to the shock plan may have receded, nobody
is ruling it out. With just 22 months left in office, Mr Franco says he
wants quick results. He could easily change his mind again.

praised by UN high commissioner for refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MRS SADAKO OGATA, United Nations high commissioner for refugees, yesterday
praised the US decision to undertake an airdrop of humanitarian supplies in
eastern Bosnia, saying it was relieving much suffering, writes Michael
Littlejohns.
But in a closed-door briefing for the UN Security Council, she emphasised
that the operation could never be a substitute for land convoys, which still
constituted her agency's first priority. During the past few weeks lack of
land access had resulted in a 50 per cent reduction in food aid, previously
running at 8,000 tonnes a week.
Mrs Ogata will have talks in Washington with the Clinton administration
today.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Murder of abortion doctor inflames America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE murder of a doctor outside an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida, on
Wednesday has further inflamed passions in one of America's most divisive
and increasingly violent social confrontations.
Yesterday, Mr Randall Terry, national leader of Operation Rescue, the
anti-abortion movement, described the killing of the doctor as 'an
inappropriate, repulsive act'. He immediately went on to say 'we must also
grieve for the thousands of children that he has murdered'.
Ms Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortions Rights Action League,
countered by attacking 'the campaign of violence and intolerance' now being
waged by the anti-abortion forces.
Dr David Gunn was shot dead outside his clinic by Mr Michael Frederick
Griffin, who immediately surrendered to police. Mr Griffin, according to
another Florida anti-abortion activist, had on Sunday urged a church service
to 'agree with him that Dr Gunn should give his life to Jesus Christ.'
Yesterday Mr Griffin asked a court hearing that he be allowed to keep his
Bible with him in jail 'as a legal document.' His supporters began an effort
to raise funds for his family and his defence and spoke of him as a 'martyr'
in a just cause.
The murder of Dr Gunn appears to be the first recorded in an anti-abortion
demonstration. But it takes place against a pattern of increasingly violent
protest. In mid-February a clinic in Corpus Christi, Texas, was firebombed,
while earlier this week eight clinics in California were sprayed with
noxious acid.
According to the National Abortion Federation, there were 186 recorded
instances of violence against the providers of abortion last year, twice as
many as in the previous year. In the first two months of this year, a
further 27 incidents were registered.
Operation Rescue and affiliated organisations have been particularly active
in Florida, using what are known as 'impact teams' to harass both clinic
personnel and patients. In a letter to President Bill Clinton, Ms Eleanor
Smeal, head of the Feminist Majority Foundation, called such tactics 'a
reign of domestic terror'.
The advent of Mr Clinton, who believes in freedom of reproductive choice,
does appear to have driven opponents of abortion to greater extremes. He has
already rescinded several directives of Presidents Bush and Reagan which
denied federal funds to organisations which countenance abortion as a means
of family planning.
The Reagan administration had even issued a directive that the US could
grant political asylum to those claiming to be fleeing countries where
abortion was widely practised, as, for example, in China.
Anti-abortion activists like Mr Terry are also convinced that President
Clinton will make pro-choice convictions a litmus test for judicial
appointments, the exact reverse of the practice of President Bush.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Call for action on digital HDTV
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community was pressed yesterday to move quickly to develop
transmission standards for digital high-definition television.
In a letter circulated to EC governments, Mr Helge Israelsen, Denmark's
director general of post and telecommunications, warns of 'chaos' if swift
action were not taken to set digital standards.
By emphasising the development of digital television technology, Denmark -
current president of the Community - hopes to break the political impasse
holding up an EC strategy for wide-screen, cinema-quality television.
Britain is blocking agreement on a five-year Ecu500m (Pounds 413m) EC
funding plan, on the grounds that digital television technology, already
under development in the US and the Community, could soon overtake analogue
HDTV standards supported by the draft funding plan.
The Danish initiative is not intended to promote an exclusive technology,
competing with US digital systems, but to prevent rival standards springing
up within the Community.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, has suggested that the EC
does not need to develop exclusive digital standards because European
manufacturers, notably Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France, are
already involved in the race to produce a digital television standard for
the US.
The Commission will today clarify its position today, by indicating that US
digital TV technology could not be adopted directly by the EC, although
Community digital standards would probably have several elements in common
with non-EC technologies.
The compromise circulated by Mr Israelsen appears to go a long way towards
meeting the UK's objections to the original EC strategy. It suggests the
Community should:
use funding to encourage the production and broadcast of wide-screen
non-HDTV television programmes over the next four years, irrespective of
transmission standards;
revise and expand existing legislation so that it allows different
technologies to be used for wide-screen transmissions;
initiate plans for development of a single digital television standard, or a
'family' of standards.
The Danish presidency wants the Commission to propose a revised directive on
transmission standards and a strategy for digital television by September 1,
and will seek ministers' backing for the compromise at the
telecommunications council on May 10, if not before.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday took steps to tighten the naval blockade of Serbia and
Montenegro by adding 25 shipping companies to its list of groups with which
US citizens are barred from doing business.
The US Treasury said the Yugoslav-controlled shipping companies, with a
combined fleet of 55 vessels, had tried to hide their ownership by using
foreign front companies, changing vessel names and reflagging ships.
Mr Richard Newcomb, director of the Treasury's office of foreign asset
control, said: 'Yugoslavia has continued to trade through its maritime fleet
in flagrant violation of United Nations sanctions. Publication of these
names sends a clear signal: the United States will deny the Serbs and
Montenegrins any benefit of regular international commerce.'
The new list of Yugoslav-controlled shipping companies is headed by Milena
Ship Management and Rigel Shipmanagement, two Montenegrin-owned Maltese
companies which between them control 40 bulk and general cargo vessels.
The US can levy fines of up to Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 352,000) on companies
or Dollars 250,000 on individuals for violations of the Yugoslav embargo,
imposed in May 1992. The Treasury has already frozen some Dollars 525m in
Yugoslav assets since the sanctions were imposed, and seven Yugoslav ships
have been held in US ports.
The US is working with Serbia's neighbouring countries to plug the steady
flow of sanctions-breaking goods along the Danube into Serbia.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Assembell Nationale (Elections '93): French parties called
to arms on conscription - President Mitterrand and a future right-wing
government face an early skirmish over the military
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF THE first clashes between France's likely new conservative government
and its incumbent Socialist president could be over conscription. President
Francois Mitterrand sees no reason to change compulsory military service,
introduced 200 years ago to fight off the French Revolution's foreign
enemies.
He claims 'nothing can replace the collective effort, without which national
defence loses its true sense' - a view endorsed two weeks ago at what was
probably one of the last cabinet meetings chaired by Mr Pierre Beregovoy as
prime minister.
Opposition pressure for a professional army is growing, although it is found
less among the centre-right UDF than among the RPR Gaullists, who true to
their founder are more concerned with matters military. And within the RPR
conscription still has its champions. But Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR
president, has tipped his hand by calling for units, if not the whole army,
which are 'purely professional'. The practical problem with the present
system lies with the army, composed 60 per cent of conscripts (compared with
39 per cent for the air force and 30 per cent for the navy). Two years ago,
France encountered difficulty and delay in disentangling conscripts from
regular forces to field 12,000 purely professional troops in the Gulf war.
Since then it has allowed conscripts to volunteer for United Nations service
in ex-Yugoslavia, Cambodia and Somalia. But with Bosnia proving more
dangerous than the Gulf, there is always the possibility that this practice
might have to be reversed.
But there are more serious political objections to conscription. Far from
being universal, fewer than half France's male 18-year-olds end up in
uniform, compared with 70 per cent 15 years ago. Many undertake alternative
duties in local public services or even in companies, and a humanitarian
service in developing countries has been created.
But there are also dodges. If a young man fails his military medical, he
also gets out of any civilian service. Two thirds of those who pass their
medical get some sort of deferment, which also often ends in total
exemption. Inevitably, it is middle-class youth which makes most use of any
such ruses.
While sticking to the conscription principle, Mr Pierre Joxe, the defence
minister, has promised to reverse the pattern of recent years which has
actually seen a slight decline in the ratio of regular to conscript
soldiers. The Joxe plan is to reduce the army from 260,000 now to 225,000 by
1997, with the number of conscripts then (115,000) only barely above the
number of volunteer professionals (110,000).
Set against this is a plan by Mr Francois Fillon, the young RPR deputy who
heads the national assembly's defence committee, to have a wholly
professional army of 185,000 within five years and to reduce conscription
from 10 months to a nominal three months for service within France.
This is too radical a change to be welcomed by the French high command,
which - only partly at Mr Joxe's urging - detailed its objections last week.
First, said General Yves Crene, deputy chief-of-staff, the Fillon plan would
take seven years to implement. Second, most of those currently enlisting as
regular soldiers are conscripts who know what they are letting themselves in
for. So, concluded Gen Crene, 'the best way of recruiting professionals is
to recruit conscripts'.
Finally - and probably most important in view of budget deficits - is the
extra cost of going professional. General Crene put this at FFr4bn (Pounds
500m) to FFr5bn a year. This stems not only from higher pay (a conscript's
basic pay is only FFr500 a month) for enlisted men, but also from the need
to provide pensions and discharge payments. The general claimed Britain's
professional army of around 130,000 costs 20 per cent more to run than
France's current force and was 'no better equipped'.
Some independent French experts applaud Mr Fillon's call for more
professionalism but doubt whether France, even in an era of high
unemployment, can attract enough volunteers.
Mr Francois Heisbourg, a former director of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London, notes the difficulty Britain has had in filling
its army's ranks, and cautions that 'France is remarkably similar to Britain
in demographic and sociological terms'.
If France's military goals remain unchanged, Mr Heisbourg says, it needs at
least 20,000 to 30,000 more troops than Britain to carry out old commitments
in Africa and new commitments to the UN.
One way of settling the fate of conscription would be to put it to a
referendum. Mr Chirac has hinted he would like this. But since both
president and prime minister would have to be agree, such a tactic may not
be possible for Mr Mitterrand's two remaining years in the Elysee Palace.

THE governor of the Bank of Portugal, Mr Miguel Beleza, was reported
yesterday to have resigned, along with his deputy, Mr Antonio Borges, whose
resignation was confirmed by the Ministry of Finance, Reuter reports from
Lisbon.
The two bankers were said to have stepped down following policy
disagreements with the finance minister, Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo.
Portugal's TSF Radio said the governor had handed in a letter of
resignation, although there was no official confirmation or denial of his
move. However, the ministry of finance, confirmed that his deputy, Mr
Borges, had decided to quit. The statement added that the ministry would
recommend that the cabinet accept the resignation.
Rumours that Mr Borges might resign circulated last Friday after Mr Jorge
Braga de Macedo, made a speech in which he urged the central bank to take
into account the real economy in its monetary policy.
'The Bank of Portugal cannot underestimate the negative signs of the real
economy which accumulated throughout 1992,' Mr Braga de Macedo had said. The
finance minister added that the central bank had 'underestimated noisy signs
from agriculture, trade and industry'. Mr Beleza was appointed central bank
governor in mid-1992, two years after Mr Borges became vice-governor.
Mr Borges handed in his resignation letter last week.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Arrest of chairmen may speed flotation at Eni
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARREST of the chairmen of the three most important subsidiaries at
Italy's Eni energy and chemicals group, on charges of illegal funding of
political parties and falsifying company accounts, continues the progressive
managerial decapitation of the group.
The detentions follow the arrest on Monday night of Mr Gabriele Cagliari,
Eni's chairman, and Mr Franco Chiatti, chairman of its Nuovo Pignone
turbines subsidiary, and highlight the attention being paid to Eni by
Milanese magistrates leading the country's political corruption
investigations.
The arrests of Mr Raffaele Santoro, Mr Pio Pigorini and Mr Giovanni
dell'Orto, chairmen of Eni's Agip petroleum, Snam gas distribution and
Saipem exploration subsidiaries, were accompanied by raids by magistrates
and the Guardia di Finanza fiscal police on the group's offices on the
outskirts of Milan. Offices in the Agip, Snam and Saipem buildings were
sealed by police on Wednesday night.
The arrests mark the second big blow this week to the government's
privatisation programme following the incarceration on Monday of Mr Chiatti,
whose company is one of the most prominent candidates for disposal. Both
Agip and Snam had been hoping to float part of their capital under a
long-heralded scheme to bring in private shareholders.
Yesterday, some executives claimed the arrests could accelerate, rather than
obstruct, privatisation. Once the current investigations are completed, Eni
may need a clean sweep to restore its international standing.
The departure of top executives from its most powerful subsidiaries could
also reduce internal bickering and tilt the balance in favour of floating
group rather than individual operations.
Arguments over the form of flotation have been one of the biggest obstacles
to speedy privatisation.
Agip, which had net profits of L1,101bn (Pounds 502m) on sales of L10,957bn
in 1991, is Eni's main operation in upstream oil and gas.
Snam is responsible for gas supply and distribution, as well as providing a
variety of group services such as property management and communications. In
1991, it reported net earnings of L635.7bn on sales of L11,479bn. The
smaller Saipem, which made a 1991 loss of L129bn on sales of L1,624bn, is
involved in energy-related drilling and construction.
Eni's other subsidiaries include its big, loss-making EniChem operation,
which is already under scrutiny. Italgas, the retail gas distribution arm,
and the Snamprogetti engineering business have so far remained outside the
magistrates' net.

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN faces the prospect of an early general election after the minority
government yesterday decided to seek a vote of confidence in its economic
policies next Wednesday.
The crisis was triggered by the opposition New Democracy party, which
unexpectedly voted against two government bills on Wednesday, throwing into
question the government's ability to implement its economic policies
Although there were indications late yesterday of a compromise, it was still
unclear whether the government would secure New Democracy backing in the
vote. Failure to do so would trigger a general election in May or June. This
would be the first time for 35 years that an election had been called early,
and would be well before the government's current three-year mandate expires
in September 1994.
The populist New Democracy denies trying to force an early election, but
says it wants to be more broadly consulted on economic policy. In return for
its support, it wants the government to stimulate Sweden's
recession-stricken economy, by lowering value added tax or petrol taxes.
This is a difficult demand for the government to concede at a time when the
budget deficit is SKr200bn (Pounds 18.2bn). New Democracy might, however,
support the government in the vote in exchange for greater consultation over
the contents of next month's supplementarybudget.
Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, has not disguised his exasperation at
what he considers a last-minute change of tactics by New Democracy, which
the government says casts doubt over the party's reliability.
The government felt it had secured the party's support both for its general
economic policy and a specific motion relating to pensions, before they were
rejected.
Mr Lars Christiansson, chief spokesman for Mr Bildt, said: 'The crisis is
not over and it is impossible to see how next Wednesday's vote will go.' He
added that no direct talks between the government and New Democracy were
currently scheduled.
However, the latest opinion polls suggest an election would bring the Social
Democrats back to power. 'The logical and natural decision if the government
cannot govern is to call an election and let the people have their say,'
said Mr Ingvar Carlsson, Social Democrats leader.
The political uncertainty led to a sharp fall in the krona and higher money
market interest rates yesterday.

FT  12 MAR 93 / G7's move to back Yeltsin gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations will gather in
Hong Kong at the weekend, paving the way for a possible early G7 ministerial
meeting to assess the mounting political and economic crisis in Russia.
The Hong Kong meeting will be attended by Mr Boris Fyodorov, Russia's deputy
prime minister. It is expected to explore the convening of a special meeting
of G7 foreign and finance ministers in Washington next month, and comes as a
response to Tuesday's call from President Bill Clinton for an early
consideration of the Russian situation. Japan last month rejected a call
from the EC to bring forward the date of the G7 summit scheduled to be held
in Tokyo in July. The moves will be widely seen as an attempt by the G7
nations to provide moral support for President Boris Yeltsin, who is engaged
in a fierce political battle with opponents over the course of economic
reform.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, told his weekly news
conference in Paris yesterday: 'Russia needs economic help . . . It is
necessary for Japan and the US to help more,' adding that 'a meeting of G7
heads of state should take place as soon as possible. It remains to fix the
date.'
In Washington, officials said no decisions had yet been taken on the time,
place or level of a formal G7 meeting.
'There does seem to be interest among various parties for an earlier meeting
of the G7 to discuss Russia. I don't know if you could call it a stampede,'
said Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary.
Other officials indicated that there would probably be no decision until
after Mr Clinton and President Yeltsin meet in Vancouver on April 3-4.
Mr Yohei Kono, the Japanese cabinet secretary, said the Hong Kong meeting
would be an opportunity to hear about developments in the Russian economy.
Deputy finance ministers will also meet in Hong Kong to plan the April
meeting which is expected to draw up plans for further assistance to Russia.
The Russian issue is likely to prove increasingly difficult for the Japanese
government in the run-up to the July summit. Its anxiety that the summit
should run smoothly is balanced by its unwillingness to consider further
economic aid to Russia.
The formal reason is that Japan has still not settled its territorial
dispute over the sovereignty of four islands off the northern tip of Japan.
However, Japanese relations with Russia have markedly worsened in the wake
of Mr Yeltsin's sudden cancellation of his planned visit to Tokyo last
September. Since then Japanese opposition to further aid to Russia has
hardened. In addition, officials in Japan's finance and trade ministries
believe that further aid would be, in the words of one, 'like pouring money
down a sieve'. The US, Germany, France and the UK, on the other hand, are
expressing growing concern about Mr Yeltsin's precarious hold on power.

<TEXT>
The rivalry between France's two main opposition parties to provide the
country's next prime minister gained a new twist in opinion poll findings
yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris.
A Sofres poll suggested that Mr Edouard Balladur, the RPR's former finance
minister, would be far more popular as prime minister among the combined
supporters of the Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF parties than any UDF
candidate. Mr Balladur has 41 per cent backing among UDF supporters alone.
But an Ifop poll in yesterday's edition of L'Express magazine put the UDF,
albeit by only half a percentage point, ahead of the RPR's general support
for the first time. They are opposing each other in only 69 constituencies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST of the people who are trying to run Russia spoke on the second day of
the Eighth Congress of Peoples Deputies yesterday - and presented starkly
different visions of the country's future. Standing before a nervy, easily
roused house, they dispensed with any effort to compromise or soothe in
favour of bitter, personal attacks and mutual attribution of blame.
Never less than tense, often ugly and irresponsible, the debate showed how
wide is the gulf now between the levels of Russian power. President Boris
Yeltsin, insisting on his own primacy as the only popularly elected
official, demanded that the presidency be strengthened and that his
government be given full control of the country's main financial
institutions.
'Don't you understand', he asked the deputies, 'that when the legislative
power tries to eliminate the power of the president, this destroys the
constitutional structure of contemporary Russia, contradicts the peoples'
will?'
It was a speech poorly delivered, without conviction, receiving no applause.
By contrast, Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin gave a strong, emphatic
performance, underscoring that it was 'strong presidential power that is a
guarantor of reforms' - but insisting that the government could not be a
'pale shadow' of the president. 'The government cannot see through economic
reform unless it is given effective means for managing the economy.'
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker who has in past congresses
emerged in the role of a reluctant mediator, has in this session cast aside
any effort to do so.
In a fluently bitter, largely extemporised speech, he attacked both
president and prime minister equally, repudiating the agreement to hold a
referendum reached at the December Congress with Mr Yeltsin as 'the work of
the devil', defending the deputies as honest toilers in the legislative
vineyard while the president's men 'swagger before the microphones, blaming
us for this, that and the other'.
He called for the resignation of Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime
minister in charge of privatisation, threatened to block ministerial
salaries and said that parliament would not pass the government's budget.
Sarcastically, he asked Mr Chernomyrdin who was in charge of his cabinet -
expressing the disappointment felt by many of the centrist deputies that the
prime minister, seen on his election as a moderate, had gone over to the
radical reformers.
In brief appearances at the end of the session - after Congress had already
approved in principle a draft resolution cancelling the referendum and
ending a moratorium on making further incursions into the presidential
powers - Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, and Mr Valery
Zorkin, president of the Constitutional Court, both essentially sided with
the Congress.
The debate ended with the tension unresolved: the crucial, final vote on a
draft resolution dividing the powers not yet taken, and no official word on
whether Mr Yeltsin would bow to another unfavourable compromise or take the
'decisive measures' he and his circle have hinted at. But even now, it is
clear that the crisis has only deepened.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Germany's business community yesterday called for an urgent end
to the months of negotiations over a solidarity pact to finance east German
recovery, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl launched his last-ditch bid for
agreement.
The four business leaders representing employers, industry, commerce and
small enterprises, called for public spending cuts, not tax increases, to be
the key to the pact, which is intended to revive the east German economy and
guarantee long-term cash transfers from the west.
Their plea was backed in a new report on the state of the German economy by
Ifo, the Munich-based economic research institute, which said the current
sharp recession could bottom out before the end of the year, provided that
the solidarity pact negotiations come to a clear and swift conclusion.
The institute said manufacturing was clearly in recession, but it argued
that the current pessimism in business and banking circles was exaggerated.
'In spite of the extremely precarious situation, one cannot talk of 'the
worst recession since the war', or even of an 'economic catastrophe', as
some people are doing,' Ifo said.
The sharpness of the downturn was in part a clear reaction to the abnormal
upswing caused by the reunification of Germany in 1990.
The business leaders saw Chancellor Kohl yesterday immediately before he
opened a two-day, closed-door conference with the 16 prime ministers of
Germany's Lander (federal states), and the opposition Social Democrats, to
finalise his long-awaited solidarity pact.
Mr Bjorn Engholm, the leader of the opposition SPD and prime minister of
Schleswig-Holstein, and Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the Christian Democrat prime
minister of Saxony, in east Germany - both key players in the talks -
expressed cautious optimism about a possible compromise.
Mr Kohl's strategy appears to be to focus on ways to cut federal and state
spending before allowing the debate to move on to possible tax increases.
The SPD and several of the states say that a tax increase from July 1, in
the form of a 'solidarity surcharge' on income tax, is unavoidable.
Mr Kohl and his finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, along with the business
sector, say that tax increases before 1995 would be 'poison for the
economy'.
The Ifo institute yesterday rejected tax rises only for 1993.

THE political disputes which have paralysed Russia are also threatening to
envelop Ukraine, where President Leonid Kravchuk yesterday appeared to be
heading for a confrontation with the reformist government of the prime
minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma.
Mr Kravchuk's acerbic criticism of the government's draft budget left the
country uncertain as to whether he supports the tough market reforms
launched earlier this year by the prime minister. On Wednesday, Mr Kravchuk
took the unusual step of appearing at a cabinet meeting, where he fiercely
rejected the draft budget under review.
Ironically, Mr Kravchuk's criticism of the budget may offer a boost to
Ukraine's nascent economic reforms. Although the draft budget proposed to
cut the deficit from last year's high of 36 per cent of GNP to 7 per cent of
GNP it was described as inadequate by market-minded economists and western
financial organisations.
'I think that the budget was genuinely incomplete,' said Mr Oleksandr
Savchenko, an advocate of radical economic reforms who helped write the
government's economic reform programme. However, the manner in which Mr
Kravchuk attacked the draft budget suggests he may be mounting an open
political offensive against the prime minister, whose reforms have begun to
erode the power of the ex-communist elite which forms Mr Kravchuk's main
power base.
'The president's address had political motives,' a senior cabinet official
said yesterday. Mr Kravchuk, who had not appeared before cabinet in the past
six months, chose to address the meeting at the eleventh hour. Illness
prevented both Mr Kuchma and Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, the radical minister of the
economy, from attending.
Moreover, Mr Kravchuk - who criticised the draft budget both for containing
too few anti-inflationary measures and for not providing enough social
welfare protection - suggested the creation of an 'anti-crisis unit' to
oversee the work of the government.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Glaxo removes chief executive after board row: Departure
follows disputes with regulatory and government authorities in Europe and US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR ERNEST MARIO, chief executive and deputy chairman of Glaxo Holdings,
Europe's biggest drugs group, was ousted yesterday after falling out with
the rest of the board.
Sir Paul Girolami, chairman, said Dr Mario had not been removed for any
single reason. 'It was far more complicated than that. He was not the right
man for the future,' he said.
Dr Mario, 54, who was appointed chief executive in 1989, said he had
resigned because of differences of opinion over the running of the business.
Dr Mario last year received a salary, including bonuses, of Pounds 975,000.
Neither he nor Sir Paul would spell out the cause of disagreement. One
possibility was Dr Mario's aggressive American management style, which sat
uneasily within a conservative British company. In the past 18 months, Glaxo
has had a series of public disputes with regulatory and government
authorities in Europe and the US.
Another possible cause was differences over Glaxo's strategic direction. Dr
Mario was thought to have wanted to make a substantial rights issue to
finance a large acquisition, possibly Warner-Lambert of the US. This would
have allowed Glaxo to re-enter the over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription
drug market.
Sir Paul denied yesterday there had been any difference of opinion over
Glaxo's OTC intentions. 'Even if it had been true that we had disagreed over
the OTC question, it's incredible that it would have been a leaving issue.'
Sir Paul said that when Dr Mario was appointed chief executive the board had
been aware he had no tremendous feel for an extremely sensitive industry,
was relatively new to the group, had more experience in OTC drugs than in
prescription medicines, had not been a member of the board of a publicly
quoted company for long, and had never worked outside the US.
'If you take that into account, the fact that we still appointed him shows
the respect and esteem we held him in,' Sir Paul said. 'All those factors
played a role in (his departure at) the end.'
Dr Mario's departure was accompanied by a wider shake-up at Glaxo, which Sir
Paul said was intended to strengthen the group's central organisation.
Dr Richard Sykes, research and development director, has been appointed in
Dr Mario's place, but retains his R&amp;D responsibilities. Dr Franz Humer,
director in charge of commercial policy and eastern Europe, Africa and the
Middle East, has been appointed to a new position, chief operating officer.
Sir John Cuckney, a non-executive, has been appointed as non-executive
vice-chairman.
The reshuffle would also help the issue of his successor, said Sir Paul, who
will be 68 in January and is due to retire when he reaches 70. He said that,
with Dr Mario as chief executive, there had not been many candidates for
chairman. Now, although Dr Sykes had first claim, there were three or four
candidates.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Rolls-Royce to cut 5,000 jobs after pre-tax loss of Pounds
184m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine and industrial power group, is to shed 5,000
jobs over the next two years and cut its dividend after incurring a Pounds
184m pre-tax loss in 1992.
The latest restructuring, announced yesterday, was attacked by Rolls-Royce's
unions and the Labour party as a 'bitter blow' for British industry.
The company, which has cut 12,000 jobs in the past two years, said it had
been forced to restructure because of the decline in military business and
the turmoil in the world airline industry.
Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, said 3,000 jobs would be lost this year and
2,000 in 1994. All the job cuts will involve aerospace activities with about
half affecting the military engine business and the rest the civil side.
The latest cuts will mean a 10 per cent fall in the Rolls-Royce workforce
from 51,800 employees at the end of last year to 46,800 by the end of 1994.
In 1990, the company employed 64,200 people.
Mr Terry Harrison, chief executive, said Rolls-Royce was continuing to
consolidate its manufacturing activities around a few larger plants by
shutting four smaller facilities, including the helicopter engine plant at
Leavesden, Hertfordshire, a components plant at Parkside, Coventry, a metal
fabrication plant at Mountsorrel, Leicestershire, and a facility at Rodney,
near Bristol.
The biggest cuts will affect the Derby civil aircraft operations, which will
lose 1,545 jobs, and the Bristol military engine activities, which will shed
1,400 jobs.
Rolls-Royce made a Pounds 180m provision in its 1992 accounts to cover the
latest job cuts and plant rationalisation programme and a further Pounds 50m
provision to cover bad debts. There was an additional Pounds 38m provision
to cover restructuring during 1992.
Excluding these exceptional items totalling Pounds 268m (Pounds 58m in
1991), Rolls-Royce reported a profit of Pounds 84m compared with Pounds
109m. After exceptional items, the pre-tax loss of Pounds 184m compared with
a Pounds 51m pre-tax profit the previous year.
Sir Ralph said that Rolls-Royce had maintained a strong balance sheet with
positive cash flow and no debt and that the order book had increased by
Pounds 100m to Pounds 6.7bn in a particularly difficult year for both
aerospace and industrial power operations. Turnover was flat at Pounds
3.56bn.
A loss per share of 20.91p compares with earnings per share of 2.49p in
1991. The final dividend of 2.45p (4.7p) reduces the total to 5p (7.25p).
The share price ended 2 1/2 p up at 131 1/2 p.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Stock market chief quits over Taurus: Scrapping of computer
settlement system to cost 350 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE of the London Stock Exchange, Mr Peter Rawlins, resigned
yesterday as its board voted to abandon Taurus, its planned paperless
settlement system.
Mr Rawlins was held responsible for the failure of a 12-year project which
had already cost the exchange Pounds 75m and is thought to have cost other
City institutions much more.
The Bank of England stepped into the breach and announced that it had set up
its own task force to examine how to overhaul settlement arrangements in the
London stock market.
It will be led by Mr Pen Kent, a Bank associate director, who has taken a
close interest in recent years in promoting a better stock market settlement
system.
The task force, set up hastily after news of the Taurus fiasco reached the
Bank on Monday, will look for a 'cheap and quick' solution, a Bank official
said.
The closure of Taurus will mean the loss of 350 jobs at the stock exchange,
130 of them held by contract staff. It will also lead to other job losses as
financial institutions that had been rebuilding their own systems to be
compatible with Taurus reduce their development work.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the stock exchange, refused to say
whether he had offered his own resignation, but said he had discussed his
future with the board before it was decided that he should stay on. He also
took over as chief executive until a replacement can be found from outside
the exchange.
Sir Andrew said: 'The board as a whole, and I myself, feel great concern at
the human cost, which will be very painful both in my own organisation and
around the City.'
The failure of the project rested in large part on the design that was
adopted in 1989, he said. In an attempt to reconcile many different
interests, the system had been too complex and could not be built without
significant extra cost and time.
He also blamed the exchange's management team for failing to realise early
enough the implications of the project. 'There may have been an element of
self-delusion in this,' he said.
Significant problems became clear to senior executives outside the project
only at the end of last year. It was established in the past 10 days that it
would take a further three years to complete the project, doubling the final
cost to the City. The exchange's own costs are 'only a small proportion of
the total cost', he said. Some estimates have put the cost so far at about
Pounds 400m.
Abandoning Taurus seems likely to lead to legal claims, as institutions
which have spent millions of pounds on the project seek to recover their
costs. 'I'm sure we will get claims,' Sir Andrew said. 'Our advice at the
moment is that it is very unlikely that we will be legally liable.'
The Bank of England task force includes representatives from the Treasury,
the Securities and In- vestments Board, the stock ex- change and other City
interests. It is due to report to the Bank governor by the end of June.
It will consider a partially automated system, allowing private investors to
continue to hold share certificates as at present while automating trading
by large institutions. It will also look at whether any systems in use
outside the UK can be adapted for use in London.
A Bank official said the current paper-based system had fallen behind
international standards and needed to be upgraded. He said scrapping Taurus
did not threaten London's position in international equity markets, because
the system was to handle only UK shares. He also said the UK stock market
could function on the current system for the foreseeable future.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Three Italian oil group heads held on corruption charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MILAN magistrates yesterday dealt a further blow to the political control of
Italy's state-run companies by arresting on corruption charges the heads of
the three most important subsidiaries of Eni, the national oil concern.
Mr Raffaele Santoro, chairman of Agip petroleum, Mr Pio Pigorini, head of
the Snam gas distribution unit, and Mr Giovanni dell'Orto, chairman of
Saipem, Eni's pipeline and engineering subsidiary, were arrested on charges
of illicit funding of political parties and falsifying company accounts.
They were taken by police to Milan's San Vittore prison, where a growing
number of Italy's business elite is being held.
The latest move was accompanied by extensive searches of the Milan offices
of the three Eni subsidiaries.
Yesterday police, who had sealed the buildings overnight, told employees
they could enter only after a floor-by-floor identification of their
contents and functions.
Yesterday's arrests followed those on Monday of Mr Gabriele Cagliari, Eni's
chairman, and Mr Franco Chiatti, head of the turbines subsidiary, Nuovo
Pignone, also on charges of illicit funding of political parties and
falsifying company accounts.
The latest detentions are believed to relate to incidents separate from
those affecting Mr Cagliari and Mr Chiatti, which concerned the illegal
payment of L4bn (Pounds 1.82m) to secure a power station contract.
The three arrests were directly connected to the interrogation on Wednesday
of an Italian financier with close links to Eni, Mr Pierfrancesco Pacini
Battaglia, who controls a Geneva-based bank, Karfinco. The bank is
understood to be connected with Eni's activities abroad.
To demonstrate support for the Eni management, prime minister Giuliano Amato
and Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister whose ministry formally controls
Eni, met Mr Francesco Bernabe, the group's chief executive.
In another and as yet unrelated incident Mr Roberto Ruberto,
director-general of Sace, Italy's export credit agency, was arrested and
charged with serious corruption.

FT  12 MAR 93 / Chief executive ousted in Glaxo board reshuffle: Departure

DR ERNEST MARIO, chief executive and deputy chairman of Glaxo Holdings,
Europe's biggest drugs group, has been ousted as part of a boardroom
reshuffle.
Sir Paul Girolami, chairman, said Dr Mario had not been removed for any
single reason. 'It was far more complicated than that. He was not the right
man for the future,' he said.
He insisted that the prime purpose of the reorganisation was to strengthen
the group's central organisation and to extend responsibility at the top of
a broader team.
Dr Mario, 54, said he had resigned because of differences of opinion over
the running of the business.
Glaxo's shares dropped 19p to 668p.
Dr Richard Sykes, research and development director, has been appointed in
Dr Mario's place, but retains his R&amp;D responsibilities.
Dr Franz Humer, director in charge of commercial policy and eastern Europe,
Africa and the Middle East, has been appointed to a new position, chief
operating officer. Sir John Cuckney, a non-executive, has been appointed as
non-executive vice-chairman.
Analysts were unsure whether the cause of Dr Mario's departure was his
aggressive American management style which sat uneasily within a

'Even if it had been true that we had disagreed over the OTC question, it's
incredible that it would have been a leaving issue,' he said.
Sir Paul said when Dr Mario been appointed as chief executive in 1989, the
board had been aware of four drawbacks.
These included the fact he had no tremendous feel for an extremely sensitive
industry; he was new to the group; he was not basically a prescription
medicines man, given his background in pharmacy; he had not been a member of
the board of a publicly-quoted company for long; and he had never operated
outside the US.
'If you take that into account, the fact that we still appointed him shows
the respect and esteem we held him in,' he said.
'All those factors played a role (in his departure at) the end.' Dr Mario
received a salary last year, including bonuses, of Pounds 975,000.
The reorganisation would also help the issue of his successor, said Sir
Paul, who will be 68 in January and is due to retire when he reaches 70.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Willis Corroon warns of dividend cut as
profits slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIS CORROON, the UK's largest insurance broker, warned that it will cut
its 1993 dividend after reporting a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from
Pounds 67.1m to Pounds 42.5m due to a Pounds 25.7m increase in provisions at
its Sovereign insurance subsidiary.
Willis declared an interim quarterly dividend of 1.65p, indicating that the
full year dividend could be cut by 50 per cent. A full year dividend for
1992 of 13.2p was declared three months ago.
Willis made a provision of Pounds 25.7m at Sovereign, as claims from
hurricane Hugo and other natural catastrophes from 1989, 1990 and 1991
continue to hit the company.
The company withdrew from the London commercial insurance and reinsurance
market in 1991. Additional pro-visions are also needed because some of the
company's reinsurers will not be able to meet claims.
'Some very serious problems are emerging. This is a very expensive baby to
put through school,' said Mr Charles Coyne, analyst with Credit Lyonnais
Laing.
Profit from brokerage and other ongoing insurance operations amounted to
Pounds 68.2m (Pounds 103.2m). Turnover rose to Pounds 607.2m (Pounds
577.3m), an increase of 1 per cent in underlying terms. Operating expenses
rose to Pounds 568.7m (Pounds 521m), or by 2 per cent in underlying terms,
partially reflecting increased expenditure on overseas acquisitions and an
expensive refurbishment at the company's Trinity Square headquarters.
Interest and investment income fell to Pounds 53.9m (Pounds 67.4m), as a
result of sharply lower interest rates.
COMMENT
Despite yesterday's news on the dividend front, there are still reasons to
be optimistic about Willis Corroon. The group should obtain benefit from the
stronger dollar, in which it earns about 40 per cent of its revenue, while
the strong performance by the Willis Faber &amp; Dumas subsidiary, indicates
things are going reasonably well in the London market, despite very tough
trading conditions. Looking ahead though, more losses at Sovereign cannot be
ruled out, while lower interest rates will continue to depress investment
income. In the United States there is still no guarantee of a turnaround in
rating, while Corroon &amp; Black has a lot of work to do to improve the rate at
which it is retaining customers.
Pre-tax profits could be pegged back to Pounds 60m this year. On yesterday's
closing price of 190p that puts the share on a prospective multiple of 20.
On balance, investors could well find better value elsewhere.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Observer: Overkill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brand names ought to be one of a company's greatest assets. So why should
GEC drop the Ferranti brand name, a share of which it acquired along with
Ferranti Defence Systems from the fraud-broken Ferranti International in
1990?
Probably the best bit of the business remaining, the Edinburgh-based defence
systems is built on radar and navigation expertise. Though facing a tough
market post-cold-war, it will provide the radar for the Eurofighter and may
be healthier than the independent rump of Ferranti, still short of returning
to profit since the split.
But come the end of the month, the Ferranti name will vanish from the GEC
empire, at least. GEC Ferranti is to be swallowed up by Marconi Avionics,
and the headquarters will switch from Edinburgh to Rochester in Kent.
The change is to do with 'optimising the management of the businesses in a
tough international market', it's said. But Observer doubts that such
phrases will help what will soon cease to be GEC Ferranti salesmen to
explain to puzzled foreign customers why a snappy name with a good industry
reputation should disappear.

FT  11 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Facility to boost E Europe travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MULTI-MILLION dollar facility to stimulate tourism in central and eastern
Europe is being launched this week by the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, in collaboration with the World Travel and Tourism Council.
The facility will be made up of three parts: a fund for infrastructure
projects linked with stimulating travel and tourism; a fund for private
sector tourism projects such as hotels and holiday resorts; a third,
smaller, tranche for consultants commissioned to make feasibility studies.
EBRD funds will be matched by private sector investment 'in the form of
know-how and expertise,' said Mr James D. Robinson, WTTC chairman.
Travel and tourism in the region have been badly hit lately. Earnings fell
more than 8 per cent between 1989 and 1990, the last year for which the WTTC
has data. Capital investment in the region's travel and tourism is projected
to fall from Dollars 76bn in 1990 to Dollars 65bn (Pounds 45.7bn) this year.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Fresh steel talks offer some hope for other sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN, DUSSELDORF
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IG Metall, Germany's big engineering union, and Arbeitgeberverband Stahl,
the steel employers association, will tomorrow start a fourth round of
arbitration talks for east Germany's steel sector. The outcome will be
watched closely by the union's members in the metal and electrical sectors.
The talks follow a decision by IG Metall's national advisory council to
proceed with strikes in the metal and electrical sectors in eastern Germany
after Gesamtmetall, the employers association, broke a contract which would
have led to parity between east and west German wages by 1994.
Under the terms of that agreement, signed in March 1991, east Germany's
metal and electrical sector would have received a 26 per cent pay increase
on April 1. That would have brought their incomes up to 82 per cent of
levels in the west.
Even though the steel arbitration talks concern largely the same demands, Mr
Michael Bohm, IG Metall's spokesman in Berlin, said the outcome of the
discussions could allow a way out for both the employers and the union's
metal and electrical sectors.
IG Metall is demanding a 20 per cent rise for east German steel workers, an
increase which would bring incomes in the sector up to 80 per cent of
western levels, even though productivity is at least 70 per cent lower in
the east.
'We are not asking for a shorter week, or longer holidays. We are asking for
a 20 per cent increase in wages. We are still talking. That is the important
thing,' Mr Bohm said.
Another union official said an offer at the steel talks of an investment
package might prompt fresh negotiations between Gesamtmetall and the metal
and electrical employees. Mr Dieter Kirchner, Gesamtmetall's chairman, was
in Berlin earlier this week where he raised the possibility of discussions
to break the deadlock with IG Metall.
Both employers associations want a 9 per cent pay increase in east Germany.
In a recent poll, Gesamtmetall claimed, three quarters of canvassed workers
said they would accept this increase if it meant the survival of their
enterprises.
Steelworkers marched on North Rhine-Westphalia's state legislature yesterday
to protest against the planned closure of a Krupp steel mill in the heart of
Germany's Ruhr industrial region, Reuter reports from Dusseldorf.

<TEXT>
BCE, the international telecommunications group, is exchanging its common
and convertible preferred shares of Encor, a lossmaking oil and gas
development and production company in western Canada, for 18.6 per cent of
Talisman, the former BP Canada.
The 12m new Talisman common shares being issued to BCE have a market value
of almost CDollars 240m (USDollars 192m).
The deal is part of a merger between Talisman and Encor, formerly the
exploration and production arm of TransCanada PipeLines. BCE now holds 18.6m
Encor common shares and all Encor's convertible preferred stock.
BCE said the merger would create a stronger oil and gas group. But analysts
expect it to eventually sell the Talisman holding. Under the merger,
Talisman offers one of its common shares trading at just under CDollars 20
for every 60 Encor common shares.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (4): Control across
multiple projects - Application area / Financial Information Services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS ONE of the world's largest information services groups, CCN relies on
information technology (IT) systems at the centre of its business. But IT
projects are among the most difficult to manage, and it was to control a
dozen different project areas, and multiple projects within them, that CCN
first acquired Hoskyns' PMW tool, writes Claire Gooding.
CCN's main customers are banks, building societies, credit card, finance and
mail order companies, which rely on CCN information for credit management
and marketing decisions. The company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great
Universal Stores, with a turnover of Pounds 67m.
Of a staff of 1,500 worldwide, 350 work in IT, and some are full-time
project managers. Delivering to time and cost was a big concern, and needed
more than hand-drawn charts. In 1987, when Alec Dawson, director of systems
development, started looking for a project management system, there was a
need to manage several client projects simultaneously. He looked at five
different products, but found that there was very little available for
running on PCs at the time: most needed mainframe hosts.
One product was rejected for being too closely aligned with engineering and
construction. And another, Wings, although functionally rich, had an
uncertain future.
PMW is now used to control costs and track staff deployment across multiple
projects. With 27 licences, and as many as 45 individual users, CCN invested
in tailored training, provided by Hoskyns - 'PMW has been of big assistance
to us in bringing in our projects on time and within cost,' explains Alec
Dawson. 'Previously, we were finding it increasingly difficult to achieve
this with paper and pencil.' Another advantage is that the use of the
software has standardised communication between teams, and enabled a quicker
response to change - 'having the ability to change project plans quickly and
easily has allowed managers to identify and focus on key issues much faster
than when they used manual methods.'
To get the best out of PMW, CCN had first to put effort into organising its
own disciplines. Mr Dawson's advice is that standards have to be set,
in-house.
'You must have a set of standards for describing resources and tasks which
are present in all projects - for example, SP for a senior programmer, and
implementing it across the company,' he says.
'The training was very much tailored to teaching our specific standards, not
just PMW methodology.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia inaugurates second
joint-venture diamond polishing factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S SECOND joint-venture diamond polishing factory was inaugurated
yesterday as part of an effort to modernise the country's stone-cutting
industry.
The Intertrade joint venture is 60 per cent owned by a Moscow city-owned
construction organisation and Russia's Committee for Precious Stones and
Metals. The rest is owned by Belgium's Kaszirer Diamonds and Oltuski Spira
Diamonds, which have invested some USDollars 6-Dollars 7m in the project.
Western diamond experts said that Kaszirer had been suspended from De Beers'
Central Selling Organisation last year in connection with its purchases of
rough diamonds from the Committee for Precious Metals and Stones. De Beers
has a five year agreement with Russia expiring in 1995 under which the
Russians can sell only 5 per cent of their rough diamond output on
international markets. But they are free to sell diamonds for domestic
diamond-cutters.
Mr Anatoly Kondrashev, Intertrade's deputy director, said the factory had
started operating in November but that the official opening had been delayed
until yesterday so that the joint venture could show off its achievements
after a few months work. The Moscow factory, employing 100 people, aimed to
process up to 450,000 carats of rough gems a year.
He said the joint venture also wanted further down the line to contract
other Russian diamond-cutting factories to cut rough stones for it. 'We have
more capacity to sell than we have to cut,' Mr Kondrashev said. He said the
factory was paying dollars for stones provided by the Committee for Precious
Metals and Stones. It would sell the polished diamonds it produced in
Belgium.
The other diamond-cutting joint venture is an Israeli-Russian venture called
Ruisdiamond, which has imported western equipment and is teaching Russian
workers to polish the most difficult type of rough stone. But while
Intertrade is partly-owned by the Committee of Precious Metals, Ruisdiamond
is close to Almazy Rossii-Sakha, the Russian state diamond producing
conglomerate. The latter's president, Mr Valery Rudakov, then head of the
old Soviet gold and diamonds conglomerate, was involved in concluding the
1990 agreement with De Beers in return for which the Soviet Union got a
Dollars 1bn dollar loan.

WD &amp; HO Wills Holdings, the Australian tobacco group 67 per cent owned by
BAT, said net profits after abnormal items rose 249 per cent to ADollars 32m
(USDollars 22m) in 1992.
Sales rose 12.7 per cent to ADollars 834m, resulting in a 15 per cent
increase in the group's share of the Australian market, which is slowly
shrinking.
The result was struck after an abnormal loss of ADollars 10.3m, reflecting
restructuring costs, and a write-down of property assets to recoverable
values.
The directors declared a fully-franked final dividend of 9 cents a share,
compared with 3 cents a year earlier, making a full-year dividend of 12
cents.
Sagasco, the Australian energy group, yesterday said net profits increased
by 8 per cent to a record ADollars 52.5m in 1992, on turnover up 6.7 per
cent to ADollars 380.6m. The final dividend was 8 cents, making a total of
14.5 cents fully franked, up from 13 cents. AWA, the Australian electronics
group, has blamed a downturn in defence sales for an interim net loss of
ADollars 4.9m in the first half to December, against an interim net profit
of ADollars 3.8m in the same period of the previous year.

<TEXT>
LIBERTY LIFE, South Africa's largest listed life insurance company, reported
a 22 per cent rise in per-share earnings to 155 cents for 1992, from 127
cents the year before.
Liberty - which has close ties with TransAtlantic, the UK listed financial
services group, and UAP, the leading French insurer - increased total income
before tax by 23 per cent to R4.85bn (Dollars 1.5bn) from R3.94bn.
This consisted of a 31 per cent increase in net premium income and annuity
considerations to R2.98bn from R2.27bn, and a 13 per cent increase in
investment income to R1.88bn from R1.66bn.
New annualised recurring premiums, a key benchmark of growth in the
industry, rose by 22 per cent to R577m from R474m, against the background of
a shrinking South African economy. Total new business was 36 per cent up at
R1.7bn against R1.25bn. The dividend, declared last month, rose to 132 cents
per share from 108 cents.
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said he was confident the group would maintain
20 per cent growth in earnings during 1993. Shareholders' capital at the
year end amounted to R8.5bn against R8.1bn a year earlier and total assets
came to R35.7bn compared with R34.5bn.
Mr Gordon said the group had three main aims for the next three to five
years.
They were: increasing its exposure to the UK insurance sector through
TransAtlantic; consolidating UK property interests held via Capital and
Counties, a TransAtlantic subsidiary, probably involving 'another major
acquisition'; and a 'significant' acquisition of a North American life
insurer.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Empire-builder sets up his Wall
St dream - Sanford Weill's bid for the Shearson broking business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a certain symmetry to the news this week that legendary Wall
Street dealmaker Mr Sanford Weill is negotiating to buy the Shearson stock
brokerage operations from American Express.
After all, it was the buccaneering Mr Weill who built the Shearson empire
from scratch during the 1970s, and who sold it to American Express in 1981.
It was also Mr Weill who resigned as president of American Express in 1985
after two difficult years as the second-in-command to chief executive Mr Jim
Robinson. And it was the same Mr Weill who attempted to buy back Shearson in
1990, only to see his plans fall apart at the eleventh hour.
Now Mr Weill is on the verge of realising a long-cherished dream of creating
a Wall Street brokerage powerhouse to challenge the biggest in the US
securities industry. In rescuing Shearson from its troubled parent, he is
returning to his roots and exacting a small measure of revenge for the
frustrating years he spent at American Express.
If the negotiations are concluded successfully, Mr Weill will merge Shearson
into the Smith Barney broking operation of his diversified financial
services company, Primerica. The new entity will have more than 11,000
brokers, almost 500 branches, combined revenues of over Dollars 13bn, and
will rival Merrill Lynch as the country's largest securities firm.
The acquisition of Shearson should cement Mr Weill's reputation as one of
the pre-eminent empire-builders on Wall Street.
The Brooklyn-born Mr Weill, displayed his ambitions at an early age. In
1960, five years after starting on Wall Street as a Dollars 65-a-week
trading clerk and at the age of just 27, he set up his own securities firm
with three friends.
Over the next two decades Mr Weill's business expanded rapidly. In 1974, the
firm, then named Hayden Stone, bought Shearson Hammill, doubling in size. In
1979, it acquired Loeb Rhoades, and by the start of the 1980s the firm,
known by then as Shearson, was the second-largest securities brokerage in
the US.
In 1981, Mr Weill, believing broking houses would only prosper if they were
backed by large amounts of capital, sold Shearson to American Express for
Dollars 930m. The sale made him a fortune, and provided him with a senior
position at the travel and financial services giant.
Although he became the group's president within two years, the aggressive,
entrepreneurial Mr Weill never fitted into the American Express bureaucratic
corporate culture, and in 1985 he left the company. After an abortive
attempt to take over BankAmerica, he briefly concentrated his energies on
fund-raising (he was the prime force behind the Dollars 60m restoration of
Carnegie Hall in New York).
It did not take long for Mr Weill to return to the fray. His next vehicle
was the ailing financing group Commercial Credit, which he bought cheaply
from Control Data in 1986. Two years later, he used it to launch a
successful Dollars 1.5bn takeover bid for Primerica. Along with Primerica,
Mr Weill got the retail brokerage house Smith Barney - he was back in the
business he knew best.
Under Mr Weill, Primerica has thrived. Its earnings have grown at a compound
rate of between 25 per cent and 30 per cent, and the shares have almost
tripled in value. Today, the company has three main businesses: the consumer
finance arm Commercial Credit, the financial services unit which sells term
insurance and mutual funds to middle-income families, and Smith Barney.
All three divisions are profitable, which has much to do with Mr Weill's
vigorous approach to managing costs. Last year, the consumer finance
business brought in Dollars 193.5m, the insurance business Dollars 187.3m,
and the brokerage Dollars 170m. Primerica's total operating earnings in 1992
were a record Dollars 593m.
Mr Weill has been busy in the past year. Keen to concentrate Primerica's
energies on its three core businesses, he recently completed the sale of the
group's interests in the mail order company Fingerhut and the credit insurer
Voyager.
Then, last autumn, Primerica paid Dollars 772.5m for a 27 per cent stake in
the lossmaking insurance group, Travelers, which Mr Weill is now helping to
turn around. The deal was typical of Mr Weill - he paid Dollars 19 a share
for a big holding in a company with a book value of Dollars 40 a share.
Since his arrival, Travelers' stock has risen from under Dollars 17 to
almost Dollars 30.
Now, the proposed Shearson deal is winning Mr Weill new praise. Mr Perrin
Long, of First Michigan, who has followed Mr Weill's career closely over the
past three decades, says: 'I think it's a good deal for Sandy - he would
acquire for Dollars 1bn something that would have cost him much more than
Dollars 1bn to build from ground zero.'
The acquisition would fit the pattern of most of Mr Weill's previous deals.
As Mr Long explains: 'Generally, he has gone after companies that are
basically over the hill . . . This is the Sandy way of doing things. He will
take the best of Smith Barney and the best of Shearson and put the two
together. Anything that is not the best gets left at the kerb.'
Although Shearson has its problems (in particular, its costs have been
rising faster than earnings), Mr Weill is likely to leave the most troubled
parts of the business - the struggling Lehman investment banking division,
the bad property investments and the legal liabilities - with American
Express.
Analysts believe the remainder should fit nicely with Smith Barney, once the
costs of the newly-combined business have been scaled back.
There is plenty of room for savings, says Mr Long: 'There is a considerable
amount of fat in the top layers of Shearson, and there are a number of
departments where trimming could take place, particularly in the back
office.'
If all goes well, Mr Weill has once again pulled off a smart deal. As Mr
John Keefe, an independent analyst with Keefe Worldwide, says: 'I think
Shearson is a great operation. It has a good customer base, a productive
broker force, and good products they sell to people. It just needs a little
extra management.'

MASTERCARD, the US credit card company, has filed a lawsuit in a New York
federal court accusing American Express of using 'false and misleading'
advertising to promote its American Express corporate credit card.
The MasterCard legal action, which seeks to block three American Express
advertisements, also seeks financial damages.
MasterCard alleged in its court action that American Express was not telling
the truth in one advertisement in which it claimed its corporate card was
superior to other cards because there were no late fees or other charges.
American Express, according to the suit, does assess penalties for overdue
payments.
Ms Christine Levite, of American Express, claimed there was no merit to the
lawsuit.
Mr Parker Bagley, a lawyer for MasterCard, said the suit was filed after
American Express declined a request to withdraw the offending
advertisements.
General Motors, which has issued more than 5m MasterCard-based GM credit
cards since launching the non-bank card last September, said it was
launching a Visa-based GM card in the Canadian market.
The card will be issued under an agreement between General Motors of Canada
and Toronto Dominion Bank.

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Currency loss helps push SAS
into the red for third consecutive year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) yesterday reported a SKr743m (Dollars
97.4m) pre-tax loss for 1992, its third consecutive year in the red, and
said it expected another difficult year in 1993.
The airline's chief executive, Mr Jan Carlzon, told a news conference that
SAS would have to team with another European airline in order to survive,
although he described the 1992 results as 'a fair result in a tough sector'.
'We think in the future we will . . . keep our heads above water, but we
need to get into the big five in Europe and to make large structural changes
by 1995,' Mr Carlzon said.
The deficit had been expected after the airline revealed in January that its
result would be hit by a one-off SKr1.2bn currency loss as a result of the
devaluation of the krona.
SAS expected 'some improvement' in its pre-tax result this year, although it
foresaw 'continued slow market growth with mounting pressures from increased
competition and lower fares.'
The airline is currently discussing extensive strategic collaboration
arrangements with KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines.
SAS said its operating result rose SKr213m to SKr2.93bn as revenues
increased 7 per cent to SKr34.4bn in spite of difficult market conditions.
It increased market share in many European countries, with sales rising
SKr986m to SKr22.7bn. However, SAS noted that many important markets, and
Sweden in particular, were still in recession and its traffic growth of 2
per cent was far below the European average of 13 per cent.
The group suffered from lower fares, caused by intense competition and the
deregulation of the Swedish market.
However, falling yields within SAS, SAS International Hotels and SAS Leisure
were offset by the group's extensive rationalisation programme. The airline
plans to cut operating costs by a further 20 to 25 per cent over the next
three years.
SAS airline saw profits before extraordinary items fall to SKr25m last year
from SKr1.04bn in 1991, but the group's hotel operations posted much reduced
losses of SKr135m, compared with SKr1.02bn.

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Klockner-Werke unveils
debt-relief plan
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLOCKNER-WERKE, the German steel and engineering group, yesterday revealed
the conditions it is offering creditors under a debt-relief scheme.
Creditors would receive profit-entitlement warrants which would grant them
one-third of the distributable profits of the company, including those from
its non-steel divisions.
The company had earlier said that the 'composition' procedure filed against
creditors last December, a legal move which is one step short of bankruptcy
proceedings, would not affect its non-steel division, which makes plastics
and engineering products.
Under the plan, one-third of profits made by the whole company would be
distributed to creditors for eight years. Creditors would receive only up to
50 per cent of the debt which they had agreed to cancel.
However, creditors would be entitled to only 30 per cent of the debt they
had agreed to cancel if a capital increase occurred over the next eight
years. Mr Hans Christoph von Rohr, chief executive of Klockner Werke, said
that a capital increase was 'an open possibility' for 1994, depending on
market conditions.
Creditors would also be entitled to receive 75 per cent of any extraordinary
income raised from the restructuring of the steel divisions.
Such income could come from the sale of steel assets. The company is
negotiating the sale of its Georgsmarienhutte plant, but no details were
revealed yesterday.
Mr von Rohr added that the debt-relief plan would save the steel
subsidiaries DM150m a year in interest payments. He added that the scheme
called for the closure of the Bremer blast furnace in Bremen, reducing the
the company's steel production by 20 per cent
The debt-relief scheme was presented to local courts in Duisburg, where the
company is based.
Mr von Rohr said yesterday creditors would meet at the end of May to review
the plan. He added he was confident the plan would get the required 80 per
cent approval from creditors. Talks with Deutsche Bank, the company's
principal creditor, and WestLB, the state bank in North Rhine-Westphalia,
are continuing.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Technology: Keeping good time on the slopes - Ian Rodger
discovers a novel method of gaining access to ski lifts which may pave the
way for other security devices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alpine skiers may not yet realise it, but they may have contributed to the
improvement of our quality of life, our security and perhaps even our
health.
This hitherto unsung and unknown achievement arises from the familiar
phenomenon of a restless inventor noticing a problem and trying to find a
solution for it.
The problem - one which every alpine skier will recognise - is gaining
access to ski lifts. Traditionally, ski resorts issue lift passes which
skiers keep in their pockets.
On approaching lift turnstiles, they have to drop their ski sticks, take off
their gloves, fish about in their pockets for the cards, pick up their
sticks and gloves and slide towards the turnstile holding the cards up for
the attendants to check or to slide into a validation slot.
This procedure is awkward and time consuming and various inventors have
tried to improve it.
Perhaps the simplest and most popular solution is a small locket with a
spring-loaded cord. One end is attached to the skier's jacket and the other
to the lift pass. Thus, the card is always available and can be pulled out
quickly and easily to a validation slot.
Its only disadvantages are that the card flaps distractingly on the piste
and, even though the cards are made of tough laminates, there is the danger
that they can be wrenched off and lost in a bad fall. For a one or two-week
pass, the cost of replacement is painfully high.
In the past couple of years, more ambitious radio-electronic systems have
appeared. The most popular of these, now installed at some 150 resorts
around the world, was developed by the Skidata subsidiary of Austria's
Constantia, the diversified industrial group. It is based on a wrist watch,
the so-called Key Watch, which, in addition to being a digital watch, can
store data in various forms and can transmit a signal that opens a turnstile
or lock.
The idea is that the skier buys the Key Watch for roughly Dollars 80 (Pounds
56). Each time he or she goes to a resort that has the system, the watch can
be programmed by the resort operator to provide access to lifts for whatever
length of time the skier intends to stay at the resort.
As the watch is expensive, the Skidata system continues to allow customers
to buy and use the conventional access cards and this remains the norm for
day-trippers. But skiers are obviously impressed by the watch's convenience.
Since introducing the system in the 1990-91 season, Skidata has sold more
than 80,000.
While that has been gratifying for Constantia, the group also quickly saw
that the system could have many applications other than at ski resorts. As a
result, it has smothered the Key Watch with patents and installed automatic
destruction devices in them to prevent snooping by would-be copiers.
The technologies used to link the watch and the turnstile or lock provide it
with a number of interesting characteristics. It can be made owner-secure,
with the addition of a personal identification number that can only be seen
by an authorised reader. It is also reprogrammable. Thus, it could be used
to identify employees in a laboratory or factory or delegates at a
high-security conference.
It is already used in a few commercial parking garages in much the same way
as at ski resorts. It is also used in some hotels instead of bedroom and
function room keys. Other possibilities include authorisation of fund
transfers.
'Our aim is to increase the uses of the watch so that it becomes more
worthwhile for people to buy it,' says Ernst Strohmeier, Skidata's executive
vice-president of finance. Some Constantia officials are excited about the
potential, conjuring up thoughts of it being used to deliver data on body
functions to doctors at remote locations and similar futuristic ideas.
But Strohmeier is more cautious. 'If you talk to 10 people, you can get 20
new ideas. The important thing is to find applications that are not just
interesting, but that really improve a function and which can be
profitable.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Cuts urged in tobacco and alcohol taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, yesterday faced growing demands for a cut
in excise duties on alcohol and tobacco in next week's Budget.
A report from the free-market Adam Smith Institute said present 'excessive'
rates of taxation are costing the economy Pounds 20bn a year. 'If the
chancellor wants to close his budget deficit he should be reducing taxes on
alcohol and tobacco, not putting them up,' it said.
At Westminster an all party group of MPs protested against 'unfair taxation'
of Scotch whisky and other spirits, while the Brewers Society said beer
sales fell last year to their lowest level since 1970. It called for a
staged reduction in 'the unacceptable tax burden on the British beer
drinker'.
High taxes combined with the recession depressed beer production to 32.25m
barrels, a decline of 3 per cent or 800,000 pints a day, the society said.
'The prospects for 1993 are far from good as the flood of duty-paid imports
from France continues to undermine British pubs, off-licences and jobs,' the
society added.
Within two months of the start of the single market duty-paid imports were
already equivalent to almost 10 per cent of beer drunk at home, the society
said.
The Adam Smith Institute report, by Mr Barry Bracewell-Milnes, a tax
economist, suggested that the economic loss from alcohol taxation because of
the distortion of competition amounted to Pounds 7.57bn a year. That was
equivalent to a quarter of the gains expected from membership of the
European single market.
Because UK duties were so high - 13 times the amount of VAT on a bottle of
spirits - consumers sought to avoid them by shopping abroad, Mr
Bracewell-Milnes said. Retailers in south-east England were facing ruin and
the chancellor's tax-base was shrinking as a result.
He said that while the chancellor might still be better off by putting 1p on
a pint of beer, he could raise an extra Pounds 1.22bn by slashing the tax on
spirits by 60 per cent. He could also gain a little extra by reducing tax on
wine.
He added that the government should welcome any opportunity to move to a
lower-duty regime. Alcohol and tobacco taxes hit poorer families harder than
the well-off and were inefficient tools for attempting to improve public
health - 'like trying to reduce road accidents by doubling the price of
petrol'.
Scottish and Newcastle Breweries is to axe 270 management and staff jobs in
Scotland and northern England in the next six months.

FT  11 MAR 93 / NKK's workforce to be reduced by 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NKK, the Japanese steel company, is to reduce its workforce by 15 per cent
over the next three years and slash capital spending by 40 per cent by 1995
NKK is the country's first steel company to announce a major restructuring
programme. Other groups in the industry, which face rising costs due to
heavy capital investments in the late 1980s, are expected to follow suit.
The company plans to cut staff by transferring workers to affiliates. While
most Japanese companies are reducing staff by targeting older workers, NKK
said its plan included younger staff members. It also said it would cut
divisions in new businesses other than steel which were unprofitable.
Japanese steel makers drafted restructurings in the mid-1980s, when demand
for steel plunged.  They abandoned them later in the decade in response to
the rapid growth in the economy. The low cost of capital further contributed
to heavy capital investments.
Despite the recent spate of shakeouts announced by large Japanese companies,
leading think tanks predict corporate Japan will face the first fourth
consecutive decline in pre-tax earnings in postwar history.
Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura Securities, said
yesterday corporate profits, excluding the financial sector, for the
business year ending March 1994 would fall 4.8 per cent.
Nomura said manufacturing industry will post a 5.6 per cent pre-tax profit
fall, but non-manufacturers will see a 2.6 per cent profit rise. Profits for
all industries for the first half to September are projected to fall 10.4
per cent, while effects of the government's increased public works spending
package are expected to start emerging during the second half, lifting
pre-tax profits by 9.2 per cent.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Rail interests' merger derailed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN cartel office has derailed a plan for two of Germany's biggest
engineering groups to merge their railway businesses in a joint venture.
Siemens and AEG, the Daimler-Benz subsidiary, will now discuss 'partial
collaboration' and make new proposals aimed at overcoming the competition
authorities' objections, Siemens Verkehrstechnik said yesterday.
The would-be partners had not been surprised by the decision, the company
added. It was too soon to be specific, but one fruitful area could be closer
co-operation in manufacturing high-speed train rolling stock.
The Berlin-based cartel office rejected the merger plan on the grounds that
the new company would dominate the domestic market.
The companies first asked the office if it had any basic objections to
co-operation in late November, and followed up a month later with its
joint-venture proposal.
AEG sells around DM1.6bn (Pounds 670m) of locomotives and rolling stock a
year. The Siemens business, which also includes stakes in the rail divisions
of Krupp and Krauss Maffei, has around DM2.7bn annual turnover.
Both businesses are profitable and are expected to benefit greatly from the
long-term project to merge west and east German railway networks while at
the same time upgrading the whole of the former GDR system.
At present the federal railway authorities buy almost exclusively from
domestic suppliers. However, the German rail engineering industry leaders
were keen to form a single company, the better to compete in international
markets with groups such as GEC-Alsthom and ABB.
Siemens, which pulled together its rail interests into a new rail technology
division only three years ago, already has several international
co-operation agreements, including one with Ansaldo in Italy.
Bosch-Siemens, the kitchen appliances company, has taken over the small
appliances division of Gorenje, the Slovenian white goods maker.
Small appliances account for around 10 per cent of the German group's DM7bn
annual sales, and for 7 per cent of Gorenje's DM1bn turnover.
The price was not disclosed, although Bosch-Siemens said it planned to
invest DM35m in its new acquisition over the next few years.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK treaty ratification faces further obstacles

THE UK GOVERNMENT faces a further setback in its attempt to push ahead with
ratification of the Maastricht treaty, a senior Conservative cabinet
minister conceded yesterday.
The opposition Labour party believes it could gain enough support from the
Liberal Democratic party and Tory rebels to win five further amendments to
the bill, each aimed at enhancing democratic accountability and controls
over the EC. Although none of the amendments would halt British ratification
of the treaty, they would undoubtedly serve to undermine further the
government's authority and sap morale among loyalist pro-Maastricht MPs.
In an attempt to talk down the significance of Monday's defeat in the House
of Commons, when Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative party rebels
scored a 22-vote victory over the government, the minister said: 'The ship
can take on some water. So long as it stays on course, that is what
matters.'
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, is also understood to have taken a
strategic decision not to antagonise Tory Euro-rebels, believing many are
fighting over what they see as genuine points of principle.
With the committee stage set to resume today, possibly continuing into the
weekend, Mr Major is anxious to maintain Conservative unity in the long
term, not least in nine months time when the Maastricht legislation should
be passed.
In practice, recent surveys of Conservative constituency association
chairmen - showing many supportive of the rebels - reveal there is little he
can do to contain the revolt.
Ministers appear ready to leave the arm-twisting to loyalist backbench
colleagues who are expected to resume their criticisms of the rebels today.
But leaders of the Euro-sceptics were unbowed yesterday, saying they could
support at least some of Labour's amendments. Although there is evidence of
some splits among the rebels, tactics are also being kept secret.
The government's vulnerability has, meanwhile, markedly raised morale on the
Labour benches following its 22-vote victory on Monday. But Mr John Smith,
the Labour party leader, yesterday made clear that the opposition will do
nothing to prevent eventual ratification of the accord.
He spoke against an amendment proposed yesterday, at a meeting of the
parliamentary Labour party, that he warned could wreck the treaty.
Mr Davies's motion, that attempts to reject the treaty's provisions on
member states' budget deficits, was rejected by the overwhelming margin of
94 votes to 35 - solidly confirming support for Mr Smith's stance among his
backbenchers.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Senate's approval near for Brazil tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB

<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian Senate was set yesterday to approve a new tax on financial
transactions, after reassurances from the finance minister that the
government is planning no shock measures.
Government officials were predicting a smooth passage for the tax, having
overcome a credibility crisis provoked by the nomination last week of Mr
Eliseu Resende as Brazil's third finance minister in five months.
He had held public office during the military regime of 1964-85, when he was
behind some huge and costly development projects now considered white
elephants, such as the Transamazonica - a road through the Amazonian rain
forest.
The optimism yesterday arose from a positive reaction to promises by Mr
Resende in his six-hour address to the Senate late on Tuesday. He said that,
in the fight against inflation, there would be no shock measures such as a
price freeze, devaluation or compulsory lengthening of terms on Treasury
bonds.
The minister reiterated the need for the new tax. It was a 'hole-filler of
the utmost importance,' he said. The 0.25 per cent levy on cheques and
financial transactions is expected to raise the equivalent of an extra
Dollars 600m per month, essential for government attempts to balance its
budget.
Mr Resende reaffirmed that the government intends to use Dollars 4bn of the
extra revenue to pay off half of the domestic debt titles which fall due
this year. However, the tax cannot take effect until a supplementary law has
been enacted.
Yesterday, the financial markets had their calmest day for weeks, relieved
by the minister's assurances and by the choice as Central Bank governor of
Mr Paulo Cesar Ximenes, Brazil's representative at the Inter-American
Development Bank in Washington.

FT  11 MAR 93 / French cabinet backs reform of constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday put its stamp of approval on President
Francois Mitterrand's proposed constitutional reform aimed at giving
France's legislature and judiciary more independence from its executive.
The proposals, which will go to parliament for discussion after this month's
elections, are designed to boost the powers of scrutiny of the relatively
weak National Assembly as well as to give it more leeway to organise its own
business.
However, it proposes that parliament should sit for a single session from
October to June each year rather than its current two sessions of 90 days
each.
The only mildly controversial element is Mr Mitterrand's call for the
scrapping of Article 16 which gives a president extraordinary powers in a
national emergency.
The Conseil d'Etat, which advises the government on constitutional matters,
counselled against abolishing this article, even though it has only been
used once - by General de Gaulle during the Algerian troubles in the early
1960s.
In the present political climate virtually the only constitutional issue of
interest to most French is the president's term of office.
Mr Mitterrand had hinted that he might call for presidential terms to be
shortened from seven years, or made non-renewable.
However, the plan approved yesterday follows an early advisory committee in
recommending no change to this issue which has sparked wide political
debate.
The Union for French Democracy (UDF), led by ex-President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing who believes in reducing the tenure of a French president,
yesterday took for the first time a slight lead over its Republican Rally
(RPR) Gaullist ally in an opinion poll.
An IFOP survey gave the UDF 20 per cent, the RPR 19.5 per cent, with the
ruling Socialist party trailing at 22 per cent.

ASHTON Mining, the Australian diamond and gold producer 46 per cent owned by
Malaysia Mining Corp, has posted record net profits of ADollars 35.38m
(USDollars 25)for 1992, up from ADollars 21.04m a year earlier, Reuter
reports from Melbourne.
Earnings per share rose to 12.65 cents from 7.50 cents and the final
dividend is set at 4 cents a share, making 8 cents for the year, up from 7
cents. Sales advanced to ADollars 287.10 from ADollars 250.63m.
Mr John Robinson, chief executive, said the diamond business was attracting
wide interest, primarily because of a large discovery in the Northwest
Territories of Canada last year by its joint venture with Broken Hill
Proprietary.
Diamonds accounted for 71 per cent of Ashton's 1992 sales compared with 100
per cent in 1987 when the group was starting to diversify into gold.
Mr Robinson said 1993 profits would depend on the level of diamond sales to
the Central Selling Organisation, the De Beers-controlled company.

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Paramount suffers sharp fall to
Dollars 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER operating earnings from its entertainment division and seasonal losses
in publishing caused a sharp decline in net profits at Paramount
Communications during the first quarter of fiscal 1993 ended January 31.
The company had first- quarter net income of less than Dollars 1m, or 1 cent
per share, compared with Dollars 18.4m, or 16 cents in the first three
months of fiscal 1992.
Paramount's revenues also declined, to Dollars 943.7m in the quarter from
Dollars 1.07bn a year earlier.
Paramount said the weak performance of film releases in the quarter resulted
in lower operating income, despite higher contributions from television
programming operations.
Entertainment results in the first quarter also reflected lower operating
income from television broadcast stations and theatrical exhibition
operations, as well as a decline in earnings at Madison Square Garden in New
York.
Paramount also said its theme parks division, acquired in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1992, suffered a small loss in the latest reporting period.
Publishing losses in the quarter were about equal to the corresponding
period last year.
Looking ahead, Paramount said it expected earnings momentum to build in the
second half of the year, led by strength in education and consumer
publishing and a recovery on the entertainment side.
On Wall Street, Paramount's share price was Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars
50.

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cruise operator plans flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Caribbean Cruises, one of the largest cruise ship operators in the US,
is coming to the stock market.
The Miami-based company made its 'initial public offering' filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday.
It did not detail the precise timing for the flotation, nor the number of
shares to be offered. However, it did register 9.08m shares at a proposed
maximum offering price of Dollars 19 a share, and said the proceeds would be
used to repay secured debt facilities. Anything remaining would go for
'general purposes'.
Royal Caribbean was formed in the late 1960s by three Norwegian shipping
companies - I. M. Skaugen, Gotaas Larsen and Anders Wilhelmsen - and merged
with Admiral Cruises in 1988. That year, Anders Wilhelmsen bought out the
other partners, and then set up a joint ownership arrangement with interests
related to Chicago's Pritzker family. Today, Royal Caribbean operates nine
ships - a number of which are part of the current generation of
'mega-ships,' sleeping over 2,000 passengers.
The cruise industry has fared better than most leisure-related sectors
during the recession, with the number of people taking cruises increasing by
about 10 per cent a year.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Arts: With spring in their steps / Review of young dancers
at the Paris Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dancer's life is short, and youthful promise has a nasty habit of fading
away, either by reason of neglect or because of the pressures within a
ballet company. The golden gift we saw at graduation - or thought we saw -
turns to some baser material as time passes, and occasional soloist roles
are the reward for what once seemed a talent to storm the heights. The Paris
Opera Ballet has in latter years set aside evenings in the Palais Garnier to
celebrate the potential of its youngest dancers, so that the Paris public
(always very partisan) may judge the gifted young, and the gifted young may
have moments of glory as a reward for talent, and a taste of greater rewards
to come.
The evenings are tremendously exciting. A clue to the Opera's dance style
lies in display, in assured prowess, in the assertion of 'moi'. Some years
ago, in Natalia Makarova's Ballerina series for BBC TV, shots of class at
the Opera superb Ballet School found the teacher urging her girls to show
plus de chic; beaucoup plus de chic. It is a phrase which sums up a lot
about attitudes at the school and in the company. Technique, the
presentation of the dance, is glossy, and has that wit which is an essential
component of chic. Russian young can look soulful (though sublime) by
comparison. Americans may appear hard-driven in attack; the English somewhat
demure. Most of the young French, if not all - as I saw on Saturday night -
take the stage with an allure that speaks of confidence and a clear sense of
their identity. At worst they are over-vivacious: at best they are
world-beaters.
The programme, given on three successive evenings, comprised pas de deux and
extracts from the repertory. All may not have been for the best all the time
 -a version of the Fairy variations from the Sleeping Beauty prologue did no
justice to Petipa, for the Russian classics lie outside the Opera's
traditions; Agon is not for the inexperienced - but the sum effect was of a
company (and a teaching tradition) marvellously rich.
There were several exceptional talents. A duet from Le Papillon with
Isabelle Ciavara (aged 20) and Emmanuel Thibault (just 18) was
heart-touching. Mlle Ciavara is slight, enchantingly pretty, and delights in
the intricacies of quick, clear, tiny steps: the old Russian ballerinas used
to call such choreography 'weaving lace with your feet'. Mlle Ciavara turns,
holds a floating pose, is sweetly true in this reconstruction of a mid-19th
century spectacle. M Thibault is of medium height - Baryshnikov, Julio
Bocca, his models - and already possessor of a beautifully rounded
technique. Marvels are easily done, but more enthralling is his ability to
devour space, to race and soar, and seem a meteor. Like Mlle Ciaravola, his
manner is still innocent; I long to see them both in Coppelia.
A grand contrast came with Aurelie Dupont in Balanchine's Tchaikovsky pas de
deux. Winner of the junior gold medal in last year's Varna Ballet
Competition, she has an all-conquering skill, but it is allied to a
lusciousness of pose (her back, torso, have a fluidity and power more
Russian than French) and to an innate musical sensibility. Her manner is
serious - if she flirts with anything, it is with the phrasing of the dance,
and that she does divinely - and I hope the world will be hers, for she
seems destined for great things. She had as companion the young but already
established, and splendid, Nicolas Le Riche, hero of the recent house
revival of Le Train Bleu. The pas de deux was radiant.
Ghislaine Fallou is another exceptional talent. She, too, revealed a dignity
of presence, a lovely clarity of pose and grace of phrasing. She needed all
these to redeem Ben Stevenson's Three Preludes in which she was trapped with
her partner, the elegant Yann Bridart. The dance amounts to hollow emotings
to Rakhmaninov - it is a faked choreographic orgasm - but these devoted
artists gave the movement a sincerity which redounds enormously to their
credit. Another rescue operation was performed by Delphine Baey and Emmanuel
Hoff in the duet from William Forsythe's In the middle. Mlle Baey produced
the dead-pan force, the far-flung limbs and the general air of aggressive
boredom that the piece demands. I would love to see her in a ballet: she is
a physically dramatic dancer, excellently matched by M. Hoff.
There were other young performers on view, their moments of glory well
merited. How good to see a great national troupe able and willing to salute
its next generation. It is worth urging any visitor to Paris to the Matisse
show at the Beaubourg, where you can see the Petersburg version of La Danse,
as thrilling as the activities of the apprentice angels at the Palais
Garnier.
The Paris Opera Ballet will be on tour at the Kennedy Center, Washington,
March 18-28. Sponsored by AROP, the Florence Gould Foundation, American
