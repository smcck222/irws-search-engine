FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Candover assets up 9% but new activity
halves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANDOVER Investments, an investment trust specialising in management
buy-outs, increased net assets per share and pre-tax profits in 1992 but saw
a halving of its new investment activity.
Mr Roger Brooke, chairman, said it would take only a modest economic
recovery to produce a significant increase in the value of Candover's
investments, but it remained difficult to read the UK economy,
The sharp decline in interest rates would, however, make it considerably
more difficult to maintain income levels from the company's cash and
investments in short-term securities this year, he warned.
Net assets per share rose by 9 per cent to 267p in the year ended December
1992 while fully diluted earnings per share rose 12 per cent to 13.7p.
Candover proposes to pay a final dividend of 6.5p, making a total of 10.25p,
an increase of 8 per cent.
Pre-tax profits rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 4.1m. Because the tax charge
was smaller than expected, profits after tax rose by 11 per cent to Pounds
3.15m.
Net assets increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 59.8m to show annual compound
growth of 22 per cent in the eight years since Candover was listed.
The FT-A All-Share Index has risen 14.3 per cent a year over the same
period.
Candover was cautious about making investments in 1992 because of
uncertainty about when the recession would end, while many companies
deferred disposing of non-core activities by means of a buy-out in the hope
they could obtain a better price by waiting.
The result of this was to reduce total investments by Candover and its
managed funds to Pounds 45.8m from Pounds 89.8m in 1991.
Candover still had Pounds 100m available in its two main funds and so did
not have to think seriously about raising new finance, Mr Brooke said.
Germany, which accounts for half of Candover's non-UK investments or 5 per
cent of its total assets, has been a cause of concern.
Candover's shares rose 5p to 253p.

<TEXT>
TRANSFER Technology, the specialist engineering group, increased pre-tax
profits by 72 per cent last year with the help of acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits for 1992 rose from Pounds 5.51m to Pounds 9.45m. Earnings
per share, affected by last year's Pounds 23.9m rights issue, rose less
sharply to 42.8p (36.5p).
The emphasis of the business has moved since it was formed through the
merger in 1991 of Central &amp; Sheerwood, a Robert Maxwell company, and
interests controlled by Mr Geoffrey Robinson.
Through acquisitions and organic growth, dependence on the automotive
components sector has been reduced so that the main contribution to
operating profits now comes from control and manufacturing technology.
Turnover of Pounds 106.9m (Pounds 68m) produced a gain in operating profits
to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 5.38m).
Acquisitions accounted for Pounds 23m of turnover and Pounds 3m of operating
profits.
The profit growth, on top of a rise in net margins from 8.1 per cent to 8.8
per cent, partly reflected the rationalisation of acquisitions.
A final dividend of 9.75p raises the total to 16p (13p).

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ocean disposes of non-UK bulk liquid
storage operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCEAN GROUP, the freight, environmental and marine services conglomerate,
has sold the non-UK activities, or some 80 per cent, of its bulk liquid
storage company for Pounds 55m including debt.
Panocean Storage &amp; Transport, the sold business, has operations in the
Netherlands, Belgium and the US.
In 1992 it made operating profits of about Pounds 5m (Pounds 5.7m) and
pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.1m.
Shares in Ocean rose 10p to 296p yesterday.
The buyer is Royal Pakhoed, one of the biggest storage groups in Rotterdam,
the world's largest port.
The consideration is expected to be about Pounds 41m and Pakhoed is also
assuming some Pounds 14m of debt.
At December 31 the businesses had a net asset value of about Pounds 51m.
Mr Nicholas Barber, Ocean's chief executive, said that the sale would reduce
his company's gearing by 20 points to about 17 per cent and would result in
a book loss of about Pounds 16m.
He said that in profit terms Panocean 'had kept its nose clean', but that
there had been a low cash return on the assets.
'We took a hard-nosed view of a business not able to deliver the results we
required,' he added.
Ocean has retained Panocean's UK business, which has operations on
Merseyside and Humberside and, at December 31, a net asset value of about
Pounds 7m.
Pakhoed said the acquisition would boost its total worldwide storage
capacity by about 20 per cent and would give it a foothold in a new
business, the storage of edible oils and fats.
Besides chemicals and mineral oils, Pakhoed is already active in the
storage, transport and distribution of fruit and forest products.
Pakhoed said it expected the Panocean operations to make more than 1992's
Pounds 3.1m when under its control, partly because of lower interest and
overhead costs.
Mr Barber said he expected the recommended final dividend for 1992 to be
maintained at 9.62p to hold the total at 14.33p.

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Glynwed's Pounds 33m fails to impress City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLYNWED International, the diversified Midlands engineering group, yesterday
reported a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 33.1m for 1992.
However, the figure was widely expected in the City and it failed to impress
the stock market.
The shares, which last week climbed 26p to 291p, were firm immediately after
the announcement but a reaction followed and, in moderate trading, they fell
7p on the day to close at 282p. That valued the group at Pounds 580m.
For the second year running Glynwed failed to cover its maintained dividend.
Mr Gareth Davies, chairman, who promised that 'our fortunes are on the
turn', made no apology: 'We did not feel it right to cut when profits are
rising,' he said.
Earnings per share were 10.95p (8.43p) and a final dividend of 7.5p makes an
unchanged total of 11.65p for the fourth year running.
A fall in turnover to Pounds 906.4m (Pounds 949.9m) largely reflected lower
than average metal prices. However, there was a 10 per cent rise in
operating profits to Pounds 44.8m while a cut in interest charges to Pounds
11.7m (Pounds 15.4m) gave an added boost at the pre-tax level.
Glynwed's fortunes are now showing the same pattern of recovery that they
did after the 1980s recession.
The nadir of its fortunes in the current recession was in 1991. But trading
conditions remained difficult and Mr Davies attributed the profits recovery,
approaching the level of 1986, to reductions in operating costs and
increased competitiveness.
He warned that 'it will certainly not be before the second half of the year
that the benefit of interest rate reductions, and any other economic
stimulus, can be expected to have any worthwhile impact on our results.'
What Glynwed would like specifically is for the growing number of house
reservations to be translated into sales, an expansion of motor exports and
a rise in metal prices. 'If these come to pass we shall do well,' Mr Davies
asserted.
Last year Glynwed continued to take losses in its tubes and fittings
division, but profits increased from steels and engineering, were steady on
consumer and building products and declined in the plastics and property
divisions.
COMMENT
Glynwed is decently poised for recovery, and a rise in metal prices, which
has started to happen in some sectors, would rapidly feed through to the
bottom line. The group has been expert in the past in wringing profits from
staid businesses - indeed, the return on capital employed went up to 15.5
per cent from 12.4 per cent last year. But that route to higher profits
looks played out for the immediate future, pitching Glynwed's prospects
firmly on to those of the UK economy. A modest upturn would make brokers'
estimates of pre-tax profits of Pounds 45m for 1993 look a realistic
estimate. That would translate to earnings per share of 15p, putting the
shares at yesterday's price of 282p on a prospective p/e of 18.8, high
enough if it is assumed that some part of the corporate recovery is already
built into the price.

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Rediscovering a taste for the Midlands -
Engineering companies have recently been popular stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLYNWED International, more generally accustomed to a life in the shade as
an indicator of UK industrial fortunes, a stalwart of the Midlands
engineering industry, has suddenly looked fashionable. There has been a
minor vogue on the stock market for engineering companies.
Since the beginning of the year a host of Midlands industrial groups,
especially second line stocks like Concentric, Bromsgrove Industries, Ash &amp;
Lacy and Dowding &amp; Mills, have enjoyed a revival of investor interest. That
interest caught up with Glynwed last week.
Partly this reflected the expectation of higher earnings after two hard
years of recession. The surveys have been more encouraging.
This week the Engineering Employers' Federation West Midlands reported that
for the first time since last May more companies are reporting fattening
order books than those reporting a downturn in demand. Capacity utilisation
has increased modestly.
The recovery in Glynwed's annual profits is symptomatic of a more general
phenomenon in the Midlands - the great push for productivity growth during
the last two years.
Mr Gareth Davies, the Glynwed chairman, attributed the 30 per cent rise in
earnings to 'the measures taken to reduce operating costs and adapt
operations to lower levels of demand in order to improve competitiveness and
manage cash'.
The effect of cost-cutting measures on GKN, the automotive components
manufacturer with plants around the Midlands, will be seen today. And next
week IMI, the diversified engineering group and another of the large
Midlands companies, will announce its figures.
The recession pushed managements into finding ways to obtain fatter profits
from a more slender base.
In many cases, they have accepted slow market conditions as the norm and
have preferred to treat any enlargement of demand, any chance to raise
prices, as a bonus to be exploited rather than a natural change in the
commercial order of things.
Recent prices in steel billets, for example, have quickly given a new
element of profitability to some of Glynwed's steel processing. As steel
manufacturers seek to make higher prices stick, the prices of Glynwed steel
products are ratcheted upwards.
In the earlier part of the recession, solace could be sought in the markets
of continental Europe, especially for the motor component manufacturers.
Now that is disappearing, the investment fashion has swayed. Europe is out.
The UK and the US are in.
Transfer Technology is another Midlands group, the shares of which have been
favoured and which also announced figures yesterday. Part of its sharp rise
in profits came from the exposure to the US for a third of its sales of
precision components and manufacturing systems.
Glynwed captures the movement as well.
Albert E Sharp, the Birmingham-based broker, suggested: 'With the majority
of sales still made in the UK, Glynwed will clearly be a significant
beneficiary of any improvement in the domestic economy.
'The relatively small proportion of continental European earnings, which
over the last two years have been the group's main weakness, is now likely
to be one of its key attractions in the eyes of investors.'
This is not the case with either GKN or IMI, the shares of which have not
moved up with the same enthusiasm as the engineering second liners. They
both have extensive exposure to the German market, and it remains to be seen
whether their US interests will be sufficiently strong to offset any
downturn in their European markets.
After the 1980s recession there was a general move among Midlands
engineering groups to expand exports and to cut their vulnerability to the
cycles of the UK economy.
Glynwed went down this route but not with the same enthusiasm as GKN and
IMI. It was then deemed a weakness. Now it is seen as a strength.
Another factor has been the room for catching up by the engineers and the
metal processors on the stock market. Last year engineering stocks were
sluggish, declining relative to the FT-A All-Share Index.
This had the effect, this year, as interest rates settled at abnormally low
levels, of making the yield on companies like Glynwed look increasingly
attractive. Investors responded enabling the engineering sector to
out-perform the index.

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Low &amp; Bonar cashcall to fund Pounds 34m buy
from Kellogg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOW &amp; BONAR, the packaging and plastics company, yesterday launched a Pounds
50m rights issue to fund the acquisition of a folding carton manufacturer
and to reduce debt.
The group announced that it had agreed to purchase Manchester-based Cereal
Packaging from Kellogg, Europe's leading cereal manufacturer, for Pounds
33.5m cash.
Mr Jim Leng, chief executive, said the deal would create Britain's third
largest folding carton company.
Traders welcomed the cash call and acquisition and marked the shares up 9p
to 344p, in contrast to the declining market.
Mr Leng said Low &amp; Bonar expected to benefit from significantly enhanced
purchasing power following the acquisition. The group also planned to expand
Cereal Packaging's capacity - which to date had been aimed solely at
servicing Kellogg's needs. The business would compliment Low's existing
Bonar Cooke Carton operation, he said, and give access to the rapidly
growing European cereals market.
As part of the deal, Kellogg has agreed to a five-year purchasing contract
with specified prices. Based on the prices and volumes of this contract
agreement, Cereal Packaging would have made profits of roughly Pounds 4.5m
last year. Assets are expected to be valued at about Pounds 8m, following
evaluation of stocks.
The deal will be funded through a 1-for-4 rights issue of 19.5m shares at
265p. This will raise Pounds 50.2m, of which Pounds 16.7m will be used to
reduce debt.
Low &amp; Bonar, which announced a sharp decline in annual pre-tax profits from
Pounds 21.6m to Pounds 8.1m last month, has net debt of Pounds 36.5m. After
the issue, gearing will fall from 30 per cent to 15 per cent.
Mr Leng said the debt reduction would allow Low to act on other acquisition
opportunities. The company, which has reorganised its troubled US
operations, aimed to expand in Europe.
The group hoped to make an announcement within the next two months.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Number-crunchers hope to beat index with 'quant' leap: Norma
Cohen looks at changes in working methods as technology develops towards
active stock selection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH fund managers have long prided themselves on their ability to sniff
out an undervalued stock and add it to their portfolio at a cheap price.
But the poor performance returns of too many of these classic 'active' fund
managers have soured clients who, increasingly, are showing an interest in
alternative approaches to stock selection.
In this spirit, a statistics-driven system of stock selection, pioneered
largely in the US, is gaining currency in the UK and international markets.
'Active quantitative' stock selection is basically a marriage of the
analysis by traditional fund managers and the use of computers which is the
basis of quantitive technique.
Known in the US as 'black box' technique because of its reliance on
computers, UK firms have begun to offer it to pension fund clients. In
passive quantitative stock selection, the fund manager simply builds a
portfolio to mimic a specific stock index, making no judgments on relative
merits of stocks. 'Active quant' is a more systematic approach to active
portfolio management.
'We try to replicate with a computer what a traditional fund manager would
do by hand,' says Mr Kevin Rowe, partner at Buchanan Partners, an active
quant boutique which specialises in the use of equity derivatives. 'The
difference is risk control.'
The idea that risk can be reduced by selecting stocks after analysing vast
amounts of information about their characteristics is gaining currency in
Britain.
Among the leading providers of active quant fund management are Hill Samuel
Asset Management, State Street, County NatWest Investment Management,
Kleinwort Benson and several boutiques, particularly Pareto Partners,
PanAgora Asset Management and Barr-Rosenberg. The growth of active quant in
the UK has also been aided by the arrival of several firms whose sole
function is to provide databases to analysts. Among them are
California-based Barra Company and a new UK firm, Quantech.
'I think that 10 years from now we will find that traditional active
management has declined significantly and a much more computer-oriented
approach will take its place,' says Mr Roger Irwin, senior partner at
actuarial consultants R Watson and Co. 'The top-quality active quant
products will overtake the top-quality traditional products.'
Not all consultants are as enthusiastic. Mr Robert Baker, partner at Mercer
Fraser, notes that some traditional active managers score consistently above
average returns using none of the data-based analysis favoured by the active
quants. Also, there is a basic scepticism towards a technique that seems to
guarantee above-average returns.
But those who sell the technique insist its popularity is growing. Mr Alan
Greenhorn, formerly director of quantitative fund management at Hill Samuel
where he pioneered the firm's product, says that slowly, the technique is
gaining credibility in Britain. Hill Samuel manages about Pounds 450m for 11
pension fund clients, as well as managing the core of Cambridge's Emmanuel
College trust fund.
Mr Greenhorn and his team recently moved to State Street, a division of the
US firm which specialises in both passive and active quantitative fund
management techniques in the American markets. 'A few years ago, if you held
a conference on active quant, maybe three people would have shown up,' he
says. 'Now you would get dozens.'
What makes active quant different, he adds, is that vast quantities of data
can be studied to help form a clearer picture of a stock's value. 'We have
spent three years building up a database of UK stocks showing each stock's
exposure to different sectors.'
The data showed that many stocks are misrepresented by conventional
classification systems. For instance, although P&amp;O, the shipping company, is
generally classified as a transport stock, Hill Samuel's analysis showed
that only 35 per cent of its revenues come from transport.
In looking for risk, Hill Samuel examines such factors as the concentration
of earnings from different sectors by a company, overseas earnings and
cashflow as well as macro-economic factors such as interest and
exchange-rate risk and short-term price volatility.
Because large quantities of data about each company - and about the market
in which it operates - must be analysed in depth, computers are needed. The
aim is to isolate those characteristics most likely to occur in
underperforming stocks. What they are and how to spot them is a subject of
some debate.
Mr Alan Brown, chief investment officer at PanAgora Fund Managers, says that
his stock selection process has isolated roughly a dozen factors which are
likely to affect share values, such as price-to-book ratios and dividend
yield.
Because the technique is aimed as much at reducing risk as it is at
optimising returns, it is not likely to outperform an index by more than one
to two percentage points, he says. But in an industry where outperforming an
index consistently by even a fraction of 1 per cent is considered
outstanding, the attractions of active quant are clear.
Mr Rick Lecaille, assistant director at County NatWest Investment
Management, which is also offering an active quant product, says: 'The data
quality has improved dramatically over the past three years, and so has the
technology.'
Our view, is that we take the same approach as traditional active stock
managers. We strip out the key features they use in stock analysis and build
those into a computer model. I predict that in a few years, all the
traditional managers will be using some form of active quant technique.'

FT  10 MAR 93 / Saatchi writes off Pounds 600m of goodwill: Group shows
underlying profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAATCHI AND SAATCHI, the world's second largest international advertising
group, yesterday wrote off Pounds 600m of goodwill associated with US
acquisitions made when the group was expanding in the 1980s.
However, excluding the write-offs, the underlying position of the group for
1992 showed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 18.9m, against 1991's losses of
Pounds 47.2m. The figures were compiled under FRS 3, the new accounting
standard.
Group revenues grew by 1 per cent last year to Pounds 748m. Trading profits
were up 67 per cent at Pounds 34.2m, with operating margins up from 2.8 per
cent to 4.6 per cent. Mr Charles Scott, who takes over as chief executive
from Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus in April, said he expected operating margins to
be 6 per cent this year.
Mr Scott said 14 companies within the group incurred losses in 1992, in
Japan, Sweden, China and the UK, but their combined losses had been reduced
from Pounds 14m to Pounds 7m. Losses of Pounds 13.4m on disposals were
reported.
Net debt at the year-end was Pounds 194m, up from Pounds 181m. Losses per
share were 387.2p, against a restated 58.6p. Excluding the write-offs and
losses on disposals, earnings per share were 0.2p (against losses of 15.4p
for 1991). No dividend will be paid.
The write-offs - which do not affect the group's cash position -
particularly relate to the Ted Bates agency, bought for Pounds 450m in 1986.
Mr Scott said that Pounds 238m of goodwill remained on the books associated
with the 1980s acquisitions.
Mr Scott said the group had reduced the number of staff on annual salaries
of Pounds 150,000 and above from 300 to 250.
Mr Scott denied that British Airways - one of the group's most important
global accounts - was considering swapping agencies. Some big US clients had
chosen to spend relatively more of their marketing budgets on sales
promotions than brand advertising.
Analysts are forecasting 1993 pre-tax profits of about Pounds 24m.

FT  10 MAR 93 / BBA rises 53% to Pounds 47.4m pre-tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBA, the motor components group, reaped the full benefit of cost-saving
measures with a 53 per cent increase in pre-tax earnings last year, adjusted
to the new FRS 3 accounting convention.
The motors performance offset a large downturn in BBA's US-oriented aviation
parts and services operations, and virtual standstill in its industrial
division, covering industrial textiles to heavy electricals. Mr John White,
chief executive, insisted that BBA was well able to cope with an 'ominous'
downturn in the German motor industry.
BBA's group pre-tax profit of Pounds 47.4m in the year to December 31, up
from Pounds 30.9m, was earned after exceptional items and on turnover of
Pounds 1.32bn, up from 1991's Pounds 1.25bn. Profit before tax and
exceptionals was 23 per cent higher, at Pounds 60.3m (Pounds 49m). The final
dividend was held at 5.25p to make an unchanged total of 7.5p. BBA's shares
closed at 171p, up 5p.
The motor components division saw profits leap from Pounds 19.8m to Pounds
31.9m, in spite of turnover up only slightly to Pounds 621.1m from Pounds
595.7m. Mr White said the improvement reflected technical process
improvements and other cost-cutting started in 1991, particularly in
Germany.
After a record year for its German motor activities, BBA expects a 15 per
cent decline in the German original equipment market. It expects this to be
offset by business gained on several new cars, including Ford's Mondeo and
Opel's Corsa. Half BBA's motor components turnover is in the aftermarket,
for which no decline is expected.
Profits in the industrial division were virtually unchanged at Pounds 35m
(Pounds 34.9m) on sales of Pounds 486m (Pounds 458.6m). The higher aviation
turnover, up from Pounds 197.8m to Pounds 215.5m, partly reflects the merger
of BBA's Flight Services Operations with Butler Aviation International.
Sector profit slumped to Pounds 10.7m from Pounds 14.1m, as BBA steered
clear of business with carriers with potential credit worthiness problems.
With 35 per cent of total sales derived from North American operations, BBA
says it is well placed to benefit from what it sees as a strong US recovery
now under way.
However, Mr White warned of 'harsh' European economic conditions this year.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Hillsdown takes Pounds 92m shake-up provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLSDOWN Holdings yesterday announced a Pounds 92.3m extraordinary
provision within its 1992 results to cover a wide-ranging reorganisation of
the food group. Group pre-tax profits fell 17.5 per cent to Pounds 154.1m.
However, Hillsdown said that in spite of the 'disappointing' results, it was
maintaining the dividend at 8.8p for the year.
The shares were unchanged at 163p, having doubled since the group's interim
results and sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism last
September.
Investors have been encouraged by the management's new attitude to selling
or closing less profitable parts of the group. Around 30 companies, with a
turnover representing about 10 per cent of the group total, are being sold
or closed. Hillsdown also announced a shake-up of its management structure.
Sir John Nott, who takes over as chairman at next month's annual meeting,
said yesterday that Hillsdown was not looking at any acquisitions. This is
seen as a marked change from the group's one-time policy of rapid expansion
through takeovers.
Hillsdown said it was closing its property trading business with immediate
effect, and had decided to accelerate the reduction in its red meat
activities where there was 'chronic overcapacity', according to Mr David
Newton, chief executive. He said Hillsdown had decided on 'an even more
significant reduction in our exposure to the sector' than had been indicated
earlier.
In the 1992 figures there was a transfer from reserves of Pounds 59.9m,
compared with a retained profit of Pounds 5.9m. Hillsdown also wrote Pounds
103m of goodwill off reserves. The combined effect of the deficit on the
profit and loss account and the goodwill write-off was to cut reserves from
Pounds 738.9m to Pounds 562.5m. If Hillsdown had applied new accounting
standards, taking the provision above the line, the pre-tax profit would
have been Pounds 94.5m, down from Pounds 149.6m.
As well as the red meat and the property trading activities, the provision
covers rationalisation of the poultry division, and other activities such as
a Spanish meat business, a German canning operation, a North American fish
business, and 'a raft of tidying up items' said Mr Simon Moffat, finance
director.

<TEXT>
THE GERMAN chemicals industry is expected shortly to announce further
cost-cutting measures after BASF and Hoechst yesterday announced sharp falls
in 1992 profits and dividends.
BASF, the weakest of the big three, cut its dividend by DM2 to DM10 compared
with the DM3 or DM4 reduction widely expected.
The news gave all chemicals stocks and the DAX index of 30 leading shares an
immediate boost. The index closed up more than 18 points at a new high for
the year of 1,713.13. BASF stocks, which gained DM9 as soon as the news was
released ended even higher at DM240.10, up DM11.6.
A DM3 cut to DM9 in the Hoechst payout and a 17 per cent drop in earnings
were revealed after the markets closed.
According to yesterday's figures, pre-tax profits at BASF slumped 41 per
cent to DM1.24bn (Pounds 520m) on sales down 4.5 per cent at DM44.5bn.
Earnings at Hoechst were 17.7 per cent lower at DM2.1bn, while sales fell
2.8 per cent to DM45.9bn.
In spite of the early market reactions, analysts noted that both groups had
reduced their dividends by less than expected after profits fell by around
20 per cent in 1991. At the time this was interpreted as a sign that worse
was yet to come.
Early estimates of the outlook for the current year and details of further
rationalisation plans will be given at the groups' annual press conferences
next week.
Dividend and earnings details at Bayer, the last of the big three, will be
published after its supervisory board meets tomorrow.
Average prices for chemicals fell almost 2 per cent last year and stood 8.5
per cent below those of 1985, according to the chemicals industry
association. Prices for organic chemicals and plastics slumped almost 8 per
cent.
Confidence in the pharmaceuticals business, which usually avoids the worst
effects of cyclical downturns, has slumped lately because of the
introduction of price cuts, controls and prescription limits imposed from
Bonn.
According to early figures, drugs sales have fallen by between 30 and 40 per
cent in the first two months of this year.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Yeltsin's rivals set to derail reforms, warns top minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN opposition forces are poised to derail economic reform and seriously
undermine President Boris Yeltsin's ability to govern, a senior Russian
minister warned yesterday.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister for foreign economic
affairs, said the future of the reforms hung on decisions to be taken today
or tomorrow by an extraordinary session of the Russian Congress of Peoples
Deputies.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Shokhin said he expected
deputies to vote on a motion to change the constitution which would put the
power of choosing the government in the hands of the parliament - a move
which would see a new government chosen in the next few weeks or months.
'They (the Congress) now have the best chance of changing the government
that they have ever had,' he said, adding that anti-presidential forces had
grown stronger at every Congress.
Mr Shokhin's warning came as diplomats in Bonn revealed that Mr Helmut Kohl,
the German chancellor, had written to fellow western leaders urging their
support for Mr Yeltsin in his constitutional struggle.
In particular, Mr Kohl has passed on a query from Mr Yeltsin, asking for
confirmation of western political support if he is forced to introduce
emergency measures.
Yesterday Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, dismissed Mr
Yeltsin's most recent proposals on constitutional reform.
The draft law proposed by Mr Yeltsin if parliament did not agree to his
preferred option of a referendum was 'not serious' and should not be
considered, Mr Khasbulatov said.
But Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, deputy prime minister, warned that if Mr Yeltsin
was denied a referendum or an agreement, he would run his own plebiscite.
When supported by the people, he would take 'certain action against other
branches of power'.
Mr Shokhin said that, if the Congress accepted proposals framed last week by
Mr Yeltsin, the government would tighten monetary and credit policy. If not,
'we will continue to try but it will be much more difficult'.
He said if Congress 'makes one little amendment it will have power over the
cabinet. This means that we would have a new government which would put
forward a soft economic policy'.
The government was prepared to compromise again with parliament - 'including
considering personnel changes in the cabinet' - but it could not move beyond
a fundamental commitment to bring down inflation and the budget deficit, and
retain good relations with the west.
The indications yesterday were that Mr Yeltsin would not win acceptance of
these proposals, already turned down by the smaller Supreme Soviet - nor
that Congress would approve the four questions he wants on the ballot paper
in the referendum he wishes to hold on April 11.
The questions are an attempt to achieve:
agreement to Russia becoming a presidential republic
a two-tiered parliament to replace the current Congress and Supreme Soviet
the convening of a constitutional assembly to draw up a new constitution
private ownership of land.
The Supreme Soviet agreed to pass the four questions to today's meeting of
Congress for a final decision. Mr Nikolai Ryabov, the deputy speaker of the
parliament, said that two of the questions might be accepted, but two - on
the presidential republic and the constituent assembly - were impermissible.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Brussels aims to cut phone bills with wider competition
proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FAR-REACHING plan to open all domestic and international telephone calls
in the European Community to competition is being considered by the European
Commission.
The plan would aim to cut the cost of calls and improve the efficiency of
Community telecommunications operators.
Brussels originally favoured opening the market for only cross-border calls
within the EC. But senior Commission officials now believe the next wave of
EC telecoms legislation should go further.
They are urging the EC to set itself a more ambitious and controversial
target of full liberalisation of 'voice telephony'. This could include all
domestic and cross-border calls within the EC, and calls to countries
outside the Community. Person-to-person calls represent between 80 and 90
per cent of the EC market.
Nearly six months of consultations are said to have demonstrated that most
operators, and almost all consumers favour far-reaching liberalisation and
harmonisation proposals, partly for practical reasons.
Officials will not reveal their ideal timetable for liberalisation, but hope
to achieve open competition within 10 years. Poorer EC member states, such
as Portugal, Greece, Spain and Ireland, could be given longer to modernise
their telephone networks.
Commission consultations will end with two meetings between the Commission,
operators and regulators at the end of this month. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC
telecoms commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, responsible for competition,
should decide whether to press for full liberalisation soon after.
Mr Bangemann's spokesman said yesterday the commissioner did not yet have a
view on the matter.
Officials hope to receive political support for their plan at the scheduled
meeting of EC telecoms ministers on May 10. The first phase of draft
legislation would follow before the end of this year.
The main battles are likely to be over the timing of a phased legislation.
Member states will also have to work out how to safeguard public monopolies'
commitment to provide an equal service to all consumers.
British Telecom, the UK's largest privatised operator, wants the Commission
to use special legislative powers to break open the market immediately.
Deutsche Telekom, the state-owned German group, favours introducing
competition on all long-distance calls, domestic and international, but says
a formal decision should not be taken until the end of 1998, by which time
it would have completed a DM60bn (Pounds 25.4bn) programme of infrastructure
investment in eastern Germany.
The Commission has already pushed through directives increasing competition
in specialised data and information services, which account for about 10 per
cent of the EC market. But hardliners within the Commission have always
criticised the inflated cost of international and intra-EC calls, which they
say hampers the competitiveness of EC companies.
If the Commission decides to push for open competition, it will be evidence
that the EC's executive has begun to recover its dented self-confidence.
Last summer, the Commission twice delayed approval of a document on the
liberalisation options to avoid annoying France before the referendum on the
Maastricht treaty.
The first phase of a new approach would be to ensure that existing
directives have been enforced. The second stage would build on existing
legislation allowing 'closed user groups' to lease lines from telecoms
companies - for example, for communication between company offices.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Errors led to shortfall of Pounds 35m in business rates fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of the Environment may have lost more than Pounds 35m in the
first year of collecting business rates because of errors in figures
supplied by local authorities.
The losses arose because the department accepted as reliable local authority
figures that had been qualified by their auditors.
A report published today by the National Audit Office, the government
expenditure watchdog, says the department was slow to realise the
significance of the auditors' qualifications.
Over a third of the returns sent in by local authorities had been qualified
by their auditors. The main reason was weaknesses in councils' computer
systems which made it hard to check that the correct amount of business
rates had been collected.
The returns are used to redist-ribute income from uniform bus-iness rates
between local authorities according to a nationally determined formula.
Councils that collect more than they are entitled to must pay money into a
pool; those that collect less receive a net payment.
After the end of the year, the environment department makes a final
adjustment for each council based on its audited return. Once the final
adjustment has been made, the department cannot reopen the case, even if
mistakes later emerge.
At the end of 1990-91, the first year of the system, 123 out of 366 returns
had been qualified by their auditors. The first 36 qualified returns,
covering Pounds 962m, were settled by the department without questioning the
significance of the qualifications.
Steps were taken with the remaining 87 qualified returns to resolve problems
arising from auditors' concerns. However, the audit office says there may
still have been losses where local authority computer systems provided
inadequate evidence to check the accuracy of payments.
The exact shortfall is difficult to quantify, according to the audit office.
However, it estimates that the environment department failed to collect up
to Pounds 22.5m, and wrongly paid out up to Pounds 13.2m. Some of this
shortfall may be recouped in later years, according to the audit office. The
report says that steps have been taken to improve the accuracy and
auditability of the returns for future years.
As a result of the shortfall, Sir John Bourn, head of the NAO, has qualified
his audit opinion on the environment department's 1991-92 account for
non-domestic rates.

<TEXT>
Yesterday's producer price figures make it difficult to avoid the conclusion
that inflation looks set to remain low despite the devaluation. Thanks
partly to productivity gains, the underlying rate of output price growth was
only 2.7 per cent in the year to February. Retail price inflation may thus
stay within the government's target range, reducing upward pressure on
interest rates as recovery takes hold.
That augurs well for growth which should, in turn, boost government
revenues, easing its PSBR problem. But lower than expected inflation has
drawbacks in this respect too. Tax revenues are affected quickly; many
spending benefits only accrue later. Nor is there much scope for pushing
public sector pay increases below the government's existing 1.5 per cent
target. Success on the inflation front will force the government to work
extra hard to contain its deficit. But it does, at least, provide cover for
measures such as the non-indexation of tax allowances, clawback of spending
increases and extending the reach of VAT.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BBA's decision to switch half of its dollar borrowings back into sterling
looks like a perverse consequence of accounting conventions. Like others,
the company had previously matched its foreign assets against borrowings on
the argument that this protected it from exchange rate movements - any fall
in sterling would increase the value of foreign assets and debts equally.
Low dollar interest rates also kept down borrowing costs, and the practice
conveniently transfers profits back to the UK to reduce advance corporation
tax problems.
However, sterling's fall produces strange effects in such groups'
consolidated balance sheets. Because their capital is in sterling and much
of the debt is in overseas subsidiaries, any fall in the pound raises the
level of balance sheet gearing. Yet provided the debt is properly matched
against real business interests, and interest cover in local currencies is
adequate, the gearing rise is a purely accounting phenomenon. BBA's
management, however, does not want to see gearing rise any more as a result
of any further fall in sterling. Hence the transfer of debt.
Its concern is understandable given the excessive importance attached to
gearing. Yet crystallising a foreign exchange loss because conventions
struggle to cope with the real world is the accounting tail wagging the
operational dog. The Accounting Standards Board might care to look at what
is clearly an inadequate method for translating foreign subsidiaries into
consolidated sterling accounts.

FT  10 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Hillsdown Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hillsdown's annual results might have dissolved the market's worst fears but
they also highlight fresh anxieties. The held dividend and the new
management's resolve to squeeze higher profits from its Pounds 4.4bn of
sales will certainly have underpinned the strong recovery in Hillsdown's
shares since September. But the yield story is rapidly exhausting itself.
Further gains will depend on strong earnings. These, though, are likely to
prove highly elusive. Under the new FRS 3 UK accounting standard, Hillsdown
recorded losses per share of 0.3p last year.
Hillsdown is wielding the butcher's knife in its attempt to improve
efficiencies. The Pounds 92.3m extraordinary reorganisation charge reflects
its serious intent to sort out 30 underperforming businesses. The
rationalisation of its poultry division shows what can be achieved.
Sterling's devaluation will also help by bolstering overseas earnings and
restoring Hillsdown's competitiveness against marauding French chickens. But
the diversity of Hillsdown's portfolio suggests surgery will be a drawn-out
process. An increasing tax charge will further hinder earnings progress this
year.
The market may also question the long term future of a low margin producer
of commodity foods. As yet, the management has scarcely addressed the
strategic issue. They are surely right to conclude that without greater
predictability of cash flow little else can follow.

European chemicals companies are clearly reluctant to follow ICI's example
by maintaining dividends through the downturn. With the exception of Akzo,
all are some way behind in the process of rationalisation. Without a rights
issue to support, the likes of BASF and Hoechst have little incentive to pay
out more than they can afford at this uncertain stage in the chemicals
cycle. That makes it difficult to interpret BASF's decision to shave only
DM2 from last year's DM12 dividend.
Judging by the 5 per cent rise in the shares, the market was braced for
something worse. The sketchy full-year figures released yesterday suggest a
better fourth quarter than expected. But it is too early to call the turn.
In August, BASF was not anticipating a sustained recovery in petrochemicals
until the second half of the decade. DSM, which is equally exposed to bulk
chemicals and the sliding German economy, has halved its dividend in view of
the bleak outlook.
If BASF has tax or other short-term reasons for maintaining a relatively
high payout this time, another cut can not be ruled out. The 6.5 per cent
gross yield - a match for the return on German government bonds - would then
be an unreliable support. If the company is trying to please investors by
smoothing the dividend, though, the shares may have further to rise. BASF
has a balance sheet strong enough to stand the strain of such a policy
without a rights issue.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Fiscal fever infects congressmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress's Democratic majority is set to agree on even deeper cuts in
spending than those proposed by President Bill Clinton.
The House of Representatives Budget Committee is expected to vote today on a
budget resolution that will make extra spending cuts totalling Dollars 63bn
(Pounds 44bn) over five years on top of Mr Clinton's own plan, which had
aimed to trim government spending over the period by a net Dollars 222bn.
Agreement on the budget resolution is the latest stage in a fever of fiscal
responsibility that has infected liberal spenders, conservative farm
subsidisers and fervent opponents of tax increases alike.
President Clinton first agreed on an additional Dollars 55bn of spending
cuts with Democratic party leaders in the House of Representatives on Monday
night, but further meetings on Capitol Hill prompted Democrats on the House
Budget Committee to expand those cuts to Dollars 63bn, and Democrats in the
Senate are working on an even larger batch of cuts.
When Mr Clinton announced his budget plan last month, it was widely assumed
that he would have trouble keeping its spending cuts intact. Instead,
Congressional Democrats have outdone him.
'When the whole process started, the issue was, would the Congress go as far
as the president recommended,' said Congressman Martin Sabo, chairman of the
House Budget Committee. 'I'm just indicating we'll go further.'
The White House is now worried if it will be able to preserve the increased
spending on infrastructure, technology, the environment and education that
also forms part of the Clinton economic plan. Some conservative Democrats
are seeking, in particular, to trim the Dollars 16.3bn package to provide a
short-term stimulus to the economy.
Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said yesterday that Congress was
'moving in the right direction' but warned that deeper cuts might be
counter-productive.
The debate is concentrated on the budget resolution, which provides general
outlines for spending and revenues. When detailed cuts are taken
line-by-line in later appropriations bills, following presentation of the
complete Clinton budget on April 5, members of Congress are expected to lose
much of their new-found enthusiasm for fiscal discipline as they fight to
preserve the programmes that benefit their own districts.
However, Democratic leaders have had to work towards a consensus on the
budget resolution knowing they can count only on their own party, since the
Republicans have made it clear they will not vote for the Clinton budget.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Barely afloat on a cruel sea: John Lloyd says that President
Yeltsin has few options left as the power struggle in Moscow intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A special Congress of People's Deputies will convene today in Moscow, the
latest in a series which has loomed over Russian political life over the
past year. Like vast clouds, they roll in from the horizon, preceded by
prophecies that this time the deluge they carry will swamp President Boris
Yeltsin and his government.
As Timothy Colton, head of Harvard's Research Centre, says in a recent
book*, prediction 'is about as easy as judging a symphony by its opening
bars: the ear picks out isolated chords and notes, melody and rhythm elude
it'. Using this metaphor, we can say that the Russian symphony becomes more
and more discordant, and no one is playing together.
Mr Yeltsin and his government have few options left except to tough it out.
Their mood is hard, though whether that hardness has depth, or is simply
brittle, will be tested at today's Congress. Mr Yeltsin has threatened
unspecific action of an authoritarian kind in order to inspire fear. If
Congress calls his bluff, he either has to act decisively - or make yet
another messy compromise, which will deepen and prolong the crisis.
The parliament, both Congress and the Supreme Soviet, are increasingly
opposed to the president and government. As Galina Starovoitova, the former
presidential adviser, said recently: 'We are in the anomalous position of
having the parliamentary majority in the opposition.' The centrists no
longer think Mr Yeltsin recognises their concerns and can answer them. Mr
Alexander Vladislavlev, deputy head of the Union of Industrialists and
leader of the Renewal party, said yesterday: 'Yeltsin is not really
interested in consensus and compromise. And if he does the kind of thing he
seems to be threatening, then we are back to the Politburo and the Bolshevik
era.'
Among the harder opponents are a substantial proportion who are engaged on
quasi - or fully - treasonable activities, such as conspiring with military
officers to overthrow the state authorities. This goes on openly; communist
and nationalist deputies demonstrate together for the resignation of the
president to whom the latter have taken an oath of loyalty. They stand on
platforms and threaten extra-parliamentary action to achieve this end. No
move is made against them.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker who remains in
parliamentary terms a moderate, has little room left in which to make yet
another of his famous last-ditch compromises. Mr Valery Zorkin, the chairman
of the Constitutional Court who devised the last deal between parliament and
the president, has since compromised his position by siding with Mr
Khasbulatov in rejecting a referendum.
Those loyal to Mr Yeltsin, such as Mr Boris Nemtsov, the governor of Nizhny
Novgorod, famous for his support of pro-market change in his region, say
that the anti-presidential forces simply do not have the strength to stop
the tide of change. 'In so far as they want to centralise power back in
Moscow, they cannot do so except with guns. And I don't think they have
enough. It has gone too far.'
Still, in his celebration of the freedom given to (or taken by) him and
other regional bosses, Mr Nemtsov implicitly admits the perceived weakness
of the present administration: its inability to stop Russia falling apart. A
chorus of domestic and foreign observers now likens Mr Yeltsin to Mr Mikhail
Gorbachev in mid-1991, floundering helplessly before a disintegrating state.
And the people? The clamour that 'things were better before' grows ever
louder. En route back from Nizhny, three separate strangers took time and
trouble to stress how much they hated what was happening in their country.
One, an Aeroflot flight attendant, said she knew that the lemonade she was
serving was terrible - 'but it was better before. And now so expensive] If
the quality was better it wouldn't be so bad'.
Even in the privatised shops in Nizhny, the pride of Russia's reformers,
there was grumbling about the political instability in the town which made
the proprietors unsure that they would be allowed to transform themselves
from payers of rent to real owners.
A Moscow paper at the end of last week asked the citizens of Verdlovsk (now
Ekaterinburg) - Mr Yeltsin's old home town and his former base as first
secretary - how they felt about their favourite son. Sour, said most of
them. The tenants of his old flat were just putting up a solid steel front
door for protection and the neighbour was hanging out pictures of Stalin to
commemorate the 40th anniversary of his death last Friday.
All the polls show Mr Yeltsin's popularity down, and support for some kind
of 'firm grip' ever increasing. 'I fear the Russian mass, aroused and
pitiless,' said Mr Yeltsin last December, quoting Pushkin. Everyone fears
that now, and they fear one another. The nation is teetering, its leaders
struggling over the tiller as the storm breaks. The best of them, in and out
of government, can hardly keep reform's momentum going.
Mr Yeltsin's options are stark. He either makes a compromise with the
parliament, or he decides to break with it. He has signalled a willingness
to do both, keeping them guessing, alarming them with talk of decisive
measures, soothing again with suggestions of compromises. He may not yet
know himself which road to take.
The compromise route could entail dropping the idea of a referendum and
accepting a firm date for parliamentary and presidential elections. If this
were the route taken, both constitutional and economic change would be
further stymied. Mr Yeltsin could hardly allow his government to inflict the
pain of real 'shock therapy' on a people whose vote he would soon be
canvassing; parliament, under the present constitution, can obstruct any
attempt to adopt a new constitution because it can block every legal step
towards it.
Having passed up the chance to reform a Soviet-era parliament and
constitution while he retained the momentum and popularity to do so a year
and a half ago, President Yeltsin is now enmeshed in the closed circles
which the constitution prescribes. Mr Khasbulatov, the speaker, says only a
parliamentary system can safeguard Russia's new-won freedom. Mr Yeltsin says
that only an authoritative presidency can drive through reform and, by doing
so, safeguard democracy. Behind the undoubted importance of the rival
conceptions lies a naked power struggle. Compromise is only a pause between
rounds, never an agreement in principle.
But to break out of this would be fraught with risk. General Pavel Grachev,
the defence minister, may have allowed it to be reported that the army wants
'decisive measures'. But he has been as contradictory as Mr Yeltsin, and
must fear that, if he comes out in full support of the president, he may
this time back the wrong horse. (General Grachev got his job by choosing to
back Mr Yeltsin against the coup leaders in August 1991.)
The bottom line of presidential rule, or the declaration of a state of
emergency, is an army willing to shoot its own people. An army willing to do
that must either be desperate, or believe that the power in whose name it is
doing the shooting will survive to give it political exculpation in the
longer term.
Mr Yeltsin, unfortunately, is now seen as possibly being a short-term
president - by both foreign and domestic observers. He needs to show he is
in charge, and decisively in charge, in order to dispel that view. Yet to do
so he risks everything. Today's Congress is - yet again - a critical moment
for Russia, and for the world.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Personal View: Why US locomotive should decouple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESTER C THUROW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past 20 years the distribution of earnings in the US has been
changing in a way which, until recently, has not been matched in the rest of
the industrial world. Despite the fact that the real American per capita
gross national product has been rising (up almost 30 per cent from 1973 to
1992), real earnings have been falling for much of the workforce. While
about 20 per cent of the male workforce has been on a rapidly rising up
escalator, another 20 per cent has been on a level moving sidewalk, and the
remaining 60 per cent has been on a down escalator.
Two factors lie behind these statistics. Technology seems to be demanding a
much more skilled workforce. Wages have been rising for the skilled and
falling for the unskilled. As the US is much more open to manufactured
imports from low-wage third-world countries than from Europe or Japan, what
economists know as 'factor price equalisation' (in a global economy those
with third-world skills will make third-world incomes even if they are
living in first-world countries) also seems to be pushing down wages of the
unskilled.
To some extent America's working wives have come to the rescue. By working
an increasing number of hours a year they have succeeded in holding the real
family incomes of the bottom 60 per cent of the population approximately
constant, even though male wages have been falling. The average American
family rightly sees itself working much harder yet making no economic
progress. Even more frightening, most of these families now have little
unused female work effort that they can throw into the economic fray. Wives
are already working close to full-time. Nothing but economic decline looms
ahead.
Not surprisingly, voting studies reveal that those on the up escalator voted
overwhelmingly for President George Bush while those on the down escalator
voted overwhelmingly for President Bill Clinton. To have any chance of
delivering on his promise to stop the down escalator, Clinton needs to offer
a number of things, such as greater investment in skills. And a 4 to 4.5 per
cent rate of growth is an absolute necessity if he is to create better job
opportunities and rising real wages for the 80 per cent male workforce that
did not participate in the economic gains of the 1970s and 1980s.
But suppose he were to succeed and the 4.8 per cent growth rate of the
fourth quarter of 1992 were to be sustained. Mr Clinton would immediately
have a trade problem. The US starts with a large trade deficit (rising
towards Dollars 100bn) and could expect a huge surge of imports if its
economy were to grow much faster than the economies of rest of the
industrial world.
But if this surge of imports were to occur, it would essentially drown
President Clinton's economic recovery. If one looks at the relationship
between output and employment in American manufacturing, every Dollars 45bn
in extra manufactured imports essentially costs the American economy 1m
jobs. Mr Clinton cannot afford to lose those jobs. If he does, he will not
be able to deliver on his promises to those that elected him. As a result,
the president has no choice but to take whatever actions are necessary to
ensure that the US trade deficit does not worsen. To put it bluntly,
President Clinton cannot let the American economy become a locomotive for
the rest of the world.
The rest of the world is now an economic train too large for the US
locomotive to pull alone. If the US were to try, its recovery would simply
stall. The right answer from the the perspective of the US and the world is
an aggressive co-ordinated fiscal and monetary expansion with the three big
economies (Germany, Japan and the US) acting as a joint locomotive. If such
co-ordination cannot be arranged quickly, however, Mr Clinton will have no
choice but to take direct action to stop the US trade deficit from
worsening.
The clash between the world's desire to hook on to the American locomotive
and President Clinton's need to decouple his locomotive from the rest of the
world's economic train will be most acute with respect to Japan. Japan has a
Dollars 135bn trade surplus, which is rising at the rate of Dollars 50bn a
year. Based upon history, if the US were to grow substantially faster than
Japan, Japanese exports to the US could be expected to surge.
The problem is very simple. Japan does not know how to engineer an economic
recovery without such an export surge; the US will not have a domestic
recovery if such a Japanese export surge were to occur.
The immovable object meets the irresistible force.

True, the English could not be expected to go as far as the Irish, who are
re-opening the disused public toilets near Dublin's Trinity College as an
exhibition hall for two sculpted bronze urinals - one in the shape of
Britain and the other of Ireland. But surely there's a case for granting
public access to top people's toilets tantamount to works of art in their
own right.
There are several examples in the City of London alone. Word has it that the
Bank of England harbours some sumptuous sanctums, especially for upper
rankers. Moreover, the Midland Bank chairman's chamber is decked out with
shoe-shine apparatus, three hairbrushes, comb, clothes brush, nail scissors
and nail file.
Nominations for others deserving tourist-attraction status welcomed.

Could this be a political first? A political opinion pollster who has
nothing to say.
Elaine Winter, editor of the NOP Political Social Economic Review, part of
Lord Hollick's MAI stable, has suspended publication of its bi-monthly
review. 'This is largely a result of the fact that since the general
election there has been a hiatus in the political polling that we normally
do due to lack of interest,' she says in a sad letter to subscribers.
'People were so fed up with it after the election that they are not
commissioning polls. If anyone needs voting intention data they can phone us
up and ask if we have it, but we are doing more social than political work
these days,' says Winter. She promises customers their money back and says
publication will resume as soon as 'we have enough material'. Maybe if
Maastricht's upsets continue, Winter's discontent could turn into glorious
summer earlier than she thinks.

So John Birt claims that he saved only Pounds 810 in tax by being paid his
BBC salary through a private company. The great man has clearly never heard
the story of the Victorian parlour-maid. When tackled over the arrival of an
illegitimate child, she replied: 'It's only a little one, ma'am'.
Birt, unlike the parlour maid, had the benefit of a report from accountants
Ernst &amp; Young to quantify the mischief. But despite this impressive
imprimatur, we suspect that Birt's mission to explain has been about as
successful as the early day attempt to shrink the kid.

So who's being tipped for the job of UN's chief political representative for
Bosnia once a peace agreement has been concluded? Lord David Owen, that's
who.
Though many obstacles still stand in the way of a settlement, the nitty
gritty of implementing an agreement is already being discussed in private by
members of the UN Security Council.
It is already clear that Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali will have
to appoint not just an overall commander for the greatly enlarged
international force required to operate the military provisions of the
hoped-for settlement, but a political representative to boot.
After his impressive performance as one of the two co-chairmen of the
Bosnian peace conference, Owen is virtually certain of winning the support
of the European Community and Russia for the new political appointment. The
French, in particular, have been impressed by his combative style, not least
the manner in which he has countered US criticisms of the peace plan he drew
up with Cyrus Vance. In short, the lost leader has returned to the fore.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With simultaneous puffs of white smoke from New York and London yesterday,
two of the world's best known business weeklies change editors. In the US
the parents of Barron's, one of Wall Street's more conservative
institutions, played safe. By contrast, albeit true to form, the owners of
The Economist catapulted yet another young fizzer into the editor's chair.
The contrast between the two new editors couldn't be wider. Barron's James
Meagher, now 57, is a career hack who was number two to Alan Abelson, the
revered editor for over a decade. The Economist's new chief Bill Emmott is a
good 20 years younger, and has what Americans would describe as an Ivy
league background.
He was chosen over the magazine's 46-year-old deputy editor, Nicholas
Colchester, an old FT hand and fellow Oxford man. They even went to the same
college, Magdalen.
The Economist has a tradition of picking young turks as editors. One has to
go back over 30 years, to Donald Tyerman, who took over from Geoffrey
Crowther, to find an editor who was over 40 when selected for The Economist
chair. Given that Tyerman was one of the less successful editors, The
Economist's emphasis on youth has paid off to date.
The magazine's circulation has long since surpassed Barron's and is rising.
Emmott is a popular choice among his staff. His intellect is not in doubt
and his managerial skills have been tested by a stint knocking the Economic
Intelligence Unit into shape.
That said, however, there's always a risk in leap-frogging an older
generation. Not least because there is so much farther for The Economist to
fall in its 150th year.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Major must persevere
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN WILL ratify the Maastricht treaty. If it fails to do so it will lose
its influence in Europe and probably Mr John Major's Conservative government
as well. That is why it is highly likely - nothing is certain - that the
necessary legislation will be passed during the next six months. The defeat
of the government on a minor amendment on Monday night demonstrated that the
Conservative party is divided, and that the prime minister is ruling from a
position of parliamentary weakness. But that is merely to confirm what was
already well-known. It does not mean that the bill will be thrown out.
Nor should it be. The treaty, which is not perfect, is the product of long
negotiations during which a number of important concessions were made to
British sensibilities. The debate about the degree to which the Maastricht
agreement represents a step towards a European federal state is sterile; the
fact is that British business believes it has a chance of prospering within
the wider European economy, while it would be hard-pressed to thrive if it
is obliged to compete alone in the deep blue sea. Even those who are
unwilling to concede the merits of Maastricht as a logical development of
the single market should accept that for the UK it represents the minimum
price of admission to European deliberations.
Most members of the House of Commons understand this. The three national
parties fought the election last April on manifestos that indicated support
for Britain's developing membership of the European Community. Each one has
its contingent of Europhobes, but the prevailing view among Conservative,
Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs alike is that the Maastricht treaty must be
ratified.
Mr Major should do all he can to ensure that the voice of this majority
prevails as soon as possible. The delays caused by the tactics of the bills'
various critics and opponents are getting in the way of other business. If
the process is dragged on through the summer Britain's commitment to
honouring its signature may begin to be questioned by Community partners and
potential investors.
The blame for delay should not be shouldered by the prime minister alone,
although the government's tactics have been less than brilliant. Labour and
the Liberal Democrats, both ostensibly committed to ratification, have
become shameless opportunists. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Mr Paddy
Ashdown, wants his party to be noticed; the Labour leader, Mr John Smith,
needs to maintain unity in his own ranks by being seen to attack the
government whenever possible. The votes of both these 'pro-European' parties
were cynically combined with those of the anti-European Tory rebels on
Monday.
There is not much that Mr Major can do to end the rebels' filibuster, or
even to avoid defeat on Britain's opt-out from the social chapter. He cannot
agree with Labour that Britain should opt in to the social chapter. That
would be unacceptable to a majority of Conservatives. He cannot agree to the
rebels' demand for a referendum before the treaty is ratified; that would
make a nonsense of his own previous statements, and might even fail to pass
through the House.
He could, however, promise a referendum before Britain opts in to a European
single currency, if a future government chooses to do so. That would not
prevent ratification now. It may allay the fears of at least a few
Eurosceptics. Such an offer should only be considered as a last resort.
Meanwhile Mr Major must persevere, and take his knocks as the bill is fought
according to Britain's quaint rules of parliamentary procedure.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Leading Article: UK calling US
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications' application this week for a licence to operate
an international service out of the US provides a golden opportunity to
sweep away restrictive practices which keep the cost of transatlantic calls
artificially high. The price of calls between the US and the UK - now 56p a
minute - could fall by more than half if there were a competitive market,
analysts say. Since there are about 1.5bn minutes of telephone traffic
between the two countries each year, the prize of cheaper calls is well
worth having.
To win this prize, the US and UK will need to take bold action to open up
their markets. It will not be easy, given that two years of talks aimed at
achieving precisely this have made little progress.
The snag is that, though both governments want a reciprocal opening of
markets, their phone companies have provided them with multiple excuses for
keeping their markets shut. Whenever the UK's Department of Trade and
Industry has suggested opening the UK end of the transatlantic route to more
competition, BT and other British phone companies have complained about
discrimination against them in the US. Whenever the US Federal
Communications Commission has suggested relaxing restrictions on UK
companies in the US, American Telephone and Telegraph and other US carriers
have pointed out that they are not allowed international licences in the UK.
The result has been a logjam. So successful have the established carriers
been in keeping markets closed that one wonders whether their aim has been
to gain access to each others' markets or simply to protect their home turf.
BT's licence application offers a chance to break the logjam. This will not
be achieved, however, if the authorities in both countries continue to
listen to producer lobbies instead of focusing on the wider economic
benefits of competitive markets. Politicians also need to take an active
interest, rather than leaving the matter in the hands of middle-ranking
officials. Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK's secretary of state for trade and
industry, should reopen talks as soon as a new head of the FCC is appointed.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Little succour for the stricken: Andrew Jack examines
growing pressures to reform corporate insolvency law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The threat of further job losses hanging over British workers at Leyland
Daf, the commercial vehicle maker in receivership, is a striking reminder of
the destructive process of insolvency creeping across corporate Britain.
The introduction of the 1986 Insolvency Act after nearly a decade of debate
was seen as an important support for struggling businesses. But after being
put to its first real test in the recession, that belief is now being called
into question.
Mr Chris Hughes, head of insolvency at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's largest
accounting firm, reflects this pessimism. He says that all too often the law
amounts to a prescription to 'bayonet the wounded' among companies in
financial difficulty. He calls for wholesale reform of the law.
His remarks had important symbolic value, since the 1986 Insolvency Act was
based on a report by a committee chaired by the late Sir Kenneth Cork of
Cork Gully, the insolvency firm which merged with Coopers 13 years ago. The
report called for measures to help businesses in debt survive and preserve
their employees' jobs. Its proposals proved highly controversial, and the
legislation had 1,200 amendments before it was passed.
The evidence suggests Sir Kenneth's hopes have not been realised. Figures
from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the corporate information group, show 16,600 business
failures in 1982, in the middle of the last recession. In 1992, the number
was 62,800. Failures as a proportion of all companies paying value-added tax
jumped from 1.2 per cent in 1982 to 2.8 per cent in 1991.
Several insolvency firms have started to call for modifications to the law.
Their primary concerns focus on improvements to the operation of two
procedures introduced by the 1986 act: administration orders and company
voluntary arrangements (CVAs). More radical suggestions would weaken the
power of creditors.
Administration orders offer the chance for a company to survive by keeping
it trading and protected from its creditors while it restructures. Companies
apply to the courts for such protection and, if the application is
successful, an insolvency practitioner is appointed to oversee the process.
Well-known examples include Mr Asil Nadir's group Polly Peck International,
British &amp; Commonwealth, the financial services group, and Olympia &amp; York,
the developers of Canary Wharf.
In some cases administration has proved successful. Chancery, a small
financial services company, was successfully reconstructed at the end of
1991. But most companies under administration have failed to emerge intact.
Mr Hughes argues that more companies should be encouraged to apply through
the courts for protection, by simplifying the procedures and by removing
disincentives. These include the requirement for the administrator to report
on the conduct of the company's directors. He would also like the law to
permit creditors to apply for administration orders and the courts
themselves to propose them.
Few want to see the procedure become more like the protection from creditors
offered under Chapter 11 in the US. This leaves the management in charge of
the company, generates a complicated series of creditors' committees and
results in large professional fees over years.
'Chapter 11 is frightful,' says Mr Mark Homan of Price Waterhouse, the
accountancy firm. 'The debtor is lawyered to death.'
Insolvency practitioners are equally eager for reform of company voluntary
arrangements, under which the management puts up a restructuring proposal to
creditors and continues to run the company. CVAs have to be approved by
court order but the system is far less bureaucratic than other insolvency
procedures.
However, under the current CVA system, a company has no protection from its
creditors once it has informed them of its need to renegotiate its debts -
unlike under the system of administration. Neither do CVAs offer protection
to directors against wrongful trading prosecutions if they operate insolvent
businesses. As a result, CVAs are only normally used once an administration
order is coming to its end.
'We need a stay of execution of about a month under some supervisory
authority during which directors have the chance of renegotiating their
debts,' says Mr Homan. During that period, the company would be protected
from any action by its creditors.
The problems with administration orders and CVAs are illustrated by the fact
that since the 1986 law went into effect they have been used in less than 1
per cent of all insolvency procedures (see table).
Many companies entering receivership do not end up in liquidation, but are
ultimately sold as running businesses without the loss of all their
employees. But the process is still destructive, since it may jeopardise the
survival of other small businesses or individuals who are creditors to the
company and are unlikely to be paid in full. 'One company's bad debts are
another company's failure,' says Mr Paul Shipperlee of accountants Levy Gee.
A more radical approach to cutting the number of insolvencies, advocated by
some practitioners, would be to reduce the incentive of creditors to appoint
receivers. That could be achieved by abolishing floating charges - the
system whereby banks secure their loans against all of a company's assets.
This gives the receiver the power to raise funds on behalf of the creditor
from across the business.
In most other countries, by contrast, banks can only secure loans with fixed
charges on specific named assets. Receivers, which are appointed by the
banks, are therefore more restricted in their ability to raise funds from
the business concerned.
The various calls for insolvency reform have, until recently, received
little official support. But late last year, the Department of Trade and
Industry announced a wide-ranging reform of company law. A part of this
review, according to Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, would
include an examination of CVAs. Further details are expected later this
year.
But there is still much disagreement about how extensive reform should be.
Mr Nigel Hamilton of Ernst &amp; Young and the president of the Society of
Practitioners of Insolvency, believes that the procedures of administration
and CVAs need some amendments. However, he says radical reform is not
necessary and that the existing law can be made to work.
Insolvency practitioners are also reluctant to endorse publicly reform of
floating charges, since so much of their business is awarded by banks. Banks
would resist any move to curb their power over borrowers. But the ideas are
being discussed by bodies such as the insolvency lawyers association.
Equally, Mr Nigel Hamilton argues that a 'rescue culture' cannot be achieved
by changes in the law alone. He says that the Inland Revenue and Customs &amp;
Excise - typically large creditors to companies in trouble - are often too
inflexible in negotiations which could save a business. More generally, he
says that by the time insolvency practitioners are called in, it is often
too late to achieve a rescue.
A recent survey by the society estimated that the most important reason for
company collapses was management failure. Many left it far too late to seek
professional assistance in paying their debts, leaving little alternative to
receivership.
Mr Chris Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross, the
accountancy firm, says he frequently comes across directors who have pursued
lavish lifestyles, written cheques to creditors but then stuffed them into
desk draws, and failed to send out invoices. 'We suffer from a lack of
competent management to steer companies through difficult times,' he says.
The quality of management is unlikely to improve quickly. But with reform of
insolvency procedures also expected to be a protracted process, many more
companies, their creditors and employees will face the prospect of collapse.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Letter: New growth theory as the backdrop of policy
initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R KOZUL-WRIGHT and Mr J M VAN BRABANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's heavy-handed treatment of the new growth theory
('Endogenous growth - treat with care', March 4) misses the core of the
debate. He implies that this is merely a re-run of a familiar (and
intrinsically flawed) story stressing capital investments and government
subsidies. This is incorrect.
First, his summary of new growth theory as 'throw(ing) bricks and mortar,
machinery or research laboratories at problems' as the 'key to prosperity'
misses the stress on the interdependence of technology, training, trade and
capital investment. Because investment in plant and equipment must be
complemented by building up learning capabilities (that is, learning to
learn, learning to borrow, learning to do and learning to use), history
matters.
Mr Brittan's reaction is to recall the role of entrepreneurship. However,
the heroic Schumpeterian figure, and even more the Hayekian agent of
arbitrage, is increasingly marginalised by developments in the global
economy. The most dynamic firms are acquiring and improving their
entrepreneurial capabilities in close co-operation with other firms and
public agencies. Similarly, successful national development strategies have
involved public support to learn, to experiment and to create. This is the
essence of the lessons to be derived from the experience of rapid growth in
east Asia, which belies many of the free market nostrums of the 1980s and
highlights the importance of public and private co-operation.
Second, while Samuel Brittan is still pondering the etiology of growth and
investment, endogenous growth theory is capturing important changes in the
global economy. In particular, the explosion in foreign direct investment,
which has contributed significantly to the diffusion of technology, to new
ways of organising business activity and to new forms of competition in the
global marketplace, can now receive the attention it deserves.
On all accounts, new growth theory has brought economists closer to
decision-making in Seoul and Tokyo, and now indeed in Washington. This,
rather than the spurious calculations of growth accountants, sets the
backdrop against which much-needed new policy initiatives can be formulated.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Letter: Wrong assumptions about investment flows in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN THOMSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is a dangerous notion about that there are winners and losers
from foreign direct investment ('Footloose across Europe's frontiers', March
9). If Britain attracts more investment than the rest of Europe, then it
must be a ringing endorsement of British policies, particularly towards
labour. The erroneous assumption is that companies are looking for the best
place to locate within the single market.
While that may be true in some cases, recent research at Chatham House
suggests that the vast bulk of investment flows in and out of the same set
of countries. The UK is the largest recipient in Europe but it is also the
largest investor. How are we to explain that on the basis of relocation
decisions? Like trade, direct investment is often used as a form of market
access by companies. Also like trade, investment is a positive sum game.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Letter: London in urgent need of transport investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER W CORFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Rail in London' (March 9), is right to highlight the
serious flaws in the logic upon which the rumoured postponement of Crossrail
is based. It should be borne in mind that the same manipulators of
statistics influenced the capacity of the M25 - a brilliant exercise in
forethought, analysis and planning for growth. In this case, they appear to
have overlooked the Paddington-to-Heathrow link, among other things.
There is little doubt that the transport infrastructure in and around London
is at crisis point and, political dogma apart, is in urgent need of
significant investment. If London is to retain its position in the premier
league of international financial centres that investment must be committed
now - and not just on rail projects.
Those responsible for traffic planning in the metropolis seem obsessed by
their need to manipulate congestion instead of adopting a longer-term policy
of providing diversity. There is no value in diverting the congested Al3
traffic on to the new Docklands highway if, as is likely, the result is
gridlock at Tower Hill. Similarly, there is no point in providing the
Channel tunnel termini at Stratford and Waterloo if the Jubilee Line is not
extended.
Your editorial is wrong, however, to compare Crossrail with the Jubilee
Line. Twenty-five per cent of the cost of the Jubilee Line extension will be
borne by the private sector, just as the Pounds 3.25bn public investment in
infrastructure has been matched by Pounds 12.5bn of private investment in
the area. Docklands is far from being a 'withered extremity'. It is alive,
confident in attitude and poised to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
Now all we need to do is apply the same formula to the rest of London.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Letter: Call to arms should be heeded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID A TURNBULL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In response to your recent articles, 'One more talking shop' (Observer,
March 2), and 'Ten-Point plan for credibility' (March 3) may I make the
following comments.
First, the cynicism of Observer's comment, 'hands up anyone who hasn't yet
formed a pro manufacturing industry lobby group?' is not becoming of your
newspaper. This article actually refers to three 'pro manufacturing lobby
groups'. Considering the dire state of the economy and in particular the
manufacturing sector therein and the government's apparent lack of belief,
interest or support, existence of such groups is hardly surprising.
Politicians and the government should pay more attention to the 'call to
arms' of dedicated, committed and active manufacturers, which have so far
managed to escape the effect of ineffective and inept policies promoted by
their political leaders.
Second, I admire the 10-point plan set out by Dr John Pendlebury and David
Shipley as it concurs almost exactly with what we in the UK Industrial Group
brought to the notice of the public in October 1992 to an extremely positive
press response, including your own newspaper.
May I draw your attention once again to the UK Industrial Group which is now
taking action on eight of this article's 10 points. Further liaison and
long-term planning is needed on the points concerning the education system.
May we therefore ask the government to back its sudden and vociferous
interest in manufacturing by communicating with these committed groups. In
particular, government should be taking note of the comments of these groups
to effect a long-term industrial based economic strategy for the ultimate
good of the UK and its people.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Asia as a region: A forum for co-operation should be
encouraged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We all know that China contains roughly a quarter of the human race. Given
that fact, it is remarkable how unimportant to the rest of the world it has
been and, as of this moment, still is. For Japan, despite its proximity,
China is no bigger a trading partner than Australia. As a market for British
exports, it is one-quarter the size of Australia, and only just bigger than
New Zealand.
Precisely because China is so vast, its energies until now were turned
inward. In the 19th and 20th centuries its development was held back by
internal upheavals, as well as by foreign interference and conquest. From
1949 to 1978 it was walled in by a draconian form of communism. But since
1979 China has been changing at breakneck speed. During the 1980s growth
averaged nearly 10 per cent a year, and after a brief dose of austerity
following the 1989 Tiananmen massacre it climbed again to 12 per cent last
year.
Some of the implications are spelt out by Peter Ferdinand, of the Royal
Institute of International Affairs, in a paper prepared for last weekend's
UK-Japan 2000 Group meeting at Awashima, near Tokyo. He refers to
'rudimentary calculations at the IMF' suggesting that on current growth
trends China could overtake Japan and become the second largest economy in
the world 'around or soon after the year 2000'.
Simple projections of current trends are nearly always wrong, of course. Mr
Ferdinand lists political, economic, environmental, administrative and
foreign policy problems that China now has to confront. But he also sees
similarities between China's development model and those of other east Asian
economies, which have sustained high growth for 20 years or more, based on a
high ratio of savings to gross domestic product.
Already there is a de facto 'Chinese economic area', linking Hong Kong and
Taiwan to the mainland. This in turn, says Mr Ferdinand, will be
increasingly integrated 'into the dynamism of the broader Asia-Pacific
region'.
It is thus quite plausible that Chinese growth will continue through this
decade at an average of 7 per cent, while exports rise from their current 17
per cent share of GDP to at least 20 per cent. In that case, China's share
of world trade could be 3.5 per cent by the year 2000 - the share that
Canada, a G7 member, has now.
China's military power will no doubt keep pace. It is currently buying large
numbers of SU 27 and MiG 31 fighters from Russia, and has shown interest in
acquiring an aircraft carrier from Ukraine.
Increasing defence expenditure is a general trend throughout the region. In
part, it reflects the increased spending power of states with rapidly
growing economies, but it also stems from a general insecurity. Peace, a
necessary condition for continued economic growth, is not taken for granted.
Indeed, many of China's neighbours are less inclined to take it for granted
than in the past, when the cold war made it reasonably certain that the US
would remain militarily engaged in the region.
Yet it is hard to believe that a regional arms race is the best way, either
to encourage the US to stay in the region or to compensate for its
withdrawal. What is needed is a multilateral political relationship which
would both reflect and ensure the growing interdependence of the region's
economies.
East Asians are quick to tell you that their region does not lend itself to
institutions such as Nato, the EC or the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe. It lacks a common cultural heritage, they say, and
even a clear geographical identity. The states of the region have divergent
interests and different political systems.
Behind these abstractions lurk more specific anxieties. Many fear a new
Japanese hegemony, while Japan (rather like the UK in Europe) fears being
forced to choose between a regional role and its special relationship with
the US. The US itself has discouraged the East Asian Economic Caucus
proposed by Malaysia, fearing it might lead to discrimination against US
exports.
Yet, ironically, the US has also, by pushing Japan to open its financial
markets, helped bring about the beginnings of a 'yen zone' in which the
dollar is losing ground. And there is no obvious reason why an Asian
economic grouping should be any more protectionist than the North American
free trade area. East Asia is even more dependent on international trade
than are North America and western Europe; and so has even less interest
than they do in a world of protectionist trading blocs.
The emergence of China as an economic power should make multilateral
relationships in Asia easier to manage because they would no longer
automatically be dominated by Japan. It also makes them more necessary. If
China is isolated it will remain suspicious of external powers, and more
inclined to rely on military strength for its security, which in turn will
make neighbouring states less secure.
What is needed is a forum in which China and other states interested in east
Asian security (which must include Russia and the US) can find ways of
reassuring each other about their military capabilities and political
intentions. The next post-ministerial conference of the Association of
South-East Asian Nations would be a good place to start.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Arts: Thick, and proud of it - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The proletarianisation of British television is proceeding apace. This is,
perhaps, no great surprise; after all, television in the US, commercial in
tooth and claw from the very beginning, has always been aimed straight - and
almost exclusively - at the tabloid market, and in the UK the writing has
been on the wall for five years. Like so many politicians, Thatcherites
never liked broadcasters whom they saw as unelected troublemakers. When Mrs
Thatcher was Prime Minister, Norman Tebbit (so charming, so civilised, so
urbane in BBC2's interview with David Dimbleby on Sunday) was set loose to
savage the broadcasters as only he knew how, while Mrs T herself listened to
the opinions of her favourite mass media mogul, Rupert Murdoch.
It was Mr Murdoch who, at the 1989 Edinburgh Television Festival, declared
that much of what passed for quality on British television - snobbish old
fashioned drama, for instance - was really no more than a reflection of the
values of the narrow elite which controlled broadcasting and had always
believed that its tastes were synonymous with quality. Just how these
pointy-headed snobs tricked the viewing millions into watching Brideshead
Revisited and Jewel In The Crown was something he did not explain. He did,
however, make it pretty clear that what was needed was a lot more channels
like his own, Sky, an opinion which he presumably impressed upon his friend
Margaret Hilda.
Whether or not we are talking here about direct cause and effect, a few
years later we find ourselves with a newly arranged broadcasting system in
which Channel 4 has to compete for ratings in a manner which was never
previously necessary, and the ITV companies are driven into a vortex of
market competition in order to find the money to pay back the millions which
they had to bid at auction to acquire their franchises, not to mention the
Treasury tax. The BBC meanwhile declares that, as a result of the changes in
the industry, it will inevitably lose a third of its audience over the next
few years.
The outcome, on screen, is that the Reithian principles on which
broadcasting in this country has traditionally rested are now being turned
upside down. Reith believed that you should aim programmes slightly above
the intellectual level of your expected audience and thus keep encouraging
people to improve themselves. A growing number of programmes now appearing
on our screens do the opposite: rather than helping the audience up, they
drag the subject down, seeking a level where it can appeal to the most
casual channel zapper.
Thus Harry Enfield's Guide To Opera on Channel 4 is got up to look quite
literally like a comedy. Enfield and Paul Whitehouse who have been so hugely
successful in such double-acts as Smashie and Nicey, the disc jockeys in
Harry Enfield's Television Programme, appear here as Dad and Son, a couple
of cheeky chappy cockneys (apparently the sort of people we should admire
for liking opera) and also as The Opera Ponces who enthuse over the more
arcane aspects of opera in public school accents (and therefore, it seems,
deserve our contempt). Mr Murdoch should be delighted.
The opening episode contained lots of famous extracts, interestingly using
Opera North and Paul Daniel as the 'resident' company rather than the ENO or
Covent Garden as might have been expected, and it was very funny. Enfield's
thumbnail sketch of a typical opera - 'Act 1, bird comes on, warbles . . .
Act 3, mixture of snogging and violence . . . Act 4, one of the blokes has a
bit of a sing by himself, reads a letter from his mum . . .' was hilariously
accurate. Perhaps the series will, indeed, induce some of those who know
opera only via the World Cup signature tune and the Three Tenors concert to
buy some CDs or even a ticket for an actual performance.
But you can hardly miss the dramatic contrast in tone between this series
and, say, Civilisation which, though made 25 years ago, has continued to
typify - or serve as the great example of - arts programmes on British
television until now. Kenneth Clark would not have referred to an opera
audience as 'smug gits in dinner jackets', one of several phrases from
Enfield which reeked of snobbery, albeit the inverted sort. Would smug gits
really become more worthwhile in his eyes if they wore shell suits from C&amp;A?
A similar attitude of 'I'm thick and I'm proud of it' has permeated the
first two episodes of A Year In Provence on BBC1. In previous years a series
about a couple throwing up middle class life in London to live in an old
stone farmhouse in southern France would probably have accepted Provencal
life on its own terms and enthused over the unfamiliar culture. But that
would hardly have held the attention of the channel-hopping soccer fan,
would it, so here we get the soccer fan attitude to abroad.
Froggies are daft foreigners who insist on speaking a barmy foreign
language, they're all wind and show, incapable of sticking to a job for more
than a day, and everything from their driving to their weather is deeply
doubtful. Subtitles, as Mr Murdoch would doubtless explain, are
disgracefully elitist, and so we have two embarrassingly awful substitutes:
Lindsay Duncan as the wife translates anything which is spoken in French, so
that the dialogue moves at snail's pace, and John Thaw as the husband speaks
Franglais: 'Le problem is les pipes. Burstez' or 'Qui est le woman maniac
avec le black voiture?' The appeal is to precisely that sort of xenophobic
mentality which has become so familiar in recent years from television's
coverage of the British soccer fan abroad.
The dragging down of the level of appeal is not limited to arts programmes
and drama. More and more television journalism is now concerned primarily
with entertainment. Much of it, such as Life and CD, as was noted here two
weeks ago, is bitty and sensational. Even among more serious programmes such
as ITV's Disguises there is a concentration on 'human interest' which is
certainly attractive and may at first seem quite reasonable but which proves
on subsequent inspection to involve the abandonment of that
contextualisation and analysis at which British current affairs programmes
had become rather good. For the first two programmes in the Disguises series
Adam Holloway has played a schizophrenic living rough and seeking medical
help and accommodation. They have provided a vivid illustration of the
failure of the 'care in the community' theory which the government used to
close down so many wards in mental hospitals. But they have not extended
thought beyond that vividness.
If this is the evidence on screen a mere 10 weeks after the introduction of
the new system, how will matters look after 10 months? It seems clear
already that the increase in competition for audiences is going to become
keener yet. Perhaps Alan Yentob, who has done such a good job with BBC2 and
now been asked to take over BBC1, will manage the amazing feat of improving
quality on the corporation's more popular channel without losing too large a
proportion of the audience. But that still leaves ITV and Channel 4 to worry
about, and of course the satellite and cable networks which - we are now
assured - could be offering 500-channel systems, thanks to digital
compression, in a matter of months rather than years.
The claim has always been that when the technology finally overcomes network
scarcity we can all stop griping about programme quality because the choices
will be infinitely varied: television, like print, will provide everything
from a solid diet of pornography or comic trivia to a balanced diet of grand
opera, serious journalism and high quality drama. I wonder.

In the past few years Britain, or more accurately you and I, have paid
billions of pounds replacing the rates system with the poll tax. Now we are
paying billions of pounds to replace the poll tax with the council tax
 .which looks remarkably like the rates system. Dispatches (9.00 C4) looks
at the way key decisions were taken while public attention was directed
elsewhere, and at the politicians most closely involved. Margaret Thatcher
promised in 1974 that she would abolish the rates, , but Nigel Lawson, as
Chancellor of the Exchequer, fought against the idea. It may be worth
remembering that the BBC2 drama series Mr Wroe's Virgins (9.25) only claims
to be based partly on real events. Today's story about Hannah, an atheist
and socialist who becomes involved in the political struggles of the Ashton
spinners, sounds as though it should fit in remarkably well with the beliefs
of the women's movement in the 1990s (well, 1970s and 80s, anyway). QED
focuses on Mike Burrows, inventor of the 'superbike' on which Chris Boardman
won a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics.(9.30 BBC1).

FT  10 MAR 93 / Arts: La Damnation de Faust - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Berlioz work with the highest tally of opera-house performances is not
one of his three operas but La Damnation de Faust, the Goethe-inspired
'dramatic legend' written for the concert hall. Berlioz's libretto is decked
with stage directions ('Distant sounds, rustic and war-like, begin to
disturb the calm of the pastoral scene') which nevertheless are intended to
be executed in the listener's imagination.
'La Damnation', David Cairns has written, 'has the character of a dream' -
lightning-swift in the modulation of mood and passage of incident, shaped
with a dramatic logic unarguable but impalpable, carried on a current of
brilliantly coloured and beautiful musical invention, an opera not of the
stage but (Cairns's words) 'the mind's eye'. So is any attempt to realise it
theatrically an act of artistic hubris? Is it sheer producer's pride,
designer's delirium, management mania that brought La Damnation de Faust to
the Coliseum in 1969 (revived 1980), and that now brings it to Covent Garden
for the first time since 1933?
Answers to those questions will surely be as numerous and as diverse as the
audience-members themselves; the minority who at Monday evening's curtain
calls made plain their dissatisfaction with Harry Kupfer's new Covent Garden
staging, in the designs of Hans Schavernoch (sets) and Reinhard Heinrich
(costumes), deserve tolerance and even sympathy. Myself, I sat utterly
dazzled and enchanted, drinking in the kaleidoscope of visual images
counterpointed with the music, convinced (at least temporarily) that this
must be the most completely ravishing score of the entire 19th century, and
longing at the close for an instant repeat performance.
For me, indeed, this was two-and-a-half hours (unbroken by interval) of
music-theatre magic. The engagement for the occasion of the world's leading
Berlioz conductor is of inestimable benefit: a Damnation of Faust production
considerably less mercurial than Kupfer's, less deeply imbued with
Berliozian intelligence, irony and Romantic passion, would no doubt still
take wing as a result of Colin Davis's lifelong involvement in the music.
Michael Geliot's 1969 Coliseum staging employed a combination of projected
images and processional devices to attempt a theatrical encapsulation of
Berlioz's dream-dramaturgy. (Film has often been claimed as the work's ideal
medium, although so far no-one has managed to put that belief to the test.)
Kupfer works with simpler materials - gauzes, flying and trollied props,
light-flashes, giant dolls - which he compounds with speed and legerdemain,
in ways that evoke the manifold pleasures of 'naive' theatrical experience
while simultaneously throwing out complex reflections about the work itself.
The basic set is a 19th-century theatre auditorium, with boxes and a central
glass door: old Faust enters it in silence at the start, a refugee from a
snow-bound world. (La Damnation de Faust was given its concert-performance
premiere in a Paris opera house - the Paris Opera-Comique - on a day in
November 1846 when ferocious fierce snow-flurries contributed to the work's
poor attendance and reception.)
Into whatever form and guise it develops in the course of the evening, the
relationship between this Faust - or Faust-Berlioz, one soon comes to think
of him - and this theatre-within-a-theatre is held at a remove: he wanders
through the staging as through a landscape filled with fleshly delights to
which he is alien, a world coarse in bourgeois manners and crudely
militarised, an environment he can only dominate by submitting to the
dictates of an embodied negative conscience.
Poetic irony is the key to Kupfer's Berlioz vision, an irony achieved in a
succession of fluidly forming and dissolving theatrical images which the
spectator is invited to absorb into his experience of the score, his
awareness of its composer, its literary sources, its period of creation, its
position in the history of Romantic artistic expression.
Almost everything in the staging manifests profound sympathy with the
precise quality and character of the musical invention: the sardonic
whipcrack of Mephisto's exchanges, the hollow exhilarations of the martial
sequences, the exquisitely elusive lyricism of Marguerite's doomed passion.
Even in the ending - Kupfer devises here an effect of Brechtian alienation
which wholly undermines the heavenly-salvation finale, and which will prove
the production's most controversial feature - faith is kept with Berlioz's
tracing of (as Cairns puts it) 'the defeat of the Romantic dream'.
Davis's Damnation de Faust reading has matured. Energy, intensity of colour
and line, command of rhythm are still its notable characteristics, enriched
now by an 'inner' awareness of musical sense and direction that fills every
note with an extraordinary iridescent glow. On a keyed-up first night, with
so sophisticated a staging to attend to, pit and stage were not always
exactly co-ordinated (a substitute Brander who lost his way caused problems
in the Tavern scene). But already there were marvels of idiomatic playing
and choral singing to relish - and no doubt these will be infinitely
increased during the run.
The star of the show is Samuel Ramey, in magnificent form as Mephistopheles,
singing with the fastidious control of tone, line and word that marks the
natural Berliozian, and playing with a masterly balance of wit, seriousness
and menace. Jerry Hadley's tenor, excellently well suited to the French
repertory, sounded on Monday a little dry in its lower reaches, a little too
ready to fall into rasping parlando; his Faust is an alert, personable,
quick-spirited figure.
Olga Borodina's beautifully full, soft-textured, wide-ranging mezzo-soprano
lacks the admirable distinctness of verbal delivery of both her colleagues:
altogether, this opening-night Marguerite was a sketch which will surely be
filled out during the run. I wish I could witness that filling-out process;
I wish I could attend all remaining five performances]

FT  10 MAR 93 / Arts: With spring in their steps - Clement Crisp reviews
young dancers at the Paris Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A dancer's life is short, and youthful promise has a nasty habit of fading
away, either by reason of neglect or because of the pressures within a
ballet company. The golden gift we saw at graduation - or thought we saw -
turns to some baser material as time passes, and occasional soloist roles
are the reward for what once seemed a talent to storm the heights. The Paris
Opera Ballet has in latter years set aside evenings in the Palais Garnier to
celebrate the potential of its youngest dancers, so that the Paris public
(always very partisan) may judge the gifted young, and the gifted young may
have moments of glory as a reward for talent, and a taste of greater rewards
to come.
The evenings are tremendously exciting. A clue to the Opera's dance style
lies in display, in assured prowess, in the assertion of 'moi'. Some years
ago, in Natalia Makarova's Ballerina series for BBC TV, shots of class at
the Opera superb Ballet School found the teacher urging her girls to show
plus de chic; beaucoup plus de chic. It's a phrase which sums up a lot about
attitudes at the school and in the company. Technique, the presentation of
the dance, is glossy, and has that wit which is an essential component of
chic. Russian young can look soulful (though sublime) by comparison.
Americans may appear hard-driven in attack; the English somewhat demure.
Most of the young French, if not all - as I saw on Saturday night - take the
stage with an allure that speaks of confidence and a clear sense of their
identity. At worst they are over-vivacious: at best they are world-beaters.
The programme, given on three successive evenings, comprised pas de deux and
extracts from the repertory. All may not have been for the best all the time
 -a version of the Fairy variations from the Sleeping Beauty prologue did no
justice to Petipa, for the Russian classics lie outside the Opera's
traditions; Agon is not for the inexperienced - but the sum effect was of a
company (and a teaching tradition) marvellously rich. There were several
exceptional talents. A duet from Le Papillon with Isabelle Ciavara (aged 20)
and Emmanuel Thibault (just 18) was heart-touching. Mlle Ciavara is slight,
enchantingly pretty, and delights in the intricacies of quick, clear, tiny
steps: the old Russian ballerinas used to call such choreography 'weaving
lace with your feet'. Mlle Ciavara turns, hold a floating pose, is sweetly
true in this reconstruction of a mid-19th century spectacle. M Thibault is
of medium height - Baryshnikov, Julio Bocca, his models - and already
possessor of a beautifully rounded technique. Marvels are easily done, but
more enthralling is his ability to devour space, to race and soar, and seem
a meteor. Like Mlle Ciaravola, his manner is still innocent; I long to see
them both in Coppelia.
A grand contrast came with Aurelie Dupont in Balanchine's Tchaikovsky pas de
deux. Winner of the junior gold medal in last year's Varna Ballet
Competition, she has an all-conquering skill, but it is allied to a
lusciousness of pose (her back, torso, have a fluidity and power more
Russian than French) and to an innate musical sensibility. Her manner is
serious - if she flirts with anything, it is with the phrasing of the dance,
and that she does divinely - and I hope the world will be hers, for she
seems destined for great things. She had as companion the young but already
established, and splendid, Nicolas Le Riche ,hero of the recent house
revival of Le Train Bleu. The pas de deux was radiant.
Ghislaine Fallou is another exceptional talent. She, too, revealed a dignity
of presence, a lovely clarity of pose and grace of phrasing. She needed all
these to redeem Ben Stevenson's Three Preludes in which she was trapped with
her partner, the elegant Yann Bridart. The dance amounts to hollow emotings
to Rakhmaninov - it is a faked choreographic orgasm - but these devoted
artists gave the movement a sincerity which redounds enormously to their
credit. Another rescue operation was performed by Delphine Baey and Emmanuel
Hoff in the duet from William Forsythe's In the middle. Mlle Baey produced
the dead-pan force, the far-flung limbs and the general air of aggressive
boredom that the piece demands. I would love to see her in a ballet: she is
a physically dramatic dancer, excellently matched by M. Hoff.
There were other young performers on view, their moments of glory well
merited. How good to see a great national troupe able and willing to salute
its next generation. And in matter of dance, it is worth urging any visitor
to Paris to the Matisse show at the Beaubourg, where you can see the
Petersburg version of La Danse, its movement as thrilling as the activities
of the apprentice angels at the Palais Garnier.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: A bridge too far - Plans for a
road-rail link between Sweden and Denmark are causing controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE KIRWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demolition work has started near Copenhagen's Kastrup Airport, but the
buildings are not coming down to make way for a new runway. The space is
needed for the approaches to a planned Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4.2bn) road and
rail project which has raised the hackles of environmentalists, politicians,
and the public and severely embarrassed the Swedish and Danish governments.
The controversial bridge-tunnel between the two countries is designed to
stretch for 17km and carry vehicles and trains. With another bridge in lower
Denmark, due to open in 1995, it would provide an important commercial
transport link between northern and southern Europe.
The bridge's numerous opponents say the Danish and Swedish governments have
not conducted required environmental impact assessments. They also contend
the proposal goes against the international positions taken by both
Scandinavian nations on issues such as climatic change, transport and marine
protection. Although they signed the climate change treaty at the Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the increased traffic, and thus greenhouse gases,
resulting from the bridge counter that commitment, say environmentalists.
The polluted Baltic Sea is another issue. The bridge would span a crucial
strait that is a narrow lifeline of salt water and oxygen for the sea's
already ravaged ecosystem. Both governments - together with the other
nations bordering the Baltic Sea - recently signed an international
convention aimed at improving the Baltic water quality.
Officials from Sweden and the new Danish administration say all
environmental concerns will be satisfied before the bridge-tunnel
construction begins.
'We can only say that everyone has to trust us to consider all the
environmental concerns,' says Jaerel Turdin, head of planning at the Swedish
environment ministry. 'Government approval will not be given before all
these concerns are satisfied.'
While some bridge opponents might dismiss Turdin's promises, the Centre
party, of which she is a member, voted against the bridge in 1991. That was
before Sweden's Social Democratic party fell from power and the
non-socialist coalition, including her party, took over.
Last month, bridge opponents gained a significant victory in the battle to
stop the bridge when two key environmental review panels recommended against
the bridge-tunnel plans. However, Sweden's prime minister, Carl Bildt, whose
conservative Moderate party favours the bridge, says 'sooner or later' it
will be built.
In Denmark, the political situation concerning the bridge is just as
muddled. The new Social Democratic government appointed in January also
includes political parties that voted against the bridge in a parliamentary
vote in 1991.
It was in the summer of that year that the governments signed a bilateral
agreement to build a train-car bridge linking the Swedish city of Malmo and
Copenhagen.
The resulting parliamentary votes enraged not only environmental groups, but
also political parties in Sweden and Denmark. 'The decision agreed between
the two governments was wrong because it committed the two nations to a
train-car bridge between Malmo and Copenhagen,' says Bjorn Gillberg, one of
Sweden's most prominent environmental advocates. 'The governments didn't
say: 'We want a bridge that will cause the least amount of environmental
damage and which also provides the least expensive option.' Therefore the
agreement disregarded an option such as a train tunnel.'
This is the alternative that most bridge opponents prefer if there is to be
a fixed link. 'The agreement also disregarded a bridge or a tunnel between
Helsingborg (in Sweden) and Helsingor (in Denmark), where the distance
across the water is only a few kilometres.'
Following the 1991 agreement, a consortium of Danish and Swedish consultants
was established and a bridge-tunnel design drawn up. The blueprint calls for
a bridge from Sweden to an artificial island several kilometres off Denmark.
From there to the Danish shore, a fixed tunnel would be lowered into the
sea.
With the design work, the consortium spent more than Dollars 5m on an
environmental impact assessment. Recognising the stiff opposition, it
persuaded Gillberg, who has spent a lifetime fighting environmentally
damaging projects, to oversee the study.
When the environmental impact survey was completed last autumn, it was
sharply criticised by environmental groups, as well as by the Swedish
government's Environmental Protection Agency. The failure to examine
alternatives was a significant complaint.
'The consortium was given a direct mandate from the governments,' Gillberg
explains. 'They called for a train-car bridge between Malmo and Copenhagen
and that is what was studied. So it is wrong to blame the consortium for not
studying the alternatives.'
One contentious issue is the effect of proposed dredging, which is supposed
to compensate for the blockage of salt and oxygenated water caused by the
bridge's large pilings. The impact study claimed deeper shipping channels
would maintain adequate salt water inflow.
'Nobody knows if the dredging will work or not,' says Mats Abrahamson, a
marine biologist with Greenpeace in Sweden. 'They have only computer models.
The only place where the salt water reaches the Baltic will also be
obstructed by the other new bridge that will be completed next year.' He
adds: 'Maybe, we could take a chance if the Baltic Sea was not in such
fragile condition already. But this could be the nail in the coffin.'
The controversy has involved the EC Commission. 'Originally, the Commission
said the bridge violated the 1985 EC directive on environmental impact
assessment,' says Jan Sundergaard, a Greenpeace official in Denmark. 'But
last November, after opposition against the Commission grew in Europe and
subsidiarity became such an issue, the Commission dropped the bridge case.'
Engineering and architectural companies in Europe are keen to obtain work
from the bridge project. The problem is that it is still not clear what will
be built and a final decision is some way off.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Casting doubt on green
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of going green is still a worry for many businesses, and
environmental costs are expected to rise sharply, according to a new report*
by consultants P-E International.
The companies' comments come as evidence emerges from the oil industry that
the annual costs of pollution control will have risen by 50 per cent in less
than a decade and the costs may be handicapping the companies' ability to
invest.
After years of regarding environmental measures as a cost, ministers and
environmental consultants are now fond of proclaiming, almost as an axiom,
that greener means richer. However, these figures on the real impact on
businesses' costs suggest many companies are right to question whether
environmental investment really represents an opportunity.
The report says 'over two thirds of companies expect operating costs to
increase as a result of addressing environmental issues'. More than three
quarters attribute the need for changes to EC directives, compared with 47
per cent citing UK legislation as a source of pressure.
The survey, which analyses 250 companies about their 'logistics' - every
part of the supply chain from buying raw materials to distribution and
packaging - was conducted together with David Bellamy Associates, a
subsidiary of P-E run partly by David Bellamy, the environmentalist. It
adds: 'There is considerable uncertainty about the commercial benefits of
responding to many environmental concerns. A large proportion of companies,
therefore, intend to wait until they are forced into action by legislation'.
Like many consultancy reports, the survey argues: 'The ability to be
pro-active . . . will determine which companies will prosper'. But the
evidence for this conclusion is not fully supported by the report.
Although P-E found that where the companies had taken environmental steps
such as reducing packaging there was 'a very significant cost reduction
element', this does not demonstrate that environmental measures can be in a
company's financial interest so much as raise questions about why the
management had neglected to take the steps earlier.
Jan Szymankiewicz, managing director of P-E's logistics consulting arm,
argues that companies which anticipate environmental legislation have the
chance to adapt more gradually and cheaply than those that leave it to the
last minute. While this is plausible, plenty of exceptions can be envisaged,
particularly where the relevant environmental technology is changing fast to
the benefit of those companies which wait.
Szymankiewicz agrees, too, that environmental investment could lead to a
competitive disadvantage for companies exporting to regions with different
environmental rules: 'It is probably true that they will have higher costs
(because of compliance with the green rules).'
Evidence to support that concern is emerging from the oil industry. The
Petroleum Industry Association, in an informal poll of its members, has
found that their total investment will rise from an average of around Pounds
170m a year in the last three years to Pounds 270m a year over the next five
years.
However, the association has also found that the companies' total investment
spending has scarcely risen, suggesting environmental investment may be
squeezing out other spending that could improve competitiveness.
There are no clear-cut answers to whether environmental investment is a
burden or an opportunity for businesses - they are buried in the companies'
figures for operating costs, investment and market share. As the impact of
compliance with recent legislation on companies becomes clear, some of the
rhetoric about environmental investment may give way to a clearer picture of
what companies can be expected to deliver.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Demands from the suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK catering company received more than 40 different questionnaires on its
environmental credentials from prospective clients. Other companies have had
similar experiences as businesses begin to apply a green filter to their
buying.
'Some of the questions were dubious in terms of their value to environment
issues, such as queries about our turnover,' says Roger Brown of Sutcliffe
Catering, a subsidiary of P&amp;O. 'I think it is essential to have a code of
practice governing the sorts of questions that need to be asked.'
Business in the Environment, the charity backed by industry and Prince
Charles, is working with consultants KPMG to develop such a code. It will be
backed by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. 'The idea is to
produce voluntary guidelines which will help both customers and suppliers by
introducing consistency into the way in which environmental performance is
assessed,' says Martin Houldin of KPMG.
B&amp;Q, the UK do-it-yourself chain, insists that all its suppliers comply with
a comprehensive environmental checklist. It was the first big retailer in
the UK to take the initiative and has worked with its suppliers to help them
conform to its required standards.
'We now know far more about our products and we can talk with greater
confidence because we have exposed our skeletons. It helps us manage the
business that much better,' says Alan Knight, B&amp;Q's environment specialist.
Large buyers, such as BT and IBM UK, also include environmental criteria in
their specifications. These companies might be less susceptible than
retailers to consumer pressure, but neither wants their image tainted by the
environmental misdemeanours of suppliers.
The effects of buyers' environmental demands have begun to percolate down
the supply chain. 'For many small companies who are not directly affected by
new laws, it is often the first time that they have had to think about the
environment in business terms,' says Edwin Datschefski of the Environment
Council, a charity that promotes good environmental practice in business.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Management: Wasting time in the boardroom - Meetings stifle
ideas, delay decision-making and diffuse responsibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A meeting is a group of people who keep minutes and waste hours. Yet
research shows the average middle to senior manager may spend as much as 40
per cent of his or her day in meetings.
According to a survey of the working habits of 135 managers published by the
Industrial Society and BBC Education last week, respondents spent the
equivalent of almost a day a week in internal meetings.
The number of committee, sub-committee, task-force, and board meetings that
business people are required to sit on grows exponentially with rank.
Meetings are known to be inefficient. They stifle ideas, postpone and
prevaricate. A committee meeting has been described as a group of the
unwilling, picked from the unfit, to do the unnecessary.
Given such criticisms why are meetings so popular? Meetings may be seen as a
good way to pool resources. Similarly, it has been argued that members may
stimulate each other through discussion - what is known as the synergy
effect. Others describe them as an efficient and democratic way to
communicate with people. Still others believe committees make better
decisions.
These reasons are not convincing. First, most meetings are held not to make
decisions but to avoid them. Further they are mainly about diffusion of
responsibility so that if a wrong, poor or costly decision is made, fault is
spread over all committee members.
There are three significant problems with meetings that render them
inefficient.
The first is sometimes called social loafing. More than 50 years ago a
German scientist named Ringelmann asked workers to pull as hard as they
could on a rope attached to a meter that measured the strength of their
efforts. Subjects worked alone and in groups of two, three and eight.
While the total amount of force on the rope increased as group size rose,
the amount of effort by each person seemed to drop. While one person pulling
alone exerted an average of 63kg of force, this dropped to about 53kg in
groups of three and was reduced to about 31kg in groups of eight. The
greater the number of people performing the task, the less effort each one
expended.
The impact or effect of any social force directed towards a group from an
outside source (eg a manager) is divided among its members. Thus, the more
persons in the group, the less the impact such force will have upon each.
Because they are working with others, each group member feels they will take
up any slack resulting from reduced effort on their part. And since all
members tend to respond in this fashion, average output per person drops
sharply.
The second problem is called by psychologists evaluation apprehension. It
suggests that when trying to make decisions in groups, the presence of some
group members may intimidate others. The voicing of unpopular, if correct,
ideas may breed conflict and may be a 'career-limiting' move.
It should come as no surprise that high-status persons in organisations,
such as presidents and chief executives, are carefully listened to and their
words given high credence. As a result they tend to dominate group
situations and their ideas (right and wrong) are frequently accepted without
question. The result can easily be a group of 'yes men/women' behind the
single dominant force.
Understanding this phenomenon, former General Motors head Alfred P Sloan did
not attend the early phase of his groups' meeting, fearing his presence
would discourage honest discussions of critical problems among executives,
who would insist on pleasing him. There is reason to believe Sloan's status
would have had an undue impact on the group by inadvertently encouraging
uniformity.
The third problem is that in creativity-type tasks, groups rather than
individuals working alone produce poorer decisions. In contrast to
well-structured tasks that can be divided into several discrete parts and
have a definite solution, many everyday management decisions are more poorly
structured.
If an organisation is faced with a decision over the prospect of a declining
market for its products it would be expected that a group meeting would do a
better job of handling such a problem than an individual.
But this is generally not the case. Most research has shown that in
poorly-structured, problem-solving, creative tasks, individuals show
superior performance to groups. This generalisation has important - and
potentially devastating - implications for organisations since some
administrators spend up to 80 per cent of their time in committee meetings.
As for business meetings - the fewer the better. It is best to follow some
simple rules:
Start promptly, no matter who is missing.
Why not have meetings standing up; the Queen does so in Privy Council.
Go around the room to ensure full participation.
Have occasional secret ballots on whether regular meetings are necessary.
Pool ideas and evaluate them but do not have a meeting to generate them.

FT  10 MAR 93 / People: Pointon York picks non-executives
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Geoffrey Pointon, chairman of financial services group Pointon York and an
enthusiastic proponent of investor protection, has overcome his distaste for
non-executive directors and appointed two to his board.
'I don't fancy non-executive directors that arrive once a month for a big
lunch and don't understand what is going on,' says Pointon, who adds that
with a banking subsidiary as part of the group, he has to find people
acceptable to the Bank of England, something he says has got increasingly
difficult recently. 'What with their views and my views, it hasn't been
easy.'
Now two longstanding acquaintances have agreed to come aboard; Ian Martin
(below left), 40, group director of Barings in charge of worldwide finance
operations and administration and a director of the Securities and Futures
Authority; and Hugh Armstrong (below right), 58, a venture capital
specialist who was a founder-director of one of the first venture capital
companies, the Small Business Capital Fund which, as Development Capital,
was eventually sold to form Lazard Ventures. Martin also goes on the board
of the bank. 'It reflects the progress the group has been making. Ten years
ago we were a very small outfit indeed,' says Pointon.
PYV, the Lloyd's broking subsidiary of the group which specialises in
professional indemnity cover, is suing Fimbra after the self-regulatory body
dropped at the 11th hour a compulsory indemnity scheme for its members to
which PYV was to have been the exclusive broker.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Management: Driven towards leanness - Rolls-Royce Motors has
radically transformed its working practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today's annual results from the UK engineering group Vickers will once again
bear the scar of big losses from its luxury car subsidiary Rolls-Royce. But
according to a confident Peter Ward, Rolls' chairman and chief executive,
'there'll be black ink' at the operating level next time.
Ward can make this claim because of the way the company has quietly been
undergoing a revolution along Japanese 'lean manufacturing' lines.
Traditional working practices have been overturned, employee numbers have
been cut from 5,200 to 2,490 and the break-even level of production has been
reduced to less than 1,400 cars a year from 2,800 in October 1991.
By any standards that is a considerable achievement, though, as Ward admits,
urgent action was required. Rolls was certainly forced to slim down in
response to the previous car market collapse in the early 1980s  - but
inevitably costs got out of control again during the unprecedented
eight-year bull market which reached its apogee for Rolls in 1990 with
record sales of 3,300.
Even at the slashed breakeven level, Rolls-Royce would have made further
losses last year with sales of just 1,378.
But Ward points out the changes in company organisation first put in train
at the end of 1990 mean Rolls needs only a slight sales lift this year for
operating profitability to be restored. It will take much more time to
reduce the company's daunting debt burden: Rolls will have been largely
responsible for an expected rise in Vickers' total indebtedness to around
Pounds 110m by the end of last year.
The enormous changes in production process and labour organisation are
evident all over the sprawling facilities at Crewe, Cheshire.
'It is simply a different business. We've turned it round,' says Ward.
The spur for change came from a growing fear that due to the Gulf war, the
imposition of a luxury goods tax and doubled 'gas guzzler' taxes in its
prized US market, and gathering recession elsewhere, the company's very
survival could be in doubt.
'So we asked ourselves, if we had a greenfield site how would we run it? We
went away and created a plan of a greenfield site, and decided to make it
happen on the old one,' Ward said.
Out of the exercise emerged a 'green book' forming the basis of new working
practices and factory organisation which would sweep away old demarcation
lines, create Japanese-style working teams and the concept that any
individual unit within the plant was the customer of another.
The plant was divided into 16 zones, each encouraged under a manager to act
as a business within a business and assuming full responsibility for cost,
quality, delivery and even materials purchased. Within the zones work 160
teams, typically six to 10 strong.
Out went charge hands and foremen, leaving a flatter management structure of
just four levels. Within the teams there is total flexibility regardless of
individuals' craft backgrounds.
The 120 union representatives - reflecting Rolls' broad craft traditions -
were reduced to 47 and just seven elected to the joint works-staff
negotiating committee. Such dissent as there was came from local convenor
level, not from national union leaders.
It was a radical approach, inevitably provoking great scepticism. But
negotiations on its introduction were finished by March 1991.
'The biggest problem was middle management trying to protect status quo,'
recalls Bernard Preston, director of quality.
Preston recalls recently having a senior Mazda manager visit the plant. 'He
said we've gone further than a Japanese plant could go. Here we've got
people on Pounds 40,000 working together on the same team with someone on
Pounds 280 a week. They couldn't do that in Japan.'
Rolls' teams are becoming acclimatised to their new-found freedom - and
responsibilities. The sense of commitment and 'proprietorship' has been
heightened, says Preston, by changes such as a member of one of the
four-engine assembly teams spending three hours assembling one engine, not
the previous 34 minutes doing specific taskes. It has become 'his' engine.
Butch Wilson, a former fitter, makes clear he has no resentments about
income disparities with the engineers on the engine teams: 'We help them;
they help us and within a couple of hours we get almost any problems
solved.'
The results, says zone manager Chris Johnson, are already apparent. One
measure - the number of rectifications per car - has gone from 150 to 47,
'and the faults themselves are getting smaller'. The team approach means
that even in the tradition-steeped interior trim area, the upholstering of
the complex rear seat squab now requires nine hours, not 27.
The changes are not confined to labour organisation.
The almost total closure of Rolls' London coachbuilding facility, Mulliner
Park Ward, nearly three years ago and the transfer of most of its operation
to Crewe means the plant has gone from making one model range to four.
With the introduction of more computer numerically controlled machining
equipment Rolls is making many more of its complex components in-house and
in greater variety. It is out-sourcing simple items such as fasteners which
it traditionally has made itself.
With Rolls' inventories slashed, senior managers say they are becoming able
to differentiate between suppliers who already work with Japanese car makers
in the UK and those who do not, 'and have the old adversarial attitudes'.
With more disciplined production planning, Rolls is now talking to suppliers
about delivering straight to its assembly line.
For the first time in the company's history, shop floor employees are
attending product events so that they can appreciate customer reaction at
first hand.
Managers say the working system has reached the stage where it is gaining
its own momentum, with managers no longer having to push. But no one is
under any illusions about the formidable task still ahead in terms of
financial recovery.

FT  10 MAR 93 / People: Sommer moves from US to Sony Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sony is strengthening its marketing focus in Europe with the appointment of
Ron Sommer to the post of president and chief operating officer. He will
take up his appointment in April.
He joins Jack Schmuckli, chairman and chief executive of Sony's European
operations, in establishing a US-style top management team to oversee the
company's sales, marketing and manufacturing operations. The heads of the
sales and marketing companies will report directly to Sommer.
Now 43, Sommer has been president and chief operating officer of Sony
Corporation of America since 1990. A math-ematician born in Israel and
educated at Vienna University, he joined Sony in 1980 and six years later
was appointed president of Sony Germany.
His early experience was in the computer industry with the former
high-flying Nixdorf Computer, now merged into Siemens Nixdorf Information
Systems. At one stage he was head of the company's largest subsidiary,
Nixdorf France.
Colleagues describe him as analytical and energetic with the ability to
motivate his staff.
He will need all those talents to sustain Sony's impetus through Europe's
long-lasting recession.

FT  10 MAR 93 / People: Philosopher Scholar for the Welsh Office
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new permanent secretary at the Welsh Office is to be a Treasury
philosopher. Michael Scholar, who will take over when Sir Richard Lloyd
Jones retires at the end of July, is currently deputy secretary at the
Treasury in charge of civil service management and pay. But he started his
working life as a philosophy teacher at Leicester University - his special
interests were Wittgenstein and Aristotle.
Since joining the civil service in 1969, Scholar, 51, has taken several
front-line positions. He was private secretary to Joel (now Lord) Barnett
when he was chief secretary to the Treasury in the run-up to the arrival of
the IMF in 1976. He was also private secretary to Margaret Thatcher from
1981-83, through the depths of the economic recession and the Falklands war.
Between 1979 and 1981, he was seconded to Barclays Bank International.
Unusually for a Treasury man, Scholar is noted for his sense of humour and
his lateral thinking. He is also an accomplished musician, playing the piano
and organ; an Associate of the Royal College of Organists, he is a noted
accompanist. Promotion to the Welsh Office takes him home - although brought
up in London, Scholar was born in Merthyr Tydfil.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Jobs: Such are the laws of the jungle - The dynamics of
organisational daftness that top managements do not see fit to study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUDDENLY the Jobs column understands how its family's spaniel Max must have
felt when the unaccompanied bull mastiff began gnawing him the other day.
True, I'd often heard fellow-journalists quoting 'dog eats dog' as a motto
of our trade - a second is 'there's always another quarter of an hour' - but
the meaning of the first one, at least, had never been really brought home
to me.
So it was in peaceful mood that I began thumbing through a slim volume sent
in by Economist Books, called 'Pocket MBA' and evidently written mainly by
The Economist's former management editor Tim Hindle.
There was certainly nothing to ruffle the calm in the earlier chapters
consisting of the usual propaganda for courses leading to master's degrees
in business administration, a potted history of management literature and
such, although I should perhaps have been warned by seeing that the bit on
sources of business information nowhere mentions the Financial Times. Nor
was my peace disturbed when the first item in the book's main section, a
glossary of management ideas and gurus, turned out to have familiar
associations.
Headed 'Abilene Paradox', it read: 'A paradox first stated by an American
psychologist called Jerry Harvey. He noticed that groups of people
(committees, for example) often make decisions which, as individuals, they
would consider to be silly . . . .'
There didn't seem much wrong with that, apart from 'silly' being a poor
substitute for the original formula's 'stupid'. So I skipped on through the
glossary to the letter M. Whereupon the canines finally bit home.
There before my eyes was the heading 'Macaulay's Transfer', followed by: 'A
rule first stated by the historian Lord Macaulay'. Which set me wondering
why the said lord was hogging the credit when all he did was explain why the
old East India Company's on-the-spot executives, such as Clive, took such
effective initiatives.
Admittedly some of what they did was also reprehensible and would never have
been approved by the board. But as Macaulay points out, if they had
consulted their London-based directors, there wouldn't have been any
effective action, because 'the average interval between the sending of a
despatch and the receipt of an answer was above a year and a half '. There,
however, the historian bows out of the act.
The credit for first stating the rule based on his words - which reads:
Initiative declines with increasing ease of communications - belongs to the
Financial Times Jobs column. Indeed, like the Abilene Paradox, Macaulay's
Transfer (alternatively entitled the 'Buck-shifter') is one of the Laws of
Organisational Stupidity of which, for a decade now, I've been the official
codifier. Nor are those two the only examples of the current 23 which the
booklet has annexed.
It's all my own fault, of course, for letting senile caution prevail over
readers' requests. Every time I have introduced a new law - the last
occasion was 14 months ago - numerous of you have got in touch asking me to
set out the entire lot. But I've been chary of doing so.
For one thing, yet another maxim of my trade holds that repeating material
at too frequent intervals is akin to selling wet coke, and I printed the
full code as it then existed as recently as autumn 1986. For another, as
long as there was something else to write about, I felt it wiser to save the
laws for a rainy day.
Still, as the weather-proofing has not saved me from being nibbled, I'd
better change my ways. The trouble is that even if I hadn't already wittered
on for half the room available, the full laws just couldn't be stated in a
single column. So I shall have to offer them chunk by chunk, spaced over the
next few weeks.
A further snag is that those of you who're familiar with the code will need
to shut your eyes for a spell while, for the benefit of any less enduring
readers present, I reiterate two basic points about the laws' status.
The first is that they are not all of my own formulation. Some have been
taken ready-made from famous authors, albeit with due acknowledgement, such
as C. Northcote Parkinson's first law: Work expands to fill the time
available. Still more of them were originated by various of you out there,
my role being merely to tidy up the wording. An example is Mangham's
Muffler, mis-named 'Maugham's' by the book, which was inspired by Bath
University's Professor of Management Iain Mangham, and pronounces: When
communicating to superiors, new news is bad news.
The second point is that the laws are not of the inviolable kind exemplified
by the law of gravity. Not only can they be broken, but when they are, the
result is beneficial. What they define are simply regularities: events that
occur continually in organisations of all kinds the whole world over.
Accordingly, the laws' nearest parallel in established theory is economics.
Indeed, an acid test of whether a proposed rule is fit to enter the canon,
is whether it looks to be at least as reliable in predicting what actually
happens as the laws of economics.
There is nevertheless one key difference. Top executives believe in
economics and study same on MBA courses and the like. The stupidity
parallels are not studied on high, but just left to be suffered by those
below.
Hence, despite the teeth-marks, the Jobs column feels a touch grateful to
the aforesaid Tim Hindle. After all, by putting some of the stupidity laws
in a book with 'MBA' in its title, he has given the code what seems to be
its first chance of being seriously studied where it counts.
Even so, I do wish he'd got them right. For his presentation sometimes
serves to obscure the real cause of the daft dynamics the laws describe  -
which for those cited so far lies in power politics. Professor Parkinson saw
the push to win power by amassing subordinates as underpinning his first
law, although in the other instances the root is not so much the acquisition
of power as top managers' yen for wielding it relentlessly over others.
But that is hardly recognised by Mr Hindle's explanation for the Abilene
Paradox, which goes: 'The group agrees to do a silly thing because each
individual knows he or she can sidestep responsibility for the action of the
group.' The reason offered by the originator Jerry Harvey was different. He
attributed the lemming-like urge to go with the mob to the separate
individuals' fear that dissent would lead them to be branded not-one-of-us,
and have the skids put under them.
The same often justified fear that outstanding deeds are more likely to
bring punishments than rewards is also at the root of the two other laws
I've quoted. Given the popularity of the phrase 'shoot the messenger',
Mangham's Muffler needs no explanation. Nor does the decline of on-the-spot
initiative when the risk of retribution can be minimised by swiftly passing
the buck to power-loving bosses.
Moreover the wisdom of safety play gives rise to a further law, Marshall's
Metamorphosis. It was inspired by a certain educational inspector's comments
on how futile it is for governments and other authorities which lay down
rules to expect them to be followed broadly in the spirit instead of
narrowly to the letter. It reads: Guidelines from superiors are
straitjackets to subordinates.

FT  10 MAR 93 / BES sponsors reject attack from Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPONSORS of the Business Expan-sion Scheme defended it yesterday after Mr
Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, called for a 'misuse' of the scheme,
which has already raised Pounds 266m, to be abolished in the Budget. He said
on Monday that a scheme using loans to BES investors turned 'the misery of
the repossessed homeless into a tax-avoidance opportunity'.
Investments in BES companies, which buy property and let it under
assured-tenancy provisions for at least five years, are eligible for income
tax relief at the investor's top marginal rate. Mr Brown complained about a
legislative loophole, first exploited last September, which allows loans to
be made to BES investors using only the value of their BES shares as
security. These loans have made it possible for top-rate taxpayers to pay
only basic rate tax and to leave their investment after six months rather
than the five years originally intended.
Large lenders have avoided bad-debt write-offs by transferring their
repossessed housing stock to BES companies. Lenders which have taken
advantage of the scheme include Barclays Bank, TSB, Bank of Scotland, Bank
of Ireland, Hill Samuel, and Bradford &amp; Bingley, Bristol &amp; West, Britannia,
Leeds Permanent, National &amp; Provincial, and Portman building societies.
A total of Pounds 266m has been raised via loan-backed schemes since they
were introduced last September, and between Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m is
available for investment. The potential cost to the Treasury could exceed
Pounds 200m for this tax year alone.
Mr Ian Pugh, a BES analyst with the Allenbridge Group, one of the two main
intermediaries dealing with BES investors, describes the loan-backed schemes
as 'pure arbitrage'. Shares are sold for Pounds 1 and after six months loans
are offered, typically of 74p or 75p per Pounds 1 invested.
For top-rate taxpayers, who should have received 40p tax relief for each
Pounds 1, this means an annualised return of about 25 per cent.
The loans are repaid by the BES shares once the normal five-year qualifying
period has elapsed. Meanwhile the lenders have received very cheap finance.
The schemes have attracted heavy demand. Mr Charles Fry, chairman of Johnson
Fry, which launched the first non-recourse loan scheme in conjunction with
TSB Mortgage Express, said: 'It's good for people whose houses have been
repossessed because the property is sold for the higher of two independent
valuations.'
He said the schemes were good value for the government compared with the
alternative of direct subsidies. Only Pounds 250m of the Pounds 750m
allocated by the government to housing associations last autumn to buy
housing had been used to buy repossessions, with about 5,000 properties
being bought.
Mr Fry's views were echoed by Mr Tim Villiers, chairman of the BES
Association. 'The figures are straightforward,' he said. 'Ten thousand
properties (Pounds 500m) through BES, with private investors contributing,
costs the government Pounds 200m in tax relief at 40 per cent. Five thousand
houses as a direct grant cost Pounds 250m. Which method is more efficient at
helping to get liquidity, and hence confidence, into the housing market?'

FT  10 MAR 93 / Pips . . .but very few great expectations: Savers may find
the chancellor has spending on his mind. Philip Coggan reads the signals -
Spring Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVERS might not expect the chancellor to offer them many incentives when he
unveils his Budget next week. With the economy at best showing tentative
signs of recovery the government naturally wants consumers to spend, not
save, their money.
But there is one area where there might be a tax carrot for savers. The
budget deficit is widely expected to reach Pounds 50bn in 1993-94, requiring
the government to sell substantial amounts of gilt-edged stock. Encouraging
private investors to buy these gilts might take the pressure off the
principal buyers, the investment institutions.
One much-touted theory is that personal equity plans, which allow investors
to accumulate gains and dividends from shares tax-free, might be expanded to
include gilts (and be renamed personal investment plans or Pips).
With net returns from building societies now about 3 per cent to 4 per cent,
private investors might be lured into buying gilts on tax-free yields of 8
per cent.
Mr Jeremy Hancock of Price Waterhouse says the creation of Pips would cost
the government very little. The pension funds and institutions which would
otherwise have bought the securities pay very little tax on their gilt
income.
But what then of the savings/spending question? Mr Robert Barrie, an
economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, thinks the chancellor is more likely to
encourage the corporate sector, than the personal sector, to spend. 'Big tax
changes would be received very badly,' says Mr Barrie, 'so the best thing
for the chancellor to do is very little.'
Some believe, however, that the chancellor will act against personal savers.
Accountants Ernst &amp; Young have suggested that the government might abolish
Tessas (Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account), which allow savers to
accumulate interest on deposits tax-free.
But it was Mr John Major who introduced the Tessa in 1990 when he was
chancellor (as part of a 'Budget for savers'). According to Mr Paul Johnson
of the Institute for Fiscal Studies 'anything as radical as abolishing
Tessas would be a major reversal of policy.' His alternative proposal is
that Mr Lamont could remove the requirement that money be left in Tessas for
five years to qualify for tax-free status. He says this might release a lot
of funds into the economy immediately - according to the Inland Revenue
about Pounds 11.5bn was in Tessa deposits at the end of June.
One loophole that could go is the Business Expansion Scheme. The BES is due
to be abolished at the end of the year. Financial groups have been so canny
at exploiting the rules that money is flooding into schemes before the
deadlines. Some estimate that Pounds 1bn could be raised through the BES
this year, costing the Exchequer about Pounds 400m in tax relief.
The chancellor could reduce the problem by stopping the so-called
loan-backed schemes which allow investors to get tax-free returns of 20 per
cent plus within six months.
If the chancellor really wants to attack savings habits then he might look
at the life assurance and pensions industries which, as the table shows,
have taken half of savings inflows in recent years.
There are difficulties in penalising existing plan holders. It is a
long-standing tradition that tax changes should not apply retrospectively,
and encouraging savers to withdraw from long-term commitments might lead
them to pay penalties.
Nevertheless, there are measures which could be taken. The government could
abolish higher-rate tax relief on pension contributions. In the wake of the
similar change to mortgage tax relief in 1991 this would be a step towards
'fiscal neutrality' (the removal of tax distortions) which the government
has in the past expressed as an aim.
Mr Johnson says this move would surprise him, since it would not raise a lot
of money. Mr Johnson suggests that instead the chancellor might tax the lump
sum which investors receive when they cash in their pension. It could be
argued that this is one perk too many since pension fund contributions are
already free of tax and the fund accumulates tax-free.
The risk for Mr Lamont is that such technical changes might not discourage
saving, simply redirect it.
It might seem that the easiest way for the chancellor to discourage saving
is to cut interest rates again. But the savings ratio (personal savings as a
percentage of income, minus income tax, social security contributions and
other financial transfers) reached 12.3 per cent in the third quarter of
last year - its highest level since 1984. This was in spite of the cuts in
the level of interest rates from 15 per cent to 10 per cent between 1990 and
1992.
It could be that people are saving to build up a cash cushion in case they
become unemployed, or to pay off previous debts. If that is the case it is
the macro measures which the chancellor takes to stimulate the economy, not
actions against small parts of the financial services industry, which will
do most to change savings patterns.
The savings industry will be hoping he thinks so.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Devaluation effect seen in prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURERS may be increasing prices in reaction to the higher costs
sparked by sterling's devaluation, government figures indicated yesterday.
They proovided a warning of strong inflationary pressures.
There was a big rise last month in the prices of materials and food
purchased by manufacturers. This was accompanied by indications that
companies were passing on more of these costs to UK customers, possibly in
an effort to rebuild profit margins on hopes of a recovery.
Factory-gate prices last month of manufactured goods excluding food, drink
and tobacco - prices of which fluctuate due to tax changes - rose 2.7 per
cent compared with February last year.
That is the same year-on-year rate as in January and above the 2.4 per cent
year on year increase recorded for each of the last two months of last year.
The prices of materials and fuel purchased by manufacturers rose 0.5 per
cent in February compared with the previous month, the same rise as between
December last year and January. The rises are partly a result of the higher
import prices that resulted from the 15 per cent fall in sterling since last
September, when Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism.
The year-on-year increase in materials and fuel prices last month was 6.9
per cent, unadjusted for seasonal variations. This is up from a revised
increase of 6.3 per cent in the year to January and is the highest
year-on-year rise since May 1989.
The figures from the Central Statistical Office support theories that
inflation, as measured by wholesale prices of factory goods, may start to
climb later this year in response to higher import costs.
More positive news on inflation for many companies is that labour costs are
rising slowly. Many workers have agreed low wage settlements, due partly to
continuing recessionary conditions and fears about unemployment.
Prices at the factory gate of manufactured goods for UK sale, including
food, drink and tobacco, increased by 3.7 per cent in February compared with
the previous February - up from a year-on-year 3.6 per cent in January and
the highest yearly rise since last April.
Between September and February prices paid by manufacturers for materials
and fuel increased by 9.2 per cent. The increases have particularly affected
companies in the metals, food and chemicals businesses which import large
amounts of raw materials.
Allowing for seasonal variations, prices of materials and fuel rose 1.4 per
cent in February compared with January.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Birt challenged on assistant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT, the BBC director-general, was challenged in public last night
to name the secretarial assistant for whom he claimed Pounds 15,000 expenses
in the 1991 tax returns of his private company John Birt Productions. Mr
Birt did not give a direct answer.
The challenge came from Mr Jeremy Isaacs, general director of the Royal
Opera House and former chief executive of Channel 4, in an interview with Mr
Birt on the stage of the National Film Theatre - an interview that was
designed as a curtain-raiser to a two-day conference on the future of the
corporation.
'It seems to me I did satisfy the concern that this arrangement (having his
BBC salary paid through a private company) had been a way of me enjoying a
significant tax advantage,' Mr Birt said. 'It is not right that I have to
reveal every detail of my personal matters. I don't intend to.'
On Monday Mr Birt issued a statement regretting the distress caused by the
fact he had never been on the staff of the BBC while he held the post of
deputy director-general.
Accountants Ernst and Young examined the accounts of Mr Birt's company and
found that in 1991 the overall tax saving generated by being paid through
the company was Pounds 3,935 - Pounds 810 when such items as accountancy
charges were deducted.
Earlier the director-general said that he regretted the decision to stay a
freelance.
' I came (to the BBC) from another world and that arrangement seemed
sensible to me,' Mr Birt said.
Mr Birt conceded that the affair had damaged his relationship with BBC staff
but he hoped they now would be able to go forward together.
Mr Isaacs also asked Mr Birt about about Producer Choice, the system which
gives producers the right to buy services from the outside market.
Mr Birt said he would be 'very surprised' if 50 per cent of BBC production
was bought from outside the corporation. It would mean that something was
wrong with the price or quality of BBC services and Mr Birt did not believe
this was the case.
The director general said he wanted to create an institution that was no
longer a monolith and in which there was maximum autonomy and creativity.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Fish row protests stepped up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERMEN IN Grimsby yesterday prevented French fish from being unloaded for
the second day running in the latest stage of a growing European Community
dispute over cheap imports.
Police were investigating a separate incident on Monday night in which
trawlermen at Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, poured diesel oil into the hold of a
Russian factory ship.
The actions in the UK coincided with further protests by French fishermen
against cheap fish imports following a violent clash between fishermen and
riot police outside the fish market in Nantes.
The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, representing most
fishermen in England and Wales, said UK fishermen were frustrated by what
they perceived as their disadvantaged financial situation in the face of
government restrictions, a flood of cheap imports from Russia and Norway,
and an increase in fish landed by EC boats.
Mr Barry Deas, federation secretary, said: 'We are operating against weak
demand. What we really need are tight controls on the amount of fish coming
in.'
Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, accused fishermen of simplifying the
problem and warned that protest action would undermine the government's
attempts to argue its case in the EC.

A TOUGH regulatory regime would be essential to ensure that a European
postal service was not exploited by monopoly operators, the Consumers'
Association said yesterday.
A European Community green paper on developing a single market for postal
services has suggested the gradual liberalisation of cross-border and direct
mail services in Europe.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Reform to axe Arts Council
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Arts Council of Great Britain is to disappear as a result of the
government's reform proposals for Scotland.
In future the funding of the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils will be the
direct responsibility of the respective secretaries of state. At the moment
they receive their annual grants through the ACGB according to an agreed
formula linked to their populations.
The Arts Council of Great Britain will become an Arts Council for England.
The change will enable arts organisations in Scotland and Wales to lobby
hard for extra cash in Edinburgh and Cardiff.

THE MINISTRY of Defence is putting pressure on the Department of Trade and
Industry to try to ensure Leyland Daf is able to complete a key contract to
make military trucks.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, yesterday confirmed that a
senior MOD official had written to the DTI to argue that the taxpayer's
interest would best be served if the order was completed by the company,
which collapsed into administrative receivership last month.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Vauxhall defends price structure
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES of new cars in the UK are now lower than in several other European
countries, according to a report published yesterday by Vauxhall, the UK
subsidiary of General Motors of the US, says, Kevin Done writes.
Vauxhall has published the study, prepared by management consultants AT
Kearney, in an effort to avoid action by the government to force carmakers
to change some of the controversial terms of their franchise agreements with
dealers.
The motor industry's selective distribution system, which allows carmakers
to sell vehicles through exclusive networks, has been blamed by consumer
groups for making UK car prices higher than in many other parts of Europe.
The investigation of car makers' pricing policies across Europe is set to
intensify in the next two years, as the present 10-year 'block exemption',
which allows car makers to use a selective dealer distribution system in
contravention of European Community competition rules, is due to expire in
mid-1995.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Top civil servants should be accountable, MPs told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOP civil servants should be put on five-year contracts and be accountable
for their performance in policy-making, according to Mr Graham Mather,
president of the European Policy Forum, the free-market think tank.
Mr Mather says in a submission to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service
committee that senior mandarins cannot escape blame for 'systematic policy
failure under governments of different colours'.
He says these failures have included stop-go economic policies,
underperforming state education and the recent fiasco over the pit closures.
According to Mr Mather sterling's departure from the exchange rate
mechanism, the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International and the
events surrounding the supply of arms to Iraq revealed by the
Matrix-Churchill trial have all raised issues about the conduct of civil
servants and the responsibilities of ministers. He says that if Whitehall's
560 top policy-making civil servants were on five-year contracts, paid at
market rates, it would be easier to hold them to account.
The recommendation would apply to permanent secretaries, deputy secretaries
and under secretaries, all of whom are responsible for policy-making.
Mr Mather says that if the initiative was combined with a requirement to
advertise the posts, it would also make a period of working in the Civil
Service more attractive to successful executives from the private sector.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Business start-ups increase by 19%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP increase in the number of business start-ups in the last three
months of last year may indicate that the worst of the recession is over, a
survey by Barclays Bank says.
The bank's small business bulletin reported that 125,000 businesses were
launched in the last quarter of last year - an increase of 19 per cent on
the same period of 1991. The increase was due in part to cuts in bank base
rates and rising levels of unemployment, the bulletin said.
In the whole of last year, however, new business starts fell to 455,000 from
484,000 the year before. Business closures continued to outnumber new starts
with 570,000 businesses ceasing to trade. This was 17,000 fewer than the
closures in 1991.
Overall, the stock of small businesses fell 4 per cent to 2.77m although
there were still more businesses registered than at any time before
1987-1989.
The failure of many very small and young businesses has led to a change in
the profile of the average business. The proportion of older, larger
businesses is on the increase. Businesses with an annual turnover of more
than Pounds 100,000 rose by 60,000 (5 per cent) between 1990 and 1992.
Nearly 13 per cent of all starts were in the manufacturing sector last year,
compared with 9 per cent in 1991, the bulletin reported.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Judge will view arms documents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LORD Chief Justice, Lord Taylor, is to examine confidential government
papers about defence exports to the Middle East.
The move comes after it was revealed that a businessman convicted of
conspiring to ship artillery fuses illegally to Iraq had also worked for
Britain's security and intelligence services.
Mr John Grecian, a former managing director of Ordinance Technology (known
as Ordtech), a Reading-based engineering company, pleaded guilty in February
last year to conspiring to breach controls on the exporting of military
equipment to Iraq. He received a one-year suspended sentence.
Yesterday Mr Grecian's counsel, Mr Peter Clarke, told Lord Taylor and two
other Appeal Court judges that Mr Grecian had supplied information to both
MI5 and MI6 in the late 1980s. The information was passed to the Foreign
Office and discussed with King Hussein of Jordan, he said.
Mr Grecian and three other men pleaded guilty to conspiring to evade export
controls after their trial judge accepted the government's arguments that
sensitive information about trading with Iraq should not be put before a
jury.
They are now seeking leave to appeal against their convictions in the wake
of last year's Matrix Churchill trial, when ministers' use of public
interest immunity certificates to suppress sensitive information was
successfully challenged.
The three other men are Mr Brian Mason, Ordtech's former engineering
director, Mr William Blackledge of Preston, Lancashire, and Mr Colin
Phillips of Poole, Dorset.
At their trial prosecutors alleged that the four men were part of a
conspiracy to use bogus end-user certificates to evade the ban on arms
exports to Iraq and supply fuses for 155m heavy artillery shells.
The fuses were never exported, but the certificates stated they were
destined for Jordan, the trial judge was told. The four maintained that the
British authorities had been aware of their activities.
Yesterday's preliminary hearing - to decide whether the four men should be
allowed leave to appeal - was adjourned to allow Customs' prosecutors time
to decide which documents could be handed over to defence lawyers and which
should be left for the Lord Chief Justice to decide on their disclosure.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Vauxhall fights franchise moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES of new cars in the UK are now lower than in several other European
countries, a report published yesterday by Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of
General Motors of the US, says.
Vauxhall has issued the study, prepared by management consultants AT
Kearney, in an effort to avoid action by the government to force carmakers
to change some of the controversial terms of their franchise agreements with
dealers.
The motor industry's selective distribution system, which allows carmakers
to sell vehicles through exclusive networks, has been blamed by consumer
groups for making UK car prices higher than in many other parts of Europe.
The investigation of car makers' pricing policies across Europe is set to
intensify in the next two years, as the present 10-year 'block exemption',
which allows car makers to use a selective dealer distribution system in
contravention of European Community competition rules, is due to expire in
mid-1995.
It is understood that carmakers in the UK have rebuffed a request made last
year by the Office of Fair Trading to change some of the more restrictive
terms of their dealer franchise agreements.
The changes were recommended in a report published early last year by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission after an investigation into UK car prices.
It is understood that the OFT has recommended that the DTI will have to take
action to force implementation of the MMC report's findings.
The MMC report recommended the removal of any restrictions on franchised
dealers which:
Limit the dealers' freedom to advertise outside their territory.
Limit dealers' freedom to hold or acquire dealerships from other car makers
outside their territory.
Prevent dealers holding or acquiring competing dealerships in their
territory (although the supplier may require that any other dealership
acquired be on a distinct and separate site and a reasonable distance away).
Restrict the extent to which dealers can sell car-related goods or services,
such as hire, second-hand car sales, fast-fit or multi-brand servicing
outside their territory.
Limit the number of the manufacturer's cars that any dealer or dealer group
may sell in any given period, or the proportion of the total sales of its
cars that may be made by any dealer or dealer group.
Vauxhall, which ranks second in the UK new-car market, yesterday urged other
carmakers to prepare a new action plan to establish 'common ground' with the
OFT, which could allow changes in franchise agreements that would be
'compatible' with present EC regulations.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Fish row protests stepped up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERMEN IN Grimsby yesterday prevented French fish from being unloaded for
the second day running in the latest stage of a growing European Community
dispute over cheap imports.
Police were yesterday investigating a separate incident on Monday night in
which trawlermen at Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, poured diesel oil into the
hold of a Russian factory ship.
The actions in the UK coincided with further protests by French fishermen
against cheap fish imports following a violent clash between fishermen and
riot police outside the fish market in Nantes.
The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, representing most
fishermen in England and Wales, said UK fishermen were frustrated by what
they perceived as their disadvantaged financial situation in the face of
government restrictions, a flood of cheap imports from Russia and Norway,
and an increase in fish landed by EC boats.
Mr Barry Deas, federation secretary, said: 'We are operating against weak
demand. What we really need are tight quantitive controls on the amount of
fish coming in.'
Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, accused fishermen of simplifying the
problem besetting the industry, and inadequately regulating themselves. He
warned that protest action would undermine the government's attempts to
argue its case within the EC.
Mr Curry said: 'It may be that imports are playing some role in the problems
of the market place at the moment. But that is not the only factor. British
fishermen are landing too much fish simultaneously. They are oversupplying
the market.'
The minister described the protest actions in Grimsby and Peterhead as
'totally silly' when UK ministers were urging their French counterparts to
take measures to protect British lorries.
The complex issues besetting the fishing industry were highlighted last
night by Mr Philip Greig, managing director of Abacus Frozen Foods, the
importer of the Russian fish destroyed by Monday night's action in
Peterhead.
Mr Greig said Russian cod was being imported in exchange for locally fished
haddock and whiting. He warned that further protest action would force the
closure of his factory and have a knock-on effect on local fishermen.
Mr Ron Gillan, chief executive of the Scottish North East Fish Producers'
Organisation, said he could not rule out the possibility of protest action
spreading among British ports.

FT  10 MAR 93 / British Coal to spend Pounds 7m at threatened pit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is to invest Pounds 7m immediately in Wearmouth colliery, one
of 31 collieries threatened with closure.
The investment raises hopes among the pit's 800 miners that their jobs will
be saved.
Wearmouth was one of four pits earmarked for mothballing in October's
closure announcement.
Some of the Pounds 7m would be retrievable - and transferred to other mines
 -if the pit closed. But it is unlikely British Coal would have made the
investment unless there was a strong chance of Wearmouth surviving.
A white paper is likely to provide measures which will enable at least 10 of
the 31 pits to remain open. British Coal yesterday said that last week
Wearmouth pushed up output per man per shift to 7.45 tonnes, the first time
any pit in north east England has exceeded 7 tonnes.
The Pounds 7m investment will allow British Coal to reap further benefit
from Pounds 17.5m invested over the last three years at the Sunderland
colliery to access coal reserves 2-metres thick.
Wearmouth, which has access to up to an estimated 200m tonnes of coal
reserves under the North Sea has lost about Pounds 15m this year, as
substantial resources have been devoted to development work.
The colliery was still not in profit last week because of its heavy
investment programme, but its prospects look brighter thanks to access to
the new seams, replacing thinner faces 1-metre thick. The Pounds 7m will be
spent between this week and the end of May on powered roof supports and
other heavy duty equipment.
British Coal declined to speculate on whether yesterday's investment
announcement meant Wearmouth had a secure future, either under British Coal
or as a privatised operation.
British Coal believes the pit deputies' union Nacods has failed to secure
the 66 per cent vote it needs under its constitution for strike action from
its 5,000 members in a secret ballot.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Electronic newspaper for the blind is launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST electronic newspaper of its kind in Europe for the blind and
visually impaired was launched yesterday by the Royal National Institute for
the Blind and The Guardian.
The entire text of each copy of The Guardian will be broadcast by teletext
in the middle of the night and stored in a personal computer. With the help
of a voice synthesiser a blind person can browse through the headlines and
articles in the way that a sighted person flicks through a newspaper.
Mr Ian Wright, managing editor of The Guardian, said: 'This is the first
time a newspaper has travelled into people's homes other than through the
letterbox.'
He believes that one day it will be the way that all newspapers are
delivered.
The service is being provided as a commercial enterprise by Electronic Text
Network Associates of Newcastle upon Tyne, a joint-venture company that
includes the RNIB, The Guardian and two technology companies, Aptech and
Intelligent Research.
The entire text of an issue of The Guardian can be broadcast to a PC in 20
minutes and is available by 6am.
The RNIB wants other newspapers to join the service so that the UK's 1m
blind or visually impaired people have a choice of daily newspapers.
Mr Brian Payne, the blind chairman of Electronic Aids For the Blind, said:
'I think it is absolutely marvellous to be able to read a daily newspaper in
the same way that everyone else can.'
A basic system, including a year's subscription to The Guardian, costs
Pounds 560, but that does not include the personal computer or the voice
synthesiser. Apart from purchases by individuals, the RNIB hopes the system
will become increasingly available in libraries, colleges and workplaces.
Although the system has been designed primarily for the visually impaired -
apart from the voice synthesiser the text can be displayed on screen in very
large letters - it could have wider implications.
When a wider selection of newspapers become available, electronic newspapers
for the blind could become a relatively inexpensive data base for everyone
else.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Rolls-Royce set to shed 3,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE, the aero-engine and industrial power group, is likely to shed
between 3,000 and 5,000 jobs this year in the face of continuing recession
in the industry.
The company is expected to announce the cuts tomorrow when it reports its
financial results for last year.
The expected job cuts follow sweeping restructuring during the last two
years which has seen the loss of about 12,000 jobs throughout the group.
Rolls-Royce employed 64,200 people at the end of 1990 - 36,500 in aerospace
 -and about 52,000 at the end of last year, with aerospace accounting for
just under 30,000.
Most of the latest cuts are likely to be concentrated in aerospace, which
accounts for about 60 per cent of the group's Pounds 3.5bn annual turnover.
The company, like its two principal US competitors, General Electric and
Pratt &amp; Whitney, has suffered from the combined effects of the decline in
defence spending and the sharp recession in the civil aviation industry.
Rolls-Royce has faced heavy research and development costs for the Trent,
the engine which will power the new generation of widebodied aircraft.
The job cuts are also part of the company's continuing efforts to improve
efficiency and competitiveness. Rolls-Royce is also continuing to
rationalise its manufacturing, and has announced plans to shut its
helicopter-engine plant at Leavesden, Hertfordshire, and a components
factory at Parkside, Coventry.
Analysts expect Rolls-Royce to report 1992 pre-tax profits of Pounds 50m to
Pounds 90m tomorrow, compared with Pounds 51m in 1991, and to cut its
dividend.

FT  10 MAR 93 / NatWest admits Visa bills errors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank yesterday admitted that thousands of payments on
its Visa credit cards had been switched among accounts. It said it was not
sure if it would be able to identify the errors unless each customer
complained.
The bank said it believed 'human error' was to blame for the application of
payments to the wrong accounts which had taken place in January. It was
correcting errors as customers complained about their accounts.
The mix-up follows mistakes over payments on credit cards from NatWest and
other banks in August. These occurred when First Data Resources, which
processes transactions on several banks' behalf, changed computer software.
National Westminster said it had not yet identified where the error had
taken place. Cheques to pay accounts are sent to its London cheque clearing
centre before information is passed on to First Data Resources for
processing.
The bank said the number of errors was in the 'low thousands'. They came to
light after complaints from customers who had received statements containing
wrongly applied payments.
NatWest said it was still investigating what had occurred.
Ms Jean Eaglesham, head of money policy at the Consumers' Association, said
the error showed that banks were failing to vet statements and relying on
customer complaints.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Lords to rule on card fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOUSE of Lords is to be asked to rule on a legal test case over whether
Barclays Bank should have to honour cheques with forged signatures backed by
stolen cheque guarantee cards.
Appeal Court judges said in a 2-1 ruling yesterday that Barclays should be
liable to honour cheques when supported by old bank guarantee cards.
The cards, which are no longer in use, have the terms of the guarantee
printed on them, specifically excluding fraudulent payments.
The judges gave Barclays leave to appeal to the House of Lords after lawyers
for the bank said the ruling could cost it 'several tens of millions of
pounds' if similar cases came to court.
The Master of the Rolls, Sir Thomas Bingham, said he had considerable
hesitation in rejecting the bank's argument that it should not have to
honour such fraudulent payments.
However, he said, the bank's claim about future possible losses might be
exaggerated.
The cards were phased out from January 1990 when Barclays' guarantee came
into line with that offered by other high street banks.
This leaves it to banks' discretion whether to honour such cheques - the
deciding factor being whether the signature is a good enough forgery for
retailers not to be reasonably expected to spot the fraud.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Yorkshire Electricity offers biggest price cuts this year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Electricity yesterday offered the biggest price cut of any
regional power company this year - its domestic bills are to fall by more
than 3.5 per cent from April.
The company said small industrial and commercial customers would see a
reduction in their bills of about 5 per cent. The announcement was welcomed
by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, who indicated
that other regional electricity companies should consider similar
reductions.
Yorkshire's decision follows announcements of price freezes at other
companies, including Seeboard and Eastern Electricity, and a 1 per cent
reduction at South Wales Electricity. Prof Littlechild said domestic
electricity prices should fall because of reductions in the price of UK
coal, a cut in the fossil fuel levy from 11 per cent of bills to 10 per
cent, and a reduction in transmission charges.
Yorkshire said it was the first cut in electricity bills for domestic
customers since 1986.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Generators told to sell plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK electricity regulator yesterday suggested to National Power and
PowerGen, the main generators in England and Wales, that they offer for sale
11 power stations that they plan to close either fully or partly later this
month.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the regulator, said putting them on the
market would provide 'the best safeguard against the possibility or
suspicion of monopoly exploitation.' It would also provide protection
against a big generator closing economic plant with a view to driving up the
price of electricity and, thus, the profitability of other plant.
National Power, the larger of the two companies, strongly rejected Prof
Littlechild's suggestion. It said overcapacity in generation was increasing
and that retaining redundant plant would lead to the closure of more modern
and efficient plant. Electricity production costs would rise and the
environment would suffer.
PowerGen said it did not rule out selling one of its four plants. City
analysts said, however, it was unlikely that either company wanted to sell
their plants.
National Power's robust defence of its actions risks antagonising the
regulator, who has already said he is considering referring the generators
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and will decide by 1995.
Analysts believe it unlikely he will make a reference. They think he will
seek a change in their licence which would give him powers to order them to
sell plants.
National Power's stance is a blow to such companies as Cabah Energy, which
wants to buy surplus plant.
Mr Chris Rowland, a director of Cabah Energy, said yesterday his company was
interested in buying plant at five National Power-owned coal-fired stations
with a 1,200MW generating capacity. He said: 'If we acquired all five we
would be using 2.5m tonnes of coal a year.' That constitutes the production
of up to two of the 31 threatened pits.
Prof Littlechild's recommendation followed publication of a report by Touche
Ross, accountants who he had appointed to be inde-pendent assessors on the
closures.
He endorsed their findings that while both companies' decisions to close
plant were reasonable, there were several 'credible organisations'
interested in purchasing stations.
He also said the generators should even consider selling plant they
considered viable. This would provide greater opportunity for
diversification than the present industry structure allowed.
National Power said it would consider on their merit any bids for plant not
scheduled for closure.
The 11 stations scheduled for closure have a total 2,263MW capacity, of
which 1,737MW is from coal-fired plant.

THE INSTITUTE of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales has launched a
strong attack on the proposals on the future development of auditing issued
by the Auditing Practices Board late last year.
In response to the board's consultative document it expresses disappointment
that the board failed to provide more detailed evidence or to draw firm
conclusions.
It says the primary focus of auditors must always be on the historical
accounts, not on future prospects and 'categorically opposes' proposals for
two-tier standards, giving different requirements for public interest
companies.

FT  10 MAR 93 / South-east in rail cuts frontline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL'S Network SouthEast commuter operations are to bear the brunt
of service cuts when the new national rail timetable comes into operation in
May, it emerged yesterday.
Mr Brian Wilson, opposition transport spokesman, said the government's plans
for rail privatisation were to blame for the cuts. He said BR was being
forced to create a railway slim enough for the private sector to inherit.
Network SouthEast said its commuter traffic had declined by 7 per cent a
year for the least two years and was expected to go on doing so next year.
Examples of cuts include the loss of six return journeys a day on Sussex
coast services and eight return journeys a day on the south London lines.
There will be peak-hour reductions on the Kent Link, Hastings, Sheerness and
Medway Valley lines.
BR's InterCity division is also making cuts. Hull will lose one of the two
direct trains which link it with London each weekday and the daily return
train between Liverpool and Dover is to be axed. The 15-minute interval
Gatwick Express service will be reduced to 30-minute intervals early in the
morning.
In contrast, Regional Railways, BR's provincial passenger operation, is
increasing services. It will be opening a link to Manchester airport in May
and plans a service between Birmingham Snow Hill and London Marylebone via
Leamington Spa.
British Rail's Trainload Freight division, recently criticised for pricing
freight off the rails, yesterday said it had won a waste-disposal contract
in Manchester that would take 10,000 lorries a year off the roads.

FT  10 MAR 93 / CBI urges labour reviews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry said yesterday that more companies
should consider withdrawing from collective bargaining, David Goodhart
writes.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, CBI director of employment affairs, recommends in a paper
on pay setting that companies consider increasing the proportion of
employees on short-term and fixed contracts and locking labour costs into
pay deals of more than one year.
He also says companies should consider withdrawing recognition from trade
unions. After a discussion of single union deals, which he says might soon
be on the increase, Mr Gilbert states: 'But for many (companies), no union
at all may now make more sense'.
The paper says managers are generally unwilling to organise work as they
wish, even though recent surveys have shown that two thirds believe they are
free to do so.

A DECISION on which of the two competing British dockyards, Rosyth or

Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, also told MPs he was

of obtaining Trident strategic missiles for the submarines as a result of US

Information Council, an independent lobby group, that the extra cost of
Trident missiles remaining to be paid for by the UK could be more than
Pounds 200m.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Peers fight off leasehold rebellion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORT from opposition parties yesterday enabled the government to fight
off an extensive rebellion from its own backbenchers in the House of Lords
over leasehold reform, Alison Smith writes.
Labour and Liberal Democrat peers joined ministers and Tory loyalists in
voting down amendments which would have restricted the government's plans to
give long leaseholders in blocks of flats the right to club together to buy
the freehold of the property.
A stream of Tory peers, led by Lord Boardman and Lord Peyton - both former
ministers - urged ministers to confine the new rights to leaseholders who
were resident in the flats and who were UK nationals.
Although the rebels attracted the support of Lord Tebbit, a former Tory
party chairman, peers rejected their proposals.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister to press France over
electricity exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN IS to explore the possibility of using the French interconnector to
export electricity supplies to Spain and Italy, Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade and industry secretary, told MPs last night.
He said this would be among the matters discussed by Mr Tim Eggar, the
energy minister, in talks with the French government in Paris today.
Underlining the difficulties in securing an expanded market for deep-mined
coal, Mr Heseltine rejected some of the key proposals made by the Commons
trade and industry committee designed to limit the pit closures originally
proposed by the government.
He ruled out government action to drastically curtail electricity supplied
from France via the French interconnector, saying it would be contrary to
the Treaty of Rome which established the EC.
'The proposal put forward by the select committee to reduce the amount of
electricity coming across the interconnector from the present 6.5m tonnes of
coal equivalent to zero or anywhere near this is not an option,' he said.
Acknowledging that many MPs had been attracted by the idea of ending
electricity imports from France, he stressed that adopting such a course
would have put the government at 'considerable financial risk' in relation
to indemnities given to the privatised electricity companies.
Mr Heseltine also warned that the select committee's recommendation calling
for the removal of Electricite de France's non-leviable status might well
have the effect of it being allowed access to the same premium prices
available to Nuclear Electric financed through the levy.
Mr Heseltine cast doubt on the practicality of the committee's conclusion
that it ought to be possible to find a market for an additional 16m tonnes
or more of deep-mined coal in each of the next five years. He disputed the
committee's estimate that a subsidy costing Pounds 500m would expand the
market by 80m tonnes.
While talks were continuing with the generators he could not agree that such
a result could be achieved at a cost of no more than Pounds 5 per tonne.
To Tory cheers, Mr Heseltine said the government would not be prepared to
legislate - as the committee recommended - to require the electricity
generators to take coal at a price and in a quantity that they judged to be
against their commercial interests.
A Labour motion condemning the government's failure to support manufacturing
industry and deploring the return of mass unemployment was defeated by 39
votes (302-263).

FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major triggers row on Scots water
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday stole the thunder of Scottish secretary Mr Ian Lang
in the Commons yesterday when he appeared to indicate that the government
had decided to press ahead with privatisation of the Scottish water
industry.
Questioned by a Scottish National party MP, Mr Major asserted that he had
'no reason to doubt that water privatisation in Scotland will be effective
and efficient as elsewhere'. He added: 'Privatisation means a better, more
efficient service for the consumer and no more subsidy from the taxpayer.'
His comments came minutes before the Scottish secretary's much-flagged
statement on the government's 'taking stock' exercise set out in a white
paper on administrative changes in Scotland. Mr Lang's statement was
completely overshadowed by the prime minister's comments.
Mr Major's remarks were immediately jumped on by Labour, who accused him of
indicating 'almost by sleight of hand' that privatisation would be
introduced in Scotland contrary to the wishes of the Scottish people.
Downing Street later played down the significance of the prime minister's
remarks, saying he was not trying to pre-empt the consultation process on
Scottish water. But it was clear from the tone of the comments that Mr
Major's personal inclination was to push ahead.
The Scottish Office is studying responses to a consultation paper on
Scottish water, now administered by regional councils. The paper listed
several alternatives, including the sale of water companies, the franchising
of water services to the private sector by local authorities and the status
quo.
There are signs that ministers accept that outright privatisation would be
difficult within this parliament, since water companies would have to be
created from the councils and would then have to establish a track record
before they could be sold.
An ICM opinion poll in The Scotsman newspaper this week showed that 86 per
cent of those asked, and 72 per cent of Tories, thought water should stay in
the hands of councils.
Mr Lang's statement received a predictably dismissive welcome from the
opposition benches, with MPs cheering ironically every new measure that was
announced.
Mr Tom Clarke, shadow Scottish secretary, described it as 'sheer tokenism,
talking shops and timid and tired policies'. Mr Alex Salmond, the Scottish
National Party leader, said it amounted to 'a constitutional charade'.
The package of measures unveiled by Mr Lang aims to improve parliament's
handling of Scottish affairs, and intends to both enhance Scotland's status
in the UK and stave off Scottish demands for constitutional change.

<TEXT>
The Scottish grand committee, which comprises all 72 Scottish MPs, would
debate the principle of bills relating solely to Scotland before they
received their second reading, so there would be no second reading debate in
the Commons. Second and third reading votes would still be taken in the
House.
The committee would stage extra sessions of Scottish question time,
currently held monthly, and could question Scottish ministers and law
officers from the House of Lords. Scottish Office ministers might make
statements to the committee instead of to the whole house, and short
adjournment debates might be held at the end of committee sessions.
The Scottish Office will take control of training from the Department of
Employment, while the Department of Trade and Industry will hand over
responsibility for some industrial assistance schemes. The Civil Aviation
Authority will cede control of Highlands and Islands Airports, which
operates eight Highland airports, to the Scottish Office. Within Scotland,
Scottish Office departments based in Edinburgh and Glasgow might be moved.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems agree to differ on
referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT MPs are to decide individually whether to support a
referendum on Maastricht when the amendment comes before the Commons. The
arrangement is a tacit admission that they have had to agree to differ.
The acceptance of a free vote on a referendum reflects differences of view
in the party over aspects of their tactics on Maastricht.
There were, for example, various opinions about what line the party should
have taken if, instead of continuing to oppose the Labour amendment which
caused Monday's humiliating government defeat, ministers had said that they
accepted its principle and would alter the bill when it reached the House of
Lords.
Tactics will be discussed again today at the weekly meeting of the 20 MPs.
The party is unmoved by Tory accusations of 'hypocrisy' in its support for
the Labour amendment on Monday, and points out the delays in the bill that
are attributable to the government.
While Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, has called for a referendum on
Maastricht, it was noticeably absent from the party conference motion on
Europe last autumn. Government whips know that Liberal Democrat support is
vital on procedural motions, and have been in constant touch with the party
since January, when the extensive Commons discussions on the legislation
really got under way.
The Liberal Democrats have often voted with the government on motions to
close debate, because they want to make progress with the bill, and to
underline their 'pro-European' credentials. This also underlay their
critical support for the Tories in the 'paving' debate on Maastricht last
autumn, when the government had a majority of just three votes.
Little incentive has been offered to support the Tories on issues of
substance where the government risks defeat. The Liberal Democrat commitment
to proportional representation - to which the government is strongly opposed
 -means that ministers cannot move far enough to satisfy them.
While the party has still to take final decisions on its attitude towards
the amendments on economic and monetary union which could unite Labour and
the Euro-sceptics, it is already so firmly committed to the social chapter
that the government has no real chance of detaching the Liberal Democrat MPs
from its other opponents on these amendments.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: DTI to move part of oil and gas
office to Aberdeen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to move 60 geologists and engineers with the Department of
Trade and Industry's oil and gas division from London to Aberdeen to set up
an office to deal with North Sea oil development.
Many Scottish businessman and politicians have long been pressing for the
whole of the Petroleum Engineering Directorate to be moved to Aberdeen in
order to strengthen the city as a centre of oil and gas expertise.
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said that consultants had found 'no clear
case' for doing this.
The new Aberdeen office, he said, would provide services previously
available only in London and would 'take the nationwide lead in the issue of
field development consents'. If, as expected, more oil companies moved from
London to Aberdeen to be near the directorate the office would be expanded
to 80 staff.
A study by accountants Ernst &amp; Young showed, however, that there would be a
loss of business efficiency to the DTI if the whole of the directorate went
to Aberdeen. It acknowledged there would be a 'small gain' in promoting an
agglomeration of industries and skills in Aberdeen, which should improve the
UK international position in offshore supplies and services.
It said the impact of the move on the location of other organisations would
be small and the effect on the costs and efficiency of oil companies would
be neutral. There would be a very small financial cost to the DTI.
Mr Ian Wood, chairman of the Aberdeen-based Wood Group, an offshore service
company, said the decision was a 'step in the right direction'. Mr Wood is a
leading campaigner for moving the whole directorate to Aberdeen.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell pensions to be paid from
Cuckney fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE charitable trust chaired by Sir John Cuckney will step in to meet
payments to the Maxwell pensioners once the government's Pounds 2.5m
'drip-feed' emergency fund runs out. It is expected to run out next month.
The Cuckney fund, collected from businesses that had dealings with the
Maxwell companies, is to step in because trustees for the Mirror Group
Pension scheme are blocking a proposal that would allow Maxwell pensioners
to start drawing monthly payments on the Pounds 188m Common Investment Fund
which holds the assets of all four schemes.
The trustees for the four Maxwell schemes have to agree on the basis of
distribution from the fund before any scheme can receive money.
While MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners welcome the
intervention by the Pounds 6m Cuckney fund, they are becoming increasingly
impatient with the delay in reaching an agreement which would allow initial
payments to be made from the Common Investment Fund.
'It is good news for the pensioners that Sir John Cuckney has raised this
money, but appalling news that there have still not been allocations from
the Common Investment Fund,' Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead and
chairman of the cross-party Commons social security committee, said
yesterday. The trustees of the pension schemes have been summoned to answer
questions from the committee, and are likely to appear late next month. MPs
fear that using the Cuckney fund to make payments before the CIF is
allocated will mean that there is less available for the schemes which get
little or nothing from the final allocation.
The Maxwell pensioners also expressed concern. Mr Kenneth Trench of the
Maxwell Pensioners' Action Group said: 'This move simply shows an uncaring
government turning its back on its moral responsibility to help the
pensioners. It means that Pounds 6m-worth of charitable funds meant to
relieve hardship are to be used unfairly.'

FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: An algebra lesson in Tory
subversion - Ivo Dawnay goes underground with Bill Cash and his
anti-Maastricht 'guerrilla force'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is a geographical epicentre for British political conspiracies it
lies only a few hundred yards from the Palace of Westminster.
Well within the summons of the division bell, bounded by Westminster School
and Conservative Central Office, the network of early eighteenth century
streets around Smith Square have harboured well-heeled subversives for time
immemorial.
It was here, in fiction, that CP Snow set late-night liaisons in his book
The Corridors of Power. Here, too, Mr Norman Lamont established Mr John
Major's campaign headquarters in November 1990.
Not long after, it was to Great College Street - the home of Lord MacAlpine,
the former Tory party treasurer - that the woman he replaced retreated to
lick her wounds. How appropriate, then, that Mr Bill Cash, arch Euro-sceptic
and most prominent of Mr Major's Tory enemies, has set up his camp under her
anti-Maastricht standard in the same premises.
For visitors to the modest terrace, it is the parallels with Downing Street
itself that strike first. Although tiny by comparison, the juxtaposition of
antique furnishings and fax machines, period pictures and computer screens
echoes the ambience of deadly-serious - if gentlemanly - amateurism that
pervades the prime minister's residence.
As in Downing Street, the downstairs area is a hive of worker bees - the
glint of history-in-the-making in their eyes. At the computer screen is
Keith, a forty-something environmentalist who abandoned greenery to take up
arms for Cash and country, and now collates the names of other footsoldiers
for future mobilisation.
Then there is William Sitwell, 23-year-old great nephew of the late Edith,
who, in a reversal of Byronic tradition, returned from sybaritic
tour-guiding on the Greek islands to fight for British independence.
Behind him, in the garden room, sits Great College Street's own garden girl,
Sally Rickard, an interior decorator, who says she had been 'praying for two
years about the state of the nation' before she received the call.
Ms Rickard believes fervently that the other Europeans' agenda is inspired
by 'jealousy' for Britain's unique way of life. 'They don't want us to have
what we've got, so they want to dissolve it - all our assets are at stake,'
she warns apocalyptically.
All these and the 'two Davids' - policy crunchers and Hansard trawlers
buried in the basement - are merely the outward manifestations of a
countrywide network of anti-Maastrichtians, all dedicated to the cause.
Mr Cash himself, not unlike the prime minister, sits upstairs in Lord
MacAlpine's impeccable drawing room. Nurtured by his wife Biddy, and cups of
traditional British instant coffee, he plots the next twist to the
Maastricht saga in endless telephone calls to sublime constitutional lawyers
or ridiculous tabloid pressmen.
Talking to Mr Cash these days is a bit like an algebra lesson as amendments
and clauses merge in a stream of numbers and letters testifying to the
thoroughness with which he has navigated the darker backwaters of the
treaty.
The idea of Great College Street, he says, is to provide a guerrilla
secretariat, civil service and think tank to harry, second guess and
bamboozle the government. Every day it sends a 'fact sheet' to all
Conservative MPs, aimed at arming them against what he describes as the
'outrageous disinformation' disseminated by official sources.
For those still able to see anything amusing about the endless Maastricht
debate, the wry aspect of Mr Cash's crusade is that it is being fought by a
group of people who are socially and politically identical to their enemies
 -a Sloane civil war transferred to genteel Westminster.
The reason that Mr Cash's irregulars have loyalist Whitehall on the ropes is
that his own team of 'super' girls and boys has tapped that most dangerous
and un-Toryish quality: conviction.

FT  10 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Turkey and Azerbaijan sign oil pipeline
accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY and Azerbaijan yesterday agreed to build a pipeline from the Baku
oilfields to the Turkish Mediterranean. The deal, signed in Ankara by Mr
Suleyman Demirel, Turkish prime minister, and Mr Sabit Bagirov, Azerbaijani
oil minister, ends months of uncertainty about the route of the proposed
Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 980m) pipeline to take Azerbaijani crude to western
markets.
Yesterday's accord envisages a route via Iran and the small Azerbaijani
enclave of Nachievan before ending at Ceyhan on the Turkish Mediterranean,
using the existing twin Iraqi pipeline now closed because of UN sanctions
against Baghdad.
Last month a consortium of Botas, Turkey's state-owned pipeline company, and
Azerbaijan's state oil company, together with BP and the US oil and
engineering groups Pennzoil, Amoco and McDerm-ott, concluded a feasibility
study of three possible routes, through Georgia or Russia to the Black Sea,
or the Araz valley to the Mediterranean.
The agreement leaves the door open for Kazakhstan, an important oil
producer, and Turkmenistan, a large gas producer, to join. The 1,060km pipe
will have 40m tonnes capacity, Azerbaijan accounting for 25m tonnes, with
the balance used by Kazakhstan. Azerbaijan's output is estimated at 10m-12m
tonnes, but is projected to increase to 40m tonnes by 1996-97.
Kazakhstan is planning to export its production via a pipeline to Russia's
Black Sea port of Novorossysk.
Last month the Turkish Foreign Ministry signalled its disapproval of the
Kazakh plan. Under the 1936 Montreux convention, ships have unhindered
passage through the Bosporus. But Turkey has warned that the increased
tanker traffic could impede shipping, already congested with the opening of
the Danube-Rhine Canal and the growing demand from the new Black Sea states.

FT  10 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Clinton promises aircraft subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday gave strong support to the US-EC pact
governing Airbus but promised to counter European subsidies with
'significant' government investment in new technology for the next
generation of US aircraft.
Speaking at a news conference with President Francois Mitterrand, he
stressed that 'the (Airbus) agreement must be honoured'. He was echoing his
trade representative, Mr Mickey Kantor, who appeared before the Senate
finance committee yesterday to testify about a range of trade issues.
Under questioning, Mr Kantor rejected a suggestion that the US would bring a
countervailing duty case against the EC. However, he complained about EC
accounting practices. The US had not had access to information on repayment
by Airbus of government loans, he said, adding that if the loans were not
being repaid, the US might withdraw from the pact.
On the subject of Japan, Mr Kantor said the administration was enthusiastic
about a proposal to address the US deficit by negotiating a series of
specific trade targets in order to boost US manufactured exports. Failure to
achieve these 'temporary quantitative indicators' within an agreed time span
would result either in further negotiated measures or US sanctions.
On other subjects he suggested:
The negotiating agenda had been set for the side agreements on labour and
the environment necessary to implement the North American Free Trade
Agreement by January 1, 1994. The entire package might be sent to Congress
by early summer.
Blame for the failure to conclude a Gatt agreement rested on 'the three-year
deadlock between the rest of the world and the EC over agriculture, and
Japan, which took the opportunity of the stalemate to 'avoid contributing
meaningfully' to the talks.

FT  10 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC defends new trade group plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC officials yesterday launched an attack on environmental groups' claims
that proposals for a Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) would weaken
countries' ability to protect the environment.
In a strongly-worded letter to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), a
prominent opponent of an MTO, Mr Tran van Thinh, EC ambassador to Gatt, said
the MTO would be a democratic, rules-governed body taking decisions by
members' consensus. It would not be, as WWF and others had implied, a
supra-national body with powers to impose policies on weaker, developing
countries, Mr Tran added.
'The Uruguay Round agreements will neither prevent governments protecting
the environment nor force on them policies hampering their development.'
Existing exceptions in Gatt to protect human, animal or plant health would
be strengthened. The MTO would offer 'a continuous negotiating forum to
develop further the trade and environment relationship'. The MTO, first
proposed by the EC and Canada in 1990, would subsume Gatt and envisaged
sister-bodies on services and intellectual property, enforcing trade rules
with tighter disputes procedure.
Trade officials in Geneva said yesterday that several governments planned to
follow the EC in rebutting what they see as a misleading campaign by the WWF
and other groups against the MTO and related draft accords under discussion
in the Uruguay Round.

FT  10 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Poorest LDCs face decline, says Unctad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PER capita incomes in the very poorest developing countries have fallen for
the past three years and fragile economic reform programmes are threatened
by recession and inadequate international support, the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development said yesterday.
In its latest annual report* on the 47 least developed countries, as defined
by the UN, Unctad projects a 1.4 per cent increase in total LDC output this
year, after no growth in 1991 and a slight decline in 1990, but expects per
capita incomes to show a new decline.
The recent economic performance of LDCs, which have a total population of
500m, compares with growth averaging 2.5 per cent a year between 1985 and
1989. LDCs have also lagged behind developing countries as a whole, whose
output rose by over 3 per cent in 1991.
The Unctad report highlights big divergences in performance between LDCs. In
many countries afflicted by civil war and natural disasters, such as
Somalia, Afghanistan, Liberia, Mozambique and Ethiopia, 'the development
process has come to a virtual standstill'.
Elsewhere, some more politically stable countries have achieved respectable
growth rates and raised per capita incomes, including Botswana, Lesotho, the
Maldives, Nepal, Bangladesh and Uganda.
But Unctad, main UN forum for debate of north-south issues, says external
factors have also been responsible for the LDCs' problems. The recession has
limited trade, falling commodity prices have cut revenues, and private
remittances from abroad, a big source of foreign exchange for some LDCs,
have declined due to foreign-labour cuts in industrialised and developing
countries.
Rich countries, it adds, have failed to fulfil pledges made in the UN action
programme for LDCs agreed in 1990, including increased aid flows, action to
tackle LDC indebtedness (most of which is owed to governments) and measures
to improve LDC access to industrial markets.
The report notes fears that eastern Europe's financing needs may further
reduce the resource pool for LDC development. Failure by the west to support
painful reforms in LDCs risks halting or reversing the process, with
far-reaching consequences including 'social and economic collapse,
ecological damage, food insecurity, and huge population displacement.'

FT  10 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Hills ordered dumping laws study -
Last-minute decision by former US trade representative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG complaints by US exporters led Mrs Carla Hills, the former US trade
representative, to order a controversial two-year study of the US dumping
and subsidy laws just five days before leaving office, according to Mr
Julius Katz, Mrs Hills' former deputy.
The trade representative's staff had for many months discussed having the
bipartisan International Trade Commission take 'a good, hard look' at the
effects of the 'unfair' trade regime in a balanced, non-partisan way, Mr
Katz said. Because this would be unpopular in the Congress, it was felt that
Mrs Hills could more easily make the request than her successor, Mr Mickey
Kantor, just starting his term in office and anxious to maintain good
relations with Capitol Hill.
Mr Katz said, although protection against dumping and subsidies was
necessary, the rules adopted by both the US and the EC had become
increasingly 'arbitrary and restrictive'. The number of countries adopting
similar regimes had proliferated, so that American exporters now had to
worry that they would be denied market share under similar rules.
Controversy over the US anti-dumping and subsidies regime may stand in the
way of a Uruguay Round deal. The US is insisting on amending the final
negotiating text which would make it easier for exporting countries to
challenge the anti-dumping and subsidies findings.
'We had no political reason for calling for the study,' Mr Katz said. The
proposal - for an in-depth look at the effects of dumping and subsidies as
well as the impact of the subsequent duties on the US economy - came from
the office's career staff.
Mrs Hills apparently reckoned without the intervention of the Democratic
chairman of the International Trade Commission. Mr Don Newquist last week
sent the proposal for the study to Mr Kantor, giving him 90 days to shelve
it if he wishes. He has yet to comment on the matter.
A spokesman for Mr Newquist said the Trade Representative's Office had
failed to perform the detailed consultations with the ITC usual when studies
were requested. He suggested that the budget-cutting Clinton administration
might have different priorities, and the agency was already loaded with a
time-consuming study agenda.
Mr Katz said Mrs Hills had called the chairman about the study and had
spoken with his counsel, Mr Fred Beavers. After the call it was decided to
stretch the timing of the study from 1994 to 1995, to keep it separate from
election year politics. Mr Beavers said Mrs Hills had simply informed him of
the study without asking for Commission suggestions.

ONTARIO HYDRO, one of North America's biggest utilities, is cutting staff by
a further 4,500, bringing planned reductions since late last year to 6,000,
writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
This is part of the utility's restructuring to deal with a debt crisis and a
30 per cent increase in power rates over the past three years.
Total payroll will decline to 23,000 mainly through attrition and early
retirement, said Mr Maurice Strong, the chairman. Negotiations will begin
soon with the unions.
A programme to re-tube the Bruce A nuclear reactors, at a cost of nearly
CDollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn), is being deferred indefinitely and a Bruce
heavy water plant will close in 1994. About CDollars 10bn is to be cut from
the utility's CDollars 30bn 10-year capital spending programme.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Fiscal fever infects congressmen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress's Democratic majority is set to agree on even deeper cuts in
spending than those proposed by President Bill Clinton.
The House of Representatives budget committee is expected to vote today on a
budget resolution that will make extra spending cuts totalling Dollars 63bn
(Pounds 44bn) over five years on top of Mr Clinton's own plan, which had
aimed to trim government spending over the period by a net Dollars 222bn.
Agreement on the budget resolution is the latest stage in a fever of fiscal
responsibility that has infected liberal spenders, conservative farm
subsidisers and fervent opponents of tax increases alike.
President Clinton first agreed on an additional Dollars 55bn of spending
cuts with Democratic party leaders in the House of Representatives on Monday
night, but further meetings on Capitol Hill prompted Democrats on the House
budget committee to expand those cuts to Dollars 63bn, and Senate Democrats
are working on even larger cuts.
When Mr Clinton announced his budget plan last month, it was widely assumed
he would have trouble keeping its spending cuts intact. Instead,
congressional Democrats have outdone him.
The White House is now worried if it will be able to preserve the increased
spending on infrastructure, technology, the environment and education that
also forms part of the Clinton economic plan. Some Democrats are seeking, in
particular, to trim the Dollars 16.3bn package intended to provide a
short-term stimulus to the economy.
But when detailed cuts are taken line by line in appropriations bills
congressmen are expected to lose much of their new-found enthusiasm for
fiscal discipline as they fight to preserve the programmes that benefit
their districts.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Drugs chief sees need for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OLIVE branch was held out to the US administration yesterday by Mr Henry
Wendt, chairman of the Anglo-American drugs company SmithKline Beecham. He
called for a new social contract between the pharmaceutical industry and
society.
'We must show President Clinton and his first lady the economic benefits of
using pharmaceuticals. We must show our customers - those that pay for drugs
 -that they are good value,' he said.
'We need acts not words. Part of that involves keeping down prices,' he told
the last day of the FT pharmaceuticals conference in London.
The industry had reacted too slowly to concerns about pricing by relying on
national trade associations, Mr Wendt said. These found it easiest to defend
the status quo. Senior executives had not shown sufficient leadership. 'We
are at the eleventh hour and the 59th minute.'
The US administration is scheduled to announce its healthcare reforms on May
1. The first lady, Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, is heading the White House
task force on the issue. Last month President Bill Clinton said he had been
shocked by the cost of medicines and the amount the drugs groups spent on
marketing and advertising.
Mr Wendt admitted that company promises to limit average increases in drug
prices to the inflation rate had been ambiguous. Some medicine prices had
risen more than inflation, even if a group's average price had not.
Drugs groups would have to look at their cost base, said Mr Wendt. His
company was looking at every aspect of its business.
He urged the industry to improve a tarnished image that made it an easy
target for politicians. The industry had to regain society's trust.
'Our industry now ranks close to the bottom in most opinion surveys in terms
of perceived social responsibility and contribution to the common good. . .
. We must exclude less than honourable behaviour. . . . there should be an
end to financial inducements to doctors.' He called for a new rigorous
marketing code that could stamp out abuses on a worldwide basis.
In order to prove the cost-benefit of drugs, he suggested international
cost-effectiveness trials run by third parties.

FT  10 MAR 93 / US and France seek early G7 talks: Western leaders stress
Russia's urgent need for aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENTS Bill Clinton and Francois Mitterrand yesterday called for greater
urgency in helping Russia with western aid.
Both men acknowledged Japan's opposition to the idea of holding an emergency
summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations before the regular
summit to be held in Tokyo in July, but said the G7 must move before that.
'I don't believe we can wait until July,' President Clinton said after a
morning meeting with Mr Mitterrand in Washington.
An emergency G7 meeting would probably be useful but might not be possible
in the face of Japan's objections. Nevertheless, the west must move
'aggressively' to help Russia, which might otherwise be forced to look
increasingly to arms sales as the only way of earning hard currency, Mr
Clinton said. Mr Mitterrand, who had advocated an emergency G7 meeting,
added that Japan appeared to misunderstand the urgency of the problems
facing eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
White House officials later said a summit of heads of state and government
might not be the only way to address the pressing needs of Russia and the
other former Soviet republics, and suggested a meeting of G7 foreign or
finance ministers might be called.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has added his voice to the campaign to aid Russia,
according to diplomats, by writing to fellow G7 leaders urging their support
for Mr Yeltsin in his constitutional struggle.
In particular, Mr Kohl has passed on a query from Mr Yeltsin asking for
confirmation of western political support if he is forced to introduce
emergency measures in Russia. The letter reports Mr Yeltsin's confidence
that the Russian military will support him if he seeks emergency powers, the
diplomats said. It also spells out Mr Yeltsin's determination to make one
final effort at reaching agreement with the Russian parliament, while
expressing some doubt about the likelihood of such a deal.
Mr Clinton and Mr Mitterrand agreed on a cautious approach to the idea of
committing more troops to Bosnia. Both said they were willing to increase
their forces only after a peace deal along lines proposed by Mr Cyrus Vance
and Lord Owen had been reached. It was announced in Paris yesterday that Mr
Mitterrand is to host talks tomorrow between the peace negotiators and
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.
Trade issues, which have set France and the US at loggerheads recently, were
reserved for later discussion over lunch, but both presidents struck a
conciliatory note, with Mr Clinton suggesting his recent aggressive comments
about European subsidies to the Airbus consortium might have been
misinterpreted.
Mr Mitterrand said agreement on the Uruguay Round of talks on updating the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was important, but could not be
achieved by piecemeal negotiations.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Reno 'would be tough on crime'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MS JANET Reno promised Congress yesterday she would be a tough law and order
attorney-general whose priorities would be 'attacking violent crime, drug
trafficking and public corruption'.
She told the Senate judiciary committee at the opening of her confirmation
hearings she would ensure civil rights laws and rules protecting the
environment would be rigorously enforced. Polluters should be 'forced to
clean up the mess they have left behind'.
Ms Reno would be the first woman attorney-general if confirmed in office.
This appeared in little doubt yesterday, as the committee greeted her with
applause and initial questioning from senators of both parties revealed
little controversy about her background and qualifications.
Senator Joseph Biden, the Democratic chairman, and Senator Orrin Hatch, the
ranking Republican, said they were satisfied there were no skeletons in her
closet such as derailed two earlier candidates.
Senator Hatch criticised the 'hate-mongering campaign' to which, he said,
she had been subject; Senator Alan Simpson, Republican (Wyoming), remarked
over the weekend that confirmation hearings had too often been marked by
'character assassination'.
Senator Biden elicited from Ms Reno a commitment to crack down on domestic
violence, as she had in her 15 years as a Florida state prosecutor. 'We need
to send a clear message,' she said, 'that that will not be tolerated.'
Senator Edward Kennedy (Massachusetts) urged her to work hard for effective
gun control; she said she would. Most of her testimony was devoted to her
own life, recalling her upbringing as the daughter of a Danish immigrant who
became a newsman in Miami.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Argentine balance of payments worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINE trade figures released this week showed the country's balance of
payments position deteriorated more rapidly last year than the government
has admitted.
The figures, which will be subject to one more revision before they are
final, showed Argentine trade swung into a deficit of Dollars 2.87bn (Pounds
2bn) last year after a 1991 surplus of Dollars 3.7bn.
This sharp deterioration has raised questions about the sustainability of
the government's economic policy, which is using the exchange rate - fixed
against the dollar since April 1991 and increasingly seen as overvalued - as
a central plank of its strategy to fight inflation.
The deficit was caused by a 79 per cent rise in imports last year to Dollars
14.84bn, while exports were little changed at Dollars 11.98bn. More worrying
to some economists was the pace of the deterioration from the first half
when there was a Dollars 1bn surplus to the second half when there was a
Dollars 3.9bn deficit.
Mr Geoffrey Dennis at James Capel in New York said he expected the deficit
would jump to Dollars 8bn this year, with the rate of growth of imports
slowing somewhat and that of exports rising. At just over 3 per cent of
gross domestic product the deficit would not be large in absolute terms and
hard currency reserves were substantial - sufficient to cover 10 months'
imports. Nonetheless, he believed the trade position was eroding so quickly
figures that a shift towards a crawling peg devaluation of the peso was
required.
The figures also indicated trade with the US and Brazil more than accounted
for the trade deficit: the shortfall in trade with the US was Dollars 1.82bn
and with Brazil Dollars 1.75bn. They showed a relatively small proportion of
imports were directly for consumption: capital goods and spare parts made up
38.2 per cent of imports, semi-finished goods 34.8 per cent and consumer
goods, including cars, 27 per cent.
The government has said the deficit will be constrained this year because of
imports levies imposed in November. Mr Juan Schiaretti, trade and industry
secretary, was quoted by Reuters saying latest figures from the customs
service showed a substantial fall in imports during the first two months of
1993. He gave no figures.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Deportees issue deadlocks peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Palestinians will not resume Middle East peace talks until Israel agrees
to stop deporting people from the occupied territories, its leading
negotiator said yesterday.
It was announced last night in Washington by US officials that the US and
Russia were today expected to issue formal invitations to the foreign
ministries of Israel, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon and to Palestinian leaders
to resume Arab-Israeli peace talks in Washington on April 20.
But Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi told Reuters in Jerusalem that the talks would
remain deadlocked as long as Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister,
reserved the right to deport people. Israel deported 415 Palestinians to
southern Lebanon in December and has so far refused to implement fully UN
Security Council resolution 799 which calls for their immediate return.
Mr Abdel-Shafi's assessment of the peace process came shortly before Britain
added its diplomatic weight to efforts to get the talks restarted by meeting
representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in London.
Mr Douglas Hogg, minister at the Foreign Office, ended a two-year British
ban on top-level contacts with the PLO in talks with Mr Faisal Husseini, the
leading Palestinian in the occupied territories, Mr Hael Fahoum, who heads
the PLO European section in Tunis, and Mr Afif Safieh, its London
representative.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said yesterday his
government would not be following the British example because of
disappointment at the PLO's failure to be of assistance on terrorism issues.
Britain informed the US in advance that it was resuming ministerial contacts
with the PLO and did not encounter any opposition. Israel, however,
complained about the resumption of British contacts, arguing that it would
damage the peace process.
Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, hoped that the British move and an
earlier Belgian decision to upgrade the Palestinian mission in Brussels
signalled a more positive European role in the peace process.
Mr Hogg said after his meeting with the three Palestinians that they
understood the importance of resuming bilateral negotiations with Israel.
'Further movement on the question of deportation would greatly facilitate
their ability to come back into the talks,' he added.
Mr Safieh described the meeting with Mr Hogg as 'warm, constructive and very
promising'.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Democracy where no one ever argues: Indonesia's president
will be re-elected unanimously today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S President Suharto is likely to get unanimous support from the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) today when it elects him into a sixth
term of office. The lack of opposition is part of Indonesia's 'consensus'
democracy, say ministers. But government critics believe it signals trouble
for when Mr Suharto, now 71, finally relinquishes power.
The assembly meets for 11 days every five years to ratify the government's
programme and vote for the president. Its five factions - the ruling Golkar
party, two opposition parties, military representatives and provincial
leaders - have always concurred on all economic and political issues.
Even demands by the small nationalistic, pro-Christian Indonesian Democratic
party for an electoral process less favourable to the ruling party were
withdrawn to avoid a vote, an act which 'shows a maturity of democracy in
our country,' says energy minister Mr Ginandjar Kartasasmita.
Investors in the Jakarta stock market have welcomed the prospect of five
more years of Mr Suharto. After a depressed second half of 1992, the
composite index has risen 13 per cent this year. Brokers say foreign buying
has increased ahead of the election.
Golkar dominated last year's general election for 400 of the 500 seats of
the lower parliament. Representatives of the armed forces, which have a
political role enshrined in the constitution, fill the remaining 100 places.
The 1,000-member assembly consists of the lower parliament and 500 members
appointed by the government.
Golkar has formed the government since 1971, the first election following Mr
Suharto's assumption of power in 1965. Political analysts worry that this
monopoly on power is storing up problems for the future.
Mr Cornelius Lay, a lecturer at the University of Indonesia, believes long
exclusion of opposition parties from power may produce radicalism as they
become disenchanted with the political process.
Mr Suharto, however, a former major-general, is unlikely to relax his grip.
Last week he criticised liberal democracy as failing to sustain development.
He reaffirmed the military as 'an inseparable part of our democracy'.
He is bolstered by a track record of economic growth averaging 6 per cent a
year over the last two decades. The proportion of the population living in
absolute poverty has fallen from 60 per cent in 1970 to under 15 per cent.
Annual per capita income has risen from Dollars 70 in the mid-1960s to over
Dollars 600 (Pounds 422) now.
Mr Suharto can also point to an influx of foreign investment worth Dollars
34bn over the last five years. Non-oil exports, driven by an increase in
manufacturing investment, have risen from Dollars 8.5bn in 1987 to an
estimated Dollars 21bn last year and are growing at 20 per cent a year.
However, some businessmen are concerned that Mr Suharto's next cabinet, to
be announced within two weeks, will reverse the trend toward economic
deregulation, where the government has liberalised the banking sector in
particular, and return to a policy of state intervention.
The government is already providing substantial funds for a state-owned
high-technology sector involved in aircraft, shipbuilding and munitions
manufacturing.
Donor agencies complain that what the government calls deregulation has to
date often
entailed transferring state monopolies to favoured private companies, while
the system of competitive tender is often disregarded by the government when
awarding contracts.
On balance, however, donors and businessmen are hopeful for continued
economic growth and, with the military playing a central role, a peaceful
transfer of power from Mr Suharto.
As one business executive explains, possibly the most delicate task is to
complete the smooth transition from the old generation military leaders (who
fought for independence) to the new generation.
There is still, however, no apparent successor to Mr Suharto. General Try
Sutrisno, the sole vice-presidential candidate and former aide to Mr
Suharto, is regarded by many officials as lacking charisma.
Senior diplomats believe General Wismoyo Arismunandar, deputy chief of army
staff and Mr Suharto's brother-in-law, is being groomed for the job. His
appointment, however, would antagonise government and military officials
keen to prevent the Suharto family, already powerful in business, becoming a
ruling dynasty.
What is apparent, say the government's critics, is that Indonesia's 185m
people will have little involvement in choosing the next leader. And the
three separatist movements in Aceh, Irian Jaya and East Timor are a reminder
that political stability is not assured. Without Mr Suharto and the depth of
authority he commands, Indonesia's 'consensus' democracy may begin to crack.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Gold seized from offices of Kanemaru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TEAM of investigators yesterday seized 100kg of gold bars from the Tokyo
office of Mr Shin Kanemaru, until last year a powerful figure in the Liberal
Democratic party (LDP) and the godfather of Japanese politics.
The Tokyo prosecutors' office, which is investigating Mr Kanemaru's alleged
tax evasion, found gold bars worth about Y1bn (Pounds 5.84m) in the office
in Nagatcho, close to the parliament in central Tokyo.
As gold can be purchased anonymously, it is alleged that Mr Kanemaru
accumulated his holdings to avoid paying income tax. Mr Kanemaru faces
allegations that he used some of the political funds he collected for his
personal purposes. He and his private secretary were arrested on Saturday
over alleged tax evasion between 1987 and 1989 which could amount to more
than Y400m.
Mr Kanemaru resigned from parliament in October after being fined Y200,000
following his admission that he received an illegal political donation of
Y500m from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, a scandal-tainted trucking company.
During the late 1980s Mr Kanemaru established his position as the most
powerful figure within the then Takeshita faction, which dominated the
ruling LDP, through his legendary ability to raise money.
Estimates of Mr Kanemaru's liquid assets, largely held in forms which do not
need to be registered with the authorities, vary.
However it is estimated that in addition to the Y1bn in gold bars, he also
held between Y2.8bn and Y5bn in discount bank bonds. NHK, the broadcasting
corporation, reported that Mr Kanemaru's hidden assets are thought to be
worth Y7bn.
Discount bonds, which Mr Kanemaru began to buy in 1984, can be purchased
anonymously. Opposition party leaders alleged that Mr Kanemaru's decision to
keep such large sums in unregistered bonds and gold bars was evidence that
he was trying to avoid paying tax.
Investigators disclosed that in the days before his arrest Mr Kanemaru's
aides, aware that an investigation was under way, moved large quantities of
bonds, gold and cash between Mr Kanemaru's house, offices and other
locations.
Mr Kanemaru and his secretary are due to be charged by March 13 and could
remain in custody at the Tokyo detention centre until March 17.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW DELHI is rethinking its hard line on Moslem militants in India's Kashmir
region and is working on a political settlement to end three years of bloody
rebellion there, a government spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from
New Delhi.
The spokesman said Mr Rajesh Pilot, junior home (interior) minister, had a
meeting with the militants during a visit last month to high-security
detention centres in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
The state governor, Mr Girish Saxena, was behind the talks. He was quoted as
telling New Delhi: 'The time has come when politicians should become more
active in the state.'
The spokesman said Mr Saxena endorsed New Delhi's softer line, which
involves a shake-up of the local administration and more patrolling on the
border with Pakistan. He did not rule out talks with Moslem militants.
Until now India has refused to hold talks with militants until they
surrender arms and agree not to discuss secession.
Mr Saxena strongly favoured moves on the political front which would lead to
the resumption of a political process in the Kashmir valley, the spokesman
said.
India has ruled the Himalayan state directly from New Delhi since Moslem
rebels started fighting in earnest for secession from Hindu-majority India
in 1990, forcing the suspension of the elected state assembly.
About 8,500 people have been killed in the quest for independence or merger
with Pakistan, which controls a third of Kashmir.
India and Pakistan have gone to war twice over Kashmir since they became
independent from Britain in 1947. New Delhi accuses Islamabad of supporting
the rebels, a charge Pakistan denies.
But Mr Pilot, who came to the home ministry in a cabinet reshuffle last
month, is known for what he calls a pragmatic view of the conflict.

<TEXT>
FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer company, is cutting recruitment
drastically and shaking up management in an effort to improve its poor
performance, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
Fujitsu will reduce the number of new graduates it takes next year to 300
compared with the 2,200 recruits it will welcome this March.
The move underlines the severity of Japan's slowdown and reflects the
growing view that further cuts will be needed despite hopes of recovery
soon.
Fujitsu is suffering in the face of intense competition in the computer
market, and desperately needs to restructure its operations. It employs
166,000.
In October the company forecast a 50 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to
Y20bn (Pounds 117m) on revenues of Y2,470bn but is increasingly unlikely to
meet that forecast.
In April the company will introduce a management assessment programme,
linked to managers' bonuses.

FT  10 MAR 93 / S Korea's new leader challenges the political old guard

<TEXT>
MR Kim Young-sam has turned out to be a political 'Trojan Horse' since
becoming South Korea's president almost two weeks ago.
Mr Kim entered the presidential Blue House under the banner of the ruling
Democratic Liberal Party, but he has acted more as the opposition leader he
once was by challenging the political establishment.
'No one expected the breadth of the changes that Kim has introduced to sweep
out the old guard,' said one Western diplomat. 'He's blasting away at all
fronts as rapidly as possible to keep his opponents off balance.'
But there are already signs that Mr Kim is provoking a backlash. His
political skills may soon be put to the test as he tries to protect his
reforms while maintaining the momentum for change.
There is little doubt that the new president has trodden on the toes of some
key institutional powers. He appointed political reformers to the Blue House
and his cabinet, while largely ignoring politicians from the DLP's dominant
conservative faction.
He also named political loyalists from his minority group to head the DLP
instead of choosing a cross-section of officials from the party's competing
factions.
The new president has quickly moved to impose civilian control over the
military by ousting the hardline army chief of staff and the head of
military intelligence. He also ordered a purge of the once-feared Agency for
National Security Planning, the country's espionage organisation.
He appears to be settling personal scores in the process. Prosecutors
yesterday sought an arrest warrant for Mr Chang Se-dong, a former NSP
director who is accused of arranging attacks on rallies of Mr Kim's
opposition party in 1987.
Few ever questioned Mr Kim's commitment to democratic reform since he
opposed the military dictatorship for three decades. But many have been
surprised by the decisiveness that he has displayed in implementing change
because he lacks a widespread power base, in spite of joining the ruling
party in 1990.
Nonetheless, 'one should not underestimate the potential source of
opposition against Mr Kim,' explains one seasoned political observer.
The first indication of resistance came in a series of newspaper disclosures
last week about alleged past unethical actions by several of the
newly-appointed cabinet ministers.
The printed exposes, which would have unthinkable a few years ago when the
media was tightly muzzled, proved highly embarrassing since Mr Kim had
promised to install a clean government as part of his anti-corruption drive.
He immediately sacked three ministers.
The Blue House believes that details of the transgressions were leaked to
the press by the political opponents who had access to intelligence
dossiers.
Although a military coup remains a remote possibility, the incident reveals
that dismissed army officers and intelligence agents could play a
mischievous role in creating discontent against Mr Kim.
Mr Kim must also maintain firm control over the faction-ridden DLP, although
his position appears secure for the moment since most of his main rivals
left the party in protest after he received the DLP presidential nomination
last year.
But he may find it difficult to instil loyalty among DLP legislators if he
adheres to his promise not to accept political contributions from business
and distribute the funds to the party members. The powerful bureaucracy
could also pose problems for Mr Kim. Although many of his ministers are
experts in their fields, they lack administrative experience and
consequently may fail to gain control of their organisations. In pushing
through reforms, Mr Kim does have allies. One is business. Although the
Seoul bourse initially reacted adversely to some of his anti-corruption
measures because of the chilling effect they would have on stock trading,
business leaders seem pleased with the president's programme of economic
deregulation and his gradual approach toward reform of big business.
Mr Kim has also gained wide public support because of his anti-corruption
campaign and his democratic reforms. If Mr Kim can maintain the public
trust, his may yet achieve his goal of creating a 'New Korea.'

FT  10 MAR 93 / S Africa plan focuses on equality: Philip Gawith and Patti
Waldmeir report on a radical economic programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH and PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African government yesterday launched its most radical economic
restructuring programme since it took power in 1948.
The programme, which reflects a new emphasis on equality, would touch almost
every aspect of economic life.
It aims to increase the amount of investment in relation to gross domestic
product to improve productivity and to re-establish the stable financial
environment without which investors cannot prosper.
It is a classic supply-side restructuring programme - but with a human face,
designed to make it palatable to opposition political forces whose approval
must be gained if it is to succeed. Initial union reaction was positive,
with a leading union economist describing the plan as a useful starting
point rather than rejecting it out of hand.
The changes required to effect it are enormous.
They include:
Reducing government current expenditure to 20.1 per cent of GDP in 1997 from
26.8 per cent in 1992;
Lowering the company tax rate to 40 per cent from 48 per cent, and the
individual's marginal rate to 40 per cent from 43 per cent, by 1997;
Reducing tariff barriers on imports to 18 per cent (possibly 14 per cent) in
1997 from 27 per cent at present;
Keeping real wage increases to 0.75 per cent per annum;
Taking a tougher line on anti-competitive behaviour, price-fixing and
collusion;
Balancing the budget by 1997. (Last year's deficit represented 9 per cent of
GDP);
Phasing out exchange control;
Success will depend on wage restraint from the unions and an inflow of
foreign capital equivalent to 2.8 per cent of GDP in the mid 1990s, tailing
off later (largely from international finance institutions).
It will also depend on a strong government's ability to push through
unpalatable reforms - at a time when Pretoria is about to hand over to a
power-sharing government which could prove weak and fractious.
The programme is published against a background of widespread acceptance of
the pressing need for fundamental economic restructuring.
'South Africa cannot afford another decade of poor economic growth, since
this will only lead to greater unemployment, poverty, violence and social
instability,' comments Mr Derek Keys, minister of finance and the driving
force behind the document, in the foreword.
At the heart of the programme is the simple assumption that levels of
investment, and productivity of that investment, must be raised if South
Africa is to meet its daunting development challenge.
Fiscal and monetary discipline the improved functioning of product and
labour markets and liberalised trade and financial markets are among the
programme's goals.
The focus is on providing long-term solutions to structural problems, rather
than short term palliatives. The approach will be gradual as the government
believes the economy, and the society are too sick to survive a 'big bang'
approach.
Government officials acknowledge they have long paid lip service to economic
reform.
And while some progress has been made - for example in monetary policy and
agriculture - it took the deepening economic crisis and the appointment last
May of Mr Keys, to produce a comprehensive programme.
While the programme is focused on the supply side, it makes clear that
growth is not seen as being more important than equality.
The document notes 'the new political understanding of the nature of the
South African economy . . . accepts that the process of economic growth must
be seen as but a central feature of the broader process of economic
development of the country and its people.'
In the past they have always insisted that growth alone was enough to cope
with poverty.
'What is envisaged is a process of structural adjustment in the developed
market economy and a reconstruction of its less-developed socio-economic
framework, in particular the equitable access of all South Africans to all
opportunities in the economy.'
During the difficult political transition to democracy, the government would
provide a package of measures including labour intensive public work
schemes, unemployment insurance and special training programmes.
Mr Keys has been careful to stress that the restructuring proposals are not
prescriptive, but are meant to provide a platform for debate.
But his officials make clear that reform will begin with next week's budget.
'It may have more teeth than people would like to see' says Mr Jacobs.
The document highlights constraints on growth: in the short term, a large
fiscal deficit could crowd out a private investment revival, and balance of
payments problems will constrain growth if large net capital outflows cannot
be stemmed.
The longer term constraint is the legacy of apartheid - defects in the
socio-economic system, such as large distances between industrial centres
and labour force accommodation, and lack of education and skills which would
'prevent the full participation in the growth process by the country's large
developing community.'

FT  10 MAR 93 / IG Metall calls strike in bankrupt east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IG Metall, the German engineering workers' union, yesterday decided to go
ahead with strike action in east Germany in protest at the cancellation of
their wage contract by eastern employers.
The union's national advisory council made their decision in spite of the
fact that most of the former state-owned plants in east Germany are
effectively bankrupt. Moreover, 80 per cent of the trade union's eastern
members are already unemployed.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the union leader, said token strikes would be called
from April 1, and a ballot for a full strike was being considered.
The workers are demanding that their wage contract, which provides for a 26
per cent pay rise on April 1, and full equalisation of eastern wages with
those of west German engineering workers from 1994, be maintained.
Mr Steinkuhler, who has been a key negotiator with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
the national negotiations on a 'solidarity pact' to help finance the
recovery of east Germany, rejected an offer of top-level talks with the
employers in the Gesamtmetall federation.
'Now is not the time for talking, it is the time for paying,' he said at the
union headquarters in Frankfurt yesterday. He rejected the 'horror stories'
of the employers of looming bankruptcy, and insisted that the eastern plants
could afford the pay rise.
State-by-state negotiations with the employers on new contracts in the five
east German Lander collapsed last month, and official arbitration failed to
break the deadlock.
The employers are offering a wage rise of no more than 9 per cent on April
1, to compensate for inflation. They are also seeking an extension of the
wage equalisation process over several years, to allow the eastern
enterprises time to become competitive.
They maintain that productivity in east German manufacturing industry is 70
per cent below that in west Germany, whereas engineering wages already stand
at 70 per cent of those in the west, and would rise to 82 per cent if the
full wage rise was paid.
Mr Dieter Kirchner, director of Gesamtmetall, said the employers' move to
cancel the contracts was an essential step to free companies, under the
direct threat of closure, from the excessive wage burden.
IG Metall, the largest and most influential trade union in Germany, says the
employers are seeking to break the wage contract system in the east, in
order to undermine collective bargaining in west Germany as well.
However local officials in the east admit that it may prove very difficult
to persuade their members to go on strike, if they fear their companies will
simply close as a result.

FT  10 MAR 93 / West German economy shrinks by 1%: Powerhouse of Europe
weakens markedly as recession fears grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Germany, the powerhouse of the European economy, saw a fall of 1 per
cent in gross domestic product in the last quarter of 1992, compared to the
previous quarter. The figures underlined 'recessive tendencies', the federal
statistics office said yesterday.
Conditions had worsened steadily following a relatively strong showing in
the first three months of last year, when mild weather helped gross domestic
product to grow by a seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent.
Excluding that anomaly, growth has now been shrinking since the summer of
1991, yesterday's figures showed.
While the fourth-quarter fall is less than the 1.5 per cent estimated by the
Bundesbank recently, it demonstrates that economic activity is weakening
markedly.
Independent economists now expect the economy to shrink by up to 2 per cent
this year.
The statistics office pointed out that capital investment in the quarter
under review had fallen by 4.6 per cent: the biggest drop since mid-1984.
Meanwhile, the number of people employed in the west had fallen, by 89,000,
for the first time in nine years.
A 2.5 per cent increase in domestic demand in the last three months of 1992
helped push imports up 4.7 per cent while exports rose by only 0.6 per cent,
the office added.
Meanwhile, investment in construction was 6.7 per cent higher due mainly to
continuing demand for housing.
Private consumption rose 1.8 per cent, partly under the influence of the
increase in value added tax on January 1, which spurred demand for consumer
durables.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Poland moves back on track with debt talks: Warsaw
negotiator smoothes ruffled feathers of banks - Anthony Robinson and
Christopher Bobinski review the chequered history of debt servicing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS for a reduction in Poland's Dollars 12.1bn (Pounds 8.5bn) debt
to foreign commercial banks are now expected to take on a new urgency
following International Monetary Fund approval this week of a Dollars 655m
stand-by credit.
An initial approach was made to foreign banks represented by the London Club
of bank creditors early in February after an 18-month hiatus. The Polish
team was led by Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, formerly Poland's main trade official
in Washington and recently appointed as Warsaw's debt negotiator. He defines
Poland's goals as 'a reasonable agreement on all aspects of our debt linked
to our real capacity to pay'.
The Dollars 12.1bn which Poland owes the banks is made up of capital and the
capitalised interest accumulated since Warsaw suspended debt service on all
but Dollars 1.1bn of revolving trade credits three years ago. The number of
bank creditors has fallen to around 300 from 460 ten years ago as many
smaller creditors have quietly sold off their Polish debt on the secondary
market. Some debt was also bought back illegally by Polish officials
implicated in the so-called Fozz scandal two years ago. Fozz is the Polish
acronym for the now-disbanded Polish debt office.
Poland continued to service its commercial bank debt for eight years after
suspending its much larger official debt to government agencies in March
1981. A decade of accumulating unpaid debt service pushed up the original
Dollars 20bn official debt to Dollars 33bn. But in March 1991 the Paris Club
of official creditors agreed a two stage, 50 per cent, debt reduction which
was conditional on Poland receiving IMF approval for its reform policies and
budgetary discipline.
The decision to suspend servicing most bank debt was taken partly on the
advice of US academic advisers shortly after the collapse of the communist
regime. The move angered the banks as did the decision to stop servicing the
Dollars 1.1bn revolving trade credit only days before talks resumed with
London Club representatives.
One of Mr Krowacki's first tasks at the resumed talks was to explain
Warsaw's decision. 'We had to place all the debt on the same basis so that
we could deal with it comprehensively,' he explained. But the unilateral
move to non-performing status only days before debt talks resumed was an
expensive blow for holders of the revolving credit.
Apart from smoothing the ruffled feathers of bank creditors, Mr Krowacki
also has to explain to his domestic audience why Poland needs to reach an
agreement on debts incurred under the communist regime. 'Few Poles realise
that we pay a hefty credit risk premium. The combination of a 4 per cent
premium and wider spreads is sometimes higher than the base interest rate
itself,' Mr Krowacki says.
Warsaw's poor credit rating is an important element in Poland's relative
lack of success in attracting private investment, which has been channelled
mainly into Hungary and the Czech Republic. Hungary, whose per capita
foreign debt is double the Polish level, received over 60 per cent of the
Dollars 7bn private capital which flowed into central Europe between
1990-92. Hungary's strong credit rating, sharply declining debt/export ratio
and rising reserves has widened its access to US and Japanese as well as
European capital markets and reduced the cost of borrowing.
At present Poland is paying only reduced interest on its Paris Club debt.
Next year it will have to pay full interest and in 1995 Warsaw will have to
resume capital repayment of around Dollars 2bn annually in addition to
between Dollars 500m and Dollars 600m in interest payments. A London Club
agreement would require additional repayments on the bank debt.
All this has serious budgetary implications for a country facing a sharply
rising domestic debt burden and the need to keep the budget deficit to
around 5 per cent of GDP. This is the main target outlined in Poland's
letter of intent to the IMF in connection with the latest standby loan.
Servicing foreign and domestic debt will consume 12 per cent of total budget
spending in fiscal 1993, according to Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the finance
minister. This will rise to around 25 per cent by 1995 if repayments under
both Paris and London Club agreements have to be financed.
This will require fresh money and refinancing of existing debt on a
substantial scale. Borrowing alone will not be enough. Poland also requires
further strong export growth and rising inflows of foreign equity capital.
Mr Osiatynski believes that measures will be required before long to boost
exports. 'I would prefer to do this through tax concessions to exporters
rather than by devaluation which feeds back quickly into inflation. But tax
concessions would erode revenue and bring us into conflict with the European
Community,' he says.
His words reflect the narrow margin of choice in a country which has
achieved an economic transformation in three years, but badly needs a
commercial debt agreement to facilitate investment on the scale required to
ensure steady growth.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Eni chief joins the corruption scandal list
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gabriele Cagliari, the chairman of Italy's Eni energy and chemicals state
holding company, has been arrested on charges of alleged corruption and
illegal funding of political parties. Separately, Mr Franco Ciatti, chairman
of Eni's Nuovo Pignone turbines and compressors subsidiary, was arrested on
corruption charges.
Mr Cagliari, head of Eni since 1989, was reported to have offered his
resignation last night. He is the most senior businessman to be detained by
Milan magistrates investigating contracts from the Enel state electricity
authority since a sweep of Enel's contractors began last month.
The arrests, in connection with contracts for gas turbines for Enel power
stations, had an immediate impact on the Milan stock exchange. Coupled with
growing uncertainty about the future of the government of Mr Giuliano Amato,
the Comit equity index fell by 17.11 points to 511.02, while the lira came
under heavy pressure, dropping to L965.38 against the D-Mark.
The involvement of Nuovo Pignone in the corruption investigations could
represent a blow to the government's ambitious privatisation programme, as
the company is one of the top candidates on the list of planned disposals.
Yesterday Nuovo Pignone's works council called on the government to suspend
the privatisation, citing the need for maximum transparency. The arrest of
Mr Cagliari could also set back plans at Eni, which hopes to float stakes in
its Agip petroleum and Snam gas distribution operations, as well as sell
smaller subsidiaries.
Mr Piero Barucci, the Treasury Minister, yesterday stressed the arrest would
not affect Eni's operations. Under changes pushed through by the government
last year, everyday responsibility for running the company had passed to its
managing director, Mr Franco Bernabe. In a statement, Eni said its board
would be meeting soon to consider the implication of Mr Cagliari's arrest.
Eni had already come under judicial scrutiny earlier this year, when Mr
Cagliari was informed by Rome magistrates that he could face prosecution.
The list of those arrested, and mostly released, includes Mr Giampiero
Pesenti, chairman of the Italmobiliare holding company which controls the
Franco Tosi engineering group, Mr Roberto Fochi, chairman of Filippo Fochi,
a listed engineering concern, and Mr Aldo Belleli, managing director of the
big Belleli plant building and engineering group.
According to leaked testimony, Mr Ciatti admitted to having paid L4bn
(Pounds 1.8m) in kickbacks.

FT  10 MAR 93 / France to push Serbsin Paris meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand of France will host talks in Paris tomorrow
between international mediators for a peace settlement in Bosnia and
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in an attempt to hasten an agreement
between the warring parties, it was announced in Paris yesterday.
The meeting, which will take place shortly before the scheduled resumption
of peace talks between the Bosnian Serbs, Moslems and Croats in New York,
was called at the request of the two mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord
Owen.
A statement issued by Mr Mitterrand's office said that the purpose of the
meeting would be to discuss in what way Serbia could help the peace process
in the former Yugoslavia and, in particular, how to persuade the Bosnian
Serbs to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan.
It is not the first time Mr Milosevic has been called upon to put pressure
on Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, at a difficult
moment in the peace process. It was thanks to the Serbian president's
arm-twisting in Geneva last January, that Mr Karadzic accepted the first
part of the Vance-Owen package, consisting of a constitutional framework for
Bosnia.
Ever since the talks moved from Geneva to New York at the beginning of
February it has appeared probable that the mediators, faced with the
intransigence of both the Bosnian Moslems and Serbs, would again call upon
President Milosevic at a crucial stage of the talks.
With the Moslem president of Bosnia, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, indicating that
he might soon sign the map of the 10 semi-autonomous provinces into which
Bosnia would be divided, the mediators have clearly decided that the moment
for putting pressure on the Bosnian Serbs has arrived.
If President Izetbegovic signs the map next week, perhaps after a number of
further small modifications, Mr Karadzic would be the only leader not to
have endorsed the last outstanding part of the peace package.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Danish premier sees Yes for Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR POUL Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, said last night he was
'quite optimistic' Danish voters would say Yes to the Maastricht treaty in
the country's referendum on May 18.
'Things are moving in the right direction,' Mr Rasmussen said after meeting
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, at 10 Downing Street.
Mr Rasmussen, the current European Community president, said he could not
exclude that Maastricht ratification would be held up further by Monday
night's House of Commons vote.
But he added: 'I look forward to ratification of the treaty from the UK
side, in the interest of Denmark and the rest of Europe.'
The new Danish referendum is made necessary by the country's No to the
treaty last June, which triggered a deal at the EC summit in Edinburgh in
December to make the Maastricht process palatable to the Danish people.
Mr Rasmussen, who took office in January, denied that the four crucial
exemptions from the treaty won by Denmark at Edinburgh now made the treaty a
charade. 'It's all about creating a more stable Europe.
'In some aspects, we say Denmark will not be there,' he added, referring to
the opt-outs, above all in the areas of monetary union and defence. 'This is
a positive basis for taking decisions on May 18.'
Backing up Mr Rasmussen's optimism, an opinion poll in Copenhagen yesterday
indicated 54 per cent of the electorate intended to vote Yes in the
referendum, with only 25 per cent planning to say No.
Mr Rasmussen said Denmark was determined to stand up to currency
speculators, in spite of its decision not to take part in the final stage of
economic and monetary union.
One of the reasons why Denmark withstood pressure for a devaluation of the
krone during the currency turbulence which occurred at the new year was
strengthened co-operation within the European monetary system.

THE pugnacious battle fought by Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist
leader, to avoid facing charges of alleged corruption suffered a serious
blow yesterday.
The special parliamentary commission dealing with magistrates' petitions for
waiving immunity yesterday decided there was sufficient grounds for Mr Craxi
to face the allegations on three counts. A final decision will be taken by
the full house; but in the past it has been rare for the recommendation of
the commission to be ignored.
The decision to waive his immunity is the first time parliament has decided
such an action in the case of a former party secretary. Immunity has already
been waived in the case of Mr Gianni de Michelis, the former foreign
minister and deputy Socialist leader, who is facing corruption charges over
alleged bribes linked to construction contracts in Venice.
Milan magistrates have sent a dossier to parliament listing more than 40
incidents in which Mr Craxi is alleged to have received illicit funds for
his party to the tune of L36bn (Pounds 16.4m). They asked parliament to
allow them to proceed with charges on separate counts of corruption, illicit
party funding and receiving stolen funds.
The Socialist members of the commission sought to limit the waiving of
immunity on the two lesser counts of corruption and illicit party funding.
But the commission accepted all three.
More than 50 deputies and senators have so far received notice they are
under investigation in Italy's wave of corruption scandals; and yesterday
two more were caught in the net, including Mr Francesco Cafarelli, the
Christian Democrat deputy who is currently secretary of parliament's
anti-Mafia commission. But at the beginning of this month documentation for
only 45 requests to have immunity waived to face corruption charges had been
received.
Mr Craxi was not present at yesterday's hearing but sent a letter repeating
earlier allegations that Milan magistrates were waging a deliberate campaign
to discredit him and the Socialist party.
Mr Craxi was first served notice he was under investigation for alleged
corruption on December 15. Since then he has received 11 other cautions.
Hearings have not covered investigations into the transfer of funds to a
Swiss bank account for the Socialist party by the late Mr Roberto Calvi,
head of Banco Ambrosiano.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Technician who put his company centre stage: Haig Simonian
profiles the man with a love for risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN

<TEXT>
MR Gabriele Cagliari, chairman of Italy's Eni state energy and chemicals
concern, has the look of a man more at home on an oil rig than in the
office.
However, it would be wrong to portray him merely as a burly technician.
Under his chairmanship Eni has pursued a high-profile sponsorship of Milan's
famous La Scala opera house. He regularly attends the opera's glitzy 'prima'
each December. Mr Cagliari, 62, is also a keen supporter of the Aspen
Institute's Italian branch, which organises regular conferences on
environmental issues, particularly related to energy and the Mediterranean.
An industrial engineering graduate of Milan's prestigious polytechnic, he
joined Eni in 1955, starting at the Houston, Texas, office of its Anic
subsidiary. He stayed with the group, then beginning its long challenge to
the international oil industry's dominant 'seven sisters', for the next 11
years. The period took him from the US back to Italy, where he moved to
Eni's Snamprogetti plant engineering subsidiary.
After a spell at Eurotecnica, an energy-related engineering group, Mr
Cagliari returned to Eni in 1981. Two years later he joined the group's
managing board, where he concentrated on the tormented restructuring of
Italy's chemicals sector. In 1989 he succeeded as chairman Mr Franco
Reviglio, the socialist university professor who is now minister of finance.
The choice of Mr Cagliari was in many ways obvious. Apart from his technical
background, he was one of relatively few senior Italian executives to have
had wide-ranging job experience abroad. He speaks good, if not perfect,
English.
Perhaps as important, he bore the right political stamp, having been closely
associated with the Socialist party, which has dominated Eni since its
creation. Recently, his political credentials have brought Mr Cagliari under
media scrutiny. Links have been traced between private family businesses and
those of Mr Silvano Larini, the playboy Socialist architect closely
associated with Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist party leader, who
gave himself up to Milan magistrates.
His arrest, and that of Mr Franco Ciatti, the chairman of Eni's Nuovo
Pignone subsidiary, is based entirely on his public business role rather
than any private activities.
Both men have been held on allegations of corruption and illegal political
funding in relation to Nuovo Pignone's contracts to supply gas turbines to
the Enel state electricity authority.
Nuovo Pignone, one of the prime candidates on the government's privatisation
list, is Italy's leading producer of gas turbines, compressors and other
high-technology engineering equipment. It is a leading supplier to Enel,
which has been concentrating on natural gas as an alternative energy source
since Italy decided to close down its nuclear power programme in the late
1980s. Gas had been taking an increasing role in national energy policy even
before the first oil price shock of 1973.
Although traditionally specialised in lower-capacity machines - a spin-off
from its expertise in compressors - Nuovo Pignone also produces the
high-powered turbines used in big power stations under licence from General
Electric of the US.
It is this activity for Enel which has now put Mr Cagliari and Mr Ciatti
behind bars.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Sweden urged to end bank crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN independent commission set up by the Swedish government has called for a
quicker resolution of the country's banking crisis and for further savings
of up to SKr70bn (Pounds 6.3bn) to help tackle the country's acute economic
difficulties.
The commission, led by economist Mr Assar Lindbeck, broadly supported the
country's current monetary policy, saying that too swift a lowering of
interest rates risked higher inflation and a further weakening of demand.
In a report published yesterday, it said: 'The central bank is advised to
continue its strategy of a gradual reduction in short-term interest rates,
provided there is no dramatic fall in the exchange rate or a dramatic
increase in long-term interest rates'.
The report was commissioned by Ms Anne Wibble, the finance minister, in
December to provide a blueprint for Swedish economic recovery in the wake of
the forced currency flotation last November.
Mr Lindbeck said top priority should be given to resolving the country's
banking crisis. He also suggested Sweden needed to save or raise a further
SKr60bn-70bn in the next five years in order to stabilise public debt at
40-50 per cent of GNP by 1998.
High long-term unemployment was the most serious threat facing Sweden, but
the country needed to get better value out of the SKr90bn allocated to
programmes for the jobless. He called for reduced benefits and a shift
towards less expensive training programmes.
In its list of 113 proposals, the commission also suggested increasing the
government's mandate period, cutting the number of MPs, strengthening the
budget process and reducing the influence of all types of interest groups.
The aim now will be to build consensus through wide-ranging discussions in
the coming weeks, with some of the proposals likely to be adopted in the
country's supplementary budget next month.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Italian premier retreats on corruption decree
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR GIULIANO AMATO, the Italian prime minister, yesterday withdrew plans to
deal leniently with those implicated in the country's widening corruption
scandals, staving off the immediate threat of a government crisis.
Share prices fell in Milan and the Bank of Italy was forced to intervene to
support the lira during a tense day which began with the arrests of two more
leading industrialists and was rife with rumours that Mr Amato was preparing
to resign.
A degree of calm later returned to the markets when the cabinet decided to
beat a humiliating retreat over its controversial plan to bring a
'political' solution to corruption scandals in which more than 1,000
politicians, businessmen and government officials have been implicated.
Before the decision, spokesmen for the two main partners in the fragile
four-party coalition, the Christian Democrats and Socialists, ruled out any
change of government and stressed their confidence in Mr Amato. The prime
minister himself had earlier met President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who also
rejected the idea of Mr Amato resigning.
Christian Democrat and Socialist leaders stressed the danger of bringing
down the government, with the almost inevitable consequence of early
elections.
Even the majority of opposition parties, though baying for the government's
blood, admitted they did not want elections before new laws are introduced
to modernise the system of proportional representation.
The climate of uncertainty was fuelled by news that Mr Gabriele Cagliari,
president of Eni, the state oil concern, had been arrested. Mr Cagliari,
head of Eni since 1989, was reported to have offered his resignation last
night. He was arrested with Mr Franco Ciatti, the president of Nuovo
Pignone, Eni's turbines subsidiary, on charges of alleged corruption
relating to power industry contracts.
The government's problems stemmed from a decision on Friday to introduce a
decree laying down new rules for controlling the financing of political
parties. Illicit funding of the parties through kickbacks on contracts has
emerged as the central element in the corruption scandals.
With the apparent backing of his four coalition partners, Mr Amato and Mr
Giovanni Conso, the new justice minister, decided to make illicit financing
of the parties no longer a criminal offence, and make the change
retroactive. Instead, it was to be treated as an administrative offence,
punished by fines, and judged by a government-appointed prefect.
Faced with an unexpected wave of popular protest, hostility from the
magistrates and vehement criticism from opposition parties, Mr Scalfaro
refused to sign the decree. He argued the timescale of the decree, which had
to be approved in its entirety or rejected within 60 days, conflicted with
the referendum on April 18 seeking to abolish public financing of political
parties.
The government yesterday accepted the president's arguments and went
further. The cabinet agreed to submit altered proposals for discussion as a
law in parliament and accepted the principle that illicit financing was a
criminal matter.
This keeps the matter within the control of the judiciary and answers the
main criticism of the magistrates involved in corruption cases - namely that
the previous decree would offer an easy exit for those implicated and would
effectively remove the bulk of the political corruption investigations from
their control.

FT  10 MAR 93 / CBI wants jobs to take priority over pay increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIAL STABILITY in Britain could be threatened if pay increases take
priority over jobs when recovery gets under way, according to Mr Howard
Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry.
Addressing a private meeting of senior industrialists earlier this week, Mr
Davies warned that an acceleration of wage increases, prompted by skill
shortages, could produce high inflation alongside high unemployment.
'In those circumstances, one has to have some concern about social
stability,' he said.
He also stressed the responsibility of employers in achieving a better
trade-off between pay and jobs.
'Employers have a key role to play, by seeking growth opportunities, not
just headcount reductions, and by investing in their workforces . . .
businesses can only afford to do that, and will only be able to expand their
markets, if they pay realistic increases.'
Mr Davies also criticised executive pay in the UK. 'The recent record on
senior management pay is not easy to defend in all companies,' he said. He
pointed to the fact that pay awards for directors and managers were lying
between 4 per cent and 6 per cent in the last half of 1992, compared with
2.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent for employees overall.
But he welcomed the general fall in the size of pay increases, now running
at below 3 per cent according to the CBI, and pointed out that unit labour
costs were increasing less in the UK than in other leading industrial
countries.
Mr Davies said, however, that UK labour costs were still not as competitive
as they needed to be and that real earnings for those in work had continued
to rise throughout the recession.
Pointing to the continued prominence of the inflation rate in wage
negotiations, he also said: 'I am left with an uneasy feeling that we may
have been here before, 10 years ago for example, and that we've let things
slip away before.'
Although Mr Davies criticised the uneven distribution of the 'pain of the
recession' and said a slower growth in living standards would have meant
fewer people out of work, he only tentatively welcomed workers' recent
agreement to trade off a pay cut against job security at Sheffield city
council.

GAMBRO, the Swedish medical equipment maker, said favourable market trends
and acquisitions had helped it lift 1992 pre-tax income to SKr753m (Dollars
102.34m), up 27 per cent from SKr594m a year earlier. The performance
encouraged the group to raise its dividend 20 per cent to SKr4.50 per share
from SKr3.75.
Sales rose 12 per cent to SKr6.3bn from SKr5.6bn. Operating profit rose 24
per cent to SKr972m, with interest expenses up to SKr299m from SKr283m.
Gambro's main activity, renal care, saw turnover rise 9 per cent to
SKr4.5bn, thanks to strong sales of dialysis machines and other equipment.
The intensive care and anaesthesia division lifted sales 17 per cent to
SKr408m, helped by the purchase of the UK group MIE, and the blood component
technology area increased sales by 18 per cent to SKr385m.

GAMBRO, the Swedish medical equipment maker, said favourable market trends
and acquisitions had helped it lift 1992 pre-tax income to SKr753m (Dollars
102.34m), up 27 per cent from SKr594m a year earlier.
The performance encouraged the group to raise its dividend 20 per cent to
SKr4.50 per share from SKr3.75.
The group said its European renal care activities contributed substantially
to the improvement, and it pointed to the favourable development of Cobe and
Hospal, two companies which it has purchased in the past five years.
Sales rose 12 per cent to SKr6.3bn from SKr5.6bn. Operating profit rose 24
per cent to SKr972m, with interest expenses up to SKr299m from SKr283m.
Gambro's main activity, renal care, saw turnover rise 9 per cent to
SKr4.5bn, thanks to strong sales of dialysis machines and other equipment.
But there were bigger increases from two of its other business areas. The
intensive care and anaesthesia division lifted sales 17 per cent to SKr408m,
helped by the purchase of the UK group MIE, and the blood component
technology area increased sales by 18 per cent to SKr385m.
Kymmene, the Finnish forestry group, is scrapping its dividend for the first
time in decades after posting a FM1.36bn (Dollars 225m) loss in 1992.
It blamed overcapacity, low prices and its product mix for the deficit,
which is bigger than its 1991 loss of FM1.3bn when it paid a FM0.90 per
share dividend. Sales rose to FM13.61bn from FM13.45bn, while operating
profit fell to FM394m from FM437m.
The group suffered from low capacity utilisation, aggravated by FM200m in
non-recurring restructuring costs and FM190m in foreign exchange losses. It
did not benefit significantly from the weakening markka because half its
paper is produced outside Finland.
The result was a FM530m reversal in the operating profit of the paper
divisions from a FM399m profit in 1991 to a FM131m loss last year.
Kymmene said it expected earnings to start improving gradually in 1993.

FT  09 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Vickers falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The return of speculation that engineering group Vickers will make a rights
issue when it announces figures tomorrow depressed the shares. At the day's
worst they were down 9 at 114p, with many market watchers increasingly
convinced that such a move was imminent. Later in the day, the strong market
trend helped to bring about a rally and the stock closed 4 off at 119p on
trade of 2.8m.
Mr Andy Chambers at Nomura said a rights issue from Vickers 'would not be
surprising, given the damage to the balance sheet wrought by the losses at
the Rolls-Royce subsidiary'. The range of losses forecast by analysts varies
between Pounds 12m and Pounds 25m.
Some slightly worrying figures on oil comsumption in OECD countries during
January failed to head off yet another good performance by the oil sector.
Shell managed an improvement of 4 at 578p in spite of a 'sell'
recommendation issued by NatWest Securities.
The exploration and production stocks continued to drive ahead strongly,
with Enterprise up 9 more to 497p and Lasmo 6 higher at 191p.
Confirmation that the Barclays chairman and chief executive Mr Andrew Buxton
is to pass on some of his responsibilities to a new senior executive later
this year, plus a growing feeling in the market that the shares have ridden
out the storm caused by the dividend cut, promoted a good rally yesterday.
The stock price was up and running from the outset, and shrugged off
attempted profit-taking and selling pressure to close the session a net 13
ahead at 421p - only 12 short of the level at which the shares were changing
hands before the dividend reduction. Turnover totalled 7m.
National Westminster also made strong progress and moved up 17 to 454p on
relatively thin turnover of 3.2m. Lloyds, viewed by many fund managers as
the safest bet in the sector, rose 7 to 559p on 5.5m traded.
A series of outstanding performances by Standard Chartered shares was dented
by worries about the bank's losses arising from the Bombay securities market
scandal last April. Standard Chartered is one of four big international
banks said to have been most actively involved in the Indian market.
Standard is scheduled to report preliminary figures tomorrow, with NatWest
Securities forecasting pre-tax profits of Pounds 280m, against Pounds 205m
last time. Standard shares settled 9 off at 699p after higher than usual
turnover of 1.6m.
Insurance broker Willis Corroon gained 7 at 194p, with dealers saying that
the shares now fully discount a cut in the dividend, due to be announced
tomorrow.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was said to have been behind the latest selling pressure
in the regional electricity companies. Midland, 10 down at 499p, and East
Midland, 8 1/2 lower at 456 1/2 p, were the poorest performers in the
sector.
Favourable results are expected from several of the large international
stocks this week. BAT Industries, which reports tomorrow, climbed 15 to
950p, while BTR, with results the following day, rose 6 to 590p.
Figures from British Vita, the foam manufacturer, proved disappointing and
the shares retreated amid a welter of downgrades to finish 18 weaker at
235p.
After its recent run, ICI ran into profit-taking and closed 5 adrift at
1240p. So did Thorn EMI, which slipped 10 to 864p.
A 19.3 per cent increase in figures at Fairey helped the shares put on 10 at
590p. General investment buying of Siebe saw the stock close 11 better at
499p. Also wanted, ahead of figures on Thursday, was TI Group, 6 up at 311p.
The strong market trend assisted Rolls-Royce in shrugging off worries about
the dividend, when it reports full year figures on Thursday. The shares
firmed 2 to 136p, with turnover of 4m recorded in the stock by the close.
Many analysts have suggested that the company is likely to halve the final
dividend, with the more pessimistic ones predicting a bigger reduction.
In motors, the recent news of an improvement in UK car sales continued to
boost Thomas Cowie, which added 9 at 225p.
Profit-taking restricted Associated British Food, 2 easier at 507p. The
stock has been recommended by brokers recently on the back of restructuring
in the bakery industry.
Buying in Amsterdam and continued US interest sustained Unilever's good
post-results run. The shares climbed 21 to 1238p.
Weekend press comment raked up further worries over the managerial changes
at Tate &amp; Lyle and the stock dipped 4 to 428p.
Relief over the results from Perkins Foods, together with some favourable
comments about the outlook for produce prices, lifted the shares 7 to 105p.
In a muted stores sector, Body Shop reacted to talk of devaluation benefits
and the shares added 10 at 185p.
Electronic components group Bowthorpe appreciated 6 to 294p, responding to
an aggressive buy note published by Hoare Govett, the stockbroking house.
Mr James Heal at Hoare said he expected Bowthorpe to move into a new 'niche'
business - electronic subsystems - which he forecasts could boost earnings
growth by 5 per cent over the next three years.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Scots administration plans to be launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURES TO improve the way Scotland is governed without conceding the
creation of a Scottish assembly or parliament - are to be unveiled this
afternoon by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary.
They include proposals to increase the scope of the Scottish grand
committee, which includes all 72 Scottish MPs,
to devolve more administrative powers from London to the Scottish Office.
The grand committee is likely to handle at least some sessions of Scottish
questions to the Scottish Office ministers and to debate non-contentious
Scottish legislation. The Scottish Office could take responsibility for
training from the Department of Employment.
Accompanying the package should be an announcement that some civil servants
dealing with the regulation of North Sea oil development in the Department
of Trade and Industry will move to Aberdeen.
The package, contained in a consultation paper, is certain to be attacked by
Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party. Even people
associated with the government concede that it may not win it many friends.
One observer said yesterday: 'If it isn't a nine-day wonder, it could
irritate people and throw petrol on dying embers.' Yet the widespread view
in Scotland is that the government will probably get away with it.
The package is the fulfilment of a statement by Mr John Major last February
that while ruling out any change to the union of Scotland and England, he
would 'take stock' after the election.
It was a sensible precaution because at that stage it seemed likely that
even if the Tories won the election they would lose many of their nine seats
in Scotland.
In the event the Tories took two seats in the election and raised their 24
per cent share of the Scottish vote by nearly two points.
The government is going ahead with the move partly because Mr Lang has made
conciliation and consultation the hallmarks of his administration since the
election, and partly because he believes he can outflank the opposition.
After the election a cross-party organisation called Scotland United was
formed to keep up the fight for constitutional change, but its
demonstrations soon fizzled out.
However, 25,000 people marched in Edinburgh during December's European
summit in support of 'democracy for Scotland'.
But efforts in the past few weeks by the leaders of the three anti-Tory
opposition parties to co-ordinate their opposition on the constitutional
question have so far failed, in spite of attempts by Mr Campbell Christie,
general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, to bring them
together.
Some Labour MPs have always been lukewarm about devolution, while the
Liberal Democrats believe their close association with Labour in the
Scottish constitutional convention before the election cost them votes.
Neither wants to become aligned with the SNP.
Mr Lang knows, however, that nothing he does will satisfy the
pro-devolutionists, or assuage the nationalists. But he believes his
proposals be enough to keep the constitutional issue off the boil.

FT  09 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Canada's air rivals slug it out on ground
 -A ruling is imminent on a crucial issue in the battle for supremacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A VICTOR is about to emerge from what could prove to be the decisive battle
in a three-year struggle between Canada's two main airlines, Air Canada and
Canadian Airlines International. But the battlefield is far removed from
normal measures of success or failure, such as operating costs or airport
slots.
The fight centres on the computer networks used by travel agents to book
seats and hotel rooms, and by the airlines themselves to manage their
inventory of seats.
The quasi-judicial Competition Tribunal in Ottawa concluded hearings last
week on an application by Canadian to break its management contract with the
Gemini Group, a computerised reservation system owned by Canadian, Air
Canada and Covia, a United Airlines subsidiary.
Canadian's survival depends on moving its business from Gemini to the rival
Sabre system, which is owned by AMR of Dallas, parent company of American
Airlines.
AMR wants to use Canadian as a guinea pig and a showpiece for building up
its business of providing management services to airlines, other transport
carriers and hotels. The fight over Gemini in Canada could thus be a taste
of things to come in other parts of the world as AMR and other large airline
management companies seek out new business.
The Dallas-based company has agreed to inject CDollars 246m (Pounds 137m) of
new equity into Canadian as part of a financial restructuring. But a
condition of the entire deal is that Canadian transfers management of its
internal reservations system (known as a 'hosting' contract) to Sabre. AMR
would provide not only a computerised reservations system but also a wide
range of accounting, catering, planning, flight analysis, and airport office
functions. It considers the sale of these services potentially more
lucrative than the 33 per cent equity stake it will acquire in Canadian.
Canadian, whose parent company, PWA Corp, has recorded losses of CDollars
720m in the past three years, says that it is doomed to bankruptcy without
the AMR investment.
The Americans have given the airline until the end of the year to withdraw
from Gemini and to fulfil two other conditions - the financial restructuring
and the necessary regulatory approvals. In the meantime,
Canadian will be kept alive by federal and provincial government loan
guarantees and equity contributions from its employees.
The application to withdraw from Gemini is supported by the Bureau for
Competition Policy, Ottawa's anti-trust watchdog, wanting to avoid one
airline ending up with a 90 per cent share of domestic scheduled traffic.
But Canadian's move is vigorously opposed by Gemini and the other two
shareholders, which have accused the airline of trying to push it into
bankruptcy.
The thrust of Air Canada and Covia's argument is that while an alliance
between Canadian Airlines and Sabre might keep competition alive in the
skies, it would create a near-monopoly on the ground. They contend that
Sabre would have a stranglehold on the computerised reservations market in
Canada. While it has a market share of only 30 per cent, compared with
Gemini's 65 per cent, loss of the Canadian Airlines hosting contract would
cut Gemini's revenues by a fifth. According to a Gemini briefing document,
the move would also result in a 'drastic reduction' in its share of the
computerised reservations market, especially in Canadian Airlines'
stronghold in western Canada.
However, these arguments are contested, not only by Canadian but by some of
Gemini's biggest customers. Mr Bill McGuire, president of the Alliance of
Canadian Travel Agents, said that improvements made to Gemini in 1991 had
given it much the same capability as Sabre. Most travel agents would be
reluctant to spend time and money learning a new system.
Gemini's future has also been cemented by its connections with Galileo
International, the reservations system in which both United Airlines and Air
Canada are shareholders, and which is Sabre's main rival in other parts of
the world.
The Competition Tribunal is widely expected to give the green light to
Canadian, perhaps with some conditions, thus prolonging the struggle between
Air Canada and Canadian for supremacy in the skies.
Mr Jack Lawless, a Canadian spokesman, says the carrier most likely to
survive in the longer term is the one 'who can bleed the longest'. Air
Canada is in a stronger financial position than Canadian, but the latter's
costs are 15 per cent lower and Mr Lawless says the services to be provided
by AMR will bring them down 'significantly'.
In the long run, Air Canada's opposition to Canadian's withdrawal from
Gemini may have less to do with survival of a computerised reservations
system than with the future shape of the Canadian airline industry.

<TEXT>
THE FINANCING arm of General Electric of the US is set to become the first
corporate borrower to tap the 'dragon bond' market, which is targeted at
non-Japanese investors in Asia.
General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC), which has a triple A rating,
intends to launch a US dollar-denominated fixed-rate offering by the end of
March.
Lehman Brothers has won the GECC mandate.
The dragon bond market has been pioneered by the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) to develop Asia's capital markets and to stimulate participation by
the region's investment banking community.
The ADB has launched two US dollar-denominated dragon bond issues since
1991.
It is expected to launch a yen-denominated issue in the near future.

<TEXT>
BLOCKBUSTER, the Florida-based video rental company which owns the
Cityvision chain in the UK and has been expanding into music retailing,
announced yesterday it was acquiring an 8.2 per cent stake in Spelling
Entertainment Group.
Spelling is an entertainment conglomerate built up by Mr Aaron Spelling, and
includes a library of television series, feature films, TV movies, and
mini-series.
The stake that Blockbuster is buying was previously owned by Cincinnati
financier Mr Carl Lindner's American Financial Corporation.
In exchange for the 24.5m ordinary shares of Spelling that Blockbuster is
acquiring, the Florida-based company will issue 7.6m shares of its own stock
to American Financial, together with warrants to acquire a total of 2m
Blockbuster shares at an exercise price of Dollars 25 a share.
Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman of Blockbuster, said the deal should help the
company to become 'a major force in the distribution and production of
filmed entertainment'.
There has been much debate about the long-term prospects for Blockbuster's
video rental business if new technologies allowed households to have
multiple movie channels on demand via a TV set.
Yesterday, Blockbuster shares gained Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 3/4 on the
news, while Spelling, which is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, was
unchanged at Dollars 6 7/8 .

FT  09 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cook's tender debated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WHITE knight duly arrived at the battle for Owners Abroad, taking the
shape of Thomas Cook, the German-owned travel agency group. But the stock
market's view was that Cook's tender move was 'too little, too late' to save
the UK's second largest tour operator from the Pounds 290m bid from
Airtours, its smaller rival. The tender offer is conditional on Airtours'
bid lapsing.
However, analysts reported that Cook's 150p a share cash tender offer for
12.5 per cent of the Owners equity had attracted some interest among
institutions.
Owners' management was reported to be following up what was described as a
'highly positive' meeting between analysts and Thomas Cook by holding
discussions with some of its larger shareholders.
Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court commented that if Owners and Thomas Cook
had presented yesterday's strategic plan and offer at the beginning of the
Airtours bid, then they would have been much better placed than now.
'As it is, it seems to be too little, too late and Airtours must be
favourite to win,' he said. Airtours shares jumped on news of the tender
offer, but faded to close steady at 327 1/2 p. Owners relinquished 3 to 141p
in turnover of 5.5m shares.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Thomas Cook backs alliance with Owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS Cook, the travel agency and financial service company, yesterday
backed its plans for a commercial alliance with Owners Abroad by making a
tender offer at 150p for up to 12.5 per cent of the UK holiday company.
The Pounds 29m cash offer is conditional on Owners Abroad's shareholders
rejecting the hostile all share offer and partial cash alternative from
Airtours, the rival tour company.
Mr Christopher Rodrigues, Thomas Cook chief executive, characterised the
offer as a substantial capital investment to support what was a 'quite
unique commercial alliance'. Owners Abroad and Thomas Cook say the
arrangement would allow Thomas Cook and LTU, the German tour operator - both
of which are controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank -
to create a substantial pan-European holiday company.
Airtours responded to the offer by saying it would neither extend its offer
beyond March 16 nor increase its final offers which last night valued Owners
Abroad at Pounds 285m.
Airtours' share price closed unchanged at 237.5p while Owners shares fell 3p
to 141p after heavy two-way trade.
Thomas Cook's emphasis on the commercial attractions of the alliance was
greeted as an unusual move at this stage in a bid.
Owners Abroad's directors and their trusts, which control 5.5 per cent of
the stock, will not be accepting the tender. Even so Owners shareholders
could therefore expect cash for only about 13.2 per cent of their holdings.
By comparison, Airtours is offering a partial cash alternative up to 56 per
cent of Owners shares, valuing the offer yesterday at 131p.
City observers' immediate reaction was that Thomas Cook had offered too
little too late in the bid.
Mr Rodrigues stressed that the tender offer had not been an attempt to
frustrate the Airtours bid but was an alternative for Owners shareholders
that would lead to substantial long-term commercial benefits.
Thomas Cook had decided it wanted to buy a share stake of about 10 per cent
in Owners Abroad and believed an investment of about Pounds 30m was the
correct allocation of capital to support its plans in the UK market.

FT  09 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours/Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The air was full of the hissing of deflated expectations after the
German-owned Thomas Cook unveiled the terms of its tender offer for 12 1/2
per cent of Owners Abroad. Having rejected Airtours' increased offer, the
onus was on Owners to come up with a far sweeter deal. But Thomas Cook's
continued reluctance to slap hard cash on the table will surely count
against it. For better or worse, British fund managers are more likely to be
seduced by short term financial gain than longer term industrial logic.
Owners' proposed alliance with Thomas Cook certainly has its commercial
attractions. It would furnish considerable cost savings, broaden Owners'
marketing appeal and open the door to other European markets. But the 150p
tender price represents only a small premium to Airtours' offer. Owners'
shareholders would worry about the value of their remaining holding slipping
without a bid premium. The company has hardly shown a slavish devotion to
investors' interests in the past.
Airtours' bid offers more elusive industrial rewards but more tangible
financial inducements. Given the wonders of UK accounting policies and the
timing of the bid, Airtours can write off Owners' winter losses while fully
benefiting from its summer profits. This will provide a substantial boost to
profitability this year. Airtours' share price is likely to move ahead
sharply on completion. The worries will only surface next year when any
integration difficulties materialise and the intentions of the traditionally
combative market leader, Thomson, become apparent.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Pits' power bills to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL is to pay 5 per cent more for its electricity from next month
at the same time as the coal it sells to electricity generators will fall
significantly in price.
British Coal's deals, concluded after negotiations with a variety of
electricity companies, would lead to its annual electricity bill of about
Pounds 100m rising by more than Pounds 5m if all its 50 pits stayed open.
Some of the corporation's executives are angry about the price rises because
they coincide with a 20 per cent reduction in the charges it makes to
generators for some coal.
Imported coal, used to generate electricity for large consumers, has also
been falling in price recently.
Disclosure of the deals will add to discontent over electricity tariffs
which are traditionally changed on April 1. Many other big users are facing
similar increases.
In addition domestic and small industrial customers have been promised
little, if any, reduction in electricity prices in spite of the reductions
in the price of coal. Most of the 12 regional electricity companies in
England and Wales that have announced tariffs have said that they are either
freezing prices or reducing them by 1 percentage point.
Further reductions are likely to be delayed until after the government has
published its white paper on coal, almost certainly after the Budget.
British Coal's deals are with Northern Electric, which will supply the
north-east pits, and PowerGen, which will supply other pits in England and
Wales.
PowerGen said yesterday that its contracts for next year were cheaper in
real terms than its existing deals with British Coal.
The company is, however, increasing its number of contracts with the
corporation and its new contracts are replacing cheaper deals with other
companies. Until now National Power, the other large generator in England
and Wales, was British Coal's other main supplier.
British Coal would not comment in detail yesterday on the electricity deals,
which it said had been conducted in confidence. One executive said, however,
it was diabolical that it had been forced to pay so much when it was having
to cut up to 30,000 jobs. 'How are we expected to bring our prices down to
world prices when one of our main costs is rising so steeply?'
The price increases will take the electricity bill of an average pit to
above the level paid before the privatisation of the electricity industry.
In the year immediately following privatisation British Coal won significant
reductions in prices, in common with many other large customers, as
electricity companies competed with each other for custom.
Since then electricity supply companies have sought to pull out of
low-margin or loss-making deals and prices have risen.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Govett advances 31% to Dollars 45.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVETT, the financial services company, increased its pre-tax profits by 31
per cent from Dollars 34.6m to Dollars 45.2m (Pounds 31.8m), in a year when
it altered its accounting practices to meet US standards.
The main effect of the change was on the group's US insurance subsidiary.
Instead of reporting earnings on an embedded value basis, which brings
forward a percentage of future profits into the current year, US standards
(GAAP) concentrate on cash flows. The result was to reduce stated 1991
profits by Dollars 12.5m.
The group decided to make the change following its issue of an American
Depositary Receipt Programme in the US and its plans to seek a quote on
Nasdaq, the US over-the-counter share market.
Despite the change, the insurance company was the engine of profits growth
in 1992, increasing profits from Dollars 4.8m to Dollars 19.1m. The group's
institutional and mutual fund management business also increased profits,
from Dollars 12.6m to Dollars 14.3m.
However, there were falls in profits from Dollars 6.5m to Dollars 6m at the
venture capital arm (because it completed fewer deals); and investment
income also fell, because of lower interest rates and a stagnant stock
market, from Dollars 14.1m to Dollars 9.8m. Funds under management grew
during the year from Dollars 5.2bn to Dollars 6bn.
The company's share price, 107p at the interim stage, has risen sharply to
close at 232p yesterday, helped by the revival of the dollar, a rerating of
the fund management sector and the higher profile of the group in the US.
Total net income for the year was Dollars 49.1m (Dollars 38m). After
corporate expenses of Dollars 3.9m (Dollars 3.4m), and tax of Dollars 11.2m
(Dollars 6m), profits were Dollars 34.1m (Dollars 28.6m). Fully diluted
earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 45 cents (36.1 cents).
The final dividend of 14.5 cents (13.5 cents) makes a total of 24 cents (22
cents).

Moorgate Smaller Companies Investment Trust is raising Pounds 25m via a
placing of 25m offer units at 100p each.
The units will be exchanged for shares at the trust's undiluted net asset
value on the latest date prior to the close of the offer. About 10m of the
units will be available for existing shareholders.
The trust believes that the outlook for smaller companies has changed
favourably in recent months as interest rates have fallen; the Hoare Govett
Smaller Companies Index has risen 11.4 per cent in the first two months of
the year, while the FT-A All-Share index rose only 2.4 per cent.
Moorgate Smaller Companies was launched in May 1991, with shares priced at
100p. Yesterday the shares closed at 123 1/2 p.

FT  09 MAR 93 / NTT shares soar on call rate hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) saw its share price surge by more than
10 per cent yesterday on comments made by a Posts and Telecommunications
official suggesting that the telecommunications group may be allowed to
increase rates charged for calls from public telephones.
Mr Futoshi Shirai, director general of the telecommunications bureau of the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said yesterday that it would be
easier for the ministry to accept an increase in public call-box charges as
these could be considered separately from other telephone rates.
The comments added to a recent surge of interest in NTT shares which has
lifted the issue's price by 28.5 per cent in the past eight trading days.
The issue has been actively pursued after NTT announced plans to propose
call charge increases to the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry.
Yesterday NTT closed Y75,000 higher at Y780,000 (Pounds 4,600).
Mr Shirai indicated that the ministry would consider favourably NTT's
planned application for the increase in call-box rates for two specific
reasons. First, unlike the situation in most other countries, public
call-box rates in Japan are the same as those charged for calls made from
the home.
Secondly, NTT has been covering the loss it makes on public telephone calls
with sales of telephone cards but this is expected to fall in the future as
the market for telephone cards becomes saturated.
The increase is likely to take the form of a shorter call time for each Y10
coin used.

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Besnier sells cheese unit to
banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BESNIER, the acquisitive French dairy group, has sold a 40 per cent stake in
Sofil, the company through which it controls the Caves du Roquefort cheese
concern, to three banks in a FFr700m capital-raising exercise.
Sofil was formed last autumn as the vehicle with which Besnier, already one
of the largest participants in the European cheese industry, bought a 57 per
cent stake in Roquefort for FFr862m (Dollars 153.38m) from Nestle, the Swiss
food group, following the latter's successful bid for Perrier mineral water.
The Sofil stake in Roquefort has since been raised to 69.5 per cent (with 55
per cent of the voting rights). Sofil has also bought an 8.1 per cent
holding in Bel, another leading French cheese producer, reportedly as a
precursor to taking a larger investment.
However, Besnier and Roquefort are heavily indebted. As a result, Besnier
has ceded 40 per cent of Sofil in equal shares to three French banks -
Credit Lyonnais, Banque Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale - in a
FFr700m to FFr800m capital increase.
The deal should alleviate the financial pressure on Besnier, a private
company run by Mr Michel Besnier, which expanded rapidly by acquisition in
the 1980s and was burdened by net debt of FFr2.5bn before the Roquefort
deal.
Besnier is trying to address the operational difficulties at Roquefort which
last month reported a net consolidated loss of FFr148m for 1992, against a
pre-tax profit of FFr37.28m in 1991.

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S A bit like selling the family silver, but Mr Dai of Beijing's
Friendship Store is quite unrepentant about the decision to sell off the
huge pair of bronze lions that adorn the entrance to this landmark on the
city's main boulevard.
'Everything in our store, whether decorations or retail items, is for sale,'
he said. 'We regard these lions as goods for sale.'
These once-proud creatures, who have observed impassively millions of
tourists and local Chinese passing through the store's portals, now carry a
price tag - the tag dangles from a rusty chain around the neck of one - of
Yn800,000 (Dollars 139,000) for the pair.
Mr Dai, deputy manager of the store, says negotiations are under way with a
wealthy overseas Chinese for the sale of the lions whose display would
attest to the worldly success of their owner.
Weighing eight tons, the lions are a copy of originals that guarded the
entrance to Beijing's Summer Palace, and are thus known as the 'Number Two
Pair Under Heaven'.
The lion's sale is merely one of many changes that have overtaken the
Friendship Store - the youyi shangdian - as it struggles to compete with
dazzling new emporiums sprouting all over Beijing in China's new age of
affluence. Recently, the management tore down the iron railing near the
store's entrance which had stood for many years as a barrier to locals who
came to gawk at the trickle of foreign tourists in the bleak 1970s.
A store manager was quoted as saying of the railing's removal: 'It's a
market economy now; we don't want to look like a big feudal government
office.'
Competition obliged the store last September to allow locals to shop there
in local currency. Previously it was the preserve of foreigners or
privileged Chinese who had access either to foreign money or to special
foreign exchange certificates.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Turks attack Kurdish bases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Turkish military was yesterday engaged in large-scale air and ground
attacks on bases of the Kurdish Workers' party (PKK) that have lasted at
least four days. It is the first government offensive since the beginning of
winter and a move clearly aimed at disrupting rebel attempts to exploit
upcoming Kurdish New Year celebrations on March 21.
The latest military operation, in which government forces claim to have
killed at least 50 PKK guerrillas near Mount Ararat on the Armenian border,
coincides with this week's vote in parliament to extend the emergency
administration for the 10 Kurdish-speaking provinces. Both the prime
minister, Mr Suleyman Demirel, and the military have recommended that
martial law, in place since July 1987, should remain for a further four
months.
The prime minister seems keen to distance himself from recent hardline
statements from the interior minister, Mr Ismet Sezgin, who warned that 'if
we wanted to, we could all bring them together and kill them and say they
had committed suicide'.
Nonetheless, with just two weeks to the New Year celebrations, there is
growing anxiety to avoid last year's violence in which more than 90
civilians were killed when the government used tanks and armoured vehicles
to reassert control in a string of towns along the border with Iraq and
Syria. The PKK was accused then of trying to turn the celebrations into a
separatist demonstration.
The prime minister has held meetings with Mr Ahmet Turk, chairman of the
People's Labour party, the nearest thing to an explicitly pro-Kurdish
political party.
A year on, the root causes of Kurdish discontent have still to be addressed.
Repressive policing methods, lack of confidence in the legal process,
together with the powerlessness of locals Kurds elected to parliament, have
sharpened local disillusion with the government in Ankara.
After the bloodiest year in the eight-year insurgency, with more than 2,000
people killed in 1992, the winter months have provided both sides with a
respite.
However, western diplomats believe the government has missed the opportunity
to use the breathing space to push on with its earlier promise of reform.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Magowan, head of Safeway, the Californian food retailer which was
the subject of Dollars 4.2bn leveraged buy-out in 1986, has asked to be
relieved of his job as chief executive.
Mr Magowan said he had made the request to the group's board of directors
because he wanted to devote more time to his role as managing general
partner and president of the San Francisco Giants baseball team. Mr Magowan,
who had been chief executive of Safeway for 13 years, will remain as
chairman of the group.
The board has appointed Mr Steve Burd, currently president of Safeway, to
the chief executive's post. Mr Burd, des-cribed as a long-time management
consultant to Safeway, became president in October.
Mr Magowan became involved with the San Francisco Giants last summer when he
was asked to join a group of investors seeking to buy the team and keep it
in California. He subsequently became managing general partner, and
yesterday said the position was proving 'more time-consuming than I
originally envisioned'.
In the 1980s, Mr Magowan stayed with Safeway through the KKR-led buy-out,
which was designed to see off a hostile takeover threat. The company came
back to the stock market, and has been paying down debt through various
refinancings.
However, its business - which takes in over 1,100 supermarkets in the US -
has been under pressure recently.

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Marriott set to sign deal with
bondholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARRIOTT Corporation, the US hotel and food services group, said yesterday
it was poised to sign an agreement with disgruntled bondholders.
Bondholders have been protesting at the company's plans to spin off its
hotel management operations into a separately-quoted entity, Marriott
International. One of the protesting groups is led by Chicago-based PPM
America, part of the Prudential insurance company of the UK.
It was unclear yesterday whether the agreement would resolve the dispute.
Marriott declined to say what the terms would be, but they are thought to
centre on improvements to the capital structure of the remaining Marriott
group, which will house the group's property assets and airport-tollroad
concessions.
Under the demerger plan, this company, which would be quoted, would be
renamed Host Marriott.
During the past few months, bondholders have split into two camps. One is a
group of large US institutions, thought to include The California Public
Employees Retirement System (Calpers) and the Teachers Insurance and Annuity
Association and represented by Goldman Sachs. The company's negotiations
have been with this group.
A second group is led by PPM America. These bondholders, who purchased new
Marriott debt securities last year, have already filed one lawsuit against
the company, and are threatening to expand the litigation.
Yesterday, Mr John Stark, general counsel for PPM America, said the
'litigating' bondholders were not 'specifically aware' of the proposed
settlement terms.
However, his general understanding was that the deal would not meet their
demands that credit quality and trading value of the bonds be fully
restored. If this was the case, he said, litigation would still be pursued.
Under the original 'demerger' plan, Host Marriott would have retained
virtually all Marriott Corporation's Dollars 3bn of long-term debt.
By separating out the financially healthy hotel management business, the
company hoped to accelerate its expansion, allowing it to take advantage of
an upturn in the economy unimpeded by the group's heavy debt burden.
Although Marriott shares rose on news of this scheme, bond prices dropped
sharply. Moody's, the Wall Street rating agency, downgraded Marriott bonds
from investment to non-investment grade.
The original scheme suggested Marriott International would provide a Dollars
600m credit facility to Host Marriott. During the lengthy negotiations with
the Goldman Sachs bondholders, there had been talk of expanding this,
perhaps to Dollars 900m. However, sources suggested yesterday the deal would
combine an enhanced credit facility with a reshuffling of some debt to
Marriott International.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Leyland Daf failed to file accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1991 accounts of Leyland Daf, the failed van and truckmaker, have not
been filed at Companies House and are now more than four months overdue, the
government said yesterday, David Owen writes.
Mr Neil Hamilton, a junior trade and industry minister, said the accounts
were due by the end of last October and that default procedures had been
initiated last year.
In a written answer to a question from Mr Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for
Great Grimsby, Mr Hamilton said that follow-up letters were issued on
November 16 and January 8.
The government had decided that further action against the directors would
be inappropriate as responsibility for the company's affairs now lay with
the administrative receiver appointed last month.
Meanwhile Leyland Daf dealers yesterday attacked a Pounds 250,000
advertising campaign that criticises the government's handling of the
company's financial crisis.
Posters and press advertisements calling for support in saving jobs at the
company have slogans including 'The government's too mean to buy a bunch of
Dafs'.
The dealers said the campaign - paid for by Leyland Daf Finance, one of the
operations to escape receivership - is 'misplaced and untimely' with
management buy-outs planned at the Birmingham and Leyland plants.

FT  09 MAR 93 / MP seeks switch on Scots verdicts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN to abolish Scotland's 'not proven' jury verdict is gaining
momentum, supporters said yesterday.
Mr George Robertson, a Labour MP, is to launch a private member's bill
seeking abolition, in the hope of focusing attention on the issue.
Campaigners say the verdict - an acquittal, but less emphatic than the 'not
guilty' verdict - is unfair both to the accused and to the families of
victims.
Mr Robertson, MP for Hamilton, said Scots law originally gave juries the
simple choice of 'proven' or 'not proven'. But one jury, anxious to
emphatically clear an accused man, declared him not guilty, and since then
three possible verdicts have been available.
A 1975 committee on criminal procedure headed by Lord Thompson agreed the
verdict should stay, although a minority of the committee disagreed.
Ironically, the Scottish verdict is now being studied by the Royal
Commission on criminal justice in England and Wales, and Scottish
authorities have said they will study its views on the subject.
Scotland's lord advocate, Lord Rodger, said last year in a letter to Mr
Robertson that while the case for a not proven verdict could be overstated,
there was 'some justification' for the argument that its availability
reduced the chances of a miscarriage of justice.
At present Scotland's juries of 15 people return verdicts by a simple
majority.
Mr Robertson said it was 'almost certain' that this would have to be
reviewed if the verdict were abolished.

</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council, including China, yesterday endorsed May
elections in Cambodia without the participation of Beijing's Khmer Rouge
allies, Reuter reports from the UN in New York.
In a unanimous resolution, the council threw its support behind
UN-supervised elections for a constituent assembly, scheduled for May 23-27,
the first democratic poll in the country's history.
Exclusion from the elections would bar the Khmer Rouge from a role in
governing the country, though no one is sure whether a deal might emerge
after UN forces leave.
The Khmer Rouge, one of four parties on Cambodia's Supreme National Council,
have violated a peace agreement signed in October 1991 which calls for the
demobilisation of forces and registration of eligible voters.
Western diplomats said it was the first time China had formally endorsed the
elections with the knowledge that time had run out for its Khmer Rouge
allies to participate in the poll.

The Bank of Japan quarterly survey of business confidence did not slow a
surge in the Tokyo stock market which rose by about 5 per cent to leave the
Nikkei average at 17,686 at the close, Charles Leadbeater writes.
The arrest of Mr Shin Kanemaru, formerly the ruling Liberal Democratic
party's chief power broker, on charges of tax evasion, also lifted the
market, which had been depressed for the past week partly because of rumours
of another political scandal.

FT  09 MAR 93 / LDP seeks to distance itself from Kanemaru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR SHIN KANEMARU, until last autumn the most powerful man in Japanese
politics, is to be detained in the Tokyo detention centre for 10 days for
questioning over alleged tax evasion involving Y1.2bn (Pounds 7m) bank
bonds.
The ruling Liberal Democratic party's leadership was yesterday struggling to
distance itself from the affair which threatens to embroil the government in
another damaging scandal.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and senior LDP officials have argued
that the tax evasion charges are a personal rather than a political issue.
The arrest has nevertheless led them to promise to pursue plans for the
reform of political funding and the electoral system.
Opposition parties plan to exploit the affair to embarrass the government,
which is only just recovering from the debilitating Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin
scandal.
They will allege that Mr Kanemaru's tax evasion was closely linked to his
political activities, in particular the financial backing he helped to
organise for Mr Noboru Takeshita, former prime minister.
Mr Kanemaru, who resigned from the Japanese parliament last October after
admitting receiving a Y500m illegal donation from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin, and
Mr Masahisa Haibara, his private secretary, are thought to hold about Y2.8bn
of discount bonds issued by the Nippon Credit Bank.
Such bonds do not have to be registered by name.
The tax authorities believe Mr Kanemaru and Mr Haibara bought some of the
bonds between 1987 and 1989 using about Y1.2bn of undeclared income.
The timing of the arrests was highly political.
The two men were arrested on Saturday evening, just hours after the Japanese
parliament's lower house had passed the budget for 1993.
The prospect of the arrests seemed to have accelerated agreement on the
budget after the LDP unexpectedly agreed to examine opposition proposals for
income tax cuts.
For their part, the prosecutors seem to have held off until the budget was
approved.
Had the arrests been made before the budget had been passed, the opposition
would have forced a delay in the budget process to debate Mr Kanemaru's
arrest.
Such a delay would have threatened to undermine confidence on the Tokyo
stock market.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday agreed to cut an additional Dollars 55bn
(Pounds 38.7bn) from his spending proposals after meeting budget experts
from the House of Representatives, the White House said, Reuter reports from
Washington.
During the meeting with members of the House budget committee at the White
House, Mr Clinton 'agreed to accept Dollars 55bn in additional cuts over
five years', said White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers.
She said the exact programmes that would be reduced were not yet determined.
The deeper reductions were necessary because of revised figures by the
Congressional Budget Office which showed that under Mr Clinton's proposals
his plan to reduce the deficit by Dollars 140bn would fall short of the
goal.

FT  09 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo trembles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market shuddered and dealers marked down Glaxo shares after an
article in the weekend press highlighted alleged violations of US drug laws
by the UK company regarding Zantac, its anti-ulcer drug.
In spite of claims by Glaxo that the allegations 'have been a matter of
public record since they appeared in the US and UK pharmaceutical trade
press last month', the shares were marked down to 631p by worried
marketmakers. The move was largely successful and only the most bearish
insti-tutions unloaded stock into what was clearly an unwilling market.
After the early setback, the share price marked time until the US market
opened. A flurry of American buying then lifted the stock to a London
closing level of 652p, a net decline of 8. Turnover of 11m was well above
usual.
UK drug industry specialists were surprised at the impact of the story. 'It
has been common knowledge that the US authorities have queried some claims,
but the market had largely discounted these worries,' said one analyst.
In another move, Glaxo said it had received approval from the Medicines
Control Agency in the UK to market its new inhaled steroid treatment for
asthma, called Flixotide.

FT  09 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOOD of confidence on the outlook for the UK economy took hold yesterday
in the derivatives market and led to a squeeze in the futures, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The first deal in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index was struck at
2,934, before a sell order saw it retreat to 2,928 in the first hour of
business. That cleared, the contract moved back into positive territory on
sporadic buying during the rest of the morning. Increased confidence over
the economy and talk of a further cut in UK base rates next week led to
strong buying in the afternoon.
Such was the demand that a squeeze developed in March and a large buying
order from a leading US house was said to have remained unfulfilled. Dealers
also reported a sizeable amount of basket trading.
March finished at the day's high of 2,973. This was a strong premium to the
underlying cash market and around 13 ahead of its fair value premium to cash
of around 2. Turnover, at 8,919, was reasonable.
In traded options, a large trade in computer and electronics group Amstrad,
said to have been carried out by Sheppards, made a significant contribution
to the day's total volume of 34,282 lots.
The total in Amstrad was 12,890, which was followed among the stock options
by Barclays, at 1,638 contracts. Some 7,669 lots were transacted in the
FT-SE 100 option.

FT  09 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: New peaks in confident stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALLING bond yields, reports of improving business confidence, and
expectations of a base rate cut in next week's Budget, touched off a burst
of optimism on the London stock market yesterday. The FT-SE 100 Index broke
through an important testing level to reach another closing high.
A final boost to UK shares came when Wall Street opened with a gain of 30
Dow points in early trading. London had earlier responded strongly to the
announcement that January had brought the largest rise in domestic consumer
credit since July 1991. Equity traders were cheered by indications from a
firmer UK government bond market that the credit figures had signalled
economic recovery without rekindling inflation fears.
However, the stock market was slow to make progress at first and the
upswing, when it came, owed much to a powerful squeeze in the stock index
futures sector which quickly translated into heavy basket trading between
futures and underlying equities. Sellers of the March future on the FT-SE
100 rushed to buy stock in an equity market where marketmakers could find no
shares on offer.
Until Wall Street opened, London was content to challenge the Footsie
testing area of around 2,950. But when New York, also after some hesitation,
advanced strongly, UK equities burst through to show a rise of more than 36
points on the FT-SE 100 Index, before settling at 2,957.3 for a gain on the
day of 35.2. Also at yet another all-time high was the FT-SE Mid 250 Index,
11.8 stronger at 3,119.7.
While expressing some caution over the quality of yesterday's advance,
equity strategists believed that the stock market is now likely to clear the
Footsie 3,000 mark in the near term. However, most expect to see
profit-takers appear above that level.
Some modest fiscal tightening, perhaps in the form of VAT taxes on food or
books, is expected when Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the
exchequer, delivers his Budget a week today. But the City of London is also
confident that the Budget season will also bring a further cut in UK
interest rates. Sterling's success in holding above DM2.40 yesterday
buttressed confidence that UK interest rates can be reduced, especially if
the Bundesbank eases rates further.
Optimism on economic recovery was encouraged by reports from the Institute
of Directors of increasing confidence in Britain's boardrooms, and inflation
worries checked by a prediction from the Confederation of British Industry
that manufacturing wage settlements are now running at below 2.5 per cent.
Trading volume was good but not outstandingly so, with the day's Seaq total
of 653.4m shares, of which about 64 per cent was in non-Footsie stocks,
comparing with 860.9m in the previous trading session; Friday's Seaq
turnover was worth Pounds 1.42bn at retail level.
Some strategists, urging caution, pointed to the potential shocks lurking
for the stock market on a company news front still smarting from last week's
decision by Barclays to cut the dividend.
Rights issue fears also continue to unsettle the stock market, with the
signs of renewed takeover interest increasing the chances that predators may
come to the equity sector for funding.

FT  09 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Strong bonds spur Dow to a
record peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices soared to record highs yesterday, helped by declining bond
yields, growing confidence about the economy and fresh inflows of cash into
equities, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the finish the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 64.84 at 3,469.42,
easily eclipsing the previous record close of 3,442.14 set on February 5. It
was the Dow's biggest one-day gain since last September. The more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 forged ahead 8.60 to 454.71, also an historic
high, while the American SE composite gained 2.93 at 416.73. The Nasdaq
composite was 5.86 stronger at 687.23, some way short of its best ever
close.
Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 277.9m shares, while rises
outpaced declines by a ratio of three-to-one.
Shares opened strongly, helped by news of big gains in foreign markets. Yet
it was the performance of US bonds that set equities alight. In spite of
last week's strong set of jobs data, which initially looked bad for bond
market sentiment, long-dated Treasury prices rose sharply early yesterday on
reports that President Clinton was planning new spending cuts for his
budget. The rise in prices pushed long yields down near historic lows.
This cheered equity investors, because lower interest rates help spur
economic growth and corporate profitability. Even when the bond price surge
lost steam later, stocks climbed further as cash continued to pour into the
market. With short-term interest rates and Treasury yields so low, investors
see equities as offering a better possible return on their money.
Among heavily traded cyclical stocks, Alcoa added Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars
72, General Electric put on Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 87 1/2 , Goodyear Tire
advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 74 1/4 and International Paper rose
Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 66 5/8 . Compaq jumped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 48
3/8 after announcing that it was cutting prices on a range of popular
products.
A rare decliner was Philip Morris, down a further Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars
63 1/2 in volume of more than 3.9m shares as investors continued to sell on
fears that the government will impose a heavy tax on cigarettes.
Charles Schwab moved forward Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 35 1/4 as investors
responded to last week's news that customer business at the discount broker
reached a record 40,000 trades a day in February.
Some leading Nasdaq market stocks were actively sought. Apple rose Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 56 1/2 , Intel Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 119 and MCI
Communications Dollars 1 to Dollars 42 1/2 .
Canada
THE Toronto market extended its current rally to a fifth day in heavy
dealings, given fresh impetus by the buoyancy in some leading foreign stock
exchanges yesterday.
The TSE 300 index appreciated 26.5 to close at 3,551.0 and advancing issues
outnumbered declines by 374 to 292. Volume came to 53m shares, but was well
below Friday's 72.2m.
Nine of the 14 sub-groups ended higher, led by mining, up 2.7 per cent.
Alcan rose CDollars 1 1/8 to CDollars 24. The gold shares index lost 1.9 per
cent as the New York bullion price eased.

SAO PAULO advanced 8.1 per cent in heavy trading, the Bovespa index
finishing 1,124 up at 14,974.
Trading was nervous after press reports on Sunday that Mr Paulo Haddad, the
former Brazilian economy minister, had planned a price freeze as a way to
stabilise the economy. Mr Eliseu Resende, Mr Haddad's successor, has said
that he might use elements of Mr Haddad's anti-inflation plan.

FT  09 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses produce limited
response to US vitality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES, even the late closing ones, had little time to respond to the
mid-morning access of vitality on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS saw the CAC 40 index rise 9.14 to 2,004.26, but dealers said business
was flat and dull as market turnover fell from FFr3.8bn to FFr2.6bn. Volume
in Suez, still the bourse's speculative lead, dropped considerably on the
day.
However, a selection of speculative feelers were put out in the advertising
and television business. Havas, the media and leisure group, rose FFr17.90
to FFr491.90 as gossip moved between the possibility of a share swap with
CEP Communications (which rose FFr9 to FFr424), or a merger with Canal Plus,
the television group. Canal Plus closed FFr22 higher at FFr1,380.
FRANKFURT shrugged off light early losses to end with the DAX 12.00 ahead at
1,694.82. Banks were mostly higher on interest rate hopes following the
Bundesbank's repo rate move last Friday, and chemicals were relatively weak
as the market waited for dividend cuts from the big three this week.
However, the main gains of the day covered a wide spectrum: Schering, in
pharmaceuticals, up DM11.50 to DM770, Volkswagen DM6.40 better at DM288.40,
Karstadt in retailers DM11 higher at DM794 and Linde, in engineering,
DM10.50 higher at DM799.50.
Schering, which has risen DM35 over the past three days, has been seeing
fund managers, said Mr Rod Hinkel at Hoare Govett, and its chickens may come
home to roost when it sees analysts, and produces DVFA earnings in just
under two weeks' time. Karstadt seems to have responded to some Kaufhof
sales figures and VW, the subject of analytical argument, has just attracted
a buy note from one broker.
BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 index close 7.66 higher at 1,227.85 on hopes for
lower European interest rates, a strong rise in the dollar and some
speculative buying.
Societe Generale de Belgique closed BFr100, or 4.5 per cent higher at
BFr2,345. Rumours included a raid on its parent company, Suez, stories that
Suez might want to sell its 61 per cent stake and talk of SGB selling parts
of its industrial portfolio, notably a stake in its non-ferrous metals
subsidiary unit, Union Miniere. Arbed, in which SGB has a 26 per cent stake,
closed BFr120, or 4.2 per cent better at BFr2,980.
AMSTERDAM was led ahead by a round of short-covering, particularly in
cyclicals, and the CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to 102.6. Philips was busy,
rising 50 cents to Fl 23.30, as domestic and foreign investors began to look
at the rest of this year, and 1994. Among cyclicals, DSM added Fl 3.40 to Fl
76.90 and Akzo put on Fl 3.30 to Fl 150.00.
The conglomerate, Begemann, shed Fl 1.50 to Fl 37.50 after two subsidiaries
took the market by surprise and sought protection from creditors. The
retailer, Ahold, added Fl 1.20 guilders to Fl 94.90 after
better-than-expected results from its 73 per cent owned subsidiary,
Schuitema, the wholesaler.
MILAN remained unfazed by the quickening pace of political developments and
the corruption scandal and it was, instead, technical considerations that
left shares lower after their strong showing last week.
The Comit index fell 7.34 to 528.13, reflecting declines in blue chip issues
ahead of the expiry later in the week of March options. Fiat settled down
L52 to L5,878 and Generali shed L550 to L36,900.
Shares of construction companies, however, went against the trend in
response to government measures announced over the weekend to unblock
contracts for public works, stalled for almost a year in corruption tangles.
The cement maker, Italcementi, gained L299 to settle at L11,117 while the
holding company, Italmobiliare, firmed L900 to L41,500. Mr Salvatore
Ligresti's Grassetto jumped L840 to settle at L6,900 while his Premafin
Finanziaria development company settled L550 higher at L6,000, amid
continuing speculation about an impending sale.
MADRID closed at a new high for the year, the general index rising 2.02 to
240.54 on the strong peseta, a jump in construction stocks and optimistic
inflation forecasts.
The construction sector was boosted by government plans to increase spending
on infrastructure, Ocisa leading with a Pta280, or 15 per cent rise to
Pta2,150. In contrast, the electrical utility, Iberdrola lost Pta16 to
Pta734 in 5.25m shares, accounting for 18.3 per cent of the total Pta21.2bn
turnover figure.
STOCKHOLM found support in demand for heavy engineering shares and the
Affarsvarlden index rose 7.06 to 1,039.0. The machine tool group, Sandvik,
saw its B shares add SKr10 to SKr475 in response to Friday's preliminary
1992 earnings report and favourable 1993 forecasts.
Volvo continued to gain ahead of its full-year figures due on Thursday.
Volvo's B shares were up SKr6 to SKr415 in continued heavy trading.
B shares in the medical equipment group, Gambro, rose SKr 2 to SKr338 after
it reported a 27 per cent rise in 1992 pre-tax profits.
OSLO climbed to a 1993 high in active trade, boosted by the central bank's
move, after the market closed on Friday, to cut its key overnight lending
rate by 25 basis points to 9.0 per cent. The all-share index rose 8.4 to
420.4 in turnover of NKr535m.

FT  09 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: European impetus for global equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe provided most of the impetus for global equities last week. But a 1.7
per cent gain, leaving the FT-Actuaries World Index up 0.4 per cent in local
currency terms, eventually owed little to the German interest rate prospects
which seemed to obsess bourses earlier in the week.
Friday's big event - a repo rate cut by the Bundesbank, after it refused to
alter the discount and Lombard rates on Thursday - had a negligible effect
in France and Germany, serving mainly to cheer up the UK market ahead of Mr
Norman Lamont's Budget statement a week today.
The big winners on the Continent were Finland and Italy. Both Helsinki and
Milan have had a good start to the year; both have seen devaluations and,
especially in the former, gains have come to more in local currency terms
than when measured in the dollar.
Devaluation has had its positive effects, notes Mr Peter Tron of Unibank in
London. Finland's strength, especially last week, reflected results from
cyclical industrial and forestry groups, with the devaluation effect
translated into reduced losses for 1992, and the prospect of positive
earnings for the current year.
Italy, meanwhile, has been accentuating the positive in somewhat similar
fashion, but with more obvious influences on the downside. The country's
growing corruption scandal, moving higher and higher up the political and
corporate hierarchies, seems to have been effectively discounted as
investors chose to concentrate on the cheaper lira and lower interest rates
which devaluation brought in its wake.
Also performing well last week was Mexico, retrieving some of its losses of
the week and, indeed, of the two months before. Commentators said that a
market destabilised by President Bill Clinton's equivocal commitment to the
North American Free Trade Agreement seemed to have decided that Mr Clinton
was solidly behind Nafta after all.

FT  09 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): NTT surge helps Nikkei
rise 5% to three-month high
</HEADLINE>

SHARE prices climbed 5.1 per cent to a three-month high as public funds
stepped up support to prevent a market slide after the arrest of Mr Shin
Kanemaru, former king-maker of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, was
announced last weekend, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 868.77 stronger at 17,686.47, the first time it has
closed above 17,500 since December 25 last year. The index opened at the
day's low of 16,855.62 and rose as high as 17,727.30.
Volume totalled 550m shares, the heaviest since last September. Advances
overwhelmed declines by 1,035 to 60, with 55 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks jumped 52.29 to 1,320.90 and, in London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed 1.74 up at 1,055.35.
Buying by public funds triggered a rally in the futures market, prompting
arbitrage purchases and a rush of short-covering.
Traders said the approval of the fiscal 1993 budget in the House of
Representatives last weekend, paving the way for the government to draw up
an additional economic stimulus package, also improved sentiment. 'We could
be seeing a new trading range for the market,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko
Securities.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y75,000, or 10.6 per cent, at
Y780,000. The issue had risen by 28.5 per cent over the previous eight
trading days on speculation that the next fiscal stimulus package will focus
on measures to upgrade the country's telecommunications infrastructure.
Officials at the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications are also likely to
approve a rate increase for city calls later this year. Traders noted heavy
trading by speculative dealers yesterday, but said a sustained rise above
the Y800,000 level would be unlikely.
Companies expected to benefit from a boost in telecommunications-linked
spending gained ground. NEC appreciated Y50 to Y711 and Fujikura, a cable
concern, Y15 to Y610.
Other export-oriented high-technology issues were higher on the stronger
dollar against the yen. Pioneer added Y170 at Y2,150 and TDK Y190 at Y3,210.
Aids-related stocks advanced on reports that Nippon Zeon and Ube Industries
were co-developing an anti-Aids drug. Nippon Zeon rose Y42 to Y572 and Ube
Y42 to Y360. Green Cross, a speculative favourite, climbed Y40 to Y1,250.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 643.43 at 18,484.28 in volume of 132.8m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, firmed Y280 to Y9,880.
Roundup
MANY OF the Pacific Rim markets displayed an easier trend.
HONG KONG took time to consolidate after last week's rise, but the market
remained underpinned by hopes that China and Britain will soon re-open talks
on the colony's future.
The Hang Seng index shed 20.65 to finish at 6,482.16 and turnover dipped
from HKDollars 4.69bn to HKDollars 3.3bn.
Blue chips were mostly lower, with utilities losing the most. However, HSBC
rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 69 on expectations of good annual results
being reported next week.
AUSTRALIA continued to be unsettled by Labor's gains in the latest opinion
polls and shares closed firmer but off their highs. The All Ordinaries index
finished 3.5 up at 1,617.1, after peaking at 1,620.3.
Turnover was a light 111.2m shares worth ADollars 189m, with overnight
trades of 3.4m News Corp shares and 2m Kolback shares contributing to the
volume. News Corp added 7 cents at ADollars 7.22 and Kolback put on 4 cents
at 37 cents.
SINGAPORE was dominated by speculative Malaysian shares traded over the
counter and the Straits Times Industrial index closed 3.67 higher at
1,661.04.
The first day of options trading made a slow start, with most investors,
unfamiliar with the new trading instrument, said to be reluctant to test it.
TAIWAN saw some early institutional demand for industrial stocks but the
mood turned negative as heavy profit-taking began among financial issues.
The weighted index finished 122.07, or 2.6 per cent, lower at 4,601.58 in
active turnover of TDollars 74.7bn.
KUALA LUMPUR saw some speculative buying but blue chips remained under
pressure. Falls in leading component stocks dragged the composite index down
0.41 to 637.93.
SEOUL reversed nine consecutive days of declines and the composite index
rebounded 19.69 to 625.62.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: EMS currencies stronger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark continued to come under pressure yesterday, weakened by
expectations of further German rate cuts, writes Emma Tucker.
The fall in the currency followed the Bundesbank's decision to lower the
interest rate on its 14-day repo on Friday. This enabled other European
Monetary System currencies to maintain stronger positions, with the French
franc, peseta, lira and pound benefiting in particular.
Profit-taking on the dollar was the other main feature of foreign exchange
trading in Europe yesterday. After the ebullience that greeted Friday's
excellent US non-farm payroll figures, the dollar eased slightly as
investors calmed down ahead of this week's economic data, expected to
reflect more modest growth.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in London,
said: 'The market is coming back to reality. Although there are genuine
signs that the US economy is growing, there has been nothing else in terms
of data so far to suggest that it is growing at the rate indicated by last
week's payroll figures.'
Although underlying sentiment towards the US currency remains bullish, it
closed about  1/2 pfennig down in London at DM1.6625. It rallied slightly in
New York to end at DM1.6635.
Among EMS currencies, the Spanish peseta advanced steadily against the
D-Mark. Dealers said widespread expectations of a cut in Germany's
officially posted rates on March 18 was helping to calm fears that the Bank
of Spain would be forced to prop up the peseta at current levels. It
finished at Pta71.08 to the D-Mark, compared with Friday's close of
Pta71.37.
Sterling was mildly weaker than on Friday, but managed to stay above DM2.40
for most of the day. Mr Hawkins commented that encouraging credit business
figures helped the pound maintain its level.
'A lot of the talk about the UK recovery has been anecdotal. At the moment
the rise in credit is one of the few hard pieces of data suggesting that the
upturn in demand is sustainable,' he said.
According to analysts, reservations about sterling still abound, but they
are mainly political. There was some nervousness yesterday about a possible
government defeat over Maastricht. However, sentiment is generally more
favourable. Analysts at Bank of America are forecasting a rise in the pound
to DM2.60 towards the end of the year.
The yen was expected to weaken yesterday after the latest Bank of Japan
tankan survey showed corporate confidence to be very gloomy. But dealers
reported a big move back into the Japanese currency in the afternoon.
One commented that although the domestic fundamentals behind the yen looked
poor, the market was focusing on Japan's strong trade surplus. The yen ended
in London at Y116.6 per dollar, having risen from Friday's Y117.6.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Bank forecasts surplus
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERNIGHT lending rates in the UK money markets dropped to 4 per cent
yesterday morning, after the Bank of England forecast a cash surplus of
Pounds 100m.
The Bank said this was the first time it had forecast a surplus for almost
three years. The last time that it needed to smooth out the imbalance
between the government's accounts and the private sec-tor by selling
Treasury bills into the market was in April 1990.
According to the Bank, there were no special circumstances behind the
surplus. On most days more money flows from the commercial banks to the
government than vice versa, so the banks' holdings of liquid assets are run
down and the money market finds itself with a shortage of funds which the
Bank then relieves.
All that happened yesterday was that more money flowed from the government
to the commercial banks so the Bank had to drain the system of excess
liquidity, in order to maintain control over short-term lending rates.
Money market dealers reported that, although money was easy as a result of
the surplus, longer dated rates were scarcely affected.
One-week money rates declined to around 5 1/2 per cent from Friday's 6 1/8
per cent, while one-month money softened to around 6 per cent on the offered
side from 6 3/16 per cent.
The key three-month inter-bank rate, seen as a good guide to base rate
trends, fell to 5 15/16 per cent on the offered side, from 6 1/16 per cent.
In the afternoon the Bank revised the surplus to Pounds 200m. It then sold
the market Pounds 200m of Treasury bills, due on March 12, at 5 3/8 to 5
9/16 per cent.
Dealing in short-sterling futures was quiet. The June contract moved within
a narrow range and finished virtually unchanged on the day at 94.60.
In France there was more activity. The June French franc contract rose by
more than 20 basis points, buoyed by a stronger franc. The market believes
that with a firmer franc the French authorities will be able to lower their
short-term interest rates in the near future. The June contract was finally
around 91.63, following an opening level of 91.41.
Three-month interbank rates in France were sharply lower yesterday. They
were quoted at 10 31/32 per cent, compared with 11 1/2 per cent on Friday.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally amid hopes of US spending
curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER Friday's interruption, longer-dated US Treasury prices resumed their
rally yesterday after sentiment was boosted by reports that President Bill
Clinton is planning more spending cuts than he originally announced in his
first budget. Late profit-taking, however, wiped out more than half of the
market's early gains.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/16 at 105
3/16 , yielding 6.715 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was lower, down  1/8 at 99 27/32 , to yield 3.944 per cent.
Although prices fell sharply on Friday morning following a much
stronger-than-expected February employment report, by the end of the day
they had regained much of their lost ground, an indication of the resilience
of market sentiment.
It was no surprise, therefore, when bonds opened strongly yesterday. Dealers
attributed the buying to weekend press and television reports suggesting
that the White House is considering bowing to the wishes of Congressional
Democrats and adding new spending cuts to its budget plans. The reports
bolstered investors' belief that President Clinton has the courage and
political support to take a tough anti-deficit policy stance.
Prices were also helped by a continued shifting of funds into Treasuries by
holders of mortgage-backed securities, and by comments from Mr Roger Altman,
the deputy treasury secretary and key economic adviser to the president, who
said that the government should be wary about 'going overboard' with its
planned economic stimulus, given the latest jobs data.
Later in the day, however, the long end gave back some of its gains as
dealers and investors took the opportunity to book some profits.
THE higher-yielding European government bond markets showed further strong
gains yesterday, continuing the outperformance seen since the Bundesbank's
announcement on Friday that its key money market rate was to be cut by a
quarter of a point.
Spanish and Danish bonds have led the rally, as pressure within the European
exchange rate mechanism has eased. Ten-year Danish bond yields stood 185
basis points above those on German government bond before the Bundesbank's
announcement; by yesterday evening, they had narrowed sharply to 155 basis
points.
'People are looking for the right time to move out of bunds and into markets
like Spain and Denmark,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, an analyst at Warburg
Securities in London. However, Mr Richard Gray, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said
the rally was more likely to reflect a shift by fund managers out of cash.
Friday's US employment report and Bundesbank announcement had provided the
latest signal for fund managers to move into bonds or equities, he said.
German government bonds remained subdued after Friday's rally, with the
yield on 10-year bonds remaining at around 6.5 per cent.
UK government bonds rose across the yield curve again yesterday as sterling
remained firm. The best gains were seen at longer maturities, leading to a
further flat-tening of the UK yield curve.
The recent bounce in sterling was reported to have encouraged greater buying
by foreign investors. In the first 10 months of this financial year,
foreigners had bought only a net Pounds 500m of gilts, according to UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.
The continuing rally prompted the Bank of England to issue a further three
tranches of gilts totalling Pounds 700m, after last week's Pounds 1bn.
The bonds issued are: Pounds 100m 6 3/4 per cent gilts due 1995/98, Pounds
300 of 9 per cent gilts due 2000 and Pounds 300m of 9 1/2 per cent gilts due
2004.

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Feast of new issues digested on
prospect of rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED optimism among investors that interest rates are set to fall
further across Europe enabled the international bond market to digest
yesterday's large supply of new issues.
The Kingdom of Sweden returned to the market for the first time since its
Dollars 2bn global offering in February with a zero-coupon Eurobond issue
denominated in French francs. Good demand enabled the borrower to increase
the amount to FFr4bn from an original FFr3bn, and fanned hopes that some
more zero-coupon bonds would be issued this week.
Sweden's 10-year bonds were priced at 48.65 to yield 24 basis points over
the French government's 8 1/2 per cent OATs due 2003. When the bonds were
freed to trade, the yield spread tightened to 22 basis points, but later
widened back to 24 basis points when the additional FFr1bn was launched.
An official at the lead manager, Paribas, said retail demand for the bonds
was strong, especially in Germany, Switzerland and the Benelux countries. UK
institutions were also interested. The official said that, by contrast,
French investors did not show much interest, mainly because they did not
accord to sovereign borrowers the reception they gave to domestic issuers of
zero-coupon bonds.
Rarity value added to the attraction of the Dollars 300m, seven-year
Eurobond issue with equity warrants launched by Veba, the large German
utility.
Syndicate managers said that Veba was one of the few remaining German
companies which still had authorisation from its shareholders to raise
equity-linked financing without offering shareholders pre-emptive rights. In
recent years, German companies have been discouraged from seeking further
authorisations at annual meetings due to growing shareholder opposition.
Demand for Veba's issue was such that the price of the bonds rose as high as
119 1/2 from an issue price of 116 1/2 , but were later bid at 117 1/2 . The
ex-warrant bonds closed at 99.55 bid, while the warrants traded around DM55.
The Eurosterling sector was tapped again in the morning by Carlsberg Finance
AS, a subsidiary of the Danish brewing group, which raised Pounds 100m worth
of five-year Eurobonds. Later, Halifax Building Society launched a Pounds
150m partly-paid seven-year Eurobond issue. The syndicate on the Halifax
issue had not broken by the close of business.
Carlsberg's bonds, which carry a 7 1/4 per cent coupon, were priced to yield
7.31 per cent, or 68 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent UK government bond
due 1998. When the bonds were freed to trade by late morning, the spread
narrowed to 63 basis points, reflecting continued demand from UK and
continental institutions for sterling-denominated corporate paper.
The Czech National Bank's Dollars 300m three-year Eurobond issue, launched
last week, was priced to yield 272 basis points over US Treasuries, at the
lower end of the indicated range of 272-278 basis points.
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday affirmed the long-term
rating of British Airways at A2. It had earlier put the rating under review
for a possible downgrade.

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Terms fixed for special issue
to cover Efim debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE dispute between the Italian authorities and foreign bank creditors of
Efim, the state holding company which went into voluntary liquidation last
July, moved closer to resolution yesterday as the terms were fixed for the
special government bonds to be issued to repay creditors.
However, there was growing concern among the group's bank creditors that the
European Commission might yet derail the agreement. Representatives on the
steering group set up last year to co-ordinate foreign banks' negotiations
with the Italian authorities said they believed the EC was querying whether
government support in repayment of Efim creditors involved unfair state aid.
'That could put the whole thing back several months,' one US banker said.
The details of the bonds to be issued remove some of the continuing
uncertainties regarding the group's borrowings, which are believed to have
reached L17,500bn, including trade creditors. Interest on the special bonds,
which will have a five-year maturity, will be paid at 50 basis points above
six-month RIBOR (Rome Interbank Offered Rate). The new bonds will be issued
from April 1 and pay interest six-monthly in arrears.
However, doubts remain as to whether the terms will satisfy bank creditors,
some of which have been threatening legal action.
The main issue still to be resolved concerns the treatment of accrued
interest on Efim's debts since it was put into liquidation last July.
Negotiations are also still continuing on how to treat debts of Efim
subsidiaries which are not 100 per cent owned by the parent company.
There was also uncertainty yesterday about whether Efim's foreign bank
creditors would receive the new Lira bonds, or whether they would be paid in
cash raised from the sale of the bonds. Bankers in London said that they had
reached agreement with the Italian authorities to be repaid in cash.
Late last year, Mr Alberto Predieri, the liquidator, said the L9,000bn
offered by the government was insufficient, since accumulated interest
payments had raised the sum required to about L10,000bn.
Bank creditors had threatened last month to block parts of the government's
liquidiation plan as a way of putting pressure on the authorities to have
their debts repaid.

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: De Beers steps through dividend
minefield - Philip Gawith previews the South African diamond group's 1992
results out today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the board of De Beers, the South African group which dominates the
world diamond market, gathers in Kimberley today to consider the 1992
financial results and dividend, it will be the focus of unprecedented
attention.
A terse announcement seven months ago - 'The directors advise that the
current outlook indicates a significant reduction in the final dividends' -
sent the De Beers share price and Johannesburg Stock Exchange into a
tailspin. It also unleashed an avalanche of unfavourable publicity on the
company.
At the time, the air was thick with accusations that De Beers was either
misreading or misleading the market. Many analysts were left with egg on
their faces and investors with heavy losses.
Since then, sentiment towards the company has improved, but it remains very
skittish. De Beers' shares, for example, plunged nearly 7 per cent on
Wednesday last week to R62.75, before recovering slightly.
The key question today is by how much De Beers will cut the dividend -
something it has done only once before. Most analysts are forecasting a cut
of between 30 and 40 per cent, from 112 US cents a share in 1991. But some
forecasters estimate the cut could be as high as 50 per cent.
Apart from De Beers' August dividend announcement, which effectively compels
it to cut the dividend, a reduction is a financial necessity. Dividend cover
has fallen over the past four years to a level where there is very little
leeway to hold the dividend if earnings fall - as they are sure to do.
Investors and brokers will also anxiously scrutinise De Beers's balance
sheet to ascertain how much it has spent mopping up the excess diamond
supply that had bypassed the Central Selling Organisation (CSO), the De
Beers controlled company that sells 80 per cent of the world's rough
diamonds.
At the same time as the dividend announcement, De Beers imposed quotas which
reduced the amount of diamonds the CSO would buy from producers by 25 per
cent. This wrong-footed most brokers, and there is now considerable
nervousness about what De Beers will decide to do next.
This partly reflects the high risk of forecasting errors. The secrecy and
complexity of the industry mean analysts are dealing with imperfect
information. But it is also a function of confusing market signals.
Despite the US recovery, the weak state of other world economies, especially
Japan's, ought to be bad news for the sale of luxury items like diamonds.
News, however, from 1993's first two rough diamond auctions - known as
'sights' - tells a different tale. Trade estimates suggest the two sights
were worth a total of about Dollars 850m, nearly 50 per cent more than the
estimated Dollars 580m for the comparable auctions in 1992.
Analysts resolve this anomaly by arguing that the pick-up in sales is
artificial. De Beers, they say, last year limited supply so much that it
caused a shortage which led to a firming of prices and larger sights. Higher
sales, however, do not reflect the underlying reality that production far
outstrips demand.
One possibility is that the good sights, together with the CSO's recent 1.5
per cent rise in the prices it pays for rough diamonds, show that De Beers
is trying to soften the blow of lower earnings. Whatever the outlook for CSO
sales in 1993 - most analysts seem to think they will rise marginally to
Dollars 3.6bn from Dollars 3.4bn in 1992 - the improved state of rough
diamond sights will have no bearing on De Beers results to be announced
today.
These will certainly show a considerable fall in earnings, in large part due
to its decision, effective from September, to impose quotas on producers.
This obviously affects all De Beers's own mines - in South Africa, Namibia
and Botswana. Analysts are predicting that earnings per share, including
retained profits from associates, will fall by 20 to 30 per cent from 283 US
cents in 1991.
There is little prospect of the CSO quotas being scrapped, since the gap
between production contracted to the company, probably about Dollars 5bn,
and actual CSO sales, remains considerable.
There is broad agreement among analysts that by imposing quotas, by mopping
up rough stones outside the CSO and by keeping sights tight, De Beers has
done a good job in performing its traditional role of maintaining order in
the market.
Mr Kevin Kartun, analyst at stockbroker Frankel Pollak Vinderine, notes:
'Once more the De Beers/CSO arrangement has restored stability . . . I don't
think anyone else could have done it.'
Mr Des Kilalea, analyst at broker Martin &amp; Co, endorses this view. 'I think
they've done their job. The doomsday scenarios one was hearing about are a
lot more distant now.' He adds, however, that De Beers is not yet out of the
woods.
Two problems held back De Beers last year: weaker-than-anticipated demand,
as world economies failed to pick up; and increased supply as a flood of
diamonds emerged from Angola. On the first count, the pick-up in the US
economy is not sufficient to offset the anaemic performance of Europe and
the increasingly fragile Japanese economy.
And, while floods and renewed hostilities in Angola have dampened supplies
that from country, Mr Kilalea comments: 'It is not a problem that has been
cured. It is one that has been shelved.'

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bank of Tokyo will upgrade
Taiwan office to branch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AFTER months of negotiations with Beijing, the Bank of Tokyo, the Japanese
foreign exchange bank, yesterday announced that its representative office in
Taipei would be upgraded to branch status.
This follows a painstaking approval process by the Chinese government, which
is sensitive about dealings with Taiwan. The Bank of Tokyo has been wary of
irritating the Chinese government, which punished the bank in 1990 when it
announced plans to open a Taipei representative office by delaying a planned
financial joint venture in Shanghai and suggesting other opportunities in
the mainland market would be denied.
Beijing later forgave the bank but Japanese financial institutions have
since been discreet in dealings with Taiwanese authorities. Bank of Tokyo's
Taipei branch plans to start banking and foreign ex-change operations on
March 27.

AFTER months of negotiations with Beijing, the Bank of Tokyo, the Japanese
foreign exchange bank, yesterday finally announced its representative office
in Taipei would be upgraded to branch status.
This follows a painstaking approval process by the Chinese government, which
is sensitive about dealings with Taiwan. Last month, the Bank of Tokyo
denied an announcement by the Taiwanese government that the bank had won
approval to open a branch in Taipei. The Bank of Tokyo has been wary of
irritating the Chinese government, which punished the bank in 1990 when it
announced plans to open a Taipei representative office by delaying a planned
financial joint venture in Shanghai and suggesting other opportunities in
the mainland market would be denied.
After governmental talks, Beijing forgave the bank but, ever since, Japanese
financial institutions have been discreet in dealings with Taiwanese
authorities. Bank of Tokyo's Taipei branch plans to start banking and
foreign exchange operations on March 27, becoming the first Japanese bank to
open a branch since Japan severed ties with Taiwan in 1972.
It will be the second Japanese bank to have a branch in Taiwan after
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, which opened its Taipei operations in 1959.
Bank of Tokyo, is to donate Dollars 250,000 of its loan portfolio to the
Filipino government in a 'debt-for-child development' swap to assist a child
education project in the Philippines. The debt donation will be channelled
through Unicef Japan, and is the first ever of its kind. Japanese banks have
started to write-off loans to developing countries through debt swap
arrangements.
Last year, BoT and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank arranged 'debt-for-nature' swaps,
donating its loans to assist environmental conservation projects.
Until recently, Japanese banks were reluctant to participate in such
programmes.

Dollars 1bn acquisitions

<TEXT>
INDOCEMENT, Indonesia's dominant cement producer and largest listed company,
yesterday announced a 6 per cent rise in net profits to Rp327.4bn (Dollars
180m) in the first results following nearly Dollars 1bn in food and property
acquisitions last July.
The results were in line with brokers' estimates and include 12-month
operating figures from Indofood, in which Indocement acquired a 51 per cent
stake, and five-month operating results from Bogasari Flour Mills and the
Wisma Indocement office tower.
Brokers estimate Indofood contributed about Rp58bn to net profits, which may
appease some minority shareholders who considered the Rp777bn purchase price
as too high. Until last July, all the acquisitions were privately-owned by
the Salim group, Indocement's principal shareholder.
The purchases included Rp719bn in goodwill, and brokers say a similar amount
has now been booked as an asset in Indocement's accounts. 'It seems a very
generous figure given the market's reservations over the acquisitions,'
noted one foreign broker.
Brokers expect Indofood to be floated by the end of next year, with
Indocement possibly reducing its stake to lower debt, which increased to
Rp2,974bn last year from Rp634bn in 1991.
There was a corresponding rise in the company's debt-to-equity gearing from
11 per cent to 143 per cent in 1992. Cash and time deposits dropped from
Rp409bn to Rp120bn and net interest income moved from a Rp44bn gain in 1991
to a Rp120bn loss.
Net revenues rose from Rp771bn to Rp2,137bn and the company's operating
profit increased from Rp310bn to Rp562bn year-on-year. Earnings per share
were raised from Rp515 to Rp547.
Brokers expect improved prospects for the cement operations in 1993
following a recent rise in the government-controlled price of cement.

The interim dividend has been reduced to 4 cents a share from 5.3 cents, but
the previous corresponding period covered seven months.
Mr EA Harris, chairman, said: 'Directors do not expect trading conditions to
improve significantly over the remainder of the financial year.'

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Equity slump in Japan prompts
Salomon revamp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE prolonged slump of the Tokyo stock market has forced Salomon Brothers,
the US securities house, to restructure its Tokyo operations.
Salomon, which raked in profits from computer-driven programme trading, was
virtually unaffected by the fall in commissions due to the decline in
trading volume.
However, it has fallen victim to the fall in market volatility caused by the
Japanese government's stock market support operations to stabilise share
prices.
The US house plans to cut 60 jobs in back-office and administrative
operations for its Japanese equities division through voluntary retirement.
Salomon is also considering moving out of its expensive location in the
heart of Tokyo's business centre, which also houses the stock and bond
trading headquarters of Nomura Securities and the Tokyo branch of Barclays
de Zoete Wedd.
The move by Salomon follows a wave of restructuring moves by other foreign
brokerages. County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster Bank,
gave up membership on the Tokyo exchange last December, and Merrill Lynch
recently announced the closure of its three retail branches.
US securities houses, with expertise in stock futures and options trading,
have been the leading earners in the Tokyo stock market, using arbitrage to
exploit the difference in prices between the cash markets and the stock
index futures markets.
However, the recent lack of price movements due to market support by the
Japanese government has depressed arbitrage possibilities.
In addition, Japanese and other foreign brokers have entered the arbitrage
business, and the increase in market participants has narrowed profit
chances.
Salomon said it would focus on domestic and international bond trading
businesses, and investment banking, including capital raising and strategic
client services.

However, the 1991-92 result was struck after various one-time items,
including a Dollars 2.1bn extraordinary gain and a Dollars 1.68bn
reorganisation charge.
In the final quarter of 1992-93, Federated made an after-tax profit of

CANADIAN PACIFIC's Forest Products arm, CPFP, is planning to raise CDollars
160m (USDollars 128m) of new equity in order to bolster working capital and
to support the remaining portion of its heavy investment programme.
However, Canadian Pacific is not taking up any of the 8m common shares,
which are being sold at CDollars 20 a share to an investment group headed by
Scotia McLeod. Its total interest in CPFP will drop from 70 per cent to 60.7
per cent.
The Forest Products arm raised USDollars 75m in a debenture issue in January
and last raised new equity in 1992 with an issue at CDollars 26.50 a share.
CP took up 20 per cent.
CPFP, one of North America's biggest newsprint producers, has omitted its
common share dividend to conserve cash. It suffered a loss for 1992 of
CDollars 248m, or CDollars 4.82 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.8bn, after
restructuring charges.
SNC, Canada's biggest engineering group, benefited from rationalisation and
growing international business, which are helping to offset the long
domestic recession. Fourth-quarter net profit was CDollars 6.5m, or 45 cents
a share, against a loss of CDollars 1.9m, or 17 cents, a year earlier on
revenues ahead at CDollars 255m, against CDollars 211m.

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Turner plans new European TV
station
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TED Turner, the television magnate, is launching a new satellite
television channel for Europe in September.
Turner Network Television Europe yesterday announced plans for a
24-hours-a-day channel that will show 14 hours of cartoons a day, from 6am
to 8pm, with films making up the rest of the schedule.
The new channel, which will be broadcast by the Astra satellite to cable
networks and home dishes, is being put together from two Turner satellite
networks in the US, The Cartoon Network and Turner Network Television.
'The popularity of our cartoons, films and other entertainment programming
in Europe prompted us to bring these two services to the region,' Mr Turner,
chairman of the Turner Broadcasting System, said yesterday.
The new channel will draw upon more than 8,500 cartoons made by MGM, Warner
Bros and Hanna-Barbera and the Turner library of around 2,500 feature films.
It will intensify competition in the European market for children's
programming on satellite television.
The long-established Children's Channel - whose main shareholders include
TCI, the Denver-based cable television company, and Flextech of the UK -
will now face two rivals by the autumn.
Viacom has announced it is bringing Nickelodeon, its children's channel, to
the UK in a joint venture with British Sky Broadcasting.
The Cartoon Network and TNT will be delivered in English, although some
programmes will be subtitled and dubbed.
Mr Turner's Cable News Network is already broadcast throughout Europe on the
Astra system.
The new channel will initially be financed by advertising, although it could
later become a subscription service.

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mexican government changes
channels - The forthcoming privatisations could usher in a media revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEXICAN government has ushered in a potential revolution in the
country's broadcasting and media markets by announcing the terms of the
privatisations of two state-owned television channels, dozens of cinemas and
the El Nacional news-paper.
Televisa, Mexico's dominant media company, will face real competition for
the first time. The favoured bidders for the stations are all backed by rich
partners, and most have long experience in Mexican radio and local
television. All are aiming to take a slice of Televisa's audience share of
around 90 per cent.
Investors have to register their interest and submit business plans by the
end of this month for all or parts of the media package under sale.
The potential rewards are huge. Televisa's revenues from television were
around Dollars 1bn last year, 27 per cent up in real terms on 1991.
Growth prospects are favourable: advertising cost per thousand viewers is
one-fifth of that in the US, while steady economic growth and a young
population mean advertising demand should grow substantially.
But much to the annoyance of advertisers, Televisa forces them to pay a year
in advance. It has increased its advertising rates well beyond inflation:
they more than doubled in 1990, rose by 40 to 60 per cent in 1991, and went
up by another 30 per cent late last year.
Televisa's heavy-handed support of Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, including a recent pledge to give the party at least
Dollars 25m, could become a handicap. One of the bidders for the state-owned
networks says: 'Televisa is a very powerful company, heavily protected by
the government. Nevertheless, it is a monopoly and people grow tired of
monopolies.'
There are four favoured bidders for the two state-owned channels: Mr
Clemente Serna of Radio Programas de Mexico: Mr Joaquin Vargas Gomez, who
runs the subscriber-only television company, Multivision: the Aguirre family
of Radio Centro, with Mr Ricardo Salinas of the electrical stores group,
Elektra: and Mr Raymundo Gomez Flores, a rich businessman from Guadalajara,
who owns Banca Cremi. Mr Gomez Flores may team up with whomever emerges as
the winner.
Mr Serna runs Mexico City's most successful radio station, Radio Red, and
owns a local television channel in Guadalajara. He is backed by rich
partners. He maintains: 'It will take three years to compete with Televisa,
and will be very difficult - but we have the resources.'
Mr Serna is buoyed by the success of his Channel 6 in Guadalajara, which has
more than held its own against Televisa. 'They are very worried about losing
their national monopoly because then their power evaporates,' he says.
Televisa, however, will be a tough competitor. It is a successful programme
maker, with soap operas hit successes from Moscow to Los Angeles. Second, Mr
Emilio Azcarraga, its president, and reportedly Mexico's richest man, is a
survivor, having fought off attempts of expropriation from former Mexican
president Mr Luis Echeverria, and won practically all intra-family battles
over control for the company.
Mr Azcarraga's latest strategy is to turn Televisa into a international
media empire, which dominates programming, broadcasting, distribution and
advertising in the Hispanic world.
Televisa has also been on a buying spree. The deals include a 25 per cent
interest in Univision, the largest Spanish-speaking media group in the US,
and a 76 per cent interest in Peruana de radio Difusion, a Peruvian
television and radio station.
The group has bought American Publishing Group - the world's largest Spanish
language publishing house, with more than 80 magazines - for Dollars 130m,
and has 70 per cent of Oviacones, a tabloid-style newspaper in Mexico.
Earlier this year Mr Azcarraga bought PanAmSat, giving him control over
satellite distribution of his programmes across the world.
Televisa already owns radio stations in Mexico, record labels, football
teams and a bull-fighting stadium.
It is also set to control a third national network in Mexico. The Mexican
government has announced it will give concessions for 62 local repeater
stations, and Televisa has all but declared it will be given the stations,
enabling it to turn Mexico City's Channel 9 into a national network.
Televisa's market dominance gives it an edge when dealing with advertisers.
It has, for example, signed big advertisers - such as Pepsi-Cola and Colgate
 -in a three-year advertising deal. It also offers free spots to companies
that promise not to advertise elsewhere.
A government official in Mexico's trade ministry said such restrictive
practices would probably be illegal once Mexico's anti-monopoly law comes
into force later this year.
However, at least one bidder was nervous that the government would be
unwilling to enforce the law against its long-time supporter.

SIME Darby, the Malaysia-based conglomerate that has grown into one of the
region's leading multinationals, posted a 9.3 per cent rise in net
first-half profits to MDollars 170.9m (USDollars 65.25m) from MDollars
156.4m a year earlier, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Earnings per share rose to 10.9 cents from 10.0 cents, and the interim
dividend is being maintained at 3.5 cents a share.
Pre-tax profits rose to MDollars 374.7m from MDollars 358.8m on turnover 6.8
per cent ahead at MDollars 3.32bn from MDollars 3.11m.
However, the directors said the results for the second half were unlikely to
show noticeable improvement as in previous years, and they expected
profitability to be maintained at the same level as in the first six months.
The Malaysia region was the top profit contributor, due to strong results
from the oil and gas division.

<TEXT>
UNI STOREBRAND, the Norwegian insurer, yesterday revealed a big loss in 1992
due to a NKr2.63bn (Dollars 373m) write-down on the group's 28 per cent
stake in Skandia Forsak-rings, Sweden's biggest insurer.
Uni reported a consolidated pre-tax loss of NKr3.38bn against a profit of
NKr471m in 1991. Last August, Uni collapsed into the hands of public
administrators after failing to service NKr3.6bn in short-term debt accrued
to finance a failed raid on Skandia.
Uni said it would strive to dispose of the NKr4.7bn Skandia stake as soon as
possible.
Group net operating income rose slightly last year to NKr20.48bn from
NKr19.54bn as operating costs remained largely the same at NKr4.07bn. Mr Per
Terje Vold, chief executive, said that, considering the difficult times
which the group had experienced, the results achieved by the life and
non-life divisions were acceptable.
'We are pleased to note that the results of the life and non-life insurance
companies improved significantly during the last four months of the year,'
Mr Vold said.
The life insurance division lifted premium income by NKr90m to NKr4.74bn in
1992, but investment income fell by NKr387m to NKr4.99bn. Operating profit
rose to NKr1.91bn from NKr1.09bn. The share portfolio was written down by
NKr537m.
The non-life business saw premium income in 1992 fall by 2.5 per cent to
NKr6.872bn as operating costs were cut by NKr128m to NKr1.8bn. Operating
profit rose to NKr345m from NKr281m.
Uni said the non-life result was compromised by a NKr123m loss due to a
hurricane which struck north-west Norway. It also suffered a NKr168m
realised loss and write-down on the securities portfolio.
The group's international business saw premium income rise by 6.5 per cent
to NKr4.702bn, but investment income fell by NKr175m to NKr323m. The
division plunged into an operating loss of NKr546m last year, against a
profit of NKr64m a year earlier.
Uni said the poor result was due in part to a NKr164m charge to cover damage
resulting from hurricane Andrew. The international business will engage in
reinsurance business only while the marine, oil, satellite and liability
operations are to be transferred to the non-life business once approval is
given by authorities.
Mr Vold forecast an improvement in 1993 through cutting costs, increasing
premiums and reducing the risk profile of investments.

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Traub and Maho scrap agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRAUB and Maho, two of Germany's largest machine tool makers, have scrapped
a collaboration agreement announced three months ago.
The link, which was to start with joint distribution and service networks
and extend into buying and product development, was broken because of
structural differences, Traub said.
Instead, the company, Germany's second-biggest lathe maker after
Gildemeister, has joined forces with Berthold Hermle, a much smaller milling
and drilling machine specialist.
At present, Hermle does around 70 per cent of its business in Germany,
although its Swiss subsidiary Aciera and a newly founded US arm put in a
strong performance last year.
Overseas sales rose 27 per cent in the first nine months of last year to
DM27m (Dollars 16.8m), while turnover at the German parent fell 25 per cent
to DM64m. Reporting these figures in December, the company warned
shareholders to expect heavy losses.
In 1991, the last year for which figures are available, Traub lost almost
DM30m.
Meanwhile, Maho is understood to be continuing negotiations with rival
Deckel on co-operation in manufacturing.

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Currency crisis takes its toll
on Legrand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGRAND, the electrical equipment group which has traditionally been seen as
one of the most resilient French industrial companies, saw net profits fall
by 6.5 per cent to FFr657m (Dollars 116.23m) in 1992 from FFr703m in 1991.
The group's main problem last year was the strength of the franc following
the September currency crisis which took a toll on its income from outside
France.
Legrand last year performed slightly below the expectations of analysts, who
had been forecasting a slight improvement for the group in 1992.
Legrand, which has maintained its dividend at FFr57.50 for ordinary shares
and FFr92 for 'privileged' shares, said it was well-placed to withstand
another difficult year. 'Everything is in place so that we can cope with the
deterioration in the economic environment without jeopardising out plans for
the future,' it said.
The group, which is involved in both the production and distribution of
electrical equipment, managed to increase turnover by 3 per cent (just ahead
of French inflation) to FFr10.25bn from FFr9.95bn in 1991.
However, Legrand estimated that it 'lost' FFr100m in net profits last year
because of currency fluctuations in the final quarter and exceptional
financial costs.

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Indosuez succumbs to pressure on
French banks
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Indosuez, a subsidiary of Suez, the troubled French holding company,
yesterday highlighted the pressures on the French banking sector by
revealing a sharp fall in net profits to FFr101m (Dollars 18m) last year
from FFr805m in 1991.
Mr Antoine Jeancourt-Galignani, chairman, said he hoped Indosuez would move
back towards 'normal profits' this year. However, its poor performance in
1992 was one of the main reasons for last week's announcement by Suez that
it made a loss last year for the first time.
Suez's shares, which have risen rapidly on takeover speculation since last
week's disclosure, yesterday rose again by FFr2.20 to close at FFr320.70.
Market sources said more than 870,000 Suez shares were traded yesterday
after 1.6m shares (more than 1 per cent of the capital) changed hands on
Friday.
Axa, the French insurance group, Mr James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French
industrialist, and Mr Jean-Marc Vernes, the French financier, have been
mooted as possible bidders for Suez, one of France's most prominent holding
companies with interests spread across industry and finance. Suez does have
the support of several 'friendly' shareholders.
One of Suez's chief problems has been the difficulties of its banking
subsidiaries, which include Banque La Henin as well as Indosuez, both of
which have been heavily exposed to the precarious state of the property
market, particularly in Paris.
Indosuez, one of France's leading investment banks, was forced to raise its
net provisions from FFr1.55bn in 1991 to FFr3.59bn in 1992 mainly because of
its losses on loans to property developers. The bank was also hit by the
fragile state of small businesses.
These pressures took a toll on net profits despite an increase in
exceptional gains to FFr1.3bn in 1992 from FFr362m in 1991. Indosuez was
also resilient on the operational front with net banking income up at
FFr11.31bn from FFr10.93bn over the same period and gross operating profits
to FFr3.78bn from FFr3.46bn mainly due to its expansion in Asia and the
Middle East.

Italcable to L130bn

<TEXT>
ITALCABLE, the Italian state-controlled international telecommunications
utility, reported a slight fall in net profits to L130.3bn (Dollars 82.7m)
last year from L132.7bn in 1991.
The decrease, which comes in spite of a 16.6 per cent surge in turnover to
almost L790bn, stems largely from the progressive reductions in Italy's very
high charges for international telephone traffic. The price cuts stimulated
a 26.3 per cent rise in international telephone traffic last year, in spite
of the recession.
The company, which said it was satisfied with the results, particularly in
view of the higher financial charges it had faced in 1992, will pay an
unchanged dividend of L230 for ordinary shares and L250 a share for savings
stock.
Italcable said the volume of directly-dialled international calls had risen
56 per cent last year due to of improved marketing, improved quality and
tariff cuts. The increase in data transmissions had been held to 13 per cent
by growing competition under liberalisation laws, and the company planned
substantial tariff cuts.

COLOR LINE, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, said 1992 pre-tax profits
nearly doubled to NKr80m (Dollars 11.35m) from NKr44m in 1991. Group
operating profit rose to NKr313m from NKr212m, as sales rose to NKr1.67bn
from NKr1.43bn.
Mr Jon Erik Nygaard, chief executive, said the group's four cruise ferry
lines between Norway, Denmark, Germany and the UK set new traffic records in
1992. Passenger volume rose 9 per cent, representing 1.9m passengers, and
80,000 freight units, an increase of 6 per cent.
Net financial items rose to NKr233m in 1992 from NKr168m in 1991 due in part
to a NKr31m non-capitalised currency loss on long-term D-Mark debt. Mr
Nygaard said bookings for 1993 were satisfactory and showed continued
development in the German market.
Exportfinans, Norway's export lending institution, reported gross income up
17 per cent in 1992 to NKr312m from NKr267m last time.
Net income rose to NKr225m from NKr202m. Loans disbursed in 1992 to the
domestic export industry reached NKr4.35bn, up NKr300m.

<TEXT>
ALUSUISSE-LONZA, the Swiss aluminium, packaging and chemicals group, said
its net profit jumped 19.8 per cent in 1992 to SFr121m (Dollars 78.26m), due
to large margin gains in its chemical and packaging businesses.
Sales rose only 3.4 per cent to SFr6.5bn, but the group benefited from
specialising in fine chemicals and environmentally friendly packaging
systems.
The directors said in the annual report that this result, after a 63 per
cent slump in profits last year, was 'satisfactory'. It proved the merit of
the group's strategy to restructure its businesses to reduce their
vulnerability to economic cycles.
Operating profits were up 19 per cent to SFr350m, with packaging profits
soaring 51 per cent to SFr127m and chemicals profits advancing 27 per cent
to SFr142m. Profits on aluminium businesses, on the other hand, fell 13.5
per cent to SFr83m.
In January, the group announced the closure of its last remaining aluminium
smelter in Switzerland. Closure costs for this and other restructuring
measures jumped by over one-third to SFr97m.
The directors said that the strains being felt by other companies in the
chemical and packaging sectors in the current recession might throw up
further acquisition opportunities for the group.
Elektrowatt, the Swiss electric utilities and engineering group, said its
net profit in the year to September 30 1992 fell 19 per cent to SFr170m.
Sales were up 1.6 per cent to SFr4.61bn.

FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Accor close to Hungarian hotel
chain deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOR, the French hotel group, has entered the final stage of talks with
Hungary's privatisation authorities for the acquisition of a 51 per cent
stake in Pannonia, the country's main mid-market hotel chain.
Accor's bid, which topped an offer by a private group of investors, is
understood to value Pannonia at well in excess of Ft8.9bn (Dollars 103m),
the company's last reported book value. Precise terms were not disclosed and
the finalisation of a formal agreement remains subject to achieving
financing arrangements.
Pannonia has interests in 27 hotels, including the Budapest Novotel, which
the Hungarian company owned and managed under franchise from Accor's Novotel
unit. Accor is also looking to Pannonia to be its vehicle for future
expansion in neighbouring countries.
The French group, Europe's largest hotel group, has been among the most
active in the region, managing or investing in 13 hotels in Poland, Russia,
Bulgaria and Hungary. Accor is also involved in hotel developments in
Romania and the Czech Republic and has set itself a target of 50 hotels in
the region.
The privatisation authorities plan to float the state's remaining
shareholding in the chain.
The attractions of eastern Europe for Accor and other investors in the hotel
sector have been low labour costs, consequently high margins and the large
potential for growth.
Financing has, however, been a problem because the hotel market is depressed
internationally and investors are wary of political and economic risks, and
uncertainty over title to property in eastern Europe.
Legal problems held back financing of the acquisition by Marriott, the US
hotel operator, of Budapest's Duna Intercontinental hotel. Marriott, backed
by a financial consortium led by GiroCredit of Austria, last week finally
agreed to pay Dollars 53m for the state-owned hotel after breaking numerous
payment deadlines.
Advisers to the Hungarian government were confident yesterday that there
would be relatively healthy institutional appetite for Pannonia and that
financing would be possible.

approaches from third parties.
Last Friday, Wills, an industrial, electronic and automotive products
company, announced that it had acquired 30,000 Platon ordinary shares (0.03
per cent) at 26 1/2 p each. Wills has received irrevocable undertakings to
accept the offer from shareholders holding a further 15.7 per cent.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: CCS seeks support for reconstruction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CCS Group, the building materials company, is planning a capital
reconstruction which, if approved by shareholders and the High Court, would
lead to a resumption in the trading of its shares on the USM.
The shares were suspended at 2p and receivers called in during July 1991.
The latest accounts, for the year to end-October 1992, showed that CCS has
accumulated losses of Pounds 4.95m. These would be eliminated and a reserve
of Pounds 17,000 created by a reconstruction which has two principal
elements.
Lloyds Bank is consolidating all its lending and accumulated interest into
one loan of Pounds 351,801 and Midland Bank, owed Pounds 911,974, is
converting Pounds 300,000 into preference shares carrying interest of 7 per
cent initially and redeemable in five tranches and converting Pounds 100,000
into loan stock, while writing off the balance.
CCS also plans to sub-divide its 20p shares into one 2p ordinary and one 18p
deferred share, which will be cancelled. The share premium account of Pounds
624,000 will be cancelled.

GREGGS, the bread, confect-ionery and savoury products group, reported a 15
per cent rise, from Pounds 6.07m to Pounds 6.97m, in pre-tax profits for the
year to December 26. The result, taking in a Pounds 134,000 loss on a
property disposal, was achieved on turnover up 6 per cent to Pounds 101m,
against Pounds 95.5m.
Describing 1992 as a 'much better year', Mr Mike Darrington, managing
director, said stable ingredient prices, improved efficiency and cost
control had more than offset the effects of recession, increased competition
and further escalation in rents.
The company was trading from 487 outlets at the year end, a net increase of
13. Net cash stood at Pounds 6.7m, up Pounds 1.7m.
Earnings per share rose to 40.6p (36.8p). The proposed final dividend is
10p, making a total of 15p (14.125p).

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cost controls help Greggs rise by 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREGGS, the bread, confectionery and savoury products group, reported a 15
per cent rise, from Pounds 6.07m to Pounds 6.97m, in profits before tax for
the 12 months to December 26 1992.
The outcome, which took in a Pounds 134,000 loss on a property disposal, was
achieved on turnover up 6 per cent to Pounds 101m (Pounds 95.5m), the first
time the company has broken through the Pounds 100m barrier.
Describing 1992 as a 'much better year", Mr Mike Darrington, managing
director, said stable ingredient prices and improved efficiency and cost
control had more than offset continuing effects of recession, increased
competition and further escalation in rents.
All divisions showed improved performances compared with 1991. The company
was trading from 487 outlets at the year end, a net increase of 13. Net cash
stood at Pounds 6.7m, up Pounds 1.7m.
With the volume trend slowly improving and 1993 sales and profit to date
ahead of budget and of last year, Mr Darrington expressed cautious optimism
despite recent ingredient price increases caused by sterling's devaluation.
However, he urged the government to outlaw 'highly inflationary upward-only'
rent review clauses: further escalation of rents in 1992 meant the
proportion of turnover absorbed by rent was effectively depressing profits
by Pounds 1.5m a year, compared with five years ago.
Mr Darrington said Greggs hoped to double the size of its core business in
the next seven to eight years and diversify into new areas, which he
declined to specify.
Earnings per share rose to 40.6p (36.8p). The proposed final dividend is
10p, making a total of 15p (14.125p).

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: 30% rise in house sales for Persimmon -
Shares advance as uncovered dividend held despite halving of profits to
Pounds 10.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DUNCAN Davidson, chairman of Persimmon, the York-based housebuilder, said
that since the new year the group's house sales had jumped 30 per cent
compared with the same period in 1992.
This further confirmation of a revival in the UK housing market, together
with the fact that group did not announce a rights issue with its results
for 1992, sent the shares 5p higher to 240p.
The group also announced it was maintaining its final dividend at 5.8p
making an unchanged total of 8.6p. This was despite a drop in earnings per
share from 16.8p to 7.3p, pre-tax profits having been halved at Pounds 10.2m
(Pounds 22.3m).
Persimmon plans to increase its output from 2,340 homes last year, up from
2,324, to 4,000 homes a year by the mid-1990s, making it one of Britain's
five largest housebuilders.
Mr Davidson said that it would be in the best interests of shareholders to
finance this expansion from cash flow, improved margins and increased
borrowings, although, he could not rule out a rights issue at some stage in
the future.
Net debt of Pounds 33m (Pounds 32m) at the end of last year was equivalent
to gearing of 26 per cent. Interest payable rose from Pounds 2.58m to Pounds
4.1m.
Persimmon said that profits last year would have been higher but for a
Pounds 3.1m provision against some of the group's development sites. If
provisions were excluded the dividend was covered 1.23 times it said.
Mr Davidson said that the company had sold 1,318 houses during the first two
months of this year, compared with 1,028 in the corresponding period last
year.
However, he remained cautious of talking about a revival in the housing
market. 'We have seen these sort of gains before only for rises to peter
out. Let us hope we are looking at a more sustained increase this time.'
COMMENT
Persimmon, anticipating a revival in house sales, increased the number of
sites from which it sells by more than a quarter during the past 18 months.
A delay in recovery meant that it was carrying additional overheads last
year while net operating margins, before provisions, shrank from 16 per cent
to just 9 per cent. The group therefore needs to increase volume sales. Only
then will it be able to start reducing sales incentives and recover some of
its lost margin. Improvement in margins is likely to be slow and is not
expected to occur until later in the second half, provided the current sales
improvement is maintained. The intention to increase gearing rather than
raise new equity to support expansion is to be applauded however. Sales of
2,850 homes this year should provide pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 16m
putting the group on prospective p/e of more than 20. Any improvement is
already in the price.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: M&amp;G Group seeks clients in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G Group, Britain's largest unit trust company, has reached agreement with
Dreyfus Corporation, one of the US's largest mutual fund managers, to offer
international equity and fixed interest products to American clients.
The move is M&amp;G's first significant effort to seek clients abroad and
Dreyfus's first foray into international products for its mutual fund and
institutional clients.
Competition for UK domestic unit trust clients generally has intensified
with increasing numbers of firms offering the product while the number of
unitholder accounts is still lower than it was at the end of the industry's
peak year of 1987.
'We realised we were particularly sensitive to UK economic conditions,' said
Mr David Morgan, managing director of M&amp;G Investment Management. M&amp;G's core
mutual fund activities, like those of the rest of the industry, suffered
during the recession as investors shunned the product generally in favor of
safer building society deposits. M&amp;G began searching for a US partner more
than 18 months ago in an effort to diversify its client base overseas.
Mr Morgan said the company was hoping to capitalise on the growing interest
of US pension funds for international fund management services.
Dreyfus Corporation administers more than Pounds 56bn in more than 125
mutual funds around the country, much of it in fixed income products. It is
roughly the fourth largest US mutual fund manager.
M&amp;G will offer two international mutual funds for Dreyfus's clients, one for
retail clients and one aimed at 401K personal pension accounts and
co-mingled pension funds.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Drayton Asia feels fire on its neck - A bid
battle in the investment trust arena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAGONS ARE not supposed to be the underdogs. But that is the status of EFM
Dragon, the Far East investment trust, which is bidding for Drayton Asia, an
opponent twice its size - the relative market capitalisations are Pounds 57m
and Pounds 116m.
Some of the fire in EFM Dragon's bid comes from its big brother, the Coal
Board pension fund. It owns 20 per cent of both EFM Dragon and Invesco MIM,
and has given its support, in the form of a letter of intent, to the bid.
In addition it owns 85 per cent of British Investment Trust, which in turn
owns 54.3 per cent of Edinburgh Fund Managers, which manages EFM Dragon.
The pension fund's backing has helped EFM get off to a good start.
Irrevocable undertakings to accept in respect of 13.6 per cent of the shares
have been received from holders such as Co-Operative Insurance and Newton
Investment Management. Added to the letters of intent, EFM Dragon already
has the backing of 36.7 per cent of the shares.
An important factor may be the perceived unpopularity of Drayton Asia's
investment managers, Invesco MIM. There do seen to be times in the
investment trust sector when one group comes under repeated attack. It was
Touche Remnant in the mid-1980s and it seems to be Invesco MIM at present.
The problems of Drayton Consolidated, where Invesco was forced to pay Pounds
9.5m in compensation to shareholders; a fine from IMRO, the investment
management regulator; and the group's involvement in the Maxwell affair have
all resulted in difficult publicity.
Perhaps investor reluctance to back Invesco MIM led to the shares falling to
a discount to net asset value, which reached 26.8 per cent at one point in
1992.
When a trust's shares fall to a wide discount, opportunity arises for an
outside bidder. A bid just below asset value offers a profit for existing
shareholders, plus the chance for a bidder to buy a portfolio at a
reasonable price.
EFM Dragon, in contrast, has often seen its shares trade at a premium. In
essence, this represents an incentive to expand. EFM could take the option
of a placing or a rights issue but it would probably find it impossible to
raise as much as it could by buying Drayton Asia, which also comes with a
ready-assembled portfolio of Far Eastern stocks.
If the bid succeeds, EFM Dragon argues that investment trust shareholders
are only likely to accept a paper offer from another trust if they believe
that the bidders are better managers.
As the graph shows, EFM Dragon has clearly outperformed Drayton Asia since
the start of 1992. But the Drayton team argues that this outperformance is
due to the Dragon policy of gearing up the trust, which improves the
performance of trusts in bull markets, but damages it in bear markets.
The Drayton team has decided not to gear up, because it feels the Far East
stock markets are volatile enough already. The essence of the Drayton
argument is that EFM Dragon may have provided higher rewards, but at the
expense of higher risk.
'Gearing is part of management,' says Mr Ian Watt of Edinburgh Fund
Managers. 'We took a bullish view of markets and it worked. But our
performance is more due to stock selection and asset allocation.'
Whatever the facts on performance, Drayton argues that EFM Dragon is trying
to buy the trust on the cheap.
Bids are couched in terms of the formula asset value, which is the net asset
value, minus the costs associated with the offer. In this case, EFM is
offering shares worth 96.4 per cent of Drayton Asia's formula asset value,
which in turn is about 3 percentage points less than the target's net asset
value.
Drayton also points to the lack of a cash alternative. The value of EFM
Dragon's offer thus depends on its shares. If those shares fell to a
discount of 9 per cent, the average for the year to March 3, Drayton says
the value of EFM's share offer would fall to 86 per cent of its undiluted
net asset value.
Mr Lewis Aaron, senior investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities
backs Drayton on this point. 'I think the bid is an opportunistic attack on
a fund management group when it is most vulnerable.
'EFM Dragon will probably go to a discount if the bid succeeds, because it
will be a much bigger trust. Therefore I think the bid is not high enough
and there is not a cash alternative.'
But with so many of the Drayton Asia's shareholders backing EFM, the trust
realises that these arguments may carry little weight. It is seeking to
produce alternative proposals which might give investors better value.
Normally, trusts faced with a predator resort to one of two schemes -
unitisation or a split capital structure.
The former turns the fund into a unit trust, which trades at asset value,
and can be realised for cash. The latter, by splitting the share capital
into more tax-efficient components, may eliminate the discount by creating
extra demand for the shares. But the lack of income from Far Eastern stocks
may not make a split capital structure possible in this case.
Drayton, unless it can find an alternative bidder, may thus be forced down
the unitisation route. But with the bid nearly a month old, it needs to act
quickly.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: FNFC requests banks to extend agreements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST NATIONAL Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, has written
to its 120 banks - to which it owes Pounds 1.3bn - asking them to extend or
maintain lending agreements while the group's funding is determined.
FNFC is in default on its loans because of what it decribes as 'trivial' and
'technical' breaches of agreements, of which it has more than 100.
Mr Martin Mays-Smith, chairman, said the default was not on payment
obligations: 'We have always paid interest and continue to do so. The only
thing that is significant is that the banks have a legal right to immediate
repayment.'
FNFC is asking the banks to waive the breaches - which are to do with
infringements of bans on guarantees between parent and subsidiaries - and to
maintain facilities. This includes extending the expiry date on about Pounds
250m of loans, due this month, in the group's main subsidiary, First
National Bank. Yesterday the group was composing a letter to shareholders
which also deals with changes in circumstances since a Pounds 45.8m rights
issue of convertible preference shares was announced on January 15. The
issue was necessary to repair a capital base weakened by two years of heavy
losses.
The breaches of banking agreements were not disclosed at the time even
though most were known about by management and Kleinwort Benson, its
merchant bank. It was decided they were not important because they were
'old, technical and expected to be remedied in the short-term,' as one
advisers put it yesterday.
The breaches have prevented Pounds 160m being raised through the
securitisation of unsecured home improvement loans. This was planned for the
first half of this year, the rights issue document said.
The impression was given at the time of the issue that Pounds 100m of new
term finance would be made available. This has not come to fruition either.
Mr Mays-Smith said on Friday that some banks in one of the syndicates were
'fussing a bit'. Some of the overseas lenders were under pressure to reduce
their UK exposure.
As he faces a period of intense negotiations with the banks, he anticipates
there will again be 'a few on the periphery who will cause trouble.
'There are occasions when a militant minority stop something sensible being
done, but that's not very often.'
As well as seeking waivers of breaches and extension of facilities, the
discussions hope to condense the 100-plus agreements into three - one for
the parent and one for each of the main subsidiaries. Management consultants
will check internal controls on who can write what into documents, to avoid
the contradictions that ed to the breaches. The share price, which rose to
80p last month, was 57p.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Securities losses cut Barings to Pounds
21.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARING SECURITIES, the securities arm of Barings, the merchant banking
group, returned to profit in the last quarter, though earlier losses and
reorganisation costs were sufficient to halve profits for 1992.
The outcome showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 42.5m) after
Pounds 8.9m of reorganisation costs at its securities subsidiary in the
second half. The problems at the offshoot emerged when the group announced
interim figures and stemmed from losses in Japan and continental Europe.
The return to profit in securities was accounted for in part by sterling's
devaluation, said Mr Peter Baring, chairman. A large proportion of costs are
in sterling, while much of its revenue is in foreign currencies. Also, a
move to cut more than 100 jobs had reduced costs by about 20 per cent.
Japan had remained a difficult market, though losses there had been more
than offset by profits in south-east Asia and Latin America, Mr Baring said.
The operation is thought to have remained in profit so far this year.
Without the securities losses, Barings' profits would have increased in
1992, with asset management and corporate finance ahead and profits in the
banking and capital markets division only just behind 1991 levels. The group
does not provide a detailed breakdown.

SLUGGISH SALES on the high street failed to restrict growth at Domestic &amp;
General.
The USM-traded specialist domestic appliance breakdown insurer yesterday
reported a 26 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.43m (Pounds
2.73m) for the six months to end-December.
D&amp;G, in which Eagle Star, the composite insurer, has a 10 per cent stake,
lifted the interim dividend by 25 per cent to 7.5p. Earnings per share were
also ahead 26 per cent, to 33.55p.
Mr Howard James, managing director, said that the group intended to continue
its expansion in the UK, where it has established marketing agreements with
leading manufacturers such as Zanussi, Grundig and Electrolux and retailers
such as Selfridges and Comet to sell its policies.
He said that most of the group's recent growth reflected an increase in the
overall size of the market for domestic appliance insurance.
Gross premiums increased 23 per cent to Pounds 26.2m (Pounds 21.4m). Other
income was up 22 per cent to Pounds 265,000 (Pounds 217,000).

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: NWRe closure sparks concern over capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN ABOUT a shortage of capacity at the London insurance and reinsurance
market is growing in the wake of last week's decision by NWRe to cease
underwriting.
NWRe is the latest in a number of withdrawals from the market, where
companies frequently do business alongside syndicates at Lloyd's.
The company, jointly owned by Norwich Union, Winterthur of Switzerland and
Chiyoda of Japan, announced its closure last Friday. It said its 1992
trading results were 'unacceptable', partially due to claims from hurricanes
Andrew and Iniki.
The company has also been hit by continuing claims on marine, aviation and
liability insurance policies. Some 180 jobs, including 40 in London, will be
lost as a result of the decision taken at a board meeting last Wednesday.
Established in 1976, NWRe wrote a broad book of London market business, and
was a leader in both marine and non-marine reinsurance. Premium income was
Pounds 110m in 1992.
Underwriters said yesterday the decision could have a substantial impact on
the marine liability reinsurance market.
Others suggested it could dent the confidence of management at similar sized
companies, triggering further closures.
'At a time we are trying to attract new business to London, it will knock
people's confidence in the market,' said one prominent company underwriter.
Over the last few months, a number of companies, including English &amp;
American, Cigna and Yasuda, have either withdrawn from the London market or
reduced their involvement.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: CCS seeks backing for capital
reconstruction plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CCS GROUP, the Staffordshire-based building materials company, is planning a
capital reconstruction which, if approved by shareholders and the High
Court, will lead to a resumption in the trading of its shares on the USM.
The shares were suspended at 2p and receivers called in during July 1991.
The latest accounts, for the year to end-October 1992, showed that CCS has
accumulated losses of Pounds 4.95m. These will be eliminated and a reserve
of Pounds 17,000 created by a reconstruction which has two principal
elements.
The first relates to bank borrowings. Lloyds Bank is consolidating all its
lending and accumulated interest into one loan of Pounds 351,801. Midland
Bank, owed Pounds 911,974, is converting Pounds 300,000 into preference
shares carrying interest of 7 per cent initially and redeemable in five
tranches from 1996 and converting Pounds 100,000 into loan stock, while
writing off the balance.
The second element relates to the ordinary shares which have a nominal value
of 20p. CCS plans to reduce their value to 2p, by sub-dividing each one into
a 2p ordinary and an 18p deferred share and then cancelling the latter. The
share premium account of Pounds 624,000 will be cancelled.
CCS is now reduced to one trading subsidiary, G Blagg, which is operating
profitably.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cornwell Parker down 22%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CORNWELL PARKER, the furniture and fabrics group, blamed recession for a 22
per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year to January 31.
Profits fell from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 2.92m on reduced sales of Pounds
43.1m (Pounds 44.1m).
The furniture division started the year with low order books resulting in a
fall in revenue in the first six months. Margins, however, were maintained
and a trading profit of Pounds 2.23m was earned on turnover of Pounds 24.8m.
Fabrics made a trading profit of Pounds 882,000 on sales of Pounds 18.4m.
The operation has been affected by the 50 per cent fall in the number of
people moving house since 1989.
Borrowings rose from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 4.7m, reflecting the
acquisition of Fardis, the French furnishing fabric business, giving gearing
of 10 per cent.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.7p, payable from earnings per share
of 4.6p (6.2p).

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Alliance &amp; Leics ahead to Pounds 122.5m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester Building Society yesterday announced a 23 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits last year, from Pounds 99.5m to Pounds 122.5m,
after reducing provisions on its troubled commercial lending book from
Pounds 117.4m to Pounds 49.5m.
The society reduced its overall provisions for bad loans to Pounds 203.6m
(Pounds 215.1m).
The reduction in commercial provisions was offset by a rise in provisions on
residential lending to Pounds 128.6m (Pounds 69.7m) because of house price
falls.
It made a steep cut in mortgage lending to Pounds 1.26bn (Pounds 2.74bn),
which it said was due to maintaining a 'prudent' lending policy to protect
itself from a 'step-change' in the level of risk attached to residential
lending.
One of the strongest contributors to profit was the Girobank subsidiary,
which contributed Pounds 64.4m (Pounds 48.8m).
The profit was helped by growth in money transmission and a 20 per cent
reduction in staff.
Mr Peter White, chief executive, said the society was gradually reducing its
exposure to commercial property and lending fell to Pounds 570m (Pounds
500m). It ceased commercial lending except to develop and sell properties.
Mr White said the society expected to develop its personal banking business
aided by Girobank's money transmission facilities. It would try to develop
current accounts, and cross-selling of products such as life assurance.
He said the society, which increased its total assets marginally to Pounds
20.5bn, was in the first year of a three-year recovery phase.
It had dealt with its commercial lending problems and was well-provisioned
against housing losses.

to put together a portfolio of broadcasting businesses.
Since then the company has decided to sell up and distribute proceeds to
shareholders.
At the same time as buying out TV-am's interest in the new station Virgin
has brought Apax Partners, a venture capital group which will take up a 25
per cent stake in the new station.
Mr Bruce Gyngell, TV-am chairman, will step down as chairman of Virgin
Radio. No price was disclosed for the deal but it is believed Virgin has
paid about Pounds 1.5m.
Recently MTV paid Pounds 3.5m to buy TV-am's headquarters.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Fairey to Pounds 17.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAIREY GROUP, the specialist electronics and engineering company, reported a
19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits last year, helped by recent
acquisitions and a strong performance by its core electronics and electrical
power division.
Pre-tax profits increased by slightly more than expected from Pounds 14.5m
to Pounds 17.3m on sales which expanded 17 per cent to Pounds 104.3m (Pounds
88.8m). Earnings per share climbed 16 per cent to 32.5p (28.1p) out of which
an increased final dividend of 6.9p is proposed, making a total of 10.2p
(9p) for the year.
Mr John Poulter, chief executive, acknowledged that '1992 was a good year
for Fairey, despite the indifferent economic climate'. Overall operating
profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 13.2m).
Operating profits in the electronics and electrical division jumped almost
42 per cent to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 7.56m) including an initial contribution
of about Pounds 1m from the acquisitions. Turnover was Pounds 56.1m (Pounds
39.5m).
In contrast the aerospace and defence division, which has been a shrinking
business over the past five years, reported lower operating profits of
Pounds 2.25m (Pounds 2.45m) on turnover which slipped to Pounds 22.4m
(Pounds 24.2m).
The filtration and specialised ceramics division managed to hold steady in
difficult markets with operating profits of Pounds 2.92m (Pounds 3.17m) on
turnover which edged ahead to Pounds 25.8m (Pounds 25.1m).
Despite spending Pounds 15.6m in cash on acquisitions during the year the
underlying positive cash flow still enabled the group to end the year with
net cash of Pounds 2.1m, down from Pounds 12.7m. a year earlier.
COMMENT
Fairey continues to delight its shareholders. Since coming to market in
November 1988 at 155p the stock has climbed steadily to close up 10p at a
new high of 590p last night. So far the steady performance has been built on
highly selective and well integrated acquisitions, organic growth and a
timely restructuring of the aerospace and defence business. The balance
sheet remains robust and assuming the management is not now tempted to go
for a big acquisition, which would be rather out of character, further
cautious small purchases look likely. If nothing else changes Fairey's
recent acquisitions in the electronics field would add another Pounds 1m to
profits this year, and with more than a third of its business in the US, it
stands to be a beneficiary of both the stronger dollar and any US-led
recovery. Full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 19.5m look possible
producing earnings per share of 34.5p. The stock is trading on a prospective
p/e of 17. It is not not cheap, but it is a quality stock which may not have
reached the top yet.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bristol &amp; West hit by fall in house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL &amp; West Building Society yesterday announced a 42 per cent fall to
Pounds 39.1m in pre-tax profits after it was forced to triple provisions for
possible bad debts on mortgage lending to Pounds 74.1m, writes John Gapper.
The society, the 10th largest by asset size, was affected by the fall in
house prices in the south. The bad debt charge, which rose from Pounds 24.5m
in 1991, cut profits despite a 23 per cent rise in operating profits to
Pounds 113.2m (Pounds 91.9m).
Mr Tony FitzSimons, chief executive, said provisions had risen because the
value of many properties on which the society lent has fallen below the
level at which repossession losses were absorbed by mortgage indemnity
insurance.
Mr FitzSimons said the society anticipated a reduction in its provisions for
this year unless there was 'a significant deterioration' in house prices. It
also expected to raise profits in 1993 barring a worsening of the recession.
The society confirmed it was planning to sell about two thirds of the 160
branches in estate agent chains Hamptons and Bristol &amp; West Property
Services. More will be invested in remaining branches to boost
profitability.
Pre-tax profits in the second half were Pounds 26m, double those in the
first. Mr FitzSimons said they had been 'even stronger than anticipated'
when the society announced half year figures. He said the society's policy
of seeking arrangements with borrowers rather than repossessing had led to a
rise in arrears of over 12 months.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cramphorn helps Wyevale rise to Pounds 3.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON,
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wyevale Garden Centres yesterday announced a 24 per cent jump in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 3.54m for 1992, reflecting the previous year's acquisition
of Cramphorn which made it the UK's largest garden centre company.
Turnover rose from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 34.6m, reflecting the Pounds 16.5m
purchase of Cramphorn in October 1991. Its 15 centres contributed about 44
per cent to the group's 1992 profits and turnover. The group has 41 centres
in total.
The latest profits included Pounds 153,000 from the sale of property during
the year. Year earlier profits were Pounds 2.86m. Operating margins
decreased to 7.2 per cent (7.5 per cent).
The board recommended a final dividend of 1.52p (1.24p), bringing the year's
total to 4p (3.72p). Earnings per share - excluding surplus on sale of
properties - were 7.5p (8.8p).
The group said gross margins were up 0.5 of a percentage point to 46 per
cent. Turnover had improved in the final quarter by 16.5 per cent, after a
4.6 per cent decrease in the third quarter.
Interest payments increased sharply from Pounds 146,000 to Pounds 1.42m
because of the assumption of Cramphorn debt. Gearing, however, fell to 36
per cent from about 37 per cent.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pressure on margins leaves TDG at Pounds
33.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERE PRESSURE on margins hit profits at Transport Development Group which
yesterday reported a 7 per cent decline at the operating level to Pounds
40.5m for the year to December 31.
Mr Martin Llowarch, former British Steel chief executive who took over as
chairman in April, said the squeeze on margins had been most severe in
transport and plant hire. 'These are two areas where it has been pretty
acute in recessionary times,' he said.
The pre-tax performance masked the decline, showing an almost doubled return
of Pounds 33.5m, against Pounds 16.9m. Turnover rose by Pounds 15.2m to
Pounds 599.5m. The strong rise in pre-tax profits was due to the restatement
of 1991 results under new accounting standards. A Pounds 17m charge for
withdrawal from the US had previously been taken as an extraordinary item.
Earnings, similarly restated, rose from 3.6p to 12.05p. The proposed final
dividend is maintained at 6.5p, for an unchanged total of 9.5p.
Mr Llowarch said TDG had experienced good trading in the Netherlands and
Germany. France had been difficult, however, with losses of Pounds 2m in one
subsidiary which wiped out profits from other French businesses.
Mr Llowarch warned that even the previously buoyant parts of continental
Europe were beginning to slow down. 'Transport has been getting more
difficult on the continent than in the UK,' he said.
TDG was taking steps to streamline the management of its European
operations, as it had been doing in Britain for the past two years.
Redundancy costs for 1992 came to about Pounds 2.8m.
Trading continued to be quiet in Britain, with no sign of an upturn.
Operating profits declined from Pounds 32.3m to Pounds 31.8m, although they
were cushioned by an increase in the storage division.
In the US, the group said it was confident of receiving the outstanding
Pounds 10.7m proceeds on the sale of Willig Freight. However, this depended
on the success of a private bond offer by the purchaser, which was expected
to go ahead in the near future.
COMMENT
The gloomy noises coming out of Europe are perhaps one reason for the
shares' decline from 295p to 285p in a buoyant market. There are some who
argue TDG tends to leave the starting gate a bit late when it comes to
strategy. The refocusing has been going on for two years, and is only now
addressing Europe. On the other hand, its strong balance sheet shines at
this point in the recession. What many fear, however, is that the cautious
management will not use that strength aggressively. Forecasts are for flat
profits of about Pounds 36m to Pounds 37m. The prospective p/e of 17.6
leaves the price about right, if not slightly demanding. However, this could
change with economic recovery.

<TEXT>
CALDERBURN, the office furniture manufacturer formed by the merger in July
1991 of Alan Cooper Holdings and Mayfield, yesterday announced pre-tax
profits marginally higher at Pounds 2.83m compared with Pounds 2.77m, for
1992.
Gross margins increased from 9 per cent to 10.6 per cent on turnover down
from Pounds 28.8m to Pounds 26m. Net interest receivable fell to Pounds
68,000 (Pounds 178,000).
The figures were prepared under FRS 3 standards.
The recommended final dividend is 4.9p maintaining the total at 7.7p,
although this is not covered by earnings of 7.4p (8.1p).
The group's Cooper Dauphin office furniture design, manufacturing and
marketing subsidiary, saw a 10 per cent dip in sales from Pounds 21.7m in
1991 to Pounds 19.7m this time.
Unit Press, the office furniture engineering components subsidiary, also saw
a 12.4 per cent reduction in sales to Pounds 7.65m (Pounds 8.6m).
The subsidiary had been successful in opening up new markets in Germany with
its largest customer Dauphin, which is also an investor in the group.
The results were in line with expectations as the group continued to benefit
from its 1991 merger, analysts said.
The company had done well considering the difficult market.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: British Vita ahead to Pounds 55.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH VITA, the polymer, fibre and foam company, yesterday disappointed
the market with pre-tax profits up 9.5 per cent at Pounds 55.2m as
continental Europe slowed sharply.
The shares fell from 253p to 235p.
In the year to December 31, operating profits fell 8.7 per cent to Pounds
48.7m on sales up 14 per cent at Pounds 788.5m.
The profits were flattered by Pounds 2m of currency translation gains and
also benefited from a sharp increase in associated company profits after
losses in Spartech were reduced.
As the proceeds of last year's rights issue were not fully utilised, the
group benefited from Pounds 842,000 interest, compared with a charge of
Pounds 4.6m. Mr Rod Sellers, chief executive, said the results were
'creditable' given the market circumstances. He was particularly pleased
with cash generation, given the deterioration in trading conditions.
Sales in the UK rose to Pounds 253m, but operating profit fell from Pounds
15.9m to Pounds 14.7m. The fall in continental Europe was greater -
operating profits fell from Pounds 35.7m to Pounds 33.3m on sales up 15 per
cent at Pounds 499.4m.
Sales to the industrial and auto sector in Germany were particularly hard
hit by wage rate inflation. Consumer demand for products like mattresses
held up relatively well.
The results were after Pounds 4m losses, including the cost of redundancies
in the Spanish operation which had been hit by a slowing economy and where
losses were continuing this year.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 16.3p, adjusted for the rights issue
last year; a recommended final distribution of 3.65p lifts the total for the
year to 7.15p (7.05p).
COMMENT
With the exception of Reuters, there are few other UK quoted companies more
dependent than British Vita on the weakening European economy. Given the
strength of management and tight working capital control in recession, this
slow down is something investors would be prepared to stomach. What is
really hurting Vita is Spain. The company could easily lose another Pounds
4m this year, redundancy payments for only 57 Spanish workers last year cost
Pounds 2.5m. Until this is sorted out and the scale of the European slowdown
in established, there is little for investors to be chasing. Pre-tax profits
of Pounds 53m this year are likely to give earnings per share of 15.2p and a
prospective multiple of about 15.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BPI in Pounds 8.4m acquisition of rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Polythene Industries, the acquisitive polythene film products maker,
yesterday announced an 18 per cent advance in pre-tax profits for 1992, an
Pounds 8.4m acquisition, and a rights issue to raise Pounds 20.6m.
Pre-tax profits were pushed ahead to Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 10.3m) on turnover
up at Pounds 177.2m (Pounds 156.1m). Some Pounds 400,000 for redundancies
was subtracted giving operating profits of Pounds 14.5m, up 13 per cent.
The company has made eight acquisitions since its Pounds 15.5m rights issue
in 1991. The current one, its ninth, is the business of Sonoco Polysack
Europe from Sonoco, its US parent. Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman and chief
executive, said Sonoco was BPI's biggest competitor in the retail sector. He
said he was not concerned about OFT considerations because of the
customer-driven nature of the business. He said the acquisition would lift
BPI's market share in carrier bags from 16 to 24 per cent.
BPI is to acquire Sonoco's Telford business for Pounds 6.7m cash and the
non-trading Danish subsidiary which owns plant and equipment, for Pounds
1.7m cash. In the year to November 30 the Telford business incurred a
trading loss of Pounds 385,000 (Pounds 1.56m) on turnover of Pounds 12.4m
(Pounds 8m).
The current rights is on a 1-for-6 basis at 405p per ordinary share and 313
ordinary for every 4,000 convertible preference. The shares slipped 4p to
484p. After the acquisition and paying down current borrowings of about
Pounds 22m, BPI will have about Pounds 11m of debt. A final dividend of 6.5p
makes a total of 10p (9p), payable from earnings of 25.82p (23.79p).
COMMENT
The 1-for-6 cash call, rather than, say, 1-for-3 a little later, suggest
that one or two juicy acquisitions could be in the pipeline. And that's on
top of the Sonoco deal which is clearly a logical and positive move. It puts
the very focused BPI, six times larger than its nearest competitor, in a
much stronger strategic position and should be earnings-enhancing. Margins
will improve with the most troublesome competitor out of the way and as
general raw material prices rise. Pre-tax forecasts for 1993 range between
Pounds 14.6m and Pounds 15.5m. If earnings per share are 27p, the multiple
will be 17.5, if 29p, then 16. Investors will have no trouble deciding to
take up their rights in full.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Perkins Foods hit by interest turnround
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GLUT of fresh produce last year and a swing to interest payable cut 1992
pre-tax profits at Perkins Foods by 8.7 per cent to Pounds 22.1m.
However, the final dividend goes up 0.1p to 2.7p, bringing the total to 4.4p
(4.3p). The shares rose 7p to 105p.
Group sales rose 36 per cent to Pounds 353.8m, of which only Pounds 9.2m
came from acquisitions as takeover activity has subsided. Operating profits
were ahead 10.7 per cent at Pounds 23.8m, with Pounds 600,000 coming from
acquisitions.
Mr Howard Phillips, chief executive, said the group had integrated
acquisitions and focused on seven business groups, although it reports
results in four divisions.
An interest charge of Pounds 1.7m compared with receivable of Pounds 2.7m as
sterling cash balances attracted lower interest rates and overseas borrowing
costs rose. Mr Ian Blackburn, finance director, said gearing was 34 per
cent, up from 12 per cent, if the D-Mark convertible loan notes are counted
as debt.
The frozen food division increased operating profits by 33 per cent to
Pounds 14.2m, but this included a Pounds 1.2m insurance payment.
In chilled foods, the only division to achieve organic profit growth,
profits rose 20 per cent to Pounds 4.8m, but this was after a Pounds 1.4m
provision covering the closure of a factory.
Fresh produce profits fell from Pounds 7.6m to Pounds 6.7m, although Mr
Phillips said this was a better result than many competitors had achieved.
Fully diluted earnings per share fell from 11.9p to 9.7p.
COMMENT
Perkins share price has recovered from last year's fall. The group has done
much to allay concerns about the fresh produce division, the lack of
integration of rather hastily acquired businesses, and the balance sheet.
Deferred consideration on acquisitions is beginning to tail off, with Pounds
8.3m paid in 1992 out of a potential Pounds 11m, and a maximum of Pounds
4.3m due in 1993 and another Pounds 5.1m possible over the next four years.
The fall in sterling still raises doubts about the D-Mark convertibles, at
least in the most cynical minds, but the group believes it can cover their
redemptions from D-Mark cashflows if necessary. Forecasts are for a bounce
back to profits of Pounds 25m this year giving a p/e under 10. The historic
yield is still attractive at 5.6 per cent.

FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brierley considers move on Brown Shipley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPG, the UK investment vehicle for Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand
entrepreneur, was last night considering launching a full bid for Brown
Shipley Holdings, the investment and broking group.
Yesterday it increased its stake in BSH to more than 22 per cent, raising
the prospect of a counter-bid to that from BSH's largest shareholder,
Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise. KBL holds 29.8 per cent and last year bought
Brown Shipley &amp; Co, the merchant bank, from BSH in a rescue deal.
KBL is offering 30p a share, valuing BSH at Pounds 4.8m. GPG has paid 35p a
share for the latest 14.8 per cent tranche, which it bought from Mr Giorgio
Rossi.
BSH last night said GPG would have to offer not less than 35p in cash.
Mr Rossi resigned from the board of BSH before the KBL bid was announced. He
bought shares and joined the board in 1986, when the share price ranged
between 400p and 645p. That was also the year KBL took a 20 per cent stake,
for which it paid Pounds 23m.
Mr Rossi, a former Credito Italiano banker who lives in Switzerland, was
once a director and had a 6 per cent stake in Guinness Peat, the forerunner
of GPG which was relisted in November after nearly two years' suspension.
Mr Rossi sold his Guinness Peat stake in 1983. Yesterday his son Francesco,
who works at BSH as a member of the supervisory board, said no connection
remained between his father and GPG.
He added that his father had sold his BSH stake simply because: '35p is more
than 30p. We are very sad to have to take this step. We thought BSH had a
future as an independent company.' The first closing date on Thurdsay for
KBL's offer, which is recommended by the BSH board, comes after a convoluted
series of events.
It made the offer in the wake of its claims against BSH totalling Pounds
2.4m. These arose from the acquisition of Brown Shipley and Co and its
liabilities after the sale of Lease Management Services to Woodchester
Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and banking group.
More than Pounds 1.5m has already been paid to Woodchester out of a total
liability of Pounds 5m.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Prescription for IBM: a new Thomas Watson: The search for a
leader to turn around the ailing computer giant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE deliberations of the directors charged with finding a new leader for the
world's largest computer company have been cloaked in secrecy. Even senior
International Business Machines executives are in the dark. However, the
search for a successor to Mr John Akers remains the favourite topic of
industry gossip.
Seven weeks before a self-imposed deadline, the quest for a new chief
executive appears to be narrowing to a short list of candidates from within
the industry.
Names frequently mentioned include Mr John Sculley, chairman of Apple
Computer, Mr Paul Stern, who resigned as chairman of Northern Telecom just
two days after Mr Akers announced that he would be stepping down at IBM, Mr
Larry Bossidy, chairman of Allied Signal, and Mr James Cannavino, IBM senior
vice-president, the only 'insider'
considered a likely candidate.
When the search committee was established in January, IBM said that it was
seeking the best qualified person - inside or outside the company, and
inside or outside the computer industry. Technical expertise is not seen as
a necessity, the company said.
The most important qualification, IBM says, is that the individual be 'a
proven and effective leader, skilled in managing change'.
The new chief executive of IBM must be able to deliver inspirational
addresses and at the same time cut the workforce by tens of thousands. He
must rebuild the confidence of Wall Street in the company that was long the
bluest of blue chips, but which lately has seen its stock price plunge and
its dividends cut.
Most importantly, he must make customers believe, once again, that IBM can
provide technology that will enhance the performance of their businesses.
Finding somebody able and willing to take on such a challenge will not be
easy. Those who want the job probably underestimate the difficulties, while
those who appreciate the enormity of the task may shrink from it, industry
executives say.
Yet IBM's problems are not unique. Like many smaller companies it has been
overtaken by market and technology trends. IBM's next leader is probably
somebody who has already addressed such problems. He will be a 'change
agent' who commands respect, if not popularity.
Mr Paul Stern made few friends at Northern Telecom and would not be a
popular choice among IBM employees. However, as an ex-IBMer he is said to
understand the company's culture. He is known as a hard-driving manager who
would not flinch from prescribing the drastic surgery that many industry
analysts say IBM must undergo.
Mr John Sculley has told close associates that he has no plans to leave
Apple Computer. However, his recent purchase of a house in Greenwich,
Connecticut, close to IBM's East Coast headquarters, has fuelled the rumour
mill.
According to one former IBM executive, Mr Sculley has engaged consultants to
research IBM's problems so he can make a persuasive presentation to IBM's
selection committee, but associates of Mr Sculley say this is unbelievable.
Apple's alliances with IBM in the personal computer arena have given Mr
Sculley more insight into the workings of IBM than any other 'outside'
candidate. He is also a master of public relations and has a reputation as a
technology "visionary'.
Mr Larry Bossidy of Allied Signal is reported to have made several visits to
IBM's headquarters in recent weeks, firing speculation that he may be in the
running for the top job. At Allied Signal, a diversified industrial
conglomerate, Mr Bossidy has masterminded a broad restructuring and produced
a strong profit rebound.
Mr James Cannavino has long hoped to succeed to the top post at IBM,
according to associates and industry executives. As general manager of IBM's
personal systems division, he was responsible for last year's restructuring
of IBM's personal computer business which is now increasing its market share
after several years of decline. Mr Cannavino is also in charge of IBM's
workstation technology which promises to become the core of the company's
next generation mainframe computers, as well as future personal computers
and hand-held computer devices.
Known within the company as a non-conformist, Mr Cannavino eschews the
buttoned-down style of IBM's top echelon.
He is called the 'outside insider', with a deep understanding of the
company's culture but a strong belief that it must change.
The search committee is headed by Mr James Burke, the retired chairman of
Johnson &amp; Johnson, and includes six people from outside the computer
industry: Mr Thomas Murphy, chairman of Capital Cities/ABC; Mr Stephen
Bechtel, retired chairman of the Bechtel Group; Mr Thomas Frist, chairman of
Hospital Corporation of America; Mr J. Richard Munro, retired co-chairman of
Time Warner; former US Secretary of Defense Mr Harold Brown; and Wellesley
College president Ms Nannerl Keohane.
The committee has hired two executive search firms, Heidrick &amp; Struggles and
Spencer Stuart, to help find a new chief executive.
Industry observers expect IBM to present its new chief executive at the
annual shareholders meeting, scheduled for April 26. That leaves little time
for the selection committee to decide on its candidate, and negotiate terms.
The decision will certainly not be easy.
By announcing its willingness to consider outside candidates, the board has
added to the symbolism of the event.
IBM has not brought in a chief executive from outside its own ranks since
1914, when the company was still called Computing-Tabulating-Recording
Company. The man chosen then - needed, just like today's candidates, to
reinvent a floundering company - was Mr Thomas Watson Sr, the founder of the
modern IBM.
The new chief executive's task will be difficult enough, in all conscience,
without inviting comparison with one of the 20th century's most influential
businessmen. But if he can manage a fraction of Mr Thomas Watson's
achievements, the search committee will have spent its time wisely.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Marc Rich steps down and cuts holding

<TEXT>
MR MARC RICH, the interational commodity trader, is retiring from the big
trading company, Marc Rich &amp; Co, he founded in 1973 and has headed ever
since.
The usually secretive company said in a statement that Mr Rich would also be
reducing his shareholding from more than 50 per cent to 15 per cent within
five years.
Mr Willy Strothotte, a 48-year-old German who left the Zug-based company
last year after what Mr Rich called a 'philosophical difference in
management', is to become chief executive. According to the statement, Mr
Rich was 'very pleased' that Mr Strothotte was returning.
It said Mr Rich's share stake would be reduced to 40 per cent, hopefully
within 90 days. 'The management and a number of employees of the company
will acquire the ownership which is being transferred.'
Mr Rich, a Belgian by birth, founded it in New York in 1973 after leaving
the US commodity trading group, Philipp Brothers (Phibro) in 1973 over a
dispute about his annual bonus.
He soon built it up to a multi-billion dollar business. He said last year it
had turnover of Dollars 30bn in 1991, and net worth of more than Dollars
1bn, placing it second only to the US Cargill group among international
traders. It employs about 1,300 people throughout the world and has some 200
shareholders.
In 1984, in the face of tax evasion, fraud and racketeering charges in the
US, he moved to the Swiss city of Zug where the group had its headquarters.
He still faces criminal charges in the US. In the same year, the Swiss
Federal Banking Commission investigated a loan to the Rich group, and
concluded that the loan, secured on a Rich ship, was designed to prevent the
US authorities from confiscating the ship when it entered US waters.
Evidence of unrest at the group emerged last summer when three senior
executives, including Mr Strothotte, left. Mr Rich scoffed then at
suggestions of retirement. 'I guess I am a business machine, yet I have been
doing this for 40 years. When my original partners retired two years ago the
thought went through my mind: 'Should I retire as well?' But it did not take
me long to decide I love the business and this is what I want to continue to
do.'

FT  09 MAR 93 / Recession aids Intrum Justitia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTRUM Justitia, Europe's largest debt collection agency, pushed up pre-tax
profits 26 per cent to Pounds 16m in the year ended last December in spite
of finding it harder to reclaim money from hard-pressed consumers.
'We get more debtors in recession; but they are less likely to pay back,'
said Ms Gunilla Demnert, finance director.
The recession had seen a 'big increase' in work related to higher income
debtors within its consumer-debt portfolio, which accounts for nearly a
third of the company's turnover.
'The AB social classes are much better debtors than the CDs,' Ms Demnert
added. Consequently, the group hopes for a significant upturn when recovery
gets under way.
The Dutch-based but London listed company handled 3m new cases across Europe
in 1992, up 20 per cent on 1991; its stock of cases at the year end was
2.6m, an increase of 24 per cent. But the average handling time for consumer
collection cases was 9 per cent longer than in 1991 at 10.9 months, and the
recovery success rate was down from 23 per cent to 21 per cent. Debts
pursued by the company averaged about Pounds 500.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 16m compared with Pounds 12.6m a year earlier
under the new FRS 3 accounting rules. Turnover on continuing operations rose
by 5.6 per cent to Pounds 80.8m. Including Pounds 4.47m income from a French
acquisition made last year, and Pounds 3.64m from a release of provision,
total turnover was up 16.2 per cent. Earnings per share rose to 9.2p (from
9.1p). A final dividend of 2p a share is proposed, taking the total for the
year to 3p (from 2.4p).
With net borrowings of Pounds 16.6m at the year-end, gearing was steady at
27 per cent.
Mr Bo Goranson, chief executive, said that after several years of
acquisition-led growth, the company intended to consolidate. But with half
of Intrum Justitia's turnover generated in Scandinavia, he added that growth
potential was 'immense'. The UK, with 29 per cent of turnover, is its next
highest earner.
The Pounds 3.6m release of provision followed a legal ruling in Sweden
confirming the company's full fee entitlement for written-off debt
surveillance cases, which reduced the risk of them being withdrawn by
clients.

FT  09 MAR 93 / ICI clears way for Zeneca issue by settling US patent
dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries and Barr Laboratories, the New-York-based
generics group, have settled a drugs patent dispute in a move that helps
clear the way for ICI's wholly-owned subsidiary Zeneca to make its Pounds
1.3bn rights issue in June.
ICI and Barr have reached an out-of-court settlement concluding a dispute
over the US patents for Nolvadex, Zeneca's best-selling breast cancer drug.
Last April, ICI's Nolvadex patents were invalidated by a US southern
district court of New York. It decided irregularities in filing for the US
patent for Nolvadex had made the patent unenforceable. ICI was appealing.
The court's decision put Nolvadex's US annual sales of about Dollars 265m
(Pounds 186m) at risk. The patents were supposed to run for another nine
years. Recent US patent expiries - including that of ICI's heart drug
Tenormin - have been followed by sales falling as much 50 per cent over 12
months, as generic manufacturers undercut the price of the previously
patented brand.
The two groups have now agreed to dismiss all claims raised in the action.
Both have acknowledged there was a substantial possibility that the drug's
US patents would have been held valid and enforceable. The drug's US patents
are scheduled to expire in 2002. They have expired in other countries.
Under the agreement, ICI will pay Dollars 21m to Barr. The US group will
enter a non-exclusive distributorship agreement with Zeneca and will start
selling the drug from November 1. ICI indicated the price the medicine would
be sold to Barr would not allow the US company to undercut Nolvadex's
existing price substantially.
ICI announced last month that it was to spin off Zeneca, its
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and speciality chemicals subsidiary. The
demerger needs to be confirmed in May by an extraordinary general meeting.
Barr is also challenging Wellcome, the UK group, over the validity of its
patents for AZT, the HIV-treatment.
Glaxo, Europe's biggest drugs group, yesterday announced it had been
notified by the UK's Medicines Control Agency that its new inhaled steroid
asthma treatment Fluticasone had been given a product licence. The decision
increases the likelihood of the drug receiving licences from other
regulatory bodies.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Spain threatens delay to EEA free-trade treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN UPSET its 11 European Community partners yesterday by threatening to
delay ratification of the European Economic Area, the treaty creating a free
trade area of 370m people from the Arctic to the Mediterranean.
Signalling growing frustration with the delay in ratification of the
Maastricht treaty, Spain announced a 'go-slow' on parliamentary approval of
the EEA.
Mr Carlos Westendorp, a senior Spanish diplomat, told reporters that the
Spanish parliament would wait until after the November elections to complete
EEA ratification.
The unilateral Spanish declaration caused consternation at a meeting of EC
foreign ministers in Brussels. EC delegations had hoped to secure a joint
commitment to ratify the EEA treaty between the EC and the European Free
Trade Association in all 18 countries by July 1.
Mr Westendorp implied the delay was linked to the hold-up in approval of the
Maastricht treaty in Denmark and the UK.
He said: 'July 1 is not a realistic date. Some of us are going to take a
good deal longer, not least because we (the EC) have the Maastricht treaty
to deal with.'
The majority view in Brussels last night was that the EEA would still come
into force this year. 'July 1 was never a realistic deadline,' said a Dutch
diplomat.
Spain's move cast a shadow over efforts to repair the damage to the EEA
caused by Switzerland's rejection of the treaty in a referendum last
December.
It could jeopardise a hard-fought compromise under which the other six Efta
members will contribute between 60 and 70 per cent of Switzerland's expected
contribution to the EC's poorest countries - Greece, Ireland, Spain and
Portugal.
The new protocol on these so-called 'cohesion funds' was already weighted
heavily in favour of the Community.
Spain's threat to delay ratification could complicate enlargement
negotiations with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway, the four Efta
countries which hoped to to join the EC by 1995, Brussels diplomats said.
Finland is thought to be unhappy with the deal on Switzerland's contribution
to cohesion funds because it risks encouraging Mediterranean countries, led
by Spain, to bargain harder for Nordic concessions in the enlargement
negotiations.
A senior Efta diplomat added it might be difficult to justify the increased
payments to Nordic voters who are already sceptical about the benefits of EC
membership.
The new agreement says that interest rate rebates provided by the six Efta
members will be reduced from 3 per cent to 2 per cent. Switzerland was due
to contribute 27 per cent of the Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.6bn) cohesion fund, split
between Ecu1.5bn in loans and Ecu500m in grants.
Diplomats noted yesterday, however, that the EEA deal covering farm products
comes into force on April 15 and will not depend on ratification of the new
EEA protocol - a concession which substantially benefits Spain.

FT  09 MAR 93 / British talks with PLO prompt Israeli protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL last night summoned the British ambassador to protest at the UK's
decision to resume top-level contacts with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation which were broken off following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990.
Mr Yossi Beilin, the deputy foreign minister, said that the action 'might
harm the chances to resume the peace process' in the Middle East. An Israeli
foreign ministry statement described the move as 'a prize for the
Palestinians who have yet to announce their readiness to return to the
process'.
British officials were dismayed at the reaction and stressed that the
decision was taken solely to assist the peace process.
The break in relations between the PLO and Britain was in protest at the
organisation's support for Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. Britain has
hinted for some time that the ban on top-level contacts was under review.
Mr Douglas Hogg, a minister of the Foreign Office, will today meet Mr Faisal
Husseini, the leading Palestinian in the Arab territories occupied by
Israel; Mr Afif Safieh, head of the PLO delegation in London, and an
official from PLO headquarters in Tunis. On Thursday Mr Hogg will meet Mr
Beilin.
The Foreign Office said: 'The peace process is at a delicate stage. We are
urging all sides to agree to an early resumption of negotiations. The PLO
will have an influence on important decisions.'
The PLO has warned that it cannot resume peace negotiations with Israel
until substantial progress has been made towards resolving the crisis over
the 396 Palestinians deported by Israel to southern Lebanon in December.
A visit last month to the region by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary
of state, failed to overcome the obstacle but he is expected soon to issue
formal invitations for a resumption of negotiations in Washington during the
second half of April. Syria, Lebanon and Jordan have all expressed their
willingness to attend.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Additional Pounds 1bn of government services face market
tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER Pounds 1bn of government work could be opened up to competition
from the private sector, under an initiative from Mr William Waldegrave, the
public services minister.
Sir Peter Levene, head of the prime minister's efficiency unit, has begun
talks with officials over the new tranche of market-testing which is set to
affect public bodies in addition to Whitehall departments.
The new round will include quangos - public bodies which are separate from
Whitehall. 'This goes right the way through government,' one official said
yesterday. Executive agencies, which operate at arm's length from
departments, and the departments themselves, are already subject to
market-testing.
Officials will discuss whether areas such as legal or accounting services
currently carried out by their own departments or by their departments'
quangos could be done better or more cheaply by the private sector. Mr
Waldegrave hopes to make an announcement in the autumn.
Last October, Mr Waldegrave announced that about Pounds 1.5bn of services
would be tested against the private sector this year, and his department is
aiming for Pounds 1bn-Pounds 2bn worth to be tested next year. Despite
complications that have arisen in some areas of contracted out services,
because of EC legislation designed to protect the rights of workers in
takeovers and mergers, ministers are determined to press ahead with the
programme.
While Mr Waldegrave is heading the initiative, the Treasury is also
involved, seeing it as a way of improving value for money, and thus part of
the fundamental review of public spending announced last month.
In particular, the Treasury will press for testing to be extended in areas
where the private sector can definitely compete, rather than areas where
there is no real market or expertise outside government.
Among the quangos already moving down this route is the Housing Corporation,

FT  09 MAR 93 / Italian cabinet to debate action over corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE AMATO government will today decide whether to submit to parliament
controversial legislation on illicit funding of Italian political parties or
to adopt a new approach to dealing with the issue of corruption.
Prime minister Giuliano Amato also has to convince Mr Carlo Ripa de Meana to
reconsider his weekend decision to resign as environment minister, or find a
replacement at a time when the four-party coalition is increasingly
fractious.
'The government tried to carry out something which has wounded the
commonsense of Italians,' Mr Ripa de Meana said yesterday, explaining his
resignation. 'I don't see how this government can continue.'
Another question mark was raised over the Amato government yesterday when Mr
Giovanni Conso, the justice minister appointed less than three weeks ago,
said he had considered resigning over the issue. The government's increased
weakness follows near-universal hostility to a decree approved on Friday
which depenalises illicit funding of political parties and removes party
finances from magistrates' jurisdiction, except in cases of extortion.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro refused to sign the decree on Sunday.
Mr Scalfaro's move was made on constitutional grounds, but he implicitly
invited the prime minister to reconsider the legislation, or at least his
legislative approach.
He said clear conflict existed between the decree, which had to be endorsed
or rejected in its entirety within 60 days, and a referendum on April 18 to
consider the abolition of political parties' public funding.
Mr Amato can opt to leave the text of the decree intact and submit it to
parliament. In this way parliament would be free to alter its provisions and
achieve the compromise originally intended - to balance the need to speed
the judicial process of those involved in corruption proceedings with
perhaps a form of limited amnesty, while paying deference to the
independence of the judiciary.
But with some 50 parliamentarians under investigation, and the main parties
clearly implicated in an institutionalised system of corruption, opposition
deputies yesterday doubted that the present legislature had the legitimacy
to act. The mood of parliament will be clearer today when a general debate
on corruption is held.
A decision is also due on whether to waive immunity for Mr Bettino Craxi,
former Socialist leader, to face charges of alleged corruption and
extortion.
Milan magistrates, at the centre of the investigations, yesterday welcomed
Mr Scalfaro's refusal to sign the decree.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The irony of the government fiddling the stock market following the arrest
of a senior politician for financial irregularities seems to have escaped
the Japanese authorities. There was, however, a little more to yesterday's
sharp rally in Tokyo than simple manipulation. NTT's shares have rallied by
nearly 30 per cent in the last week on the hope that the phone company would
be allowed to increase its tariffs.
But the most important influence is probably a fear that institutions will
be left behind in a liquidity-driven rally. Short term rates are now at a
record low and bond yields have fallen to 4 per cent. Those who bought
high-yield foreign bonds in an effort to boost returns have had their
fingers burned by the yen's strength. However much they hate the idea,
investors are being dragged back to equities as one of the few assets which
offers even the faint prospect of capital gains.
Of course, it is easy to construct a negative case. The economy is still in
decline and the government's Keynesian packages will only offset a fall in
private sector output this year. The moth-eaten balance sheets of corporate
Japan will take years to repair. Operational restructuring has barely begun.
With earnings depressed, share ratings are again sky high. Yet, as in London
and New York, the weight of money could prove too much. And with such strong
forces pulling on the market, Tokyo's recent stability looks like a very
unstable equilibrium.

FT  09 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Glaxo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of Glaxo's vulnerability that the repetition of an
already-known story should send the shares sliding against a rising market.
That the US regulator has asked Glaxo to withdraw claims made for Zantac,
its big selling anti-ulcer drug, is embarrassing. But regulatory raps for
over-zealous marketing are not uncommon. Asking the company to write to
doctors clarifying the position is the usual sanction. Glaxo was forced to
do as much in the UK last year over claims made for its respiratory drug
Serevent. Unless the company is foolhardy enough to stand its ground without
supporting medical data, the spat should not escalate into a more damaging
disagreement.
The episode might weaken Glaxo's defence of Zantac in the US next year
against generic competition. Since the drug accounts for nearly half Glaxo's
sales and a rather higher proportion of profits, that is legitimate cause
for concern. Some of the therapeutic benefits which are used to justify
Zantac's premium price have been called into question by the regulator. With
the US healthcare industry in a penny-pinching mood, that could tip the
balance in favour of cheaper alternatives. The threat is not new, but Glaxo
has to prove it can ride out the challenge.
In happier times, though, that would not send the shares into a spin. Even
UK approval for a new asthma drug yesterday could not lift the gloom. With
the market more interested in cyclical stocks - and while the shape of US
healthcare reform remains unclear - buying Glaxo on good news is likely to
remain a thankless task.

It may be just as well that the government will present two budgets this
year. Yesterday's consumer credit figures add to the impression that the
economy has at last begun to grow. Yet the recovery is not secure enough to
give the chancellor much leeway for fiscal tightening next week. If he wants
to nurture confidence, he will probably still have to wait until November
before setting about any serious deficit reduction.
Much of January's increase in consumer lending appears to reflect the
turnround in car sales since the abolition of car tax. Stripping that out
leaves a modest rise in credit card borrowing which hardly amounts to a
broad-based revival in consumers' appetite for credit. Nor is there much
reason to expect confidence to recover strongly while unemployment is still
rising and there has been no definitive pick-up in the housing market.
Mr Lamont thus still faces the difficult task of convincing financial
markets that the PSBR is under control without trampling any green shoots in
the process. The least the markets require is a medium term plan for
reducing the deficit with some net tax increase now as a gesture of good
faith. Backbench Tory opinion seems to be moving in support of such an
approach. Whether consumers will be happy is another matter. It is a pity
the chancellor has been so emphatic on interest rates. Another rate cut
would not be fully passed on in the mortgage market. But companies would
feel the benefit in their cash flow. That might make them less inclined to
shed staff.

GOLD was fixed at Dollars 327.50 a troy ounce on the London bullion market
after a fixing session stretching over 40 minutes following US fund selling
on Comex and to a lesser extent in London, dealers said. The fix and
subsequent trading edged gold just below the Dollars 328-Dollars 330 an
ounce range which had become well established in the past couple of weeks.
Some analysts believe the market could now slip through the Dollars 320s if
stop-loss selling continues in the absence of resolute buying. Three-month
COPPER moved above Dollars 2,150 a tonne on the LME, helped by trends in New
York, where sentiment has been lifted by the recent positive US employment
report. Three-month ALUMINIUM moved below Dollars 1,180 a tonne, while
three-month NICKEL moved above Dollars 6,000 a tonne. London COCOA edged
ahead on the absence of the selling which pushed May below Pounds 700 a
tonne last week. Last week's Geneva negotiations on an international
agreement were already discounted.

Azerbaijan's oil minister has begun talks in Ankara that will focus on
proposals to build a pipeline to Turkey's Mediterranean coast, according to
a Turkish official, reports Reuter. He said Azeri oil minister Mr Sabit
Bagirov would meet Turkish foreign minister Mr Hikmet Cetin and officials
from the state pipeline company Botas. Talks on piping Azeri oil to Turkey's
Yumurtalik terminal had so far been positive and a statement would be made
next Monday, he added. One problem has been the choice of route. Turkish
officials say the Azeris do not want a pipeline to pass through Armenia
because of the war in Azerbaijan's Armenian-dominated enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US smelters' power supply
problem may continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DROUGHT-induced electricity shortage that has cut aluminium production in
the Pacific north-west US by about 25 per cent may continue through this
year, causing smelters to scramble to find alternative power sources or keep
production capacity mothballed. With world aluminium supplies burdensome,
the output reductions are not likely to support prices, but the economic
impact on the region and individual producers is significant.
The Bonneville Power Administration, the federal agency that markets
electricity from more than 30 dams in the Northwest has began 'temporary'
energy curtailments to to aluminium producers on January 16. Now, with
spring thaws approaching, and water levels rising, power officials and
aluminium industry executives say the situation may not improve to the point
where it pays to restart closed aluminium pot lines.
'I expect current power supply problems will last at least until the end of
this year,' said Mr John Carr, executive director of Direct Service
Industries, the organisation that represents eight aluminium companies and
other industrial users arranging power contracts with Bonneville.
Of eight aluminium companies in the region, two, Reynolds and Vanalco, did
not cut production after the announcement. Reynolds' Troutdale smelter was
already shut in response to low prices, leaving power available to its
second plant. Privately-owned Northwest Aluminum is buying higher-cost
alternative power to maintain output. However, since January, Kaiser
Aluminum's two smelters have reduced annual capacity by about 68,000 tonnes,
the Alumax unit of Amax has cut output by 68,000 tonnes, Alcoa's is down
about 42,000 tonnes, and Columbia Ventures and Columbia Falls aluminium have
each pared output by more than 40,000 tonnes.
Mr Jack Speers, power manager at Alcoa, said Bonneville might have power
available to provide full service to smelters for 8 to 10 weeks in late
April and May, the annual 'fish flush' period when dams release water to
sustain Salmon migration. However, with the cost of restarting a pot line
around Dollars 1m and no assurance that full power will be available through
the summer, 'it's unlikely that we would bring potlines up again,' he said.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uniform CIS pipeline rules
urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER Soviet Union must agree uniform rules covering its oil pipeline
network or billions of dollars of western investment in the country's oil
industry will be jeopardised, according to a report by the World Bank.
'Transport issues are first and foremost in deciding western investment. It
is crucial that a regime is worked out,' said Mr Richard Hildahl, pipeline
expert from Ernst and Young in San Francisco and one of the report's
authors.
Western companies such as Chevron, British Petroleum and Amoco are
considering expenditure of at least Dollars 10bn on pipeline links to export
oil from joint ventures in former Soviet republics, but they need a stable
framework for transport to be agreed in advance.
The break-up of the Soviet Union means that the republics control each part
of the national pipeline network that runs across their territory. This
leads to varying tariffs for oil transport, increased bureaucracy and
frequent rows between republics over payment.
Russia has recently finalised a deal after a bitter dispute with the Ukraine
over the gas pipeline that runs to western Europe over the Ukraine.
Mr Hildahl stresses that it would be fairly easy for the republics to agree
a common framework in which the pipeline system could operate.
The World Bank recommendations will be presented to Russia's Ministry of
Fuel and Power, Transneft, the pipeline company, and all of the republics
next month.
The report strongly advocates the creation of joint-stock companies for each
republic's transit system. In this way, the republics could then swap shares
in their local pipeline network for shares in Russia's Transneft. The
cross-shareholdings would mean the transportation system starts to operate
as more of an integrated network.
This would have to be backed up by regulation of transit prices and
investment plans in order to secure as much flexibility in the system as
possible.
In addition, local companies that have difficulties securing payment of
transit tariffs from oil producers and refiners would be allowed to sell
part of the oil in the pipeline as payment.
Mr Hildahl also points out that local pipeline associations must have assets
such as pumping stations and property rights transferred to them.
The World Bank is expected to make its recommendations contingent on further
aid for oil projects in the former Soviet Union.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Supply-demand worries push oil
prices lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ACTIVE OIL market pushed prices for North Sea Brent crude down by 25
cents yesterday to Dollars 19.20 a barrel for April delivery as traders
worried about low demand and high output.
The monthly oil report from the International Energy Agency, the west's oil
watchdog, provided the focus for market fears and triggered a sell-off.
The report highlighted the weakness of oil demand by pointing to an increase
of only 100,000 barrels a day in OECD consumption in the first quarter - a
rise of only 0.5 per cent compared with the same period last year.
At the same time, the IEA estimated that production by the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries rose to 25.35m b/d in February from 25.2m b/d
in January. Opec has agreed to cut output to 23.58m b/d from the beginning
of this month.
Within the Opec production forecasts, traders were concerned at the high
level of Iranian output, estimated to have reached 3.8m b/d last month, with
Kuwait pumping 1.7m b/d.
Oil prices have risen by at least Dollars 1 a barrel in the past few weeks
as Opec has reasserted its commitment to cut production. 'We've travelled
some distance on the back of rhetoric, but I don't think we've broken down
yet,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, who runs Smith Barney's energy desk in London.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: FAO cuts estimate of tropical
forest loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN's Food and Agriculture organisation has reduced its estimate of the
rate at which tropical forests were being cut down in the 1980s. But it
still puts the annual loss at a much higher level than at the start of the
decade.
The FAO's new estimate of 15.4m hectares a year is down from the interim
figure of 16.9m ha presented to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro last
year, but well above the 11.4m ha of 1980. It now estimates that the area
lost between 1981 and 1990 was 154m ha, leaving 1.75bn ha, or 37 per cent of
the planet, covered in tropical forest.
Most of the loss is attributed to population growth and rural poverty,
resulting in land clearance for agriculture. The organisation estimates that
at least 10m ha a year will have to be cleared for agriculture because of
population pressures up to the year 2050.
Worldwide re-afforestation is put at only 18m ha for the whole of the 1980s.
In Europe the forested area is put at 149m ha, up from 137m ha in 1980.

pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
OLIVE OIL producers and consumers are meeting in Geneva this week to agree a
five-year extension to the 1986 International Agreement on Olive Oil and
Table Olives. The existing United Nations accord, which is designed to
foster development of the industry and has no price stabilisation
provisions, expires at the end of this year.
The draft protocol to extend the agreement was approved last November by the
Madrid-based International Olive Oil Council, and is not controversial. The
nine members of the accord - Algeria, Cyprus, the European Community, Egypt,
Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey and the former Yugoslavia - account for
more than 96 per cent of world exports of olive oil and 87 per cent of world
exports of table olives.
The EC is by far the biggest producer, consumer and exporter of olive oil,
with Greece, Italy and Spain accounting for three-quarters of world output
and half world exports. Since the early 1980s, Spain has displaced Italy as
the biggest EC exporter, with a third of world exports, but outside the EC
it is matched by Tunisia which also has a one-third export share.
Spain is the biggest producer and exporter of table olives, with 45 per cent
of world exports, followed by Morocco with 24 per cent.
The EC also imports large quantities of olive oil and table olives,
accounting for 30 per cent of world olive oil imports - but the US is close
behind.
Olive oil makes up 6 per cent by volume of all fluid edible vegetable oil
traded but represents 23 per cent by value (including intra-EC trade). Olive
oil prices rose sharply between 1985-86 and 1990-91, declining slightly in
1991-92.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tractor registrations fall
another 6.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRACTOR registrations in the UK fell 6.4 per cent last year to a historic
low of 14,296, further underlining the extreme concern of Britain's farmers
over their future, according to the London-based Corporate Intelligence
Group.
Last year's total compared with 15,280 in 1991, and with 39,703 when the
market peaked in 1968. The figures are produced by the Agricultural
Equipment Association.
The group said the market held up better in livestock areas such as the West
Midlands and Wales. This was because the dairy industry was in a period of
great change, with some farmers building themselves a future with the latest
equipment, while others were leaving the industry.
'In the long term there will certainly be many fewer producers in the UK,
but in the short term the level of investment in machinery is quite high,'
said the group.
Beef producers were also reasonably confident about slightly higher prices
this year because of the UK's position within the EC's system of supports
for beef rearing. Eastern England and Yorkshire, where cereals are dominant,
showed the biggest falls in tractor registrations last year.
The trend in favour of larger tractors continued with farmers 'trading up'
to save labour.
Registrations in the 101-120 hp range rose 14.1 per cent to 1,878, while the
71-80 hp category fell 24.7 per cent to 2,399. 'Simple replacement with a
machine of the same size but featuring a smarter cab is a luxury of the
past,' said the group. 'Every pound spent has to be carefully considered.'

FT  09 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pound's slide brings arable
bonanza - The transformed outlook for some UK farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEVALUATION of the 'green pound' by more than 20 per cent since
September has transformed the outlook for profit on UK arable farms this
year, more than wiping out the effect of reforms to the European Community's
common agricultural policy.
Figures given at a London conference last month - before last week's further
1.3 per cent devaluation of the green pound - showed that a 200-hectare
(500-acre) mainly cereal farm getting average yields, which earned Pounds
18,000 before CAP reform, had been facing a drop in income to only Pounds
7,000 this year. But the UK's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism
and the subsequent devaluation of the pound had pushed prospective earnings
up to about Pounds 32,000.
The figures given for a similar-sized farm achieving above average yields
were Pounds 38,000 before CAP reform, Pounds 13,000 after and Pounds 45,000
since devaluation.
Mr Bill Hall, head of the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service,
described the figures as 'quite remarkable'. Farms that had been querying
their viability had seen their profit prospects jump fourfold, he told the
conference.
Under the CAP reforms, aid is being switched to area payments while
intervention prices are cut. The green pound system is used to convert EC
support prices, which are set in European currency units, into national
currencies. In the past the green rate was set each year by EC farm
ministers, but since the advent of the Single European Market on January 1
it is being revised at the end of each month.
Mr Andrew Mason, managing director of Sentry, a farm management company with
44,000 acres under its control, believed the devaluation had created a
unique 'window of opportunity' for the UK farmers. 'We have a one to two
year period when profitability for UK arable agriculture has increased very
substantially,' he said.
He outlined the increased prices he was expecting sector by sector. The
market value of oilseeds had risen from Pounds 100 to Pounds 140 a tonne,
while the EC acreage payment had risen from Pounds 155 to Pounds 185. Basic
feed wheat was selling for Pounds 93 a tonne in September; now it was
fetching Pounds 103 a tonne, while the acreage payment had gone from Pounds
47 to Pounds 55. The market price of pulses had moved from Pounds 90 to
nearly Pounds 110, while the acreage payment was up to Pounds 155 from
Pounds 125.
Sentry will also be setting aside 8 per cent of its land, equal to 15 per
cent of its grain area, and is expecting about Pounds 100 an acre for 3,000
acres.
'We were already making a profit,' said Mr Mason. 'Now we expect a 20 to 25
per cent rise in our margins this year, with cost increases basically nil.
The seeds were there, the fertiliser was paid for at a fixed price and
contracts were signed.'
Sentry, which made Pounds 800,000 on turnover of about Pounds 5m last year,
predicts profits this year of Pounds 1.1m. Mr Mason attributed half the
increase to the green pound and half to expansion and improved efficiency.
Booker Farming, with 50,000 acres farmed and managed, estimated last month
that a 500-acre farm's profits would be bolstered from Pounds 17,474 to
Pounds 33,474 through the green pound effect.
Mr Malcolm McAllister, managing director, warned, however, that by 1995 the
same farm's earnings would be down to just under Pounds 19,000 as the CAP
reforms began to bite and the inflationary pressure on inputs came through.
'The costs of the pound will eventually hit agriculture very very hard.'
The importance of the currency factor is illustrated by Booker Farming's
decision this year for the first time to hedge the Ecu against the pound.
'We have locked in half our area aid payments, including set-aside,' Mr
McAllister said.
Farming is becoming a very detailed business, with computers as necessary as
tractors. Sentry has computerised records for every input in every field -
routine at this level of the business.
But it is now as important to watch currency fluctuations as the weather.
'Profits will be extremely dependent on the way the pound moves. Until we
either rejoin the ERM or some other mechanism volatility is going to be
there in the prices we achieve,' said Adas's Mr Hall. EC payments are
dependent on the level of the pound on July 1.
It was inevitable that producers would have to cope with more ups and downs
than they had been used to, Mr Hall warned. He also foresaw further reforms
to the CAP - perhaps an increase in the amount of land to be set aside.
Such pressure would lead to an increase in contract farming with companies
like Booker, which took 25 per cent more land last year. Mr Hall said
farmers had to realise that contractors could look after a farm at Pounds 80
to Pounds 100 an acre. 'That is the bottom line comparison if you want to be
competitive.'
Mr McAllister said farm owners were turning to contracting to eliminate the
risk of running their own enterprise and guarantee a forecastable income.
For those who wanted to remain independent he warned that this year's
expected windfall profit should not be seen as an opportunity to spend too
much on reinvestment. 'You are immediately raising costs, even though the
interest rates are low, by taking on a lot more depreciation. I would say
don't - use the money to restructure your business.'
Mr Mason also warned against complacency. 'The message is you have an
opportunity to put yourself right. But be quick - it's going to get very
much harder very quickly.'

FT  09 MAR 93 / Snub to the establishment: The message of protest from
voters in the German state of Hesse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bjorn Engholm, the pipe-smoking intellectual who heads Germany's
opposition Social Democrats, is prone at the best of times to more than a
touch of pessimism.
Yesterday he had good reason to be miserable.
His party, which should be riding high in popular esteem, as the ruling
coalition, headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, totters
into a deepening economic recession, had just received a terrible snub from
the voters of the prosperous west German state of Hesse.
And it looked as if the prime beneficiaries were the far-right, racist
Republicans, a party of neo-Nazi inclinations which has so far remained just
on the right side of the law.
In local elections for all the city, town and local authorities of the
state, including the gleaming business and banking centre of Frankfurt, the
SPD suffered an 8.4 per cent slump in its vote, down from 44.8 to 36.4 per
cent since the last local poll in 1989.
Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats
did little better: from a disastrous low of 34.3 per cent back in 1989, the
party lost a further 2.3 per cent.
As for the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the Bonn government, they
only managed a paltry 5.1 per cent of the votes.
It was a resounding snub for the entire political establishment in Bonn. And
yesterday it unleashed a predictable round of soul-searching and bickering.
The winners were all on the extremes: not merely the far-right Republicans;
also the left-wing, environmentalist Greens; and the biggest party of all,
the non-voters.
The Republicans, who only stood in two small council districts at the last
elections in 1989, managed to grab 8.3 per cent of the poll overall. In
Frankfurt city, with the largest immigrant population in the country
(roughly 26 per cent), they won 9.5 per cent of the votes, and in one of the
most depressed inner-city areas, no less than 14 per cent.
As for the Greens, the minority
partner in the Hesse government with the SPD, they also benefited
significantly from the mood of disillusionment with the political
establishment, pushing up their share of the vote from 9.1 to 11 per cent.
The turnout was down by 6.7 per cent, from 78 to 71.3 per cent: a result
which would have delighted local election officials in other European
countries, but which is regarded with gloom in Germany.
The same mood of despair has been true across the political spectrum of
political comment, with the notable exception of the unflappable Chancellor
Kohl.
Mr Engholm was in little doubt about the meaning of the vote: 'This result
is an expression of a deep crisis of confidence towards the two great
popular parties,' he said, referring to his own SPD and Mr Kohl's CDU. 'We
must ask what future, and in what circumstances, the two big parties will
have.'
He even went so far as to express concern - 'not a little concern, but
great concern' - over the stability of the German democratic state.
Across the road at the CDU headquarters, the chancellor was more sanguine.
He reminded his audience that they had all cried doom in 1989, and yet he
had come back to win the unification election in 1990. And he restated his
absolute conviction that the far-right Republicans will not win a single
seat in the German Bundestag when it comes to the national elections next
year.
Given the international reaction of horror to the slightest hint of a
revival of nationalism and neo-Nazism, as well as the domestic
soul-searching, how can Mr Kohl be so cool?
He may be wrong, but there are indications that the right-wing revival has
peaked. In neighbouring Baden-Wurttemberg last April, the Republicans
shocked the establishment by polling no less than 10.9 per cent across the
state.
They might have been expected to do even better in Frankfurt with its high
immigrant population. The National-Democratic party (NPD), the Republicans'
predecessor as standard-bearer of the far right, already polled 6.6 per cent
in Frankfurt in 1989, before the latest wave of immigration was under way.
Today the NPD has faded to an insignificant rump. The Republicans themselves
have seen their support drop sharply in the past three months, as tens of
thousands of Germans have demonstrated against attacks on foreigners.
The fear of the political establishment with regard to the Republicans,
headed by Mr Franz Schonhuber, a former SS officer, is that they may succeed
in making themselves salonfahig or, roughly translated, 'house-trained'.
Then it may become acceptable for more disgruntled electors to vote for
them.
In the meantime, however, they are a symptom of protest against the creaking
consensus politics of Bonn, against rising unemployment, the inadequacy of
housing, and the pressures of immigration on west Germany's prosperous
lifestyle. They are not yet a coherent political movement.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Leading Article: A system on trial
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE CLEAR lesson has so far emerged from the contagion of corruption
currently being exposed in Italy: the disease in the country's body politic
runs so deep that none of the physicians in attendance can offer a
satisfactory course of treatment, let alone a viable cure. Not the
magistracy, which has been busily accusing and incarcerating politicians,
officials and businessmen in recent weeks. Not the parliament, more and more
of whose members are being caught in the net. And certainly not the
government of Mr Giuliano Amato, which last Friday proposed a 'political
solution' to the crisis, only to be accused all round of seeking to protect
the guilty from justice.
The affair has brought the Italian ruling class into disrepute, the
government to the brink of collapse, and the country's public works to a
virtual standstill. But it would be hard to pretend that anything resembling
justice is yet being done. Many of the accused are being held in jail
without charge, and the allegations against them are being treated as a
presumption of guilt.
Moreover, there is no chance of any of them being brought speedily to trial.
Italy's judicial system is notoriously slow and inefficient: cases regularly
take six to 10 years to grind through the courts. Endless litigation will
scarcely hasten the reform and strengthening of Italian politics and
society: instead there is a danger that the country's political
establishment will be decapitated and its institutions paralysed at a time
of maximum public ferment.
In view of this, it is understandable that the politicians have been
fumbling for a 'political solution'. The plan adopted by Mr Amato's cabinet
last Friday would retroactively change the law on party financing, nexus of
most of the corruption scandals, turning the payment of illicit
contributions to party coffers from a crime punishable by prison to a mere
misdemeanour, with fines and other civil penalties attached. The result -
just as predictably - was uproar among opposition parties, magistrates and
the public.
The cabinet's measures were not entirely without merit. It is clear, for
example, that the authorities will have to draw some form of distinction
between criminal and merely illicit forms of graft if they are to avoid
filling Italy's prisons to bursting point. Yet attempting at this point to
tamper with the judicial system was an act of astonishing political
insensitivity on the government's part: the public is behind the magistracy
and in no mood to see politicians letting each other off.
Italians sense that they are witnessing an indictment of the whole way their
country has run its affairs for decades. The judiciary - not the politicians
 -should respond by taking corruption prosecutions out of the existing,
overtaxed court system and creating a special legal structure under
respected judges to expedite them. This the politicians should agree to
fund. Meanwhile, the latter, for their part, should inject greater urgency
into their deliberations on electoral reform, the subject of a referendum on
April 18, with a view to holding early elections shortly thereafter. Only
then can a new parliament and a more legitimate government set about
agreeing the constitutional reforms that Italy so badly needs.

Whatever else the indebted First National Finance Corporation may lack, it
is not short of bankers on its board of directors.
Martin Mays-Smith, who took over as chairman a year ago, is an ex-Kleinwort
Benson man, Tim Ingram, the new finance director, is a career banker, and
three of FNFC's four non-executive directors are bankers.
Indeed, whenever there is a vacancy on its board, FNFC's knee-jerk reaction
seems to be to add another banker. George Cracknell, 59, deputy managing
director of Barclays' banking division, is the latest recruit.
He takes over from Roy Vine, a former vice chairman of Barclays Bank UK, who
had been a FNFC director for 11 years. Vine was the man who conducted the
post mortem on what went wrong with Barclays' lending in the previous
recession. Will Cracknell get the job this time?

Meanwhile, at least the great British public will not have to volunteer
names for the Military Medal - an honour awarded to 'other ranks' for
conspicuous bravery. Its demise is unlikely to be mourned even by those few
survivors of the 1914-18 war in Europe.
In his book Old Soldiers Never Die published in 1933, Frank Richards, a
British soldier who fought throughout the first world war, wrote about the
class divisions which existed even in battle:
'In the spring of 1916 another decoration was introduced, called the
Military Medal. There were no grants or allowances with the Military Medal,
which without a shadow of a doubt had been introduced to save awarding too
many Distinguished Conduct Medals. With the DCM went a money-grant of Pounds
20, and a man in receipt of a life pension who had won the DCM was entitled
to an extra sixpence a day on his pension. After the new decoration was
introduced, for every DCM awarded there were 50 MMs. The old regular
soldiers thought very little of the new decoration.'

There is one bit of good news for the government amid the continuing
economic gloom, the problems with the coal industry and the setbacks over
ratifying the Maastricht treaty. The prime minister's brainwave of turning
the honours system into a DIY venture seems to be a roaring success with the
punters.
Only four days after the announcement and over 1,000 requests for
application forms have been received. This has resulted in a 20 per cent
increase in the team vetting the applications.
But although throwing open the honours system to all-comers may seem a
brilliant political ploy by a prime minister with the common touch, it is
bound to lead to widespread disappointment since the number of honours
available is likely to remain the same despite the increased demand.

No translator would presumably dare tone down the attack on Maastricht made
by former Bundesbank board member Wilhelm Nolling in the text of his book
just out in Germany. But it looks as though Macmillan will bowdlerise the
title when it publishes the English version.
In German the combative tome is called Unser Geld (Our Money), and subtitled
'The struggle for currency stability in Europe'. In it Nolling lambasts
politicians for cobbling together a fundamentally flawed treaty, claiming
that the injection of a single currency will infect Europe with instability.
Best leave European monetary policy to the Bundesbank, he suggests, adding
that Germany should keep the D-Mark.
Nolling, a member of the Social Democrat party, made a name for himself as
one of the most fiery members of the Bundesbank's council. After fiercely
criticising Chancellor Kohl's policies on monetary unification with eastern
Germany and over the Maastricht treaty, he left at the end of last year to
pursue academic and publishing interests.
So why is Macmillan wet-blanketing Nolling's expose under the yawn-inducing
title 'Monetary policy in Europe after Maastricht'? 'We don't talk about
money in quite the same way here,' sniffs editor Belinda Holdsworth. Her
rivals at Heinemann have no such qualms. When the FT's David Marsh penned
his Bundesbank tome, he had to tone down Heinemann's suggested title - from
'The Bank that rules the world', to 'The Bank that rules Europe'.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Building coal mountains
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CURRENT 'solution' to the pit crisis being discussed in British
government circles would involve paying miners to produce coal nobody wants
and then stockpiling it. The only merit in this suggestion - with its echoes
of European Community wine lakes and butter mountains - is that it might
bring home the absurdity of further rigging the energy sector.
When the government announced 31 pit closures last October, there was an
outcry led by a number of backbench Tory MPs. Many were attached to the idea
that, if only British Coal was given more time to cut costs, the threatened
pits could have a viable long-term future. But, as the months have passed,
it has become clear that few, if any, can be made viable without imposing
huge costs on the economy.
There may be a case for producing an extra 40m or so tonnes of coal over
five years, which could save about six pits - though strike threats
undermine the case by making coal supplies seem more insecure. If the price
of coal were reduced to world market levels by subsidies, at a cost of
perhaps Pounds 300m over the period, the electricity generators would buy
the extra coal instead of imported coal. The hope is that productivity could
then be improved and a subsidy would not be needed.
The snag with keeping open any more of the threatened pits is that the coal
has no guaranteed market. Hence the stockpiling idea, which could save
another five pits, the minimum number the government thinks necessary to win
over backbench dissidents.
But the marginal cost of saving an extra five pits would be huge. Not only
would the coal have to be subsidised, but the generators might have to be
paid to keep their capital tied up in coal mountains. On top of these
visible costs, there would be invisible ones. The power duopoly is
understood to want immunity from reference to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission as a quid pro quo. Furthermore, building coal mountains would
complicate privatisation of British Coal and so postpone the best chance to
improve its productivity. Who would want to buy coal buried underground when
so much was already on the surface?
Such drawbacks may lead the government to re-examine other options for
expanding British Coal's market. These include restricting output from
gas-fired power stations, postponing competition in the electricity market,
closing nuclear stations and stopping imports of French electricity. But the
cost of such rigging would be written-off investments and higher electricity
bills. Moreover, it would not even secure the long-term viability of the
industry unless the distortions were to continue indefinitely.
The least bad way forward would be for the government to acknowledge that no
more coal should be produced than the market is willing to buy. If it feels
the need to sweeten such a pill for political purposes, it could improve the
already generous redundancy terms or put more money into job creation in
mining communities. So far more than 7,000 miners have volunteered to leave
on the current terms which provide average lump sums of Pounds 28,000. Even
if the terms were improved substantially, this would still be cheaper than
stockpiling coal nobody wants.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HAS RECESSION taken the pressure off central London's creaking public
transport system? Try asking commuters on the Central Line, London
Underground's main east-west link across the capital. Even at today's
reduced passenger levels, peak-hour loadings are 45 per cent above the
levels for which the line was designed. Yet the Treasury is now questioning
the need for the planned Pounds 2bn CrossRail scheme, a new east-west rail
line due to open around the turn of the century.
CrossRail would bring big benefits to central London. By providing a link
between British Rail's Liverpool Street and Paddington stations, it would
enable suburban trains to run straight through central London stopping at
stations in the West End and the City on the way. Many commuters could then
reach their destinations without changing to the Underground, so saving time
and reducing pressure on the Central Line.
Questioning such a project looks perverse at a time when London Underground
is poised to embark on a Pounds 1.8bn extension of the Jubilee Line to the
Docklands development area. Like CrossRail, the Jubilee Line extension was
approved before recession set in. At the time, cost/benefit analyses of the
two projects yielded similar results. Since then, the outlook for employment
growth in Docklands (and hence, demand for transport) has deteriorated much
more than it has in central London. Yet it is the financially stronger case
for CrossRail that has now come under Treasury scrutiny.
There is an argument for pressing ahead with the Jubilee Line extension for
the regenerative effect it would have on Docklands, but certainly not if it
is at the expense of providing central London with an acceptable transport
system. While money is being ploughed into transport for Docklands - Pounds
1.8bn for the Jubilee Line, Pounds 1.65bn for roads and Pounds 800m for an
expansion of the Docklands Light Railway - central London has seen the
Pounds 750m-a-year capital spending budget for its transport system cut by a
third, and CrossRail is now the only significant transport project on the
horizon.
Docklands is not the only part of London that needs good transport: central
London needs it, too. If the government cannot see this, it can only be
because it regards one of the capital's withered extremities as more
important than its overall economic health.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Footloose across Europe's frontiers: Recession and the
single market are prompting industry to reorganise and relocate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US maker of vacuum cleaners moves production from Dijon to Glasgow. A
Swiss chocolate maker does the reverse. A US computer giant shuts a plant in
Galway. Another builds one in Barcelona. The industrial map of Europe is
being redrawn, some say for the next 30 years. Political passions run high
and nations abuse each other. But who is actually winning?
There are different pressures at work. The most obvious is the European
recession, the worst for a decade. Others have nothing to do with the
economic cycle. The single market is forcing companies to rationalise
production. The opening of eastern Europe offers cheap labour and makes
Germany more central than before. The continuing shift in working methods
sets a premium on skilled and flexible workers.
Mr David Rees, a location specialist with Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy
firm, says: 'Ten years ago, the key factor for a manufacturing plant was the
size of the national market. Now it's a question of the European market, or
at least the northern or southern European market. Previously, companies
might make products in three countries to cater for national standards and
tastes. Now, the point is that economies of scale can actually be achieved.'
Service functions are being rationalised as well. 'Companies are
increasingly looking to putting things like customer care in one centre for
Europe. One US white goods manufacturer is doing that right now. Another US
company has its accounting function in seven countries and is putting it
into one,' says Mr Rees.
And manufacturing techniques are changing. Mr Jonathan Wilmot, an economist
with Credit Suisse First Boston, says: 'The reason the issue gets so emotive
is that, if you look at new technologies such as lean production, the whole
spirit is based on continuous innovation, in which managers use the
workforce as part of the process on the Japanese model. If people are
prepared to do whatever job comes, that makes a huge difference on the
location decision.'
These various pressures can work in opposing directions. The point can be
simply illustrated in the case of the UK. Hoover's decision to close its
Dijon plant and put all its production of vacuum cleaners in Scotland caused
uproar in France last month. And the Hoover case is far from unique.
Bowater, the UK-based packaging group, recently shifted production of some
of its cosmetic packaging to the UK from France and Italy. The company has
calculated national ratios for average employment costs at its plants, from
managing director down to apprentice. If the UK is 100, says Mr Michael
Hartnall, Bowater's finance director, Italy is 130, France 140 and Germany
170.
IMI, the Birmingham-based engineering company, last year switched production
of drinks dispensing machines from Germany to the UK. Mr Gary Allen,
managing director, says: 'Even before sterling devalued, the UK was a very
good place to invest relative to continental Europe. It has a very
co-operative and flexible workforce. While we have to consult, we can make
changes based on management decisions much faster than elsewhere. The social
costs are significantly lower in the UK as well.'
But there are pressures the other way. Mr Rees says: 'Our strengths are the
English language, very good telecommunications and air communications. But
the problem is the UK's image as a poor European. I can think of six or
eight companies now headquartered in the UK which are moving out, and that's
one of the reasons. I think it's doing us a serious amount of harm.'
This might seem at odds with the fact that the UK has taken the lion's share
of inward investment into Europe in recent years, whether from Japanese
carmakers or US computer companies. But that, says Mr Rees, might now prove
a handicap.
'In the case of Japan, there is a sense of gentle political pressure from
Miti (the Ministry of International Trade and Industry) on Japanese
companies not to favour Britain as much as in the past. In terms of
Japanese-EC relations, that also follows from the image of the UK as a poor
European. And while the UK has the advantage of language for a first
location, there is often a tendency to be a bit bolder the next time.'
Similar conflicting pressures can be seen in the case of Germany. Mr David
Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca, the drugs and agrochemicals company about
to be floated off from ICI, lists some drawbacks.
'If you're looking at building a new plant, the time taken for planning
approval matters a lot. The Germans have got terribly bureaucratic, and that
could start to work against them. You want a system which gives you a yes or
no fairly fast. And I wouldn't put any product into German manufacture now
involving any kind of genetic engineering. Hoechst has had an insulin plant
ready for five years, and hasn't been allowed to operate it because of
delays and appeals from the green movement.'
Some German companies, at least, see it slightly differently. Mr Volker
Jung, a director of electronics group Siemens, says: 'Even though it will be
more and more difficult to manufacture in Germany, I have to admit it has
many advantages. The labour force is experienced, Germany is central to
Europe, and there are many products where automation is so far advanced that
labour is not an important issue any more.'
One country that is emerging as a winner is France, partly because of
increased efforts by the French authorities to attract inward investment. Mr
Rees of Ernst &amp; Young says: 'I believe France ought to be doing best, even
if the noise they're making over Hoover may not help. France is dearer than
Spain, but it's towards the lower end of the range. And it's a big country,
with lots of good sites.'
This seems borne out by the statistics. The Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development has just published figures for inward
investment in the first half of 1992. While investment in the UK fell almost
30 per cent from the year before and in Germany rose by just 7 per cent, in
France it rose 31 per cent. For the first time, says the OECD, foreign
direct investment in France is bigger than French investment abroad.
But in one sense, generalising about countries is to miss the point. For
many industries, the choice on location is not to do with nations but with
regions within them. Mr Wilfried Vossen of Plant Location International, a
Brussels-based consultant, says: 'There is more difference between French
regions like the Ile de France and Lorraine, or between Dutch regions like
North Holland and Amsterdam, than there is between Amsterdam and the Ile de
France.'
The point is borne out by Mr Hartnall of Bowater. When the company switched
production to the UK, he says, 'we did it from the north of Italy and the
Paris area to Portsmouth, which is cheap. If it had been the south of Italy
instead of the north, or the M4 corridor instead of Portsmouth, it might
have been different.'
And as Mr Jung of Siemens remarks, a lot of purchasing decisions are
political. 'Don't forget that all politics are local politics. Politicians
will always find a way not to buy non-local products. For a guy seeking
election in northern Spain, Hamburg is outside, whatever the EC says.'
But if there are factors working against rationalisation within Europe,
there are wider issues which go beyond Europe altogether. 'Bear in mind,'
says Mr Allen of IMI, 'that we're up against Japanese competition. The
overlay to all this is whether we should be making things in the Far East or
the US.'
Mr Jung puts the point more strongly. 'The real question for me is where
production will be 10 years from now in world terms. The answer is east
Asia, especially greater China - Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. There
you have the market plus low labour costs. Growth there will be much greater
than in Europe, in terms not just of production but of product development.'
But there will be enough upheaval in Europe to be getting on with. As Mr
Wilmot of Credit Suisse First Boston puts it: 'The single market story is
overlapping with the changing work methods story. The point is that no one
knows what the end result will look like. That's political dynamite.'

FT  09 MAR 93 / Personal View: The case for conservative economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY HOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Norman Lamont will take his ritual stroll next Tuesday through St James's
Park and hold his battered Gladstone box aloft on the steps of Number 11.
Then, after telling the House of Commons that 'the increases in duty I have
just announced will take effect from 6pm today', the chancellor will have
enacted a uniquely British ritual for the very last time.
For there will never again be a spring Budget. The political theatre of this
year's Budget day - to be displaced by a combined Budget and Autumn
Statement next November - offers a perfect opportunity for the British
government to re-establish its credibility and authority in the financial
sphere, by responding to a nation and to markets positively yearning for a
clear sense of direction.
The last six months have been deeply unhappy ones for the cause of
conservative economics in Britain. The country's ignominious retreat from
the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16 marked yet another
failure to establish a long-term framework of economic discipline, and laid
Britain open to acute dangers of short-term pragmatism and wishful thinking
so reminiscent of the pre-Thatcher past.
Since then, substantial monetary loosening caused by an unplanned
devaluation of 20 per cent has been accompanied both by rapid interest rate
cuts and by the ballooning of the budget deficit. The one-off opportunity to
curb expenditure in the wake of an election victory has almost gone.
Optimistic claims about British public-sector finances being hyper-cyclical
have been thought to justify the emergence of a Reaganomics-style budget
deficit - which the UK's exposed and trade-dependent economy is far less
able to sustain than even the US.
People forget that Black Wednesday was not a liberation, but a warning of
recurrent weaknesses and of the hazards which still face countries unable to
establish monetary discipline as the basis of non-inflationary growth. Black
Wednesday proved that our original Thatcher agenda of sound money, fiscal
rectitude and supply-side reform had not bitten deep enough to consolidate
the reversal of Britain's long-term decline. The tragedy is that this had
not been secured by earlier entry into the ERM. Black Wednesday was a signal
not for 'rejoicing' but for renewing our attack on the underlying problems -
still rising real earnings, public spending, persistent regulatory obstacles
to growth - in a way that will produce enduring improvement.
Consider the figures. The four 'wise men' (of the chancellor's chosen seven)
who commit themselves to medium-term projections predicate growth at an
average of 2.5 per cent over the next four years. Only in the third year do
they see the jobless total falling below 3m (no surprise there; but it is a
warning against false prophets). They see inflation breaking through the
government's 1 to 4 per cent ceiling in 1995, then rising higher still. They
expect the PSBR to remain as high as 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product
in 1996-97, even after assuming tax increases of Pounds 4bn to Pounds 8bn
over the next two years.
By 1995, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, government debt will have returned to its 1979 level of 45 per
cent of GDP, compared with only 29 per cent in 1990. Inescapably, we should
find ourselves in the immediate run-up to the next election entering another
stop-go cycle, with the government forced to slam on the brakes to contain
both inflation and borrowing as a matter of urgency.
Since we at least have renewed success against inflation, we must
consolidate that gain. Only sustained low inflation will offer a credible
basis for growth, and only continuous attention to sound public finances,
backed by a formal monetary framework, will allow that low inflation to be
made permanent.
In response to these imperatives, the chancellor does need to raise taxes in
the forthcoming Budget. First, because we have to start curbing the fiscal
deficit now. Second, because market confidence is so low that only action
can give credibility to any commitment to put public finances on a firmer
footing. Third, because the prime minister could actually be right in
claiming that Britain may lead the Community growth league in the year
ahead. Even that expectation could be put at risk if the government was to
delay the fiscal action that is already needed to avoid a fatal U-turn three
years from now.
There is no insuperable difficulty in finding ways to reduce the gap. Start
with the radical curbs on public spending or tax subsidies that have so far
seemed too difficult: phasing-out of mortgage interest relief or of the
lower retirement age for women, for example; or making a reality of the
promise to mobilise private finance for infrastructure projects. Then, look
for ways of reforming the tax system so as to generate substantial new
revenues: broadening the VAT base - at a lower rate; higher green taxes;
employees' national insurance contributions - a higher rate or higher up the
income scale or both.
Spread sensibly, such actions can be rendered acceptable and presented
positively. They could, and should, be coupled with measures directed mainly
at the labour market, and designed to make as quick and as credible an
impact on the dole queue as possible; one can suggest revived, refurbished
or extended versions of the Community Programme, the Enterprise Allowance or
the Business Expansion Scheme.
President Clinton has courageously blazed the trail of deficit reduction, to
unexpected popular acclaim. A similarly hard-headed attempt by the British
government to explain and address the real problems of our economy is more
likely to reap political reward than playing to the gallery and hoping for
the best. Displaying the courage of one's convictions worked before. It can
work again.
The Maastricht miasma which Euro-phobes have imposed upon the Conservative
party is sapping the will to face problems, to provide the leadership so
urgently necessary. The greatest service the chancellor can perform for his
country is to do what is right, not what is popular.
So far from 'snuffing out' the incipient recovery, a Budget-based programme
of the kind that I have suggested should complement the substantial monetary
easing that has already occurred. Just as my 1981 Budget was able to do, it
would offer the best prospect of sustained recovery over the longer term.
The coming Budget should be used to restore the centrality of conservative
economics to the economic policy of the Conservative government. For so long
as we are absent from the ERM, we have to summon up our own determined
commitment to virtue.
Lord Howe of Aberavon was chancellor from 1979-83 and foreign secretary from
1983-89

FT  09 MAR 93 / Imagine no Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Make-believe time is here again. Just imagine. In spite of last night's
defeat in the Commons, everything is about to come right for the British
government. A grateful nation will shortly be singing the praises of Mr John
Major, his cabinet, even his chancellor. It is a charming fancy. If you get
drunk, stand on your head, shut your eyes and picture the fairies at the
bottom of the garden you might wake up believing it.
The case for such a touching exercise of faith is deceptively strong. The
political scenery is shifting. Winter is nearly over. Doom and gloom, those
unwelcome guests whom the prime minister seeks to evict, always arrive with
the cold and the dark. They usually leave when the days get longer and
warmer. The recession is coming to an end; spirits will rise as the
inevitable upswing begins. Sales of new houses and cars seem to be picking
up. As we are frequently reminded by Number 10 Downing Street, interest
rates are at their lowest since the prime minister was a lad. The annual
rate of inflation is under 2 per cent.
There is more. Wage-cost pressures are becoming insignificant. The CBI says
that pay settlements have fallen to their lowest level for 13 years. The
Institute of Directors says that half the chairmen and chief executives who
answered its latest questionnaire confess to a feeling of optimism. The
equivalent figure in the depths of winter was 38 per cent. On the stock
exchange the Footsie index o'erleaps itself every other day, while brokers
confidently predict a bull market in government bonds. The explanation may
be foreign buyers, or leads given by Tokyo or the Dow, but the effect is the
same. That wonderful resurgent feeling is entering the nation's bloodstream,
and it isn't only spring fever.
If past performance is any guide, the initial reaction to the forthcoming
Budget will be that the government is onto a winner. When Mr Norman Lamont
sits down next Tuesday afternoon he may even be cheered by the benches
behind him. This happens with most chancellors, in most years. Second
thoughts come later. Mr Lamont is clearly aware of this. He is soliciting
post-Budget social engagements all over town. He must feel that he has
something to sell. Himself? That is the cynic's answer.
A less narrow interpretation is that he is under orders to restore
confidence. This sounds right. It will, after all, be Mr Major's Budget. The
official advice that goes to Mr Lamont also goes to the prime minister, who
was the man in charge when Sir Terry Burns was made head of the Treasury.
The present chancellor is allowed to make small decisions on his own. The
fiscal stance, the thrust of the Budget, is the prime minister's to
determine. The pair of them know that the holders of their two offices sink
or swim together. Mr Nigel Lawson jumped overboard, and soon afterwards Mrs
Margaret Thatcher also went under. No Conservative minister has forgotten
the lesson of those events. Mr Major is determined to be more of a hands-on
manager of the economy than his predecessor; Mr Lamont is not in a position
to demur.
It is at this point in the optimist's daydream that the bill to ratify the
Maastricht treaty comes in to burst the bubble. It need not be so. We may
brush aside the treaty's regular escapes from extinction in parliament.
These have become a bore for all save the few dozen fanatics who glory
beneath the banner of Euro-sceptic. Even the government's dramatic
humiliation of last night may eventually be forgotten. Assume, as most
ministers do, that one day the bill is passed. Over and done with. Behind
us. Combine that happy anticipation with the expected glad tidings on the
economy and you are ready to accept that quite soon we will witness the
rehabilitation of a government whose authority was drained away on Black
Wednesday.
Reality is an awkward devil. It will insist on breaking into such fanciful
meanderings. Reality tells us that the divisions in the Conservative party
have become so bitter, so deep, that they will not heal, at least not
quickly, even when the recovery is well under way and the Maastricht treaty
has been ratified. For Mr Major is not merely saddled with a small majority.
He aspires to run a traditional British-style elective dictatorship on the
strength of a coalition of Conservatives and Sometimes-Conservatives. This
would not be remarkable in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium or other
continental democracies in which coalition-building is the norm. In Britain
it is so extraordinary that nobody realises what is happening.
The strength of the Sometimes-Conservatives has to be gauged whenever an
important proposal is put before the Commons. Their presence is such a
threat to the government that other possible allies, such as the Ulster
Unionists or even, in extremis, the Liberal Democrats, are kept sweet. This
affects everything. Question: how much pressure should be put on the
Unionists in Belfast in response to the Dublin government's recent peace
overtures? Answer: it depends on what the government may need to ask of the
Unionists in the Commons. Should the pension age be equalised for men and
women? Not if it seems to have been demanded by the Europeans (although if
Mr Peter Lilley, a known Euro-sceptic, is to make the announcement, perhaps
the Sometimes-Conservatives will accept it). How many coal mines will be
closed? Answer: how many S-Cs will vote for whatever number is proffered?
There is another reason why the restoration of the government's fortunes is
likely to be a long and painful process. People are aware that the end of
the recession has been brought forward by the forced abandonment of a
managed exchange rate - something that, a week before it happened, the prime
minister and the chancellor told us would be the height of irresponsibility.
To claim credit for the beneficial results of that failure is pretty cheeky.
While unemployment remains so high, and the fear of it reaches into nearly
every home, such a claim will sound hollow.
Voters can see that we have a weak government, led by a prime minister who
is unable to unite his party, even by appealing to old loyalties. That was
true in the darkest days of winter, and it may be just as true in bright
midsummer. Never mind. Government matters less than you think. Most of us,
most of the time, can manage very well without it.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CATHERINE GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, 'One-stop shops' make good sense and could provide a welcome
simplification of the current plethora of government initiatives, if as
David Grayson writes (Personal View, March 1), 'the opportunity of the
century' is not wasted. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) do not need
another signposting office giving directions to other government
departments. They need one centre that can provide solid, reliable and
practical advice about a range of business, financial and technological
issues, as well as access to expertise both within government and the
private sector. Modelling one-stop shops on the existing, effective citizens
advice bureau network would provide a means of achieving this.
Given that some banks also find this 'corporate advice bureau' idea
attractive, the one-stop shops might then achieve even stronger long-term
relationships between banks and SMEs.

<TEXT>
Your economics correspondent is incorrect (''Wise man' attacks wisdom of
fellow economists', March 6) in his judgment that 'the authority of the
government's new panel of economic advisers . . . has been thrown into doubt
. . . by Professor Tim Congdon'.
It was thrown into doubt in the first place by the appointment of two
ultra-monetarists to the panel. The Treasury cannot be pleased now that Mr
Congdon, displaying a political touch equal to his grasp of economics, has
given the game away.

Sir, I can't see how Brian McNamara (Letters, March 2) can possibly object
to the FT calling Brian Mulroney an 'Irish charmer'. A stereotype it may be,
but the example of other Irish politicians from around the world - Ulster's
Ian Paisley, Australia's Paul Keating, the late Robert 'Piggy' Muldoon of
New Zealand - surely testify to its validity.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Letter: Treatment of contaminated land needs a planned
approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL J CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader (Polluted land, March 4) accurately summed up the current
debate on contaminated land but may have given a misleading impression of
the position of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The RICS has
not, as you suggest, argued that the seller of a property should be
responsible for demonstrating that the land under offer is free from
contamination. That approach has been tried in parts of the US and found
wanting.
Our proposal is for a planning-based approach to contamination. We want to
see a land quality statement, based on a site investigation, become an
integral part of a planning application. This would mean that any
contamination present on a site would be identified - and could then be
dealt with - whenever significant development or a change of use took place.
We accept the point you make that this is not the entire solution to the
problem of contamination. But there is no one solution. A range of measures
is needed. There is already a mass of legislation on the statute book to
combat contamination that poses a threat to public health. That needs to be
used more often. There is also a need for greater assistance from government
to help with the very high costs of treating the worst cases of pollution.
We have sympathy with your suggestion of pressing councils to identify land
that is badly contaminated. The problem is that such an approach can only
work if local authorities have the resources to carry out any site
investigations that may be necessary and there is a mechanism in place for
rehabilitating sites where serious contamination is found.
One thing is clear whatever the government announces. The whole of the
property world, as well as business, lenders, insurers and others, now
accepts that contamination of land is an issue which is not going to go
away.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Letter: Control culture can avert risks of derivatives
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN TATTERSALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir David Walker's contribution to the debate on the regulation of
derivatives ('Derivatives - a delicate balance', March 4) is most welcome.
While the control of derivatives trading operations is rightfully a
principal concern of the management of financial institutions and their
regulators and supervisors, the size of the off-balance sheet commitments
involved can easily lead to a distorted view of the real risks.
We would suggest one additional principle be added to Sir David's five
principles of a viable approach to regulation of derivatives trading:
namely, the development in financial institutions of a flexible and dynamic
control culture.
While the specification of capital requirements for such institutions is
important, it is only the exercise of effective control by management over
derivatives traders which will ensure that serious problems are avoided.
Such controls should include recruitment procedures which ensure that
dealers are of the highest integrity; proper incentives for dealers to
encourage them to achieve all of the corporate objectives, not just
short-term profitability; and regular training. There should also be other
forms of corporate communication to make sure that they know what those
corporate goals are; competent independent checks on their trading
strategies and valuations; and internal controls over the transactions.
These must be backed up by a high quality of on-site management in the
dealing room.
In our experience institutions which have successfully established an
effective control culture are far less exposed to many of the potential
problems in derivatives trading.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Letter: Industrial comparison selective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW MITCHELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In criticising the 'tub-thumping' of the manufacturing lobby, Tony
Thomson of Bankers Trust Investment Management (Letters, March 5) offers a
rather selective argument. To reassure us that things are not as bad as they
seem, he compares the UK's manufacturing performance to that of other
English-speaking countries, with France thrown in as the token 'other'.
Unfortunately, our anglophone friends share the UK's dismal record on
manufacturing investment and boom-bust economic growth, as well as (no
coincidence this) our rentier culture and an over-developed stock market.
His accusation that British manufac-turing industry was historically
'over-manned and under-managed', also comes rich from a representative of
the securities business.
Those in glass houses, Mr Thomson.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Letter: Tax relief plea for head offices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D J MURBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is quite proper for multinational companies to review their HQ
operations to determine:
whether the cost is really necessary and adds value;
whether the function should be delegated to an operating entity.
However, if at the conclusion of the review the function and expenditure are
retained at the centre, in what jurisdiction does the multinational company
obtain a tax deduction for the expense?
In his interesting article, ('The myth of the bloated head office', March 5)
Christopher Lorenz does not mention that most multinational companies have
difficulty in obtaining a tax deduction for centrally incurred costs which
benefit not only the parent company but also many of the operating
subsidiaries. Failure to obtain a tax deduction for the expense considerably
increases the net costs of an HQ function. A gross-up factor of only 33 per
cent, using the UK corporate tax rate which is lower than most, is not an
inconsiderable added cost]
It is high time that Revenue authorities recognised that a cost incurred on
revenue account ought to be deductible somewhere.

BBC2's generally excellent foreign affairs series Assignment (7.45) asks
whether colonialism is coming back into fashion, what with American marines
in Somalia and the World Bank dictating terms in so many places. BBC1 shows
the first episode of Luv by Carla Lane. They are still describing her work
as 'family comedy' though ever since 'Butterflies' it has been moving closer
to tragedy. It would be more honest to take off the laughter track and
present it for what it is. This series is about a self-made man, played by
Michael Angelis, who 'gives his wife and three adopted children everything
money can buy, but doesn't realise money can't buy them what they really
need' (8.00). ITV screens its pilot for a British version of 'The Golden
Girls', Brighton Belles, within its 'Comedy Playhouse' season. Sheila
Hancock, Sheila Gish and Wendy Craig play the younger trio and Jean Boht
takes the mother role played by Estelle Getty in the US original (8.30).
Channel 4's Without Walls examines the lives of early actresses who were
assumed to be prostitutes; and invites George Melly to have a go at the
later work of Henry Moore (9.00).

FT  09 MAR 93 / Arts: Back to the figurative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though one would hardly think it, to look at the artists promoted abroad by
the British Council, or supported by the Tate Gallery or our other major
domestic institutions, figurative painting continues to flourish to a
remarkable extent in this country. By that I mean painting founded in the
direct response to the visible world, to landscape, the figure and still
life, as in the Beaux Arts tradition.
Until a generation ago, it was the staple of all training in the fine arts,
for sculptors, too, were brought up in the observation and modelling of the
figure. But to speak of such things today is to speak a foreign language so
far as most artists under the age of 50 are concerned. If the tradition
still flourishes, it does so at the hands of artists of a certain age.
Sargy Mann is in his mid-fifties, a product of the Camberwell School under
the old, unreformed dispensation. He is a painter of landscape, but the
landscape neither of great distances nor of particular scenes, details or
effects. His subject is rather the near and middle ground: the studio
interior or, as in this exhibition, the comparatively close and oddly
enclosed spaces near his home at Bungay in Suffolk; the village street,
footbridge and river bank, farm buildings.
The wonder is that he is able to paint at all, for he is now nearly blind,
with no more than peripheral vision in one eye. This is not to make
allowance for the work, but to remark upon its nature. The over-coming of
the disability has had a profound and clear effect upon what the work
actually is, both in its process and its result.
Unable to consider the subject-scene in its entirety, he is forced to
examine it point by point and even to walk into it himself, to look more
closely, to pace and feel and measure. And the surface of the painting is
the record of this process, with its scribbled chalk notation of
registration and confirmation, its loose atmospheric suggestions and the
final, solid, monumental simplicity of the forms themselves: the buildings,
roofs and objects by which the true pictorial space is established.
The sense is of the painting never stopping, a continuous and living
process, with every day a new start, from which the sense of place,lively
and authentic, is teased at last. Mann's is indeed an aesthetic of process
and physical commitment, quite remarkably so.
Hans Schwarz is now 70, a refugee from Vienna and the Nazis before the War
who has made his life in England ever since. He too is a painter of
landscape, but no local loyalist, for he is as likely to be taken by the
visual excitement of a zebra crossing as by the view across the Thames to St
Paul's, or a French village street, or a Somerset duck-pond. He is also one
of the most forceful and lively painters in water-colour at work in this
country, which is not at all intended as the back-handed compliment it might
seem.
The conventional hierarchy of media, by which oil on canvas rates as
something inherently more serious and valuable than work on paper, was
always something of a nonsense. Serious artists use whatever medium and
material are appropriate to their particular and immediate needs, and the
portability of paper and the speed and flexibility of water-colour make
their own case.
Schwarz is no narrow specialist, but that his large water-colours should be
so cheap is merely to make the point with a nice irony. He uses body colour
to some extent, which sacrifices something of the natural luminosity of true
water-colour, but he gains infinitely in the richness of his effects, both
physically on the surface, and in his colour, for he is an instinctive and
adventurous colourist, with his dense oranges and purples, greens and
ochres.
He shares this current show with the much looser, more abstracted landscape
water-colours of Jenny Ryrie, a young painter from Scotland having her first
proper showing in London.
Ben Levene, again, is in his mid-fifties, a product of the Slade School
under Coldstream, but no dot-and-carry methodist. He paints still-life,
flowers in pots for the most part, and the landscape as though seen through
the window, the view high across the fields to dark hills beyond. The
drawing is close enough to be positively descriptive, as opposed to the
merely suggestive, but a closer view shows it also to be quite crude in its
sophisticated way, graphically firm and purposeful rather than more subtly
accommodating.
The effect is oddly emblematic, most especially in the flower pieces, a
quality often reinforced by the use of a gold-leaf ground, setting the image
up in an almost hieratic isolation. Presented so simply and directly, the
paintings seem so much the more charged with colour, and it is indeed as a
colourist that Levene is most interesting. He is no strident colourist, but
within the cool range of his greens and reds, golds and blacks, he does
achieve a remarkable control, the brightest viridian that is a field a mile
or two away sitting quite properly in its pictorial place, keeping its
distance. And with Matisse and Manet, Levene knows, what most artists do
not, how rich and various a colour black can be.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Arts: Macbeth - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Johnson disliked Macbeth because of the line 'Nor heav'n peep through the
blanket of the dark, to cry, Hold, Hold]' Who, thought Johnson, could hear
of peeping through a blanket? Now videos, lasers and scarifying electric
soundtrack challenge the settled gravity of Macbeth in a bold, fresh,
wayward production at the Leicester Haymarket.
Julia Bardsley's heavily-cut text reduces Shakespeare's shortest play to a
shade over two hours: out go the Porter, the evocations of Dunsinane and the
lyrical lines on sleep; in come lasers, microphones and stroboscopic light.
The nine actors rove around three sunken water tanks, two dozen chairs and a
rail of coats.
Bardsley's newness of insight certainly reshapes the play. The initial
encounter between Macbeth and Duncan is played twice: first as 'There's no
art to find the mind's construction in the body', and then as the usual
'face', a joke about body language in the video age. Soliloquies are shouted
into microphones, muttered through cigarettes, or shared between characters.
These cuts and alterations stress the action, a play-size model of Macbeth's
'If 'twere done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly.'
Of course, Shakespeare often needs alteration. The scenes in England -
largely cut here - do little more than give the actor playing Macbeth an
act's rest. But this production distorts both the play and the mind's own
workout in the theatre. Scourging Macbeth of its lyricism turns the action
into physical event rather than verbal interplay. The witches' warnings to
Macbeth are drowned in a welter of electric distortion, so first-time
playgoers would have no idea what was happening. These prophecies must be
clear so Macbeth's fear becomes understandable in the final scene. Other
directorial waywardness includes having Lady Macbeth sleepwalk along a long
line of pillows, like someone trudging through a snowdrift, rubbing her
hands with cold; and having all the characters prowl over the set,
colonising the stage space but dissipating the focused energies of the
verse.
Christopher Toulmin's lighting is the technical hero. The deep black stage
is scoured by floodlights, rotating, searching out the shadows among heaps
of ladder-back chairs: red light for murders, blue for night. Purple and
green lasers represent the witches, who speak in three voices through one
actor with a video camera. The anti-climactic chaos of the final scene finds
Macbeth surrounded by chairs, raincoats and spotlights. The moral issues are
dismissed as Macbeth's identity is excised. It was the radical Dr Johnson
who thought the action of Macbeth too forthright to admit of individual
characters.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Arts: More Britten at the Barbican - Weekend music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It cannot be often that the audience at a music festival can be drawn to a
programme of films about miners and postmen. The Barbican's recent study
weekends devoted to the works of single composers have ferreted out some
interesting fringe items for the cinema and the present Festival of Britten
is no exception.
On Sunday three short documentaries with scores by Britten were shown in
Cinema 3. They are early works, mere bread-and-butter earnings perhaps, but
bold, inventive, adventurous. Coal Face - an educational film dating from
the 1930s about the coal industry's pivotal place in the British economy
(how times change]) - is astonishingly modern in its aim of creating music
out of the sounds of industrial tools and equipment, even coal tumbling down
a chute.
Encountering out-of-the-way pieces like these widens one's appreciation of
how far ahead of his time the young Britten was. There is a theory recently
given air-time on Channel 4 that, in later life, Britten became too much
part of the establishment and in some way less true to himself. With so much
of his music on offer, it should be possible to come to some overall view of
his output before this month-long festival reaches its close.
Certainly the music of the 1930s hits hard in a way that makes some of
Britten's later work sound unduly comfortable by comparison. The main
evening concert at the Barbican Hall on Sunday included the Violin Concerto
of 1940. This has always seemed to me the strongest of all his orchestral
works, a score with a troubling blend of disquiet and foreboding that gives
it an atmosphere all of its own. Mark Lubotsky, violinist on the composer's
own recording, was the pithy, occasionally uncertain, visiting soloist.
There really is little comparison in the quality of this music and the
sentimental pseudo-Elizabethan pastiche that makes up the Suite from
Gloriana of 1953, which opened the concert. As for the Young Person's Guide
to the Orchestra, that can claim professionalism in its defence, though it
does sound better when played less heavily than it was here by Mstislav
Rostropovich, conductor and architect of the festival.
No complaints about the concert as a whole, however. For at its centre was a
moving account of the Serenade for tenor, horn and strings, in which
Rostropovich's fondness for loving all the music he performs to excess did
pay dividends. Barry Tuckwell was the exemplary solo horn (we are lucky
still to have these associates of Britten with us) and Anthony Rolfe Johnson
sang the tenor part with such infinite sensitivity that the few moments of
strain will not be mentioned. For its part the London Symphony Orchestra
would seem to be enjoying another first-rate festival.
On Thursday Rostropovich had appeared as solo cellist, the role in which
Britten knew him. Perhaps his technique is no longer the dazzling,
note-perfect facility which inspired the daunting difficulties of the Solo
Cello Suites from the composer, but he still plays them (the Third, on this
occasion) with an intensity that is out of the reach of his successors. The
Cello Sonata, accompanied with light-fingered grace by Ian Brown, also
washed over with feeling.
Britten only met Rostropovich in 1960 and so the music that he wrote for him
dates from relatively late in his life. By and large they are works with a
renewed sense of purpose and individuality. As our knowledge of his music
grows, I am prepared to lay claim that it is Britten's middle years which
will eventually be seen as his weaker period.
Festival of Britten continues at the Barbican until March 21 (Box Office

FT  09 MAR 93 / Arts: Kissin in concert - Weekend music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Philharmonia's concert on Thursday, conducted by Leonard Slatkin, had
something for almost everyone - a nearly new work by James Macmillan, his
Sinfonietta, as well as a neglected Shostakovich symphony (the Sixth) and a
rare appearance in London of one of the most exciting pianists of the
younger generation, Yevgeny Kissin (reviewed in recital above by David
Murray).
Kissin is still only 21; Russian born, he made his British debut in 1987 at
the Lichfield Festival. His reputation here rests largely upon a handful of
recordings (including the First Tchaikovsky Concerto with Karajan, some
Brahms, Liszt and Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy) which readily distinguished
him from current excellent keyboard technicians as a pianist who evidently
regards his extraordinary dexterity as a means to a carefully considered end
rather than as an accomplishment in itself.
Certainly his reticent platform manner and uncomplicated keyboard style
implies thoughtfulness, and positively belies the glittering panache of
Kissin's playing; the clean-cut accuracy of his figuration and the perfectly
weighted rhythmic emphases seem utterly natural. Prokofiev's Third Concerto,
which he played with the Philharmonia, does not provide too many
opportunities for profound contemplation, yet there was a sense that
everything Kissin did was informed with a genuine musical purpose, that he
listened acutely to what was going on in the orchestra and gave every
passage a beginning, a middle and finally a structural function. By the
highest standard the performance was fractionally short on excitement. There
were no risks of any kind; never a hint of insecurity but no flashes of
inspirational daring either.
The support provided by the Philharmonia was always vigilant. Slatkin is a
refreshingly straightforward musician, a selfless accompanist, an unfailing
guide through the excitements and longueurs of a work like Shostakovich's
Sixth, and a reliable presenter of unfamiliar scores. In fact Macmillan's
Sinfonietta was not all that unfamiliar; it was first performed barely a
year ago by the London Sinfonietta who commissioned it.
At that premiere the single-movement work seemed thin on substance and
almost complacent in its formal planning, and the expansion to full
symphonic proportions (to which the programme note provided no clue
whatsoever) is no help at all in disguising the flabby musculature and
insipid melodic content.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Arts: Virtuosos at the piano - Weekend music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Saturday in the Wigmore Hall, the Swiss pianist Andreas Haefliger - late
20s, son of the distinguished Bach tenor Ernst - made his first London
appearance, and on Sunday at the Barbican the 21-year-old Russian Yevgeny
Kissin (already heard here in a concerto or two, one of which is reviewed by
Andrew Clements, below) gave his first solo recital at the Barbican. Even in
London, it is rare to come upon a pair of such remarkable debuts inside 24
hours.
On the strength of these performances Haefliger might be thought to have the
edge in continual, passionate expression, Kissin to excel in miraculous
pianism - not just aggressive bravura feats, but a speaking subtlety in
piano and pianissimo that held his Barbican audience in bated-breath
silence. Nonetheless, any such comparison would be pointless.
Haefliger's extra few years may explain why he could illuminate Schumann's
Davidsbundlertanze with so much direct feeling. This set of linked pieces -
later than Carnaval, despite their arsy-versy opus numbers - trades off the
composer's 'Florestan' persona (florid and pressing) against his soulful
'Eusebius' (tremulous and introspective) more specifically than any of his
other music. Most pianists treat it as semi-private, rarefied stuff to be
rendered in half-tones. In Haefliger's hands it brimmed with vitally
contrasted sentiments, naked and assured, and it made a grand, riveting
sequence.
The comparable high-water mark in Kissin's recital came with the three slow
Intermezzi of Brahms's op. 116 Fantasies. The quicker Capriccios were
superbly fastidious and fluid - that combination is Kissin's special
strength - but just on that account less craggy, troubled and unassuageable
than some old masters can make us hear. The Intermezzi, however, were
sculpted with nerve-end delicacy; they hung in the air like densely luminous
objects, each with its own poignant freighting. The house was spellbound;
this was piano-playing of a very rare order.
Haefliger had started off with Sofia Gubaidulina's Chacona, already 30 years
old but still bristling with muscular, visionary flashes. Kissin began with
four Liszt transcriptions of Schubert songs, where he emphasised the tunes
over the charms of Liszt's filigree enrichments. Instead of being cajoled by
those latter, which must be the best excuse for playing the Liszt versions,
we were reminded of how much more penetrating a singer can be with the vocal
lines. After them came the 'Wanderer' Fantasy, in which Kissin's lofty,
unblinking long-view compensated perfectly for his penchant for languishing
moments.
Both artists saved their pyrotechnical gifts for their second halves. After
unfolding deep, sumptuous textures for Debussy's second book of Images,
Haefliger whirled through Liszt's 'Mephisto Waltz' with far more digital
brilliance and sweep than he had allowed himself earlier in Mozart Kissin
went from his radiant Brahms back to Liszt, with a Rapsodie Espagnole of
bewitching elegance, wit and dazzling dispatch. Barring fatal accidents,
these pianists should command delighted audiences for many years to come.
On Sunday afternoon, while young Kissin was giving a recital at the
Barbican, a senior Russian pianist of considerable fame was doing the same
at the Royal Festival Hall (a regrettable clash for those in either audience
who might have wished to attend both). Lazar Berman has been absent from the
London scene since 1984; he returned with a familiar Berman programme -
Liszt and Liszt-Schubert in the first half, Mussorgsky's Pictures ay an
Exhibition in the second - and a keyboard style not at all changed by the
passing years.
Berman remains a 'piano animal' of astonishing ability. In the climaxes of
Liszt's Funerailles and Mussorgsky's Great Gate of Kiev finale he drew from
the instrument a sustained lion's roar that had nothing in it of banging or
applied force. In the Liszt Tarantella he achieved remarkable feats of
dexterity and filigree fleetness. The darker-toned Pictures were
characterised with many a piercingly idiomatic inflection derived from a
precisely weighted and varied keyboard touch.
What was lacking was any deep command of musical form and progress - rhythms
of slower passages tended to droop, phrasing to be vague - and any specific
involvement in re-creating moods of charm, tenderness, delicacy. The three
Liszt transcriptions of Schubert songs and the Petrarch Sonnet no. 104 were
delivered, not sung. For me (though not for the throngs of noisily
enthusiastic admirers) a Berman recital remains an odd compound of
moment-by-moment thrill and overall disappointment.

Justin Dukes (right), 51, a former managing director of Channel Four
Television, has been appointed a non-executive director of VTR, which
provides video post-production facilities for advertisers and programme
makers.
Dukes' name has been linked with a number of high-profile media jobs since
he quit Channel Four, including, most recently, a bid to get Britain's fifth
television channel based in Scotland.
A former joint managing director of the Financial Times, he joined Channel
Four in 1981 and was involved in its start-up. However, he lost out to
Michael Grade in the battle to succeed Jeremy Isaacs for the top job there
and in June 1988 left to become chief executive of Galileo, the
newly-created European airline computer reservation systems group. Since
1989 he has been chairman of the European Communications Industries
Consortium.

The Volkswagen/Audi import franchise in the UK has appointed a new titular
head little more than a month since the ink dried on its formal transfer
from Lonrho to the German motor group itself.
However, the appointment as chairman of Detlef Wittig (above), head of
export sales at the Wolfsburg parent, will have little impact on the
day-to-day running of the operation based in Milton Keynes. Wittig will be
non-executive and remain in Wolfsburg. Previous VAG (UK) chairmen have
similarly been non-executive, and drawn from Lonrho.
Wittig himself is no stranger to the British operation, having been a
non-executive director since 1989 - when VW first began flagging its
intention to take back the franchise from Lonrho by beefing up its board
with Wolfsburg appointees.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: Inquiries that neglect the man in the
street - The debate over company investigations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubts about Department of Trade and Industry company investigations as a
method of regulation have resurfaced in the wake of the recent publication
of the long-awaited report into share dealings by the conglomerate Suter and
its chairman, Mr David Abell.
Debate has been further fuelled by the revelation in the House of Commons
last week that the investigation cost Pounds 501,000.
The 147-page report, which had taken four and a half years to put together,
found no evidence that Mr Abell had acted in concert with associates in
taking stakes in a number of companies in the mid-1980s. The DTI said no
further action would be taken.
Yet the report called into question some of Mr Abell's evidence as
'inconsistent' or seeking to 'mislead'. It questioned the timing of private
share purchases by Mr Abell in Suter's potential bid targets.
Investors might legitimately ask why it took four and a half years to lift
the cloud hanging over Suter, particularly in the light of the DTI's
decision not to take action. Suter's growth was held back by the
investigation. Other small conglomerates with which it was compared during
the early 1980s have moved ahead.
Concern about the company investigations system as a means of protecting
individual consumer and investor interests were first voiced at the end of
the 1980s following criticisms of the handling of the House of Fraser,
Barlow Clowes and Guinness investigations.
The House of Commons Trade and Industry Committee produced a report in May
1990, calling for changes to make the system quicker and more efficient. It
said that broader public interests than just the duties of directors and the
rights of shareholders should be reflected in company law and the way it was
applied.
The DTI had told the committee that the object of Companies Act
investigations was to find out in the first place what was going on. This
was done by calling for papers and interviewing witnesses. This evidence
then formed the basis for any action, which included criminal prosecutions,
winding-up of companies, disqualification of directors, sanctions by
employers or other regulators, and changes in the law.
The committee, however, felt the overriding aims of investigations should be
to protect investors (and other companies or individuals with whom the
company under investigation may do business), to promote efficient and
honest markets, and to maintain the integrity of the UK as a financial and
business centre.
It concluded, from looking in particular at the House of Fraser report, that
the interests of consumers, non-equity investors, creditors and employees
did not attract the attention they deserved.
The committee also recommended changes to speed up the whole process. It
accepted the DTI's argument that it would be impractical, given the present
level of available resources, to abandon the use of part-time external
inspectors in favour of a full-time internal inspectorate. Even a small team
of full-time inspectors would be periodically underemployed or
overstretched. But it said outside inspectors should be required to devote
at least 75 per cent of their professional time to an inquiry and major
inquiries should complete their reports within 12 months.
The DTI's response to the committee's report was lukewarm. Professor John
Farrar, a company law specialist, called it 'characteristically complacent'.
The department accepted it had some responsibility for protecting the
interests of consumers and individual investors but said there had to be
realism about what any regulatory system could achieve. It could not hope to
prevent all company failures or misconduct. The objective should be to set a
framework within which investors could make their own judgments about risk
and reward.
The DTI criticised the committee for concentrating on major inquiries and
paying scant attention to the bulk of its investigatory work - basic
fact-finding carried out by in-house investigators under section 447 of the
Companies Act 1985. These inquiries are not announced and the findings are
not published.
Although the DTI says it is still in discussions with the select committee,
little progress has been made towards implementing reform. Implementation of
the recommendation that the trade secretary should automatically apply for
the disqualification of directors who give false information to DTI
inspectors could have had a significant bearing on the Suter report for
example.
Instead the DTI appears happy to rest on its record. On the surface that
looks quite impressive. In the fiscal year 1991/92, there were 177
investigations under companies legislation, 155 of them unannounced
inquiries where the DTI called for company papers under section 447. Seven
teams of external inspectors were appointed and five inspectors' reports
were published during the year. Seventeen companies were wound-up. Eighteen
trials resulted in the conviction of 31 individuals. Ten people were
disqualified as directors for periods from three to 15 years. The DTI also
disclosed information and documents to regulatory bodies on 63 occasions.
The City, too, appears generally happy with the present system. Company
lawyers do not see reform as a priority and seem more concerned with
ensuring procedures are fair to those under investigation. Mrs Frances
Heaton head of the Takeover Panel, said that while the present system was
'clearly not ideal' there was a 'need to be realistic about what it is
trying to achieve'. Where there was a possibility of criminal charges,
inquiries had to proceed with great caution. It was difficult to see what
could be done to speed them up.
The Securities and Investment Board said there had been few problems with
recent investigations. The inquiries that gave rise to all the criticism
arose out of events dating back to before the 1986 Financial Services Act.
The Mirror Group Newspapers investigation would provide the first real test
of the system since the act came into force, but it was too early to say yet
that it was taking too long.
From the public's point of view, however, the DTI's record is less
satisfactory. The number of appointments of inspectors is very small
compared with the number of applications for investigations, 65 per cent of
which are now made by the public. The number of applications has risen
steadily in recent years from 441 in 1987/88 to 850 in 1991/92 but the
number of statutory investigations has only risen from 135 to 177 over the
same period. This has only fuelled criticism of inaction by the DTI.
Little progress appears to have been made either in speeding up the
procedure. The average time to complete a major investigation has fallen
from three years, eight months in the early 1980s to two years, four months
today. But delays in publication after an inquiry seem to have increased.
Regulators welcome the publication of interim reports as a useful
development, but no action has been taken on the committee's proposal that
inspectors' recommendations for prosecution or disciplinary action should be
contained in a separate appendix so that the bulk of a report can be
published quickly.
It may come down to a question of resources. The DTI investigations division
needs beefing up. While resources remain scarce, reform along the lines
recommended by the committee looks unlikely.

FT  09 MAR 93 / People: Binks leaves CSI; Jones leaves Lloyds Abbey Life
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Smith, the management consultant who masterminded the Isosceles bid
for Gateway in 1989, is to become chief executive of Cannon Street
Investments.
Smith replaces Robin Binks, the man who first introduced the accountant and
business consultant to CSI's board in September. The two met when Smith was
trying to organise the bid for Gateway and Binks helped Isosceles to secure
the finance for the bid.
Binks, who was informed of the board's decision to replace him about two
weeks ago, has been paid compensation believed to amount to a six figure
sum.
Tom Long, chairman of CSI, says the company is moving into a phase when
operational skills would become more important: 'That is where David's
skills lie.'
Binks, a former merchant banker who joined CSI in November 1990, had been
crucial to the group's debt reduction strategy involving the disposal or
closure of several subsidiaries. Under his tenure, disposals included the
flotation of Avonside, the housebuilder, the sale of 1.5m Betacom shares,
and the laundry group, Stalbridge.
CSI is now estimated to have debt of less than Pounds 35m, against a peak of
Pounds 100m.
*****
Gary Jones, marketing director of Lloyds Abbey Life since it was founded in
1988, is to leave the company at the end of this month.
A spokesman for the company said that Jones, who joined Abbey Life in 1986
from the brewing and retailing division of Grand Metropolitan, was not
moving to a specific job elsewhere, but had decided that he no longer wished
to continue working in life assurance.
Lloyds Abbey Life does not intend to appoint a replacement in the short
term, but will divide his responsibilities between the company's different
divisions.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: Compensation valid for NZ cheddar -
European Law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand cheddar imported into the European Community by one EC country
and then resold in other Community countries is entitled to monetary
compensation amounts (MCAs) when being resold in the Community, the European
Court of Justice ruled last week.
The case concerned the New Zealand Dairy Board and its subsidiary in
Germany, General Milk Products GmbH. Until 1984, the subsidiary had imported
cheddar, among other products, from New Zealand for resale within the
Community, and these resales benefited from MCAs.
MCAs were introduced by the Community to compensate for fluctuations in
export and import prices of agricultural products between the prices fixed
by the Community institutions and the real market prices.
In 1984, an agreement was reached between New Zealand and the Community,
whereby the regime for trade in cheese was changed. Instead of minimum
prices and quota restrictions on cheese imports into the Community, the new
arrangements relied solely on quota limits.
This change led the German customs to refuse the applicant company any MCAs
for the cheese it was seeking to export from Germany to other countries in
the Community.
The European Court ruled that the change in arrangements for the import of
cheese from New Zealand into the Community had not had any impact on the
granting of export MCAs.
The Court said that, in deciding to suspend the minimum prices, the
Commission must have found New Zealand prices and Community prices for
cheddar to be compatible. This had nothing to do with the grant of export
MCAs, which were aimed specifically at neutralising the consequences of
currency fluctuations on the movement of agricultural products within the
Community.
The Court therefore ruled in favour of General Milk Products but with one
proviso. Export MCAs were applicable to the transactions in question as long
as, like the GMP dealings, they were ordinary commercial transactions. MCAs
would not be granted to fictitious arrangements, intended only to claim the
benefit of MCAs.
This proviso was clearly aimed at underlining the Community's wish to stamp
out the fraudulent transactions that have been a feature of certain
agricultural markets within the Community in recent years.
C-8/92: General Milk Products GmbH v Haupzollamt Hamburg-Jonas, ECJ 3CH,
March 3 1993.
Other cases of interest
Among the many opinions of the Advocates-General, two cases look certain to
be of particular interest. They both concern the Community rules relating to
health warnings on cigarette packets.
Advocate-General Lenz found that Community rules required member states to
ensure that health warnings on cigarette packets covered 4 per cent of the
surface area of each packet. National authorities, however, are not entitled
to demand that health warnings cover a larger surface area than 4 per cent,
even if the domestic labelling requirements are more strict.
Advocate-General Lenz also found that the Community rules, as presently
constituted, only allowed for one health warning per cigarette packet. The
judgment of the Court will be awaited with interest by the cigarette
manufacturers.

Opinion of Advocate-General Lenz, March 2 1993.

FT  09 MAR 93 / People: Norcros shuffles its titles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norcros, the building products and packaging group, is switching Michael
Doherty to the post of executive chairman and doing away with the title
chief executive.
Doherty joined Norcros as chief executive five years ago - after it had
escaped the clutches of Williams Holdings - from Cope Allman.
He also took on the role of deputy chairman in 1989 when Julian Sheffield,
son of the founder, became chairman. Sheffield is stepping aside as chairman
but stays as a non-executive director.
Robert Alcock, who joined as finance director from Nabisco UK in October
1989, is being promoted to the new post of group managing director. Norcros
is seeking a replacement as finance director. According to Doherty: 'Robert
will look at the business from month to month and I will look at it
year-to-year.'
Although the changes are not a direct response to the Cadbury report,
Doherty says, some of the requirements mean that 'the role of chairman is
much more demanding'. As a 'virtually full-time' chairman of Norcros, he had
few other business interests. The main one was the chairmanship of Henlys,
the motor group. This proved rather onerous last year as it was fighting off
a hostile bid from T Cowie.
Norcros is making the post of deputy chairman non-executive and Anthony
Elliott, a merchant banker who has been on the board for six years, will
fill that role. He is also a director of SG Warburg and Bridon, the wire
rope maker.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Driving down car costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next week's Budget is expected to bring further changes in the tax treatment
of the company car. But whatever the chancellor decides there are ways in
which companies can reduce costs, according to a new guide* to company car
management.
Managing a car fleet and preparing budgets depends on keeping records of
previous performance. Manual records must include copies of all invoices
including the original purchase invoice and registration date. A full
service history can increase the sale price of the vehicle.
Several software packages are also available so careful choice needs to be
made to ensure you get the right one. These should allow you to compare
performance and cost with make, model, mileage and department.
Many companies allow drivers a free choice of vehicle within a price range
without giving consideration to the reliability or service costs. Incentives
to employees if they maintain their vehicles in good condition can help to
ensure they are looked after properly.
If you use an outside garage for servicing do not allow individual employees
to make a choice without vetting their selection and agreeing labour rates.
Try to use as few garages as possible to build up a good working
relationship and always ask if you can get a discount on parts.
Keep to the manufacturers' recommended service schedules though this does
not necessarily mean using main dealers. Main dealers can charge Pounds
25-Pounds 50 an hour for labour but other, still reputable, garages can
charge only Pounds 16-Pounds 18, even in central London.
Tight control must be kept of fuel bills. A fuel card can be used to keep
control of costs nationwide. The fuel card company will usually provide an
itemised bill twice a month. This not only controls unauthorised spending;
it reduces administration time and provides useful management information
about the efficiency of the car fleet.

terrorist damage - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Business tenants in leased premises must make sure that they are fully
protected under new insurance arrangements agreed by the Association of
British Insurers and the government to meet claims for terrorist damage,
London solicitors Hill Taylor Dickinson warn.
Landlords usually insure their leased buildings but pass on the cost to
their tenants. If the landlord does not top up the Pounds 100,000 basic
terrorist cover provided and the damage sustained is greater the tenant may
have to meet the cost of the repairs.
Worse still and depending on the terms of the lease, the tenant may have to
continue paying rent on a wrecked building and could lose the right to bring
the lease to an early end, Hill Taylor Dickinson advise.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A clearer view of the EC
 -Charles Batchelor begins a monthly series answering questions raised by
the single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE formal launch of the European single market on 1 January 1993 signalled
the most ambitious step towards European integration since the drawing up of
the Treaty of Rome in 1957.
In many areas, however, the creation of the single market was more apparent
than real, since legislation prompted by the Single European Act of 1987 has
been coming on stream for some time. The most notable changeover on 1
January was the switch to a new system of accounting for VAT and for
collecting trade statistics.
In the run-up to the creation of the single market companies were deluged
with advice from the government, consultants, accountants and advice
agencies on what action to take. Since 1 January the clamour has been
stilled but businesses are still coming to terms with the changes.
There are many sources of information open to businesses on the single
market both public and private but the FT believes that by highlighting some
of the issues which arise it will be providing a service to readers.
We may also be able to pinpoint areas where either the original EC directive
or subsequent national legislation has led to difficulties.
We therefore invite readers to write or fax any queries relating to doing
business in Europe or resulting from the creation of the single market. The
FT is happy to acknowledge the assistance of the London Chamber of Commerce
and Industry's European Information Centre in compiling this feature.
Write to Charles Batchelor, Single Market Q&amp;A, Number One, Southwark Bridge,
London SE1 9HL or Fax 071 873 3933.
Public contracts
Q: How can I find out about public contracts open for tender in other
members states? Can I bid for them?
A: Yes, any company based in the Community may bid for contracts advertised
in the Supplement to the Official Journal.
EC legislation governing public procurement requires public purchasers in
the member states to submit details of contracts for supplies, works,
utilities and services to the Commission for inclusion in the supplement.
This journal is known as the 'S series' and is published daily. It is
available on subscription from Her Majesty's Stationery Office.
You can consult all Official Journals at your local European Information
Centre. In addition, Tenders Electronic Daily, the on-line version of the
supplement, offers accurate and up-to-date information on contracts.
A number of organisations, including the European Information Centres,
operate a monitoring service whereby companies are notified of relevant
contracts.
Contracting authorities have a choice of three types of procedures.
Open procedure - any interested contractor may submit a tender. This is the
procedure which is most commonly followed.
Restricted procedure - only those contractors who have been through a
pre-qualification process are eligible and may be invited to tender.
Negotiated procedure - allows contracting authorities to consult contractors
of their choice and negotiate the terms of the contract with one or more of
them.
Public purchasers must advertise contracts above set minimum values. These
are Ecu200,000 (Pounds 165,000) for supplies and services, Ecu5m for public
works, Ecu600,000 for services in telecommunications and Ecu400,000 for
services in the water, energy and transport sectors.
What the rules mean
Q: I am familiar with the term 'EC Directive' but recently came across an
'EC regulation'. Can you tell me what the difference is?
A: There are five kinds of EC rule-making procedure. They are:
Regulations. These are directly enforceable laws applicable and binding in
the member states. In other words, no local laws need be passed for them to
be effective.
Directives. These are also legally binding but require further action by
member states. They lay down the intended results of legislation leaving it
to the individual member states as to how these aims are to be achieved and
the target date for implementation.
Decisions. These apply to member states but may apply to an individual or a
company (or any legal entity) and are legally binding. They are primarily
used to enforce competition policy decisions.
Recommendations and opinions. These are not legally binding but they do have
considerable political influence.
Notices. These are not really legislation, nor are they legally binding but
are generally intended to provide guidance. They are usually used to assist
companies in the field of competition.
Importing toys
Q: We import toys and sell them in the Community. What are the standards
that apply and are there any plans to tighten them further? In addition, how
do we prove we have attained the standard and carried out the necessary
testing?
A: The EC has ruled all toys should bear the CE (Communite Europeenne) mark
at the point of entry into the EC. It is recognised, however, that many
importers apply the CE mark after importation and, as far as we are aware,
this is accepted by many port authorities.
There is no specific procedure for testing products nor does any authority
formally award the CE mark.
The mark is a declaration that the toy complies with the requirements of the
EC legislation. It is the responsibility of the importer or manufacturer to
ensure this declaration is accurate. In the UK the toys may be subject to
checks by trading standards officers and, or customs.
To ensure the toys comply with EC rules, the importer/manufacturer may
decide to have the product independently tested in an accredited laboratory
within the EC - a list of EC-approved bodies is contained in the Official
Journal C264, 1992.
Samples are submitted for testing to the harmonised standard and any other
relevant standard. In the case of EC-type examinations, full manufacturing
and design details should also be submitted.
Toys which legitimately carry a CE mark may be circulated legally throughout
the Community. All member states have implemented the Toy Safety directive.
Selling by mail order
Q: I understand there are new VAT requirements for small companies involved
in distance selling. I sell by mail order and wonder how this will affect
me?
A: From the beginning of 1993 the rules changed. If you sell to customers in
other EC countries who are not VAT registered, you are responsible for the
payment of VAT in this country.
This ruling applies until the value of distance sales (which includes mail
order) to another EC country exceeds a specific threshold.
Member states have stipulated the following thresholds will apply to each
individual country and will be set in the currency of each country:
Ecu35,000 Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal and
Spain.
Ecu100,000 France, Germany, Netherlands and the UK.
When your sales surpass the threshold of any country, VAT becomes payable in
that country on any further sales and you are required to register for VAT
there. If you do not already have representation in the other member state,
you must appoint a tax representative who will be responsible for accounting
for VAT to the authorities on your behalf. This will usually be an
accountant.
Food packaging
Q: We are a UK-based company selling Danish foodstuffs. Is there any
European Community legislation governing the language employed on food
packaging? Would it be enough, for example, to place a notice in English
over the display cabinet describing the product and its contents?
A: The EC rules require food retailers to display information about their
products in a language which can be easily understood by customers. It is
unlikely that a general notice in English above the display cabinet would be
considered sufficient.
Your have three options to meet the directive: you could repackage the goods
using English-language packaging; you could apply English-language labels to
the original packaging; or you could have folders or pamphlets printed and
distributed with the foodstuffs in question.
This subject is covered by EC directive 79/112/CEE relating to the
labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the
ultimate consumer. The directive indicates the information which must be
provided on labels. The language question is covered by article 14.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Technology: Two heads are better than one - A growing
Japanese trend for international collaboration on R&amp;D
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A grey February afternoon in a London meeting room, a Cambridge research
team announced that it had demonstrated one of the holy grails of
electronics engineering. It had developed a single electron device, where a
'bit' of information could be stored by a single electron in a chip.
The announcement overshadowed one of the most innovative aspects of the
development: it was made by a joint Anglo-Japanese research team.
For Hitachi, it was the first time the company had conducted fundamental
research outside Japan, according to Akira Koizumi, managing director of
Hitachi Europe.
But this is a growing trend among Japanese companies. Cambridge's Cavendish
laboratories have collaborative agreements with both Toshiba and Hitachi to
conduct research into quantum electronics. And Sharp has set up its European
research centre on the Oxford Science Park.
Clive Bradley, managing director of Sharp Laboratories of Europe, believes
credence in these projects is growing within Japanese industry and
government. 'Generally speaking there is a perceived need to bring into
Japanese companies the kind of research experience that is done outside.
Building laboratories overseas and having good communications is the best
way of doing that,' he says.
Yutaka Kuwahara, general manager for Hitachi Europe's research and
development centre, emphasises the point. 'Discussion between people from
the same cultural background is not so deep. Researchers with different
backgrounds bring different attitudes.'
Hitachi had some track record in collaboration between Japanese and overseas
researchers before joining forces with Cambridge. Some 300 foreign
scientists had already passed through the doors of its Tokyo research
laboratory.
'About five years ago we believed - and we still believe - that
revolutionary technology could be done through international collaboration,'
explains Kuwahara. 'We thought industry would have difficulty in doing it on
its own - it needs to be a collaboration between theorists and industry.'
Hitachi ploughs Pounds 1m a year into its Cambridge laboratory, which pays
for seven staff, two from Japan and five from the UK. This comprises half
the joint development team, with the rest funded through UK academic
sources. Hitachi holds the patent on the single-electron device, but
Cambridge University will share in any financial returns from the
breakthrough.
The Toshiba Cambridge Research Centre, on the Cambridge Science Park, which
has been open since January 1991, has 11 staff, two of whom are Japanese.
The managing director is Michael Pepper, a Cambridge professor.
Sharp's laboratory, which has been open since March 1992, is by far the
largest of the three. It employs 42, including four Japanese researchers,
and has funds of Pounds 4m a year, out of Sharp's total R&amp;D funds of Pounds
500m. The most difficult thing in setting up the laboratories from scratch,
reports Bradley, was deciding the focus of the research.
'Sharp asked us to consider programmes in opto-electronics, artificial
intelligence and machine translation. Those were the broad categories,' he
recalls.
Cambridge's Cavendish laboratory and Hitachi faced a similar challenge. Four
years ago the research was centred on quantum devices: only as the research
progressed did it become focused on the single-electron memory.
Researchers argue the collaboration has been fruitful, though not
necessarily easy.
'Science is fairly universal,' points out Haroon Ahmed, professor of
micro-electronics at the Cavendish Laboratory. 'But there are different ways
of doing things.'
The Hitachi team gets together once a week to discuss the extent of its
research. 'We also argue about our results,' adds Ahmed.
'I am very interested in the difference between the Japanese and the UK way
of doing research,' explains Yasuo Ikawa, deputy managing director of the
Toshiba Cambridge Research Centre. 'As far as basic research is concerned
the UK has strengths historically. Japan, I believe, has strengths in
developmental research. We have to think about combining those differences.'
Ikawa believes that in Japan researchers take a 'me too' attitude to
research. When a theory is first proposed, he says, researchers are
sceptical. But once the theory appears plausible, then every company takes
it up. In the UK, on the other hand, researchers do not want to work in
areas where rivals are working. 'That is why there is so much creative and
original research done in the UK,' argues Ikawa.
Bradley believes that in Japan more emphasis is placed on quantifying
targets, even in basic research. 'I have to try to come to an appropriate
blend of individualism in creative research and Japanese management skills,'
he says. 'Management skills are not something that comes naturally to highly
innovative scientists.'
The trick, believes Bradley, is not to suppress the individualism that
persuaded Sharp to invest in British scientists in the first place. And, he
adds: 'We've been pleasantly surprised to see how researchers have responded
to targets, even if they're five or 10 years away.'
Communications hold the key, believes Kuwahara. At Hitachi, relationships
were introduced at every level of research - between researchers and
scientists as well as managers. Research programmes were used to send people
from the UK to Japan to work in Hitachi's laboratories, where work is done
on the related field of atomic manipulation. 'Of course, it is not easy,'
says Kuwahara. 'But this sort of human communication is very important.'
Bradley goes even further. He believes good communications between
researchers in Japan and those in Oxford are crucial to the team's success.
Researchers in the two centres have a 'very active day-to-day relationship',
he says.
Technology also aids researchers in forging closer links. Electronic mail,
telephones and facsimile machines are used to keep researchers in the UK in
contact with those in Japan.
Sharp has a global network for telephone and fax calls. Looking to the
future, Bradley believes computer-to-computer communications will also be
established. But this will create its own problems. Much of the data held in
the principal research centre are in Japanese and would need translating.
Bradley points out the culture of Japanese companies such as Sharp prevents
the research laboratories from feeling cut off from the main body of
researchers. 'It's not the Japanese way to leave us isolated. We're all part
of the family now. They work very hard at that.'
For Bradley, the links between Oxford and Japan are particularly important
because the Japanese company is Bradley's biggest customer.
Although the European offices of Sharp funded the Pounds 9.9m capital outlay
for the research facility - Sharp in the UK provided 80 per cent with
France, Germany and Spain providing the rest - it will be some time before
they will be able to take the Oxford developments and incorporate them into
products.
'In five to 10 years' time we will be looking more to European countries,'
adds Bradley.
For Toshiba, too, it is Japan that funds the research. But, says Ikawa, the
head office gives the research team a certain amount of autonomy. 'Toshiba
Tokyo's concern is the research results.'
In spite of the difficulties, Hitachi's Koizumi believes the benefits of
international collaboration have outweighed any problems. 'We believe this
is a good model for a different way of doing research,' he says. 'It's the
opposite side of the brain drain.'

<TEXT>
THE turmoil in the information technology business is plain to see. But the
reasons why so many different kinds of IT company are in trouble is less
obvious. A whole litany of causes can be invoked to explain why companies
are losing money, cutting staff, losing the loyalty of their customers and
so on.
The problem, as Charles Morris and Charles Ferguson point out in the current
issue of the Harvard Business Review, is that the usual explanations are
inadequate.
Certainly the recession is taking its toll throughout the developed world,
but some companies, Intel and Microsoft among them, continue to increase
their sales and profits despite the devastation.
The move to 'open' or industry standard systems has promoted lower prices
for both open and proprietary equipment. But the open systems revolution has
not gone that far yet.
The shift away from mainframes has also affected the traditional computer
industry - companies such as IBM and Unisys. But the majority of companies
which rely on mainframes will continue to use them. There is simply no
cost-effective substitute to mainframes for some applications. Certainly not
client-server networks.
Some companies, such as Digital Equipment, failed to exploit personal
computers early enough. But personal computer makers and distributors have
also been having a rough time as prices plumb the depths, taking profit
margins with them.
Clearly, there is a crying need for a 'grand unified theory' of the great
computer industry disaster to serve both as warning and encouragement.
Morris and Ferguson, authors of a soon-to-be-published book entitled
Computer Wars: How the West Can Win in a Post IBM World, do the next best
thing. They suggest a 'grand unified theory' of success.
'Competitive success flows to the company that manages to establish
proprietary architectural control over a broad, fast-moving competitive
space,' they argue.
In other words, the company that owns, maintains and continues to develop a
design which becomes an industry standard should be a winner.
Their explanation holds good for Intel, Microsoft and Novell. Intel's
microprocessors, Microsoft's operating system and Novell's networking
software are all examples of proprietary designs which have achieved
dominance and propelled their owners to seemingly untouchable success.
Morris and Ferguson are not afraid to take several heretical lines:
proprietary systems, they say, serve customers and technological progress
better than open designs, which become stultified by the need to settle on
compromise solutions. But proprietary designs have to be vigorously
defended, and this propels technological progress forward.
They also argue against the 1980s wisdom that companies should avoid broad,
cost-sensitive markets in favour of high-price niches: 'In fact, the broad
market is the strategic high ground, if it is covered by a proprietary
architecture. Niche product vendors can make profits, but they will remain
minor players.'
Experience of IBM and its all-pervasive System 360 mainframe computer
architecture or Matsushita and its victory over Sony with the VHS video
recorder format suggest that Morris and Ferguson's thesis has much to
recommend it.
They say nothing about the role of luck in the equation, however. Intel and
Microsoft have made the most of their proprietary architectures but they
were handed all the advantages by IBM. When it should have held on to at
least part of its control of its microprocessor or operating system design,
IBM gave it away and unwittingly sowed the seeds of today's PC price wars.
Luck, of course, favours prepared minds and Intel and Microsoft were more
prepared than most. But until creators of 'grand unified theories' find a
way of factoring luck into their equations, they will remain incomplete
explanations of business success.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Nationalists defend support for
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONALIST parties were thrown on to the defensive at Westminster last
night after they reached an agreement with the government and unsuccessfully
opposed the other parties on the composition of the European Committee of
the regions.
Labour MPs accused the four Plaid Cymru and three Scottish Nationalist MPs
of doing a 'grubby deal' with the Tories, at the end of a day of negotiation
in which the government looked vainly for a way of averting defeat.
But the nationalist parties said they had won a better outcome for Scotland
and Wales than Labour had done.
Late last night Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, expressed astonishment at
the 'deal', which he said was 'clearly a matter of great public interest'.
Letters from Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, and Mr David Hunt, the
Welsh secretary, went to the nationalist parties yesterday afternoon, saying
that Scotland and Wales would have greater representation on the 24-strong
UK group in the committee than warranted by their populations.
The ministers also promised that representation, to be based on shortlists
drawn up by the parties, would include the minor parties.
Mrs Margaret Ewing, of the Scottish National Party, said her party had
secured government agreement for at least six Scottish seats on the
committee, while Plaid Cymru said the government had promised that the three
or four Welsh members of the committee would reflect the strength of the
main political parties in Wales.
Plaid Cymru also won a pledge to set up a 'reporting back' forum which will
meet in Wales and include representatives of Welsh councils, Welsh MPs and
MEPs and the Welsh representatives on the committee.
Mr Smith later called for the publication of the correspondence between
ministers and the nationalist parties.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: The story of three men in a vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCARCELY HAD the echo died from a chorus of ministers calling at the weekend
for loyalty in Tory ranks yesterday than the divisions, and plotting,
re-opened over Maastricht.
Conservative MPs divide into three broad camps: the die-hard Euro-rebels to
whom defeating Maastricht is top priority and who want to exploit every
chance to de-rail the bill; the government loyalists who want Maastricht
approved and are prepared to fight for it; and the frustrated MPs in the
middle - who want most to turn parliament's attention to other business.
THE DIE-HARD: MR Michael Spicer, MP for Worcestershire South, voted against
the government last night. The unofficial whip for Tory Euro-sceptics was
far from repentant yesterday - in spite of the appeals for party unity, from
the prime minister downwards, ringing in his ears.
'Some of the speeches have actually exacerbated the matters,' he said. 'The
attempt to denigrate, to belittle and in some cases to even misinterpret
what is a very sincerely held belief - and also highly representative of
public opinion - is in itself damaging to party unity.'
He will not identify individuals but it is clear that personal antagonism
remains. 'Certainly there are ministers and party functionaries who are
going beyond what is sensible in terms of the rhetoric they are using - it
is counter-productive.'
The Euro-sceptics still be-lieve opposition to Maastricht is increasing, in
spite of signs of frustration in their ranks.
There is a defensiveness, however. Mr Spicer, a former minister, voted for
the 1986 Single European Act, which increased the powers of Brussels. In
retrospect he would want changes to that legislation. But, he says: 'There
is a very great distinction between a treaty and piece of legislation which
aims at trying to strengthen a common market - the single European act - and
one which overtly sets out to set up a united states of Europe.'
THE LOYALIST: Mr Ian Taylor, MP for Esher, voted with the government last
night. A leading member of the 'positive Europeans' group of Tory MPs, he
blends strong support for the treaty with frustration at the activities of
Euro-sceptics in his party.
'I think their collective behaviour is absurd. The only beneficiaries are
the Labour party and the Liberals, and the damage inflicted to the
government and the chances of economic recovery are very considerable,' he
said yesterday.
'The case can be made for its being honourable to oppose the government on a
point of principle, but to attempt to undermine the government on a point of
procedure, when the effect is to delay other measures the government wants
to bring forward and to give satisfaction to Labour, is inept.'
The commitment to the treaty from government and from business leads him to
emphasise how vital ratification is. He has not only voted for the
government throughout, but has occasionally intervened in the extended
debates to make the pro-Maastricht argument and contrast Labour's readiness
to prolong discussion with its professed support for the treaty.
So far, he says, the government has handled the bill 'fairly well', but he
believes that the time has come to force the pace of parliamentary
discussion.
THE SIMPLY FED-UP: Mr Michael Clark, MP for Rochford, also voted with the
government. He opposes the Maastricht treaty but by yesterday, his
exasperation at the hours devoted to its ratification were surfacing
publicly.
'The government will win slowly and if the government is going to win, well,
let's for God's sake get this thing out of the way as quickly as possible,'
he said.
So he would not vote to stop the government getting its business - and would
not back an amendment like Labour's last night on the Committee of the
Regions, because of the extra delay it would cause.
Yet his sympathy for Euro-sceptic colleagues is still strong. 'They have
been consistent and they have been honourable and they believe strongly what
they are doing. I don't have any derogatory thoughts about them at all.'
Appeals to loyalty may have had an impact, Mr Clark hinted - but he denied
that lay behind his latest decisions.
'The prime minster has a right to a certain amount of loyalty from people
who stood on the Conservative ticket at the last election. It doesn't please
me at all not to have given him support these last two or three months. The
government has a right to get its business.'
He promised: 'I'm not sniping on the sidelines, I wont take part in
guerrilla tactics.'
Mr Clark, who has backed the principle of greater free trade in Europe,
listed all the other problems still facing the government - the recession,
privatisation of British Rail, British Coal and Post Office to name but
some.
'All this is being pushed back and it is being pushed further and further.
This time next year we will be half way through this parliament and all we
will have done is Maastricht, Maastricht, Maastricht.'

THE BRITISH Waterways Board is to have its efficiency probed by the
Monopolies and and Mergers Commission, Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate
affairs minister, announced last night.
He said in a Commons written reply the move was part of the commission's
regular programme of efficiency studies of publicly bodies.
It will investigate the way the board, which looks after Britain's canals,
carries out its functions. It will see if the board can increase efficiency,
reduce costs and improve quality of service.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE IN FIVE Conservative MPs believes government plans to set up a Personal
Investment Authority should be scrapped in favour of statutory control of
the personal financial services industry.
A survey of MPs conducted for IFA Promotion, an organisation representing
independent financial advisers, also showed such a course of action would be
backed by 83 per cent of Labour MPs and 50 per cent of MPs from all parties.
Two thirds of Tory MPs and 40 per cent of MPs from all parties would favour
establishing the PIA to allow self-regulation to prove itself.
Under current proposals the PIA would be set up under the Securities and
Investments Board to regulate the personal financial services sector.
The figures were based on a sample of 100 MPs who were interviewed between
January 26 and February 10.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welcome for rail franchise interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 70 private-sector groups have expressed an interest in operating
rail passenger services under the franchise arrangements planned by the
government, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told the Commons
yesterday.
He said it was 'extremely encouraging' that they included more than 20
management-employee buy-out teams.
Mr MacGregor confirmed that British Rail would decide by Easter how to spend
the Pounds 150m allocated to it to lease new rolling stock. British Rail
would decide the lines on which the new stock would operate, he said.
Denying Labour charges that passenger services were being run down prior to
privatisation, Mr MacGregor stressed that investment was at levels not
equalled since the 1960s.
Investment would continue at a high level next year, he stressed.
The transport secretary also ruled out any plans to use British Rail pension
cash to subsidise privatisation, denouncing in the Commons what he called
'mischievous and quite unwarranted scares'.
Shadow transport secretary Mr John Prescott said there was a Pounds 4bn
surplus in the BR pension fund and sought an assurance that no subsidies
would come from the surplus.
Mr MacGregor pledged: 'I give a complete assurance that in no way would this
government countenance the BR pension scheme fund being used for purposes
other than paying BR pensions.'
Dewe Rogerson, the public relations consultancy, has been appointed by the
government to advise it on a marketing strategy for the privatisation of
British Rail.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Position on EC seats still unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night declined to clear up confusion over how the six
new British seats to the European parliament are to be allocated, saying
only that it expected to come to a view 'at a very early date,' David Owen
writes.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the foreign office minister, acknowledged the matter
was 'extremely urgent' but said the government was still considering how
best to proceed.
Mr George Robertson, shadow foreign office minister, said such an answer was
not good enough with the next European elections only 56 weeks away. The
response was another example of the 'dazed confusion' the government was in
over Europe, he added.
It was decided at last year's European summit in Edinburgh to give Britain
six more MEPs, bringing the total to 87. In December prime minister John
Major indicated Britain would retain the 'first past the post system' for
the 1994 European elections.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Inquiry urged into Hoover offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NIGEL Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, yesterday called
for a department of trade and industry inquiry into Hoover's 'free flights'
offer, which he said was the subject of 'tens of thousands of complaints
from customers'.
Condemning the promotion as a 'fiasco,' he said the inquiry should be able
to 'recommend compensation for any unreasonable conditions or behaviour by
Hoover's agents'.
Hoover yesterday accused the Daily Express of 'distortion and
misrepresentation of facts' in a story which featured several instances of
dissatisfied customers, based on a BBC TV consumer affairs programme
broadcast last night.
But the company refused to say how many people had applied for free flights
in either of its two promotions, nor would it disclose the number of people
who may have travelled so far. The offers have closed, but the last possible
date for a flight is April 1994.
said Mr Griffiths. 'Hoover is shrouding far too much of this in secrecy.
There is considerable concern that they should come clean. The fact that
they are not giving the public even simple information leads one to question
their good faith.'
Hoover ran two 'free flights' sales promotions last year. Customers spending
Pounds 100 or more on a Hoover product could apply for flight vouchers to
European or US destinations. The vouchers were to be processed by several
travel agents hired by Hoover.
Mr Mike Dunkley of Your Leisure, one of the agents, said yesterday 'many
thousands' had booked and travelled on the schemes. He said he was
contractually bound by Hoover not to disclose precise figures.
The flights in both schemes were 'subject to availability'. In the last
resort Hoover is legally able to specify the date, time and destination of
the flights.
Mr Keith Richards, a lawyer with the Consumers' Association said yesterday:
'Hoover seems to be getting rid of applicants because they have not
correctly filled in the application form or because some of the applications
are claimed to have been lost in the post.
'People are disappointed because they did not get what they want and were
enticed by a very clever marketing ploy,' he said.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown attacks BES 'misuse'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR YESTERDAY called for immediate action to end 'misuse' of business
expansion schemes as it stepped up its attacks on the government for not
standing up to the banks and big business.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, targeted BES-linked schemes which he
said could cost the Treasury Pounds 400m and was making 'the misery of the
repossessed homeless into a tax-avoidance opportunity for top-rate taxpayers
and the banking establishment'.
Claiming that BES companies launched in the last 10 days alone would cost
the Treasury Pounds 160m, Mr Brown promised that Labour would try to put a
stop to them by tabling amendments to the post-Budget Finance Bill if the
government did not act.
Mr Brown said the failure of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to take
action against lending institutions - typically banks and building societies
 -was either 'incompetence or a failure to stand up to the vested interests
close to the Conservative party'.
Under the business expansion scheme lending institutions with repossessed
properties on their books are able to transfer the property to a BES
company, which then rents it out for five years before selling it back to
the original lender.
Investors buy shares in the BES company, receiving tax relief of 40p in the
pound if they pay income tax at the top rate, making an effective net
investment of 60p.
Six months later the institution makes loans of typically 74p for each pound
invested. Shares in the BES company are the only security for the loan and
there is no recourse to the investor's other assets.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM ponders wounding Maastricht
defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S opponents have drawn blood. Last night Mr John Major's
government suffered its first defeat on the Maastricht treaty. It was also,
incidentally, the first parliamentary defeat since Mr Major walked into
Downing Street in November 1990. It was humiliating for the prime minister.
It was not fatal - for the treaty or for the government.
The passage by the combined forces of the opposition parties and Tory
Euro-sceptics of an obscure and, of itself, relatively unimportant amendment
to the Maastricht legislation has two effects.
The first is to deliver yet another blow to a weak and uncertain government.
The ecstatic reaction of the Tory rebels in the Commons chamber when the
vote was announced underlined again that Mr Major cannot command his own
party. He has a paper majority of 20. But 26 Tories voted against him and
nearly 20 abstained.
Just two days earlier he had made a strong and deliberately public plea for
the unity he needs to restore his authority. His most senior ministers had
warned that the government's entire programme - from action to tackle crime
to further reforms of the education system - was being jeopardised by the
parliamentary logjam over Maastricht.
The diehard opponents of further European integration on the Tory
backbenches rewarded their leader with an equally public slap in the face.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats, though both committed to the eventual
ratification of the treaty, decided that they could not pass up the chance
of delivering another kick to the government.
The second effect of the defeat is to prolong still further the debate on
ratification in the House of Commons. Under the arcane procedures of
Westminster another chunk of parliamentary time must now be added to the
debate among MPs. This report stage will follow the detailed line-by-line
examination of the legislation in its present committee stage.
The actual substance of the amendment is hardly relevant. It is designed to
ensure that British representatives on the EC's new Committee of the Regions
will be chosen from elected local councillors. The government had wanted
them to be appointees, but was ready to concede if it had thought the main
opposition parties would back down.
So the corrosive debate will now continue until well into the summer - and
perhaps beyond. Only the hardest of the hardline opponents of the treaty
believe that it will in the end fall. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, and
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, are both publicly pledged to
its passage.
If the two opposition leaders attempted to renege on that commitment they
would split their own parties. Many Liberal Democrats feel deeply uneasy
about Mr Ashdown calling one day for the government to speed up ratification
and the next voting to delay it. There are 100 Labour MPs who would defy
their leaders if they judged they were being asked to wreck the treaty.
But Mr Major knows now that the speed of the legislation cannot be dictated
by the government. He is totally reliant on the goodwill of the opposition -
particularly the Liberal Democrats - to secure his timetable for
ratification. Neither Mr Smith nor Mr Ashdown will make life easy.
Before last night's vote, MPs had already spent about 100 hours debating the
legislation. It will need the same again to complete the committee stage.
The new report stage could take another two or three weeks.
Then the bill has to go to the House of Lords. The government's business
managers will have to dump still more of its domestic legislation if the
process is to be completed by July or August. The agony might be prolonged
until October. There may be yet further defeats. The opposition parties are
committed to the inclusion of the social chapter. Some of the Tory
Euro-sceptics now seem so detached from their own party that they may do
anything to wreck the treaty. They will be bought off only by the referendum
Mr Major has consistently rejected.
As he contemplates defeat this morning, the prime minister will draw comfort
from the fact that in the end the large pro-European majority at Westminster
will give him his legislation. But who now could refer to Maastricht as
'game, set and match'.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Film production gains from a weak pound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE growing signs of life in the British film production industry,
largely because of the weakness of the pound against the dollar.
Mr Sydney Samuelson, the British film commissioner, just back from meeting
senior executives of all the main studios in Los Angeles, found evidence of
renewed interest.
'There was 10 times the level of interest this time compared with a year
ago,' said Mr Samuelson, who heads the National Film Commission, a body
funded by the government.
The commission took front-page advertisements in the Hollywood trade press,
highlighting the way in which British costs have come down because of the
pound's fall.
Mr Samuelson provided real examples such as a two-person sound crew for 60
hours, or six days, shooting in the Highlands of Scotland which cost a total
of Dollars 2,700 on September 2 last year but by February 15 would only have
cost Dollars 1,917. The savings hold true for every category from
non-speaking extras to make-up artists.
When Mr Samuelson went for meetings with studio executives the
advertisements were often on their desks.
'They like working with British technicians and they like shooting in the
UK. But when it's too expensive they are prepared to compromise and go
somewhere else,' said Mr Samuelson, who believes the government is now more
sympathetic to the industry.
Last year 48 feature films went before the cameras in the UK - three less
than in 1991. Mr Samuelson is more optimistic for this year.
The film commission hopes, for example, that a film about King Arthur and
the Round Table will start shooting at Pinewood studios in June and that
part of a new film based on The Three Musketeers will be based in the UK.
A Dollars 40m-a-year NBC television series, Jewels, set in the UK, will be
filmed in the Irish republic because of better incentives.
The UK film industry hopes that more encouragement from the government may
be on the way, either in next week's or the autumn Budget.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Selling shirts cost banker his job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ASSISTANT vice-president of Chemical Bank, sacked for allegedly importing
2,000 shirts from Hong Kong and selling some of them around the office, was
fairly dismissed, an industrial tribunal has ruled.
Mr Andrew Morgan, who was responsible for financial and regulatory reporting
in the US bank's Cardiff office until he was sacked in June 1992, had
claimed unfair dismissal. He told the tribunal the import and sale of the
shirts was a one-off transaction and that many other employees were also
conducting businesses with management's tacit approval.
The bank's code of ethics, part of every employee's contract, says written
permission is needed before an employee can be involved in an outside
business. Mr Morgan had failed to get permission, the tribunal heard.
The written conclusions of the tribunal say Mr Morgan's activities first
came to light during an investigation by the bank's management into travel
and expenses claims. A file was discovered in the desk of Mr Lawrence Watts,
a colleague of Mr Morgan's, which contained import certificates, shipping
instructions and invoices for what appeared to be an importing business
called Morgan and Watts.
Mr Watts resigned after a disciplinary hearing but Mr Morgan initially
denied being involved in any concerted business effort. He said a student
from Hong Kong had asked him and Mr Watts to finance some imports and they
had agreed. A total of 2,000 garments had been imported but very few had
been sold. He had himself sold some shirts around the office, but most had
been sold by his girlfriend to non-employees. He said he had never used the
bank's telephones or fax machines.
Mr Morgan was offered the chance to resign after being found in breach of
the company's code of ethics. When he refused he was dismissed for gross
misconduct.
Mr Morgan argued at the tribunal that the dismissal was unfair because he
had not been running a business but had only been involved in a one-off
deal. This, he said, had been concluded in March 1991 with the full
knowledge and tacit approval of management in his department.
The tribunal concluded that it was immaterial whether the import and sale of
the shirts had been a one-off transaction. It also found there was
inadequate evidence to support Mr Morgan's claim that management did not
enforce the code strictly.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Red tape task force to survey 500 small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government task force seeking to reduce red tape is to survey 500 small
businesses on their views about European Community regulations, Charles
Batchelor writes.
The task force, which has responsibility for EC legislation, plans to
recommend improvements in the way in which EC member states negotiate new
laws as well as the way they are implemented and enforced in the UK.
The survey will ask small businesses to identify regulations which are
particularly burdensome.
It will consist of a postal questionnaire followed by a telephone interview
 -the aim is to make sure that the survey itself does not become an
additional burden.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Easing of audit requirement backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN two thirds of bankers, businesses and accountants support a
relaxation of the statutory audit of small companies, a survey by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales shows.
The British Bankers Association, Standard Chartered and Barclays, which have
traditionally been opposed to removing restrictions, all now support some
relaxation of the requirement.
The findings come in response to a consultation paper urging that only
companies with a turnover of more than Pounds 300,000be required to have an
annual audit.
There were 188 responses to the paper, of which 44 opposed any form of
relaxation. Most called for the retention of some financial information
beyond turnover in exempted companies.
The results will put renewed pressure on the Department of Trade and
Industry, which is expected to issue a consultation document on the auditing
of small companies in the next few weeks.
The institute last year called for the requirement for an annual audit to be
applied only to companies with a turnover of more than Pounds 300,000 a
year.
Since the 1900 Companies Act all limited liability companies in the UK - now
1.1m - have been required to be audited every year.
Most of the professional bodies representing auditors and many
small-business organisations have called for a reform of the audit
requirement, which is seen as costly and irrelevant.
Even the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, which has
traditionally opposed relaxation, appears to have softened its attitude in
the last few months.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the minister for corporate affairs, said late last year
that he was in favour of relaxing the requirement. His predecessor, Mr John
Redwood, announced a review of the small company audit early in 1992.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Trident costs disputed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence will come under pressure this week to clarify its
arrangements for obtaining Trident strategic missiles from the US, following
a report that US defence cuts could raise the cost of the programme to
Britain by more than Pounds 200m.
The report by the British American Security Information Council, an
independent lobby group, says reduced production plans by the US navy would
increase the unit cost of missiles by Dollars 13m to Dollars 49m (Pounds
34m).
Britain has already paid for many of the missiles it requires to equip four
submarines - thought to be about 70. The missiles will be drawn from a
shared pool and serviced in the US.
The report says a conservative estimate of the extra cost of missiles
remaining to be paid for by the UK is between Dollars 221m and Dollars 312m.
The Ministry of Defence yesterday rejected this figure as 'completely
unrealistic'. It did not yet have conclusive information about the impact of
the US changes on Britain's costs but said the increase would not be
significant 'and could be nothing'.
Mr David Clark, Labour party defence spokesman, said he was 'alarmed' by the
report.
The all-party Commons defence committee is due to question officials about
the progress of the Trident nuclear deterrent programme tomorrow. Last year
it estimated the Trident missile cost - not counting warheads, which will be
British-made - at Pounds 988m. The report says the US is thought to have
covered at least 20 per cent of the UK's share of the costs until now.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Lang to unveil Scots constitutional plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEASURES TO improve the way Scotland is governed
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
without conceding the creation of a Scottish assembly or parliament - are to
be unveiled this afternoon by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary.
They include proposals to increase the scope of the Scottish grand
committee, which includes all 72 Scottish MPs and to devolve more
administrative powers from London to the Scottish Office.
The grand committee is likely to handle at least some sessions of Scottish
questions to the Scottish Office ministers and to debate non-contentious
Scottish legislation. The Scottish Office could take responsibility for
training from the Department of Employment.
Accompanying the package should be an announcement that some civil servants
dealing with the regulation of North Sea oil in the Department of Trade and
Industry will move to Aberdeen.
The package, contained in a consultation paper, is certain to be attacked by
Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party. Even people
associated with the government concede that it may not win it many friends.
Yet the widespread view in Scotland is that the government will probably get
away with it.
The package is the fulfilment of a statement by Mr John Major last February
that while ruling out any change to the union of Scotland and England, he
would 'take stock' after the election.
It was a sensible precaution because at that stage it seemed likely that
even if the Tories won the election they would lose many of their nine seats
in Scotland.
In the event the Tories took two seats in the election and raised their 24
per cent share of the Scottish vote by nearly two points.
The government is going ahead with the move partly because Mr Lang has made
conciliation and consultation the hallmarks of his administration since the
election, and partly because he believes he can outflank the opposition.
After the election a cross-party organisation called Scotland United was
formed to keep up the fight for constitutional change, but its
demonstrations soon fizzled out.
Mr Lang knows, however, that nothing he does will satisfy the
pro-devolutionists, or assuage the nationalists. But he believes his
proposals are enough to keep the constitutional issue off the boil.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Calls for Welsh assembly rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUNT, the Welsh secretary, yesterday rejected vigorous calls for an
elected Welsh assembly made at a meeting in Cardiff of the Welsh grand
committee of MPs, the first time the committee has met outside Westminster.
Demands for an assembly, led by Mr Neil Kinnock, former Labour leader, and
Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, dominated the committee's debate on
the structure of government in Wales.
Mr Davies said an assembly was needed to correct the 'democratic deficit,'
as only six of the 38 Welsh constituencies are represented by Conservatives.
The Welsh secretary, who in a white paper last week outlined plans for 21
unitary authorities to replace the eight county councils and 37 district
councils, said he sought to move forward with local government reforms on a
basis of consensus. An assembly 'would reduce the influence of the unitary
authorities'.
Mr Davies, MP for Caerphilly, said unitary authorities only made sense with
a strategic decision-making body accountable to the people of Wales.
The grand committee, a standing committee of the Commons, includes all MPs
representing Welsh constituencies as well as five nominated members.
Yesterday's meeting was boycotted by Wales's only Liberal Democrat MP, Mr
Alex Carlile, as a protest at the lack of an assembly and on the grounds
that the committee was an undemocratic way of dealing with local government
reform.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Shifts in the pattern of poverty: Paul Cheeseright and Chris
Tighe examine the funding battle as the map of assisted areas is redrawn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INNER London and parts of southern England are soon likely to be labelled as
assisted areas by the government, opening the way for companies in those
areas to qualify for both government and EC subsidies.
The Department of Trade and Industry is redrawing the assisted areas map for
the first time since 1984 and EC limits on the proportion of a country's
population that can be designated may mean the withdrawal of some regional
assistance to areas in Wales, the Midlands and north east England.
Since 1984 the assisted areas have received additional investment of about
Pounds 3.5bn in derelict land grant and European regional development fund
allocations, according to figures obtained from ministers by Mr Alan
Milburn, the Labour MP for Darlington.
The department is struggling to adjudicate between competing claims from
across Great Britain for a place on the map. But the adjudication will not
be completed before the government has assessed the economic impact of the
programme of coal mine closures.
The problems with coal policy have delayed completion of the redrawn map,
originally expected at the end of last year. Now the department says it will
not appear before mid-April at the earliest.
More than 1,800 submissions have been made to the department from local
authorities, development agencies, training and enterprise councils, local
university departments and even parish councils, in an ever lengthening
parade of poverty.
Although the official deadline for submissions was September 30 last year,
efforts to put pressure on Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister in charge
of the redrawing, have continued unabated. Last week Birmingham Chamber of
Commerce told him that its area deserved not just intermediate but full
development status - that is, a wider range of subsidies than it may now
receive.
A place on the map means acknowledgement of industrial decline, hence the
present concentration of assisted areas in the Midlands and the north, Wales
and Scotland.
The difficulty for the department is that the map can include no more than
35 per cent of Great Britain's population. The department will have to judge
whether unemployment in southern England is merely cyclical and it will have
to decide how deep-seated is the local economic effect of coal mine
closures. It will also have to assess whether traditional industrial areas,
recession notwithstanding, have arrested their decline.
On such considerations it is possible to predict likely changes on the map.
For the first time parts of inner London and the east Thames corridor may be
included. North Nottinghamshire has a strong claim. So too have some coastal
areas, the strongest candidates being around Skegness in Lincolnshire;
Yarmouth, Harwich and Southend in Suffolk and Essex; Thanet, the Medway area
and Folkestone in a swathe of Kent stretching to Maidstone; and, in the
south, Brighton, Hastings and the Isle of Wight.
To keep within the EC guidelines such inclusions will mean the removal of
areas of relative economic recovery. Current thinking tends towards the
deletion of Cardiff, Newport and Neath in south Wales; Shotton and Wrexham
in north Wales; Darlington in the north east; and Corby, Kidderminster and
Telford in the Midlands.
Mr Milburn said yesterday his figures illustrated how the loss of assisted
area status put in jeopardy additional sources of investment.
Since 1984, for example, the Darlington area has received nearly three times
as much investment from derelict land grant (Pounds 3.4m) and EC regional
development funds (Pounds 7.6m) as from regional assistance (Pounds 4.3m).

FT  09 MAR 93 / Birt saved 'just Pounds 810' tax: Hussey and Barnett pledge
support for BBC director-general
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT, the BBC director-general, claims today that he saved only
Pounds 810 in tax in 1991 by being paid his BBC salary through his private
company, John Birt Productions.
Details of his tax affairs, disclosed in a letter to The Times, follow an
independent investigation of the affairs of John Birt Productions by Ernst &amp;
Young, the accountancy firm.
The letter from Mr Birt and supporting statements from the BBC follow
further press coverage of the affair and comments by Mr John Watts, chairman
of the Commons Treasury committee, that the Inland Revenue should have 'a
very close look' at Mr Birt's tax position.
In his first full statement on the affair Mr Birt said the benefits were 'a
close involvement in determining the nature of the work I should do and the
flexibility and mobility of having my own company pension scheme'. He said
the tax advantages were modest.
In its assessment of the accounts of John Birt Productions in the year to
August 1991 Ernst &amp; Young said that the total turnover of Pounds 163,141 not
only included the reimbursement of specific expenses incurred on BBC
business but also contributions to his company pension fund.
'Commentators have wrongly assumed that Mr Birt's company has been used
largely as a vehicle to reduce his taxable income. This is not the case,' it
said.
Ernst &amp; Young said that in 1991, the last year for which figures are
available, Mr Birt would have been liable for income tax and national
insurance contributions of Pounds 45,551 if he had been a BBC employee.
In the event he and his wife Jane paid Pounds 41,616 - a total saving of
Pounds 3,935. After deducting the company's accountancy and administration
costs 'the net benefit for the Birt household was Pounds 810 for the year'.
Mr Birt said that day-to-day expenses incurred on BBC business were paid by
John Birt Productions and charged to the BBC. This inflated the company's
turnover and apparent level of expenses. He added that personal benefits
received from the company were benefits in kind and liable for tax.
He said that he accepted it was inappropriate for the director-general of
the BBC not to be an employee of the corporation and added that 'long
familiarity with contractual arrangements of this sort' had not prepared him
for the 'dismay and unease that news of them generated'.
Mr Marmaduke Hussey, BBC chairman, and Lord Barnett, vice-chairman,
described Mr Birt in a statement of support as 'a man of integrity and
conviction' who had been subjected to a 'series of unfounded slurs'.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Engineering halts decline in orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORDER BOOKS of engineering companies in the West Midlands, the traditional
heart of the industry, have stopped shrinking over the past three months
and, for the first time since last May, the proportion of companies
reporting increased demand is higher than those reporting lower demand.
The latest survey of business trends, covering 470 companies, carried out by
the Engineering Employers' Federation West Midlands and published yesterday,
showed that in February 36 per cent of companies experienced an improvement
in the level of domestic orders and 49 per cent an improvement in export
orders.
With 45 per cent of companies expecting total orders to increase over the
next three months, Mr David Botterill, the chief executive of EEF West
Midlands, said there were 'emerging signs of recovery'.
Although 40 per cent of companies are expecting higher utilisation of their
capacity over the next quarter, there is little sign of higher capital
spending and the employment prospects remain bleak.
Only 14 per cent of companies expect to take on more people, although Mr
Botterill expected a slowdown in the rate of job losses.
Such a slowdown has already started. Birmingham City Council recently noted
that although unemployment totals in the city had risen for 31 successive
months, 'the increase has fallen from an average of 17,500 in the year to
January 1992 to 6,000 in the year to January 1993'.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Solicitors to sue Mackay over fees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAW Society, the solicitors' governing body, is to sue Lord Mackay, the
lord chancellor, over his plans to introduce standard fees for criminal
legal aid work in the magistrates' courts.
This is the second time the profession has taken a lord chancellor to court
over legal aid. In 1986 the Bar and the Law Society sought a judicial review
of a refusal by Lord Hailsham, then lord chancellor, to award legal aid
lawyers a 'fair and reasonable' pay rise. The case was settled out of court.
The decision to seek a judicial review of Lord Mackay's standard fee
proposals follows a year-long campaign by solicitors to persuade Lord Mackay
not to replace the current system of paying solicitors on the basis of the
work actually done with a system based on standard fees for different
categories of case.
Lord Mackay intends to introduce the standard fees system from April 1. The
society argues that standard fees will overpay some lawyers and underpay
others. This could result in mistrust between client and solicitor and
reduce the quality of the service available to those who need legal aid.
Mr Mark Sheldon, president of the Law Society, said: 'This case is about
ensuring that proper representation remains available to to those who need
criminal legal aid. This is not a dispute in which we are seeking more pay
for solicitors.'
The society said it hoped its application for judicial review could be dealt
with quickly and it urged Lord Mackay not to make the regulations to
introduce the system until the matter had been resolved.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Walker asks to be made bankrupt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GEORGE Walker, the former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker
charged with the theft of Pounds 12.5m from the company, yesterday asked to
be declared bankrupt in an attempt to secure legal aid to pay for his
defence.
The surprise move came six months after Mr Walker successfully fought off
attempts by creditors to make him bankrupt and instead reached an individual
voluntary arrangement (IVA) with them to repay debts.
In January he was charged with the theft of Pounds 12.5m from the company
following an 18-month Serious Fraud Office investigation of the affairs of
the property and leisure group. The trial is expected to start early next
year and Mr Walker's defence costs are expected to exceed Pounds 1m.
Although Mr Walker's application for legal aid was approved in principle, it
was refused last week because, in spite of the IVA, the Legal Aid Board
deemed he had assets and income available to meet his costs.
Lawyers for Mr Walker yesterday said the decision of the legal aid board
indicated an anomaly between its regulations and the purpose of IVAs, first
legislated for in the 1986 Insolvency Act. The Legal Aid Board was unable to
comment yesterday.
After a 30-minute pri-vate hearing in the High Court yesterday, bankruptcy
registrars postponed their decision on Mr Walker's application until March
22. It is thought almost certain, however, that Mr Walker will then succeed
in being made bankrupt.
TSB Bank, which claimed to be owed nearly Pounds 10m by Mr Walker, tried
last year to have him declared personally bankrupt. The petition failed when
Mr Walker came to the voluntary arrangement with his creditors.
In all, claims against Mr Walker total about Pounds 180m. Creditors with
claims of Pounds 136.5m, more than 75 per cent of the total, voted in favour
of the arrangement under which Mr Walker's assets and most of his income was
pledged to the creditors.
Under the IVA Mr Walker said he would pursue claims against Brent Walker for
wrongful dismissal, and in France against banks which lent to Mr Walker's
family company. These actions might not be pursued if he is declared
bankrupt.
Mr Walker was not in court yesterday as he was believed to be in Russia,
where he is working for his wife's company importing cigarettes and
cosmetics. He is likely to attend the hearing on March 22.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Salvation Army probe discloses arrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRAUD SQUAD detectives with the City and Metropolitan Police made one arrest
last July in connection with the bank behind the alleged Pounds 6.2m fraud
on the Salvation Army, it emerged yesterday.
Senior investigators believe they could have made more arrests had police
been informed earlier about the fraud.
In July police seized documents linking the Islamic Panamerican Bank with an
international network dealing in forged letters of credit and in forged bank
guarantees.
After the arrest and the obtaining of the documents police contacted the FBI
and regulatory authorities in the US. This led to Islamic Pan-american Bank
being identified as a fictitious bank and a second person, Mr Gamil Naguib,
as one of those mainly responsible for it.
Both the Islamic Panamerican Bank and Mr Naguib were named in a writ issued
by the Salvation Army last month to recover its funds. It was only after
this that police were officially asked to investigate the alleged fraud.
It has emerged that although Salvation Army officials may have suspected
fraud as long ago as last August, they did not contact the police then.
One senior investigator, referring to Mr Naguib and others linked to the
Islamic Panamerican Bank, said yesterday: 'If the Salvation Army had told us
then I think we would have caught them with their pants down.'
The importance British police are attaching to the international dimension
of the Salvation Army fraud will be underlined this week when senior
detectives ask the Crown Prosecution Service for approval to travel abroad
in pursuit of fresh informa-tion.
It is understood they want to interview officials in Luxembourg and Belgium
in connection with the transfer between at least two bank accounts last year
of an estimated Dollars 10m of Salvation Army funds.
The sum was initially deposited in an account of ASLK-CGER Bank in Antwerp,
Belgium. The bulk of these funds is believed to have been transferred to
Banque Continentale du Luxembourg subsequently without the knowledge of most
of the charity's senior officers. Police now believe that the bulk of the
funds has been the subject of theft and may never be recoverable unless
further legal action is taken.
The latest development in the Salvation Army case comes amid renewed
indications that the Serious Fraud Office is interested in becoming involved
in the investigation.
The Criminal Justice Act allows the SFO to take over from the fraud squad
cases of serious and complex fraud usually involving more than Pounds 5m.
The Salvation Army had no comment to make last night.

FT  09 MAR 93 / EC law delays prison scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTRACTING out of the management of Strangeways prison in Manchester
has been further delayed by complications arising from EC legislation
designed to protect the rights of workers in takeovers and mergers.
The deadline for submitting bids to run the prison has been put back by four
weeks to April 13 to allow contractors extra time to prepare bids that
comply with the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
regulations 1981.
The Tupe regulations, which implement the EC legislation in the UK, require
the successful bidder to offer the same terms and conditions to prison staff
who transfer to the private sector.
This is the third delay since Home Office lawyers advised in December that
the regulations would apply. It comes as attempts to contract out the prison
service stores to the private sector have collapsed - also because of the
regulations.
The contract to run the stores was won by Beck &amp; Pollitzer, the contract
services group. The company has withdrawn after it emerged that the contract
would be covered by the regulations.
The contract now goes to an in-house team, which put in the second lowest
bid.
The 140 employees - who had been issued with redundancy notices - have been
offered their old jobs back. Beck &amp; Pollitzer is negotiating with the prison
service over providing advice and assistance in implementing the in-house
bid.
The two contracts were put out to tender as part of the government's
market-testing programme, under which private contractors have been given
the opportunity to bid for almost Pounds 1.5bn of government work.
Recent decisions of the European Court of Justice have extended the scope of
the regulations to cover contracting-out of many public ser-vices.
Mr John Sheldon, acting general secretary of the NUCPS civil service union,
said of the prison stores reversal: 'It's about time the government accepted
that the regulations do apply to most market-testing.'

FT  09 MAR 93 / Lloyd's syndicate expects losses to exceed Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most highly rated syndicates at the Lloyd's of London insurance
market yesterday reported that its 1990 loss would exceed Pounds 100m -
about twice the estimate reported by syndicate managers less than five
months ago.
The extent of the problems of syndicate 745 will increase concern among
Names - the individuals whose capital supports underwriting - that Lloyd's
overall deficit for 1990 could reach the 1989 total of Pounds 2bn.
KPH Underwriting Agencies, which manages the syndicate, expects losses to be
between Pounds 108m and Pounds 129m. This compares with the syndicate's
stamp capacity - capital base - of Pounds 43.1m. In October KPH said losses
would be between Pounds 36m and Pounds 60m.
The syndicate's 1,750 Names could lose up to Pounds 30,000 for each Pounds
10,000 share in the syndicate.
Unlike many other syndicates which specialised in catastrophe and 'spiral'
reinsurance - in which syndicates and companies reinsure each other's
high-level catastrophe exposures - 745 was widely respected among
underwriters and brokers. The syndicate attracted 377 so-called 'working
Names', partly because of the reputation of underwriter Mr Dave King who
resigned when news of his own losses emerged last year.
Mr Andrew Elliot, the syndicate's active underwriter, who took over from Mr
King, said recent claims from hurricane Hugo, which hit the Caribbean and
southern US in 1989, and the European storms of January 1990 had been
heavier than expected.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Company failures 'likely to rise'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of companies that failed was stable in the third and fourth
quarters last year, but it is likely to rise again for the first three
months of this year, according to figures released yesterday by Trade
Indemnity, the UK credit insurance group.
There were 1,762 business failures reported in the survey in October to
December last year, compared with 1,760 in the third quarter. That
represented a 6.4 per cent decline in failures over the final quarter of
1991.
But Mr Clive Brand, Trade Indemnity's chief economist, said: 'This does not
show a sustained improvement. Our survey suggests things are pretty flat. We
have to remain cautious.'
He said that historically business failures often declined in the fourth
quarter of the year, so the reduction was not an indication of recovery.
He also warned that there is normally a substantial increase in failures in
the first quarter of the year associated with a lull in business activity
after Christmas.
Trade Indemnity's figures show that 30 per cent of businesses are now
working at half capacity and showing no sign of economic recovery.
It warned that the number of company start-ups virtually matched the number
of businesses failing in the recession. This would create bottle-necks
during any recovery which would increase imports and impede economic growth.

FT  09 MAR 93 / City welcomes net rise in consumer lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER appetite for buying on credit is being rediscovered, according to
statistics reported yesterday by the Central Statistical Office.
The office said yesterday that net lending to consumers by finance houses,
other specialist credit companies, building societies (excluding mortgage
lending), and on bank credit cards under the Visa and Mastercard systems
increased to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 151m in January from a revised
Pounds 105m in December. This was well above expectations.
The monthly net lending, which excludes write-offs for bad debt and is
regarded by the government as the best guide to borrowing trends for
consumer purchases, was the highest since July 1991 and compared with the
City's consensus forecast of a Pounds 50m increase.
The gain in credit granted was welcomed by City economists and the
government. Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist of brokers James Capel, said
the increase marked a 'strengthening of a gentle upwards trend' in the
economy. The Treasury described it as a 'modest pick up' and 'consistent
with other signs of a return of consumer confidence'.
Official figures for the three months to January reinforced the impression
of a steady revival in consumer credit demand. Net lending to consumers of
Pounds 273m in the period compared with a net debt repayment of Pounds 22m
in the three months to October last year.
The latest figures showed that consumers were again using credit cards to
make purchases. Net lending through bank credit cards totalled Pounds 40m in
January after five months in which borrowings had been repaid.
The figures showed a appreciable growth in finance houses' business with net
lending of Pounds 285m in the three months to January against Pounds 92m in
the preceding three months.
The amount of new credit advanced to consumers in January fell, however, to
a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3.93bn from December's relatively high Pounds
4.63bn. The office said that the apparent sharp fall in borrowing may have
reflected problems with seasonal adjustment procedures over the Christmas
trading period in December, when many more shops were open on Sundays.
The government's cyclical indicators, published yesterday, hint at recovery
in the months ahead.
The coincident index, which is meant to track the business cycle, declined
slightly in January to 95.8 from 95.9 in December and has been broadly flat
since September.
Both the CSO's leading indicators advanced. The longer leading index, which
is supposed to pinpoint turning points in the economy about 11 months in
advance, rose 1.3 percentage points to 109.9 and has been rising strongly
since August. The shorter leading index, which indicates turning points
about four months in advance, jumped to 102 from 100.4 and has risen
strongly since October.

FT  09 MAR 93 / 250,000 jobless 'are black or Asian'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 250,000 of Britain's unemployed are black or Asian, according to
figures released yesterday by the GMB, the general union. It said blacks and
Asians are more than twice as likely to be unemployed as white people. One
in four black workers have no job and just under one in every five Asians
are unemployed.
Based on figures from the April 1991 census and updated to take into account
the rise in unemployment over the past 23 months, the survey said the worst
area for Asian unemployment is the east London borough of Tower Hamlets,
with as many as 45 per cent jobless.
Liverpool has the highest proportion of black people without work, amounting
to 38 per cent of the black labour force in the city.
At its first national race conference yesterday, the GMB called on the Home
Office not to go ahead with cutting grant funding to local authorities to
help ethnic minority pro-jects.
Meanwhile, a radical dilution of the definition of 'full employment' to mean
that nobody should be unemployed for more than one year has been suggested
by the influential Employment Policy Institute.
The Institute, usually regarded as left-of-centre, yesterday launched a
'full employment year' designed to foster a wide-ranging national debate on
how to solve mass unemployment.
But Professor Richard Layard, one of Britain's best known experts on
unemployment and a leading member of the institute, stressed that a new
definition of full employment was required concentrating on combat-ing
long-term unemployment.
On present figures that could mean a state of 'full employment' with 2m
people unemployed for periods of up to 12 months. He said: 'Some short-term
unemployment is necessary to control inflation'.
He also stressed the cost of unemployment to those in jobs and estimated
that every tax-payer is now paying an average of Pounds 1,000 a year. Prof
Layard has stressed that the cost of benefit and lost taxes through
unemployment is Pounds 30bn a year. Those out of work for more than one year
alone cost Pounds 8bn.
Many unemployed executives and other professionals will not find
conventional jobs again and should be encouraged to become 'self-employed
portfolio workers' with two or three part-time jobs, according to Full
Employment UK.
The lobby group says that in spite of the recent reductions in
self-employment it remains a vital source of future employment and should be
promoted in next week's Budget through training credits of Pounds 250 to
help portfolio workers get established. Full Employment UK says that 200,000
people could be helped in this way at a cost of Pounds 50m.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Lord McKay accused of 'gross unfairness'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Mackay, the lord chancellor, was accused in the High Court yesterday of
'gross unfairness' in his conduct of competitive tendering for contracts for
shorthand writing services in courts.
Hibbit and Sanders, one of the oldest firms of official shorthand writers,
is challenging Lord Mackay's decision to award another firm the contract for
the Chelmsford group of Crown Courts.
Mr David Pannick QC, for Hibbit and Sanders, said a secret policy was
unfairly adopted of eliminating all tenderers whose bids, over the contract
period, were at least Pounds 250,000 above the lowest price offered by a
firm meeting other stated criteria.
The lord chancellor's department had given some bidders for the group -
including Crown Courts at Cambridge, Ipswich, Luton, Norwich and St Albans -
the chance to reduce their offers, in breach of contract conditions which
allowed clarification of bids but not negotiation.
Mr Pannick said the department had ''irrationally'' failed to give the same
opportunity to Hibbit and Sanders of Wadhurst, East Sussex, even though it
accepted that its bid was rejected only on the grounds of price.
The department had also decided, without telling anyone, to disregard
conditions it had laid down on staffing.
Mr Stephen Richards, for the lord chancellor, said that tendering procedures
had been carried out 'conscientiously and fairly' and Hibbit and Sanders had
suffered no prejudice.
The hearing is expected to last two days.

GPT, which has about 13,000 employees at plants in Coventry, Liverpool, and
Nottingham, confirmed that it had introduced more performance-related pay
but would make no comment on whether it was still involved in collective
bargaining.
The Engineering Training Authority is to establish a formal link with the
Engineering Employers Federation, with EEF members automatically becoming

FT  09 MAR 93 / Equal terms for Tyne employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN two thirds of companies in Tyne and Wear offer harmonised terms
and conditions to all staff and three quarters of employers use a
performance-based reward system, a survey has found, Chris Tighe writes.
The study by the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation notes that more than
60 per cent of the 155 companies surveyed fix employee salaries at a local
level, compared with 38 per cent in similar research in 1991.
The new report records that nearly two thirds of the companies had rising
levels of productivity over the last two years.
Nearly three quarters of the sample are involved in quality training, and
nearly half in team building and information technology training.
The independent research was commissioned from Durham University by the
corporation in partnership with the Confederation of British Industry and
the Trades Union Congress. The 155 companies employ 54,337 people, a fifth
of Tyne and Wear's workforce, excluding retailing and the public sector.

FT  09 MAR 93 / World Trade News: US trade office sees difficult 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 29 PER CENT rise in the US merchandise trade deficit last year is likely
to be followed by a 'potentially difficult' 1993, thanks to the sluggish or
negative growth of America's trading partners and increasing US imports,
according to the Office of the US Trade Representative, now headed by Mr
Mickey Kantor.
The US will meet the difficulty with a policy of market-opening measures
'backed by rigorous enforcement of US laws', says the office's annual report
on US trade priorities. The report follows trade policy addresses by
President Bill Clinton and Mr Kantor, his top trade negotiator, who promised
a more 'activist, less passive' trade policy.
Superficially, there appear to be few changes. Completion of the Uruguay
Round remains the top US priority; but the administration will stress
increased market access through lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers in
manufactured and agricultural goods and services.
The report mentions the need for market access for telecommunications and
audiovisual services, areas which put the US and EC on a collision course.
The administration insists it will act 'firmly to protect our interests
should implementation of the European single market. . .discriminate against
US firms or create barriers to US exports'.
In the coming year the administration plans to boost the importance of the
'new' issues in trade policy - competition policy and technology policy.
'Issues related to the interaction of trade and environment will be given
urgent attention', and lobbyists expect some environmental provision will be
demanded within the Round.

FT  09 MAR 93 / World Trade News: France warned on oilseeds deal - Paris
playing into hands of Americans, Commission claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANCE told its Community partners again yesterday that it could not accept
any world trade reform package containing the oilseeds agreement reached
last November with the US.
But it was warned by the European Commission that it was playing into the
hands of the Americans, who would welcome the chance to win a better deal
for US farmers.
The exchange came as Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, suggested
informally to EC foreign ministers that a Uruguay Round accord should
incorporate 'social parameters' offering an agreed minimum of rights to
workers.
The implication was that Europe was being unfairly undercut by sweatshop
labour in Asia.
Mr Delors was following up remarks he made in a speech in Paris on Friday.
But his spokesman insisted he was expressing well-known views, and not
trying to delay a conclusion to the Round.
Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, reporting earlier to the foreign
ministers on talks in Washington with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, said he believed the US wanted to finish the Round this
year, and did not want new subjects on the agenda.
Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, told his colleagues that France
had been 'totally consistent'. The Commission still had to prove that the
Uruguay Round farm chapter, and the oilseeds deal, were compatible with last
year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.
The Uruguay Round 'final act' - the foundation of attempts to conclude more
than six years of world trade reform talks - was a reasonable basis for
negotiations, Mr Dumas conceded, 'except on agriculture'.
France 'will not accept a global agreement which includes oilseeds in its
present form,' he added.
Mr Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner, insisted last November's
agreement was 'in line with the CAP', and that 'it remains the basis for an
agreement. . . fresh negotiations on agriculture would only please the US'.
The French government, which faces a crushing defeat in parliamentary
elections later this month, threatened to veto the oilseeds agreement if it
were put to a vote yesterday. Both the Commission and the current Danish
presidency of the EC decided not to bring matters to a head, even though Mr
Steichen fears an advantageous deal for the EC could unravel if not quickly
confirmed.
According to Mr Steichen, a vote is now likely when foreign ministers meet
in Luxembourg on April 5.
It is unclear whether the likely new right-wing coalition in France will be
more malleable on the Washington agreement. But senior EC officials do not
rule out the possibility that France will simply be outvoted.
The 'veto' it threatens is based on the so-called Luxembourg compromise, a
1966 political agreement allowing an EC member to invoke 'very important'
national interests to block a deal.
But the device is all but defunct. 'It has never been tested on an external
issue,' one senior diplomat says. It has not been used since the Single
European Act came into force in 1987, and attempts at Luxembourg compromise
'vetoes' by Germany and the UK not long before that both failed.

<TEXT>
BABCOCK Energy, part of the UK's Babcock International Group, has won an
Pounds 80m contract to supply heat-recovery steam generators for the new
2,400MW combined cycle gas turbine plant to be built at Black Point in Hong
Kong.
Babcock was awarded the contract by GEC Alsthom, which leads a consortium
that is building the plant for Hong Kong's Castle Peak Power. Black Point
will be one of the world's largest CCGT power stations.
Heat-recovery steam generators are a crucial element in combined cycle
power, as they use the energy from the hot gas turbine exhaust to generate
steam, which in turn is used to drive steam turbines.
Babcock said its advanced production technology at its Renfrew factory in
Scotland helped it win contracts against international competition.

<TEXT>
France's centre-right opposition, expected to form a government in four
weeks, is proving even more critical of the Gatt negotiations and the US
role in them than the ruling Socialists, whose leader, President Francois
Mitterrand, meets US President Bill Clinton today, David Buchan writes from
Paris.
At a party congress on Sunday, Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR Gaullist leader,
said 'the time has come to defend (European) Community preference' in trade,
both agricultural and industrial. The US has threatened to shut EC companies
out of US federal contract bidding if the EC does not this month scrap a
price preference in its new public procurement law.
Government and opposition have been equally strident in denouncing EC-US
accords on farm exports and oilseed output.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 29 PER CENT rise in the US merchandise trade deficit last year is likely
to be followed by a 'potentially difficult' 1993, thanks to the sluggish or
negative growth of America's trading partners and increasing US imports,
according to the Office of the US Trade Representative, now headed by Mr
Mickey Kantor.
The US will meet the difficulty with a policy of market-opening measures
'backed by rigorous enforcement of US laws', says the office's annual report
on US trade priorities. The report follows trade policy addresses by
President Bill Clinton and Mr Kantor, his top trade negotiator, who promised
a more 'activist, less passive' trade policy.
Superficially there appear to be few changes. Completion of the Uruguay
Round remains the top US priority; but the administration will stress
in-creased market access through lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers in
manufactured and agricultural goods and services.
The report mentions the need for market access for telecommunications and
audio visual services, areas which put the US and EC on a collision course.
The administration insists it will act 'firmly to protect our interests
should implementation of the European single market. . . discriminate
against US firms or create barriers to US exports'.
In the coming year the administration plans to boost the importance of the
'new' issues in trade policy - competition policy and technology policy.
'Issues related to the interaction of trade and environment will be given
urgent attention,' and lobbyists expect some environmental provision will be
demanded within the Round.
The administration remains concerned about the excess supply of steel in the
world and supports efforts to negotiate a Multilateral Steel Agreement and
the establishment of 'an effective mechanism' to resolve disputes. 'Without
the ability to subsidise domestic producers and with the elimination of both
tariff and non-tariff barriers, steel trade would be conducted in a more
efficient manner.'
The trade representative is still consulting Congress about the extension of
the fast-track negotiating authority in order to complete the Uruguay Round,
the report says.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Japanese business confidence tumbles
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE business confidence suffered a further sharp fall between November
and February, raising the prospect of a round of sharp cuts in employment in
the next few months, according to the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of
business conditions, published yesterday.
Manufacturing companies' assessment of business conditions stood at minus 49
per cent, 5 points down from the November survey.
Among non-manufacturers, the index stood at minus 33 per cent, a 6
percentage point fall from the earlier survey. The index measures the
balance of companies reporting conditions as favourable minus those
reporting conditions as unfavourable.
The so-called tankan survey of 688 leading companies is widely regarded as
the most authoritative assessment of the short-term outlook for the Japanese
economy.
The survey suggests that manufacturers will have to cut costs further in the
next few months, while non-manufacturers and small businesses are becoming
increasingly pessimistic.
Despite deep cuts in production, manufacturers have not made much headway in
reducing their inventories of unsold products. About 38 per cent of
manufacturers reported they had excessive inventories, about the same level
as August and November last year.
Demand is expected to remain very weak, with 51 per cent of manufacturers
reporting excess supply of products and 23 per cent reporting excess
production capacity, up by 2 percentage points from November.
Most companies said they expected a moderate rise in domestic and export
sales in the financial year from this April. However, the survey was
conducted before the recent surge in the value of the yen, which is likely
to depress export sales.
About 19 per cent of manufacturers said they had excess labour, up from 13
per cent in November, which suggests there will be further job cuts in the
next few months.
Mr Jim Vestal, Tokyo chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the
stockbroker, said these cuts could further depress the economy: 'Further
cuts in employment will depress consumption as people will save more as a
precautionary measure.'
Companies expect to cut investment by 4.2 per cent next year, with cuts of
9.9 per cent in manufacturing and 4.1 per cent in service industries. Mr
Robert Feldman, Tokyo economist at Salomon Brothers, the stockbrokers, said
the forecast cuts were shallower than had been expected.
Profits may recover marginally in the next financial year, ending a
three-year decline, with manufacturers forecasting a 4.4 per cent rise in
profits and non-manufacturers a 1 per cent improvement.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GUNMEN in South Africa's Natal province yesterday killed four supporters of
the African National Congress. It was the third massacre in less than a week
in an area where the ANC and rival Inkatha Freedom party are fighting for
political power ahead of multiracial elections.
Fears of political violence in the run-up to elections, expected to take
place some time next year, were highlighted yesterday when Mr Justice
Richard Goldstone, chairman of a government commission into public violence,
said the commission would investigate ways of curbing pre-election unrest.
He said a panel of local experts, helped by international expertise, would
investigate issues such as the policing of polling stations, with some
politicians concerned that the South African police could not monitor
polling in an unbiased fashion. The role of international observers would
also be investigated.
Violence has worsened in recent days as popular expectations have focused on
negotiations held last weekend to plan for elections. A local ANC official
claimed that yesterday's attack, which targeted a group of ANC supporters
travelling to a court hearing, was part of 'a planned strategy to destroy
the ANC in the (Natal) midlands in the run-up to elections'.
The attack follows the killing last week of six school children in Natal,
and the massacre of 10 more people last Friday. The murders have sparked
fears of a cycle of revenge attacks in the area, and have heightened
criticism of politicians for failing to make more rapid progress toward a
constitutional settlement.
It has also raised serious concern over whether a free and fair election can
be held in the key Natal province, the regional base of Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi of Inkatha, where territory is bitterly disputed with the ANC.
Yesterday Mr Hernus Kriel, law and order minister, condemned the attack and
blamed local politicians for failing to control their supporters. 'Talk is
not enough. Politicians must now take practical and visible steps. . . peace
will not come by itself.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISLAMIC militants in Egypt yesterday distanced themselves and the man they
consider their spiritual leader - Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman, a New
Jersey-based preacher - from the bombing of the World Trade Centre in New
York, saying attempts to link them were a slur against the sheikh and Islam.
In a statement to news organisations in Cairo the Gama'a al-Islamiyya, or
Islamic Groups, said it did 'not target the innocent' and that Sheikh
Abdul-Rahman had 'no connection' with the February 26 attack.
The message added the warning that 'any defamation touching on Sheikh Omar
Abdul-Rahman will not pass peacefully'.
Mr Mohammed Salameh, the 26-year-old Jordanian national accused of being an
accomplice in the bombing, was said to have prayed at a New Jersey mosque at
which Sheikh Abdul-Rahman preached. But yesterday in New York Mr Salameh's
lawyer also repudiated links between his client and the Egyptian cleric.
The underground Gama'a al-Islamiyya has led recent attacks against foreign
visitors to Egypt, though the group claims to be attacking 'tourism not
tourists'.
Three visitors and one Egyptian have been killed in the attacks.
The same group has warned foreigners to leave Egypt and warned that it might
attack foreign investments in the country.
A Cairo military court will today open the trial of 49 alleged members of
the Gama'a al-Islamiyya accused of leading the attacks.
Maj Gen Mohammed Abdallah, military prosecutor general, said charges would
include intention to kill, possession of arms and explosives and economic
sabotage.
Six of the named defendants, who are among hundreds and perhaps thousands
rounded up by Egypt's security forces since the attacks began last year, are
being charged in absentia. Those found guilty face the death penalty.
Separately, Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, said that Sheikh
Abdul-Rahman would face charges for incitement to violence and terrorism
should he be deported to Egypt from the US. Deportation proceedings against
the sheikh by New Jersey immigration authorities have been deferred.

FT  09 MAR 93 / US warned over drug budget cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration's targeting of the drugs industry could seriously
endanger America's role as a leader in biomedical innovation, according to
Mr Thomas Cueni, secretary general of Interpharma, the Swiss research-based
drug industry association.
The drugs industry had been the main focus for cost-containment, especially
as big multinational research-based groups were very profitable, said Mr
Cueni. The industry suffered from a lack of trust and credibility that was
partly self-inflicted.
'We have not been able to shift the debate from the cost of medicines to the
cost of disease and the value of modern medicines. Instead, we are often
portrayed as selfish, profit-maximising and cashing in on the plight of
people who are sick and need solidarity,' Mr Cueni told a Financial Times
conference.
The industry would have to tackle its image problem to defend its future,
said Professor Ernst-Gunter Afting, head of the pharmaceutical division at
Hoechst AG. Europe's pharmaceutical industry needed annual sales growth of
around 10 per cent if it was to justify present spending on research and
development of Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.54bn) a year.
The industry's defensive responses to reform proposals had added to its
unpopularity, Mr Franz Humer, executive director at Glaxo, claimed. Yet in
the US, 46 per cent of total healthcare spending was on hospital care and
about 8 per cent on drugs. In 1989 the sector spent Pounds 11.9bn worldwide
on discovering and developing drugs. Only three out of every 10 marketed
products generated revenues in excess of their research costs.
Dr Frank Douglas, executive vice-president, research and development at
Marion Merrell Dow, the US group, said the cost of research and development
was rising with some new drugs requiring larger and larger trials - some as
large as 46,000 patients.
Proving medicines' effectiveness in illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease
was difficult and costly, he added. There was also a danger that companies
would be forced to generate data on not only a medicine's safety and
efficacy, but also cost and benefit.
The industry must engage in political marketing, demonstrating that its
marketing strategies are beyond reproach, said Mr Cueni. 'Freebies to
attractive beach or exotic golf resorts should be a thing of the past,' he
said.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Kim steps up fight against corruption
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KIM YOUNG-SAM, the South Korean president, yesterday replaced three of
his newly-appointed ministers for alleged corrupt practices, while he
reshuffled the top military echelon as part of his political reform
programme.
The appointments were the latest in a series of actions Mr Kim, a former
opposition leader, has taken in his first 10 days in office to fight
corruption and remove the last vestiges of the country's authoritarian past.
Mr Kim, who had promised to install a clean government, ousted three of his
ministers and the new mayor of Seoul, a presidential appointee, for alleged
unethical activities, such as illegal land transactions, after they were
exposed by the media.
The cabinet members who were appointed yesterday included Mr Kim Doo-hee,
the prosecutor general, as justice minister, Ms Song Jeong-sook, a newspaper
editorial writer, as minister of health and social affairs, and Mr Koh
Byung-woo, chairman of the Korea Stock Exchange, as construction minister.
A presidential spokesman claimed that conservative opponents of Mr Kim had
leaked details of the alleged wrongdoing by the ousted cabinet ministers in
an attempt to embarrass the new administration and stop the president's
reform programme.
Mr Kim has angered officials linked to the former military dictatorship and
the previous administration of President Roh Tae-woo by appointing political
reformers to the cabinet and senior positions within the ruling Democratic
Liberal party (DLP), while purging hardliners from the military and the
national security agency.
Yesterday's shake-up of the military included the replacement of Gen Kim
Jin-young as the army chief of staff and Lt Gen Suh Wan-soo as the head of
the defence security command, the top military intelligence agency.
The two army generals were said to be closely affiliated with Mr Chun
Doo-hwan, who staged a military coup in 1979 and ruled as president until
1987.
The new president last week ordered the dismissal of 200 officials from the
national security planning agency in a bid to curb the power of the agency,
which played a prominent role in suppressing domestic dissent during the
military dictatorship.
Mr Kim has surprised Koreans by the aggressiveness he has shown in imposing
his authority on the government and appointing his own followers to key
positions despite his weak position within the DLP, which he only joined in
1990 after three decades in opposition.
The new president has won wide public support for his reform programme,
enjoying an approval rating of 70 per cent.
His popularity has been boosted by such symbolic acts as removing security
barriers around the presidential Blue House and National Assembly.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Iran may soon have N-weapon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAN COULD have a nuclear weapon by the end of the decade, according to Mr
Robert Gates, until recently director of the US Central Intelligence Agency.
He said this was probably 'a reasonable estimate' if Iran did not receive
fissile materials from abroad. If it did, it could complete a nuclear arms
programme earlier, he told a BBC Panorama programme due to be broadcast last
night.
The US intelligence community has been divided about the state of advance of
Iran's nuclear programme. Panorama cited unconfirmed intelligence reports
that beryllium, used as a component of nuclear weapons, and uranium pellets
for a nuclear reactor had been shipped to Iran from Kazakhstan.
Mr Reza Amrollahi, president of the Iranian Atomic Energy organisation,
strongly denied that Iran's nuclear programme, including its recent reactor
deal with China, was for anything but peaceful purposes.
Mr Gates also told the programme there was evidence of an Iranian chemical
weapons programme, including choking, blister and blood agents. Estimates of
its stockpile ranged from a few hundred tonnes to 2,000 tonnes.
Iran was among signatories of a treaty banning chemical weapons in January.

MILLIONS of workers in third world countries are subject to forced labour
and governments are not doing enough to stamp it out and punish offenders,
the International Labour Organisation said yesterday.
The ILO's annual World Labour Report highlights cases of traditional slavery
in Africa, debt bondage in Asia, forms of 'white slavery' in Latin America
and sale of children to sweatshops and brothels.
Traditional slavery persists in Mauritania and in Sudan, where it appears to
be on the increase because of the nine-year civil war, the report says.
Unofficial militia groups in Sudan, allegedly aided by the government, have
raided villages of the Dinka tribe, looting property and taking slaves.
Sudanese peasants are also selling their children, mostly boys aged 7-12 who
fetch about Dollars 70 (Pounds 49), the ILO says.
The report says 20m workers, including 7.5m children, may be bonded
labourers in Pakistan, in the brick-kiln industry, fish-cleaning,
shoe-making, agriculture and quarrying.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Afghans wrangle as peace accord is signed: The prospects for
a lasting settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFGHANISTAN'S rival mujahideen leaders flew to Saudi Arabia yesterday to
offer prayers at Mecca after signing a peace accord in Pakistan over the
week-end.
But western diplomats said the agreement provides no guarantees that
Afghanistan can finally overcome the bloody rivalries which have plagued it
during 14 years of civil war.
Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the guerrilla leader whose troops have killed at
least 1,000 people and injured another 6,000 in rocket attacks on Kabul this
year, was appointed prime minister.
Western diplomats were concerned about the precedent set for other guerrilla
leaders by the appointment of Mr Hekmatyar. 'If you fight and kill, you win,
is the basic message here. I fear the day when others will try to follow
that,' said one.
President Burhanuddin Rabbani remains head of state until the middle of 1994
under the agreement.
But the two men were wrangling until the last minute over the assignment of
ministerial positions. Mr Hekmatyar insisted on the exclusion of the defence
minister, Mr Ahmad Shah Masood, from the cabinet on the grounds that both
the president and the defence minister should not come from the same party,
because this would tilt the balance in favour of one group. Mr Rabbani
forcefully resisted.
Under the accord, the cabinet is to be decided within two weeks in
consultations between the president and prime minister, and all parties will
be represented on a defence council. But Mr Hekmatyar said within minutes of
the signing: 'It is my prerogative as prime minister to choose the defence
minister.'
The two-week delay was an attempt to buy time in the hope of an agreement
being reached later, one senior official said. 'It was also a face-saving
solution for Pakistan which would have been embarrassed if the talks had
collapsed.'
The agreement includes a provision to set up a military commission which
would take over heavy arms from different groups and create a national army.
The Afghan leaders agreed to seek help from the Saudi Arabia-based
Organisation of Islamic Conference in monitoring the ceasefire.
General Rashid Dostum, the powerful Uzbek whose troops control large parts
of northern Afghanistan, is excluded from the agreement, providing another
reason for concern. 'He will only become more of a threat to Kabul if he is
joined by Masood in the event that Hekmatyar succeeds in removing him,' said
one senior diplomat.
Residents of Kabul yesterday welcomed the truce, although three people were
killed and 25 injured as government troops exchanged rocket and artillery
fire with the minority Hezb-i-Wahdat party, which had ratified the
agreement.
There are no plans yet to resume United Nations aid operations after the
withdrawal of UN inter-national staff in January when three workers and an
international consultant were killed by gunmen near the eastern city of
Jalalabad.
A UN appeal for Dollars 138m (Pounds 97m) in humanitarian assistance,
launched early this year, has so far only received commitments of Dollars
5m-Dollars 6m. Mr Sotorios Mousouris, the UN secretary-general's personal
representative on Afghanistan, said in an interview yesterday: 'We have not
received encouraging pledges from too many governments yet. That is
something that has worried me for some time now.'
Mr Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's prime minister, described the weekend agreement
as an important breakthrough and said: 'We pray that, as a result of this
agreement, there will now be harmony, peace and understanding.' But
Pakistani officials said it was now up to the Afghans to honour the
agreement. One said: 'You can take a horse to the water tank but can you
make it drink?'

FT  09 MAR 93 / Fed reopens inquiry into BNL loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve has reopened a formal investigation into the scandal
over Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) of illegal Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta,
Georgia, branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), according to US
officials and a senior executive of BNL.
The US central bank, concerned about repeated allegations that Rome
officials were involved in the Atlanta loans that helped build President
Saddam Hussein's war machine, issued a formal subpoena to BNL in December.
That subpoena demanded a series of documents relevant to the bank's dealings
with Iraq.
Investigators from the Fed have been in the Italian capital during the past
few weeks, questioning BNL officials.
The new investigation was described by one US government official as an
attempt 'to finally get to the bottom of the story and find out the degree
to which Rome may have been involved in the Iraqi loans'.
The Fed's renewed interest in the BNL case was spurred in part by
revelations last autumn that the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had
withheld confidential reports that alleged involvement by BNL in Rome in the
Atlanta loans to Iraq. The bank has denied any involvement in the Atlanta
loans.
Disclosure of the CIA reports came during a court hearing in Atlanta in
which the US Justice Department during the Bush administration argued that
the Dollars 5bn of Iraqi loans had been organised by Mr Christopher Drogoul,
the former BNL Atlanta manager. Mr Drogoul argued instead that executives in
Rome knew about and approved the clandestine loans. His trial has been
postponed until next autumn.
The reopened Federal Reserve investigation was also triggered by the fact
that last December BNL sacked a small number of mid-level executives who
worked on the Iraqi loans matter in Rome.
Mr Gianmaria Sartoretti, one of the BNL executives to have lost his job, is
said by US officials to be considering filing unfair dismissal charges
against the bank.
In Rome, a new Italian Senate commission investigating the BNL loans scandal
is expected to begin its deliberations today.
Mr Davide Croff, a senior BNL executive, said the bank had received the
subpoena and was co-operating with officials from the US.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SENATE judiciary committee today begins hearings on the nomination of Ms
Janet Reno, a state prosecutor from Miami, to be the next attorney general
of the US.
Ms Reno, 54, was chosen by President Bill Clinton after Ms Zoe Baird
withdrew her nomination following revelations she had hired illegal
immigrants as household help. Later, Judge Kimba Wood also took herself out
of consideration for related 'nannygate' reasons.
No serious opposition to Ms Reno has yet surfaced, although some right-wing
lobbies, including the National Rifle Association, have circulated rumours,
denied by the White House and several prominent senators, that she had been
stopped by the police on suspicion of driving under the influence of
alcohol. The NRA is exercised because she is known to be a staunch advocate
of tougher gun controls.
Another conservative group, the Free Congress Foundation, yesterday issued
an indictment of Ms Reno's qualifications, pointing to her lack of federal
law enforcement experience and objecting to her record as a social activist
who commands the support of leading US feminist organisations.
Ms Reno can also expect to be questioned on her position on the death
penalty. She said when nominated that she was personally opposed to capital
punishment but had sought it as a state prosecutor in certain cases
according to the dictates of Florida law.
Assuming her confirmation as the first ever woman attorney general, the
stage will then finally be set for the appointments of a new upper echelon
to the justice department, still under the acting management of Mr Stuart
Gerson, a Bush administration official.
Of particular importance will be the nominations of a deputy to Ms Reno and
of a solicitor general, who argues government cases before the Supreme
Court.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOSEPH STIGLITZ, one of the most respected theoretical economists in the
US, is to become the third member of President Bill Clinton's Council of
Economic Advisers.
A professor at Stanford University, Mr Stiglitz, who is 50, has held chairs
at Yale, Oxford and Princeton universities and is an acknowledged master of
the highly abstract mathematical theories that have dominated academic
economics since the second world war.
On the council he is expected to concentrate on microeconomic issues, such
as the regulation of industry and financial markets. His experience will
neatly complement that of his colleagues. Ms Laura Tyson, the chairwoman,
has specialised in trade policy and the economics of high-tech industries.
Mr Alan Blinder, from Princeton University, is a noted macroeconomist, who
will concentrate on topics such as monetary policy and economic forecasting.
Mr Stiglitz's appointment is a hat trick for the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. All three panel members earned doctorates in its economics
department, headed for many years by two of America's leading Keynesian
economists, Nobel laureates Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow. The hallmark of
much MIT research is a sophisticated scepticism about the efficiency of free
markets; much of Mr Stiglitz's work, for example, has focused on markets'
imperfections and limitations.
While leaning to the political left, Mr Clinton's panel has an impressive a
range of expertise and skills. Ms Tyson, while not of Mr Stiglitz's calibre
as a theoretical economist, is proving an adroit advocate of Mr Clinton's
policies on Capitol Hill and on TV talk shows. The council, however, will
have to compete for influence with the new National Economic Council, headed
by Mr Robert Rubin, a former co-chairman of investment bank Goldman Sachs.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Architect of austerity ahead in Bolivian poll: But Sanchez
will not be counting on victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENTIAL campaigning is hotting up ahead of a June election in Bolivia,
as the four-year term of President Jaime Paz Zamora draws to its close.
Surprisingly, since popular support for economic reform is supposed to be
eroding, opinion polls show one of the main architects of economic austerity
in the 1980s significantly ahead of his four main rivals.
Mr Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the candidate of the National Revolutionary
Movement (MNR), was a key minister in the government of President Vctor Paz
Estenssoro which in 1985 embarked on one of Latin America's first and most
radical economic stabilisation programmes.
This brought inflation down from 23,000 per cent in 1985 to 11 per cent last
year, one of the lowest rates in Latin America. It also helped to restore
economic growth, to 2-4 per cent a year between 1987 and 1992.
This expansion has not, however, lessened extreme poverty - a United Nations
report says Bolivia has the highest proportion of rural poor in the world -
while income distribution appears to have become even more unequal during
the 1980s.
Exports are falling and the trade deficit widening. Foreign debt, which
dropped by Dollars 1.1bn between 1987 and 1991, is again rising, by more
than Dollars 300m in 1992 to Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.6bn).
Mr Paz Zamora's ruling coalition, an unlikely alliance between two parties
of the political left and right, is widely criticised for failing to
capitalise on the legacy of the previous administration's economic changes.
According to successive US State Department reports, the government has been
plagued by widespread corruption and weakness in policy implementation.
The present government has botched its infant privatisation programme and
been forced to suspend joint venture deals designed to attract foreign
investment to state mining corporation Comibol.
Mr Sanchez says: 'The biggest sin of this government has been lost time. In
1989, the majority of Bolivians supported a market economy. Today, most are
against it.'
While this might be expected to hinder him, the MNR leader appears to have
improved his chances with the appointment of a well-respected indigenous
leader, Mr Victor Hugo Cardenas, as vice-president.
This is in part a response to the growing challenge of newly-formed populist
opposition parties, led by ambitious individuals excluded from the ruling
class because of their origins or skin colour. Local elections and opinion
polls show they have struck a chord with the electorate.
Two candidates, Mr Antonio Aranibar, leader of the opposition centre-left
MBL party, and Mr Carlos Palenque of the more populist Condepa, say they
seek to include indigenous voices in national politics.
Another populist is Mr Max Fernandez of the UCS party, a beer magnate. His
campaign has already brought insinuations about the source of finance for
his extensive campaign and links, strongly denied, to the drugs trade.
But Mr Sanchez's chief rival could be General Hugo Banzer Suarez of the
National Democratic Action (ADN), military dictator from 1971 to 1978. He
has alarmed the business community by choosing a former Communist party
leader as a running mate.
Even though, according to most opinion polls, he seems to be ahead, Mr
Sanchez is unlikely to be counting on victory. Opinion polls in this
predominantly rural country are unreliable and Bolivia's singular electoral
system usually means the choice of president is made in August by the lower
house of Congress.
This has advantages in that Bolivia's presidents generally are able to
govern with a majority in the lower house. But it also means that the most
popular candidate in the election often does not end up as president, unless
he wins more than half of the votes. Mr Sanchez knows this to his cost: he
polled most votes in the 1989 election but lost because Gen Banzer threw his
party's weight behind Mr Paz Zamora.

THE US Federal Reserve has reopened a formal investigation into the scandal
over Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) of illegal Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta,
Georgia, branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), according to US
officials involved in the case and to a senior executive of BNL.
The US central bank, concerned about repeated allegations that Rome

Mr Giampiero Cantoni, chairman of BNL, may be among those to testify in the
next few days.
Mr Davide Croff, a senior BNL executive, last night confirmed that the Fed
had reopened its investigation and said that the bank had received the
subpoena and was co-operating with officials from the US.
The sackings, said Mr Croff, were based on a series of what he described as
'administrative irregularities' related to the Atlanta loans. However, he
said the bank was not accusing the dismissed bankers of involvement in the
Iraqi loans.

<TEXT>
THE IMF has approved a Dollars 655m (Pounds 461m) stand-by credit to Poland
partly aimed at reducing the country's Dollars 46bn debt, George Graham
reports from Washington. The Fund suspended an earlier arrangement with
Poland in 1991 as the country failed to meet targets for curbing inflation
and cutting the budget deficit.
The Polish parliament last month approved a tight budget aimed at lopping
the deficit to 81,000bn zlotys (Pounds 3.4bn) or 5 per cent of GDP, opening
the way for the IMF to give its approval to a new economic plan. The IMF
said yesterday the Polish authorities had asked for a quarter of each
disbursement from the stand-by credit to be set aside for debt reduction,
and said it would be prepared to increase the credit if a debt reduction
agreement could be reached with commercial bank creditors.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Poles find trade figures add up to a debt puzzle

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONTROVERSY over the real state of Poland's trade has underlined the
problems of making economic decisions on the basis of doubtful and often
contradictory statistics.
Questions were raised last week when the Foreign Trade Ministry issued
figures, based on customs data, which pointed to a Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds
1.7bn) deficit last year. These contradicted earlier figures, collated by
the National Bank and seized on by the government as proof of Poland's
strong economic performance, which showed a surplus of Dollars 512m.
The trade ministry's figures, published by the central statistical office,
valued exports at Dollars 12.9bn, or Dollars 1.1bn less than the central
bank. Imports at Dollars 15.5bn were Dollars 2bn lower than the National
Bank stated.
The two sets of figures are always slightly different, as the central bank
charts actual trade payments worth over Dollars 10,000 made through 38
banks, while the statistical office reports on physical movement of goods
across frontiers, paid in cash or on credit.
But the discrepancy this time is so large as to raise doubts about Poland's
capacity to run a trade surplus large enough to meet its foreign debt
service obligations, which rise sharply from 1994.
This week Mr Andrzej Topinski, a former deputy head of the central bank,
sought to limit the damage by arguing that the trade ministry's figures
reflected problems with managing a new customs form rather than actual
trade.
To complicate matters further, statistics from the OECD countries, which now
account for nearly two thirds of Poland's foreign trade, show a Dollars 1bn
deficit in the first eight months of last year.
Figures for trade with the European Community show a Dollars 600m Polish
deficit with the Twelve for the first nine months.

MR Giuliano Amato, Italy's prime minister, yesterday called on the country's
younger generation, made cynical by growing revelations of political
corruption, to go into public service.
Complaining of traditional weaknesses in Italy's public administration,
which were reflected in its position in international bodies, he called on
the young to take up a civil service career for moral, rather than just
economic, grounds.
'We are always under-represented compared with our financial contribution in
leading international organisations such as the European Commission and the
World Bank,' he said. 'Before creating a European ruling class, we need to
create a national ruling class.'
His remarks, in a lecture at Milan's prestigious Bocconi University on the
political responsibility of the class running the economy, came a day after
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro refused to sign a government decree Mr Amato
had submitted to minimise the legal consequences for those accused of
illegal political funding.
Mr Amato's visit to Milan was his first to the city, which has spearheaded
the country's growing investigations into political corruption, since he
became prime minister last June.
Seated in the front row was Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, Milan's chief
public prosecutor who has headed the corruption investigations in the city.
A statement opposing Mr Amato's decree on political funding, given in the
name of Milan magistrates and read by Mr Borrelli to television cameras on
Sunday, undoubtedly contributed to President Scalfaro's decision not to sign
the decree.
The audience included representatives from the top echelon of Italian
business and finance, including a number of businessmen whose companies or
families have become enmeshed in the corruption investigation.
Among those present were Mr Giovanni Agnelli and Mr Cesare Romiti, chairman
and chief executive of Fiat, and Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, managing
director of Pirelli, one of whose brothers was recently arrested by the
Milan magistrates.
Mr Amato, who was alternately heckled and cheered by students in the packed
lecture hall, notably avoided any mention of the current investigations.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Verdict put off on Ilva state aid
</HEADLINE>

THE European Commission has postponed indefinitely a decision on whether to
outlaw state aid to Ilva, Italy's loss-making steel company.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, wanted Rome to recover
L350bn (Pounds 160m) paid to Ilva in 1991 in the form of a capital increase,
and freeze a planned second tranche of L300bn.
But senior Brussels aides agreed yesterday that the proposal should not be
discussed at today's full European Commission meeting in Strasbourg.
Mr Van Miert has withdrawn the proposal because the Italian authorities have
promised to submit a new restructuring plan for Ilva by the end of April.
But he was also under pressure from his colleagues to consider controversial
Italian and Spanish state aid plans as part of the EC's overall proposals to
support the west European steel industry.
Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the Italian industry minister, threatened 10 days ago
to block the overall EC plan if the L650bn recapitalisation was not approved
by Brussels, and Madrid has also warned that it will protect its domestic
industry if necessary.
Mr Van Miert yesterday met Mr Claudio Aranzadi, the Spanish industry
minister, to discuss Madrid's proposals to subsidise the Spanish industry in
exchange for capacity cuts. The Commission has already indicated that aid
will have to be reduced or more capacity cut. Mr Aranzadi is now said to be
suggesting that the cost of building a new steel mill in the volatile Basque
region of Spain could be borne by private investors. Mr Van Miert's
spokesman refused to comment yesterday on the outcome of the discussions,
but confirmed there would have to be other meetings between the two men.
EC ministers backed an outline Commission plan to give commercial and
financial support to the west European steel industry in exchange for
restructuring at a meeting two weeks ago.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Poll pressure grows on French Socialists: Fortysomethings of
France's left-wing elite fight for political life after the election

<TEXT>
A GROUP of younger leaders in France's governing Socialist party will
tomorrow call for their party to put itself at the centre of a new social
democratic coalition.
The move by the so-called 'quadras' (for quadragenarians or 40-year-olds) is
clearly prompted by last month's call by Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist
standard-bearer in the next presidential poll, for a 'big bang' to recompose
centre-left forces in France. But the 'quadras' are also closely linked to
Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, who has long been
urging his Socialist party to modernise itself.
Another sign that the Socialists, who are facing near-certain defeat in the
election's two rounds of voting on March 21 and 28, are opening up under
pressure came yesterday from Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
The industry minister, who is hard pressed in his campaign to keep his
industrial constituency seat outside Paris, said that Socialist candidates
who do worse than their ecologist competitors in the first round of voting
should urge their supporters to vote 'green' in the second round.
'In their vast majority, ecologists are basically progressive,' Mr
Strauss-Kahn said, 'and it is necessary to block the return of the right.'
The industry minister does not himself face a very strong green challenge,
but others, including Mr Rocard, do.
In earlier stages of the campaign, the country's environmentalist parties
were outpolling the Socialists, and they remain the prime target of
Socialist wooing.
By contrast, the RPR Gaullists and the centre-right UDF party have a formal
electoral pact, under which they are fielding a single candidate in all but
around 80 of the 577 constituencies. But there is already tension over
cabinet jobs in a future government.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Bosnian push 'to prevent a massacre'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S army commander, General Sefir Halilovic, yesterday ordered his
forces to launch a counter-offensive against Bosnian Serb troops in the east
of the country, 'to prevent the massacre of innocent people' in besieged
Moslem enclaves.
The lives of thousands of women, children, old, wounded and exhausted people
were at risk in the region, following a 10-day assault by the Bosnian Serb
army, Gen Halilovic told Sarajevo radio.
Moslem leaders fear that the besieged Moslem enclaves of Srebrenica and
Konjevic Polje in the eastern Bosnian highlands are under imminent threat
from Serbian forces, following their occupation of nearby Cerska last week.
However, despite the fighting, General Philippe Morillon, the commander of
United Nations forces in Bosnia, said after talks with Serb leaders in their
administrative headquarters of Pale, near Sarajevo, that the Serbs had
agreed to the evacuation of Moslems from the two enclaves this week.
They would allow a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
convoy to go to Konjevic Polje today and the trucks could probably return to
Srebrenica on Thursday.
But officials warned that such deals had often broken down in the past when
it came to implementing them. A UNHCR official and a World Health
Organisation doctor, who went to Srebrenica last weekend, said some 2,000
people were ill and were dying at the rate of 30 each day.
Thousands of people wanted to be evacuated from the area, they said.
The announcement of the Moslem offensive marked the end of a unilateral
ceasefire declared several weeks ago by government forces.
At the same time, Gen Halilovic withdrew from talks in Sarajevo with General
Ratko Mladic, the Serb military commander, and Gen Morillon on a truce in
eastern Bosnia.
President Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem Bosnian president, defended the
counter-offensive by stressing that 'any measure to protect these people
from slaughter is a legitimate measure'.
Gen Halilovic said that all available Moslem military units in the region
had been ordered to take part in the attack against Vlasenica, which
commands a vital road link for Serbs between their administrative
headquarters at Pale and Serb-occupied territory in northern Bosnia.
Though Serb army headquarters confirmed heavy fighting was taking place in
several areas of eastern Bosnia, it claimed that Moslem units had been
repulsed and had suffered heavy losses.

GERMANY'S Federal Labour Office yesterday called on local authorities to
apply existing rules more strictly when granting work permits to foreigners
to ensure jobs are not taken away from German nationals and residents in the
country.
A decree sent to state labour offices said the authorities must prove to
their satisfaction that no German nationals or residents are available to
fill the jobs before granting work permits to foreigners.
The decision came as unemployment figures for February showed that 3.5m
people were now out of work, bringing the jobless rate to 7.5 per cent in
the west and 14.5 per cent in the east. At the same time, however, the
number of visas given to non-EC nationals climbed by 50 per cent to 1.35m.
'Such a development is no longer acceptable in light of the steady worsening
of the labour market,' Mr Norbert Blum, labour minister, said.

FT  09 MAR 93 / SPD sees Hesse result as warning to main parties
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Germany's democratic system is threatened by voters'
disaffection with the two main political parties, Mr Bjorn Engholm, the
leader of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), warned yesterday.
A slide in the fortunes of both the SPD and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's rival
Christian Democrats (CDU) in local elections in the state of Hesse at the
weekend indicated a 'deep crisis of confidence' in the parties which have
dominated Germany's post-war political system, Mr Engholm said.
The poll saw the lowest turnout in Hesse since 1948, with a vote of 71.3 per
cent, and a drain of support from the main political parties to the left and
right. The extreme right-wing Republicans picked up 8.4 per cent of the
vote, and the left-wing environmentalist Greens took 11 per cent.
Mr Kohl, however, dismissed the vote for the Republicans and two other
neo-Nazi splinter groups as a temporary phenomenon. He blamed the protest
voting on the 'extremely difficult situation' in the German economy and on
political divisions following the country's unification.
The chancellor called for all political parties to speed up the
decision-making process in Bonn. He also urged the SPD to agree this week on
a comprehensive 'solidarity pact' to finance the rising costs of
unification. The two sides meet for further talks on Thursday and Friday.
Mr Kohl's CDU polled 32 per cent in the Hesse elections, down 2.3 percentage
points on its result in the last local elections in 1989, and 8 points down
on the Hesse state election result in 1991.
However, the biggest loser was the SPD, which is the majority party in the
Hesse government, in coalition with the Greens.
The party saw its support fall from 44.8 per cent to 36.4 per cent compared
with 1989, with particularly bad results in big urban areas such as
Frankfurt, Wiesbaden and Kassel.
The swing to the Republicans was smaller than many commentators had feared.
The party gained almost 11 per cent of the vote in last year's state
election in neighbouring Baden-Wurttemberg, campaigning against
immi-gration.
However, Mr Engholm warned at growing insecurity in the German population,
with rising unemployment and threats of further public spending cuts. He
said that there was a clear shift to the right in voting patterns, with the
Republicans picking up support among 'the weakest levels in our society'.
'It is not the first time we have seen this,' he said. 'There is a great
danger of people who are suffering in our society turning to those who
promise them the most.'

FT  09 MAR 93 / Serbs to face UN pressure on peace plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE international peace plan for Bosnia-Hercegovina will be submitted to the
United Nations Security Council for endorsement if Bosnia's Moslem President
Alija Izetbegovic signs up to it - even if Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian
Serb leader, holds out against the plan.
Such a move, discussed by EC foreign ministers in Brussels after a briefing
from Lord Owen, co-chairman of the UN-mandated peace negotiations, could
lead to pressure on the Serbs to implement the plan, according to EC
ministers and officials. It forms part of renewed efforts to bring greater
pressure on Serbia and Bosnian Serbs to agree peace terms. 'You can't apply
serious pressure in a vacuum,' Lord Owen said.
He judged that 'the most likely next signature is of President Izetbegovic,'
adding: 'I don't think Karadzic will sign without a lot of pressure.'
Moslems, Serbs and Croats in Bosnia have all accepted constitutional
principles and defence agreements in the plan, but only the Croats have
agreed on a map setting up 10 semi-autonomous areas.
'If we're only held up by Mr Karadzic's signature on the map, it is
perfectly justifiable to take that package to the UN Security Council,' Lord
Owen said. He got full backing from the 12 for this stance.
Lord Owen said he and his co-mediator, Mr Cyrus Vance, had ruled out any
further changes in the map dividing Bosnia. He believed he could persuade
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia that 'it is a fair settlement'. Mr
Karadzic had previously accepted the rest of the plan under pressure from
Belgrade.
Lord Owen went out of his way to be conciliatory, as well as firm. 'We don't
want the Serbs to become pariahs,' he said. 'They are a proud and great
nation who have the right to live in Europe,' but had to conform to its
rules.
Senior officials said that implicit in yesterday's discussions was the
possibility of force being used to impose parts of the plan. But the US,
Britain and France yesterday rejected suggestions that UN member states
should be prepared to use force to implement a peace plan, even if the
Bosnian Serbs did not endorse the settlement.
In Washington, Mr George Stephanopoulos, the White House spokesman, said the
US would consider using troops only to enforce a negotiated agreement to
which all warring parties had subscribed.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said a 'good deal of planning had
still to be done' on implementation, but 'no government is talking of
fighting your way to a settlement'.

GREECE'S central bank yesterday lifted the last remaining restriction on
interest rates by abolishing its 18 per cent minimum rate for deposit
accounts, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
The move would contribute to a gradual decline in interest rates, both on
government paper and for commercial borrowing. Banks are expected to trim
operating costs by sharply reducing interest rates for small
account-holders, who will be encouraged to shift their savings to the post
office and other institutions. The central bank is under government pressure
to speed deregulation to compete effectively in the single market. However,
real interest rates are expected to remain high.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Poles find trade figures add up to a debt puzzle
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CONTROVERSY over the real state of Poland's trade has underlined the
problems of making economic decisions on the basis of doubtful and often
contradictory statistics.
Questions were raised last week when the Foreign Trade Ministry issued
figures, based on customs data, which pointed to a Dollars 2.5bn deficit
last year. These contradicted earlier figures, collated by the National Bank
and seized on by the government as proof of Poland's strong economic
performance, which showed a surplus of Dollars 512m.
The Trade Ministry's figures, published by the Central Statistical Office,
valued exports at Dollars 12.9bn, or Dollars 1.1bn less than the central
bank. Imports at Dollars 15.5bn were Dollars 2bn lower than the National
Bank stated.
The two sets of figures are always slightly different, as the central bank
charts actual trade payments worth over Dollars 10,000 made through 38
banks, while the statistical office reports on physical movement of goods
across frontiers, paid in cash or on credit.
But the discrepancy this time is so large as to raise doubts about Poland's
capacity to run a trade surplus large enough to meet its foreign debt
service obligations, which rise sharply from 1994.
This week Mr Andrzej Topinski, a former deputy head of the central bank,
sought to limit the damage by arguing that the Trade Ministry's figures
reflected problems with managing a new customs form rather than actual
trade.
To complicate matters further, statistics from the OECD countries, which now
account for nearly two thirds of Poland's foreign trade, show a Dollars 1bn
deficit in the first eight months of last year, while European Community
figures for the first nine months show a Dollars 600m Polish deficit with
the EC.
Both the central bank and the statistical office agree that the deficit
deepened in the last months of the year. The central bank figures, for
example, showed a Dollars 507m deficit in the last quarter alone, as
businessmen rushed to avoid a 6 per cent import surcharge introduced in
mid-December.
Some of these deliveries were probably arranged on short-term credit, which
should further depress the payments figures for the first quarter of this
year.
The introduction of a new customs form in January 1992 has created havoc
among statisticians and traders alike, so that preliminary figures for the
whole year have only now become available.
But, in contrast to previously collated trade figures, which were based on
returns made by state sector traders and merely estimated private sector
trade, the new forms have thrown fresh light on the private sector, and
especially the former 'grey' area of semi-clandestine trading.

GERMANY'S Federal Labour Office yesterday called on local authorities to

to ensure jobs are not taken away from German nationals and residents in the

A decree sent to state labour offices said the authorities must prove to
their satisfaction that no German nationals or residents are available to

'Such a development is no longer acceptable in light of the steady worsening
of the labour market,' Mr Norbert Blum, the federal labour minister, said.
The decree said work permits should not be extended for more than a year, to
allow for an annual re-examination of domestic labour market conditions.
While the majority of working permits expire after a year, some are issued
for up to three years.
In addition, local labour offices must contact job applicants in regions
with higher unemployment rates before permits for seasonal work are granted
to foreigners.
The rising number of asylum applicants has contributed to the sharp increase
in permits granted to foreigners, federal officials admitted. For the past
two years, asylum seekers have been allowed to seek work while waiting for
their case to be processed.
Other work permits have been given to foreign workers hired by enterprises
operating in Germany. Many of these come from eastern Europe.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Amato misreads public mood of hostility: The prime minister
has made his first error in handling the corruption scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE subtle touch has for once deserted Mr Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime
minister, and his credibility has been badly damaged by his handling of the
corruption scandal.
In pressing for a political solution to the complex problems presented by
Italy's growing list of political and commercial corruption cases, he
misread public opinion, underestimated the opposition of the judiciary, and
miscalculated the hostility of parliament.
As a result President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has refused to sign the most
sensitive item of legislation - a decree depenalising the illicit funding of
political parties. The president's action has defused a growing wave of
protest over what was seen as an unacceptable attempt to provide an easy way
out for businessmen and politicians involved in bribery and the illicit
funding of political parties. But it has left the 54-year-old Socialist
prime minister looking extremely vulnerable and at odds with a key
institutional figure who until now has been his staunchest ally.
Mr Amato has also lost a useful cabinet ally, Mr Carlo Ripa de Meana, the
environment minister. Mr Ripa de Meana, who last month resigned from the
Socialist party because of its involvement in corruption, confirmed
yesterday he had tendered his resignation over Mr Amato's handling of the
anti-corruption legislation.
How then did Mr Amato and his four-party coalition end up in this mess? When
the government announced its intention 10 days ago to find a 'political'
solution to the problems being created by the corruption scandals there was
little protest and much support. The arguments were strong for such an
approach.
After a year more than a 1,000 senior politicians, businessmen and officials
are now under investigation for corruption, and this is considered the tip
of the iceberg. The practice of businessmen paying bribes to parties to
secure contracts and privileged market positions is now known to have been
the norm in almost every aspect of life, but most notably in public works
contracts.
With a slow legal process that requires six to 10 years for cases to proceed
through the courts, the scandals will clog up the entire judicial system -
and leave the fate of hundreds, if not thousands, of Italy's elite uncertain
during a key moment of transition. The investigations themselves threaten to
decapitate the political and business establishment. Another side-effect of
the contracts probes is the paralysing of public works.
Against this background, the cabinet last Friday proposed new rules on
public tendering, aids to restart public works halted by corruption
investigations, and a comprehensive decree governing the financing of
political parties. The latter reflected the text just approved in a Senate
commission. This depenalised illicit funding and removed control of party
financing from the judiciary to the government-appointed prefects.
It was a serious miscalculation to cut out the judiciary, appearing to offer
an easy exit to corrupt politicians by subjecting them to administrative
sanctions. But it was compounded by framing the legislation in a decree
(which has immediate effect but has to be approved by parliament within 60
days).
President Scalfaro on Sunday found a judicious way out by refusing to sign
the decree on the grounds that it conflicted with one of the 10 referendums
due to be held on April 18, that concerning abolition of public funding of
political parties. The government now must either hand the task over
entirely to parliament or frame new laws which accommodate the sensitivities
of both the public and the judiciary.
In the meantime, the referendum on abolition of public financing of
political parties has acquired an infinitely higher profile, and could well
confuse the even more important referendum concerning the reform of the
electoral system. Parliament itself has to find a new head of the
constitutional reform commission to replace Mr Ciriaco de Mita, who resigned
last week because of the involvement of his brother in a corruption scandal.
All these issues weighing down on a weakened government make it ever more
important for electoral reform to be agreed, since early elections appear
the sole alternative for everyone concerned.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Banks attack audit proposals as disruptive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH BANKS yesterday attacked as costly and disruptive a government plan
to require auditors of financial institutions to report to regulators
anything of 'material significance'.
The Treasury's proposed legislation follows recommendations made by the
Bingham report last year on the supervision of the collapsed Bank of Credit
and Commerce International.
But yesterday bankers said the rules were too wide-ranging and would
jeopardise the existing relationship between them, their auditors and
regulators.
Mr Paul Tillett, a director of the British Bankers' Association, said: 'We
think auditors may feel the need to deluge regulators with information which
they don't need.' The effect would be to increase costs and tempt auditors
to deal directly with regulators rather than in three-way discussions with
their clients.
The draft rules refer in general terms to the requirement for auditors of
banks, building societies, insurers and any other companies regulated under
the Financial Services Act to report if they identify anything which would
have a 'material significance to the exercise of regulatory functions'.
At present, auditors have a professional duty to report material fraud to
regulators and are protected from any breach of duty to their clients when
they do so. The Bingham report recommended that this duty be reinforced by
law.
The consultative document published by the Treasury yesterday warns that
auditors failing to comply with new statutory duties could be exposed to
civil liabilities and to disciplinary action by their professional bodies.
It also says regulators would have the power to request a second audit or
disqualify auditors from auditing regulated companies if they failed to
report when under a duty to do so.
The document rejects suggestions that auditors should be required actively
to seek out and report fraud. It said this was not recommended by the
Bingham report and would 'undesirably' change the relationship between
auditors and their clients.
The Treasury said the proposals had been agreed with the key professional
bodies before being issued, and that it would take any additional comments
into account during the consultation period, which finishes on June 1.
The intention would be to bring them into law by October after guidelines on
their application have been circulated by the Auditing Practices Board.
Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the Auditing Practices Board, said: 'I think
(the proposals) will make a difference. The authority will give auditors
additional resolve.' But he added: 'The whole thing doesn't hinge on what
you write down but on what you do. It's all judgmental.'

FT  09 MAR 93 / Government loses Maastricht vote: Major humiliated by
22-vote defeat - Opposition amendment delays ratification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night suffered a humiliating 22-vote defeat in its bid
to speed up the Maastricht ratification process, just two days after the
prime minister had appealed to Conservative rebels to fall into line.
The vote by 314 to 292 in favour of an opposition amendment - the
government's first defeat for three years - means the Maastricht bill must
now go to the report stage, a procedure which could add as much as a month
or more to the ratification process.
While the defeat centres on a minor amendment on the European Committee of
the Regions that will not prevent UK ratification of the treaty, it
represents a serious rebuff for Mr John Major and senior cabinet ministers
in their efforts to strong-arm and cajole the rebels back into the loyalist
fold.
Some 26 Tories defied party whips and voted with the opposition while 22 did
not vote - a much larger rebellion than had been expected. The outcome
provoked a roar of delight and victory salutes from Labour MPs who greeted
the result as a critical blow to the authority of the government.
Party officials claimed it would give the opposition a further opportunity
later this spring to press home its demand for British inclusion in the
treaty's social chapter, although this will depend on the ruling of the
deputy speaker.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, tried to put a brave face on the
outcome, commenting: 'A treaty delayed is better than a treaty lost.' He
said that the prime minister remained determined to have the treaty ratified
by the end of the parliamentary session, adding: 'It does not change the
treaty or our policy to ratify the treaty.'
Nonetheless, it represents a serious setback for the government after a day
in which business managers were locked in talks on tactics in Downing Street
before launching a last-minute charm offensive in the Commons.
Talks with Liberal Democrats came to nothing, though efforts by whips to
persuade seven Scottish and Welsh nationalists to back the government were
successful following a series of political trade-offs.
Only minutes before the vote, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the European minister,
attempted to buy time by asking the deputy speaker, Mr Michael Morris, if
further debate could be had on the Committee of the Regions. But his request
was given an abrupt refusal.
In practical terms, the impact of the amendment is to force the government
to choose only elected local government councillors as British delegates for
the European Committee of the Regions which is due to be formed as soon as
the treaty is ratified.
The government had argued that it wanted the freedom to select UK committee
members from outside the political field, thereby making businessmen or
other prominent local individuals eligible for appointment.
Downing Street made clear last night that those opposing the government's
view were 'voting for delay', while Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman,
charged Mr John Smith and Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Labour and Liberal Democrat
leaders, of 'hypocrisy' after their publicly proclaimed calls for speedy
ratification of the Maastricht accord.
The passing of the amendment means that the bill must go to the report stage
for further debate - a procedure that could have been avoided if the bill
passed through its current committee stage unamended.
Opinion is divided as to how much extra time will now be added before the
bill completes its progress through parliament. Technically, the report
stage could be completed in a day or less and the ultimate decision on what
may be called for further discussion rests with Mr Morris.
But seasoned observers believe anti-Maastricht MPs will be able to employ an
armoury of delaying devices, including points of order, that could mean the
delay is measured in weeks not days.
If that is the case, the government faces deepening humiliation in the eyes
of its European partners, continuing challenges to its authority and
mounting frustration among its own pro-Maastricht MPs.
Sir Teddy Taylor, a leading Tory Euro-sceptic, said backbenchers had wanted
to support the government, but intense pressure on them had hardened their
positions. 'There is a solution here - have a referendum and the rebellion
ends tomorrow,' he said.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Howe urges a hard line on economic direction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG plea for the government to re-establish a clear direction for its
economic strategy with Budget tax increases and spending curbs is made today
by Lord Howe.
The former chancellor and foreign secretary warns in an article in the
Financial Times that a 'Reaganomics-style' budget deficit threatens Britain
with a return to the stop-go economic cycles of the 1960s and 1970s.
Urging Mr Norman Lamont to eschew populist measures in favour of widening
the tax base and curbing tax privileges, Lord Howe says: 'A hard-headed
attempt to explain and address the real problems of our economy is more
likely to reap political reward than playing to the gallery and hoping for
the best.'

Defying danger: heavy gunfire from Serb snipers forces people to run for
cover in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. Shots were hitting the wall as
shoppers and workers crouched and dashed past. Bosnia's army commander,
General Sefir Halilovic, yesterday ordered his forces to launch a
counter-offensive against Bosnian Serb troops in the east of the country 'to
prevent the massacre of innocent people' in besieged Moslem enclaves
following a 10-day assault

FT  09 MAR 93 / Lending lifts shares and recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS of increased lending to British consumers boosted hopes for economic
recovery yesterday and helped lift the UK equity market to a new high.
The rise in share prices was also helped by buoyancy in overseas stock
markets.
Official seasonally adjusted figures showed that UK consumer borrowing
through hire purchase agreements, bank credit cards and from specialist
credit companies amounted to a net Pounds 151m in January, three times the
Pounds 50m expected in the City.
The news, coming after reports of growing business confidence, subdued wage
pressures and last week's cut in German interest rates, added to optimism
about a nascent UK economic upturn and paved the way for strong gains on
financial markets.
A strong start to the US bond market, which later prompted the Wall Street
surge, along with heavy buying of the March stock index futures contract in
London, saw the FT-SE 100 index rise to a new high of 2,957.3, up 35.2.
The strength of international equity markets pushed US stocks up 64.84 to a
record 3,469.42, helped by declining bond yields, growing confidence in the
US economy and programme buying. The buoyancy was also reflected in Tokyo
early today, where the Nikkei average rose more than 300 points initially,
although it began to lose momentum after about an hour's trading.
In London, government securities also closed firm, while sterling maintained
most of Friday's gains, although it was hovering around the DM2.40 level in
late New York trading.
January's increase in UK net consumer credit was the biggest since July
1991. It reflected strong lending by finance houses to car buyers and a
recovery of borrowing on bank credit cards.

FT  09 MAR 93 / Compaq's US cuts may spark PC price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAQ COMPUTER yesterday cut the prices of its personal computers and
printers in the US by up to 20 per cent, sparking fears of a price war which
could put smaller PC suppliers out of business.
Compaq is now considering whether to make corresponding cuts in Europe. If
it does, the effect on Europe's leading suppliers including Viglen of the
UK, Vobis of Germany and IPC of France could be dramatic.
'This year is going to see one of the biggest bloodbaths in the history of
the industry,' Mr Ronald Skates, chief executive of US-based Data General,
said yesterday. PC prices have fallen by up to 40 per cent a year on average
for the past two years. Analysts in the US expect a further fall of about 25
per cent this year.
The prospect of a further price war is good news for customers. US buyers
now expect to be able to buy a PC with Intel's fastest chip, 4m bytes of
fast memory and a 120m byte hard disc for less than Dollars 1,000. Only five
years ago, a less advanced system would have cost in excess of Dollars
5,000. The UK, however, is something of a special case because of the
devaluation of the pound. Some suppliers argue that the UK price war is over
and that prices must rise.
Elonex, for example, a leading supplier, raised its prices by Pounds 50 a
machine last month.
Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Amstrad, another leading UK supplier, warned
recently that the prices at which PCs could be obtained today were unlikely
to be repeated.
Worldwide, the principal beneficiaries of this latest round of price cutting
are likely to be the aristocrats of the industry, Compaq and International
Business Machines. Both have introduced new ranges aimed specifically at the
low end of the market where gross profit margins are thin to the point of
invisibility.
According to one UK-based manufacturer, the average gross profit margin on a
low-end computer is now between 15 and 20 per cent, compared with 40 per
cent in earlier years.
Most suppliers expect another tough year before prices stabilise and profits
return.

COMPAQ COMPUTER yesterday cut the prices of its personal computers and

When Compaq launched its low-cost range in June last year, it provoked a
spasm of price cutting among 'clone' makers - companies that build PCs to
IBM's standard design from off-the-shelf components - that left a number
among them, Everex, Tandon and Zeos, in financial difficulties.
Given the choice between a 'no-name' clone computer and a similar
specification from a well known manufacturer for only a few dollars more,
buyers are opting for the branded product.
Most suppliers expect another tough year before prices stabilise and profits
return.

THE SURGE in business confidence late last year has continued in the first
two months of this year but the government must avoid inflationary pressures
in the Budget, according to the Institute of Directors.
Its report is reinforced by other surveys published today, which detect an
improvement in business and consumer confidence but, wary of proclaiming
green shoots, warn that it could be shortlived.
The institute found that 51 per cent of the 305 directors questioned were
more optimistic about the outlook for the economy than they were six months
ago, compared with 38 per cent in December and 10 per cent in October. The
only region where the level of confidence fell was the Midlands, where 48
per cent were more optimistic compared with 50 per cent in December.
Since December, when the institute argued that interest rate cuts were
needed to end the recession, base rates have been reduced by 1 percentage
point to 6 per cent. According to today's survey directors are even more
confident about their own companies than about the economy - 60 per cent are
more optimistic than six months ago, compared with 48 per cent in December,
with the rise in confidence detectable in all sectors. Only 11 per cent are
less optimistic, particularly in the Midlands.
But fewer directors report that their company has been investing - 49 per
cent in February compared with 53 per cent in December and 52 per cent in
October.
Consumer confidence is recovering slowly a survey by PA Cambridge Economic
Consultants published today shows. 'There are indications that a turning
point has been reached' it concludes, and the quarterly survey's index of
confidence has seen the first rise since June 1992 to 75.2, up from 72.8 in
December.
Of the 1,000 people questioned, 12.4 per cent expect their financial
position to improve in the next three months compared with 9.3 per cent in
December - 20.8 per cent expect it to get worse, but that is down from 25.9
per cent in the last survey. Unemployment continues to be the greatest worry
for 38.2 per cent compared with 41.1 per cent in December.
A new index of activity in consumer industries launched this week by NTC,
the research group, also suggests that the consumer sector is recovering.
NTC reports that the index has been rising sharply for the past five months
because of increases in retail sales, TV advertising, share prices and
recent interest rate cuts.
A more cautious note is sounded in the survey published today by the Finance
&amp; Leasing Association. It reports that 64 per cent of members have seen a
rise in confidence in consumer lending, compared with 8 per cent in October,
but nearly two thirds of members report no change in business lending and 'a
mood of caution' about the future.
FLA members, who handle about 30 per cent of all UK fixed investment and 80
per cent of lending outside clearing banks and building societies, expect
demand for unsecured personal lending and for small-scale business lending
to rise in the next three months.
But Infolink, the consumer credit information group, warned: 'Consumer
confidence may well falter in the run up to the Budget on March 16'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Commons Treasury Committee may question the Inland Revenue about the tax
affairs of Mr John Birt, director-general of the BBC. Mr John Watts, the
committee's Conservative chairman, yesterday called on the Revenue to have a
'very close look' into Mr Birt's tax position.
His remarks followed the disclosure that Mr Birt was paid by the BBC via his
private company, enabling him to pay less tax. Mr Birt has said he is giving
up his freelance status and joining the BBC staff.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Union votes to keep political fund
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 22,000-strong Society of Telecom Executives voted by a majority of 73
per cent to retain its political fund with about 50 per cent of the members
voting in a postal ballot. It was the first union to hold such a ballot
under the government's 10-year rule.
Unlike most unions with political funds, the STE is not affiliated to the
Labour party but union leaders argued it was important to have a fund to
intervene effectively in political debate.

GOVERNMENT troops have surrendered Huambo, Angola's second-biggest city, to
Unita rebels after a two-month battle, military officials said yesterday, AP
reports from Luanda.
Defeat in Huambo, 329 miles south-east of Luanda, is a serious setback for
the government, which committed tens of thousands of troops to the battle.
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said the government would seek foreign
military help to subdue the rebel army, which has taken control of
three-quarters of the country.
Immediately after claiming control of the city, the rebels announced they
would resume peace talks if the government stopped bombing Huambo.
An armed band has attacked the camp of UN ceasefire monitors in the Cabinda
enclave, north of Luanda. No one was injured, but all monitors will be
evacuated from the region. UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has
denounced the 'outrageous harassment' of the UN teams.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Italian PM urged to rethink corruption decrees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro last night invited prime minister
Giuliano Amato to reconsider controversial decrees reducing the political
impact of the corruption investigations sweeping the country.
Mr Scalfaro's step, in a formal letter to the prime minister, followed the
resignation of environment minister Carlo Ripa di Meana from the government
in protest over the decrees.
Mr Ripa di Meana, who resigned from the Socialist party last month, is the
fourth minister to quit in less than a month. Mr Amato's finance, health and
justice ministers all left after falling under suspicion.
The judiciary and opposition parties reacted with hostility to the decrees.
Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, chief public prosecutor in Milan, where
investigations began, said the decrees would lead to paralysis of the
investigations and make it impossible to discover who was responsible.
The decrees, approved by the cabinet on Friday, would transfer the
investigation of illegal political funding from magistrates to politically
appointed regional prefects. They would make the offence punishable by fines
and a ban from office rather than prison.
The plans attempt to distinguish the widespread practice of illegal funding
from the more 'serious' crimes of demanding and paying bribes, which would
remain criminal offences.
Magistrates in Milan met yesterday to consider the implications of the
decrees, which would absolve many politicians now under scrutiny. Mr
Borrelli later said the views of the five judges leading the investigations
were 'exactly opposed to the sense of the proposals'.
Earlier, Mr Gerardo D'Ambrosio, Milan's deputy public prosecutor, said: 'The
public will find it difficult to accept that those being accused should
decide to let themselves off.'
The national magistrates' association expressed concern about the measures
and the use of decrees to push them through.
The strength of opposition to the government's plans, broadly reflected in
leading newspapers, suggests ministers will face a hard time obtaining the
necessary support for the proposals. They can become law immediately but
must subsequently be backed by parliament.
The measures were designed to minimise the disruption to public life caused
by almost daily disclosures of kickbacks and illegal party funding. They
were strongly defended by Mr Amato and Mr Giovanni Conso, justice minister,
who drafted the decrees.
Both men denied the plans were designed to muzzle the inquiries, which have
led to the arrest of more than 100 politicians, businessmen and party
officials. Mr Conso said the measures, which would make illegal funding no
longer a criminal offence, were a tough response to the problems raised by
the inquiries and not an attempt to duck 'the moral question'.
It was disclosed yesterday that Mr Giovanni Prandini, former minister of
public works, is under investigation.
