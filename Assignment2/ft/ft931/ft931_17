FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: CRH down 8% to IPounds 57.6m

<TEXT>
CRH, the Irish construction and building materials group, which spent
IPounds 101m on acquisitions and capital expenditure in 1992, suffered an 8
per cent decline in pre-tax profits to IPounds 57.6m (Pounds 58.8m) on
turnover down 3 per cent to IPounds 1.11bn for 1992.
Mr Tony Barry, chief executive said: 'While we do look forward to
improvements in some of our operations, particularly in the US, the current
year seems certain to witness difficult conditions in a number of our
markets. Although 1993 will be another tough year, severe pruning of our
costs has our companies in good shape'.
He said the labour force in the group's UK division had been cut by 700 to
3,000, and 19 mixed concrete and pre-cast concrete installations had been
mothballed in Spain to weather out the recession in its European operations.
Nonetheless, operating costs rose 2 per cent to IPounds 263m, which Mr Barry
put down to rationalisation costs and the incorporation of acquisitions in
the Netherlands in 1992.
He said that 'a further serious decline' in the UK construction industry
during 1992, together with severe price competition, was responsible for the
low margin of IPounds 4m profits on a IPounds 303m turnover in the UK
market.
Earnings per share declined by 8 per cent to 16.05p (17p).
A proposed final dividend of 4.5p for a total of 6.75 (6.45p) is
recommended.
COMMENT
CRH's earnings performance in 1993 will be particularly sensitive to
construction activity in the Irish market, which in 1992 contributed 45 per
cent of profits but only 19 per cent of turnover. Despite a 22 per cent
promised increase in government construction spending this year,
construction activity is broadly forecast to decline overall by some 4 per
cent. The European outlook is equally bleak. An anticipated upturn in US
activity will partially offset this, which will give volume growth, but
little scope for profit margin increases. The group's strong cash position
might offer scope for some bargain-hunting acquisitions, adding to
profitability when the outlook improves. Earnings forecasts range from 13.5p
to 16p for 1993, depending on one's outlook for the Irish market, but which
suggests there may be further discounting in the price ahead. This might
explain the sweetener to shareholders of further growth in dividend.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Argyll splits Safeway and Presto/Lo-Cost
chains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGYLL, the UK's third largest food retailing group, is splitting its
Safeway and Presto/Lo-Cost chains into two separate divisions.
Mr David Webster, Argyll's deputy chairman, said the move was 'a tidying up,
rather than a fundamental change'. But he added that the new structure would
particularly benefit Presto and Lo-Cost which would be able to make more
effective use of Argyll's support functions as they strove to expand and
improve efficiency through new technology.
Mr Patrick Kieran, presently managing director of Safeway operations,
becomes managing director of the Safeway Stores division. His deputy will be
Mr Logan Taylor, now managing director of Safeway trading and marketing.
Mr Charles Lawrie, the Argyll director who has been responsible for Presto
and Lo-Cost for seven years, is appointed managing director of the
newly-created Presto and Lo-Cost Stores division.
Argyll acquired Lo-Cost in 1981 when it bought Oriel Foods - a food
manufacturing and retailing business which had been founded by the original
Argyll management team but then sold to RCA Corporation.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Terry's sale greeted with relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELIEF WAS the dominant emotion yesterday at Terry's Chocolate Works in
York, after staff heard that the company had been sold to Kraft General
Foods International for Pounds 220m.
'The general reaction is, thank God it's all over,' said Mr Vic Botterill,
chief shop steward at the factory for the General Municipal Boilermakers
Union, which represents the plant's 800 blue collar employees and up to 200
casual workers.
Mr Botterill said the sale to KGFI, part of Philip Morris, the large US
tobacco and foods group, could allow the Chocolate Works, source of
chocolate oranges and the All Gold and Moonlight ranges to gain some more
lines.
He said the employees were glad that Terry's had not been sold to Cadbury
Schweppes or Nestle, because of their competing product ranges. There had
been fears, he said, that such a deal could have resulted in product ranges
being moved from Terry's York plant.
'We have the facilities here, we have the potential: it's a big world out
there,' said Mr Botterill.
There was some sadness, he added, that United Biscuits had sold. 'Everybody
slags off employers but they've put in a lot of investment.'
Terry's was founded in 1767 by two citrus peel importers, who opened a shop
making and selling sweets in Bootham, York. In 1823 they were joined by an
apothecary, Mr Joseph Terry. Subsequent expansion led the company to its
present imposing five-storey building, often glimpsed on television
broadcasts of horse racing from York.
Despite its strong tourist image, York has traditionally had an important
manufacturing base, founded on the twin pillars of the railways and
confectionery.
Terry's, with just over 1,000 employees, is the second biggest confectioner.
Nestle employs 4,500 in the city and Cravens about 600.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Property charges hit BICC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE second year running the profits of BICC, the cables and construction
group, were depressed by charges of more than Pounds 40m on its property
portfolio and the Channel tunnel contract.
The pre-tax figure slipped to Pounds 77m (Pounds 81m) on turnover of Pounds
3.65bn (Pounds 3.79bn).
This followed a further Pounds 35m write-down on the UK property portfolio,
including the Spitalfields joint venture. Another Pounds 8m (Pounds 12m) was
added to BICC's share of Channel tunnel losses.
As promised with last year's Pounds 154m rights issue, BICC is paying a
final dividend of 13.25p, to make an unchanged total of 19.25p.
Most of the Pounds 64m bill was drawn from reserves.
Earnings per share, affected by the 1-for-5 issue in June, fell to 6.6p
(10.3p) - or 20.2p before exceptional charges.
Mr Robin Biggam, chairman, said the Pounds 35m property write-down was
against uncompleted property and Spitalfields accounted for over half of
that portfolio. Last year's Pounds 30m write-down was against completed
properties.
Overall profit was flat at Pounds 148m (Pounds 146m) before interest costs
of Pounds 28m (Pounds 23m).
In BICC Cables, whose business is mainly in Europe, there was a 14 per cent
decline to Pounds 78m - on sales of Pounds 946m (Pounds 933m) - because of
weakness in the energy and telecoms markets.
The group had taken its stake in GGC, of Spain, to 67 per cent and was
reducing the number of factories from five to three. The acquisition of KWO,
in eastern Germany, had only recently been completed.
North America Cables was still making a small loss of Pounds 2m (Pounds 3m).
Mr Biggam expressed some optimism for this year, following signs of economic
recovery and the further rationalisation opportunities offered by the
purchase of Reynold.
Australasia had recovered to Pounds 33m (Pounds 26m) after a long period of
decline. Competition in the telecoms market had helped to move the business
forward.
Balfour Beatty, the construction wing, again showed its resilience with
profits of Pounds 40m (Pounds 38m) on turnover of Pounds 1.85bn (Pounds
1.9bn). Civil and power contracting had held up well and an increasing
amount of work was being won overseas. House building incurred a small loss.
Net debt rose to Pounds 59m (Pounds 35m) after nearly Pounds 100m was taken
on to the balance sheet from the Spanish subsidiary and after Pounds 80m of
acquisition payments. This was offset by the rights issue. About Pounds 37m
of cash was generated after interest, dividends, tax and capital spending.
Off balance sheet debt came down to Pounds 126m (Pounds 197m).

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Question over Eurotunnel payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL HAS withdrawn its offer to make extra payments of cash and shares
to Transmanche Link, the group of British and French contractors building
the Channel tunnel, Mr Robin Biggam, BICC chairman, said yesterday.
This had again halted negotiations over the contractors' claims for
additional payments of more than Pounds 1bn to cover the extra cost of the
project.
Balfour Beatty, BICC's construction arm, is part of the TML consortium. Mr
Biggam said he had received a letter from Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's
chief executive, in the past few days saying that the offer was no longer on
the table.
Sir Alastair declined yesterday to confirm whether or not the offer had
lapsed, saying: 'Any correspondence between myself and the owners of TML is
private.' He said TML had walked out of negotiations last December.
Eurotunnel is understood to have offered to pay Pounds 1.2bn in 1985 prices
in a combination of cash and paper - shares, bonds and convertible
instruments - to cover the cost of fitting out the rail tunnels. The gap
between the two sides earlier this year was said to be less than Pounds
100m, also in 1985 prices.
Failure to reach agreement means BICC yesterday announced a provision of
Pounds 8m to cover any losses on the contract.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hartstone shares hit by unexpected charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Hartstone, the hosiery and leather goods group, continued to slide
yesterday as the company issued a profits warning and revealed unexpected
rationalisation costs for its European operations.
After a volatile week in which rumours about a possible bid and a profits
downgrading from house brokers BZW forced the shares down from 272p, they
closed yesterday 18p lower at 149p.
The market appeared to ignore Hartstone's forecast of an increased dividend,
which accompanied the details of the European rationalisation.
In a statement yesterday, the group said it expected exceptional charges of
Pounds 8.5m - a substantial part of which related to cost-cutting in France
and Spain - in the year to March 31. Before this week, the market had
factored in costs of just Pounds 2m relating to reorganisation in the UK.
Hartstone also said profits for the year would be 'less satisfactory than
was expected at the time of the interims', due to a sharp downturn in
European hosiery markets over the last three months. Gearing was also
expected to be not less than the 80 per cent reported in November, partly
due to the costs and exchange rate movements.
Mr Stephen Barker, chairman, said the company had intended to announce the
exceptional costs on Monday, after it had informed staff. The reorganisation
will entail the loss of 855 jobs, leaving roughly 2,700 employees.
Referring to the share price decline he said: 'There are lots of companies
coming out with reorganisations and people respond positively because they
are actively managing their business. That is all we are trying to do.'
Hartstone, which is often cited as an acquisitive company, had not made a
purchase in 15 months, he added.
Analysts said, however, that the decline reflected the market's
dissatisfaction at being presented with a set of costs which it had not
expected.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Airtours queries benefits of Owners/Cook
tie-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the holiday tour operator, yesterday questioned the benefits that
rival Owners Abroad says it would achieve from a proposed tie-up with Thomas
Cook, the travel agency and financial services group.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said there was a great difference
between identifying costs savings from his proposed takeover of Owners
Abroad, and projecting increased sales.
Airtours also said that according to latest statistics from Stats MR, the
market research organisation, Owners Abroad's winter business was down at
the end of January. This meant that Owners Abroad would be making higher
winter losses from leased aircraft capacity that is surplus to needs.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, said estimates of benefits from the
tie-up with Thomas Cook and its sister LTU, the German holiday company, had
been approved by its auditors and advisers. These would be at least Pounds
9m in 1994 and at least Pounds 11m the following year.
He said Airtours still had not specified how it would arrive at savings from
a merged Airtours and Owners Abroad that Mr Crossland says would be
'significantly' above the benefits from the Thomas Cook tie-up.

An increased final dividend of 4.44p is recommended, for a total of 8p
(7.125p).

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Talks over Isosceles refinancing get under
way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Parties involved in the Pounds 1.4bn refinancing of Isosceles, parent of the
Gateway food retail chain, are now starting talks over the deal which needs
to be agreed in principle by the end of this month.
This follows the presentation of the company's business plan to its banks
last Friday.
Talks are expected to be complex, and in the initial stages much semi-public
posturing is expected.
The banks have put forward a suggestion that Gateway should adopt Pounds
800m of the total debt, which comprises bank loans of Pounds 1.05bn and
mezzanine debt of Pounds 350m, with the rest passed to the parent company.
However, others involved say this idea is 'almost certainly completely
unrealistic'. Gateway, some say, is not capable of supporting more than
perhaps Pounds 400m of debt if it is also to finance capital spending from
cashflow.
The business plan forecast that Gateway would record a Pounds 103m operating
profit in the financial year to end April, compared with a Pounds 187.4m
profit in 1991-92. Further, profits are expected to fall again before they
recover.
The 1992-93 figures will also bear interest charges, including rolled up
interest, of Pounds 153m, and 'kitchen sink' provisions covering
restructuring, property write-downs, fees for the refinancing and other
items, taking the pre-tax loss to Pounds 335m.
Another suggestion for the refinancing is that a large part of the debt
should be swapped into equity. However, this proposal also faces
difficulties because of the position of the equity holders, and particularly
Wasserstein Perella, the New York investment firm, which has 30 per cent of
the equity, and through its holding of A shares which can exercise
significant control over Isosceles.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Access to Equity: Coming to grips with City language
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LANGUAGE USED in the debate on smaller company development can sometimes be
more confusing than enlightening. The following glossary aims to describe
the key elements regularly referred to, yet seldom explained.
Business Angels: In the US, wealthy private individuals are keen investors
in small businesses. Attempts have been made to create similar networks in
the UK, though their impact has been limited. Angels are long-term
investors, they do not charge the high fees of professional venture
capitalists, and they often have business experience to help out their
investee companies
Business Expansion Scheme: Created to allow investors to buy shares in small
unquoted companies and receive tax relief. The scheme will close at the end
of the year.
Competent Authority: Determines listing rules with which companies must
comply to join the Official List. The Financial Services Act decrees that
the UK has only one authority overseeing the Official List and that is the
London Stock Exchange. Part five of the FSA (still being drafted) is
expected to entitle the Secretary of State to empower bodies other than the
Stock Exchange to authorise listings.
Delta Notice Board: Displays prices for companies traded under Rule 535.2
Development Capitalists: Generally fund management buy-outs and buy-ins.
Originally intended to be one step up from venture/seed capitalists.
Liquidity: The depth of the market in a company's shares. The market in a
smaller company's shares is often less liquid due to various factors: market
capitalisation, the number of shares issued and the narrow spread of
ownership.
Listing Rules: Established by the Stock Exchange and comprising a somewhat
complicated regime of initial and on-going standards to which listed
companies must comply. The Exchange's ability to act is restricted by EC
directives.
London Stock Exchange: Has three different roles - (a) the competent
authority for listing in the UK and regulates the so-called primary market
for distribution of new issues; (b) operates and regulates a secondary
market for buying and selling shares; (c) a clearing house for the
settlement of trades in UK equities.
Marketmakers: Obliged to display firm bid or offer prices on Seaq and deal
at those prices using their own capital. The size of the spread between the
best bid and offer price on Seaq can deter investing in less liquid
securities. Investors should note that, when dealing in reasonable amounts
of stock, the quoted price is only a basis for negotiation. Nasdaq: The
North American market operated by the National Association of Securities
Dealers, was once dedicated to smaller companies but many grew large.
Developed out of the OTC market, and now the third largest equity market in
the world.
Official List: Securities that have been admitted to the market by the Stock
Exchange. The vast majority of the 2,200 or so companies on the list are
valued at less than Pounds 50m.
Over the counter market: Once referred to trading of shares in unlisted
securities. In the early 1980s a pseudo-market was operated by Harvard
Securities among others. It satisfied demand from those investors seeking
high growth and prepared to take risks. The UK no longer has an OTC market,
but the term is often used to refer to the Nasdaq market which has an OTC
tier.
Recognised investment exchange: A market, such as Nasdaq or Liffe, for the
buying and selling of securities. Must have a rule book that ensures fair
play and can be enforced. The LSE has not been granted, but in effect
enjoys, a monopoly in UK equity trading.
Seaq: The Stock Exchange's main dealing system for the USM and fully listed
companies. It displays bid and offer prices provided by competing
marketmakers who are obliged to quote prices throughout the day. Introduced
in 1986, it is increasingly seen as a less than ideal method of trading in
small companies.
Seats: Stock Exchange Alternative Trading System. Provides company
information, customer limit orders and, in some cases, a single marketmaker
providing a continuous two-way price on a single dealing screen. It is
widely regarded as more in tune with smaller company trading. It is not a
separate market and trades USM and Official List securities.
Shells: Small companies with few assets which can provide an attractive
route to the stock market via a reverse takeover by a private company.
Small businesses: Privately-owned, often family-owned, where the owners and
the managers are one and the same. The Companies Act defines them as
companies with two of the following three characteristics - turnover up to
Pounds 2.8m, a balance sheet total of up to Pounds 1.4m, and up to 50
employees.
Small companies: Not to be confused with small businesses. Generally defined
as companies valued at less than Pounds 150m; some leading institutional
investors would pitch the threshold at Pounds 250m. Roughly speaking, 80 per
cent of listed compnaies are categorised as small.
Third Market: For companies that failed to meet the USM requirements. Low
regulatory requirements and the questionable activities of some sponsors
undermined its image. It was closed in 1989. Unlisted Securities Market:
Operated by the Stock Exchange for securities which do not meet the
requirements of the Official List. A primary market regime distinguished by
less onerous intial and on-going listing requirements. Trading of USM
securities is no different than in listed securities. The USM captured the
entrepreneurial spirit of the 1980s boom period and attracted 850 companies.
While most are small, some have been capitalised at more than Pounds 1bn.
Venture Capital: Few venture capitalists are nowadays willing to provide
seed capital for start-ups. Venture capitalists need suitable exit routes to
realise their investments and thus are concerned about proposals to close
the USM.
The 535.2 market: Stock Exchange Rule 535.2 allows member firms to seek
special dispensation to deal in the shares of companies not on the Official
List or the USM. These stocks are normally dealt on a matched bargain basis,
and include household names such as Weetabix.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Access to Equity: USM debate shifts focus as deadline nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW'S deadline for responses to the Stock Exchange's proposed closure
of the Unlisted Securities Market has brought into focus previously
ambiguous and often confused arguments about a second market devoted to
smaller companies.
After years of dipping into a variety of informal markets - from over the
counter to Rule 535.2 - participants are now calling for a long-term
solution to the public trading of smaller companies. For most, this means
the creation of one or more tiers on the official list, excluding the
FTSE-350, which would carry less onerous requirements.
Yet this argument appears not to have reached the stock exchange in detailed
form. The exchange is believed to have received fewer than 50 responses so
far and to be disappointed with both the quantity and quality.
Two main concerns appear to be occupying those who have responded; first,
inheritance tax exemptions for companies on the USM, and second, the costs
of moving to the official list.
The stock exchange is believed to feel that neither is crucial enough to
halt the demise of the USM. The tax concerns have been raised by just 10 USM
companies. Nevertheless, the issue will almost certainly have been addressed
in the stock exchange's Budget submission.
On the second concern, the costs of moving to the main market will be
largely eliminated by EC directives on listing particulars and concessions
from the exchange itself.
Such moves are welcome, yet critics say they fail to address the problems of
companies seeking to come to the market for the first time. The issue is
made more pressing with the recent stock market revival in smaller
companies.
The newest lobby group, the City Group for Smaller Companies, argues that
the closure of the USM before a viable alternative is hammered out shows a
lack of concern for this demand by the stock exchange.
Cisco is angling for segmentation of the official list - ie setting up
categories according to market capitalisation with appropriate class tests
according to size.
Although the group has not yet produced an official policy statement on such
a move, Richard Balarkas, chief executive, says the most common view is that
companies outside the FTSE-350 should be governed by less onerous
regulations.
Small company brokers, such as Albert E Sharp, tend to agree that a tier
system on the existing list is the best possible route. 'There is a certain
credibility attached to something governed by the stock exchange,' says Mr
Eddie McCutcheon, head of corporate finance at Sharp's. Although the
exchange would have to continue its regulatory role, Mr McCutcheon argues
that it should be possible to set a 'cut off below Pounds 50m (market
capitalisation) where the rules are a little easier'.
The stock exchange, for its part, would argue that a two or more tier system
is likely to occur through evolution (although it would also say that it
would be difficult to ease the requirements at the lower end while
maintaining a regulatory role).
Plans for the development of a Europe-wide trading facility for the largest
companies could leave a national market with little more than those very
companies that Cisco wants to highlight. Thus, by default, the stock
exchange would be running a smaller companies market.
One source close to the exchange described such evolution as occurring
through 'the creation of a premier league, rather than the setting up of a
fifth division'.
Such evolution could take too long for those in the small company sector.
Although they are demanding action now, little is likely to come of the
recommendations received so far. The best that small company pundits can
hope for might be the delay of the deadline for new admissions to the USM
until amendments to EC directives take effect. Even that largely symbolic
gesture would be welcome. 'I think I would like to see that firmly in place
before they pull down the shutters on the USM,' says Mr McCutcheon.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Access to Equity: Growth options for 'minnows' of the quoted
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW COMPANIES, however small, regret having a quotation.
The ability to issue paper is bound to open avenues down which private
companies are unlikely to travel. However, small companies are increasingly
constrained.
With stockbrokers drawing back from following, let alone making, markets in
the shares of smaller companies, there is pressure for the minnows of the
quoted sector to do something or risk further deterioration of the liquidity
in their stocks.
A case in point is Umeco, the USM-quoted maker of aircraft refuelling
equipment and distributor of seals and components to the aerospace industry.
Recession in the world economy, and in particular in the aerospace industry,
partly explains a less than distinguished share price performance since it
came to the USM in 1989. But the slide in its market capitalisation, from
about Pounds 7m to Pounds 1.75m today, may have been exaggerated because the
company is so small.
Mr George Metcalfe, Umeco chairman, says the company is capable of growing
its markets and will be well positioned to do so when recovery comes. But
size remains one of his principle concerns. 'You have to do something,' he
says. 'The possibility of doing nothing is not an option.'
'Organic growth will not take you along the road far enough or fast enough.
You have to combine organic and acquisition-led growth. It is the only way
to grow sufficiently to attain critical mass,' he says.
For companies such as Umeco, Mr Metcalfe says there are limited options if
they want to retain a quote.
The first is to find a dormant, or semi-dormant, shell into which to
reverse; this vehicle would most probably already have a full listing.
Another option is a straightforward merger. The problem here lies with
potential personality clashes. If the existing management is to have a say
in running the enlarged group the two companies will probably have to be of
a similar size.
As a result, the enlarged company would only double or triple the size of
the original company. In Umeco's case, for example, this would lead to a
merged company with a market capitalisation of less than Pounds 6m.
A third option is that a private company might seek to reverse into a
company such as Umeco. In an enlarged form, the two companies would progress
to a full listing that would be out of reach for each on its own.
Not surprisingly, Mr Metcalfe's immediate concern, apart from the low share
price, is the lack of liquidity in the company's stock; a Pounds 5,000 trade
is capable of moving the share price.
But he dismisses some of the more usual complaints from very small
companies. Umeco pays no more for auditing or non-executive directors now
that it is quoted. Such costs are an essential part of running a company
properly, quoted or unquoted.
And despite Umeco's less than illustrious stock market career, it did
successfully raise Pounds 55,000 in 1991 to make a part paper acquisition of
an aviation supply company.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Access to Equity: Closure would put 'brake on enterprise'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIEWED FROM the City, the threatened demise of the Unlisted Securities
Market may be seen as the end of an experiment that has outlived its
usefulness and profitability.
For the growing medium-sized business and the venture capital community, the
market's passing will be a serious setback.
It will deprive small companies of an important method of financing growth
through equity, and venture capitalists of a valuable exit from their
investments. The USM played an important part in the rapid expansion of the
venture capital industry during the 1980s.
Worryingly, plans to shut the USM come at a time when concerns are growing
about the ability of banks to provide loan finance. Chastened by losses on
their small loans books, the banks are expected to be cautious about lending
when the upturn comes. Now, if ever, is the time when small businesses need
equity.
Not that a stock market listing is the preferred outlet for the ambitious
entrepreneur. Far more businesses opt for a trade sale - that is, a sale to
another, usually larger company. In 1991, according to the European Venture
Capital Association, twice as many UK companies chose a trade sale as went
for a flotation.
Trade sales make sense for a number of reasons. They allow the venture
capitalist to get all his money back in one go and free the entrepreneur to
retire or to start up all over again. They frequently realise more money
than a listing because a trade buyer can benefit from filling a gap in his
market or product range. Equally important, some business owners do not
relish the obligations and limitations imposed by managing a quoted company.
But even if trade sales have proved more attractive over the years, the
shutting down of the USM option is causing serious concerns in the venture
capital industry.
'Unless a young company can have access to the public market at an earlier
stage than is now possible there will be a brake put upon enterprise,' says
Mr Ronald Cohen, chairman of Apax Partners and a member of Cisco, the City
Group for Smaller Companies.
Companies could wait longer until they matched the criteria for a full
market listing but this may mean market openings are missed or technological
developments would have to be foregone.
The founders might then find themselves forced to sell as the only way of
finding the money for expansion. This would further worsen Britain's already
poor record for generating independent, medium-sized companies on the model
of the German Mittelstand.
The lack of equity for small businesses and the poor liquidity for smaller
UK listed stocks has prompted a flurry of activity aimed at creating
alternatives. The options being considered are:
A Europe-wide exchange owned and operated by the European venture capital
industry. Provisionally titled the European Private Equity Exchange, this
market would be self-regulating - operating as an investors' club. It would
recommend valuations, provide a quotation service and complete transactions.
The brainchild of Baring Venture Partners, a UK venture capital company, it
would allow venture capitalists to trade their portfolio companies.
National exchanges run on the model of the Dutch Participations Exchange
launched by the Dutch venture capital industry. This exchange would open
twice a year, provisionally May and November, and would allow venture
capitalists to auction their shareholdings in investee companies. Both EPEE
and the Dutch exchange are being studied by the European Venture Capital
Association though there are concerns that EPEE may be over-ambitious.
A relaunched USM-style market. If the London Stock Exchange can be persuaded
to relaunch a smaller companies' market it needs to be in a radically
different format, says Mr Robert Drummond, chairman of the British Venture
Capital Association.
It must not carry a label that suggests it is a second-class market. The USM
and the Third Market - closed in 1990 - both carried titles which branded
them as less than first-class arenas for the trading of shares. Any new
market must also have sensible rules designed to appeal to the owners of,
and investors in, small growth businesses. It must not be weighed down by
excessive legislation intended to protect investors from their own follies.
Finally, says Mr Drummond, the trading system should not depend on finding
marketmakers but, like the US Nasdaq market, it should be a screen-based
system allowing deals between principals.
If none of these proposals comes to anything, UK companies might consider a
listing on Nasdaq itself. Nasdaq says it has sought links with a European
exchange to provide a service for European companies but they have seen its
approaches as a threat. As it is, more than 250 non-US companies already
have a Nasdaq listing.
Nasdaq has 4,400 stocks quoted on its two main markets and listed 422 new
entrants in 1992. It is a successful market which can offer smaller
companies liquidity unparalleled on any of the European stock exchanges.
But a Nasdaq listing means frequent visits to the US to stay in touch with
local investors and offends European sensibilities. Until a viable market
place for smaller company stocks can be established in Europe, however,
Nasdaq will remain an attractive option for growing businesses.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Access to Equity: Xenova plumps for ease of US offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN XENOVA, a UK bio-techonology company, was seeking to raise its next
stage of financing last year, it became the obvious solution to tap the US
market rather than seek more cash in the UK.
Mr Phillip Price, finance director, said: 'There is much more understanding
of bio-tech companies in the US. It is a lot easier to make an offering in
the US than the UK.'
The alternative would have been a private placing with UK institutional
investors.
But with only one bio-tech company listed on the Stock Exchange there are
not many analysts covering the industry. Xenova did not feel it could act as
a pioneer, educating investors.
Xenova completed a Dollars 30.3m (Pounds 21.3m) private placement of equity
at the turn of the year. Mr Price said that part of the attraction of the
offering was that it was made under Regulation D of the Securities Act in
the US.
This allows exemptions from the Securities and Exchange Commission if the
placement is targeted at high net worth individuals. There is not a similar
system in the UK.
Xenova's next aim is to go public, and this is also expected to be in the
US, at least in the first instance, if only because the group now has many
US shareholders.
Until the latest offer, Xenova had been financed largely by venture capital.
The company was established in 1987 and, including the latest financing, has
raised a total of Pounds 35.9m in equity and has not resorted to debt
finance. The money has funded research into new drugs.
Xenova has yet to start clinical trials on any of its drugs and so a return
for investors in terms of profits or dividends is still some way off.
However, according to Mr Price, Xenova had outgrown the venture capital
market. 'We were past the stage where venture capitalists could meet our
needs.'
The previous round of funding, in December 1990, had raised Pounds 7m, when
some UK institutions came in, such as Standard Life and Norwich Union. But
the US offer would have been too large for the venture capital market.
Mr Price said the group had had a good experience of dealing with venture
capitalists. Their backers had made an effort to 'understand what we are
doing.'
One problem can be that venture capital funds have fixed lives and must look
for an exit when the funds have to be wound up.
This has already happened to Xenova with one early investor having to sell
its shares to the others. The same problem faces another backer, although
the flotation should come in time to provide a way out.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Access to Equity: A question of sink or swim on the main
market - Increasing concerns that are facing the smaller companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL COMPANIES and their advisers have been increasingly concerned that an
'equity gap' has yawned before them, making it hard for them to raise
long-term capital other than debt finance.
Small quoted companies are questioning whether they should continue with the
expense of a listing. Unquoted ones are deterred from going public or
raising equity privately. This is increasingly being seen as bad for the UK
economy. Small companies are the big companies of the future. A number of
events have fuelled this worry. The Stock Exchange's decision to close the
Unlisted Securities Market, after the previous failure of the Third Market,
will remove a 'nursery' market for smaller companies. Companies will have to
sink or swim on the main list.
The move by some brokers to stop marking markets in smaller stocks has made
it even harder for investors to deal in such companies, although in response
to this the Stock Exchange has introduced the Seat order-driven system of
trading. Similarly, there is little analysts' research into smaller
companies.
Public companies may find themselves caught in a size trap, Mr Michael
Higgins of Charterhouse, the merchant bank says. 'They go public on the
promise of access to capital markets but unless they move quickly they get
trapped.' After the initial interest generated at the flotation, unless the
market capitalisation moves up swiftly - usually through issues of shares
for acquisitions - the interest can fade.
But if they remain private, companies can find it difficult to raise equity
capital on terms they are happy to agree, and many have resorted to debt
finance despite the high interest rates of recent years.
Many smaller companies, according to Mr Richard Balarkas, a leading light in
the City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco), are unaware of the role equity
markets have to play. He suggests that the Stock Exchange has not done all
it could to provide markets to meet the needs of smaller companies. Future
attempts, he says, should be managed separately from the Stock Exchange's
main list.
Recession has taken its toll, too. Smaller companies perform worse in
downturns, in part because they are usually more reliant on the UK economy
than large companies which are likely to have international activities.
However, all is not gloom. Mr Higgins says that now people are focusing on
the problem some solutions are being put forward.
Also as an end of recession institutional investors report a markedly more
positive attitude to investment in small companies in the last few months.
Retail investors are also reported to be buying again as they seek a better
return than is available from deposit accounts.
This week the Pilot Investment Trust was launched specifically to invest in
companies with a market value of under Pounds 30m.
Even so there remains a problem for the smallest companies. As one
institutional investor put it: 'Not many people want to look at things under
Pounds 20m. You cannot get a big enough holding to make it worth bothering
with.' However, he added that illiquidity is not always a problem. 'People
are prepared to put up with illiquidity if they think they have found a good
story'.
Mr David Lowes, a corporate finance director of Robert Fleming, the merchant
bank, has found a similar problem. 'Companies on the stock market valued at
under Pounds 20m have considerable difficulty in raising interest among
institutional investors', he says. Fleming's corporate finance department
'is cautious of encouraging anybody to go to market at that level', he adds.
If small companies cannot go public, they may try to find private equity
capital. But one of the main sources, venture capitalists, also has its
drawbacks.
Mr John Jackson, the chairman of a number of smaller groups and a director
of the new Pilot trust says: 'Private companies are nervous of venture
capital because they feel that venture capitalists understandable interest
in exit routes will lead them to be nudged in directions not necessarily in
the best interests of their businesses.'
A recent survey of private companies carried out by Baker Tilly, the
accountants, found an over-dependency on short-term capital provided by
clearing banks despite accusations that banks 'turned their backs' in the
recession. Fear of losing control was cited by these companies as another
reason for avoiding venture capital. Solutions fall into two broad groups.
First, there are various plans to develop new markets, such as Cisco's
proposal for a separately managed market and the move to develop a
'Euro-Nasdaq' along the lines of the US screen based dealing system.
Any new market must, however, be more robust than the previous ones which
have disappeared when circumstances get difficult. Mr Balarkas says that any
new market 'must be one which does not disappear when the next recession
comes along.'
But there are also calls for a change in the investment culture in the UK.
Mr Jackson argues that years of high interest rates in the UK have made
equity providers demand high rates of return which can be hard for companies
to achieve. 'If you are an ordinary company with ordinary prospects it is
difficult to persuade people to invest in equity', he says.
Further the institutional savings industry, spawned by tax breaks which are
now largely abolished, means there is a much smaller retail market in the UK
than in the US, for example. There is a different attitude to risk in the UK
which can put investors off. 'Any healthy economy has to have a large number
of young companies, and must accept that some will not succeed,' Mr Jackson
says.
Mr Balarkas suggests that there is still a core of retail investors
interested in buying shares in small companies - perhaps local to them.
But hopes of offsetting the tax breaks that spawned the big institutions
with new tax concessions for direct share ownership are unlikely to come to
fruition. Those tax breaks that have been introduced to help investment,
such as the Business Expansion Scheme, have sometimes been abused by tax
avoidance schemes.
Mr Lowes concludes: 'The question is, is it a structural problem or is it
that we are in a recession and people are not parting with their money? For
good companies, there should always be a solution - it's up to the City to
communicate its requirement for investment and up to companies to understand
the requirements investors place on them'.

FT  04 MAR 93 / MTS container port company seeks restructuring after losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARITIME Transport Services, the company developing the new Thamesport
container facility at the Isle of Grain in Kent, is discussing a financial
restructuring with its banks after making pre-tax losses of Pounds 18.5m in
1991, mainly due to interest charges.
According to the company's latest accounts, filed at Companies House three
weeks late, MTS breached some of its banking covenants last May. The company
agreed with its banks to defer about Pounds 9.5m of interest payments and
has negotiated a Pounds 2m overdraft extension. The directors, led by chief
executive Mr Geoffrey Parker, said they hoped to complete the restructuring
before the end of May.
The company has drawn down about Pounds 110m of its arranged loan facilities
of Pounds 150m, and is not likely to seek new facilities under the
restructuring. According to one of the main institutional backers, 'everyone
is happy with the management, it's just been very tough trading'.
Thamesport, which was developed from a greenfield site and designed to be
one of the most modern facilities in the UK, has been hit by recession and
has not met its targets for container throughput. The port is operating at
about one-third its annual capacity of 400,000 containers.
A company spokesman confirmed restructuring talks were 'actively' under way.
'The banks are very positive and unanimously in support of the
restructuring,' he said.
The 1991 figures, which show a pre-interest loss of Pounds 1m, covered the
port's first full year's trading and included a full contribution from
Evergreen, the Taiwanese carrier which switched to Thamesport from
Felixstowe. Since then, other large shipping lines have signed contracts
with Thamesport, but MTS is still thought to have made an operating loss
last year.
Phase 3 of the development, planned as a bulk cargo terminal and to be under
construction by this year, is likely to be delayed because of low
throughputs. The company had hoped to use the terminal for coal imports, but
said yesterday it may now be switched to container use.
MTS was a 1989 management buy-out from Mr Peter de Savary's Thames Estuary
Terminals. Institutions, led by County NatWest Ventures and Legal &amp; General,
hold about 80 per cent of the share capital.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Midland strengthens profits to Pounds 178m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND Bank, which was taken over by HSBC Holdings last year, yesterday
disclosed a strong rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 178m for 1992 against
Pounds 36m for the previous year. Provisions for bad debts fell to Pounds
676m, against Pounds 903m.
Midland's capital ratio strengthened to 10.7 per cent on the retention of
Pounds 102m after tax and an extraordinary gain of Pounds 26m from the sale
of its Thomas Cook travel agent subsidiary. It did not make a dividend
payment to HSBC last year.
It will add Pounds 242m to HSBC's 1992 profits. This comprises Pounds 89m of
pre-tax profits and Pounds 122m of restructuring costs and a Pounds 31m
permanent diminution in property values which it took as losses, but which
will be charged against HSBC reserves.
The commercial banking division made profits of Pounds 138m against a Pounds
50m loss last year. Its provisions fell 31 per cent to Pounds 557m, although
those on UK corporate and personal loans rose to Pounds 336m in the second
half against Pounds 306m in the first.
The merchant banking division, which includes the Samuel Montagu and
Greenwell Montague stockbrokers businesses, incurred a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 33m (from Pounds 34m profit). This was due to a bad debt charge of
Pounds 77m, created by a few problem accounts.
Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive, said the bank was starting to see
'glimmers of light' from increased economic activity. Midland would gain
from HSBC's strong capital, he said, and from being able to offer corporate
customers access to services such as treasury operations and trade finance
in which it had joined forces with HSBC.
Midland's Firstdirect telephone banking subsidiary did not achieve an
operating profit, because of a high level of spending on advertising. Mr
Pearse said he expected the business to enter operating profit this year.
Overseas commercial banking operations recorded a loss before exceptional
items of Pounds 6m (down from a Pounds 38m profit). Operating income from
overseas offices fell 14 per cent to Pounds 277m and there were losses in
France and Italy.
Profits from foreign exchange trading increased by Pounds 67m helped by
volatility following Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism. Mr
Pearse said this was mostly from commission, although the bank had limited
positions.
Following a property revaluation, the bank charged a Pounds 31m permanent
diminution in value to its profit and loss account, and charged to reserves
a remaining revaluation of Pounds 99m.
The tier 1 ratio strengthened to 5.7 per cent, while the total risk asset
ratio rose to 10.7 per cent (from 10.3 per cent). Total assets rose to
Pounds 61.3bn (from Pounds 59.8bn) and risk-weighted assets rose slightly to
Pounds 41.9bn.
Total operating income excluding Thomas Cook's contribution fell marginally
to Pounds 2.96bn (from Pounds 2.97bn), while total operating expenses fell
to Pounds 2.03bn (from Pounds 2.04bn) and the cost-to-income ratio remained
at 68.6 per cent.
HSBC's 75p ordinary shares closed 23p up at 624p.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UB sells Terry's chocolates to Kraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KRAFT General Foods International, part of Philip Morris, the large US
tobacco and foods group, is to buy Terry's, United Biscuits' chocolates
division, for Pounds 220m in cash.
The deal marks the first serious entry into the UK chocolate market by KGFI,
which owns Jacobs Suchard, a leading Swiss chocolate maker, and recently
made a successful Dollars 1.5bn bid for Freia Marabou, Norway's biggest
confectionery company.
UB said the sale represented an excellent deal. Its share price fell 14p to
close at 379p. Analysts attributed the fall mainly to a technical correction
after a strong rally in recent days.
UB expects the sale to enhance its full-year earnings and cut gearing,
excluding intangibles, to about 50 per cent from more than 90 per cent. It
would yield an exceptional profit of about Pounds 75m in this year's
accounts, after a Pounds 33m charge for goodwill previously written off to
reserves. There would be no significant tax liability.
Terry's earned trading profits of Pounds 14.3m on sales of Pounds 153m in
1991, when its net assets were Pounds 84m. It has about 3 per cent by volume
of the chocolate market in Britain, where it owns two factories, and has
subsidiaries in France, Italy and the US.
KGFI said the acquisition would give Suchard its own distribution network in
the UK, where it has only about 1 per cent of a chocolate market dominated
by Cadbury Schweppes, Nestle and Mars. Suchard's brands include Toblerone,
Milka and Cote d'Or.
KGFI said Terry's had a good stable of brands, sales of which could be
further expanded, in Britain and internationally. It planned to retain
Terry's existing management and allow it to continue developing the business
along recent lines.
Mr Jack Keenan, KGFI's chairman, said Suchard was unlikely ever to have a
large share of the UK market. But Terry's was the only acquisition candidate
available and offered a profitable niche and a product range that
complemented Suchard's own.
UB said the sale would provide UB with increased flexibility in its biscuit
and savoury snack operations. The deal leaves Cadbury as the only large
UK-owned chocolate maker.

FT  04 MAR 93 / In search of niches for household appliances: Andrew Baxter
on the aftermath to merger mania in the European white goods market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decade of mergers and rationalisation has changed the face of the European
white goods industry that produces washing machines, fridges, dishwashers,
cookers and ovens. In 1970, 400 companies had 80 per cent of the European
market, but by 1980, the number had fallen to 150, and 10 years later was
whittled down to just 15.
Perhaps six or eight producers will soon have 80 per cent of the market,
says Mr Vittorio Merloni, chairman of Merloni Elettrodomestici, best known
for its Ariston and Indesit brands. Whatever happens, the sharpest
concentration in the industry has passed.
Judging by the mood of the remaining smaller companies at last month's
Domotechnica appliance fair in Cologne, they are determined to keep it that
way. The Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10.5bn) European white goods market may never
resemble its US counterpart, which is dominated by four domestic groups.
The conventional view has always been that the leading companies -
Electrolux with 20 to 25 per cent of the market, the Bosch Siemens joint
venture (15 to 19 per cent), Whirlpool Europe (11 to 15 per cent) and
Merloni (about 10 per cent) will squeeze the minnows further in the 1990s.
The big companies were formed in the merger mania of the 1980s, and in
anticipation of the single market. The process has now slowed - the only big
acquisition last year saw Elettrofinanziaria (Elfi), the Italian electronics
concern, buy France's Thomson Electromenager to put it on an equal footing
with Merloni.
Last year the big companies increased their market shares marginally. Their
pan-European brands are now in place and are backed up by synergies in
manufacturing and component purchasing. But the smaller companies have
strategies to help them prosper. For one thing, the single market is not as
homogeneous as was predicted five years ago and big regional differences
remain, particularly in cookers.
Fast-growing producers from countries close to the European markets - such
as Arcelik, the Turkish supplier - are exporting value-for-money machines.
Even Zagreb-based Koncar Elektroindustrie is trying to increase exports to
offset the contraction of its home market - once Yugoslavia, now Croatia.
Some smaller producers operate independently within a larger umbrella
company. Blomberg, Germany's smallest white goods producer, has prospered as
a mainly domestic supplier, but is also part of the Elfi group.
After a decade of strong sales growth, the market has gone off the boil.
Sales for the seven main types of machines, excluding microwaves, reached
42.6m units in 1991, slipped to 42.3m last year and are expected to edge
downwards again this year.
Even the microwave market - dominated by Japanese and Korean suppliers  -
has cooled off, with sales last year of 7.3m units compared with a 1988 peak
of 7.84m. Short-term factors such as the collapse of the UK housing market
have played their part.
But there are more deep-seated problems for producers: the white goods
market is relatively mature, apart from dishwashers and microwaves;
consumers tend to run their machines until they fall apart; and ecological
pressures on the industry - notably for the removal of CFCs from
refrigerators - are pushing up development costs.
The current market picture across Europe looks mixed. The UK market fell 20
per cent from 1988 to 1991, but declined only slightly last year. There is
cautious optimism as signs of life return to the housing sector. The Spanish
and French markets also fell last year, by about 2 per cent and 3 per cent
respectively, while the Italian market was more or less stable.
The one bright spot in Europe over the past three years has been Germany,
where unit sales, excluding microwaves, have grown by an average 8 per cent
a year.
Reunification has spurred a growing demand for large appliances in the new
German states. And in western Germany, energy-saving features have prompted
increasing replacement purchases.
But the outlook is different this year in Germany - the ZVEI appliances and
electronics association says the subdued mood, price increases and the fear
of unemployment are likely to cause a decline in demand for appliances.
Mr Leif Johansson, Electrolux president, sees three scenarios for the
European market in 1993.
The best case, he says, would see quick reductions in interest rates as
Germany realises it is in recession: the worst case envisages continuing
unemployment and higher than expected interest rates, along with new
disappointments on the Maastricht treaty.
The most realistic scenario is in between, suggesting a fall of about 3 per
cent in the white goods market.
Whatever happens after 1993, producers have two paths to expanding in a
mature market. The first is to take market share from each other. The second
is to be well-positioned to exploit the remaining growth opportunities, such
as the embryonic dishwasher market in eastern Germany.
Whirlpool Europe's recent performance - a 6 per cent rise in sales to
Dollars 2.4bn and record operating earnings, in spite of lower shipments -
shows how the benefits of a global strategy help the large companies on both
counts. But the smaller producers' cycle is still spinning.

FT  04 MAR 93 / GRE back in the black at Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARDIAN ROYAL Exchange, one of the largest composite insurers, yesterday
surprised the markets by announcing pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m for 1992,
compared with a Pounds 210m loss in 1991.
The company, which has benefited from rises in premium rates and milder
weather in the UK, is the second big insurance company to move back into the
black this year, after two years of severe trading losses.
However its maintained dividend of 7p dampened investors' enthusiasm. The
shares closed only 1p higher at 189p.
Mr Sid Hopkins, chief executive, said the dividend move had helped
strengthen the balance sheet.
Analysts had expected losses of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 40m, but said
fourth-quarter trading figures and investment returns were better than
expected.
Like competitors who have already reported better figures for 1992, GRE's
improvement was underpinned by a turnround in the UK, where underwriting
losses fell to Pounds 170m compared with Pounds 332m in 1991.
Mr Hopkins said that the group was benefiting from 'extremely harsh rate
increases' and its decision to 'cull' bad business.
UK motor losses fell to Pounds 17m from Pounds 66m, after price increases
last year of more than 25 per cent. Overall UK premium income fell to Pounds
943m from Pounds 950m. The group had reduced the number of motorists it
insures by 100,000 to 517,000.
It had also benefited from a 2 per cent fall in the frequency of motor
claims. About 28 per cent insured by GRE made claims last year, compared
with 30 per cent in 1991. Worldwide non-life premiums grew marginally to
Pounds 2.24bn from Pounds 2.2bn, with life premiums falling to Pounds 821m
from Pounds 879m.
Underwriting losses of Pounds 314m (against Pounds 491m) were more than
offset by life profits of Pounds 21m (down from Pounds 23m) and investment
income of Pounds 296m (up from Pounds 268m).
The solvency margin - which measures net assets as a percentage of non-life
premium income - climbed to 51 per cent at the end of 1992, compared with 43
per cent at the end of 1991.
Mr Hopkins said GRE was continuing to review its smaller operations, but
'selective expansion' was possible.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Zil heads for the capitalist road

ZIL, the Russian industrial conglomerate indelibly associated with the black
limousines of the former Soviet Union's top communists (pictured above,
transporting president Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991 on his last visit to the
UK), is to be sold off.
The government said yesterday that R1bn of nominal share capital - 1m shares
with a face value of R1,000 - will be offered for sale at 100 auction
centres across Russia.
Although Zil limousines are still used to whisk president Boris Yeltsin and
his bodyguards at high speeds through the Moscow traffic, demand has fallen
now that the new commercial elite prefer Mercedes and stretch Volvos. Zil
also produces heavy trucks of an outmoded design and refrigerators.
The cars are handmade at a rate of two or three a year, but the mode of
production guaranteed that parts were not interchangeable. A company
official declined to reveal the price.
The cars are still popular with well-heeled tourists. They are also bought
by smart young Russian bankers to conduct them from work to marble-floored
dachas. The armour plating and curtained seclusion of the passenger saloons,
which shielded the communist elite from terrorists and stares of the
curious, now serve the same function for the new commercial princes.
Western consulting companies which have studied the enterprise concluded
that the task of transforming the company into a successful and profitable
enterprise will be huge. It has between between 110,000 and 130,000 workers
in 17 sites across Russia.
The widely spread sites, wasteful production methods and archaic designs
lend a Stalinist splendour, but make Zil a nightmare for rationalisation and
privatisation.
The shares offered represent 35 per cent of the share value of the company,
with 40 per cent going to the workforce and management free or on
preferential terms and a further 25 per cent held by the state for sale
later.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Clark will not be prosecuted over arms-to-Iraq evidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN CLARK, the former defence minister, will not be prosecuted over
evidence he gave to the Matrix Churchill trial at the Old Bailey in
November, the Crown Prosecution Service announced yesterday.
The announcement led to accusations last night by Mr Robin Cook, Labour's
trade and industry spokesman, that the government had deliberately
engineered the decision because it was afraid Mr Clark would have revealed
more details of ministerial involvement in the affair.
He said: 'Alan Clark knows a lot about ministers' involvement in the
arms-to-Iraq scandal. The government appears to have backed off from
prosecution because they were scared that he might have continued to tell
the truth in the court room.'
The Matrix Churchill affair provoked a political storm last November with Mr
John Major forced to defend the government against accusations that
ministers had misled the Commons. The outcry led to the setting up of an
inquiry into trade with Iraq headed by Lord Justice Scott.
Three former Matrix Churchill executives were cleared of illegally exporting
military related goods to Iraq.
The Pounds 3m trial collapsed when the prosecution said Mr Clark's evidence
in court had not been consistent with earlier statements to the Customs and
Excise.
Scotland Yard was asked to investigate apparent inconsistences in Mr Clark's
evidence but the CPS said yesterday the police had been 'unable to establish
with sufficient certainty which of the inconsistent statements made by Mr
Clark was not true'.
Mr Clark said he had not at any stage been interviewed by police after the
trial. When it was suggested that this might seem surprising, given that an
investigation was being held, he said: 'I would agree with you.'
Asked why Mr Clarke had not been interviewed, Scotland Yard said:
'Presumably it wasn't considered necessary.'
During the trial Mr Clark told the court he had advised Matrix Churchill
executives to be 'economical with the actualite' by agreeing a specification
which emphasised the peaceful use of machine tools which they wanted to
export to Iraq. Trade sanctions against Iraq prevented exports intended for
military use.
In his evidence Mr Clark described the trade sanctions guidelines as
'tiresome and intrusive' and suggested they were intended to ban only
weapons of mass destruction. He said the sanctions were deliberately elastic
and could be the subject of 'interpretation and argument'.
Mr Paul Henderson, Matrix Churchill's former managing director and one of
those acquitted at the trail, said he was not surprised by the CPS decision.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Bosnia Moslems sign pact at UN: Military disengagement
accord maps out withdrawal of forces and weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS attempts to negotiate a peace settlement between the warring
parties in Bosnia moved a step forward last night when the Moslem government
followed Bosnian Serbs and Croats in signing an agreement on military
disengagement.
The accord, which will not take effect until all sides agree on a division
of Bosnia, maps out how forces and weapons would be withdrawn under UN
control after a final settlement.
Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the UN and EC mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen, said that, along with constitutional proposals agreed in Geneva,
two of the three main elements of the peace package were now agreed.
But he stopped short of calling the signing a breakthrough and warned that a
lot of tough bargaining was still ahead. While the decision to sign by
President Alija Izetbegovic had restored momentum to the peace process, a
lot of 'muscle' would still have to be applied by governments to push the
parties to a final accord.
The constitutional proposals provide for maintaining Bosnia-Hercegovina as a
single state divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. It is disagreement
on their frontiers that remains the stumbling block to an overall settlement
 -without which the military disengagement accord remains a dead letter.
The Moslems previously withheld agreement on disengagement partly because of
the lack of firm guarantees on control of heavy weapons. Perhaps 40,000 UN
soldiers, a larger force than originally calculated, may be needed to
maintain peace and take control of heavy armaments.
Mr Eckhard indicated that President Bill Clinton's decision to commit US
ground troops might have influenced the Bosnian president's change of heart.
In response to a US request, UN Security Council members last night held
consultations over Serb attacks on Cerska, eastern Bosnia, and called a
meeting for early today at which a statement was expected calling for an end
to the fighting.
Earlier, President Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of
state, said the air-drops of relief supplies into eastern Bosnia would
continue.
On Tuesday night, Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, had given the
impression that the air-drops, which he described as 'symbolic' and 'a great
success', would be suspended indefinitely. But Mr Christopher said there was
'no evidence at all' that the air-drops had prompted greater Serb assaults
on the Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia. He added that in view of the
'disturbing' reports of greater fighting and refugee flows 'the air drops
will be continuing'.
The renewed US commitment to the air-drops appears much influenced by
Tuesday's announcement that Russia was willing to join the US airborne aid
efforts. The US Air Force said yesterday the US European Command would be
sending a five-person team to Moscow.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market's response to UB's sale of its Terry's chocolate business looked
churlish. In truth, the 3 per cent drop in UB's shares may have signified
little more than profit-taking after a recent flurry. The deal certainly
seems shrewd for UB, which has built Terry's into an attractive chocolate
business over the past decade. But with just 3 per cent of the UK market, it
was a small player facing sticky growth prospects. The exit multiple of
almost 23 was tempting. The Pounds 220m proceeds will help reduce UB's
gearing to about 50 per cent. It will also give UB flexibility in competing
for Royal Brands' biscuit business in Spain.
What Terry's buyer, Philip Morris, hopes to achieve is most intriguing. Its
ownership of Jacobs Suchard and its torrential cash flow suggest it could
become a formidable competitor in the UK chocolate market, should it so
desire. That would be unsettling for Cadbury Schweppes.

BICC's management must rue the day it ever ventured into property
development. The rubble of another Pounds 35m of exceptional property
provisions and a Pounds 12m property trading loss has concealed an otherwise
pugnacious performance.
The Balfour Beatty contracting arm showed remarkable resilience by
increasing profits 5 per cent. The cables business suffered more but should
now benefit from the revival in the US and Australian economies. The
recovery appeal of these businesses has recently pierced the gloom
enveloping BICC's property activities and its shares have climbed by
two-thirds since October. There may be a little way left to run with the
company still yielding some 7 per cent. But last year's dividend again had
to be funded from reserves. It will take a while yet to rebuild cover
sufficiently to justify raising the pay-out, especially if property throws
up any more grisly surprises.

FT  04 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Midland Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Midland Bank looks more comfortable now that the merger with HSBC is
complete. It no longer has to worry about capital; the restructuring of the
UK branch network is largely accomplished; and, since it provided early
against losses, it should benefit sooner than other banks from declining
provisions. There may not be much more room to cut costs, but, as long as
Midland continues to keep them under control, any extra business which
recovery brings should yield productivity gains which will help raise
operating income.
That, at least, is the theory. The question is whether Midland can deliver.
The merger will certainly help bring new business in areas such as trade
finance and treasury. HSBC's information technology will give Midland a
competitive edge in branch banking. But the other message from its annual
results is that conditions are still pretty difficult in the market place.
UK provisions actually rose during the second half. Trading profit was
helped by higher treasury earnings since sterling's devaluation, as well as
by Midland's hedged interest rate position which allowed it to benefit from
lower UK rates. Both will contribute in 1993. Neither will compensate
indefinitely for lack of loan volume.

FT  04 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: GRE
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The retrenchment at Guardian Royal Exchange is finally paying off. A small
pre-tax profit and a dividend unchanged from the reduced level set last year
is meagre reward after the best part of a decade of underperformance. But
GRE deserves credit for playing itself back into the game. Like others in
the sector, it can thank favourable exchange rates for supporting its
balance sheet. But the year-end solvency ratio of 51 per cent is also the
result of hard graft, shedding business and conserving capital.
Whether it can make the best of this restored position is another matter.
Expanding in the UK makes sense while premiums are rising, but the strategy
is by no means unique. The commitment of new capital to the market will
doubtless lead to softer rates. GRE may arrive too late to pick up the best
of the business. Having expanded at the wrong time in the late 1980s, it
will have to demonstrate sharper underwriting skills this time around the
cycle.
By doing nothing, though, GRE would risk losing touch with its competitors.
Since its exposure to mortgage indemnity insurance is limited, there is an
opportunity to make up lost ground. Trading at a small premium to net asset
value - once the embedded value of the life operation is included - the
shares arguably look cheap. But GRE can only add value to these assets if it
picks the right risks.

FT  04 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Great expectations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The London equity market's surge to new highs seems a knee-jerk response to
renewed hopes of lower German interest rates and the rebound on Wall Street.
Yet investors may be a touch too optimistic about the course of UK monetary
policy. If one assumes that the chancellor is trying to rebuild his
credibility, then his recent statements preclude an interest rate cut for
some time. The Bank of England's clear hints that rates are low enough have
boxed Mr Lamont in further. So any cut in Germany may not be followed in the
UK. That would force sterling higher, weakening export prospects.
Besides, the timing of German rate cuts is finely balanced. To distance
itself from last weekend's G7 meeting, the Bundesbank may not cut rates this
morning. Waiting until the next council meeting on the March 18 would leave
the cut uncomfortably close to the French elections. Nor is it certain that
any cut would be rapidly followed by others, given the uncertain German
inflation outlook.
Meanwhile, the British results season is proving no better than the rather
poor advance expectations, and demands for rights issue money are likely to
continue. While the Budget may not produce an interest rate cut, some fiscal
tightening seems likely, with rumblings of more aggressive tax increases to
come. The chancellor may try to surprise - and for once please - the markets
with a PSBR total substantially lower than general expectations. That is
thin support for an equity market facing a sluggish and patchy economic
recovery.

FT  04 MAR 93 / US urges talks on latest Serb attacks: Christopher denies
air drops linked to renewed fighting in eastern Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state,
yesterday said the air drops of relief supplies into eastern Bosnia would
continue.
The US also called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security
Council to consider the latest Serb attacks on Cerska, eastern Bosnia.
Council members were due to go into closed session last night to discuss the
crisis, which dashed hopes for progress in a new round of peace talks begun
on Monday by the UN and European Community mediators.
On Tuesday night, Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, had given the
impression that the air drops, which he described as 'symbolic' and 'a great
success', would be suspended indefinitely.
But Mr Christopher said there was 'no evidence at all' that the air drops
had prompted greater Serb assaults on the Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia.
He added that in view of the 'disturbing' reports of greater fighting and
refugee flows 'the air drops will be continuing'.
A ham radio operator from Konjevic Polje, about 11km south of Cerska, which
was the third target of the US air drop, yesterday said villagers had found
18 aid pallets in snow about half a metre deep. Sarajevo radio said heavy
Serb artillery fire made it impossible to conduct a wider search of the
rugged terrain.
At least 18 people were yesterday reported killed and dozens wounded in
Cerska, as thousands of refugees tried to flee the Serb advance through the
region.
'We have reports that Konjevic Polje is under heavy bombardment by Serbs . .
. and on amateur radio we hear they are coming under tear gas, shells, and
small arms fire', said Ms Lyndall Sachs, spokeswoman of the Belgrade office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Foreign secretary Mr Douglas Hurd discussed the situation with the
mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, yesterday in a visit to New York
that took on enhanced significance because of the worsening situation. He
also met Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali and endorsed the UN secretary-general's
views on the need for the use of force by UN troops to implement any
agreement.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, in a letter to President
Clinton, urged the US to abandon the air drops, because they threatened to
ignite a wider war. A Serb mayor in eastern Bosnia also urged the US to stop
the drops, saying land corridors were safer and more efficient.
The renewed US commitment to the air drops appears much influenced by
Tuesday's announcement in Moscow that Russia was willing to join the US
airborne relief efforts. A US air force spokesman yesterday said the US
European Command would be sending a person team to Moscow to discuss
details.

Members of the New York Mercantile Exchange had been looking forward to
getting tanked up at this evening's 10th anniversary gala in the
Waldorf-Astoria.
Deservedly so, too, since crude oil futures now trade almost as much in a
day as they did in a whole year at the start, and the exchange sets world
prices for natural gas and other energy products as well as crude oil
products.
Alas, a pall has been cast over the proceedings by the bomb at the World
Trade Centre, which crippled the trading floor. Although Nymex has kept open
for a short working day throughout this week, traders have been growing
unusually hot under the collar with the air-conditioning yet to be restored.
Meanwhile chairman Lou Guttman, working round the clock, has had to abandon
active campaigning for the mid-March election in which he has been hoping to
secure a third term.
Already fighting federal charges that he violated commodity trading
regulations in 1989, he must be re-reading Murphy's law.

The menu for today includes nine freshly grilled humans, candidates for one
of the top jobs in British journalism: the editorship of the 150-year-old
weekly, The Economist.
Each will be given an interview - or viva voce in the language of the media
branch of the Oxford University mafia - by a committee composed of
troubleshooter-extraordinary Sir John Harvey-Jones, Cadbury Schweppes's
Dominic Cadbury, and Frank Barlow, chief operating officer of Pearson,
owners of the Financial Times.
The procedure will be straightforward. Starting promptly at 9am and in
alphabetical order, the nine will have half an hour apiece to state their
claims. Even so, Oxonians' habit of reverting to their old varsity jargon
has already led to a misunderstanding about the salary on offer.
One Oxford man involved was overheard telling a companion that getting the
job would involve 'a terrifying lot of vivas'.
'But surely it won't all be paid in fivers,' came the reply.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The phrase 'marriage of convenience' has been given distinctly earthy
overtones by a report from the North Brabant Christian Farmers' Union on the
reasons behind the weddings of 200 pig farmers over the past five years.
It seems they married not for money, but for manure.
With more pigs than people in the Netherlands, the authorities are worried
that the animals' excretions will outweigh the absorbent capacity of the
soil, endangering water supplies. So quota restrictions have been imposed on
the amount of dung the farms may produce.
The effect - since quota rights can be acquired by inheritance - is a
bullish marriage market for farmers' daughters as their hands are sought by
other farmers wanting to boost their manure allowance.

the telephone to his four biggest shareholders arguing that he was not
cocking a snook at the Cadbury recommendations. 'Three said fine; one
thought it a pity. But that was a Scottish institution, so they are more
remote.' Aha.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Observer: Sir Bryan gets the call
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the first big jobs of any new president of the CBI is to find his
successor, so its Centre Point headquarters yesterday emitted a puff of
white smoke signifying that former Post Office chairman Sir Bryan Nicholson
is being groomed as the senior voice of British industry and commerce at
home and abroad.
It will be another 15 months before the current president, ex-Unilever boss
Sir Michael Angus, steps down. But the CBI is rather like civil service
departments in the matter of planning succession. Clearly, Sir Bryan has
proved his mettle in its committees and is being prepared for permanent
membership of the great and the good.
Despite present unemployment levels, finding the right man for the job is
less easy than it may sound. It's a two-year unpaid post, involving at least
two days' work a week. True, it has perks such as a chance to hobnob with
the prime minister and pontificate about what's wrong with Britain. But it's
not a job suited to a chief executive who is trying to run a business
full-time.
Both Angus and his predecessor Sir Brian Corby of the Pru were at the end of
their executive careers when they got the call, and Nicholson has just given
up running the Post Office. He looks as good a choice as any, although the
CBI won't say whether it tried to sign up others such as Guinness's Sir
Anthony Tennant, or Shell's Sir Peter Holmes.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Derivatives - a delicate balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derivatives trading has become the most significant growth area in financial
services. BlS estimates of amounts outstanding in important exchange-traded
and over-the-counter contracts show growth from some Dollars 1,000bn five
years ago to Dollars 8,000bn at the end of 1991.
These figures give an exaggerated impression. Credit exposure in any
contract at any time is only a small proportion of the nominal amount. We
cannot be complacent, however, in the face of the great weight of these
markets. Chief market participants include banks, whose earlier credit
judgments led to over-commitment to sovereign debt and then to highly geared
or over-concentrated domestic lending. The intermeshing of markets exposes
the system to risk of cross-infection and mishap on a larger scale than
ever.
Conversely, these markets have brought benefits in an uncertain environment,
enabling investors and corporate treasurers to identify risks to which they
are ready to be exposed and to take insurance cover where they are not.
Derivatives do not add risks to the system. They provide the ability to
identify, price and transfer existing risks.
A balanced approach to regulation is needed, neither cramping the energy and
innovation of these markets, nor tolerating inadequate standards or risk.
Five principles of a viable approach might be these:
Initiative on an international basis. The flexibility and mobility of
derivatives trading mean that the possibilities for regulatory arbitrage, if
playing fields are not level, are enormous. Development of regulation should
be collaborative and international, building on the work of the BIS, Iosco
and the Group of 30. The first requirement is for a shared understanding of
problems.
Practitioners must be involved. The complexity of modern financial and
derivative markets means that no regulator can be confident of sufficient
understanding without practitioner input. It was partly the inflexibility
and inadequacy of some national regulation which drove substantial
derivatives business off-exchange, off-shore and off-balance sheet. Concern
at the risk of regulatory capture is insignificant compared with the need
for the best market knowledge practitioners can contribute. The work of
senior market practitioners in the Group of 30, led by Sir Dennis
Weatherstone, and the efforts of the International Swap Dealers' Association
in establishing standard contracts are welcome.
As derivatives contracts provide an efficient, flexible means of covering
against specific forms of market risk, the focus should be on credit or
counterparty risk. The preference of some exchanges to push all derivatives
business into exchange-traded contracts should be resisted, as the
flexibility of OTC contracts has greatly benefited market participants. The
greater the determination to leave the customising capability of the OTC
markets undisturbed, the greater the priority of enhancing legal certainty
in the netting of transactions, thus shrinking the outstanding counterparty
or credit exposure in the market. The aim should be to give some regulatory
acknowledgement to netting through appropriate structuring of capital
requirements, akin to the inducements provided by securities regulators to
diversification of liquid equity portfolios.
There is need for improvement in reporting and disclosure standards to
promote understanding among market practitioners of the complex risks they
are undertaking, above all in writing options. Importance should be attached
to the establishment of credit assessment and audit arrangements separately
from the trading desk.
National regulators should question and even curtail the operations of
entities in their sphere of responsibility where there are doubts.
Henry Kaufman has argued that these issues cannot be dealt with without a
dedicated institutional capability, and that a new international institution
should be established.
On the other hand, this business is concentrated in the financial centres of
the G7 countries. There is need for promoting adequate regulatory initiative
and convergence among these countries before concluding that there is need
for a new international bureaucracy. A high-level international oversight
group may eventually be necessary.
The author is deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank and former chairman of the
Securities and Investment Board.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Polluted land
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has shelved its original proposals for a register of
contaminated land, as Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, is
likely to confirm soon. The motives behind the proposals were sound - the
recognition that contamination by metals and industrial chemicals can damage
health, and that more information about the risks should be available.
However, the scheme threatened to be overambitious and unworkable, so a new
approach is in order.
The original plans, framed in the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, have
come under fierce attack during two stormy public consultations. As most
recently proposed, the register would have included all land known to have
been used by one of several types of heavy industry, regardless of whether
it was actually contaminated. Suggestions for a survey of actual
contamination were rejected because of the financial burden such an exercise
would have placed on many local authorities.
The register's critics - mainly builders and lenders - complained that it
threatened to blight property values across much of the country, including
perhaps a third of the Midlands. Leading banks also warned that the register
could inhibit commercial development. They were wary of taking potentially
contaminated land as security for loans, because of the risk of a fall in
value or huge clean-up costs.
The question is what should now replace the proposals. The alternative which
Mr Howard is most likely to announce is for a register built up gradually by
recording contamination when land changes hands. Under this proposal, which
is backed by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, the seller of the
property would be responsible for demonstrating that the land under offer
was clean.
That solution is workable, but it does not address the problem of assessing
the risk to people working or living on contaminated land that is not
changing hands. One answer would be to press councils to survey at least the
land that is most likely to be contaminated, in order to bring the worst
risks to light. This approach would be less ambitious than the original
proposals, but would represent a clear move in the right direction.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Disillusion after golden decade: As unemployment and
bankruptcies grow, the mood in Spain is turning against Gonzalez
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just four months ago, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was musing that
the election this year would be his last and that he would retire from
office gracefully. Now he may not have that choice. The mood of the country
is turning against him and, for the first time, there are doubts about how
long he will remain in the Moncloa palace, his official residence.
An emergency debate on rocketing unemployment in the Cortes, Spain's
parliament, on Tuesday turned into a litany of accusations against him, and
almost unanimous insistence from the opposition that he call an election
immediately. He will not, but as recession deepens and there is little sign
of economic recovery, Mr Gonzalez and Spain are in more trouble than they
have been for a decade.
Just over 10 years ago, in opposition, Mr Gonzalez was hurling insults
across the Cortes debating chamber. The government was crumbling, riven by
internal dissent and incapable of responding to the growing economic crisis.
He was merciless. 'I would be ashamed to be running a country with 2m
unemployed,' he is reported to have said a few months before winning his
first term in office in 1982.
He may feel differently now, however. Spain does not have 2m unemployed; it
has more than 3m. With an election due before the end of November, Mr
Gonzalez's Spanish Socialist Workers party is united only by its fear of
defeat.
The government's own polls show it losing 20 seats and, thus, its
parliamentary majority. The latest polls were taken in November, three
months before the National Statistics Institute revealed a record 3.05m
Spaniards out of work. The figure was more than half a million more than the
Gonzalez government had predicted at the beginning of the year. The
government had also failed to deliver on its 1989 promise to create 1.2m
jobs during this four-year legislature.
As the economic outlook grows bleaker, Mr Gonzalez must be pondering the
mistakes of his third term in office. He dithered for two years before
starting the deregulation of Spanish industry, and making it easier to hire
and fire workers. Even now, little deregulation has been undertaken and
labour market reforms are stalled.
In the past 12 months, he has hurried to recover lost ground and stumbled in
the process. He has tried to equip Spain for European economic and monetary
union by meeting the tough convergence criteria of the Maastricht treaty. He
has cut unemployment benefits, and wanted to reduce income tax. But as the
1992 budget deficit doubled over the previous year to a trillion pesetas, he
had to abandon tax cuts in order to finance spiralling government debt.
Speculation last autumn against currencies in the exchange rate mechanism
led Spain into two devaluations to prevent an overvalued peseta from being
forced to exit from the system. It has lost 16 per cent of its value against
the D-Mark since last summer.
Mr Gonzalez, long viewed as pragmatic for his market-oriented policies, is
increasingly seen as dogmatic. His own party is criticising him for risking
electoral defeat by not raising public spending, cutting interest rates or
further devaluing the peseta - moves he says would threaten EC economic
convergence.
'He is either being strangely principled for a politician or he has just run
out of ideas,' says a leading businessman. But while the business community
has turned against the government, its attacks on Mr Gonzalez are being led
by the employers' umbrella body, the CEOE, and not by individuals.
This is because there remains a possibility that the prime minister will
form the next government. He still has some powerful cards to play to
different audiences. His apparently tight fiscal stance is aimed at
convincing the foreign financial institutions that trade in Spain's currency
and debt that speculation against the peseta will be firmly resisted. But at
home, the 1993 budget allows him some leeway. Spending is up by 9.3 per cent
over last year's target while the economy is forecast to grow by less than 1
per cent.
On the timing of the election, Mr Gonzalez also has the upper hand. He can
wait until the end of November if he chooses. By then, Spain's inflation
rate, now at an annual 5.4 per cent, should have slowed because of the
recession and interest rates should have slipped below their current 13 per
cent.
Such developments might not make an immediate difference to employment, but
the prime minister knows how to capitalise on even a little good news. Mr
Gonzalez and and his finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, are a formidable
duo. Faced with mounting calls for action on unemployment, the two last week
quickly assembled a Pta300bn (Pounds 1.76bn) emergency plan to slow job
losses by lengthening temporary job contracts and helping small businesses.
They promised it would be financed mostly by the EC, but the Community has
yet to be asked for the money.
The package was attacked by the opposition in parliament on Tuesday as too
little, too late. There is some merit in that view since the plan is
unlikely to have much impact on the economy before the election, and may not
even be implemented in full. There will probably be other such plans in
coming months as the Socialists' political fortunes ebb.
For Mr Gonzalez the challenge is to keep his most dangerous opponents - the
conservative Partido Popular and the communist-led Izquierda Unida - at bay,
while convincing his own party that power has not slipped away yet. It will
not be easy: the party is split as a result of the economic downturn.
A badly managed attempt to regulate strikes has thrown the Socialists'
disarray into sharp relief in the past few weeks. Business welcomed a tough
draft law presented to parliament by the government last year, but was
shocked last month when a significantly watered-down version was forced
through parliament after 'talks' between the party and the unions.
Mr Jose Mara Cuevas, the CEOE president, called the new law 'a declaration
of war', prompting Mr Gonzalez and Mr Solchaga to promise it would be
tightened up. This pledge angered the party and has done little to appease
the business community, struggling under high interest rates. Receiverships
have reached record levels (see chart).
Galvanised by the government's troubles, Mr Jose Mara Aznar, the young PP
leader, appears convinced he can topple Mr Gonzalez. Before Christmas, polls
put his party just 5 points behind the Socialists. PP officials are
convinced their political outlook has improved since then.
For the first time in a decade, the conservatives have carved out an
economic policy that may succeed in capturing the middle ground. It
comprises a supply-side package of tax cuts, privatisations, elimination of
industrial monopolies and infrastructure investment. Even the unions have
not taken offence.
But these are early days and Mr Aznar could stumble before Spain goes to the
polls. Determined to win, he appeared last year to offer the leadership of
any government he formed to the Catalan regionalists if they joined him.
Last month, eager to capitalise on exchange rate troubles, he suggested that
he would not be opposed to leaving the ERM, thus increasing pressure on the
peseta. Leaving the mechanism is not PP policy.
Overall, Mr Aznar tends to become side-tracked by the PP's political
obsession - accusing the government of corruption. He faces the danger that
the government will encourage the PP into focusing solely on this issue,
something Mr Gonzalez could tackle quickly and efficiently, rather than on
the economy, about which he can do little.
Barring a decisive economic upturn, however, there seems little doubt that
the Socialists will lose their parliamentary majority when Mr Gonzalez holds
the election. It is also unlikely that he would serve another full term
after forming a government. If they contain the loss to no more than 15
seats, they could still form a minority government. If they lose more than
15, they will have to form a coalition, with the Basque or Catalan
regionalists or with the communist IU.
The denouement of this political set-piece promises to be protracted.
Spaniards know that the decade of democratic and economic development under
Mr Gonzalez is drawing to a close. A home he is building in the smart suburb
of Somosaguas, north of Madrid, is, say neighbours, being completed in great
haste. It would be one of his lasting regrets if he were not able to finish
the modernisation of the Spanish economy with the same dispatch.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1.5 per cent limit on public sector pay increases announced last autumn
is beginning to work. Although the bargaining season proper does not start
until April, the government's virtual freeze may stick. The National Health
Service unions have rejected 1.5 per cent, but there is no expectation that
this will lead to strikes. Teachers have been awarded a similar increase, as
have the armed forces. Other public-sector employers, such as British Rail,
the post office and the civil service, know the facts of contemporary pay
bargaining.
More to the point, local authorities are getting the same message. Kent
County Council was the first to announce a 1.5 per cent increase for its
white-collar workers, starting in April. Some 20,000 Sheffield council
employees have voted to accept a 3.25 per cent cut in pay, in exchange for
shorter working hours. The alternative was 1,400 redundancies. The driving
force in this instance was not so much the government's pay ceiling as the
realisation by the Labour-run council that it is obliged to produce a budget
that does not breach the limit set by the Department of the Environment. The
department's principal objective has been to ease the new council tax into
its first year of operation; it has made it clear that it will not hesitate
to cap local budgets where necessary.
Some private companies are proving less resolute than the government.
According to Incomes Data Services, settlement levels fell steadily last
year, in response to lower inflation and the persistent recession. Yet more
than half of the 110 deals recorded in January were for increases of between
3 and 4 per cent. The trend is towards the lower end of that range. The CBI
estimates that in the final quarter of 1992 manufacturing pay awards
averaged 2.8 per cent, while service sector increases averaged 3.2 per cent.
The variations at the extremes are mildly encouraging. The number of freezes
and pay pauses is increasing, and settlements higher than 5 per cent are
reported less often.
If the steady downwards pressure is maintained, the benefits of devaluation
may last. This assumes that the government's freeze is not followed next
year by the sequel to all previous pay freezes - a catch-up explosion.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Last chance in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FAILURE BREEDS failure. In Russia today it even seems predestined. But
despair is an unaffordable luxury, unaffordable for the Russians and
unaffordable for the west as well. Russia is a country of vast resources,
copious skills and great importance. No effort should be spared to prevent
it from sinking into chaos or returning to an inward-looking despotism. It
is this thought, not fear of failure or worries about relatively small sums,
which should inform the reconsideration of policy towards Russia to which
the Clinton administration is committed.
In any such reconsideration, the administration - indeed the west as a whole
 -needs to ask itself a few fundamental questions: how much does Russian
reform matter? What are the political and economic obstacles to success? And
how can the west improve the chances?
After spending trillions of US dollars in protecting itself against the
alternative, the west should need no persuading of the desirability of a
democratic transformation. Given Russia's location, resources, historic
significance and nuclear armament, few foreign policy goals can rival the
desirability of Russian success.
Why have things been going wrong? Russia's flirtation with hyperinflation
and the continuing collapse in industrial output are not the fruit of 'shock
therapy'. On the contrary, they reflect a failure to impose shock therapy.
The government did liberalise prices, but it inherited the disintegration of
central planning and the breakdown in political and economic relations among
the successor states of the Soviet Union. It also had to suffer an explosive
increase in central bank credit.
It is not the unique properties of the Russian soul which make it so
difficult to introduce the market economy. History is littered with the
reputations of pundits who declared that countries could not manage the
market economy, until, unexpectedly, they did. Russians are as
entrepreneurial as anyone else. Under hyperinflation and grossly inadequate
property rights, however, their entrepreneurship is inevitably revealed in
speculation, black marketeering and gangsterism.
A part of what has made reform so difficult is an economic and political
legacy more adverse even than Poland's. What has also made it difficult,
however, were simple mistakes: Mr Boris Yeltsin's failure to reform the
constitution when he could have done so; the central bank's misunderstanding
of the relationship between monetary policy and inflation; and the west's
refusal to do what was needed to help shift the internal balance of power
towards the reformers.
The principal western interlocutor has been the International Monetary Fund.
Its goal of stabilisation is right. But it is no use standing on the
sidelines, waiting for a coherent government to come forward with an
implementable stabilisation policy. The west had to help the reformers win
their domestic battles. It failed to do so. No wonder the Russians joke that
'they pretend to give us aid and we pretend to reform'.
What does the west need to do? First, it should decide that Dollars 24bn a
year in long-term assistance - a mere 0.2 per cent of its aggregate gross
domestic product - is a price well worth paying for the chances of
successful Russian reform.
Second, authority for negotiating and implementing western assistance should
be given to a small high-level team working directly for the Group of Seven
industrial countries. Third, a substantial amount of long-term assistance -
Dollars 2 1/2 bn-Dollars 3bn, plus debt relief - should be given almost
immediately, in return for some degree of control over the central bank and
the budget.
Fourth, assistance should be provided for balance of payments support; for a
comprehensive and politically effective social safety net; for support for
long-term investment in viable industries; and for small business
development. Finally, all assistance must be conditional, but the conditions
should be neither over-detailed nor excessively unrealistic.
It may already be too late to succeed. But it cannot be too late to try. The
Clinton administration should commit itself to one big push. The question is
not whether it can afford to take the risk. It is whether it can afford not
to.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Endogenous growth - treat with care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An eminent Cambridge economist of yesteryear, Sir Dennis Robertson, once
wrote that if you remained in the same place long enough economic fashion
would eventually catch up with you. But it is still worth glancing at the
most recent phases of the fashion cycle when they are used to rationalise
the latest economic policy shifts.
An instance is the whole group of theories known by the unwieldy name of
'endogenous growth', of which you will hear more. For they have been called
into play in relation to some Clinton policies, above all the investment
credits proposed in the president's fiscal package. These theories are also
cited by the French Commissariat General du Plan, which is still alive and
kicking, but as a source of long-range analyses rather than of immediate
policy.
There is nothing particularly new about the policy thrust of endogenous
growth theory, which is to support government efforts to boost investment.
Such efforts were regarded by many development economists as the key to
growth in the postwar decades; and their critics long ago devised the name
'growthmanship' as a putdown. Nevertheless plans to boost investment or
savings, separately or together, were the mainspring of many development
plans prepared for third-world countries, with disappointing actual results.
In Britain, Reginald Maudling, who was Conservative chancellor from 1962 to
1964, boasted that British investment incentives were superior to any in the
west.
The pendulum later swung against so much emphasis on investment, partly
because of disillusion with its fruits and partly because of greater
emphasis among policymakers on open trade policies, deregulation and the
development of attitudes and skills favourable to growth.
Mainstream economic theory was also called in aid by the sceptics. The
reasserted orthodox view was that the growth of output depended on technical
progress and the growth of the labour force. Investment was necessary to
support this growth; but any attempt to force the pace by installing capital
more quickly would lead to rapidly diminishing returns.
Scepticism about the effects of investment was also supported by more
down-to-earth 'growth accountancy', pioneered by an American economist, E F
Denison. He and his followers found that quantifiable factors such as
investment, or the expansion of the labour force, explained in typical cases
no more than half a country's recorded growth rate. This left a large
residual which could be attributed to technical progress, higher educational
standards, market liberalisation or whatever other factor caught the
analyst's fancy.
The 'endogenous growth' theories are essentially a comeback by the
pro-investment school. The assertion is that capital is the key to growth
after all, and that the true return to investment is much higher than the
market one. The word 'endogenous' was used to suggest that the technical
know-how to support more output and a superior range of products was not
something existing in a vacuum but came out of the investment process.
A survey of the new theories is provided in the autumn 1992 issue of the
Oxford Review of Economic Policy (published by the Oxford University Press).
Many of the contributions are mainly concerned with mathematical
possibilities. An important exception has been the British economist,
Maurice Scott, who in his New View of Economic Growth, first published in
1989 (also by OUP), brought in a good deal of evidence to support his
assertions in an unpretentious way, and which is only belatedly receiving
the attention it has always deserved.
Scott has tabulated his reasons for believing that the return to the
individual investor much understates the true 'social' return from
installing new capital. The first, which is fairly clear-cut, is that part
of the gain is taken away in tax.
But a second and bigger reason is what he calls the 'learning externality'.
By this he means that the benefits of investment by one firm spill over to
benefit others. For instance, innovation in one industry may for a time lead
to abnormally high profits. Even if these are eliminated by competition, the
benefit to the customer of cheaper and superior products remains.
A third discrepancy arises from what is called the 'demand externality'. If
all firms invest more, output and income will grow more quickly, thus
increasing everyone's markets. On plausible assumptions about market
structure, this will increase the returns to the original investment
compared with what would have happened if one firm had invested on its own.
(This 'demand externality' is not the same as the short-term stimulus to
output which comes from interest rate cuts or budget deficits. It is rather
the counterpart of a long-term increase in the economy's productive
potential and therefore in its purchasing power.)
A fourth factor acting in the opposite direction - tending to exaggerate
investment returns - is called 'animal spirits'. This has become a technical
term to describe the tendency of professional management to pursue greater
size and growth beyond the point which would maximise their shareholders'
wealth. It is one distortion making for too much investment and partly
offsets all the other forces making for too little.
Scott has deliberately chosen the postwar golden age for his table, when
there really were such animal spirits. Since the 1973 oil shock, a
negligible amount would have to be allowed for them. But even in the earlier
period, they were not enough to prevent the true estimated social return on
investment from being twice as high as the private one.
The wiser exponents of 'endogenous growth' are very cautious about
recommending a helter-skelter drive to subsidise every kind of investment.
Scott warns about the 'scope for special interest lobby, not to mention
corruption', if attempts were made to discriminate between projects on the
basis of their contribution to growth. He concentrates mainly on the
deterrents to savings in the tax system and on the case for a budget surplus
to increase the national savings total. Even here, however, he is very
cautious about making room for more capital spending unless investment
actually increases to fill the gap, which 'writing in the midst of a bad
depression must be the immediate concern'.
But it would be dishonest of me to stop with these prudential
considerations. Many of the real world influences favouring growth are
ignored by the new theorists. As the introduction to the Oxford Review
remarks, 'government thinking about reforms of the regulatory environment
receives virtually no support'.
Simply looking at the figures, it seems pretty clear that output and
investment rise roughly in the same proportion in most countries at most
times. Investment seems to me a product rather than a cause of the growth
process. Of course, some of the benefits of investment, as of the skilful
use of labour or of other inputs, spill over to others beyond those directly
responsible. This is a fact of economic life with which we can live.
The strongest aspect of the new theory is its opposition to the stark
division between technical progress and investment in the older mainstream
theory, which overlooks the all-important 'learning by doing'. But I am not
convinced that putting all the emphasis on investment is right. Investment
left to itself is just a cost; and I doubt if the key to prosperity is to
throw bricks and mortar, machinery or research laboratories at problems.
Both investment and innovation are parts of a single process of seizing
opportunities. The true link between these factors is surely
entrepreneurship, which is equally ignored by the mainstream classical
theory and its more interventionist challengers.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Letter: Community finance would give fillip to Merseyside
infrastructure and training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JACK STOPFORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It makes for easy copy to categorise Merseyside with Corsica
('Merseyside covets neighbour's lifestyle', February 26), because of the
possibility of the area's receiving Objective One status from the European
Community, but it does not explain the benefits we may see as a consequence.
Per capita income in Merseyside is 79.8 per cent of the EC average;
Corsica's equivalent figure is nearer 40 per cent. Merseyside's problems are
the social consequence of a sophisticated regional economy that has no need
to employ people in the numbers it once did.
Merseyside's main traditional employers - docks and cars - are performing
well. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, Ford and Vauxhall are successful
businesses employing high technology instead of people. Objective One
finance, in the absence of regional policy from Westminster, provides public
funds to stimulate new infrastructure works and training to try to cope with
the displacement of people by capital plant. An expanded Liverpool Airport
would help enormously.
Do we envy Manchester? We envy its clever politicians, whose plans for
Manchester Airport and the Olympics bid have attracted massive public
subsidy without provoking press fury. And we envy the fact that, as the
centre of the north-west's media industry, journalists based there prefer to
castigate Liverpool rather than incur the wrath of friends in Manchester.
The Liverpool business community wishes Manchester Godspeed, but envies the
blind eye its problems enjoy in the media.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Letter: Austria's farmers not so independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPH ULL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am glad that David Richardson ('Touring Europe's green and set-aside
land', March 2) shares my concern about the living standard of farmers in
Austria, especially when the country, in the heart of Europe, becomes a
member of the European Community.
Nevertheless, I stress that Austrian farmers are not so independent as the
article suggested. Most of them are organised in the Raiffeisenverband, an
organisation paying a fixed price for their agricultural products. They are
also supported and protected from foreign competition by the Austrian
government - but that is not really independence.
Austria will be a part of the European common market in the near future, in
which the farmers will face international competition anyway. They should
switch to a more specialised production, combined with a high level of
quality. Austria should be part of the European family, as problems are
solved more easily if you are a member of the family than if you are not.
Finally, I would like to remind Mr Richardson that Austria does not only
consist of farmers, although they are a very important part of the Austrian
population.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Letter: Reviving UK manufacturing by consensus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER LYONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is significant that Mark Radcliffe of the CBI's National
Manufacturing Council, in writing about the decline of manufacturing in the
UK (Letters, March 1), has little to say about those who work in industry.
Yes, the government must play its part. Yes, the 'best people' must be
attracted into industry by spreading best practice. But nothing is said
about those at the sharp end of the decline - the millions who still work in
manufacturing and the millions who have lost their jobs in the last two
recessions.
It is becoming widely acknowledged that we will not solve Britain's
underlying economic problems without a reconstruction of our manufacturing
base. But this will not be achieved by the sort of methods which became the
accepted norm in the last decade. We need a consensus to grow and it needs
to be based on frank and open discussion between the government and all who
work in industry.
To quote Dr Carl Hahn, former chairman of Volkswagen, who spoke at the Royal
Society of Arts in London last week: 'Industry needs informed and
knowledgeable input from those working on the assembly line and shop floor -
and that requires a new approach entirely to attitude, communication, to
education, training and management.'
Those are sentiments which MSF, as a union representing a quarter of a
million skilled and professional employees in manufacturing industry,
heartily applauds.
But how can that new attitude be fostered? Certainly not by management
diktat or by ministerial disdain.
In our industrial strategy document, Manufacturing Matters, to be launched
next week, we call for the Department of Trade and Industry to establish a
manufacturing forum to start the dialogue. It would allow Britain's social
partners to forge a consensus on the causes of decline in manufacturing, the
nature of the remedies and responsibilities for future success.
Can we expect the CBI's National Manufacturing Council to join us in
pressing this proposal?

FT  04 MAR 93 / Letter: Single transferable voting empowers electorate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From E M SYDDIQUE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Gary Titley MEP is correct in writing that the single transferable vote
system strengthens the political 'bosses' (Letters, March 1). Indeed, it
strengthens those who should be the real political bosses - the voters. It
removes the power of political parties to decide the order of lists, as in
some systems of proportional representation, and thus who is elected.
The final result of the 1992 Irish general election was delayed for
technical and legal reasons arising from recounts. But such delays are rare.
With more modern techniques, the counting process could be speeded up.
The members of the Plant Commission may well have misled themselves in
saying the STV system is 'capricious'. Candidates are only excluded when
they have no hope of election. The transfer process carries out precisely
what the voters have instructed on the ballot paper. There is a mathematical
logic to the procedure. The ultimate result in each constituency is what
most voters wanted, and while politicians might not like the outcome, they
must accept it. In every STV result one can see a clear link between the
votes cast and the outcome.
What is more, every MP is accountable to those electing them. STV is a very
sensitive system which gives immense power to the voters, which political
parties might not be happy for them to have. Representing the voters'
interests is surely a quality to be commended in a voting system.
STV in practice is as proportional in party political terms as any party
list system which does not aggregate votes nationally. Contrary to Mr
Titley's view, I would suggest that STV makes for very effective
constituency representation because of the direct accountability of every
MP.
It is telling that the Irish electorate has twice rejected by referendum
attempts to abandon STV. E M Syddique,

The Revolution in Work and Family Life
By Patricia Hewitt
IPPR/Rivers Oram Press, Pounds 9.95, 183 pages
The rapid growth of part-time and flexible work is one of those rare
economic trends that seems to benefit almost everybody. Companies gain more
adaptable, more committed and cheaper workers. Employees gain greater
variety in choosing when and for how long they work, which is especially
useful to the growing number of women workers struggling to combine work and
family responsibilities.
About a quarter of all UK employees are now defined as part-time - meaning
they work fewer than 21 hours a week - and the trend is upwards. The
Institute for Employment Research at Warwick University estimates that by
the year 2000 1.2m full-time jobs in manufacturing and utilities will
disappear and 2m service-sector jobs will be created, about half of which
will be part-time.
The trend may not seem benign to the 3,000 full-time employees at the Burton
and BhS retailing chains who have been told in the past few weeks that their
jobs are being converted into part-time ones. It will be especially bad news
to those workers who are the only breadwinners in a household.
But the large majority of part-time workers are not in that position. They
are most often women (4.6m women compared with 1.1m men) working in
relatively low-paid service-sector jobs and living in households with two
wage-earners - now the most common kind.
It is true that a small number of part-timers would prefer to work
full-time. But, according to surveys by the Equal Opportunities Commission,
most express greater satisfaction with their jobs than full-timers and have
a better record than full-timers on absenteeism and staff turnover. Reduced
costs are an additional attraction for employers. According to one recent
employers' study, part-time workers cost companies 12 per cent less an hour,
on average, than full-time workers.
So where is the catch? According to About Time, the latest work from the
Institute for Public Policy Research by Patricia Hewitt, former press
secretary to Neil Kinnock, the problem is that while only about one in three
employees now works a 40-hour, five-day week, most of the UK's employment
laws and welfare regulations are based on that standard week.
As a result, about half of part-time women workers do not qualify for
employment safeguards such as protection from unfair dismissal. About
one-third of all part-timers earn less than the national insurance threshold
of Pounds 54 a week which means that employees are excluded from
unemployment benefit, sick pay, and maternity pay. Many part-timers are also
excluded from company pension funds and redundancy pay.
Despite these problems, Hewitt approves of the emergence of the part-time
economy because it provides user-friendly working time - especially for
working mothers and people nearing retirement.
She argues in her well-organised, if rather dense, book, for 'fair
flexibility' - keeping the varied hours and greater productivity of
part-timers but giving them the same rights and pay, pro rata, as
full-timers. She does not believe that making part-timers more expensive
would curtail the supply of part-time jobs, and cites managers who say that
flexible labour is more important than cheap labour.
That may be wishful thinking. Feminists might also take issue with the claim
that part-time work resolves the family/career dilemma for women, preferring
instead better childcare provision and a fairer division of domestic labour
between women and men.
The domestic burden has been spread more evenly in recent years, but only a
little, and Hewitt's assumption that men will be happy to give up full-time
work to share both the paid work and the domestic labour with women may be
premature. As long as the majority of part-time jobs remain poorly paid and
of low status many men will not find such employment an attractive
proposition.
There are, however, some signs that part-time work is now gaining in status
to reach managerial and professional jobs. Less than 3 per cent of employees
in that category are now part-timers and it has traditionally been regarded
as impossible to combine part-time work with a successful career. But given
that the head of personnel at the Department of Social Security can
successfully work part-time, a lot of other senior managers, at least in
large organisations, ought to be able to follow suit. Better-paid
professionals might also seek to trade pay for time off.
About Time does not claim that part-time work is a panacea for unemployment
 -rightly so, as many part-time jobs go to women who would not otherwise be
active in the labour market.
But Hewitt does believe that part of the solution to Britain's unemployment
problem lies in the redistribution of incomes and working time, through
flexible and shorter hours, to those out of work. She also wants to see the
benefit system reformed to make it financially worthwhile for people on
income support to take part-time work.
Britain, along with Denmark and the Netherlands, is likely to remain a world
leader in the creation of part-time jobs in the 1990s. For that reason,
Hewitt's proposal of 'fair flexibility', something that the best employers
are already implementing, deserves a higher position on the political
agenda.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Arts: Dominican 'Running Dream'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Running Dream Trish Cooke has gone in search of her Carribean roots. Her
family came over to England from Dominica, a tiny island with a distinctive
Anglo-French culture. Through the characters of grandmother, mother and
daughters, Cooke conjures with times past, times present, memory and
reality.
It is more an evocation of mood rather than drama. When Florentine
(Claudette Williams) chases William (Wilbert Johnson), the father of her two
girls, to England, she takes one child, Grace (Sherlina Chamberlain) with
her, leaving the other, Clementine (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), behind to be
looked after by her grandmother. Many years later Grace travels back to
Dominica to find her home.
Dominica is full of light and sparkle, childish games and casual courtships.
England, the place of promise and achievement, offers sickness and
materialism. It is no contest, especially when Dominica has all the best
tunes. The most uplifting moments are when the excellent cast break into
song or into the local patois, an intriguing creole of English, French and
African.
Andrea Montag's simple wooden verandah set suggests heat and warmth in
Dominica; imprisonment in England. The evening would have been livelier if
the plot had matched the atmosphere, but events are touched upon rather than
investigated. The transience of Carribean men is well illustrated by their
fleeting appearances on stage. William gives Grace one more child Bianca
(Cathy Tyson) on her arrival in England, and then only pops up again at her
death bed to urge a belated return to the island of innocence.
The character of Bianca, the successful English woman, is only lightly
sketched and one doubts whether she will be really happy back in the
ancestral village. More could have been made of local folk lore and music
but director Olusola Oyeleye certainly lifts you away from bleak Stratford.
The play does not preach, does not judge. It offered to what must have been
one of the largest gatherings of Dominicans in London an instant plug into
their folk memory. They loved it.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Arts: Crazy for You - London Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I don't want to spoil anyone's pleasure, but large parts of Crazy for You
struck me as absolutely dreadful: practically all the parts indeed that do
not consist of songs and lyrics by George and Ira Gershwin. Since the songs
are relatively few, that means that about two thirds of the show is dross.
There is a supreme irony half way through the first act when Ruthie Henshall
as Polly sings the wonderful 'Someone to Watch Over Me'. Ms Henshall sings
well. Her voice can fill the very large Prince Edward Theatre. Some of the
lines in that song, you may remember, go: 'Won't you tell him please, Put on
some speed, Follow my lead.' How she can utter the words 'put on some speed'
with a straight face is beyond me. For anything resembling speed in Mike
Ockrent's production is conspicuously lacking.
There are other gaps. Crazy for You does not have much of a plot, unless you
count an excursion from New York to Deadrock, Nevada. It is rather thin on
jokes. Only two stand out: the arrival of the founder of the Michelin Guide
in Deadrock and the Deadrock citizen who, asked if he has any views on
drama, suddenly begins a lecture on Chekhov and Stanivslaski.
For the rest, the comedy is at the level of: 'I'm not down here to be
insulted.' 'Oh, where do you usually go?' And 'Madame, if you don't like it
here, I can show you the wide open spaces,' followed by the response, 'I
have no desire to look inside your head'. The book is by Ken Ludwig, and
there is an awful lot of it.
Unless you are addicted to tapdancing, there is not much to be said for the
choreography either. One ensemble song and dance scene relies heavily on men
sliding down small sheets of corrugated tin and waving primitive saws. The
same goes for the physical scenes without musical accompaniment. It is
presented as a great feat that someone can fall downstairs without breaking
a leg or prance about the stage with a chair on his head. This sort of thing
belongs to Blackpool pier where it might be better done.
I should add that Crazy is also entirely without characterisation. There is
no Annie, no Eliza, no Henry Higgins, no band of brothers and sisters from
the Salvation Army to stir it up. All the characters in Crazy seem equally
flat and forgettable.
That leaves the Gershwin songs and lyrics. No show that contains
'Embraceable You' and 'They Can't Take That Away From Me' as well as
'Someone to Watch Over Me' can be a complete disappointment. When Kirby Ward
as Bobby sings of 'the way you wear your hat . . . the way we danced till
three' and so on, he is quite as effective as Ms Henshall.
Even here, however, there is something odd. Not all the songs are nearly as
good. The rendering of 'Stiff Upper Lip', for example, is enthusiastic, but
as a lyric or a tune it is not much of a piece of work. The biggest failing
even with the best songs is that they are not integral to the show. They
occur almost at random. Quite the best moment comes when two songs follow
each other: Bobby's 'They Can't Take That Away From Me', immediately
succeeded by Polly's short 'But Not For Me'. Such a rapid response happens
only once. Otherwise, this is a ramshackle show punctuated by bad dialogue
and people with silly voices.
The sets are designed by Robert Wagner. One of them - of the Deadrock
theatre - is well above average. For what is meant to be a spectacular show,
the rest are undistinguished. A Rolls Royce appears on stage, chorus girls
clamber out of it, but the standards of (say) the National Theatre when it
comes to showing off have made us expect something more adventurous than
that.

It will be useful at 9.30 to be the owner of three video recorders. Then,
assuming you are in the middle of the final episode of Turning The Screws,
Roger Graef's documentary series about Wandsworth Prison (9.00 C4) you will
be able to record Chef] on BBC1, second episode in the new foodie comedy
starring Lenny Henry (9.30 BBC1); the second episode in A Labour Of Love
(9.30 BBC2) about child care in the first half of the 20th century which
looks as though it may be nearly as good as 'A Secret World Of Sex"; and the
second part of Disguises in which Adam Holloway finds out what it is like to
be a schizophrenic on the streets. Earlier, in that fascinating series The
Secret Life Of .. Tim Hunkin explains the word processor (8.30 C4). Later in
Harry Enfield's Guide To Opera (10.30 C4) the comedian explains how he
became interested in the subject. This sounds like a series aimed less at
regular readers of the FT arts page than at those who liked the signature
tune for the last World Cup. Thursday is a good night since we also get two

MALCOLM X (15) Spike Lee
TOYS (PG) Barry Levinson
CONSENTING ADULTS (15) Alan J. Pakula
Malcolm X, Spike Lee's movie portrait of the black activist who spent 12
years firebreathing for the Nation of Islam until his assassination in 1965,
is three hours 20 minutes long. At the end we are still not sure what we are
supposed to have been watching. Propaganda? Biography? Social history?
Indignation-as-cinema?
A diffuse mixture of all four is the answer. Aiming to appeal to the widest
possible movie constituency, Lee has made the blandest possible movie. And
perhaps, once a major studio (Warner) and major star (Denzel Washington)
were involved, plus an expanding budget into which everyone from Time Warner
to the Reverend Jessie Jackson threw bundles of money, the writing was on
the wall. In the finished movie, the 'X' in Malcolm X comes to stand not for
the shock-horror lexical sign scrawled on the poster but for that
characterless all-purpose cipher we use in equations.
X for Mr Everyman. X for Take The Cardboard Political Hero You First Think
Of and then multiply by four: one for each of the serial guises Denzel
Washington adopts as we traverse the stations of the black prophet's cross.
Lee's film begins in a stylised 1940s America, with a swooping/craning
camera, a zoot-suited young hero and his pal (played by Spike Lee) and a
dance-hall scene that could have strayed in from John Waters' Hairdo. This
is a flippant and sumptuously disingenuous way to lead up to Malcolm's start
in life as a street pimp and petty crook.
Then we follow our hero into the slammer. Film noir menace; gritty
close-ups; picture of a black man hardening to the punitive reality of the
white man. The movie's third and most sustained Malcolm comes next. A
meeting with a fellow-prisoner leads him to Nation Of Islam leader Elijah
Muhammad and confirms our man in his firebrand vocation as a race-war
orator. Soon we are off into the street marches backed by inspirational
music; the streams of anti-white invective; the famously brusque response to
JFK's assassination ("The chickens have come home to roost"); and the media
Malcolm who burst into the TV and newsreel age to make the sound-bite bite.
But already, here in the film's sprawling midsection, we are hearing a
simultaneous and different sound: that of a film-maker trying to retreat at
the same time that he advances. While not overtly distorting the facts about
his hate-prophet protagonist, a Spike Lee aware of how many non-black people
he must keep from stomping from the cinema if he is to make his money back
increasingly muffles those facts. The 'chickens' quote, for example, is
hidden half-audibly inside a montage of sounds and images conveying the
post-Dallas frenzy. And the words for Malcolm's street speeches are
delivered by Denzel Washington with actorly skill rather than incendiary
elan - and are nearly all taken from his less virulent orations.
Lee, of course, could defend this blanding-out of the middle-period Malcolm
by citing the fourth and last Malcolm: the man who went to Mecca in 1964, a
year before his death, and came back a changed, more peaceable man. Plucking
a new name from the Arab thesaurus - El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz - he renounced
his separatist views. Thanks to this lucky accident of history the film can
segue its dismayingly emasculated pre-'64 Malcolm into the authentically
emasculated figure of the last year. Then it is into the Audubon Ballroom,
New York, for the glorifying martyrdom by Nation of Islam assassins.
Malcolm X achieves the remarkable feat of taking a confrontational hero and
never really confronting him. Good or evil, crackpot or calculating, Malcolm
X raised the emotional stakes of the civil rights debate. A man who made
slap-in-the-face speeches deserves a film with moments of slap-in-the-face
impact.
But Malcolm X is radical chic in the worst sense. It turns its hero into a
tie-in product of yesterday's agitprop fashions, beautified and beatified
for today by the casting of Denzel Washington. This actor has become today's
answer to Sidney Poitier: he is almost impossible to view in any light other
than Mr Nice Guy. Malcolm X should have been a questing, provocateur movie
about the limits - or non-limits - of racial indignation. It should have
kept alive the dramatic torch it lights in the inflammatory opening credits
sequence, as the American flag is cross-cut with footage of the Rodney King
beating. Instead it becomes a mixture of Black Gandhi and Guess Who's Coming
To The Assassination. The chickens, instead of coming home to roost, are
allowed to chicken out.
Toys belongs to that genre of allegorical fiction summarisable as 'All The
World's A (supply missing word)'. Where Orwell gave us the world as an
animal farm, Fritz Lang as a futuristic city, Swift as a package tour to
Parable-land, writer-director Barry Levinson opts for a toy factory. The
'Zevo Toys' plant puffs away on the skyline, like a power station built from
playblocks. Here funny-innocent Leslie Zevo (Robin Williams) and his
funny-robotic sister Alsatia (Joan Cusack) strive to carry on their
late-deceased Dad's traditions of fertile, simple-hearted inventiveness.
But lo] Trouble in Paradise. Dad, it transpires, has willed the place to
their barking mad uncle, General Michael Gambon. He - a Dr Strangelove with
extra weight and a funny accent - wants to turn Zevo Toys into Zevo Weapons.
The Oscar-nominated costumes and designs steal the show. Not only that: they
throw a honking great brick through the flimsy plot and leave a mess of
shattered ideals. Levinson nursed this pet project apparently for 12 years,
all through grown-up films like Good Morning Vietnam, Rain Man and Bugsy.
But the movie as now realised is poised between the arch and the preachy.
While the design caprices constantly bewitch our eyes - the country mansion
that opens like a picture-book, the factory wing shaped like a giant
elephant, the hilly green corridors with crossings for toy ducks - the
message delivered to our ears is less winning. It should say 'Be innocent.'
Instead, scrambled by infantilist sentimentality, it sounds more like 'Be
winsome, whimsical or retarded.'
Americans, being innocent anyway, cannot 'do' innocence. Thinking it
something separate from themselves, they caricature it. Cusack and Williams
both mug and wisecrack bravely to avert coyness - Williams alone is a
one-man Wright brothers in his bid to achieve verbal flights-of-fancy
despite the sticky terrain - but they keep seizing up in whimsy. What can a
grown actress do when required to go night-nights in a giant lacy-fringed
cradle?
Our own Mr Gambon thrives best, as the heavyweight cuckoo lumbering into the
alien nest. The Gambonic use of eyebrow and slow-cranked nasal drawl, even
the hardworking American accent (given a brief early soliloquy of comic
justification), help to give the film what it most needs: not more mercurial
comic lightness but a large chunk of deranged comic solidity.
Finally, here is a structural breakdown to assist you in enjoying Consenting
Adults. Or in deciding if you want to go at all. First part: mildly hypnotic
tale of clean-living couple (Kevin Kline, Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio) led
into criminal and sexual temptation by new neighbour and wife (Kevin Spacey,
Rebecca Miller). Second part: loony thriller in which Kline chases evil
Spacey across Carolina while the womenfolk sit around twiddling their
thumbs. Third part: end credits and dawning realisation that there were even
more holes and inanities in the plot than you first thought.
Alan J. Pakula, who once made Klute, directed. Matthew Chapman, who once
made Strangers Kiss, screenwrote. How are the mighty fallen on hard times.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Arts: Philippe Genty's 'Forget Me Not' - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is it too late for some kind statesman to insert into the Maastricht Treaty
a clause banning all European programme blurb from this country? Please,
please, please? And is it too much to ask anyone visiting the Compagnie
Philippe Genty, now at Sadler's Wells for a fortnight, to refrain from
reading the programme? Genty's show, Forget Me Not, has some enthralling
episodes - enthralling till you read the poetic meanings Genty attaches to
them. I quote: 'So who's falling? You, the reader, Or me, the scribbler? It
all depends on which memory we're in. Mine. Or yours.' One (typical)
biography tells us that Catherine Martin 'was a happy little girl amongst
her twenty midget brothers and sisters. Enchanting music was always flowing
in her head, her pretty little feet kept moving gracefully.' (Genty soon put
a stop to that, by the way.)
Genty is an illusionist. Watching his work is simple, and often pleasurable.
When his illusions are at their best, they achieve far greater poetic
eloquence than his blurb; and even when they are feeble, his spiel misses
the mark. In Forget Me Not, he and his seven performers conjure up vision
upon vision. Sometimes we see how the illusion is achieved, as when, early
on, we discern that half the 14 people in evening dress are in fact
life-size puppets; and then we laugh. Sometimes, as when one woman is
suddenly replaced out of thin fabric by another, we do not know how it is
done; and then we are amazed.
Forget Me Not has three dominant metaphors: the connection between people
and apes; that between people and puppets; and the emergence of people from
base material. We see an ape in an evening dress watching all the rest of
the spectacle, and we see figures in evening dresses suddenly acquiring ape
heads. Genty means some Planet of the Apes idea here, but he seldom develops
it interestingly. And the person/puppet theme is too thinly developed -
despite marvellous incidents. Humans turn into dolls, and vice versa; or
humans are confronted by lifelike, lifesize puppets, by Gargantuan teams, by
Lilliputian replicas.
But the show does become extraordinary - a Darwinian nightmare - in the
scene when we see people locked like larvae into what look like lumps of
clay. Gradually three women break free, like butterflies from chrysalis
form. By then, however, we see that the clay lumps move, are animated; that
they are in fact some kind of huge amorphous slugs. Then the slugs coalesce,
to become a heavy, dull, five-legged creature with a huge body, which
threatens to consume humans. Later, we see people trapped in other clay-like
amoeba, meshed to it by horrid membrane and sucked back into the bowels.
'This is not just dance,' says Genty's programme stuff. Actually, this is
just not dance - though it contains bits of social dance and acrobatic
movement and is wordless. It is less like dance than Pilobolus (which it
resembles or imitates), because it has no particular overall rhythmic
coherence. It also lacks the dream logic to tie its metaphors into a fluent
work of theatrical art.
A pity. The eloquence of its best passages turns out to be just a passing
effect. And the occasional cuteness of French humour is another problem.
Forget Me Not is really just an absorbing circus trick. You cannot help
wishing (like Genty) that it were something more.
Sadler's Wells until March 13

FT  04 MAR 93 / Fugard's 'Playland' - London Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Athol Fugard's Playland is the best play to arrive in London since Tony
Kushner's Angels in America at the Royal National Theatre last year. The
piece has a seriousness of purpose and a tautness of writing seldom seen on
a European stage. It is not just that the subject matters, though of course
it does: everything in the production lives up to it.
Fugard, the South African playwright now in his early sixties, has a
prolific output behind him. His last play at the National, My Children] My
Africa] was a relative flop, partly because it was written before, but
presented after, the release of Nelson Mandela. In Playland Fugard returns
to being the dramatic chronicler of his times: the man who can present hope
out of despair.
The background is the war in what used to be called South West Africa -
South Africa's Vietnam. It is new year's eve 1989: the war is over. Two
characters come together outside a fairground. One is a white South African
former corporal whose experience of killing has left him an emotional wreck,
but also perhaps a wiser man. The other is the black nightwatchman, who has
been guarding the fair for years.
They talk: or rather at the start the white man talks almost to the point of
monologue. He is not especially bitter. He accepts that blacks and whites
will have to live together. Gradually, however, there is a role reversal:
the watchman begins to talk.
The ostensible subject is killing. The watchman believes the sixth
commandment: 'Thou shalt not.' The white cannot get over seeing a record 27
members of SWAPO killed and buried by his unit on one day. But the black,
too, has committed murder: he killed a white man for attempting to sleep
with his woman. Moreover, despite his belief in the commandments, he is not
sorry and would do it again.
Fugard is now a master of dialogue. The facts about both characters slip
out. Sometimes they revert to an atavistic past. The white claims there is
nothing wrong with a white man taking a black woman against her will:
'That's how little white boys learn to do it. And you know something else:
the women like it.' Sometimes the watchman simply wants the white to go
away.
Yet the antagonism that occasionally breaks out is not the whole theme. The
underlying point is about mutual dependency, liking the same things, such as
the freedom to watch the birds in the South African skies and to laugh not
the 'laughter of lies'.
Most impressive of all, none of this is piously done. There is no suggestion
that all whites have learned the same lesson from the war. Indeed the white
soldier now feels estranged from his own people. Here are simply two
individuals talking.
Fugard leaves no doubt, however, that they are both identifiably South
Africans, and know it. The skill with which he does this is shown in the
language. They have begun to share words and accents. This is almost the
first time that I have found an Afrikaans accent on stage sympathetic.
The acting by John Kani as the black and Sean Taylor as the white is
impeccable. Fugard himself directs down to his fingertips and there should
be a special prize for the lighting - note the coming of dawn - by Mannie
Manim. The Donmar Warehouse, small like the Market Theatre in Johannesburg,
is exactly the right place for Playland.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Clash of the cans -
Pepsi-Cola is battling for Europe's taste-buds with a new sugar-free drink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cola wars are hotting up again and this time the main battleground is
Europe. This week, Pepsi-Cola opened up a new front in the offensive by
unveiling a secret weapon: Pepsi Max, a sugar-free cola designed to taste
like the original product.
The product, to be marketed initially in Britain and Italy, is the first
developed by the company specifically for non-American consumers. If it
succeeds, it is likely to be followed by others which acknowledge that
tastes in the US are not always shared in the rest of the world.
The primary target is a share of Coca-Cola's international sales. Three
times larger than Pepsi's, they provide more than two thirds of Coke's
turnover and three quarters of its operating profits. But Pepsi believes Max
can also expand the total soft drinks market, particularly in Europe and
Latin America where cola consumption is a fraction of US levels.
'This is more than just a line extension that will shift shares between
brands. The aim is to create a new market segment,' says Don Holdsworth,
vice-president of marketing at Pepsi-Cola International (PCI). 'We can make
a huge leap forward and have a superb opportunity to open up markets where
diet colas have never taken off.'
His confidence is underpinned by the lengths to which Pepsi has gone to
ensure success. In bringing Max to market, the company turned its
traditional approach to innovation and marketing on its head. For the first
time, it sought to discover at the outset what consumers really wanted and
then created a product around it.
'In the past, we would bring in a product and see if people liked it,' says
Holdsworth. 'In this case, everything was open from the beginning. We didn't
start out with a product, a concept or an advertising campaign.'
The story began 18 months ago when Pepsi set itself the challenge of wooing
international soft drinks consumers who were health-conscious but disliked
diet colas. Though a quarter of US soft drinks consumption, diet colas are
less than 4 per cent of the market in the rest of the world. Since diet
drinkers imbibe 13 per cent more on average than consumers of regular colas,
that translates into a big loss of potential sales.
Market research among non-US consumers who had tried, but rejected, diet
colas revealed two main problems. One was the distinctive, slightly bitter,
after-taste left by artificial sweeteners. The other was image. Many
consumers, particularly in Latin countries, regarded diet products as
effeminate or associated them with disorders such as diabetes and obesity.
However, the research was frustratingly imprecise. It could not establish
exactly what it was about the flavour consumers disliked - or what they
would prefer - because they all used different words to describe tastes and
flavours.
To crack the problem, Pepsi set up panels of volunteers from its research
centre and instructed them to define a common vocabulary to describe subtle
variations in the taste and 'mouthfeel' of colas. After six months of
carefully controlled tests and cross-checking with consumers, the panels
broke down into four separate elements what the public meant by
'after-taste'.
Armed with this information, Pepsi's chemists went to work. Using a new
blend of basic ingredients, injecting a 'top note' flavour and adding ASK -
a new sweetner not yet approved in the US - to the standard aspartame, they
were able to devise a sugar-free formula with a muted after-taste which went
down well in consumer trials.
The next task was to find a suitable name and packaging format - again in
close consultation with consumer 'focus groups' in the target markets. Out
of a list of 13 possible names, which included 'Bold', 'Plus' and 'XT', the
choice came down to 'Max' and 'Pepsi One'. The former was picked because it
suggested maximum cola taste and carried across different languages.
The search for the right packaging also began with a clean slate. Products
bearing the Pepsi brand have used red and blue colours since the 1930s,
since when there have only been four packaging re-designs. 'Until now,
colour design was more heritage than anything else,' says Mark Blecher,
manager of the Max project.
He decided for the first time to test alternatives by asking consumers what
different-coloured cans evoked. It turned out that everyone associated red
cans with coke and red and blue with cola, but that adding other colours
simply confused people. It was decided to stick with Pepsi's traditional
livery, albeit re-styled for use with Max.
The final - and in some ways trickiest - decision was on the advertising
campaign. Prompted by market research which suggested that Max required an
adventurous, masculine image, Pepsi commissioned two commercials featuring
rock-climbers and sky-divers. The company's executives pronounced them a
success. However, test audiences voted them boring.
Pepsi went back to the editing room and jazzed them up. As an insurance
policy, it also re-shot an existing commercial for Mountain Dew - a soft
drink sold mainly in the US - substituting cans of Pepsi Max. In the end,
this proved to be the one viewers liked best, though Pepsi may still use the
other commercials in some markets.
The company is keeping its options open about how fast it rolls Max out
internationally and whether it will become a truly global brand. Much will
depend on the results of test-marketing in Britain and Italy, chosen because
of their widely different patterns of soft-drink consumption.
However, Holdsworth insists that Max is destined to become a leading product
line. 'We are not talking about 5 per cent of the market - if it only got
that, something in the development process would have gone awry. It is a
long-term brand, we expect it to be on the market permanently.'
He is confident that, if Max succeeds, Pepsi will have the market to itself
for some time. Coke's large share of international soft drinks sales, he
argues, means it would stand to gain little volume if it launched a rival
drink, and would risk cannibalising its product range.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Toasting the appeal
of cider - A wider variety has helped revitalise sales and attract more
consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cider is the fastest growing sector of the UK drinks market. Intensive brand
advertising, increased distribution through pubs and supermarkets and lower
excise duties have contributed to the growth. However, cider sales have been
driven in particular by a vigorous, industry-wide programme of new product
development which has attracted new consumers and revitalised the appeal of
older, mainstream brands.
Since 1988, the industry has shown remarkable vitality in raising sales 36
per cent to 84m gallons a year with an estimated retail value of Pounds
750m. Even in the face of recession last year, volume sales increased nearly
10 per cent while beer consumption declined 3 per cent.
Until the early 1980s, consumers were offered little choice beyond dry and
sweet cider. Then Merrydown, the small, Sussex-based cider-maker,
established a premium segment. Unable to compete against the mainstream
volume brands, such as Bulmer's Strongbow and Woodpecker and Taunton's Dry
Blackthorn, Merrydown carved out a higher-margin niche for its bottled
vintage cider, which it packaged and positioned as an alternative to wine.
It was several years, however, before the rest of the industry began to
exploit the opportunities, opened by Merrydown, to move cider into the more
fashionable sector of the drinks market.
Taunton started the push for growth through the development of new products
in 1986. Diamond White, a bottled, strong white cider, was introduced as a
competitor to premium lagers. It was an instant success. Today, with Diamond
Blush, a pink-tinged, lower-strength cider aimed at women, the brand
dominates the premium sector and is still growing strongly.
Taunton followed with the launch in 1989 of Red Rock, a draught cider made
less gassy and acidic for 'session' drinking and aimed once more at young
lager consumers. Supported by Pounds 5m of quirky advertising, it has
secured a 3.5 per cent share of the draught cider market.
'Fermented apple juice can provide a basis for an extraordinary range of
drinks of different colours and tastes,' says Andy Nash, Taunton's marketing
director.
Learning from Taunton's initiatives, the rest of the industry quickly
widened the search for new ways of presenting its basic product and the pace
of innovation accelerated. It sought ideas by investigating trends in
international drinks and consumer goods markets as well as in the UK.
'Talking to consumers can help to identify gaps in the market and enable you
to design products to fit them,' says Elaine Robinson, marketing director
for Gaymer Group, the industry's third-largest company. 'But you have to
look elsewhere for the big ideas, the leaps of imagination that really
change the market.'
Gaymer, anticipating the revival of real ale in the UK, introduced
Addlestone's, a cask-conditioned cider. But it drew inspiration from the
port wine industry for the 1989 launch of K, a strong, dry, bottled cider.
Packaged in a matt black bottle, labelled with a bold red K, it is aimed at
young, style-conscious drinkers. It is the most expensive cider, selling at
up to Pounds 2.50 a bottle, but it is already in the top four premium
brands.
Gaymer and Merrydown have now joined forces to push another new product,
Merrydown's vintage draught, in the UK pub market.
Bulmer, the industry leader, concerned primarily with the distribution and
marketing of Strongbow and Woodpecker, its big volume brands, reacted slowly
to Taunton's new product introductions. It launched Max, Strongbow Super and
1080 as premium products; and all readily found profitable niches.
But it is only in the past two years, with a development team under Gray
Olliver, Gaymer's former marketing director, backed by a Pounds 2.5m
technical research centre, that Bulmer has focused on new products.
They have been pouring on to the market at an impressive rate. Scrumpy Jack,
a half-forgotten brand owned by Bulmer's subsidiary, Symonds, was subtly
refined and revived. With promotional support of only Pounds 500,000, it has
already overtaken Red Rock to become the leading premium draught cider.
Discovery, made from the first apple pressing, has been introduced as a
lightly sparkling 'cider nouveau'. There has been another premium bottled
product, 1727, and Hockhams, a wine alternative.
Black Jack, now being test marketed, combines cider with extracts of malt
and yeast. From its Stassen subsidiary in Belgium, Bulmer is introducing
ciders flavoured with natural fruit juices.
Olliver says he is now investigating the use of cider as a base for
higher-strength aperitifs and liqueurs.
With consumers eager for choice and more adventurous in their tastes,
Taunton's output of new products shows no signs of flagging. It brought five
products to market in seven months last year: Brody, a golden cider which
sold 1m bottles in six weeks after its launch; Applewood and Moonstone,
adult long drinks; Fres, a light sparkling cider; and Drum, a white perry.
All this activity has not only helped lift the overall cider market but has
increased the premium sector from 2 per cent in 1986 to 16 per cent last
year.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Technology: Finding the cause of MS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US scientists have identified the rogue immune cells that are responsible
for multiple sclerosis.
The discovery by Stanford University researchers working with Neurocrine
Biosciences, a San Diego-based biotechnology company, could lead eventually
to a cure for MS, which afflicts more than 2.6m people worldwide.
Although MS has been the subject of intensive research activity worldwide,
there is still no effective treatment for the disease, in which the body's
immune system attacks the protective coating of myelin protein around nerve
fibres. This results in progressive paralysis.
The researchers report in the journal Nature today that they have identified
the specific type of white blood cell (T-cell) responsible for the attack -
and matched its genetic sequence to a corresponding gene on the myelin
protein.
By good fortune, it turns out that the same genetic sequence causes MS in
rats; having an animal model always speeds up drug development. Lawrence
Steinman, leader of the Stanford/Neurocrine research team, says the
scientists are following three approaches:
The primary effort is to make a 'molecular decoy' which can attract the
T-cells away from the myelin. Clinical trials of the first candidate could
start next year.
Antibodies or other molecules could be developed to remove or inactivate the
T-cells.
A vaccine could disable the T-cells.
'All three methods focus on blocking or disabling the very specific immune
response that causes this disease, without suppressing the patient's entire
immune system,' Steinman says.
Once a blocking technique has been developed, it may eventually become
possible to use 'growth factors' to repair the damaged tissues in MS
patients.
But the ultimate cause of MS - what triggers the T-cells to attack - is not
yet understood. One theory is that fragments of viruses mimic parts of the
myelin molecule and trigger auto-immunity.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Technology: More than a droplet in the ocean - Victoria
Griffith reports on a computerised technique that could revolutionise
manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Homogeneity may seem boring to some people, but for scientists and
manufacturers it can be a dream come true. Sectors as diverse as steel,
pharmaceuticals and ceramics are excited about a new technology known as
'droplet-based manufacturing', which uses computers to create and manipulate
minute drops of metals, glass and other substances - all of exactly the same
size.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is at the forefront of research on
the new technique, and is receiving funding from established companies such
as Motorola. Jung-Hoon Chun, a professor at MIT, has developed a
computerised system for creating uniform droplets which he believes will
revolutionise the manufacturing process in many companies.
'With droplet-based manufacturing, we can control the microstructure of
materials and therefore improve their properties at a low cost,' he says.
Materials in liquid form are pushed through a tube with a microscopic hole
at a rate determined by the computer, which also controls the placing of the
drops.
One sector most interested in the new technique is steel. 'Our company may
be able to use this process for the galvanisation of steel parts for
construction,' says Peter Chesney, general manager of new technology at
Chaparral Steel in Texas. 'If you have different-sized droplets of metal,
that affects the quality of the product. You may have to repeat the process
several times, and you get a lot of waste from unusable materials.'
In metal production today, the slow cooling process also encourages the
separation of metal alloys. This means that companies are usually forced to
heat and cool the metal many times to get a uniform substance. With droplet
technology, though, reheating would be unnecessary. Droplets, since they are
small, cool quickly, and prevent the separation of alloys.
Because the droplet technique, which would replace mould and extrusion
processes, is faster, uses less energy and produces products of consistent
quality, companies using the process could save money. 'This could cut our
production costs by a significant amount,' said Chesney.
Another sector with a keen interest in the technology is pharmaceuticals.
Many oral medicines are made up of granules of a specific size so that the
medicine takes effect over a certain period of time. The long-lasting impact
of 24-hour cold medicine, for instance, is determined by the size of the
powder particles. Droplet-based manufacturing would ensure these minute
particles were the right size, preventing the trial-and-error process many
pharmaceutical groups use today.
'With the droplet technique, you can get almost 100 per cent accuracy for
powder production,' says Chun. The 3M Corporation is concerned with
producing uniform drops of a larger size. 'We may use the technology to
produce the glass beads that form reflectors on road signs,' says Kenneth
Smith, technology scout for the group. 'The process is novel because it
would allow you to make only the size of bead you want. In today's
manufacturing, the production of too many wrong sizes is costly and slows
down our output.'
Ain Sonin, also a professor at MIT, has taken the technique one step
further. He is using computers to control the size of the droplets and their
location in the production process. Using a normal computer printer head,
which is usually programmed to place drops of ink in a pre-determined,
letter-forming pattern on a piece of paper, Sonin is aiming to form
computer-controlled patterns in metal.
His goal is to be able to program the design, often so small that it can
only be seen with a microscope, on to a computer disk. The disk would then
be linked to an industrial robot, which would 'draw' the design with metal
or other materials. Sonin hopes this method would allow companies designing
electrical circuit boards, as well as other groups, to alter their
manufacturing process at the touch of a button. 'The technique would be akin
to making alterations on a word processor,' says Sonin. 'You just change a
word here a word there, press the print button and the computer does the
rest.'
It will probably be some time before these droplet techniques are taken up
by industry. 'It will take a few more years to perfect the technology, and
another few to conduct test trials,' says Peter Roberts, engineering manager
for special powders at Nuclear Metals, which makes artificial limbs and
joints. 'We're very excited about the possibilities.'

FT  04 MAR 93 / Technology: A blurred vision of the future - Louise Kehoe
looks at moves in the US to establish high-definition television standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Couch potatoes take note. The technical standards that may determine the
quality of the television pictures you can watch for the next several
decades are about to be decided in Alexandria, Virginia, a suburb of
Washington DC.
This is the site of tests conducted by the Federal Communication Committee's
advisory committee on advanced television. For the past year it has been a
hive of activity as four industry groups have competed to display the
clearest and brightest television pictures.
While the task facing this panel has been to select technical standards for
the US, it appears their decision may also strongly influence
high-definition television standards in Europe, in the wake of the
disintegration of European Community efforts to develop a home-grown version
of HDTV.
Exhaustive - and, according to participants, exhausting - tests of five
proposed versions of HDTV (two from one of the groups) have not yet produced
a clear winner. Last week, the FCC panel, which represents the biggest
companies in US television, deferred a decision, urging three of the four
groups involved to unite in an effort to set a 'world-leading standard' for
HDTV.
The panel concluded that each of the proposed systems had some shortcomings.
One system, from NHK, Japan's public broadcasting corporation, was ruled out
because it uses analogue technology. The FCC had already indicated its
preference for a digital system, which will transform the TV set into a
multi-purpose display for TV and computer images.
Richard Wiley, chairman of the advisory committee, said a 'grand alliance'
of the companies competing to set the standard would combine the best
elements of each one's technology.
Already, two of the three groups - General Instrument with the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and Zenith with AT&amp;T - have agreed to share
royalties if either side wins the competition. A third consortium comprising
NBC, the US television station, Thomson of France, Philips of the
Netherlands and David Sarnoff Research Centre and Compression Labs of the
US, has the choice of competing or collaborating with other participants.
Drawing the industry groups together will be a delicate process, because
they have been contestants in the first round of the competition to
establish industry standards. However, Wiley said that FCC panel members
will help to negotiate an agreement between the groups.
An agreement to merge may be imminent. They face a deadline of March 15 to
decide whether to continue to compete or work together. The pressure to form
a broad alliance is intense in this 'winner takes all' race. A merger would
also rule out appeals from losing parties that could delay the
implementation of HDTV standards.
A 'grand alliance' of the competing HDTV systems 'might more effectively and
rapidly advance the establishment of an HDTV broadcast standard,' Wiley
said.
The advisory panel's decision is now likely to be postponed for several
months. This could delay the FCC's timetable for the final selection of an
HDTV standard. The agency had hoped to make a final choice by the end of
this year.
However, a decision could come much earlier if the four competing systems
are consolidated as now appears likely.
Talks are under way among the groups that could lead to a combination,
according to participants.
Forming an alliance may be easier than agreeing on technical standards,
according to participants. While the business arrangements of such an
agreement can be worked out, each group has 'religious faith' in its
technology.
Pragmatism appears likely to prevail, however, and the consensus is that it
will be possible to blend the best aspects of each proposed system.
Despite the delays, US TV watchers can look forward to viewing HDTV in their
homes by mid-1995 or early 1996. They will, however, have to be prepared to
pay about Dollars 3,000 to Dollars 3,500 for the pleasure of sharper picture
quality.
Those prepared to wait another couple of years may be able to jump on the
bandwagon for a mere Dollars 1,000, according to industry projections - only
two to four times the average US price of a standard TV set.
According to the FCC's current plans, today's standard broadcasts and the
new HDTV signals will co-exist for about 15 years.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Accountancy Column: Measuring earnings after FRS3 - Analysts
seek a standardised view of company performance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute of Investment Management and Research, formerly the Society of
Investment Analysts, has published an Exposure Draft proposing a
standardised treatment of a company's trading earnings for use by analysts,
commentators and other observers. A shortened version of the paper follows:
THE first sentence of paragraph 52 of FRS3 states 'It is not possible to
distill the performance of a complex organisation into a single measure'.
This is manifestly true. The performance of a company is reflected in a
complex and interlocking set of figures, which themselves interrelate with
the industry and economy.
If FRS3 can begin to unravel the myth that a single number determines share
prices, a considerable step forward will have been taken. Nevertheless,
there are several reasons why efforts should be made to delineate some
clearly acceptable earnings figure (or figures).
First, in evaluating a company the stock market must order published
information in some useful way. If this is so, it would be desirable that
the information should as far as possible be ordered in that way in the
calculations of earnings.
Second, there are a large number of users of accounts who do not have the
time or the expertise to make the detailed investigations which are
distilled into the final market price.
Whatever other requirement there may be for an earnings figure it is clearly
desirable, indeed virtually necessary, to define a figure for the company's
earnings for the year which can be used as an unambiguous reference point
between users, the press, the statistical services, etc. This raises the
possibility that such a figure should also be used in preliminary and
interim announcements as a statement of earnings, and how they compare with
the previous year.
The figure - to be known as IIMR headline earnings - should for these
purposes have certain characteristics.
First, it should be a measure of the company's trading performance in the
year, not confused with capital items.
Second, it should as far as possible be robust. That is, the calculation
should be one that can be carried through by anyone presented with the
building blocks of the calculation.
Third, the figure should be factual, including incomes and costs which
actually occurred.
However, headline earnings, because they robustly and factually represent
the past, will not necessarily be the best basis for forecasts of future
earnings. Such forecasts require a great deal of judgment and this is where
individual analysts or research firms can add value on behalf of their
clients. The practical usefulness of the headline earnings figure is,
however, its justification. No one earnings figure can do everything.
These considerations lead to a standard definition of the headline earnings,
calculated for the purposes set out above. It is intended as an additional
figure, which can be reconciled to FRS3 figures subject to the points
discussed below. (see table). The guiding principles follow.
All the trading profits and losses of the company for the year (including
interest) should be included in the earnings number. Items which are
abnormal in size or nature are included. Profits and losses on the sale of
fixed assets or of businesses should be excluded. This does not apply to
assets acquired for resale.
Profit and losses arising in activities discontinued at some point during
the year, or in activities acquired at some point during the year, should
remain in the earnings figure. The costs of eliminating a discontinued
operation, or making an acquisition, and the profits and losses on any
disposals, should be excluded.
Prior period items, and the effect of changes in accounting policies and of
past fundamental accounting errors should not affect the current year's
calculation of earnings. Goodwill should not affect earnings in any way.
Variations in pension fund contributions (and other post-retirement benefit
provisions if any) should be included in earnings, but prominently displayed
if of significant size.
Capital and trading items which arise in currencies other than the reporting
currency should be handled in the same way as the equivalent items arising
in the domestic currency.
The calculation of the headline earnings number should include tax
adjustments to reflect the fact that certain items are excluded from the
headline figure. Apart from these adjustments, the calculation of headline
earnings should normally reflect the tax charge as shown in the company
accounts.
Companies should be encouraged to ensure that adequate disclosures are made
to enable the effect of minority interests to be calculated on any
adjustments that may be made to arrive at the headline figure if these are
not already required.

Investment Management and Research, 211-213 High St Bromley, Kent BR1 1NY.

FT  04 MAR 93 / People: Amstrad's new non-executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jeoff Samson, a former senior GEC executive, has been appointed a
non-executive director of Amstrad.
During Alan Sugar's unsuccessful attempt last December to buy back the
shares he did not already own, he agreed to appoint two non-executive
directors to the board. After the bid was defeated by shareholders, Amstrad
advertised for one applicant with sufficiently senior experience to be able
to 'appraise all financial aspects of the company', and another who 'should
be an industrialist with a consumer product manufacturing background, or be
highly experienced in the distribution of consumer products to trade
customers'.
Samson fits both categories. He has considerable experience in the UK
industrial electronics and consumer products industry gained with Plessey,
Standard Telephones and Cables, where he was a main board director, and more
recently at GEC, where he was managing director of Hotpoint and later
managing director of GEC's consumer products group from 1985 to 1989.
Samson, now 64, subsequently joined Yale and Valor where he was group
managing director until two years ago when the group was acquired by
Williams Holdings.
Last August he joined the board at Hunterprint, the loss-making specialist
printer, as a non-executive director after Sir Ian MacGregor was ousted as
chairman, and in November became part-time chairman working alongside Tony
Caplin, Hunterprint's chief executive, on the rescue operation.
Commenting on his appointment yesterday Samson said it was 'very
challenging, but a tremendous opportunity'. He was selected from a shortlist
of 16 candidates drawn up by ProNed, the organisation which promotes
non-executive directors.
Amstrad's board is continuing to interview shortlisted candidates for the
second non-executive post.

FT  04 MAR 93 / People: Taylor to combine Textiles roles
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Christopher Hogg, an adviser to the Cadbury committee on corporate
governance which recommended that the roles of chairman and chief executive
be split, is handing the chairmanship of Courtaulds Textiles to current
chief executive Martin Taylor.
'Cadbury is not doctrinaire on the subject,' Hogg argues. 'Actually, I'm not
in favour of combining the offices. I did it myself for ten years at
Courtaulds; for the first half of that period the argument for it was very
strong, in the second half, much less so.'
The decision to make 40-year-old Taylor chairman appears largely to have
been dictated by the fact that the obvious candidate, non-executive director
Antony Hichens, who becomes deputy chairman instead, had made clear he was
unavailable.
'First, he has an enormous amount on his plate,' says Hogg, 'and moreover,
whereas he felt very comfortable making sure there was no abuse of power, he
thought that after three years on the board he did not know enough about the
industry to be able to supply the strategic vision required of a chairman.'
Hichens is chairman of MB-Caradon and Y J Lovell Holdings, and has some ten
other non-executive directorships.
Of Taylor, a Courtaulds highflyer and former Financial Times journalist,
Hogg adds: 'Martin is less of a potential power-abuser than anyone I can
think of.' Taylor, for his part, contends Hichens is one of the most
forceful non-executives he has met - 'marvellous and terrifying'.
The sudden death of 53-year-old Ian Rae has prompted further boardroom
changes, with Andrew Harrison, 35, presently finance director, moving to
take charge of home furnishings and the UK branded clothing business, Rae's
domain. 'It was perfectly clear to me he would either become the finance
director of a much larger company or run a business,' says Taylor, who
acknowledges that Rae's death forced his hand, and that he had been planning
initially to give Harrison a slightly smaller 'line' job than the current
assignment.
Harrison is replaced by Pippa Wicks, 30, who joined from Bain &amp; Company,
also Harrison's training ground, two years ago as business development
manager.
As if he were not busy enough, Taylor meanwhile signals that he will shortly
pick up his first outside directorship - of an FT-SE 100 company in an
unrelated business.

Argyll Group's decision yesterday to 'tidy up' the relationship between its
Safeway and Presto/Lo-Cost retailing chains and formally split them into two
divisions has led to some management changes.
Patrick Kieran (right), an Argyll Group main board director and current
managing director, Safeway operations, has become managing director of the
Safeway Stores division.
Kieran, 54, has 36 years' experience with Safeway, and since the chain's
acquisition by Argyll six years ago, has been responsible for Safeway's
retail operations. During that time, the number of stores has increased from
133 to 340 and selling space more than tripled from 2m to 7m square feet.
His role will embrace trading, marketing and support functions for the first
time.
Logan Taylor, currently managing director, Safeway trading and marketing,
becomes the division's deputy managing director.
In the newly-created Presto and Lo-Cost Stores division, Charles Lawrie, the
Argyll director who has been responsible for these stores for seven years,
is appointed managing director.
Argyll's property and development activities, which provide services to all
three, will continue to be directed by Gordon Wotherspoon.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Restoring fish stocks in north Wales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The tunnelling company of TRAFALGAR HOUSE CONSTRUCTION has won a design and
construct contract in north Wales to build a Pounds 410,000 fish pass around
the Conwy Falls, near Betws-y-Coed.
The fish pass is designed to restore stocks of salmon and sewin in the upper
reaches of the River Conwy and its plans have been under discussion for 10
years.
The company and its consulting engineers, Donaldson Associates, won the
contract after submitting an alternative proposal to the Conwy Trust and the
National Rivers Authority.
The fish pass has been specifically designed so as not to spoil the scenic
beauty of the area and trees which have to be removed while work is in
progress will be replanted.
The pass will consist of a 48 metre tunnel containing 28 separate pools to
allow the fish to move upstream. As the river prevents access to either end
of the tunnel, work will commence with the sinking of a 14 metre deep
circular access shaft adjacent to the falls. From this shaft the company
will drive a tunnel 15 metres uphill and 33 metres downhill without breaking
through to the surface.
All the work on the shaft and tunnels will involve hand drilling and
blasting with debris being removed by a grab mounted on the end of a crane.
The breakthrough will form the last stage of the project as water must be
kept out of the tunnel to allow the construction of the pools.
The pools will be formed from reinforced concrete and will be about three sq
metres , allowing the energy of the water to be dissipated and making the
fish's 13 metre ascent easier.
The level between pools will be 500mm and a notch will be carved in the
tunnel wall to assist the fish's climb. Walkways will be installed over the
pools and will be reached via the original access shaft which will be capped

FT  04 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading trunk roads in Wales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ACER CONSULTANTS, based in Guildford, Surrey, has been awarded the route
study commission for the proposed dualling of the A465 heads of the valleys
trunk road, between Abergavenny and Hirwaun in south Wales.
The scheme, planned at an estimated cost of Pounds 145m, was originally
announced in May 1991 as part of a Pounds 460m expansion of the Welsh Office
motorway and trunk road programme.
Acer's study will address the objectives of the scheme, which are to provide
dual-carriageway traffic capacity by developing environmentally acceptable
and safe proposals. The timing of construction will also be considered and
the study will advise on priorities and whether the work should be phased.
The study includes a section with particularly difficult topographical,
geotechnical and environmental problems in the Clydach Gorge, between
Abergavenny and Brynmawr, where it also passes through the Brecon Beacons
National Park. This area contains a number of sites of special scientific
interest and a national nature reserve, as well as limestone caves,
woodland, landscape protection areas and sites of archaeological value.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Water companies warn of high clean-up costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER COMPANIES called yesterday for more flexible standards on drinking
water and warned that complete elimination of lead from water could cost
Pounds 8bn.
European countries should have the right to set their own standards on the
colour and taste of drinking water where there were no health implications,
said Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association, which
represents the 10 large water and sewerage companies of England and Wales.
The WSA said it accepted the World Health Organisation's tighter guidelines
on lead, which is thought to pose health risks, but warned that much of the
Pounds 8bn cost for removing lead from water would fall on householders. It
also called yesterday for a UK policy on pesticides to reduce the level of
chemicals that run off fields into the water supply and require expensive
removal.
The UK move is part of an attempt by Eureau, a lobby group representing
national water companies from all EC countries except Greece, to persuade
the European Commission to change its water directives. Officials from the
Commission's environment directorate, speaking yesterday at the opening of
Eureau's conference in Madrid, said they wanted to hold a seminar by the
autumn on the need to review the standards.
The drinking water standards, set in 1980, are among the most ambitious
environmental measures passed by EC members and have become increasingly
controversial as the true cost of compliance has become clear. UK companies
have suggested that nearly half of the Pounds 45bn they are likely to invest
this decade will be as a result of EC directives.
Ofwat, the regulator of the UK companies, has repeatedly questioned whether
some of the standards are unnecessary and too stringent.
The European water companies want limits on the levels of iron, magnesium,
manganese, copper and zinc, which they argue have no impact on health, to be
interpreted more flexibly by the Commission.

MR GORDON LAYTON, the chief executive of National Car Parks, was given
repeated assurances about the legality of infiltrating 'moles' and other
covert methods used to investigate the company's main business rival, the
jury in the Old Bailey industrial espionage trial was told yesterday, John
Mason writes.
He trusted advice given to him by KAS, the security firm which carried out
the investigation of Europarks for NCP, that such techniques were both legal
and ethical, Mr Alex Carlisle, QC for Mr Layton, told the court.
These included surveillance of Europarks directors, the searching of rubbish
bins and the infiltration of KAS employees onto the Europarks staff.
Mr Layton, who has chosen not to go into the witness box to give evidence,
denies conspiring with Mr Simon Hewitt, a former KAS manager, to defraud
Europarks by dishonestly obtaining information about its business
activities.
The trial continues today.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Maxwell's Pounds 1/2 m surprise: Son of corrupt tycoon
averts bankruptcy with payment to liquidators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN MAXWELL yesterday avoided the immediate threat of bankruptcy when he
made a last-minute payment of Pounds 500,000 to the liquidators of
Bishopsgate Investment Management, the former manager of the Mirror Group
Newspapers pension funds.
Mr Maxwell had been ordered to pay the money in December after a High Court
judge ruled that he had breached his duty as a BIM director by agreeing to
the transfer of shares worth about Pounds 580,000 to Credit Suisse without
obtaining an assurance that the BIM board had approved the transfer.
The bankruptcy proceedings were set in motion after Mr Maxwell's lawyers
indicated that he could not afford the interim payment.
However, five minutes before yesterday's bankruptcy hearing was due to
start, Mr Maxwell handed over a banker's draft for Pounds 500,000 to Miss
Margaret Cole of Stephenson Harwood, the solicitors acting for BIM. He also
agreed to pay the substantial legal costs of bringing the bankruptcy
proceedings against him. He then left without waiting for formal dismissal
of the bankruptcy petition. His payment of the money prompted speculation
about the origin of the funds and the apparent change in his financial
circumstances.
Mr Frank Field, chairman of the House of Commons social security committee
which is investigating the Maxwell affair, said the 'magic' production of
the money came as no surprise. 'Whenever the Maxwells have been in
difficulty money has arrived,' he said.
Mr John Clitheroe of Kingsley Napley, Mr Maxwell's solicitor, refused to
comment on the source of the money but said: 'Ill-informed speculation on
these matters is a pity.' Miss Cole said the money would go into the fund
for the benefit of Mirror Group pensioners. But Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman
of the Maxwell Pensioners' Action Group, said the payment was 'really
disappointing' and would yield only a minute sum for each pensioner.
The liquidators would continue their claim against Mr Maxwell for the
outstanding balance of Pounds 80,000, plus interest since September 1991,
she said. They would also consider the position regarding their outstanding
claim against Mr Maxwell for more than Pounds 400m.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Clearer message is demanded: Michael Cassell explains why
industrialists have become dissatisfied with ministers' policies -  Spring
Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH industry is usually quick to cut through the verbiage wrapped around
the chancellor's Budget proposals in search of specifics. This time,
however, given the tight constraints imposed by a rocketing deficit, Mr
Norman Lamont's language will have to count for a lot.
Expectations of fiscal help for industry are modest although the business
community has been encouraged by the government to prepare for a package
targeted towards helping the process of industrial recovery.
Before Christmas, Mr John Major, the prime minister, committed Mr Lamont to
a package intended to raise manufacturing output. This week again, Mr Major
hinted that small businesses, with their potential for job creation, would
be among the main beneficiaries of any tax concessions.
Having raised expectations, the government can expect little sympathy if it
fails to deliver.
Business leaders have become irritated and frustrated with ministerial pleas
for patience and pledges of 'good times just around the corner'. They want
details of a policy framework to restore investment, jobs and confidence and
they want them next week.
'There remains a huge gap in understanding,' according to Mr Howard Davies,
director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. 'The government
has still not explained what it means by a policy for growth and recovery.
'Half the world thinks we are now hooked on a policy of competitive
devaluation, which is dangerous and could be self-fulfilling. We want to
hear ministers say revival must be heavily based on production, exports and
investment, not on consumption. It has to be set out. They must say it.'
Industrialists don't want tax increases, but they believe the government
must provide some indication as to how additional revenues will be raised,
possibly for enactment in the December Budget.
Higher corporate taxes are ruled out as economic madness. Increases in
personal taxation, by extending the value added tax net, are portrayed not
just as a breach of faith. They are also painted as a potential broadside
into a floundering economy which must expand if the public sector borrowing
requirement is to be cut significantly.
But with early VAT changes on the cards, some comfort is being drawn from
the suggestion that an element of the additional revenue could be employed
to promote investment, recovery and exports.
Beyond its wider strategic concerns, industry inevitably has its shopping
list of proposals, including
further carefully targeted tax incentives to boost manufacturing investment,
which is set to decline in 1993 for the fourth consecutive year.
Following the temporary enhancement of capital allowances on investment
included in the Autumn Statement, there are calls from organisations such as
the Engineering Employers' Federation for them to be extended permanently to
100 per cent.
The Institute of Directors prefers to concentrate on corporation tax cuts
while the CBI wants last autumn's improvements in allowances to be extended
for a further period.
There is general agreement that the government, having acknowledged the need
for changes to advance corporation tax - which encourages companies with UK
headquarters to shift investment overseas - must now grasp the nettle.
Relief from an unfair burden is demanded and the chancellor will win no
friends if he avoids the issue again. Industry also wants lower capital
gains taxes.
The IoD believes the time is ripe for 'drastic reductions' in a tax which
limits availability of vital venture capital.
There is also pressure on the government to design a replacement for the
expiring Business Expansion Scheme. Cuts in inheritance taxes and a freeze
of the uniform business rate, still regarded as a slap in the face for
struggling small businesses, are also on the list.
Hopes are high of more help for exporters, who have complained that
expensive and limited export credit cover is putting at risk jobs and
overseas sales.
The strictures on cover have been held up as a classic case of government
doublespeak in which the Department of Trade and Industry exhorts companies
to trade abroad whilst ECGD cover remains costly and elusive.
Rates are currently being reviewed.
According to Mr Davies: 'The current position is absurd. We should have the
lowest export export credit rates because export trade is so vital to us. We
cannot even get cover in countries like Argentina, which is privatising like
mad and is crying out for experience like ours'.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Gas bills 'could be cut by 10%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSEHOLDS could save 10 per cent of their gas bills, about Pounds 50 a
year, if the British Gas monopoly of domestic supply was removed, Alliance
Gas, a leading independent gas supplier, said yesterday.
Alliance, a joint venture between British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil,
says the introduction of competition to the industrial gas market has saved
British industry Pounds 100m over the past three years.
'The new independents are much leaner and more cost-effective organisations
than British Gas,' said Mr Kristoffer Maroe, managing director of Alliance.
British Gas claimed on Monday that gas prices would rise 15 per cent if its
business were broken up and competitors were allowed to supply households.
It said customers farthest from gas terminals would pay more for their
supply.
Mr Maroe said: 'It would be possible to guarantee customers a general saving
of around 10 per cent and, in certain areas which may be particularly cheap
to supply, there could be even larger savings.'
Sir James McKinnon, the gas industry regulator, called for a wholesale
break-up of British Gas on Monday, and said it would result in lower prices
for customers.
Mr Maroe said he did not believe a full break-up of British Gas into 12
regional companies was necessary to achieve greater competition. But he has
told the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that British Gas's pipelines and
storage arm must be hived off to facilitate the development of competition.
The MMC is reviewing the structure of the gas business in the UK and is due
to make a report in April.
'If the transportation arm is not hived off, it will make a lot of
competitors very reluctant to sustain long-term competition,' said Mr Maroe.
Alliance supplies 6,000 industrial sites with gas and has entered into
partnerships with East Midlands Electricity and Manweb through which Mr
Maroe believes it could supply the whole country with gas once the market
opens up.

FT  04 MAR 93 / NCP chief 'was assured on moles'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON LAYTON, the chief executive of National Car Parks, was given
repeated assurances about the legality of infiltrating 'moles' and other
covert methods used to investigate the company's main business rival, the
jury in the Old Bailey industrial espionage trial was told yesterday.
He trusted advice given to him by KAS, the security firm which carried out
the investigation of Europarks for NCP, that such techniques were both legal
and ethical, Mr Alex Carlisle, QC for Mr Layton, told the court.
These included surveillance of Europarks directors, the searching of rubbish
bins and the infiltration of KAS employees onto the Europarks staff.
Mr Layton, who has chosen not to go into the witness box to give evidence,
denies conspiring with Mr Simon Hewitt, a former KAS manager, to defraud
Europarks by dishonestly obtaining information about its business
activities.
Mr Layton was entitled to reply on the public perceptions of both KAS and
the SAS, from which the security firm had recruited its staff, of a high
level of training and discipline, Mr Carlisle said.
'Whether they (KAS) were right or wrong, they thought that what they were
doing was perfectly legal and ethical and that was the message they gave to
their clients,' he said.
The trial continues today.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Lotus wins Taiwan order: General Motors may now find selling
the division a difficult option
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUP LOTUS, the Norfolk-based sports car and engineering concern, has won a
Taiwan government-backed contract to help develop car engine production in
the country.
The contract, which the company said yesterday would be worth 'quite a few
millions' over several years, may make a decision by General Motors to sell
Lotus more difficult. GM has owned Lotus since 1987.
Several interested parties have approached GM about the purchase of all or
parts of Group Lotus including a management team led by managing director Mr
Adrian Palmer.
GM has not disclosed details of any of the other approaches, which followed
a decision last year to abandon production after less than two years of the
Elan small sports car which Lotus had hoped to sell at a rate of 3,000 a
year.
The car was widely regarded as too expensive and never came close to sales
targets.
As a result Lotus Cars, the carmaking division which now produces only the
very low volume Esprit 'supercar', has been making heavy losses for the past
two years. It now employs only 200 people - one third of 1991 levels.
Lotus Engineering, the consultancy division which has won the Taiwan
contract, earned more than Pounds 30m in 1991 and is understood to have made
substantial profits last year, although figures have yet to be released.
The division is now substantially larger than the carmaking side of the
business, with 500 employees.
The Taiwanese deal involves technology transfer by Lotus to the Taiwan
government-backed Industrial Technology Research Institute.
Four Taiwanese carmakers - Yulon Motor, China Motor Corp, San Yang Industry
and Yeu Tyan Machinery Manufacturing - are also taking part in the project,
which aims to bring into volume production a range of 1.2 litre and 1.6
litre car engines by 1997.
Taiwanese officials said the project would help to upgrade the island's car
industry and reduce its reliance on imports of components from Japan.
General Motors' dilemma is that while it would probably be glad to be rid of
the loss-making car side of the business, GM is itself one of the biggest
customers for Lotus Engineering's design and development services.

FT  04 MAR 93 / East Midlands business leaders want government spending to
be maintained in real terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business leaders in the east Midlands want government spending to be at
least maintained in real terms, and believe that any increase should be
financed by extending the scope of value added tax.
A poll of 100 executives by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, found
most wanted higher government spending on transport and capital
infrastructure, but lower spending on social security benefits.
The survey of business opinion in Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire,
Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire was published yesterday.
The business leaders are anxious that Mr Lamont should extend indefinitely
the temporary increase, announced in the last Autumn Statement, of capital
allowances for plant, machinery and industrial buildings.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Heseltine backs export drive in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday lent his
support to the launch of one of Britain's most ambitious export promotion
campaigns, in spite of criticism that it is poorly timed.
The campaign, North America Now, is aimed at reversing a long decline in
Britain's share of the US market and at forging joint ventures for
medium-sized companies. But
it comes as a new US administration is drawing up potentially protectionist
trade policies.
Mr Heseltine said the campaign's timing could not be better. Sterling's
devaluation had boosted opportunities for exporters, and there was clear
evidence that the US and Canada were emerging strongly from recession.
The Pounds 1.8m three-year campaign comes after five years in which the
European single market has been the main focus of Britain's export promotion
strategy.
No formal target has been set, but the government hopes the UK share of US
visible imports can be lifted from 3.8 per cent to 5 per cent by 1995,
boosting exports in money terms by about Pounds 3bn a year from the current
Pounds 12.2bn.
The campaign has several innovative features including the targeting of 20
US sectors with 50 events planned in north America over six months; nine
'export promoters' seconded to the DTI from the private sector will work
with prospective exporters as part of the campaign; there will be an
education programme including 10 scholarships a year at the JL Kellogg
School of Management in Chicago and workshops on issues such as US sales
practices and how to reduce market entry overhead costs; and a 'big
companies partnership' will be created involving discussions with leading
exporters to the US on where the government can assist in overcoming trade
barriers, or in defining how US trade and investment fits into the
companies' growth strategy.
Regional initiatives will range from backing a partnership between the oil
regions around Calgary and Aberdeen to a sectoral initiative between Wales
and Ontario, and an 'America Week' in Birmingham this month to coincide with
British Airways' inaugural direct flight to New York.
Another element in the campaign is the appointment of Price Waterhouse, the
accountancy and management consultancy group, to work with 50 medium-sized
companies a year with the aim of forging 'strategic partnerships' in the US.
The aim is to introduce each company to up to three prospective US partners.
It is hoped to set up 10 to 15 partnerships each year over the three years
of the campaign, generating earnings towards the UK balance of payments
amounting to Pounds 30m.
'These companies will not be beginners,' said Mr Ian Guthrie, partner at
Price Waterhouse responsible for the project. 'They should have between 100
and 500 staff, a turnover of Pounds 10m-Pounds 50m, and a good foothold in
the US market already. They will be companies that have put serious time
into export promotion as part of a clear business plan.'

FT  04 MAR 93 / Midlands attracts advice shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans to set up a network of one-stop business advice centres
have taken off better in some parts of the country than in others.
If the locations of the business partnerships applying to run the centres is
reflected in eventual contract awards, there will be a disproportionately
large number of 'one-stop shops' in the Midlands and the north of England.
The response in the south and the south-west has been less strong. Most of
the partnerships are led by Training and Enterprise Councils, the
employer-led bodies that deliver government training schemes in England and
Wales.
Interviews to select 15 pilot outlets, announced last December by Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, will begin shortly. The DTI has
received a total of 57 applications.
Mr Heseltine hopes the shops, which will eventually number 200, will
revolutionise support for British companies.
The outlets will bring together the business services of chambers of
commerce, local authorities, local enterprise agencies and the DTI.
Mr Heseltine has allocated Pounds 3.5m for the 'one-stop shops' from the
Tecs' budgets and the government hopes that the services, many of which are
now free, will be charged for.
Mr Heseltine was asked in the Commons last year whether the pilots would be
spread to represent regions of high business failures. He replied that the
basis for choosing the successful bids would be 'one of quality'.
The UK has received more US overseas direct investment since 1987 than any
other country, a study said yesterday.
Some 21 per cent of US overseas investment came to the UK, which also
received 9 per cent of Japanese overseas direct investment, ahead of any
country except the US.
The study, by the Centre for Economics and Business Research on behalf of
the CBI, shows that nearly a fifth of the Pounds 220bn invested in British
industry since 1987 came from abroad.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Treasury ahead of deficit schedule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is well ahead of its schedule for financing this year's
budget deficit, a Treasury report stated yesterday.
The monthly monetary report said the public sector borrowing requirement was
overfunded by Pounds 9.6bn by the end of January. The overfunding was almost
entirely explained by intervention to support the pound before it left the
European exchange rate mechanism in September.
However it is too early to judge how overfunded the authorities will be at
the start of the next financial year in April. The government is expected to
have to finance a PSBR of about Pounds 50bn in 1993-94.
The report also pointed out that the surprise public-sector budget surplus
in January was due partly to higher VAT receipts, which have been
temporarily distorted by the reintroduction of postponed accounting for VAT.
The Treasury also underlined prospects for an economic recovery this year,
pointing out that UK retail sales remain on an upward trend and that output
expectations have improved.
The report says: 'Retail sales rose strongly in January, more than
recovering December's unexpected fall.' It adds that 'UK demand and activity
in late 1992 appear to have been, if anything, a little stronger than the
Autumn Statement forecast assumed'.
Although the report reiterates the government's optimistic view on inflation
 -pointing to the sharp fall in retail price inflation in January, and a
recent fall in pay settlements - it acknowledges the first signs that
sterling's devaluation is feeding through to prices.
The Treasury notes that output prices in the latest three months increased
at a slightly faster rate than in the three months ending in December.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Minister warns about navy order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE and DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JONATHAN Aitken, the defence procurement minister, was warned yesterday
about the future of Swan Hunter. The Tyneside shipbuilder, which has a blank
order book after next year, is dependent on its bid for a Ministry of
Defence helicopter carrier - a Pounds 170m order which may be shelved
because of financial pressures on the defence budget.
Mr Aitken, who was visiting Swan Hunter to see work in progress, said that
the government, now studying bids for the Landing Platform Helicopter
vessel, had taken the carrier into account in drawing up its future defence
budget. However, he he warned that a final decision depended on available
resources.
He added: 'No minister can give a guarantee but we are proceeding in good
faith.'
A decision will be made by the autumn. Without the order Swan Hunter, now
reducing its workforce by 1,400 to 2,200, looks set to close.
Campaigning by management, unions and Tyneside MPs has left ministers well
aware of the impact that the closure of Swan Hunter would have on Tyneside's
economy and morale.
Britain has made preliminary contacts with Canada on the possible transfer
of the Royal Navy's latest diesel-powered patrol submarines, David White
writes.
The move would be part of a plan to find equipment savings to match the
Pounds 1bn cut decided last November in the UK defence budget over the next
two financial years. The four new Upholder class submarines have cost the
MoD about Pounds 800m.
The defence ministry said yesterday no decision had been taken on whether to
dispose of them.
According to the magazine Jane's Defence Weekly, Canada would favour a
leasing arrangement while the UK would prefer an outright sale.
The last of the submarines, HMS Unicorn, built at the VSEL group's Cammell
Laird in Birkenhead, is undergoing trials. Under its Options for Change
programme, the MoD decided against building any more of the boats.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Major urges companies to be aggressive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday renewed his attack on the 'British disease' of
talking down achievements and presenting an image of a nation in decline.
Speaking at a conference on British style, quality and innovation organised
by the Walpole Committee, a group of companies in the upmarket goods and
services sector, he urged companies to be more aggressive in promoting their
products against foreign competitors.
'Perhaps we have played at being gentlemen in industry and commerce for too
long,' he said. 'We need to join the players.'
Stressing the importance of quality, he said: 'Producing quality is not an
optional extra in the 90s. It is absolutely essential for success.' Mr
Major's comments marked the latest shot in a determined campaign by 10
Downing Street to 'talk up' the economy's prospects.
While the Treasury has been reticent about claiming that the recession has
ended, the prime minister is voicing optimism that recovery is already under
way. His concern is that what he termed the 'British instinct for
self-deprecation' could undermine the upturn in consumer and business
confidence needed to sustain rising demand.
Mr Major intends to pick up the same theme in a speech in Harrogate on
Saturday. In an address billed as an important statement of his political
strategy, he will attempt to reassure Conservative party activists that
economic recovery will restore the government's battered authority. The
prime minister, who returned last month from a trade mission to Saudi
Arabia, said he would take more businessmen abroad with him on trips if it
helped to open doors.
The Walpole committee was set up last year and has 20 members. It aims to
focus international attention on British excellence and style in the
manufacturing, service and creative fields and to create a working body to
help companies in the sector to grow.
The committee is named after Sir Robert Walpole, the first British prime
minister, known for his trade promotion.
A survey of the chairmen and managing directors of 35 companies in the
quality goods area showed that 78 per cent thought it helpful to have
products marked 'Made in Britain', while 9 per cent thought it was not.
The four sectors which UK companies felt were most associated by foreigners
with British style and quality were 'classic clothing,' china, retailing and
food and drink.
However, 55 per cent of respondents felt British companies in the quality
goods sector were losing out to foreign competition.
The most commonly cited reasons were that foreign companies were better at
marketing and product development. Sixty-one per cent of respondents said
the main strength of British companies was their branding.
Mr Ivor Owen, director-general of the Design Council, said that while the
image created by Britain's upmarket companies was one of permanence,
tradition and craftsmanship, they were operating in an extremely
fast-changing marketplace.
Walpole Committee members include George Ballantine, the whisky group; J.
Barbour, manufacturer of country clothing; and Chewton Glen, the country
house hotel.
'Amongst your members are a large number of success stories. I hope you will
forgive me if I single any of you out, but I think it helps illustrate how
wrong the gloomsters are: The Financial Times (international edition) has
increased its circulation in the last five years by 67 per cent, and since
printing began in Japan two years ago, sales there have grown by 135 per
cent. William Grant continues to expand in their export markets and they
have now made Glenfiddich famous worldwide as a symbol of quality. Dawson
International, owners of Pringle and Ballantynes, are competing and
succeeding in Germany and in Japan. I would stretch these examples across
wide areas of British industry and endeavour.'
John Major

FT  04 MAR 93 / Repossession prices fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES of properties reposs-essed by mortgage lenders are falling at a much
faster rate than house prices in general, according to a survey by Special
Risk Services, an insurance broker which specialises in financial
insurances.
The survey examined sales of properties repossessed between 1988 and 1992 by
looking at 1,058 settled mortgage indemnity insurance claims. It found that
on average the values of the properties had fallen by 33 per cent. By
contrast general house prices have fallen by up to 20 per cent since 1988.
Mr Dane Douetil, a mortgage indemnity specialist with SRS, said: 'The
financial impact on both borrowers and lenders is worse in a repossession
situation than the headline figures suggest.'
The extent of the fall indicates that some mortgage lenders may be
underestimating the extent of their losses arising from mortgage default.
Mortgage indemnity insurance covers lenders against a portion of losses they
suffer on the sale of repossessed properties. In the SRS sample of
repossessed properties the average drop in value was steepest in East Anglia
(40.45 per cent), while Greater London, the south-west and the south-east
show reductions of 35.26 per cent, 34.97 per cent and 30.69 per cent
respectively.
Factors responsible for the sharp fall in value of repossessed properties
include: the poor state of repair of properties before and after
repossession; the fact that an empty house does not 'show well' for
potential buyers; and the need for lenders to sell the property within a
reasonable period of time following repossession.
The survey also shows that on average over the last three years it has taken
166 days for a lender to apply to the courts for a repossession of a
property following the first arrears by the borrower.
A Pounds 577m government programme to buy empty properties in England to aid
the housing market and provide accommodation for the homeless has beaten its
target of 16,000 homes by the end of March, the Housing Corporation said
yesterday.
The scheme, had approved purchases of 18,000 homes.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Customs predicts Pounds 250m duty loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW single-market personal allowances on drink and cigarettes carried into
the UK from other European Community countries are expected to cost the
government Pounds 250m a year in lost Customs duties, the Commons trade and
industry committee was told yesterday, David Dodwell writes.
Mr Michael Knox, head of the Customs and Excise Single Market Unit, said 150
Customs officers had been deployed across the UK in an effort to clamp down
on illegal imports. He added that on average one illegal sale a day had been

Most of the cases involved duty evasion of Pounds 1,000 or less.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Nationwide building society says there are grounds for
cautious optimism over house prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE, Britain's second-biggest building society, said yesterday that
there were grounds for cautious optimism that the housing market was on the
move in spite of reporting another fall in prices.
The society said that house prices on average had fallen 1.4 per cent in
February compared with the previous month. This had offset a rise of 1.2 per
cent in January.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive, said price changes tended to lag
sales activity. He added: 'In fact there have been increased levels of
activity from house buyers.'

FT  04 MAR 93 / Level of business failures declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CARDIFF-based maker of Christmas crackers, a Cambridge potato farm and
five London restaurants were among more than 400 businesses which failed
last month.
Fewer companies were wound up than in February 1992, confirming the downward
trend in insolvencies. Figures compiled by Touche Ross show that the 404
receiverships or administrative receivership appointments compared with 539
in February 1992 and 561 in February 1991. Receiverships and administrations
are running at 90 a week compared with 100 a week last year. Touche Ross
warned that businesses need additional liquidity. 'The majority of
additional funding, at least in the short term, has to come from bank
borrowing. If businesses are to benefit from the upswing, the high street
banks will have to give additional support.'

FT  04 MAR 93 / Price Waterhouse appointed linchpin at core of government's
North America Now campaign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE WATERHOUSE, the accountancy and management consultancy group, has been
appointed the linchpin in the 'strategic alliances' initiative at the core
of the government's North America Now campaign.
Its task will be to work with about 50 medium-sized UK companies a year with
the aim of introducing them to up to three prospective US partners. The
objective over the three-year campaign will be to forge 10 to 15 successful
partnerships each year, generating earnings towards the UK balance of
payments amounting to Pounds 30m.
'These companies will not be beginners,' said Mr Ian Guthrie, partner at
Price Waterhouse responsible for the project. 'They should have between 100
and 500 staff, a turnover of Pounds 10m-Pounds 50m, and a good foothold in
the US market already. They will be companies that have put serious time
into export promotion as part of a clear business plan.
'The main challenge is to try to bring to the middle-sized company the type
of services that would normally be available only to larger companies.
Without these rigorous support services, company initiatives often fade out
because smaller firms lack the internal dynamic to bring them through.'
Price Waterhouse has 46 professionals based in the US, with offices in New
York, Boston, Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles and Chicago providing platforms
from which to begin the search for partners.

FT  04 MAR 93 / American investors target Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK has received more US overseas direct investment since 1987 than any
other country, according to a study released yesterday.
Some 21 per cent of US overseas investment came to the UK, which also
received 9 per cent of Japanese overseas direct investment, ahead of any
country except the US.
Within the European Community the UK benefited from 41 per cent of total
Japanese investment over the past three years.
The study, by the Centre for Economics and Business Research on behalf of
the Confederation of British Industry, shows that inward investment has
become an important component of total investment in the UK, with nearly
one-fifth of the Pounds 220bn invested in British industry since 1987 coming
from abroad.
The motivations of US and Japanese companies were different, according to
the study. US investors aimed at UK domestic markets and specific
opportunities in the finance and oil sectors, while Japanese companies
pursued access to other EC markets.
The study concludes that the spurt in US investment may have ended, with
much of the growth in the late 1980s reflecting companies' desire to 'catch
up' with the UK's improved economic growth. It says future US investment
will be restrained by the lagged effects of the UK recession.
Companies from both countries, but particularly the Japanese, said the UK's
failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty and the perception that the country
was in the second tier of a two-speed Europe would have some negative effect
on investment.
About 40 per cent of investors said that if the UK withdrew from the EC and
the single market it would have a 'major negative effect' on investment.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Pit strike ballots start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL leaders of mining unions yesterday predicted a close vote in strike
ballots starting tonight. British Coal managers said industrial action would
cut redundancy benefits and damage customer confidence.
Members of the National Union of Mineworkers have rejected a series of
strike calls from their leadership since the 1984-5 pits dispute, but some
local officials expressed optimism that the latest call would be heeded.
The strike vote, called because of impending job losses and privatisation,
is being held tonight and tomorrow among members of the National Union of
Mineworkers and the Nacods pit deputies' union.
British Coal said 7,379 miners had left the industry since the corporation
announced plans last October to close 31 pits. Some 33,300 remain, and the
corporation said all the threatened pits had enough staff to continue
operations if required.
Union leaders traditionally exaggerate the strength of their members'
militancy in the run-up to ballots.
British Coal nevertheless acknowledges that the vote may be close this time
because miners feel they have public opinion behind them.
Mr Ted Millward, NUM secretary at Maltby, South Yorkshire, site of one of
the 31 threatened pits, said the feeling among his members was that 'if we
vote 'no' the union is going to get smashed to pieces'. He added:
'Nationally there will not be much in it, perhaps 53 per cent to 47 per
cent, but we think it will be 'yes'.'
Mr Alan Cummings, secretary at Easington, Durham, said the mood for strikes
had grown recently because 'no one thinks there is anything to lose'. Branch
officials in Scotland and Wales said the ballot was too close to call.
Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal's employee relations director, warned yesterday
that industrial action could 'only lose the public support that had made
possible the current review of the prospects of maintaining a larger market
for coal'.
Union officials said British Coal had been less vociferous than usual in
urging men to vote against the strikes.
The RMT transport union is also holding a strike ballot tomorrow. Although
RMT officials have been co-ordinating their disruption plans with the two
coal unions they were anxious yesterday to insist the cause of their dispute
was quite different to that of the mining industry.
The union wants a pledge from British Rail that if any job cuts are
announced as a result of BR privatisation, there will be no compulsory
redundancies or contracting out of employment.
The result of the miners' ballots is expected on Sunday. The RMT ballot will
not be known for about a fortnight.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Minister warns on order for carrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JONATHAN Aitken, the defence procurement minister (above left) yesterday
visited Swan Hunter to see work in progress at the Tyneside shipbuilder.
The future of the group, which has a blank order book after 1994, is
dependent on its bid for a Ministry of Defence helicopter carrier - a Pounds
170m order which may be shelved because of financial pressures on the
defence budget.
Mr Aitken warned that a final decision depended on available resources.
A decision will be made by the autumn. Without the order Swan Hunter, now
reducing its workforce by 1,400 to 2,200, may close.
Campaigning by management, unions and Tyneside MPs has left ministers well
aware of the impact that the closure of Swan Hunter would have on Tyneside's
economy and morale.
Speaking during Mr Aitken's visit, joint group chief executive Mr Alex Marsh
said the order was an 'absolutely critical contract' for the company, which
has spent Pounds 1.5m on its bid.
He denied that the government could have helped Swan Hunter more in its
fight for overseas orders. But he said it was of great concern that the
project could be withdrawn so late in the tendering process. Such a move
would spell 'all sorts of disasters' for the group and for Tyneside.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Treasury ahead of deficit schedule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is well ahead of its schedule for financing this year's
budget deficit, a Treasury report stated yesterday.
The monthly monetary report said the public sector borrowing requirement was
overfunded by Pounds 9.6bn by the end of January. The overfunding was almost
entirely explained by intervention to support the pound before its departure
from the European exchange rate mechanism in September.
However, the financial year runs until the end of March, so it is too early
to judge how overfunded the authorities will be at the start of the next one
in April. The government is expected to have to finance a PSBR of about
Pounds 50bn in 1993-94.
The report also pointed out that the surprise public sector budget surplus
in January was due partly to higher value added tax receipts, which have
been temporarily distorted by the reintroduction of postponed accounting for
VAT.
Elsewhere in the report, the Treasury underlined prospects for an economic
recovery this year, pointing out that UK retail sales remain on an upward
trend and that output expectations have improved.
"Retail sales rose strongly in January, more than recovering December's
unexpected fall,' said the report. It added that 'UK demand and activity in
late 1992 appear to have been, if anything, a little stronger than the
Autumn Statement forecast assumed'.
Although the report reiterates the government's optimistic view on inflation
 -pointing to the sharp fall in retail price inflation in January, and a
recent fall in pay settlements - it acknowledges the first signs that
sterling's devaluation is feeding through to prices.
The Treasury notes that output prices in the latest three months increased
at a slightly faster rate than in the three months ending in December.
The Treasury argues that the sharp rise in M0 in January and February
appeared to be overstating the strength of the economy while the weakness of
M4 may reflect the shift of funds into other assets.
The report, the last before the Budget on March 16, provided no new
statistics on the state of the economy and although no conclusions were
drawn, the evidence appeared to underline prospects for an economic recovery
this year.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major hints at blaming Thatcher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday said that he had disagreed with a central component
of government economic thinking under his predecessor Lady Thatcher - that
service industries mattered more than manufacturing.
The prime minister said that his belief in the importance of manufacturing
had been 'a minority view' in the 1980s - even though he was a Treasury
minister during the Thatcher years and was favoured by the former prime
minister as her successor.
His comments appeared to suggest that he believes some of the blame for the
current economic recession should lie with his Lady Thatcher. Mr Major
added: 'I am not a minority view now and, anyway, I am in a better position
to expound my views.'
The remarks, in an interview with The Independent newspaper, mark a further
substantial distancing by the prime minister from his predecessor's economic
policies.
Under Mrs Thatcher the Treasury put the greatest emphasis on the service
industry as the engine of economic growth, while manufacturing production
declined in relative importance.
But asked in his interview whether he believed the argument that the service
sector should be emphasised, Mr Major said: 'I don't agree with it. I didn't
agree with it in the 80s.'
The prime minister said that a 'different attitude' was needed to industry
and commerce and that Britain undervalued engineering skills. If Britain did
not remain at the leading edge of technology 'we will not grow and thrive
throughout the 90s. So we have to change our attitudes.'

   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR is expected today to underline his commitment to a more
meritocratic society with a Commons announcement on reform of the royal
honours system, Philip Stephens writes.
The changes will signal an end to the automatic and carefully graduated
award to Whitehall officials of honours from the Order of the British Empire
to a knighthood.
The armed forces, meanwhile, are thought to have agreed that medals
recognising gallantry by individual soldiers, sailors and airmen should no
longer be differentiated according to the rank of the recipient. Generals,
admirals and vice-marshals on the forces' active list may also have to give
up their automatic knighthood.
Mr Major plans also to merge the British Empire Medal - the traditional mark
of royal recognition for service to the community by members of the working
class - with the award of Member of the British Empire.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories face further Maastricht
wrangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE threat of fresh internal wrangling within the Conservative party over
Maastricht looms over the government today when the committee stage debate
on the treaty returns to the Commons.
As the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties tabled fresh amendments on
Maastricht's social chapter, the government yesterday faced pressure to get
tough with rebel backbenchers amid mounting frustration among pro-treaty
ministers and MPs at the slow progress of the bill.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, again tried to rally the party by
warning that Britain's influence in the Community would 'go down the
plughole' if the treaty was not ratified.
Pro-European Tories are divided on how to tackle the rebels. Some believe
the ever-present danger of ambush by a combined Labour, Liberal Democrat and
Tory rebel opposition means party managers have no option but to tread
softly or face defeat.
Others argue that it is time to threaten sanctions against the rebels,
possibly including withdrawing the whip.
Evidence of the schism is set to surface when the 18-strong executive of the
1922 committee meets to discuss last week's confrontation in which loyalists
launched a fierce and probably pre-planned verbal barrage against those
seeking to frustrate the bill.
However, Sir Marcus Fox, 1922 chairman, has indicated to colleagues he is
highly reluctant to polarise the back benches when the number of rebels
appears to be rising.
Meanwhile, Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, is expected to rule today
on whether a Labour backbencher's wrecking amendment can be heard.
He will also have to rule soon on the new Labour and Liberal Democrat
amendments which would, if passed, require the government to sign up to the
social chapter within 30 days of the Maastricht legislation coming into
effect.
It is unclear if the amendments will be ruled 'in order' by Mr Morris - and
whether Tory Euro-sceptics would support them if they are not seen as
'wrecking' amendments.
Manoeuvrings over the bill will resume tonight. Government whips must decide
whether to risk a vote for a late sitting to accelerate the bill or retreat
in the face of possible defeat. Last week, the whips had to use the
procedural device of refusing to supply tellers for a vote to minimise the
impact of a defeat after their numbers failed to add up.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shake-up of teacher training starts
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will today take a first step towards a wide-ranging shake-up
of Britain's system for training teachers by announcing a trial scheme of
'teaching schools' as an alternative to teacher training institutes.
The Pounds 1m pilot - likened to the system of teaching hospitals for
training doctors - is intended by ministers as precursor of reforms aimed at
reducing the role of conventional university and college courses in favour
of more classroom-based experience in schools.
The schools involved in the pilot will train teachers themselves and receive
funding direct from the government which they will then be able to use to
'buy' services from the training institutes.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, envisages eventually a nationwide
network of primary and secondary schools offering to train teachers. The
government has already increased the proportion of time trainee teachers
spend in the classroom during their training. The move has been backed by Mr
John Major.
Schools involved in the pilot will include both those under local authority
control and grant-maintained schools. Ministers are likely to argue that the
pressure for change has come from the schools themselves who want more
control over the training of teachers.
Currently the training of primary school teachers is closely tied to courses
at colleges and universities. and has been attacked by the right of the
Conservative party. Ministers believe existing teaching training courses
remain too theoretical and have failed to adapt sufficiently to the national
curriculum and regular testing.
Legislation on teacher training in the next session of parliament was not
being ruled out last night by Department of Education officials, although
further changes are likely to depend on the department's consultative
exercise.
As the government's Education Bill - with more than 260 clauses the biggest
education measure ever introduced - was given a third reading by a
government majority of 30 (282-252) in the Commons last night, Mr Patten
said that schools controlled by local education authorities are to be given
the right to decide on a year-to-year basis whether to seek self-governing
status.

<TEXT>
MINISTERS are trying to dispel expectations that the exercise of 'taking
stock' of the constitutional position of Scotland will lead to radical
changes.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, told MPs yesterday that there would be
nothing in the government's proposals to undermine the integrity of the
United Kingdom or Scotland's place in it.
Other ministers have been hinting privately at a 'minimalist' solution. One
of the main elements will be greater use of the Scottish grand committee -
made up of all 72 Scottish MPs - for handling Scottish business in the
Commons.
The deal is also likely to include more administrative devolution from
Whitehall to the Scottish office. It is due to be considered by the cabinet
today and to be announced by Mr Lang next week.
Ministers for other departments who were involved in the exercise have been
highlighting the danger of an 'English backlash' if the government were seen
to be conceding too much to the Scottish lobby, particularly since the
Tories' 11 of the 72 Scottish seats is a much higher total than was
predicted.
It is already clear that the government's proposals fall far short of what
the opposition parties are pressing for.
The Scottish Office is considering the controversial step of putting its
proposals for local government and the Scottish water industry into a single
bill next session to help ease pressure on the government's legislative
programme.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Senior officer tells MPs RAF hopes
voluntary redundancies will meet manpower reductions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS DEMONSTRATORS protested at Westminster yesterday against Royal Air Force
plans to scrap one of the last Vulcan bombers, a senior RAF officer told MPs
the service hopes to reach its target for manpower reductions through
further voluntary redundancies, David White writes.
Air Vice-Marshal Tony Bagnall, assistant chief of the air staff, told the
Commons defence committee that a second tranche of redundancies was under
discussion but that the RAF hoped to achieve its requirements 'without
resorting to compulsory redundancies'. He described as 'alarmist' reports
suggesting that many senior officers were facing dismissal.
Under plans drawn up by the government two years ago, RAF personnel are due
to be cut to from 89,000 to 75,000 by 1995. Cuts in support services could
reduce this level still further. An initial redundancy plan affecting 969
jobs was oversubscribed by applicants.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE constituencies of at least 19 government ministers would be among those
to suffer knock-on effects from the closure or running down of Leyland Daf
plants in Britain, Labour alleges today.
Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, says a dossier of
Leyland Daf's suppliers he has obtained shows that 6,000 companies - one in
every 150 - would be hit if Leyland Daf 'went under'.
'If any Conservative MP thought that Leyland Daf was not their problem, this
shows they had better think again,' he said.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Political Notebook: A dangerous by-election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By-elections do not count. All governments are vulnerable to protest votes.
The shock waves last no more than a day or so. Seats lost in mid-term are
almost invariably won back at the following general election.
Already in the bars of Westminster senior Conservatives are arming
themselves against the possibility that the Tory stronghold of Newbury will
be the scene of Mr John Major's first electoral defeat of the present
parliament.
The untimely death last month of Mrs Judith Chaplin robbed the prime
minister both of a good friend and of one of his most able back-bench MPs.
No-one doubts that she would have been among the first of last year's new
intake to be given a job in government. The resulting by-election is
threatening to prove as politically wounding to the prime minister as her
death was personally painful.
His party remains in turmoil. The recession and the civil war over
Maastricht have drained morale.
Loyalist MPs and ministers are increasingly frustrated by the government's
inability or unwillingness to take on the Euro-sceptics. But veiled threats
of expulsion from the party whips appear only to solidify the rebels'
detachment.
Among the 40 or so implacable Tory opponents of Maastricht there are perhaps
a dozen who would see the prime minister fall rather than back the treaty.
There are mutterings still that if the rebels fail to derail the bill by
voting for the social chapter they might yet support an anti-Maastricht
candidate in Newbury.
Friends as well as enemies judge the authority of Mr Major's government to
be as weak as any since Mr James Callaghan's ill-fated Labour administration
in the late 1970s. The prime minister has been heard to comment ruefully
that the now Lord Callaghan has confided that it is easier to govern with a
majority of one than with 21.
Newbury is by any standards a prosperous constituency, one of the principal
beneficiaries of the 1980s boom along the M4 corridor. It is no accident
perhaps that the constituency's biggest employer is a supplier of mobile
phones.
But now it offers a microcosm of the ravages of Britain's first middle-class
recession. As one minister explained this week, to visit Newbury is to
understand why the government is so unpopular with its own natural
supporters.
If an unemployment rate of 7.5 per cent remains well below the national
average, the number of people out of work has trebled since 1990. The crime
rate has almost doubled. The house price slump has left thousands of
once-confident aspirants to the Tory good life trapped by negative equity.
It is not certain that the Tories will lose. It would take a hefty swing of
just over 9 per cent to the Liberal Democrats - the only serious challengers
in the constituency - to overturn Mrs Chaplin's 12,357 majority. Even in
times of crisis loyalty to the Conservatives runs deep in Berkshire.
Strategists at Conservative central office are drawing comfort from the fact
that during each of the last three parliaments the party has survived its
first by-election challenge.
Labour's expected but unimaginative refusal yesterday to withdraw from the
contest (it won only 6 per cent of the vote in 1992) raised hopes that a
split opposition once again would give the Conservatives victory.
But Mr Major is in no hurry to test favourable precedents. Fresher in his
mind are the 25 per cent and 12.5 per cent swings to the Liberal Democrats
in Ribble Valley and in Kincardine and Deeside during his first year in
Downing Street. In Newbury the Liberal Democrats are firmly entrenched in
the council and will field a strong local candidate.
So most Conservatives assume that the poll will be postponed until May 6 to
coincide with the local authority elections. The assumption is that is
better to get the bad news from both out of the way on the same day. Some,
though, are suggesting that Mr Major should wait until the last possible
moment in late June before facing the electors.
By then his party may have escaped from the debilitating limbo of
Maastricht. By then the economy may have escaped from the worst of the
recession. By then his government may have escaped from its present
paralysis.
Mr Major must hope so. It may be that through the prism of history,
by-election defeats appear frequently as insignificant dots on the political
landscape. But it never feels like that at the time. This prime minister
cannot afford to lose.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Peers prepare for battle on leases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY PEERS have begun drawing clear battle lines for the revolt next week
against the government's plans for leasehold reform by tabling amendments to
the bill aimed at restricting the proposals.
The plans, which would give about 750,000 holders of long leases the
possibility of buying the freehold of their properties provided they meet
certain conditions, have already led to high-profile disaffection among Tory
peers, most notably the decision by the Duke of Westminster to leave the
party.
Two worries for the government are that the amendments have gained some
support from independent peers on the cross-benches as well as from some
Tory rebels, and that those Tories who have taken the lead in tabling
amendments so far are not the great landowners but party loyalists,
including former ministers. Lord Peyton of Yeovil, a former minister, has
put down amendments which would make it more difficult for tenants in blocks
of flats to meet the criteria for clubbing together to buy the freehold, by
raising from two thirds to three quarters the majority needed before the
purchase can proceed.
Lord Boardman, another former minister, and Lord Clark of Kempston, a former
MP nominated by the government as a working peer last summer, have put down
a measure to restrict the eligibility for buying the freehold to tenants for
whom the leasehold property has been the main or sole place of residence for
the past three years.
The bill will return to the Lords next Tuesday, and the leasehold reforms
will dominate the beginning of its discussion.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Unionists increase pressure over coal vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland's Unionist MPs are heightening the government's dilemma
over Britain's coal industry by hinting strongly that their reaction to
ministers' proposals will depend on whether special help is given to the
province, Ralph Atkins writes.
The votes of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs and three Democratic Unionist MPs
could be crucial to win Commons approval for the proposals to be set out by
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
The two unionist parties made clear yesterday that they are anxious to help
Northern Ireland's electricity users. MPs from the parties have already met
Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister.
'We will be looking at the impact of the government's energy review on the
whole of the UK,' said one Ulster Unionist MP.
Northern Ireland MPs complain that large electricity users in the province
face charges up to 25 per cent higher than on the mainland. When MPs voted
on the proposed pit closures in October, the DUP voted with Labour and the
Ulster Unionist abstained - but only after a government assurance that its
energy review would include Northern Ireland.
The MPs could demand financial support for the proposed electricity
inter-connector with Scotland, although the government is already backing an
application for a European Community subsidy for the project.
Unionists also want to boost the local lignite industry, perhaps by being
awarded contracts for electricity generation.

Questioning the Scottish secretary yesterday, Mr Alex Salmond, the Scottish
National party leader, said there was a world of difference between
increasing the powers of Scotland and increasing ministerial patronage.
Mr Tom Clarke, the shadow Scottish secretary, said Labour would introduce a
bill to submit Scotland's constitutional position to a referendum if the
government did not 'consult the people.'
There was a clear majority among Scottish MPs for a separate Scottish
parliament, he said.
No matter how well-supported among opposition parties such a bill would be,
however, it has no prospect of becoming law without government backing.
The Scottish Office is considering the controversial step of putting its
proposals for local government and the Scottish water industry into a single
bill next session to help ease pressure on the government's legislative

FT  04 MAR 93 / Miner's leaders predict close vote over strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL leaders of mining unions yesterday predicted a close vote in strike
ballots starting tonight. British Coal managers said industrial action would
cut redundancy benefits and damage customer confidence.
The miners are being asked to back one 24-hour strike followed by a 'rolling
programme of industrial action'. Members of the National Union of
Mineworkers have rejected a series of strike calls from their leadership
since the 1984-5 pits dispute, but some local officials expressed optimism
that the latest call would be heeded.
The strike vote, called because of impending job losses and privatisation,
is being held among members of the National Union of Mineworkers and the
Nacods pit deputies' union.
Union leaders traditionally exaggerate the strength of their members'
militancy in the run-up to ballots. British Coal nevertheless acknowledges
that the vote may be close this time because miners feel they have public
opinion behind them.
Mr Ted Millward, NUM secretary at Maltby, South Yorkshire, one of the 31
threatened pits, said the feeling among his members was that 'if we vote
'no' the union is going to get smashed to pieces'.
British Coal said 7,379 miners had left the industry since the corporation
announced plans last October to close 31 pits. Some 33,300 remain, and the
corporation said all the threatened pits had enough staff to continue
operations if required.
The RMT transport union is also holding a strike ballot today and tomorrow.
Although RMT officials have been co-ordinating their disruption plans with
the two coal unions they were anxious yesterday to insist that the cause of
their dispute was quite different to that of the miners.
The result of the miners' ballots is expected on Sunday. The RMT result will
not be known for about a fortnight.
Northern Ireland's Unionist MPs are heightening the government's dilemma
over Britain's coal industry by hinting strongly that their reaction to
ministers' proposals will depend on whether special help is given to the
province.
The votes of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs and three Democratic Unionist MPs
could be crucial to win Commons approval for the proposals.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Changes urged in regulation rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SYSTEM of investor protection introduced by the 1986 Financial Services
Act is failing small investors, according to a report by Justice, the
all-party law reform pressure group.
The system is unnecessarily complex, incoherent and not easily
comprehensible, Justice says.
The root of the problem lies in the nature of the system itself with its
fragmented regulatory organisations and the inevitable confusion in the mind
of the small investor.
Acronyms of the self-regulatory organisations such as Lautro, Fimbra and
Imro 'have the ring of biblical incantations and are likely to be
incomprehensible to the small investor', the report says.
Lautro regulates the life insurance and unit trust industry, Fimbra is
responsible for financial advisers and money brokers and Imro handles
investment management.
Justice says that at best the fact that a financial services company is
'authorised' by one of these bodies may 'lull the investor and his advisers
into a sense of security that the investment is safe and sound'.
The proposal to set up a Personal Investment Authority for all retail
financial services designed to absorb Lautro and Fimbra must be welcomed as
'a major step towards the improvement of the system', the report says.
But it adds that it is doubtful whether the system will ever be effective in
eliminating fraud and dishonesty. The time is ripe for a more objective and
independent assessment of the self-regulatory system.
Justice calls for:
Simplification of the system and greater consumer representation on the
Securities and Investment Board and the other regulatory bodies;
The higher levels of compensation to be increased and backed by an
independent financial services ombudsman;
Stricter standards of financial advertising;
Personal liability for directors of investment business companies;
Uniform protection throughout the European Community.

The Department of Employment said senior management structures had been

that transfer to rail wagons for the long-distance section of their journey.
The proposals hope to arrest the decline of rail freight by encouraging
so-called combined transport operations which use a combination of road and
rail to get goods to their destination.
Although combined transport has made headway on the Continent, it has had
little success in Britain because typical freight journeys are too short to
justify the handling costs of switching loads from road to rail and back.
The government hopes a weight concession will encourage greater use of
combined transport in Britain, particularly at a time when the Channel
tunnel is about to open up much longer freight routes to the Continent.
British Rail was yesterday committed for trial after an accident in which 25
people were injured. BR representatives appeared before magistrates in Leeds
charged with two counts of failing to ensure safety on May 22 last year.

banks and building societies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Securities and Investments Board is determined that a new regulatory
body for retail financial services should include all sectors of the
industry including banks and building societies, Mr Andrew Large, SIB
chairman, said yesterday, Norma Cohen writes.
The proposed Personal Investment Authority should 'act as the front line
regulator for the sale of life insurance and life insurance related
product,' regardless of which outlet is selling those products, Mr Large
said.
He also urged the life insurance industry to abandon its complaint that full
disclosure of charges was too difficult. The new authority should be an
appropriate vehicle for disclosure issues to be decisively resolved.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Lotus wins Taiwan order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROUP LOTUS, the Norfolk-based sports car and engineering concern, has won a
contract to help develop car engine production in Taiwan.
The contract, which the company yesterday said is backed by the Taiwanese
government and would be worth 'quite a few millions' over several years, may
make more difficult a decision by General Motors on whether to sell Lotus.
GM has owned Lotus since 1987.
Several interested parties have approached GM about the purchase of all or
parts of Group Lotus, including a management team led by Mr Adrian Palmer,
the managing director. GM has not disclosed details of the other approaches,
which followed a decision last year to abandon production of the Elan small
sports car after less than two years. Lotus had hoped to sell 3,000 a year
but the car was widely regarded as too expensive and never came close to
sales targets.
As a result Lotus Cars, the carmaking division which now produces only the
very low volume Esprit 'supercar', has been making heavy losses for the past
two years. It now employs only 200 people - one third of 1991 levels.
Lotus Engineering, the consultancy division which has won the Taiwan
contract, earned more than Pounds 30m in 1991 and is understood to have made
substantial profits last year, although figures have yet to be released.
The division is now substantially larger than the carmaking side of the
business, with 500 employees.
The Taiwanese deal involves technology transfer by Lotus to the Taiwan
government-backed Industrial Technology Research Institute.

FT  04 MAR 93 / North attracts advice shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DISPROPORTIONATE number of the government's new one-stop business advice
centres may be located in the Midlands and north of England if the spread of
partnerships applying to run them is reflected in contract awards.
These areas are well represented among the 57 applications received by the
Department of Trade and Industry. The response in the south and the
south-west has been weaker.
Most of the partnerships are led by Training and Enterprise Councils, the
employer-led bodies which deliver government training schemes in England and
Wales.
Interviews to select 15 pilot outlets, announced last December by Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, will begin shortly.
Mr Heseltine hopes the shops, which will eventually number 200, will
revolutionise support for British companies.
The outlets will bring together the business services of chambers of
commerce, local authorities, local enterprise agencies and the DTI.
Mr Heseltine has allocated Pounds 3.5m for the 'one stop shops' from the
Tecs' budgets and the government hopes the services, many of which are now
free, will be charged for.
Mr Heseltine was asked in the Commons last year whether the pilots would be
spread to represent regions of high business failures. He replied that the
basis for choosing the successful bids would be 'one of quality'.
'It is critical that the 15 are seen as pace setters, even if that results
in districts that might have the most immediate need having to wait for a
period,' Mr Heseltine added.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Law reform group says system failing investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SYSTEM of investor protection introduced by the 1986 Financial Services
Act is failing small investors, according to a report by Justice, the
all-party law reform pressure group.
The system is unnecessarily complex, incoherent and not easily
comprehensible, Justice says.
The root of the problem lies in the nature of the system itself with its
fragmented regulatory organisations and the inevitable confusion in the mind
of the small investor.
Acronyms of the self-regulatory organisations such as Lautro, Fimbra and
Imro 'have the ring of biblical incantations and are likely to be
incomprehensible to the small investor', the report says.
Lautro regulates the life insurance and unit trust industry, Fimbra is
responsible for financial advisers and money brokers and Imro handles
investment management.
At best the fact that a financial services company is 'authorised' by one of
these bodies may 'lull the investor and his advisers into a sense of
security that the investment is safe and sound,' the report adds.
The proposal to set up a Personal Investment Authority for all retail
financial services designed to absorb Lautro and Fimbra must be welcomed as
'a major step towards the improvement of the system', Justice says.
But it adds that it is doubtful whether the system will ever be effective in
eliminating fraud and dishonesty. The time is ripe for a more objective and
independent assessment of the self-regulatory system.
'It is short-sighted to stagger from one modification of one part of the
system to another without considering the efficacy of the system as a
whole,' the pressure group says.
Its report outlines four minimum requirements for protecting small
investors: access to reliable expert advice; honest, accurate information
about products and reliable advertising and promotional literature; quick,
effective compensation if things go wrong; and, a comprehensive but clear
regulatory structure.
Justice calls for:
Simplification of the system and greater consumer representation on the
Securities and Investment Board and the other regulatory bodies;
Higher levels of compensation to be increased and backed by an independent
financial services ombudsman;
Stricter standards of financial advertising;
Personal liability for directors of investment business companies;
Uniform protection throughout the European Community.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Pension investment benefited trustees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two former pension fund trustees of the Universal Computers Group, now
in receivership, invested more than half the scheme's assets in a company
which paid them nearly Pounds 90,000 in fees and dividends and granted them
interest-free loans with no set repayment date.
UCG is the parent company of Ferrari Holdings, the Stock Exchange listed
computer services company which went into receivership in July 1990. The two
trustees, Mr Raymond Frederick Lewis and Mr Robert Woodland, were directors
of UCG. Neither of the two men was authorised to conduct investment business
in the UK.
The company which received the largest single investment is an investment
company, Giltpeak plc, in which the pension scheme invested Pounds 512,000
of its Pounds 562,000 capital. The company was incorporated on July 27 1990
and did not begin trading until nearly six months later.
Giltpeak, whose address is the same as the home address of Mr Woodland, also
paid Pounds 22,855 to Mr Woodland's wife for furniture, fixtures and
fittings, say the audited accounts for the year ended December 31 1991, the
only year for which accounts are available.
The accounts show that at year-end Mr Woodland and Mr Lewis had outstanding
loans of Pounds 14,404 and Pounds 15,936, which had peaked during the year
at Pounds 32,004 and Pounds 61,806 respectively. The accounts say the loans
pay no interest and have no set repayment date.
The accounts also show that the company had total turnover for the year of
Pounds 223,722 and profits of Pounds 41,363, of which Pounds 40,000 were
spent on dividends on common shares.
Although the pension scheme provided almost all the financing for Giltpeak,
it has no voting shares. Instead, it holds preference shares which pay
interest at 10 per cent per year and are redeemable in three tranches
beginning with a Pounds 170,000 payment at the end of this month.
According to the pension scheme's current trustees, GM Benefit Consultants,
appointed by the High Court in December 1992, the two men dismissed the
former trustee, actuarial consultants Noble Lowndes, a month before the
company went into receivership in July 1990. They then removed the scheme's
professional fund managers, London and Manchester (Managed Funds) Ltd, and
directed the scheme's investments into companies in which one or both men
were directors.
Mr Ray Coles, partner at GMBC, the current trustees, said that the pension
scheme has been receiving dividends on its Giltpeak preference shares.

TELETAS, Turkey's second largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer
in which Alcatel of France has a 39 per cent stake, has formed a joint
venture to install digital public exchanges in Uzbekistan, the latest move
by Turkish telecom companies into the Turkic-speaking former Soviet
republics.
The joint venture between Teletas and Algorithim, a local Uzbek company,
will start delivering Alcatel's System-12 public exchange, which Teletas
makes under licence in Turkey. The project will initially install 70,000
lines in eight Uzbek cities, eventually leading to full manufacture of the
exchange by Altel, the joint venture company.
The deal follows similar moves by Netas, Northern Telecom of Canada's
majority-owned Turkish subsidiary, and Simtel the local Siemens operation.
Progress has been spurred by a Dollars 25m (Pounds 17.6m) Turkish government
aid project to provide digital public exchanges in all five Turkish-speaking
former Soviet republics. Teletas installed a 2,500 line exchange in both
Tashkent,the Uzbek capital and Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan.
Teletas say they hope also to manufacture the Levent, a small rural
switching system, designed in the company's Istanbul laboratory.

FT  04 MAR 93 / World Trade News: White House to back US chip makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is ready to take a tough stand on the
long-running semiconductor trade dispute with Japan, Mr Ronald Brown,
commerce secretary, told US semiconductor industry executives visiting
Washington this week for their annual caucus.
'When every market in the world, outside Japan, prefers your products, I
have to conclude that we are facing unfair trading barriers. We expect Japan
to live up to its agreements,' Mr Brown told members of the Semiconductor
Industry Association, who gave him a standing ovation.
Under a 1991 trade agreement between the US and Japan, the Japanese
government recognised US 'expectations' that the foreign share of the
Japanese semiconductor market should rise to at least 20 per cent by the end
of 1992. The pact was an extension of a similar 1985 agreement.
Since 1991, the foreign chip maker's market share in Japan has crept upward,
reaching almost 16 per cent in the third quarter of 1992. Data for the
fourth and final quarter of the period covered by the agreement is expected
in about two weeks.
However, the industry expects the market share figure, upon which Japan's
compliance with the market opening agreement is measured, to rise. Strong
sales of US-made microprocessors in the growing Japanese personal computer
market may boost the fourth quarter figure by more than 1 per cent.
Disputes over how market share should be measured, including whether the
internal transfer 'sales' of IBM and other US computer companies to their
Japanese subsidiaries should be counted in the trade data, might bring the
disputed market share figure within range of its target.
This has created a dilemma for the US chip makers, who for the first time in
their decade-long trade battle find that they have friends in the White
House.
In the past, the SIA has seldom hesitated to raise the spectre of trade
sanctions against Japan. Now, however, the industry seems hesitant to push
the Clinton administration into applying sanctions that would inevitably be
seen as the beginning of a 'trade war' with Japan.
There is no question, however, that the industry will demand sanctions if
the market share figure falls short of expectations. The industry group
already has a list of proposed Japanese import targets. The group was
encouraged by Mr Brown's remarks.
'A few years back, unfair trading practices in the Far East almost destroyed
the American semiconductor industry. It took harsh action to end Japanese
dumping. We must be prepared to act again - in Japan or any other market,'
Mr Brown said in reference to trade sanctions imposed by President Reagan
against Japan in 1986 when Japan was deemed to have failed to live up to the
original US-Japan semiconductor deal.
'We expect Japan to live up to its agreements. I will work closely with you
to evaluate their performance against the objectives of our agreements. We
want to ensure that the Japanese market is open so that we can achieve a
market share commensurate with our worldwide competitive position.'
Mr Brown also assured the semiconductor industry group that the Clinton
administration will continue to fund Sematech, the semiconductor industry
consortium that for the past five years has received half its annual budget
from the Pentagon's Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, over the
occasional objections of Bush administration officials, and the remaining
half from industry members. Sematech is a model for the Clinton
administration's technology policy, Mr Brown said.

FT  04 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japan rejects liquid crystal display
ruling - US trade body decides imports are harming domestic industry
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DECISION by the US International Trade Commission that Japanese-made
liquid crystal displays are being dumped in the US has dismayed Japanese
authorities and industry. They say they will seek a fair decision.
US computer manufacturers, too, have protested at the ruling.
The ITC ruled on Tuesday that Japanese-made active matrix LCDs 'materially
injure or threaten injury to the US industry', and decided to retain
punitive duties of 62.67 per cent.
An official at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry called
the decision 'extremely unfair'. Japan had claimed that there was no US
industry to be hurt by imports of active-matrix LCDs.
Sharp, a leading Japanese manufacturer, released an official statement
deeply regretting the ITC's decision which, it said, raised many questions -
from the point of view of US users as well. 'We will continue to work
towards a fair judgment,' the company said.
In the US, Apple Computer said the ruling made no sense and vowed to
continue the legal battle. 'This is an 'Alice in Wonderland' decision. It
defies logic,' said Mr Jim Burger, Apple's director of government affairs.
The ruling upholds part of a dumping petition filed in 1990 by the Advanced
Display Manufacturers of America and its member companies. That petition led
to a ruling by the ITC the following year that Japanese-made LCDs harmed US
industry.
However, the ITC ruled at the same time that electroluminescent LCDs were
not harming US industry and that it would withdraw anti-dumping tariffs of 7
per cent.
At the time of the original anti-dumping petition, US users of active matrix
displays opposed the ITC ruling on the grounds that no US maker could
mass-produce active matrix LCD panels.
US users, which are dependent on Japanese manufacturers of these panels,
went to the US-based Court of International Trade, which last year ordered
the ITC to re-examine the case.
In seeking to reverse the ruling, Japan could resort to an appeal to the
Court of International Trade or ask the Gatt to set up a panel.
LCD flat panels, which are widely used in laptop and notebook computers and
medical equipment, are one of the most promising growth areas in
electronics.

FT  04 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Irish plan to boost exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government is planning to increase exports from indigenous Irish
companies by 50 per cent over the next four years, from IPounds 3.7bn
(Pounds 3.8bn) to IPounds 5.5bn, with growth coming in particular from the
mainland European market.
Mr Charlie McCreevy, the trade and tourism minister, said: 'I see the main
growth opportunities coming from continental European markets as Irish
industry accelerates its diversification from its traditional UK market.'
The government is to provide an additional IPounds 12m in finance over the
next three years, to enable exporting companies to increase their full-time
sales forces working in Europe, to take on additional customer support staff
with business and language skills and to part-finance 10 new group marketing
schemes.
Mr Conor McCarthy, Irish Trade Board chairman, said: 'We have an urgent need
to build stronger market positions in mainland Europe. . . the sterling
depreciation in September put Irish manufacturers in difficulty, not just in
Britain, but right across our whole market-place spectrum.'
He said that the 10 per cent devaluation of the punt in January 'does not
represent a return to the status quo'. He pointed out that the proportion of
Ireland's trade affected by the weakness of sterling is greater than at
first estimated because of the pricing in sterling of many transactions with
the Middle East, Africa and the Far East. Around 31 per cent of Ireland's
exports go to the UK.
Despite such difficulties, the board says Ireland has continued to gain
share in most of its main markets during 1992.

SUN Microsystems, the California-based manufacturer of computer workstations
and peripheral devices run on the Unix operating system, is to set up a new
software subsidiary in Ireland.
Called Sunsoft, it will open in Dublin this summer and will eventually
employ 200 people, developing and localising software specifically for Sun's
systems sold in Europe. That market accounts for some 30 per cent of its
worldwide hardware sales.
Sun is a market leader in 'open systems' workstations. Demand for these has
grown rapidly over the past two years, as the trend by users to 'downsize'
from mainframes has accelerated.
The development of complex and powerful new software for multimedia
applications is seen by the industry as vital to the development of the
workstation market.
Sun's move into Ireland has been welcome news for the government, following
the announcement last week by Digital Equipment, another US workstation
manufacturer, that it is to consolidate its European manufacturing in
Scotland, with the loss of 780 jobs in Ireland.
Mr Ruari Quinn, Ireland's enterprise and employment minister, said the Sun
decision 'demonstrates clearly that Ireland has the edge when it comes to
software development expertise'.

FT  04 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Trading with purpose - Kevin Brown looks
at Australia's promotion effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO trade promotion organisations boost exports by improving access to
overseas markets or do they impose a bureaucratic barrier between businesses
and potential customers? Under pressure to improve performance and cut
costs, the Australian Trade Commission (Austrade) is trying to find out.
Austrade was set up in 1986 to combine several government organisations in a
'one stop shop' to provide assistance to Australia's export effort. But a
1991 review by McKinsey, the management consultants, suggested the
experiment had failed. McKinsey found the organisation bureaucratic, top
heavy and unfocused. Its report said Austrade was failing to justify its
ADollars 127m (Pounds 60.40m) budget, and concluded that changes would be
required to justify its continued existence.
Mr Ralph Evans, chief executive since July 1991, says the points made in the
McKinsey report have been absorbed. Many staff have been relocated overseas
to increase direct contacts in overseas markets. More managers, including Mr
Evans himself, are being recruited from the private sector. And resources
are being diverted from 'easy' markets such as the UK and US to 'difficult'
countries in Asia and Eastern Europe, where McKinsey thought Austrade could
provide services that companies were unlikely to establish for themselves.
Austrade is also paying increasing attention to the Asia/Pacific region,
which most forecasters expect to play an increasingly important role in
Australian trade. The run-down of activities in Australia and other
English-speaking countries has helped provide resources to increase
representation in Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore, Jakarta, India, Bangkok,
and Vladivostok, in Russia's resource-rich Far East which was still closed
to most foreigners less than two years ago.
Operations in Japan, by far the most important of Australia's trading
partners, have been boosted by four regional offices to support the main
representation in Tokyo and Osaka.
Mr Evans says his goal is to make Austrade as much like a private company as
possible. 'We are trying to encourage a culture of enterprise that is
oriented towards results, towards actually making a bit of difference to
Australia's export business,' he says.
Austrade representatives used to spend much of their time compiling economic
statistics and marketing Australia as a whole. Now they are encouraged to
bring buyers and sellers together and organise, for example, flexible credit
terms for cash-starved buyers in newly-liberalised economies. Sometimes
trade commissioners have played an important role in spotting opportunities
for Australian companies, and finding partners in big contracts.
There have been some successes. The Beijing office spotted an opportunity to
develop an air traffic control system for 50 Chinese airports, and helped
find a local joint venture partner for AWA, the Australian electronics
group, which subsequently won the contract against stiff competition.
In Hungary, Mr John Charody, a trade commissioner recruited from the private
sector, helped put together a series of agreements under which Australian
companies will supply thousands of games machines, and set up a national
lottery and a chain of computerised betting offices.
McKinsey suggested that Austrade had played a 'worthwhile' role in exports
valued at ADollars 3.5bn over three years, and argued that the total could
be improved. But assessing the impact of trade promotion is more difficult
than adding up the value of goods or services sold. Trade promotion
organisations have relied on indirect indicators such as the number of trade
displays or the number of meetings facilitated by representatives. But such
indicators reveal little or nothing about the amount of business which gets
done.
The alternative approach being adopted by Austrade is to assess the value in
terms of sales or contracts of efforts on behalf of specific companies. But
as Mr Evans points out: 'We have got to set up some criteria. . . to decide
whether we have helped a lot in specific cases, or just at the margins.'
Austrade has commissioned an independent investigation to cross-check the
results with the companies. Also, exporters will be asked whether they are
getting good value from Austrade's offices.

FT  04 MAR 93 / British threat over Californian tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A HUNDRED British MPs from all parties will ask their government today to
trigger retaliation against US companies if the long-running dispute over
California's method of taxing foreign companies is not satisfactorily
resolved by the end of the year.
Barclays Bank, whose suit is being treated as the test case for California's
system of world-wide unitary taxation, is near the final round in its
10-year legal battle against the tax, as it seeks to persuade the US Supreme
Court to declare the method unconstitutional.
British MPs flew to Washington this week to try to convince the Clinton
administration to throw its weight behind the Barclays appeal, and to make
clear that their threats of retaliation were real.
'I don't see what else we could do if the courts failed us,' said Mr
Nicholas Brown, a UK Labour party spokesman on economic affairs.
'It is a new situation. Retaliation is not the taboo word it was a year
ago,' added Sir Roger Moate, Conservative party MP for Faversham.
California's unitary system seeks to tax foreign companies' world-wide
profits in proportion to their business operations within the state, instead
of the usual method of taxing only profits generated in the state.
Barclays won decisions against the method in Californian superior and
appeals courts. With the backing of the British government and the US
Justice Department, the UK bank had argued that unitary taxation infringed
the federal government's constitutional power to conduct foreign policy and
regulate foreign commerce.
However, these decisions were overruled by the Californian Supreme Court
last year, and the US Supreme Court declined to review. Barclays is now
seeking, for the second time, to have the US Supreme Court take up the case,
after further action in the state courts.
British officials are watching anxiously to see whether the Clinton
administration will follow its predecessors by joining the suit.
The UK parliament passed a measure to enable the UK government to retaliate
against US companies in 1985, but this has never been implemented.
Mr Dan Burt, of the Washington law firm Burt, Maner &amp; Miller, argues that
the UK's threats of retaliation will not be believed until they are
triggered.
Also, retaliation would improve Barclays chances in court by demonstrating
that the California tax does interfere with foreign commerce.

TRADE UNIONS in Trinidad and Tobago are hoping a planned general strike will
force the embattled government to cancel the sacking of thousands of workers
from three state-owned utilities.
The strike will compound the problems of Mr Patrick Manning, the prime
minister, in keeping the struggling oil-based economy from foundering. The
date for the strike is being kept secret by the unions. 'We are not going to
indicate any date,' said Mr Errol McLeod, president of the National Trade
Union Centre, an umbrella for organised labour.
'We wish only to announce that a general strike is very much in the offing
if there is no softening of the government's position and if there is no
adjustment to their economic programme.'
Thousands of government workers protested in the streets last month after Mr
Wendell Mottley, the finance minister, said extensive retrenchment in the
public sector was inevitable.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN banks have lowered their prime lending rate by a quarter point to
6.25 per cent, in response to big capital inflows and an accommodating
monetary policy.
The new level, which matches the lowest of the past 20 years, takes effect
today and has been accompanied by a sharp rise in the Canadian dollar. The
currency climbed above 80 US cents this week for the first time since
November, and advanced yesterday morning to 80.35 US cents, despite the
prime cut.
The Bank of Canada said yesterday that intervention to contain the rise of
the currency resulted in a net increase of USDollars 636m (Pounds 447.8m) in
its foreign currency reserves in February.
Nervousness in the financial markets about Canada's economic and political
prospects was evident during the referendum last autumn on a new
constitution. Then, banks pushed their prime rate as high as 9.75 per cent.
However, investors have since been drawn by attractive yields on Canadian
securities.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Mexico party finance offer causes furore
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) celebrates its 64th
consecutive year in power today, embroiled in a growing furore over its
financing.
The controversy has arisen over claims, first reported in El Economista
newspaper, that about 30 of the country's richest businessmen had each
promised to give the PRI some Dollars 25m (Pounds 17.6m) to strengthen the
party's finances before the presidential election next year.
The pledges are reported to have been made at a dinner party last week in
the house of Mr Antonio Ortiz Mena, former finance minister, which was
attended by President Carlos Salinas. Mr Ortiz Mena this week said of the
meeting: 'There were people who said their group could give more, and others
who said they could give less.'
He stressed that the money pledged would go to a trust fund that would
enable the PRI to stay independent of the government. The businessmen
pledged to give on a large scale because the PRI offered the best guarantee
of their investments, he said. Other groups, including labour unions, would
also be contributing to the trust fund.
President Salinas last year promised to make the party's finances more
transparent, and to put caps on campaign spending. The party finance reform,
still to be debated by Congress, is meant to address the huge financial
advantages the PRI has enjoyed over Mexico's impoverished opposition
parties, and thus prepare the way for more open, competitive elections.
Mr Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a leader of the opposition Party of Democratic
Revolution, said of the donations: 'This does nothing but lay bare the
obvious - the oligarchic nature of the party and its collusion with the
country's great fortunes.'
The list of guests at the dinner party reads like a who's who of Mexican
business. Among those present were Mr Emilio Azcarraga, the president of
Televisa, Mexico's near-monopoly television station; Mr Carlos Slim,
president of Telefonos de Mexico, the recently privatised telephone
monopoly; Mr Roberto Hernandez, president of Banamex, Mexico's largest, and
recently privatised, bank; Mr Lorenzo Zambrano, head of Cemex, the huge
cement company; Mr Bernardo Garza Sada from Alfa, the conglomerate; and Mr
Adrian Sada from Vitro, the monopoly glass company.
Don Fidel Velazquez, Mexico's nonagenarian labour leader, showed irritation
with suggestions that the PRI was abandoning the labour sector by soliciting
money from the business sector. He said Dollars 25m did not appear to be a
very large sum, and that he was willing to give the party even more.

VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez, speaking from a palace still
scarred by a recent coup attempt, said the country's political woes would
not turn him into a lame duck in his last months in office and he expected
Congress to approve all pending economic reforms, Reuter reports from
Caracas.
The president said on Tuesday that tax bills critical to attacking a growing
budget deficit in this oil-rich nation were likely to be approved this month
and other reformist legislation would be passed before December general
elections.
Mr Perez, 70, who cannot by law seek re-election, acknowledged that he has
felt isolated for scrapping popular subsidies and introducing austerity
policies, but he said he was undeterred even by two attempts by rebel troops
to topple him last year.

TRADE UNIONS in Trinidad and Tobago are hoping a planned general strike will

The strike will compound the problems of Mr Patrick Manning, the prime

acceptable agreement.

only to announce that a general strike is very much in the offing if there

to their economic programme, some of the effects of which we have already
begun to witness.'
Thousands of government workers protested in the streets last month after Mr
Wendell Mottley, the finance minister, said extensive retrenchment in the
public sector was inevitable. About 3,000 workers are to be sacked.
Mr Mottley said the cuts at the Public Transport Corporation, the Port
Authority and the Water and Sewerage Authority were unavoidable because of
their huge payrolls, falling international oil prices which were affecting
the domestic economy, and a heavy foreign debt obligations.
The government has indicated that it cannot continue financing the deficits
of the three companies while meeting overdue payments to government
employees and servicing the country's foreign debt.
Mr Mottley said the cumulative loss by the three companies last year was
TTDollars 342m (Dollars 80m). The government is also under pressure to pay
TTDollars 3bn in arrears to its workers. The country's domestic debt has
increased by 62 per cent in the last five years to TTDollars 5.2bn, while
the country's foreign debt is TTDollars 5.8bn. The government has to pay
TTDollars 2.8bn this year in servicing its foreign debt.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Perot under attack at congressional hearing: Senator
sound-bites back at the Texan billionaire gadfly over his knowledge of US
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DARING to criticise Mr Ross Perot is reckoned to be a risky political
business these days. Early on Tuesday evening, however, Senator Harry Reid
decided to buck the odds.
The billionaire from Texas, now almost as ubiquitous as he was when running
as an independent in the presidential election campaign last year, had
invited himself to Capitol Hill to testify (lecture was a more accurate
description) before Congress on the iniquitous ways of the perk-ridden
legislators and foreign lobbyists who were conspiring to export American
jobs world-wide.
Warming to his task and flanked by a crowd of cheering acolytes, Mr Perot
also laid into the Clinton administration, about which he had been
relatively kind, accusing it of incompetent mathematics and 'sound bite'
salesmanship.
His particular beef was that the president's energy policy advisers were a
bunch of 'poets, philosophers and beekeepers', none of whom had ever 'met a
payroll' or created a job in all of their working lives.
Mr Reid is the Democratic senator from Nevada. He is not reckoned a great
power in Congress but, whereas his peers had alternately taken Mr Perot's
punches on the chin and fawned over him, the senator decided that he had had
enough.
'Ross, I like you a lot,' Mr Reid tactfully began. 'But, in your statement
here, you gave us 45 minutes of sound bites and five minutes of detail.'
Worse, Mr Perot had demeaned Mr Mack McLarty, the White House chief of
staff, who was indeed from 'corporate America, just like you,' and from the
energy sector no less.
He then accused Mr Perot of completely misunderstanding the structural
nature of the US budget deficit and the caps on federal spending embodied in
the 1990 Budget Act.
'I think you should start checking your facts a little more and stop
listening to the applause so much,' the senator admonished.
Encouraged by Mr Reid's resolution, several other heavyweight senators then
presumed to suggest that Mr Perot's views were not always infused by
knowledge.
Mr Perot does not like being contradicted, especially in front of his flock.
In one widely remarked incident last year, on his favourite morning
television show, he had come close to losing his temper with a little old
lady from Florida who bravely confessed she had not understood his answer to
her question on social security.
This time, before the legislators, he bristled and blustered, and hinted
darkly that Mr McLarty's tenure as chief executive of Arkla, the natural gas
concern, was marked by 'problems'.
But, in the end, he backed off, said Mr McLarty was 'a fine man', and came
as close as he ever does to issuing an apology.
'I regret that anything came up where people had to fall on their swords to
defend him,' the Texan billionaire said.
Mr Perot then retreated, a little bruised but not bowed, to an evening
television talk show, where his reception was far more amenable and where he
again laid into Congress and everybody else in Washington with his customary
verve.
Mr Reid, meanwhile, found himself in the unaccustomed media limelight as the
man who had dared to take on Ross Perot.

However, investors have since been drawn by attractive yields on Canadian
securities and a perception that the country's problems may be less severe
than those of many other industrial nations. Canadian borrowers have been
among this year's most active Euromarkets participants.
Economists expect the prime rate to fall to at least 6 per cent and perhaps
lower. But they caution that markets could be unsettled in coming months.
The spring federal and provincial budget season is likely to see
unexpectedly large budget deficits, which are widely recognised as Canada's
most pressing economic problem. In addition, political uncertainty may rise
again during the run-up to the general election, expected in the autumn.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Gore to hunt down waste and fraud in government agencies
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VICE-PRESIDENT Al Gore is to take charge of a six-month review of every
government agency to find ways of cutting waste and fraud. He promised
'significant savings' from the review, which he said would start 'a
revolution in government right here and now'.
President Bill Clinton, announcing the review, said elimination of waste
would be 'a breath of fresh air for American taxpayers', who would be
treated in future as customers by government agencies.
Bureaucratic waste has been a favourite target for US political candidates,
and Mr Clinton promised in his campaign last year to cut 100,000 unnecessary
federal government jobs and to achieve 3 per cent administrative savings in
every government agency.
The Gore audit is modelled on a state government performance review carried
out in Texas in 1991. That came up with 975 suggestions on ways to save up
to Dollars 4.2bn from a state budget of around Dollars 30bn.
The state legislature adopted Dollars 2.4bn of these savings, helping to
fill a budget deficit and avert the introduction of a state income tax for
the first time in Texan history.
Some of the suggested cuts, however, aimed at programmes that were not
necessarily unadulterated waste. One idea was to double the cost of tuition
at state colleges.
Like the Texas review, the Gore audit will set up a toll-free telephone
number to gather suggestions from the public. It will provide an important
task for Mr Gore, who has taken the lead in discussions of the
administration's environmental and technology policies but who, like many
vice-presidents before him, runs the risk of appearing under-employed.

AFGHANISTAN'S two main warring rivals have agreed on a peace formula that
should allow the arch enemies to share power in Kabul, officials said,
Reuter reports from Islamabad.
Under the draft accord, reachedin Islamabad and yet to be agreed by the
other main mujahideen parties, President Burhanuddin Rabbani remains in
power for several months, while Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, chief of the
hardline Hezb-i-Islami party, becomes prime minister.
'Engineer Hekmatyar is ready to take up the post of prime minister and if
there are no objections by the other groups we see no difficulty,' Mr
Rabbani's spokesman, said. A few small differences remained, he said.
Mr Rabbani was insisting on recognition of the assembly of nationwide
delegates that last December elected him as president for the next two years
but conceded to Mr Hekmatyar's demand for general elections before his term
expired.
Mr Hekmatyar has accused Mr Rabbani of rigging his election and subjected
Kabul to a fierce bombardment to back his demand the president step down.
More than 1,000 people were killed and 6,000 injured in Hekmatyar's last
assault on Kabul.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Budget buoys Hong Kong stock market

<TEXT>
STEEP cuts in taxation and higher spending on social programmes and public
works were provided for in the annual budget presented by the Hong Kong
government yesterday.
Mr Hamish Macleod, the colony's financial secretary, said Hong Kong's gross
domestic product, adjusted for inflation, would rise this year by 5.5 per
cent compared with 5 per cent last year. Inflation is expected to hover just
below 10 per cent.
His budget cheered the stock market which ended the day 11 points away from
its all-time high of 6,447, reached on November 12 last year. The market was
also encouraged by signs that Britain and China were edging closer to an
agreement to talk about Hong Kong's political development.
Yesterday Governor Chris Patten announced that he would delay a visit to
Japan so he could make a statement on the state of Anglo-Chinese talks about
Hong Kong.
Mr Patten will address the Legislative Council, LegCo, the colony's law
making body, tomorrow where he also is expected to explain why the
government has delayed publishing legislation that would give effect to his
proposals for wider democracy in the colony.
Mr Macleod described his budget as one which 'built on success'. He
confidently forecast that Hong Kong would overtake Britain and Australia in
terms of income per head this year and praised local businessmen for their
ability to look 'beyond present political controversies' to the colony's
long-term prospects.
His budget was, however, unashamedly populist and designed to ensure a
smooth passage through LegCo. More money was allocated for social security,
housing, health and education. Tax allowances were over-indexed by twice the
rate of inflation and the threshold at which income tax becomes payable was
raised.
Mr Macleod left the corporate tax rate unchanged at 17.5 per cent. He cut
the rate of stamp duty on stock market transactions to 0.3 per cent from 0.4
per cent - at a cost of HKDollars 800m (Pounds 72m) to the revenue. He said
that he would look sympathetically on further reductions in stamp duty.
He also decided to bring forward a big roads programme. Tomorrow it will
call for expressions of interest from the private sector to build a road
linking Hong Kong's container port with the city of Shenzhen, which lies on
the colony's northern border.
This project involves the construction of a bridge and tunnel and would, by
1997, provide a direct road link from China's most productive regional
economy to Hong Kong's modern port. Mr Macleod earmarked HKDollars 4bn for
the government's contribution to the project.
The combined effect of these and other measures is forecast to produce a
budget deficit of nearly HKDollars 3.6bn for the 1993/94 fiscal year - the
first deficit the Hong Kong government has forecast since the mid-1980s -
and compares with an estimated budget surplus of HKDollars 20.5bn for
1992/93.
This was up from an initial forecast of just HKDollars 7.5bn made a year
ago. A combination of buoyant tax receipts and under spending by the Hong
Kong government on public works were equally responsible for the higher
surplus.
In his medium-term outlook for the government's finances, Mr Macleod
forecast continued budget deficits. These were due primarily to the building
of a new airport and associated projects which, if completed on schedule,
would be income producing by the time China resumed sovereignty of Hong
Kong, he said.
According to the projection, by 1997 the Hong Kong government's accumulated
budget surplus should be more than HKDollars 78bn - well ahead of the
HKDollars 25bn which Britain has agreed with China.

FT  04 MAR 93 / S Korea may free interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea's new government yesterday indicated it might deregulate a large
portion of interest rates this month in a key step toward financial reform.
The action would fulfil a promise by the previous administration that the
latest phase of interest rate deregulation would occur in the first half of
this year.
The government's tight control of lending and deposit rates has been blamed
for distorting credit allocation and causing market interest rates to be
higher than those of South Korea's main Asian competitors.
Seoul agreed in 1991 to deregulate interest rates in four stages by 1997 in
response to US trade pressure that it open up its financial market. The
second phase to be implemented this year would free 75 per cent of bank
lending rates and 30 per cent of deposit rates.
It would also completely liberalise lending rates among other financial
institutions, such as short-term finance companies and insurance companies,
and deregulate 65 per cent of their deposit rates. But officials have
hesitated to free rates because they fear it would cause painful adjustments
to the financial system, including a temporary jump in interest rates.
A similar attempt at deregulation in 1988 caused interest rates to rise
sharply as borrowing expanded to finance property speculation. The
government scrapped the reform and put strict limits on property
transactions.
Mr Hong Jae-hyong, finance minister, said yesterday the fall in market
interest rates since last autumn had improved prospects for deregulation to
be managed without significant disruption. Market rates now stand at 11 per
cent against a peak 19 per cent early last year. A cut in the central bank's
key lending rates in January helped push down market rates.
One concern is that corporate demand for loans usually rises in the spring
as companies increase spending on facilities and equipment. The government
wants to encourage corporate investment spending this year to help revive
the economy, which grew by some 4.5 per cent last year, the lowest rate
since 1980.
The finance minister also said yesterday that a schedule to introduce a
'real name' financial transactions system, promised since 1981, would be
unveiled by May. Financial accounts can at present be held under pseudonyms
and have been used to hide money generated by Korea's underground economy.
Introduction of 'real name' accounts would help fight corruption, a move
that is in line with the aims of President Kim Young-sam.
Share prices on the Seoul exchange have fallen recently, because of fears
the 'real name' system would drain liquidity from the market.

industrial sector

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S state-dominated industrial sector last year registered losses of
about Dollars 76bn (Pounds 53bn), much the same as the year before,
according to the State Statistical Bureau, Tony Walker reports from Beijing.
The military, tobacco, coal-mining and petroleum sectors accounted for the
biggest losses. These sectors tend to be most heavily burdened by rigid
pricing policies and by overmanning.
Faltering state-owned enterprises accounted for 80 per cent of losses in
industry, with the light manufacturing sector hardest hit, the statistical
bureau reported.
Heavy industry fared slightly better, because of heightened demand for
products such as steel due to a construction boom. China's economy grew more
than 12 per cent last year.
Losses in the military sector were attributed to shrinking demand. Heavy
investment in industry over the past few years appears to have yielded only
limited improvements in efficiency.
China's shrinking state sector accounted for about 50 per cent of industrial
output last year. In 1978, at the outset of the 'open door' reforms, it
produced 78 per cent of total industrial output.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Westinghouse to face trial in US
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPPINE negotiations with Westinghouse Electric of the US for an
out-of-court settlement on a bribery charge in the construction of a nuclear
power plant have collapsed, paving the way for a trial at a US court.
Philippine negotiators yesterday said they 'did not believe' that the latest
Westinghouse proposal for a settlement 'would provide substantial benefit to
the country'.
They declined to divulge details.
The trial is set to start on March 15 at the New Jersey federal court and
could take about two months.
The case was filed in December 1988 by the Philippine government and the
state-run National Power Corporation (Napocor), owner of the nuclear plant,
which alleged that Westinghouse and Burns and Roe, a US consultant to
Westinghouse, had in 1973 bribed the late President Ferdinand Marcos, to win
the contract.
The 620MW plant was constructed on the Bataan Peninsula, 60km north-west of
Manila, at a cost of Dollars 2.1bn.
Mr Marcos was ousted in a popular uprising in 1986 and the government of Mrs
Corazon Aquino mothballed the plant and initiated the court suit.
The Philippine government alleged that Westinghouse and Burns and Roe
illegally obtained their contracts by bribing Mr Marcos through Mr Herminio
Disini, a Marcos relative.
The government had also claimed that the plant was unsafe and inoperable
because of allegedly defective design, construction and testing. It is
seeking Dollars 26.5m (Pounds 18m) in actual damages and an unspecified
amount for punitive damages.
On the eve of the original trial in March 1992, the two sides came up with a
provisional out-of-court settlement that involved Westinghouse payments to
the Philippines of Dollars 100m in cash and cash equivalent to repair and
upgrade the plant to current safety standards.
In return, Westinghouse was supposed to be granted a licence to operate the
plant for 30 years, selling electricity to Napocor at a pre-set price.
Subsequent negotiations, however, failed to resolve the price at which the
output from the Bataan plant will be purchased by Napocor, according to
Manila officials.
The freeze on the nuclear plant had left the Philippines with a severe
shortage of electric-power generating capacity.

FT  04 MAR 93 / What's good for Shanghai is good for China: Zhang Tingting
on the role of a city that provides a sixth of the country's budget revenues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ZHANG TINGTING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHANGHAI has long been regarded as the engine of growth for China's economy.
But as the country has experimented with market policies, the city's massive
state-run industries have held back its growth.
Shanghai is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on projects such as Pudong,
a planned industrial estate the size of Shanghai itself.
The city remains the largest contributor to national budget revenues,
providing a sixth of the total - 10 times the amount contributed by fast
developing Guangdong province. But it has lost its position as the largest
regional economy to Jiangsu province.
Shanghai has long embraced reform - its previous mayor was Zhu Rongji, now
leading the national economic reform programme as vice-premier - but the
preponderance of large state-run industries, with outdated products, excess
labour and lack of management autonomy, has produced huge challenges.
By contrast, industry in Guangdong province, where the 'open-door' policies
were first introduced with the creation of special economic zones, has been
able to grow from a small base on greenfield sites and has employed what was
previously a mainly rural population.
Shanghai is China's industrial centre. It is so interwoven with other parts
of the country that almost every move it makes to reform affects the
national economy not least because its industries rely heavily on energy and
raw materials from other provinces. The initial impact of the transition to
a market economy was to divert from them at least 60 per cent of the energy
and raw materials which had been provided under central planning.
In 1988, the city found itself with only a few days' coal reserves. The
government, which had previously fixed all coal prices, had begun to free
them. The immediate result, however, was chaos in supplies. The partial
liberation made it hard for Shanghai to find fuel for its industries in
competition with manufacturing enterprises throughout China, including those
not run directly by the state, which queued up to bid for a share.
Meanwhile, the local state-run textile industry, the biggest hard currency
earner, was on the verge of bankruptcy because of new competition from
township enterprises in neighbouring Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.
Township enterprises, which mushroomed in the mid-1980s as a result of
market reforms, usually outperform their state-run counterparts because they
have advantages in flexibility of pricing, distribution and the right to
hire and fire.
Shanghai's 940 large- and medium-sized state-run enterprises, by contrast,
have had little impetus to grow because of old-fashioned inefficient
management with no answers to the intense competition.
However, the development of Pudong, a 350sq km area - larger than China's
four special economic zones together - offers the chance to renew Shanghai's
industrial base. The project is expected to take 30 to 50 years and to cost
at least Dollars 10bn (Pounds 7bn).
Premier Li Peng has called the Pudong project 'the focus of China's efforts
to attract foreign investment in the current decade'.
Of three special zones within the area, one - Waigaoqiao - allows foreign
investors to re-export for the first time since the communists took power in
1949. C. Itoh, the Japanese trading house, was the first to set up there.
The other zones are for export processing and financial services.
To finance the development, Beijing will help Shanghai raise 4bn yuan
(Pounds 475m) a year through Pudong construction bonds. It will also sell
shares in state-run companies on domestic and overseas markets, provide
state funding and low-interest loans, and try to revive state-run
enterprises by various means including granting them the right to import and
export.
According to Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, the 45.5bn yuan needed in the first
five years of development (1991-1995) has been secured and is being spent on
capital infrastructure projects such as bridges, roads, telecommunications
facilities as well as water, power and gas plants.
To attract investors, the mayor pledged not to change for three years the
low 1991 price of land leases. He promised to complete major capital
construction projects by 1995 and to cut down red tape.
While most western investors waver, domestic investors have been eager.
Anhui province, one of China's leading rural provinces, has committed 1bn
yuan to a capital project to get a firm foothold in Pudong.
However much Pudong is being used as a market laboratory to revitalise
Shanghai, the city will continue to face problems. The authorities are
concerned that higher salaries and better social protection in Pudong will
create a completely different system from that in the rest of Shanghai. They
fear that social and economic stability may be disturbed by a 'one city, two
systems' approach.
State-run enterprises have been converting enthusiastically to the
shareholding system, but the legal and accounting framework is inadequate to
accommodate the rapid changes.
However, reform is progressing quickly. Mayor Huang has said that, in
addition to the national price reforms featuring a free market for grain and
edible oil introduced last year, Shanghai would co-operate with neighbouring
provinces to free prices of some industrial products such as energy and raw
materials. Prices for more than 80 per cent of industrial products in
Shanghai are now determined by demand and supply.
Local government officials say the idea behind these localised reforms is to
attract investment and trade from all parts of the country with a free
market, enhancing Shanghai's position as China's leading trading centre. It
already has a stock exchange and commodities markets. National trade centres
for non-staple food and non-ferrous metals were set up in Shanghai last
year.
Contracts have also been signed for China's first retail joint venture with
a foreign investor, involving the Shanghai No 1 Department Store and Yaohan
International of Japan.
Deng Xiaoping, the 88-year-old paramount leader who is the architect of the
economic reforms, has said that he regretted not having granted Shanghai the
status of special economic zone, as he did to Shenzhen in Guangdong province
10 years ago, 'or Shanghai would have been playing a greater role in the
national economy'. Yet he believes Pudong will overtake Shenzhen in vitality
and contribution to the country's economic future.

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT is to remove curbs barring foreign banks from operating in local
currency, in a move the government hopes will attract substantial new
investment.
The measures, approved at a meeting earlier this week attended by President
Hosni Mubarak and the country's top economic policymakers, will allow the 22
foreign bank branches in Egypt to take deposits and make loans in Egyptian
pounds without requiring changes in the branches' shareholding structure or
legal status.
In practice, the decision would considerably open Egypt's banking market.
'Foreign banks will be able to enter Egypt without any restriction
whatsoever,' one senior local banker said. Mr Atef Obeid, cabinet affairs
minister, said the move aimed to encourage foreign banks to 'make bold
decisions to invest and extend credits'.
A proposed amendment to Egypt's banking law will be put to parliament for
ratification next week. Approval is considered a formality.
Foreign bankers in Cairo welcomed the move, suggesting it could herald
considerable expansion into the domestic retail market by such banks as
Citibank, American Express Bank, Chemical Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit
Suisse and Arab Bank. 'Basically, the move opens up a totally new market,'
one US banker said.
The measure has been resisted strongly by some of Egypt's larger and more
conservative banks. The banking law had previously held that foreign banks
with branches in Egypt should have local partners to be allowed to operate
in local currency.
However, some local bankers welcomed the move, saying it would jolt Egypt's
banks into greater efficiency. 'I welcome foreign competition, provided the
central bank has the capacity to control and monitor the expanded
activities,' Mr Hazem Beblawi, chairman of the Export Development Bank of
Egypt, said.
The decision to liberalise the banking market comes amid steps to boost
growth and impress the IMF and World Bank with Egypt's resolve to expand the
private sector. Last week the bank signed a memorandum of understanding
unfreezing a Dollars 150m structural adjustment loan, after approving
Cairo's plans to speed privatisation of its public sector.

TAIWAN and Britain will establish direct air links on March 29 in a move
expected to benefit trade and tourism, airline officials said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Taipei.
Aircraft flying the route will not carry flags or national insignia because
of political sensitivities.
Britain does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taipei and instead
recognises China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan.
British Asia Airways, a subsidiary of British Airways, will make two round
trips a week between Taipei and London, with a stopover in Hong Kong, Mr
Winston Hsieh, the airline's Taipei manager, said.
Eva Airways, Taiwan's second international airline and part of the Evergreen
shipping group, said it would make three trips a week with stopovers in
Bangkok and Vienna.
Taiwan has struggled to set up direct air links with other countries because
of its rivalry with China. The island's growing economic power has helped it
establish services with several nations in the past two years.
Taiwanese made about 50,000 trips to Britain last year, up from 35,000 the
previous year, Britain's representative office in Taiwan said.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Balance of payments worsens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ITALY'S overall balance of payments in January registered a deficit of
L765bn (Pounds 349m), compared with a L566bn deficit during the same period
in 1992, writes Robert Graham.
The deficit reflected movement in the current account which was in the red
to the tune of L5,169bn. In contrast, capital movements registered a surplus
of L4,603bn. This was largely due to an upsurge of foreign investment
totalling L6,163bn.
Portfolio investment accounted for L5,497bn, compared with a mere L47bn in
January 1992.
These inflows were only partially offset by L2,736bn of Italian capital
going abroad. Significantly the latter outflows were down on the same period
in 1992 when they totalled L7,535bn.
The country's foreign currency reserves stood at L37,966bn at the end of
January, compared with last September's low of L20,801bn during the currency
crisis.

<TEXT>
A STRING of road building contracts throughout Italy were yesterday brought
within the scope of corruption investigations, leading to the arrest of
businessmen, officials of Anas, the state roads authority, and Mr Gerardo
Pelosi, director-general at the Ministry of Public Works.
As the scope of corruption investigations continued to broaden, parliament
delayed a decision on waiving immunity on Mr Bettino Craxi, the former
Socialist leader. The delay was caused by new evidence which parliament
wished to study. This centred on allegations made by Mr Claudio Martelli,
the former justice minister and one-time political associate of Mr Craxi,
that the latter had been involved in collecting illicit contributions for
the party.
Magistrates in Rome and several other cities have been investigating for at
least two months the activities of Anas during the 1980s. Road building
accounts for 10 per cent of the annual L30,000bn (Pounds 13.6bn) budget for
public works contracts. Some arrests had already been made, but yesterday's
arrests underscored the extent of the investigation. They involved six Anas
officials and seven businessmen, two of whom have already been caught up in
other public works corruption investigations.
In addition, a further eight Anas officials and three contractors were
warned they were under investigation. The Milan department of Anas was the
most affected but others included Naples, Palermo and Reggio Calabria. The
action taken in the three southern cities is of particular significance
because they cover areas regarded as infiltrated by organised crime and
barely touched by the current wave of corruption investigations. The Anas
board and its officials have been traditionally controlled by the main
ruling parties.
The latest arrests took place against a growing debate among political
parties on the merits of introducing legislation to provide a 'political'
solution to the crisis caused by the corruption scandals. The government has
said it hopes to have legislation ready by tomorrow. But a growing number of
politicians doubt the feasibility of framing legislation that does not
appear to be letting the guilty off the hook.
Last night the Socialist party was still undecided whether to endorse the
waiving of parliamentary immunity in respect of Mr Craxi to face charges of
alleged corruption, extortion and illicit funding.
Matters were complicated by the arrival of new material with potentially
serious allegations made by Mr Martelli, who has been warned he is under
investigation over the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Swiss MPs reject woman as minister

IT WAS no big surprise yesterday when a majority of (male) Swiss
parliamentarians voted down the nomination of Mrs Christiane Brunner to join
the country's seven-person Federal Council (cabinet).
Women have made little headway in Switzerland's senior government and
business circles.
The new cabinet minister this time had to be, like the outgoing foreign
minister, Mr Rene Felber, a Social Democratic party MP from the
French-speaking part of Switzerland. Mrs Brunner, 46, and a trade union
leader, was one of only two MPs to fit this profile and agreed to be a
candidate. She would have been only the second woman minister in Swiss
history.
In spite of being an MP for only 15 months, she won her party's endorsement,
partly because she was a woman and partly because she came from Geneva, a
canton which has not been represented in the cabinet for more than 70 years.
(Geneva was ready to declare a school holiday if she had won.)
But her casual manner and taste in clothes raised eyebrows in the
male-dominated political establishment, as did the fact that she has had
three husbands. After her rejection, women's groups gathered in front of
parliament, threw paint bombs and vowed to continue the tough battle for
equality. Mrs Brunner herself was in no doubt about the meaning of the vote.
'I am disappointed not for myself, but for all women in Switzerland.'

FT  04 MAR 93 / Fiat bruised at crucial time: Arrests have added to the
group's problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, the flag bearer of Italian industry, has begun a delicate damage
limitation exercise to offset the impact on the group of the continued
imprisonment of Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, its chief financial officer.
Mr Mattioli has been held in a Milan jail since February 22 when he was
arrested with Mr Antonio Mosconi, chief executive of Toro, Fiat's insurance
arm, for alleged illicit funding of political parties. They are being
detained in connection with their previous roles on the board of
Cogefar-Impresit, the Turin-based group's construction company.
Last May Mr Enzo Papi, then Cogefar-Impresit's managing director, was
imprisoned for 55 days by Milan magistrates and only released after
confessing to the payment of a L1.8bn (Pounds 785,000) bribe for a Milan
metro contract. Mr Papi, who resigned from Cogefar-Impresit, has been
questioned again in recent days.
Fiat management on Tuesday declared the group's full solidarity for the two
imprisoned executives and called for their fate to be clarified as quickly
as possible. It said it was concerned that 'this judicial affair, because of
the resort to preventive detention and uncontrolled dissemination of
restricted information before any sentence, affects the reputation of these
people and the image of the company at a moment when it is directing all its
energies to provide jobs and be competitive'.
Whatever the outcome of the arrests, Fiat has been bruised at a crucial
time. Mr Guiseppe Turani, Italy's best known writer on corporate affairs,
commented after the arrests: 'Fiat has been hit by Milan magistrates at
perhaps the most delicate moment in its history, or at least during that
period which began almost 30 years ago when the 'Avvocato' (Giovanni
Agnelli) became president.'
The Fiat group, with its core business in the automotive sector, is
confronted by three vital challenges: to produce successful new models; to
forge new international alliances; and to produce an effective management
structure to cope with the departure next year of Mr Agnelli.
The challenges have already increased because of the downturn in Fiat's main
markets and Mr Agnelli's forecasts of a bleak 1993. On top of this, the
group can scarcely afford damage to its reputation or instability in Italy,
which accounts for 44 per cent of car sales, nor lose the services of Mr
Mattioli.
Mr Mattioli, aged 52, has been with Fiat since 1975 and has worked closely
with Mr Cesare Romiti, the group's chief executive. Last November he was
promoted in a management shake-up designed to prepare the way for the
departure of Mr Agnelli who has said he intends to step down in June next
year. He is to be succeeded by his brother Mr Umberto Agnelli.
The management structure was slimmed down and split in effect into two broad
sectors - industry and industrial development under Mr Giorgio Garuzzo and
financial control and resource management under Mr Mattioli.
Mr Garuzzo and Mr Mattioli reported to Mr Romiti who has also hinted he will
step down at about the same time as Mr Agnelli. In Turin Mr Garuzzo and Mr
Mattioli were both tipped as possible successors to Mr Romiti.
In any event Mr Mattioli has had the task of managing resources against
declining profits (forecast for 1992 at half the L1,609bn of 1991) and the
need to find resources to fund investment of L47,000bn during the rest of
the decade.
The prospect of Fiat raising cash by selling some of its non-core activities
such as Rinascente, the stores group, or even Toro insurance and the
Cogefar-Impresit, has helped push Fiat shares up steeply since the beginning
of the year.
Also fuelling the rise have been rumours of talks about a new alliance on
the car side. Last week Mr Agnelli specifically ruled out the Japanese but
was silent about the possibility of a European partner.
The Milan bourse rumour mill says the price is being talked up to make Fiat
shares more attractive for an alliance.
A tie-up with Renault is mentioned. Renault has denied this as it already
has its hands full with Volvo, and Fiat says an alliance now when it is
investing so heavily in new models makes no sense.
But the shares are still rising - despite the impact of the arrests. This
suggests foreign institutional buying of the shares in the belief Fiat will
benefit from devaluation and from its new models due when, as it is hoped,
the market picks up next year.
Fiat will need luck and good management.
The Italian business community is watching closely how long Mr Mattioli is
kept in jail and whether he can emerge unscathed.
As Mr Agnelli put it last week: 'Being caught up with the magistrature is
always worrying.
'It's a bit like being on the operating table - one hopes it will all go
well but there is always a risk.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MILAN magistrates investigating misuse of public funds yesterday ordered
arrests linked to reconstruction work in an alpine valley devastated by
floods six years ago, Reuter reports from Milan.
The magistrates ordered the arrest of two construction company owners and
two officials of the state road-building agency Anas on corruption charges
linked to the 1987 Valtellina disaster.
Fifty-three people were killed when a flood swept away two villages in the
Valtellina, a valley north-east of Milan. Damage was estimated at L3,000bn
(Pounds 1.3bn) and 1,500 people were left homeless in one of Milan's
favourite weekend haunts.
The Italian government set in motion massive reconstruction projects after
the disaster.
In southern Italy, magistrates have revived separate inquiries about
allegations of large-scale fraud over rebuilding work after a 1980
earthquake that killed 3,000 people in the Irpinia region, east of Naples.
Investigations into the Irpinia scandal had made no progress for years
despite a damning parliamentary inquiry led by Italy's current head of
state, Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, then an MP.
The Milan investigations into widespread collusion between politicians and
businessmen, however, have spawned a host of similar inquiries in the rest
of Italy over the last year and once again turned the spotlight on the
Irpinia earthquake.
A former prime minister, Mr Ciriaco De Mita, resigned on Tuesday as the man
charged with revamping Italy's chaotic political system after the Christian
Democrat politician's brother was arrested in connection with alleged fraud
in the Irpinia case.
The parliamentary committee that Mr De Mita chaired yesterday overwhelmingly
rejected his resignation, but the former prime minister asked for more time
to decide his future.
While the scope of corruption investigations continued to broaden, the
Italian parliament delayed a decision on waiving immunity on Mr Bettino
Craxi, the former Socialist leader.
The delay was caused by new evidence which parliament wished to study. This
centred on allegations made by Mr Claudio Martelli, the former justice
minister and one-time political associate of Mr Craxi, that the latter had
personally been involved in collecting illicit contributions for the party.
Magistrates in Rome and several other cities have been investigating for at
least two months the activities of Anas during the 1980s.
Road building accounts for 10 per cent of the annual L30,000bn budget for
public works contracts.
Some arrests had already been made, but yesterday's moves underscored the
extent of the investigation.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK grants for Polish banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN has agreed that its grants to the Polish stabilisation fund,
amounting to Dollars 100m (Pounds 70.4m), should be used to recapitalise the
Polish banking system, Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said
yesterday.
The Polish stabilisation fund was set up in 1990, with a total capital of
Dollars 1bn, from donations and loans from western countries. Its primary
objective was to support the convertibility of the zloty, but it has never
been called upon.
Mr Major, who was speaking after talks in London with Ms Hanna Suchocka, the
Polish prime minister, also said that Britain continued to back
wholeheartedly Poland's eventual membership of the European Community. It
would, however, take a number of years for the Polish economy to become
sufficiently efficient to face the full blast of competition from the EC
members.
Ms Suchocka said she had had a sympathetic hearing from Mr Major for her
request that Poland should be upgraded as a recipient of British export
credits. At the moment cover is available from the Export Credit Guarantee
Department (ECGD) for short-term export credits. But Poland, which feels
that it should no longer be classified among the poorest countries, would
also like to be able to benefit from medium and long-term export credits.
Mr Major said an answer would be given after further talks in the club of
creditors.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Army urges Yeltsin to end deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE top command of the Russian army has urged President Boris Yeltsin to
take 'resolute measures' to end the political deadlock, according to the
daily Izvestia, writes John Lloyd in Moscow. The newspaper reported that
'during a security council meeting chaired by Mr Yeltsin, military
representatives expressed concern on the development of the political crisis
and demanded that the president take resolute measures to end it'.
The deliberate publicity given to this normally closed discussion highlights
the momentum gathering behind a presidential strike against his encircling
opponents in parliament and elsewhere - possibly in the form of a
declaration of an emergency, or of presidential rule.
Mr Anatoly Sliva, deputy head of the president's legal advisory department,
said yesterday the referendum planned for April 11 following an agreement
between the president and parliament in December could not now legally be
cancelled. A meeting, probably next week, of the Congress of People's
Deputies seems certain to repudiate its earlier agreement.
Yesterday, talking to women's groups, Mr Yeltsin said Russia could split
into warring states unless opposing sides ended their differences. He asked
the groups to use their influence to cool tempers.
The governor of Ukraine's central bank announced yesterday that on March 18
he will raise Ukraine's discount rate to 180 per cent as part of the
government's drive to stabilise the Ukrainian economy, writes Chrystia
Freeland in Kiev.
Mr Viktor Iushchenko, appointed to head the National Bank of Ukraine last
month, said that the refinancing rate would be pegged at 90 per cent and
that enterprises unable to pay their debts would be forced into bankruptcy.
'If we do not weed out those enterprises which are dragging us backwards our
economy will never survive,' he said.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Ruhe wants brake on EFA development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR VOLKER RUHE, German defence minister, yesterday called for more drastic
measures to slow down the development programme of the European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA), accusing the aerospace industry of inflexibility in
negotiating savings.
He announced new measures to submit all spending on the project, jointly
carried out with Britain, Italy and Spain, to a new financial control group
in his ministry, saying that plans had previously not been controlled
closely enough.
At the same time he admitted he no longer had adequate funds in his budget
to maintain spending at the current rate on the development programme, and
called for the timetable to be extended by two years.
The four aerospace contractors have submitted their proposals on reducing
the costs of the fighter aircraft, and stretching out the production
programme, in line with a deal agreed by the defence ministers last
December.
What Mr Ruhe now wants, however, appears to be a more drastic slowdown in
the immediate future, possibly requiring lay-offs of research and
engineering personnel involved in the project.
Mr Ruhe was seeking to defend himself in the German parliament against
attacks on two fronts: from supporters of the EFA project in his own
government, who say he has been irresponsible in axing too much money from
the development programme in the current year; and from opponents of the
scheme who want the project scrapped.
He was called to give evidence to the Bundestag defence committee after it
became apparent that the DM520m (Pounds 220.3m) set aside for EFA
development in 1993 would run out, probably by April. The original
allocation of DM820m was cut by DM300m in a late round of budget cuts, since
when it emerged that another DM180m had to be paid for uncovered spending in
1992.
The DM340m left for EFA in the current budget is estimated to be DM600m
short of the likely spending by Deutsche Aerospace, the principal contractor
in Germany. The other companies involved are British Aerospace in the UK,
Alenia in Italy, and Casa in Spain.
Mr Ruhe said the lack of flexibility shown by the aerospace industry, and
the expectations for spending which went far beyond the budget approved by
the Bundestag, would endanger the future of the project. Anyone who wanted
to see the project succeed 'must be ready to hold back in 1993 and 1994, the
most difficult years in the (German) unification process.'
He said Germany remained committed to spending DM5.85bn on the development
phase.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Thousands flee Serbian advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT least 18 people were yesterday reported killed and dozens wounded in
Cerska, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, as thousands of refugees tried
to flee the Serb advance through the region.
The continued fighting came as the US claimed air-drops of relief supplies
had been a success and said that the operation would continue. Last night
Belgrade air traffic controllers said a fourth air-drop had taken place.
A ham radio operator from Konjevic Polje, about seven miles south of Cerska
which was the target of the third air-drop on Tuesday, yesterday said
villagers had found 18 aid pallets in snow about half a metre deep.
Ms Lyndall Sachs, spokeswoman of the Belgrade office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees, said: 'We have reports that Konjevic Polje
is under heavy bombardment by Serbs . . . and on amateur radio we hear they
are coming under tear gas, shells, and small arms fire.'
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, in a letter to President Bill
Clinton, urged the US to abandon the air-drops because they threatened to
ignite a wider war. A Serb mayor in eastern Bosnia also urged the US to stop
the drops, saying land corridors were safer and more efficient.
However, the US administration is convinced that, in spite of the latest
escalation in hostilities, the air-drops have helped to persuade the Bosnian
Serbs to allow through more and bigger ground relief convoys. Eleven UNHCR
lorries yesterday crossed Serb lines to Gorazde, about 100 miles south of
Cerska, carrying 69 tonnes of food and medical supplies.
In a visit to New York that took on enhanced significance because of the
worsening situation, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, met Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali and endorsed the UN secretary-general's views on the
need for the use of force by UN troops to implement any agreement.
Mr Hurd, who also met Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN and European
Community peace negotiators, emphasised that it would be impossible to
impose a military solution in the absence of a negotiated settlement
endorsed by all the warring parties.
The ideas that were taking shape after last Friday's Nato meeting were still
a long way from 'receiving detailed definition,' he added. .
Meanwhile, in a speech in Antwerp yesterday, Mr Hans van den Broek, EC
commissioner responsible for external relations, raised the prospect of the
EC, the US and Russia using joint military force to bring an end to the
conflict. Military intervention might be necessary to uphold a political
settlement based on the Vance-Owen plan, or to impose a solution from the
outside.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Brussels to clear Perrier takeover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is about to approve the takeover of Perrier, the
French mineral water company, by Nestle, the Swiss foods group, write Andrew
Hill in Brussels and Ian Rodger in Zurich.
Brussels' competition authorities signalled yesterday they were broadly
satisfied with the proposed sale of part of Perrier's assets to the French
beverage company Castel for FFr750m (Pounds 94m).
A formal go-ahead will have to wait until the French government, and the
French town of Thonon-les-Bains have approved Castel as the new operator of
the Vichy and Thonon water sources under their control.
The Commission approved the Nestle-Perrier deal last July after a five month
inquiry, but on condition the rights to certain mineral water brands and
springs were sold to a single buyer.
The Commission wants to encourage a new 'third force' on the French mineral
water market, apart from Nestle and BSN, France's biggest food company.
Commission officials said yesterday they did not think the sale of Thonon
and Vichy would pose particular problems.
Under the original deal with Nestle, Castel would have acquired the rights
to Vichy, Thonon and Saint Yorre, but not Pierval, the fourth brand
specified in the Commission's decision last summer. However, under pressure
from Brussels, Nestle persuaded Castel to buy Pierval as well, and announced
an amended deal last week.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Frankfurt draws a discreet veil over extreme right: Local
elections in the state of Hesse will test support for Republicans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANKFURT has been tidied up in preparation for local elections in the state
of Hesse this Sunday. The city authorities have cleared 'Needle Park' in the
banking quarter of drug dealers and their clientele. The homeless have been
shifted out of the main station's shopping galleries.
Unofficial action has ensured that other unsightly elements - the extreme
right - have hardly shown their face. Election meetings on behalf of the
Republicans and German People's Union (DVU) have been confined by public
pressure to backrooms in down-at-heel pubs. Overt signs of their activities
 -posters installed nightly on lamp posts three metres above the streets -
disappear before dawn.
But the result of the vote for 21 district presidencies and 426 local
councils, the only scheduled popularity test for Germany's political parties
this year before the grand slam sequence of local, state, federal and
European elections in 1994, is likely to be an untidy affair.
In the state overall, the Social Democrats (SPD) are expected to sustain
light losses on the 44.5 per cent share of the vote last time in 1989, while
Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) suffer more substantial
reductions from their 33.3 per cent.
The Greens seem set to improve on their 7 per cent overall share won in
1989, mainly because disillusionment with the main parties has prompted a
drift among voters seeking respectable alternatives. These apparently do not
include the Free Democrats, who have been losing ground and appear from most
recent samplings likely to emerge with less than the 4.4 per cent of the
Hesse vote they won in 1989.
But most eyes, in Bonn and abroad, will be focused on Frankfurt. As well as
being the largest city in the state, it is the most crime-ridden and most
cosmopolitan in the country - a quarter of the population is non-German. It
is amply qualified as a political proving ground for the far right.
The weekend election will show the extent to which the Republicans and DVU
have been able to transmit their 'foreigners out' message beyond their
meeting rooms, and the extent to which they may influence the federal
electorate next year.
Opinion surveys in the city have shown the SPD fading sharply and the CDU
gaining on the popular perception that for all their failings in Bonn, the
Christian Democrats are better equipped to deal with the main issues in this
election: a mostly mundane mix of budget management, housing shortages,
traffic bottlenecks and rising crime. At the last count the two main parties
were neck and neck with 35 per cent each among those who had decided how to
vote. This placed the CDU marginally below its 1989 result and SPD down five
percentage points.
Meanwhile, the Greens, the SPD's current coalition partners have gained five
points to reach 15 per cent overall. The Republicans, representing the other
extreme of the spectrum, seem set to win almost 7 per cent of the vote - the
same as the National Party (NPD), their ideological predecessors, in the
1989 election.
The figures suggest that the recent widespread public condemnation of racist
violence, orchestrated candle-lit processions and posters preaching
'Tolerance' on every corner have had some effect on the city's collective
conscience.
But although the issue of asylum-seekers has slipped down the political
agenda and is mentioned by only 6 per cent of voters as an important issue,
the more general 'foreigner problem' (17 per cent) remains inextricably
bound up in local minds with crime (27 per cent).
The final judgment must wait until all the votes have been counted,
including those of the 17 per cent of Frankfurters who say they have yet to
decide which way to vote.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Call for intervention in Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Hans Van den Broek, EC commissioner responsible for external relations,
yesterday raised the prospect of the European Community, the US and Russia
using joint military force to bring an end to the conflict in former
Yugoslavia.
In a speech in Antwerp, Mr van den Broek, formerly Dutch foreign minister,
said the Yugoslav crisis had entered a crucial phase. Military intervention
might be necessary to uphold a political settlement based on the UN-EC
Vance-Owen plan, or to impose a solution from the outside.
'In both scenarios, Europe will face painful choices as to its military
intervention,' said Mr van den Broek, 'I believe that only a united front by
the US, the European Community and Russia offers a chance of forcing the
warring parties to make peace.'
In Brussels yesterday, EC diplomats reacted cautiously to Mr van den Broek's
threat to use force, pointing out that such decisions lay with member
states, rather than the European Commission. Both the UK and France, who
have several thousand troops supporting humanitarian missions in former
Yugoslavia, have voiced reservations about an open-ended commitment to use
force.
A UK diplomat said Mr van den Broek, a long-time hawk on Yugoslavia, was on
'dangerous ground' if he was threatening to impose an outside settlement.
More than 50,000 troops might be needed to broker and enforce a truce. 'He
needs to explain where he is going to get the men and the money.'
The European Commission announced yesterday that the EC was accelerating
disbursement of Ecu60m (Pounds 50m) to help the victims of the war, the
first tranche of an Ecu325m aid package. But Mr Manuel Marin, EC
commissioner responsible for development aid, said he could not guarantee
that the medicine and food would reach those in need. The EC remained
dependent on the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, he said.
Mr Marin said 'all appropriate means' should be used to deliver the aid,
including 'active and hard-hitting measures.' But he recognised that the
ultimate decisions lay with western governments. 'I would not hide that the
war in Yugoslavia has not been the most brilliant page in the history of the
European Community.'

FT  04 MAR 93 / Doubt cast on Bonn's plan for company tax reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS by the German government to overhaul company taxation, to make Germany
more competitive, could have the opposite effect, leading economists and tax
experts warned yesterday.
Far from encouraging investors to come to the country, it was likely to act
as a disincentive, because of sharp cuts proposed in depreciation
allowances, they told a parliamentary inquiry in Bonn.
In addition, the new law could contradict the German constitution, by
discriminating between income tax payers.
Indeed, rather than have an inadequate tax reform, which is supposed to have
no net effect on the government's tax income, the experts suggest that it
would be better to have no reform at all.
The embarrassing evidence for the German government, and for Mr Theo Waigel,
the finance minister, in particular, was presented at a public hearing of
the finance committee of the German Bundestag.
The key element in the plan for a new law on corporate taxation, intended
specifically to improve the competitiveness of Germany as an investment
location - the so-called Standortsicherungsgesetz - is a substantial
reduction in the marginal rate of corporate taxation from more than 50 per
cent to 44 per cent.
Private companies which pay income tax would see the rate come down from 53
to 44 per cent, and public companies paying corporation tax would also be
liable for a marginal rate of 44 per cent, instead of the present 50 per
cent.
However, the plan is intended to have no net effect on the government's tax
revenues - given the current acute budget squeeze to finance spending in
east Germany - and the reduction in overall tax rates is to be financed by
abolition of depreciation and other allowances.
In a report on the tax reforms published to coincide with the hearing, the
Berlin-based German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) said that 'on
balance, it will be precisely those companies intending to invest who will
be penalised by the tax changes.
'For them the advantages offered by the planned reduction in basic tax rates
will frequently be outweighed by the disadvantages resulting from the
worsening of depreciation allowances.'
A series of leading experts in the field of company taxation backed the
argument of the DIW. Professor Joachim Lang, of the Institute for Taxation
Law at the University of Cologne, said that 'to attempt to improve
competitiveness in a way which does not reduce tax revenues is as impossible
as trying to square a circle'.
He suggested that, in particular, foreign investors would be discouraged by
the reforms which would if anything make German tax law more, not less,
complicated.
DIW calculates that particularly in capital intensive industries, like
engineering and the chemical industry, the effect would be negative, while
labour-intensive industries like textiles would benefit. That was scarcely
the intention of the tax reform.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Walkout at Ford after leak of plans to cut 3,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEAKED internal documents from Ford Motor Company revealing plans to close
most of its general services business yesterday led to a walkout at its
Dagenham plant.
According to the documents, leaked by unions at the company, Ford intends to
contract out most of its general services business in a move affecting 3,000
jobs in its British and German plants by the end of the year, in spite of
the risk of industrial conflict.
Service workers at Dagenham staged an unofficial 24-hour strike in protest
and union officials said they were shocked and horrified at the proposals.
The workers involved are employed in the transport of supplies and parts
between Ford plants in the UK and continental Europe as well as maintenance
work, electrical engineering and office administration. The company employs
1,482 service workers in the UK and as many as 1,317 of them would be
affected by the restructuring plan. The company says there will be no
compulsory redundancies.
Ford confirmed the leaked documents were genuine, and said it was studying
how to implement the contracting-out plan, but the outcome could not be
prejudged. It added that it was company policy to use outside specialist
companies where appropriate. Last year, Ford said it was outsourcing its
seat manufacture.
Ford said it needed to cut its costs and could not afford to retain in-house
services when these could be provided more competitively from outside.
In the leaked documents, Ford assesses the strike risks of going ahead with
restructuring general services. It believes 'the most serious risks' lie
with the truck drivers who supply key components to its production plants.
'A British truck fleet dispute would probably result in the progressive
closure of all Ford European manufacturing plants within three days,' the
documents say.
The company calculates that if it decided to reassign or re-source truck
fleet business, it would 'result in a dispute of at least two weeks'
duration' because it would mean a loss of earnings and jobs.
The documents say Ford believes the unions would be 'unlikely to act swiftly
to influence the drivers to end a truck fleet dispute'.
Another danger area for disruption would be boiler operations, where a
strike could halt production quickly, although Ford believes the personnel
concerned 'would be willing to explore re-sourcing and reassignment terms
before reacting'.
Ford has calculated that it would not be possible to stockpile to protect
continental manufacturing plants because of the limited time available. It
also believes there would be 'major difficulties' for management in
maintaining boiler operations.
The documents also suggest the company fears a 'a high risk of significant
disruption' across all general services.
Union officials are due to meet Ford on March 11 to discuss the company's
existing threat of compulsory redundancies in its UK plants.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Bundesbank debates new rate cut: Half-point reduction will
be on policymakers' agenda today despite inflation fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank will today discuss a further 0.5 percentage point cut in
Germany's leading interest rates against a tense background of deepening
recession in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.
Today's discussion follows the weekend meeting in London of finance
ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries at which Germany's trading partners said they would
like an early cut in German rates.
The Frankfurt-based directorate of Germany's central bank is understood to
have put the interest rate cut issue on the agenda for today's regular
council meeting at which it will be joined by the heads of the regional
central banks, who are the main source of pressure for reductions.
Expectations about today's meeting have seesawed since the G7 meeting. Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, initially fuelled hopes of lower
official rates by predicting a slight easing of German money market rates
this week. But the Bundesbank's subsequent money market operations have
suggested no change. Some economists have warned that the Bundesbank may not
act because of continuing fears about inflation.
Until yesterday there had been no sign of the turbulence in the European
exchange rate mechanism which prompted surprise cuts in the discount rate
and the internationally important Lombard rate to 8 per cent and 9 per cent
respectively a month ago.
However, in addition to calls from Germany's partners for a further cut in
interest rates to pull Europe out of recession and boost the world economy,
German domestic factors have come increasingly into play. This week's
industrial production statistics showed output in December and January
almost 7 per cent down on a year earlier.
These figures, Deutsche Bank's new forecast that the economy is heading for
a crash-landing, and a warning yesterday from Mr Ferdinand Piech, head of
Volkswagen, that he was braced for a 'long, massive recession', will tend to
weight the opinions of regional heads in favour of cuts.
However, economists warned that over-reaction - especially in the wake of
last month's abrupt rate reduction - could damage the bank's credibility and
its reputation for guiding events rather than being guided by them.
Mr Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank, admitted that the rate
of decline in industrial output was unprecedented compared with previous
recessions. However, manufacturing accounted for only a third of gross
national product, he said.
He still believed there was a better than 50 per cent chance of recovery
starting this year, based on service industries' growth and the prospect of
rising exports.
'A cut tomorrow could be viewed as giving way to panic in industry,' he
said. Exchange markets had settled now that the downward direction of the
Bundesbank's rates policy was clear. It was probably not necessary for it to
use up more ammunition at present. If further turbulence could be avoided,
there was a 'marvellous opportunity . . . to generate real confidence' after
the French elections this month.
The leaders of Germany's three-party coalition agreed to boost petrol and
diesel taxes from next year to raise revenue for a planned railway reform,
Chancellory Minister Friedrich Bohl said, Reuter reports from Bonn.
He said early today that it had been agreed to seek a motorway user fee
along with the tax increase to raise about DM8bn in annual revenues as of
next year. Coalition leaders had settled on a fuel tax rise of 13 pfennigs
per litre starting in 1994, he said.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK shares reach record high on hopes of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market closed at record highs yesterday as investors gained
confidence that economic recovery may be under way at last.
Helped by Tuesday's higher prices on Wall Street, encouraging UK company
results and hopes that the Bundesbank will cut German interest rates today,
the FT-SE 100 index jumped by 36.3 points to a new closing high of 2,918.6.
The FT-SE mid 250 index also posted a record closing high after a day in
which a healthy 710m shares were traded.
The market took heart from news of a sharp increase in new home sales so far
this year. The Treasury's latest monthly monetary report, published
yesterday, highlighted the upwards trend of retail sales and commented that
demand and activity late last year 'appear to have been, if anything, a
little stronger than assumed' in the government's Autumn Statement of last
year.
However, the patchy and fragile nature of any recovery was underlined by a
Nationwide Building Society report that house prices fell 1.4 per cent in
February and a warning from the Confederation of British Industry that
unemployment is unlikely to fall below 2.25m even after recovery has become
established.
The share price jump coincided with a determined attempt by the government
to talk up prospects for recovery.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, again castigated what he called the
'doom-mongers' attempting to paint a picture of a nation in decline. He
pointed to record exports, rapid growth in productivity and low inflation as
evidence of the underlying strength of the economy.

FT  04 MAR 93 / BA seeks Branson pledge of silence to end dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways is demanding that Mr Richard Branson, head of Virgin
Atlantic Airways, sign a pledge banning him from ever making any public
reference to BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign as part of a final settlement of
their bitter dispute.
Virgin, in turn, is understood to have asked for signed commitments from BA
not to indulge in any further anti-competitive practices.
According to sources close to both sides, the two airlines are refusing, so
far, to yield on these issues but are understood to have agreed in principle
on a Pounds 9m cash compensation offer to Virgin by BA on Monday to settle
the dispute.
As the two sides remained locked in tense negotiations, Sir Colin Marshall,
chairman of BA, and Mr Robert Ayling, the airline's managing director, last
night came under pressure from some MPs at a private meeting of the House of
Commons all-party Aviation Group.
Labour MPs alleged that BA's activities against Virgin had damaged the
reputation of UK civil aviation and demanded assurances that the airline
would never repeat such behaviour.
Mr Ayling renewed BA's assurances that the 'dirty tricks' involved a small
number of incidents and employees.
Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour MP for Hartlepool, dismissed the explanation as
'implausible'.
Pressed by MPs, Sir Colin said any BA activities against Virgin 'had not
been authorised by any director'.
Asked about reports that BA was still conducting covert operations against
Virgin in the US, Mr Ayling said a full investigation into the latest
allegations of passenger poaching was under way.
Sources close to the talks said last night that, unless the outstanding
issues were quickly resolved, the lengthy and difficult negotiations between
the two airlines risked collapse.
Virgin rejected BA's Pounds 9m offer on Tuesday after Mr Branson was asked
to sign a pledge he would remain permanently silent on BA's campaign against
his airline.
Although both sides appear anxious to reach an agreement by the end of this
week, Mr Branson has made it clear he does not intend to be legally bound
never to mention again the events of the past seven years involving BA and
his airline.
Under BA's demands, Mr Branson would be required to consult Sir Colin
Marshall, BA's chairman, before making any statement concerning the
relations between the two airlines. This is understood to be regarded by
Virgin as unacceptable. The commitment would preclude Mr Branson from
referring to the episode in, for instance, an autobiography without BA's
approval.
A Virgin official said last night that 'the lines are still open and
negotiations are continuing' but refused to comment on the issues still
threatening the talks.
But the main stumbling block remains the demand for silence from BA which,
unless resolved in the next 24 hours, could jeopardise a peace settlement.
Mr Branson and Sir Colin first met to try to settle the dispute following
Virgin's libel case victory in January.
Although Virgin won Pounds 610,000 in libel damages from BA and a public
apology, Mr Branson has repeatedly threatened to take further legal action
against BA unless he secured satisfactory compensation for the commercial
damages inflicted on his company by BA's undercover activities.
The proposal to pay Pounds 9m to Mr Branson, including about Pounds 6m in
settlement over a longstanding aircraft maintenance dispute, appears to have
caused dissent among BA board members. Some directors are understood to have
opposed any payment, while others insisted it should be presented as an act
of goodwill rather than as an admission of wrongdoing.

WOOLWORTH, the general merchandise and specialty store retailer, yesterday
reported after-tax profits of Dollars 280m in the 53 weeks to January 30 - a
considerable improvement on the previous year's Dollars 166m loss. Sales in
the full year and the final quarter were flat.
The 1992-3 profits total was free of any one-off accounting-related or
restructuring charges and came after net profits of Dollars 165m in the
final three months.
The 1991-2 figure included an after-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 250m
 -to cover an accelerated store redeployment programme - and an
accounting-related charge of Dollars 113m. The restructuring charge was
taken in the fourth quarter of 1991-2, when the net loss totalled Dollars
128m. Woolworth said sales in 1992-3 reached Dollars 9.96bn, virtually
unchanged. The fourth-quarter sales figure was Dollars 3.13bn.
The full-year and final-quarter revenues from the specialty stores increased
slightly, while general merchandise revenues showed a small decline.
Woolworth noted that sales figures had been depressed by the store closure
programme, al-though it said this had a positive effect on operating
profits.
In terms of 1992-3 operating results, the specialty stores made a profit of
Dollars 418m, against Dollars 312m in the previous 52-week period. The
general merchandise operations recorded a profit of Dollars 156m, compared
with Dollars 131m.
Tiffany, the upmarket US jewellery retailer, continued to suffer from the
decline in luxury goods spending and a decline in sales to Japan during the
fourth quarter.
It posted final-quarter profits of Dollars 8.66m after tax, down from
Dollars 12.1m in the same period of 1991-2, taking the total for the year to
end-January to Dollars 15.7m, compared with Dollars 25.5m last time.
General Cinema, the investment company whose interests range from publishing
to a majority stake in the Neiman Marcus retail business, announced an
after-tax profit of Dollars 31.8m in the three months to end-January.
This compared with Dollars 407.2m profits figure last time which was scored
after a Dollars 39.2m accounting charge and a Dollars 419.6m extraordinary
gain. Operating profits increased from Dollars 43m to Dollars 45.6m.

global bond unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CS FIRST Boston, the New York-based investment banking group, has announced
changes to the management of its global bond business which include the
appointment of a new head of fixed-income sales and trading.
Mr Robert Diamond, formerly chairman and chief executive of CSFB's Pacific
subsidiary in Tokyo, will return to New York to run the bank's entire
fixed-income sales and trading operation, including its Far East business.
He is replacing Mr Thomas Sexton, who has resigned from his post for
'personal reasons'.
At the same time, Mr Robert Baylis, a vice-chairman of the firm, will move
to Hong Kong where he will take over Mr Diamond's old position as head of
the Pacific operating unit.
CSFB said the moves were designed to improve the co-ordination of its global
bond operations.
Mr John Hennessey, the firm's chief executive, said the moves meant CSFB now
'have two of our most senior managers tying together all of our fixed income
businesses on a worldwide basis.'
The changes at the top of CSFB come at a difficult time for First Boston,
the firm's big US subsidiary, which has been hit by some notable staff
defections.
Last week, for example, the head of fixed-income research left CSFB to join
a fund management group, and several other executives in investment banking
and capital markets also moved to other firms.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZIL, the Russian industrial conglomerate indelibly associated with the black
limousines which were the preserve of top communists in the former Soviet
Union, is to be privatised.
The government said yesterday that R1bn of nominal share capital - 1m shares
with a face value of R1,000 - will be offered for sale at 100 auction
centres across Russia.
Although Zil limousines are still used to whisk president Boris Yeltsin and
his bodyguards at high speeds through the Moscow traffic, demand has fallen
now that the new commercial elite prefer Mercedes and stretch Volvos. Zil
also produces heavy trucks of an outmoded design and refrigerators.
The cars are handmade at a rate of two or three a year, but the mode of
production guaranteed that each was unique so that parts were not
interchangeable. A company official declined to reveal the price.
The cars are still popular with well-heeled tourists. They are also bought
by smart young Russian bankers to conduct them from work to marble-floored
dachas. The armour plating and curtained seclusion of the passenger saloons,
which shielded the communist elite from terrorists and stares of the
curious, now serve the same function for the new commercial princes.
Western consulting companies which have looked at the enterprise have
concluded that any effort to transform the company into a successful and
profitable enterprise will be a mammoth task. It has between between 110,000
and 130,000 workers in 17 sites across Russia.
The biggest site is an ecological inferno located in a bend of the Moscow
river in the southern district of the capital. Requests to visit the plant
were yesterday brusquely refused on the grounds that the plant had
commercial secrets to protect.
The spread of Zil's sites, the wastefulness of its production methods and
the archaic nature of its designs lend a certain Stalinist splendour to the
company, but make it a nightmare for rationalisation and privatisation.
Perhaps in recognition of the difficulty of bringing Zil to the market, a
government official said foreign investment would be unlikely until 'a later
stage', when the various parts of the company had been broken up.
The shares offered represent 35 per cent of the share value of the company,
with 40 per cent going to the workforce and management either free or on
preferential terms and a further 25 per cent held in state hands for later
sale.
The enterprise is the first to be offered on an all-Russian basis, and
represents both an attempt to prove that organisations of this size can be
successfully sold off and a test of the nationwide system for offering
shares.

GENERAL MOTORS' efforts to cut its labour force received a boost yesterday
when the United Auto Workers' union announced that some 16,500 workers had
signed up for a special early retirement programme - far more than
originally expected.
The company, which is trying to reduce its workforce as part of a plan to
return its loss-making North American operations to profit, announced the
early retirement programme last December. The deadline for acceptance was
March 1.
The union originally estimated that some 7,000 workers might accept the
offer.

<TEXT>
ORKLA, the Norwegian group with interests ranging from paper to food and
drinks, saw 1992 pre-tax profits almost halve after a write-down on the
group's shareholdings and heavy securities losses. The profit plunged to
NKr315m (Dollars 45.19m) from NKr608m a year earlier.
Orkla was forced to write down by NKr656m its shareholdings in Elkem, the
troubled Norwegian light metals producer, and Uni Storebrand, Norway's
biggest insurer. Orkla has a 30 per cent stake in Elkem and had 4 per cent
of Uni's shares before the insurer collapsed last autumn.
It also suffered securities losses of NKr381m in 1992, against gains of
NKr262m in 1991.
However, operations performed strongly with sales increasing by 4 per cent
to NKr16.8bn last year from NKr16.1bn a year earlier.
Group operating profit increased by 37 per cent to NKr1.2bn in 1992 from
NKr870m in 1991.
The board proposed leaving the dividend payment unchanged at NKr3.75.
Orkla's A shares rose NKr3 to close at NKr190.50 on the Oslo bourse as its B
shares advanced NKr4 to NKr191.

tie-up
</HEADLINE>

   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the holiday tour operator, yesterday questioned the benefits that
rival Owners Abroad says it would achieve from a proposed tie-up with Thomas
Cook, the travel agency and financial services group.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said there was a great difference
between identifying costs savings from his proposed takeover of Owners
Abroad, and projecting increased sales.
Airtours also said that according to latest statistics from Stats MR, the
market research organisation, Owners Abroad's winter business was down at
the end of January. This meant that Owners Abroad would be making higher
winter losses from leased aircraft capacity that is surplus to needs.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, said estimates of benefits from the
tie-up with Thomas Cook and its sister LTU, the German holiday company, had
been approved by its auditors and advisers. These would be at least Pounds
9m in 1994 and at least Pounds 11m the following year.
He said Airtours still had not specified how it would arrive at savings from
a merged Airtours and Owners Abroad that Mr Crossland says would be
'significantly' above the benefits from the Thomas Cook tie-up.

NATIONWIDE, Britain's second-biggest building society, said yesterday that
there were grounds for cautious optimism that the housing market was on the
move in spite of reporting another fall in prices.
The society said that house prices on average had fallen 1.4 per cent in
February compared with the previous month. This had offset a rise of 1.2 per
cent in January.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive, said price changes tended to lag
sales activity. He added: 'In fact there have been increased levels of

FT  04 MAR 93 / Pension investment benefited trustees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two former pension fund trustees of the Universal Computers Group, now
in receivership, invested more than half the scheme's assets in a company
which paid them nearly Pounds 90,000 in fees and dividends and granted them
interest-free loans with no set repayment date.
UCG is the parent company of Ferrari Holdings, the Stock Exchange listed
computer services company which went into receivership in July 1990. The two
trustees, Mr Raymond Frederick Lewis and Mr Robert Woodland, were directors
of UCG. Neither of the two men was authorised to conduct investment business
in the UK.
The company which received the largest single investment is an investment
company, Giltpeak plc, in which the pension scheme invested Pounds 512,000
of its Pounds 562,000 capital. The company was incorporated on July 27 1990
and did not begin trading until nearly six months later.
Giltpeak, whose address is the same as the home address of Mr Woodland, also
paid Pounds 22,855 to Mr Woodland's wife for furniture, fixtures and
fittings, say the audited accounts for the year ended December 31 1991, the
only year for which accounts are available.
The accounts show that at year-end Mr Woodland and Mr Lewis had outstanding
loans of Pounds 14,404 and Pounds 15,936, which had peaked during the year
at Pounds 32,004 and Pounds 61,806 respectively. The accounts say the loans
pay no interest and have no set repayment date.
The accounts also show that the company had total turnover for the year of
Pounds 223,722 and profits of Pounds 41,363, of which Pounds 40,000 were
spent on dividends on common shares.
Although the pension scheme provided almost all the financing for Giltpeak,
it has no voting shares. Instead, it holds preference shares which pay
interest at 10 per cent per year and are redeemable in three tranches
beginning with a Pounds 170,000 payment at the end of this month.
According to the pension scheme's current trustees, GM Benefit Consultants,
appointed by the High Court in December 1992, the two men dismissed the
former trustee, actuarial consultants Noble Lowndes, a month before the
company went into receivership in July 1990. They then removed the scheme's
professional fund managers, London and Manchester (Managed Funds) Ltd, and
directed the scheme's investments into companies in which one or both men

FT  04 MAR 93 / Fiat bruised at crucial time: Arrests have added to the
group's problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, the flag bearer of Italian industry, has begun a delicate damage
limitation exercise to offset the impact on the group of the continued
imprisonment of Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, its chief financial officer.
Mr Mattioli has been held in a Milan jail since February 22 when he was
arrested with Mr Antonio Mosconi, chief executive of Toro, Fiat's insurance
arm, for alleged illicit funding of political parties. They are being
detained in connection with their previous roles on the board of
Cogefar-Impresit, the Turin-based group's construction company.
Last May Mr Enzo Papi, then Cogefar-Impresit's managing director, was
imprisoned for 55 days by Milan magistrates and only released after
confessing to the payment of a L1.8bn (Pounds 785,000) bribe for a Milan
metro contract. Mr Papi, who resigned from Cogefar-Impresit, has been
questioned again in recent days.
Fiat management on Tuesday declared the group's full solidarity for the two
imprisoned executives and called for their fate to be clarified as quickly
as possible. It said it was concerned that 'this judicial affair, because of
the resort to preventive detention and uncontrolled dissemination of
restricted information before any sentence, affects the reputation of these
people and the image of the company at a moment when it is directing all its
energies to provide jobs and be competitive'.
Whatever the outcome of the arrests, Fiat has been bruised at a crucial
time. Mr Guiseppe Turani, Italy's best known writer on corporate affairs,
commented after the arrests: 'Fiat has been hit by Milan magistrates at
perhaps the most delicate moment in its history, or at least during that
period which began almost 30 years ago when the 'Avvocato' (Giovanni
Agnelli) became president.'
The Fiat group, with its core business in the automotive sector, is
confronted by three vital challenges: to produce successful new models; to
forge new international alliances; and to produce an effective management
structure to cope with the departure next year of Mr Agnelli.
The challenges have already increased because of the downturn in Fiat's main
markets and Mr Agnelli's forecasts of a bleak 1993. On top of this, the
group can scarcely afford damage to its reputation or instability in Italy,
which accounts for 44 per cent of car sales, nor lose the services of Mr
Mattioli.
Mr Mattioli, aged 52, has been with Fiat since 1975 and has worked closely
with Mr Cesare Romiti, the group's chief executive. Last November he was
promoted in a management shake-up designed to prepare the way for the
departure of Mr Agnelli who has said he intends to step down in June next
year. He is to be succeeded by his brother Mr Umberto Agnelli.
The management structure was slimmed down and split in effect into two broad
sectors - industry and industrial development under Mr Giorgio Garuzzo and
financial control and resource management under Mr Mattioli.
Mr Garuzzo and Mr Mattioli reported to Mr Romiti who has also hinted he will
step down at about the same time as Mr Agnelli. In Turin Mr Garuzzo and Mr
Mattioli were both tipped as possible successors to Mr Romiti.
In any event Mr Mattioli has had the task of managing resources against
declining profits (forecast for 1992 at half the L1,609bn of 1991) and the
need to find resources to fund investment of L47,000bn during the rest of
the decade.
The prospect of Fiat raising cash by selling some of its non-core activities
such as Rinascente, the stores group, or even Toro insurance and the
Cogefar-Impresit, has helped push Fiat shares up steeply since the beginning
of the year.
Also fuelling the rise have been rumours of talks about a new alliance on
the car side. Last week Mr Agnelli specifically ruled out the Japanese but
was silent about the possibility of a European partner.
The Milan bourse rumour mill says the price is being talked up to make Fiat
shares more attractive for an alliance.
A tie-up with Renault is mentioned. Renault has denied this as it already
has its hands full with Volvo, and Fiat says an alliance now when it is
investing so heavily in new models makes no sense.
But the shares are still rising - despite the impact of the arrests. This
suggests foreign institutional buying of the shares in the belief Fiat will
benefit from devaluation and from its new models due when, as it is hoped,
the market picks up next year.
Fiat will need luck and good management.
The Italian business community is watching closely how long Mr Mattioli is
kept in jail and whether he can emerge unscathed.
As Mr Agnelli put it last week: 'Being caught up with the magistrature is
always worrying.
'It's a bit like being on the operating table - one hopes it will all go
well but there is always a risk.'

Allied Irish Banks' profits in the Republic of Ireland, reported in
Wednesday's FT, should have read IPounds 76.7m (Pounds 78.2m) and not
IPounds 72.7m. On an annualised basis this gives a 15.7 per cent downturn

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Terry's sale greeted with relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELIEF WAS the dominant emotion yesterday at Terry's Chocolate Works in
York, after staff heard that the company had been sold to Kraft General
Foods International for Pounds 220m.
'The general reaction is, thank God it's all over,' said Mr Vic Botterill,
chief shop steward at the factory for the General Municipal Boilermakers
Union, which represents the plant's 800 blue collar employees and up to 200
casual workers.
Mr Botterill said the sale to KGFI, part of Philip Morris, the large US
tobacco and foods group, could allow the Chocolate Works, source of
chocolate oranges and the All Gold and Moonlight ranges to gain some more
lines.
He said the employees were glad that Terry's had not been sold to Cadbury
Schweppes or Nestle, because of their competing product ranges. There had
been fears, he said, that such a deal could have resulted in product ranges
being moved from Terry's York plant.
'We have the facilities here, we have the potential: it's a big world out
there,' said Mr Botterill.
There was some sadness, he added, that United Biscuits had sold. 'Everybody
slags off employers but they've put in a lot of investment.'
Terry's was founded in 1767 by two citrus peel importers, who opened a shop
making and selling sweets in Bootham, York. In 1823 they were joined by an
apothecary, Mr Joseph Terry. Subsequent expansion led the company to its
present imposing five-storey building, often glimpsed on television
broadcasts of horse racing from York.
Despite its strong tourist image, York has traditionally had an important
manufacturing base, founded on the twin pillars of the railways and
confectionery.
Terry's, with just over 1,000 employees, is the second biggest confectioner.
Nestle employs 4,500 in the city and Cravens about 600.

FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sabena relaunches with modest
profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SABENA, the Belgian national airline, yesterday relaunched its corporate and
financial image with a surprise announcement that it had returned to modest
profit after years of heavy losses.
The company attributed its recovery to the 11-month-old partnership with Air
France, the French national carrier.
Mr Pierre Godfroid, chairman, said the group expected a consolidated net
profit of BFr6m (Dollars 180,000) for 1992, against a loss of BFr2.44bn in
1991 and a loss of BFr5.17bn in 1990.
Group results cover the performance of the scheduled airline, centralised
operations and regional and charter services. Mr Godfroid said more details
would be released in April.
Mr Godfroid said Sabena could not have achieved such results without Air
France's support, particularly on fleet management, which he said saved the
Belgian company about BFr500m last year.
The modest recovery has not come cheaply. Air France and a Belgian
consortium agreed last April to inject BFr6bn into Sabena in the years up to
1994, and take a 37.6 per cent stake. The Belgian government contributed a
further BFr9bn on top of earlier heavy investment. Further state aid would
almost certainly be banned by the European Commission.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of asylum seekers arriving in Germany reached more than 38,000 in
February, a mid-winter record, with a sharp increase in the number coming
from Romania.
In spite of strenuous efforts by German border police to stem the flow of
would-be immigrants from eastern Europe, the latest statistics show an
increase of 20 per cent in the first two months of the year, compared with
the same period in 1992.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the German interior minister, said the latest figures
provided confirmation of the need for urgent changes in the country's
liberal asylum law, currently delayed in parliamentary procedures.
He also released figures showing that of 34,505 applications for asylum
processed in the course of February, only 539, or 1.6 per cent, were
granted. Of the remainder, 68 per cent were rejected as economic migrants,
not political refugees, and 30 per cent withdrawn.
In the February figures for asylum-seekers, no fewer than 45 per cent came
from Romania and Bulgaria - 12,853 from Romania, compared with only 3,760 a
year ago. In contrast, there was a 45 per cent fall in the number from
former Yugoslavia: 5,637 this year, compared with 12,540 last February.

<TEXT>
SERBS yesterday lifted a week-long blockade of the River Danube which
stranded at least 22 ships in ports along the river and halted international
traffic.
The Romanian ministry of transport said 22 convoys, including ships from
Austria, Bulgaria, Holland, Hungary, Romania and Ukraine had been stranded
on either side of the barricades formed of barges near the Serb frontier
port of Prahovo. A further 24 vessels were waiting in Romanian Danube ports.
Serb harbour workers had strung 12 barges across a Serbian and Romanian
stretch of the river last Tuesday in retaliation for Romania's enforcement
of UN sanctions. The harbour workers had said they would not lift the
barricade until Romania allowed a Serbian ship loaded with 4,000 tonnes of
fuel oil to sail upstream to Belgrade.
Trade between the Black Sea countries and Europe has been severely disrupted
by the blockade. About 35 ships and 120 barges passed through the Iron Gates
lock, upstream from Prahovo, each week.

SWEDEN'S central bank governor yesterday ruled out pegging the krona to the
European currency unit in favour of linking it to the D-Mark or entering the
European exchange rate mechanism once Sweden became a member of the European
Community, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Sweden, along with Norway and Finland, has applied to join the EC and hopes
to become a member by 1995.
Sweden uncoupled the krona from the Ecu on November 19 and the currency has
since been devalued by about 20 per cent. The krona was floated after a
failed attempt to maintain the Ecu link, including an increase by the
central bank in the key overnight lending rate to 500 per cent.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY remains determined to push for early EC membership and to trade on
its growing importance as a regional power to do so.
Mr Erdal Inonu, Turkey's prime minister, made clear yesterday Ankara was
looking beyond its recently-enhanced political relationship with the EC to
firm commitments that it will get membership.
'We are sticking to the aim of becoming members in the near future,' he said
in an interview with the FT. 'We are not looking for definite dates but for
support, so that Turkey is not left in limbo.'
Mr Inonu is the leader of the Social Democratic Populist party, junior
partner in Mr Suleyman Demirel's conservative-led coalition.
He stressed the benefit to Europe of Turkey's strategic role as a
stabilising force on the Turkic nations of central Asia, and a bulwark
against Iranian influence in these former Soviet republics.
'To get that assurance' of EC membership 'would guarantee the benefit of the
role Turkey can play in that part of the world,' Mr Inonu said.
'If not, the EC won't get the benefit of that role.'
Mr Inonu was in Brussels for talks with the European Commission, including
with its president, Mr Jacques Delors, as part of a European tour taking in
five EC member states.
Top-level ministerial contact with the EC was institutionalised last
November as part of an upgrading of the 29-year-old association agreement
Turkey has with the European Community.
Turkey's 1987 membership application was turned down in 1989 because of
doubts about its democratic credentials and human rights record, and because
its economy and per capita income lagged far behind average EC development
levels.
Mr Inonu said his government's 'aims of democratisation and stable growth
had been taken up convincingly'.
They had prompted changes in the attitude of the EC, he declared.

THE cost to France of deploying some 10,000 soldiers in the service of the
United Nations and of other emergency military missions abroad will rise
from FFr3.2bn (Pounds 400m) last year to FFr4bn this year, Mr Pierre Joxe,
the defence minister, forecast yesterday.
Clearly regarding as a dubious privilege France's provision of more troops
to the UN than any other country, Mr Joxe told the newspaper Les Echos that
he had asked the government to bear the cost of bonuses for soldiers serving
overseas out of its general budget. Otherwise, the defence equipment budget
would suffer, he warned.
Pay bonuses account for two-thirds of special military operations abroad,
the minister said. Conscripts, for instance, who volunteer to serve in
Yugoslavia receive FFr5,000 a month, or 10 times their normal stipend at
home.
The Socialists strongly oppose the phasing out of conscription, proposed by
some leading members of the RPR Gaullists who are expected to form part of
the new government after next month's election. The army general staff
yesterday published a study claiming that the French army of 250,000 men was
not only 'no worse equipped' than Britain's purely professional force of
130,000, but 20 per cent cheaper.
Meanwhile, Mr Joxe has said more arms sales like last month's deal to supply
the United Arab Emirates with Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.46bn) worth of tanks
could be in the offing.
He cited Oman as a potential buyer.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS and European Community negotiators yesterday deplored the
continuation of heavy fighting in eastern Bosnia while peace talks under
their auspices were taking place in New York.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen deplored the fact that despite numerous
assurances, as well as Security Council calls for the observance of
international humanitarian law, land relief convoys were still blocked.
The joint mediators urged immediate access and measures to enable the
wounded to be evacuated. They also expressed concern about new displacements
of innocent civilians.
Their statement was issued after President Alija Izetbegovic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina raised the matter with the mediators at the outset of his
first meeting with them since the talks were transferred from Geneva.
On Monday he told reporters in Washington that he was bringing proposals to
the UN for a US role in a ceasefire and military disengagement, but no
details of this were immediately avail-able.
Responding to the Bosnian leader's insistence that he would not take part in
full-scale negotiations, Mr Fred Eckhard, the conference spokesman,
observed: 'I think his presence here this morning is the answer.'
However, there was still no indication if or when a negotiating session
including all the parties would take place in New York.

came shortly after the region was sealed off in response to the murder of
two Israelis in Tel Aviv. Picture, Page 4

FT  03 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Abbey dull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was slight disappointment in the market with full-year figures from
Abbey National, but dealers said most of the sharp fall in the shares was a
reflection of their recent strong outperformance against the wider market.
One specialist pointed to the improved profits performance in the second
half of the year, which he said went largely unexplained. 'The interest
margin was 2.1 per cent in the first half and 2.5 per cent in the second
half; there are question marks about the company's ability to maintain
margins,' he added.
Abbey dropped to 378p at one stage following the results, but later rallied
to close 12 off on balance at 385p.
Fisons' preliminary figures were viewed as marginally disappointing and saw
the shares retreat to finish a net 7 down at 222p, after 219p, on good
turnover of 5.5m.
General Accident's preliminary results, accompanied by a Pounds 110m issue
of preference shares, were much as expected and failed to trigger any
substantial excitement in the market.
The shares drifted back 10 to 585p, with analysts adopting the view that the
stock's near 30 per cent premium to net asset value was too large in the
composite sector.
'There is a useful yield but no prospect of a dividend increase for 1993,'
said one analyst, who also pointed out that a rights issue might still be
made in around a year's time.
Guardian Royal, reporting today, eased 5 to 188p. Sun Alliance came under
more selling pressure, closing 7 weaker at 326p in relatively heavy volume
of 6.1m shares; the group announces its preliminary numbers on April 8.
Barclays came in for a flurry of support, ending 7 firmer at 432p ahead of
tomorrow's full-year results, which are keenly awaited by the market. A
reduction in the dividend, widely forecast by some of the market's leading
analysts, would not only trigger a steep fall in Barclays' shares, dealers
said, but severely damage confidence in the wider market.
A strong performance by BICC was mostly responsible for the good showing by
the FT-Actuaries electricals index, which moved up 2.9 per cent compared
with a marginal rise in the FT-SE Mid-250 Index and weakness in the FT-SE
100.
BICC finished 12 higher at 345p, helped by increasing optimism over the
preliminary figures due this morning. Turnover reached a healthy 4.6m,
boosted by an agency cross of 500,000 shares at 343 1/2 p. SG Warburg,
recommending clients to increase holdings, believes the dividend will be
maintained.
The general consensus is that the cables and construction group should
report profits similar to last year's Pounds 81m, although estimates range
from Pounds 70m to around Pounds 85m. The profits total would be net of
exceptional charges of Pounds 40m, comprising Pounds 30m for the write-down
of the development at Spitalfields, London, and Pounds 10m for the Channel
tunnel project.
Delta, second-largest component of the electricals group, rose 6 to 438p.
A cautious statement accompanying the interim results from Raine Industries
did little to comfort the market and unsettled the stock, which dropped to
99p before finishing a net 12 off at 101p.
US buying, coupled with hopes of a recovery in European steel prices, helped
shares in ASW Holdings, the Cardiff-based steel and wire group, shrug off
Monday's poor figures. The stock forged ahead 24 to 177p.
The strong sentiment in ASW helped boost trade in several other stocks.
Chief among these was British Steel, which had a busy session as turnover
rose to 20m. The shares hardened 3 1/2 to 86p.
Another beneficiary was Glynwed International, which appreciated 4 to 273p,
while William Cook advanced 14 to 155p.
Engineering group James Wilkes, in which Suter now holds an 8.9 per cent
stake, suffered from profit-taking after Monday's strong run. Having climbed
4 to 70p in early trading, the shares closed 10 lighter on the day at 56p.
Suter once again ended unchanged at 135p.
Both James Capel and Hoare Govett were reported to have recommended Siebe
and the stock appreciated 9 to 484p.
Among transport stocks, P &amp; O moved forward 6 to 568p as NatWest Securities
urged investors to buy the stock. NatWest said it 'provides a good example
of a stock which combines security of dividend with improving fundamentals'.
With results expected towards the end of the month, the securities house
once again said it believed the dividend to be secure.
Hoare Govett was said to have been the big seller of Hays, which reported
unchanged interim figures yesterday. The shares gave up 14 to 227p. SG
Warburg was positive on NFC, which closed 3 better at 267p.
Shares in Rank Organisation were boosted by recommendations from several
brokers. The stock climbed 9 to 676p, with SG Warburg, the company's own
broker, among those to recommend the stock. Kleinwort Benson believes the
shares to be a buy in the long term.
Nervous trading in Ladbroke Group ahead of tomorrow's figures left the
shares 2 lighter at 193p. The range of forecasts is between Pounds 185m and
Pounds 190m, before property write-downs.
Shares in Carlton Communications again suffered from the threat of a
competitor in the video copying market and they fell 9 to 769p.
Among hotels, Queens Moat Houses was wanted and the shares put on 2 at 52p.
The market continued to suspect trading difficulties at Tate &amp; Lyle, where
the chief executive resigned on Monday. The shares retreated another 5 to
429p.

FT  03 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Catalyst hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Precious metal refiner Johnson Matthey tumbled late in the session on
reports that Allied-Signal, the US chemical company, had developed a
palladium-based automobile exhaust catalyst that replaces the use of
platinum.
The story has been around before but nevertheless sent shares in the world's
leading platinum refiner into retreat, falling 19 to 459p at the day's
worst.
Analysts, however, remained sceptical and one said: 'This story has been
around before and the falls then were short-lived and this could be the
same.'
The company also said there was nothing new in the story, and with the
market coming to the view that there was unlikely to be a serious effect on
profits derived from platinum, the shares rallied just ahead of the market
close to finish 16 down at 462p after thin volume.

FT  03 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Demand from US lifts BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YET ANOTHER burst of strong and sustained US buying interest drove BP shares
up to their highest level since doubts over its ability to maintain the
dividend first appeared over a year ago. Such has been the American appetite
for BP shares in recent months that London-based oil specialists believe
that US investors now hold more than 25 per cent of the equity.
BP closed 7 1/2 higher at 282 1/2 p, the best closing level since February
12, with exceptionally heavy turnover of 14m shares attributed in the main
to buyers from the US.
Demand for the shares was apparent from the outset, with marketmakers
hoisting opening levels to accommodate the big rise in BP stock on Wall
Street overnight. News of the sale to Western Mining of the 49 per cent
minority stake in the Olympic Dam uranium/copper/nickel mine for some
Dollars 240m plus repayment of Dollars 190m of loans had been expected;
Western Mining exercised pre-emption rights over Olympic Dam after Minorco
made a similar offer.
A London-based analyst said US investors 'are not buying BP in isolation',
pointing to the recent strong gains in companies such as Exxon, Mobil,
Texaco and Chevron. 'US funds have focused on the oils' yield relative
against the Treasury long-bond and the Standard &amp; Poor's indices.'

FT  03 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets lacked enthusiasm yesterday, and the March futures
contract on the FT-SE 100 Index made no attempt to provide a lead for the
underlying stock market. However, it maintained its good premium over cash
and reflected underlying confidence which was not seriously dented by
indications from the Bundesbank that cuts in German interest rates are
unlikely to be announced at tomorrow's policy meeting.
For most of the day, the premium over the Footsie held at around 5 points,
contrasting with the 4-point discount to the fair value premium calculated
by most market traders. However, after the official close, the March
contract touched the 2,900 mark, close to the all-time high on the
underlying stock market and the focus of investment attention at present.
Turnover was disappointing, with the day's total of 6,077 contracts barely
half of some recent daily figures. The heavyweight securities houses were
largely absent from the market and locals had little incentive to take
positions.
Increased activity in traded options, where contracts totalled 32,344,
against 18,536 the previous day, left aside the FT-SE 100 contract, where
only 4,986 lots were traded, against 5,622 on Monday.
The Euro FT-SE traded a total of 9,001, while BP led the league table among
the stock options, with 3,696 lots as US funds secured stock.

FT  03 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Quiet session as rate hopes dwindle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate hopes dimmed a little on the UK stock market yesterday after
the Bundesbank disappointed the optimists with the announcement of its
latest repo tender rate. With the governor of the Bank of England also
warning that domestic rates would be raised if the pound, or the inflation
rate, required defending, equities drifted into a pre-Budget torpor.
Share prices, lacking a lead from stock index futures, moved within narrow
bands. Having edged slightly firmer at first, the market turned down to show
an 11-point loss on the Footsie at mid-morning after the Bundesbank had set
its disappointing repo rate. The move was seen as virtually eliminating the
chances of any serious reduction in German rates when the Bundesbank meets
tomorrow.
For the rest of the London session, the market rallied very slowly,
receiving a final boost towards the close from a modest improvement in
sterling, and from a steady opening by New York equities in spite of reports
of some slight disappointment with the latest US leading economic
indicators.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed just 0.3 down at 2,882.3. Traders noted the
evident unwillingness of the market to test the Footsie's trading high of
2,900.1, reached at the beginning of last month. With the Budget now less
than two weeks away, there was a cautious response in the marketplace to a
forecast by a leading institutional broker of a Footsie at 3,000 by Budget
Day.
Strategists expect a modest tightening of fiscal policy in the Budget
speech, probably counter-balanced by a cut in base rates. But for the rest
of this week the market is likely to be dominated by the flow of results
from important UK companies. Abbey National, General Accident and Fisons all
shaded easier after announcing trading results yesterday but gave the stock
market no evident cause for anguish.
Seaq trading volume increased to 573.2m shares from the 535.2m of the
previous session, lifted by activity in a clutch of blue chip stocks in the
financial and oil sectors. Non-Footsie stocks made up 62 per cent of
yesterday's Seaq total, maintaining recent averages. The healthy level of
retail business continued on Monday, when it was worth Pounds 1.15bn.
Leading market indices were held back by weakness in a handful of major
names. ICI remained under a cloud as both UK and US investors continued to
assess the valuation prospects of the two new companies which will emerge
when the existing group is demerged later this year. Glaxo was also out of
favour, adding to the gloom which has clouded over the pharmaceuticals
sector and thus over ICI's plan to demerge its pharmaceutical interests.
BAT Industries gave ground sharply, with the early fall compounded by
weakness in the US dollar later in the London trading session. London
traders were puzzled by BAT's weakness, which appeared to be a delayed
reaction to transatlantic pressures.
The postponement, yet again, of interest rate hopes, brought some
profit-taking in the construction and contracting sectors as some traders
decided to withdraw from this area until the opening on Monday of the new
equity account, which takes in Budget Day. Store and retail issues, also
responsive to interest rate views, traded quietly.

FT  03 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic indicators push Dow
up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER A hesitant opening, US markets posted sharp gains yesterday, aided by
stronger than expected leading economic indicators, heavy demand for RJR
Nabisco shares, and a surge of late program buying, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 45.12 at 3,400.53, its
high for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 5.89 to 447.90, while
the American SE composite finished 2.53 ahead at 410.07 and the Nasdaq
composite 8.21 stronger at 677.72.
Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 270m shares and rises
outnumbered declines by 1,268 to 635.
Prices slipped initially, primarily in reaction to weak bond prices. But the
bond market was responding to generally positive news for equities - an
unexpected 0.1 per cent rise in January's index of leading economic
indicators, which analysts said bode well for both the employment outlook
and corporate earnings.
Analysts also noted some technical features which revealed the underlying
strength in equities, notably that in the past eight trading sessions the
number of advancing stocks has totalled more than 1,000 every day.
Prices were also helped later in the day by news of strong late-January
stores sales, by a surge in computer-guided program buying during the final
hour of business, and by heavy trading in the shares of RJR Nabisco.
The food and tobacco group announced plans to create a separate group of
shares targeted to performance of its worldwide food businesses through a
Dollars 1.5bn initial public offering of stock. The plan was warmly greeted
by investors, who bid up RJR stock Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 8 7/8 as nearly
13m shares changed hands in busy trading.
Kmart rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 24 3/8 in volume of 1.9m shares after the
retailing group announced record fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 535m, up
from Dollars 479m a year ago. Elsewhere in the sector, Wal-Mart firmed
Dollars 1 to Dollars 34 and JC Penney rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 81 3/8 .
Knight-Ridder fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 57 5/8 after securities house
Kidder Peabody lowered its rating on the stock from a 'buy' to a 'hold',
citing concern about the information group's revenues and costs.
On the Nasdaq market, medical related stocks, recently battered by worries
about the implications for corporate earnings of planned healthcare reform,
bounced back. Biogen rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 31, Chiron added Dollars 3
1/4 at Dollars 52, SciMed Life put on Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 48 and Heart
Technology firmed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 18.
Canada
THE TORONTO market ended a three-day losing streak, closing higher after
further heavy trading. The TSE 300 index improved 13.5 to 3,446.2, although
rises led falls by only 315 to 311.
Volume rose to 52.8m shares from Monday's 42.7m. Yesterday's volume included
a block trade of about 2.1m Curragh shares, representing 12.9 per cent of
the company's outstanding shares. The price of the block was off 80 cents
from Monday's closing price. Curragh said in a press release that it knew of
no reason for the decline in the stock, which lost 45 cents at 85 cents.

FT  03 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rate cut optimism ebbs after
German repo move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGHER than expected repo rate in Germany slightly dampened hopes of a cut
in key interest rates this Thursday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT consolidated, banks staying relatively strong on the view that
rate cuts are only a matter of time, and degree. Deutsche Bank ended
unchanged at DM711, while Dresdner rose DM2.50 to DM407.30 as the DAX index
eased 4.21 to 1,696.74, and turnover fell from DM7.5bn to DM6.8bn.
Notable fallers included Hoechst, down DM5.10 at DM260.90 following adverse
media comment on the likely health impact of last week's toxic chemicals
spillage in the suburbs of Frankfurt.
Carmakers were mixed, with BMW down DM5.40 to DM497.50, but Volkswagen
DM4.50 higher at DM278.50. VW said in Geneva that recent reports on its
prospects had been too gloomy, that it would break even this year and that
it would focus on profits, not volume, in the 1990s.
PARIS finally broke through the 2,000 barrier to close at its highest level
for about 9 months. The CAC-40 index, which had seen a day's low of 1,987,
finished just 2.50 ahead at 2,0001.50 in turnover of some FFr2.9bn. Some
analysts said that while the 2,000 level had been in target since last week
it was not clear who was buying the market, although some US funds had been
seen.
Michelin was among the day's losers after an independent research group cut
its earnings forecasts in half because of the depressed state of the car
sector. The shares fell FFr4.60 or 2.5 per cent to FFr181.60.
MILAN was driven by Monday's late news that the Italian cabinet had approved
a decree law allowing the establishment of private pension funds. Even a
downgrade by Standard and Poor's, the US rating agency, of the country's
long term debt had little lasting effect on sentiment and the Comit index
closed up 5.49 at 536.68 in heavy turnover.
Against this, analysts said that economic fundamentals remain poor, that the
pension fund news has already been discounted and that, while fresh
liquidity will be generated, this is unlikely to have any effect on the
equity market before the end of the year.
Generali, the county's largest insurer, which had advanced nearly 6 per cent
on Monday ahead of the cabinet's announcement, eased on the kerb, losing L60
to L36,950.
AMSTERDAM weakened with KLM being affected by a statement from SAS which
cautioned against hopes that talks between the Dutch carrier and members of
the European Quality Alliance - SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines - would
eventually lead to a merger between the four. The CBS Tendency lost 0.6 to
99.3 with KLM down Fl 1.10 at Fl 24.70.
MADRID eased on profit-taking, the general index closing 1.05 lower at
235.61. Banks were flat on average and constructions generally weaker.
The day's big fall was reserved for the recently ebullient Nissan Iberica,
Pta34, or nearly 10 per cent lower at Pta313, reporting a big 1992 loss in
the middle of an ambitious expansion programme.
STOCKHOLM retreated on profit-taking, the Affarsvarlden general index
slipping 3.8 to 1,014.3 in turnover down to SKr729m from SKr873m.
Skandia, the insurance group, lost SKr6 to SKr112 after Allianz of Germany
denied that it was interested in a takeover.
ZURICH's SMI index rose 10.3 to 2,130.8, banks and insurers rising as
investors moved frombonds into equities.
Industrials received less attention. Kleinwort Benson was quoted yesterday
as advising asset allocators to underweight the Swiss equity market, with
particular reference to uncertainty in the pharmaceuticals sector.
DUBLIN's ISEQ overall index closed 30.05 higher at 1,367.47 for a two-day
gain of 4.4 per cent. Mr Robbie Kelleher, head of research at Davy
Stockbrokers, said that there were three main reasons: a growing belief that
interest rates were going to come down significantly; news of a US bid for
the government stake in the food group, Greencore; and results from Allied
Irish Banks.
The AIB results were better than expected, said Mr Kelleher, leaving the
shares 9p higher at IPounds 2.09, and giving added strength to a financial
sector already lifted by interest rate prospects.

in a weak region

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDEX-LINKED selling by investment trusts depressed share prices, and the
Nikkei average closed lower in spite of a late bout of arbitrage buying,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index ended 15.35 down at 16,864.25 after a day's high of
16,922.75 and low of 16,796.53. The index fell in the morning on lingering
concern over weaker than expected corporate profits, but recouped some of
its loss in afternoon trading.
Volume picked up to 220m shares from 194m and declines finally led advances
by 584 to 377, with 167 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks eased by a marginal 0.43 to 1,275.82, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.38 to 1,026.00.
In spite of the fall in the leading index, traders said sentiment was firm.
Public funds were seen placing buying orders around the 16,500 level, and
continued strength in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, usually seen as a
market benchmark, provided some optimism.
NTT gained Y15,000 at Y646,000 in heavy trading, with 38,618 shares changing
hands, the heaviest since March 1991. The issue has advanced due to
anticipation of a rise in city call rates, which is expected to improve
earnings.
Reports last week that the government will focus its new economic stimulus
package on upgrading the country's telecommunication infrastructure also
prompted dealer buying.
Telecommunications engineering companies with close ties to NTT
strengthened. Daimei Telecom Engineering, which installs telecom wires for
NTT, climbed Y23 to Y685, while Nippon Comsys moved ahead Y26 to Y727 and
Kyowa Exeo Y34 to Y859. Cable companies were firm, with Fujikura rising Y11
to Y569 and Hitachi Cable Y2 to Y644.
Tokyo Steel, the electric furnace steel maker which declined on Monday
following a downward earnings revision by Nomura Research Institute,
rebounded Y80 to Y2,210 on bargain hunting.
Toyobo, a leading textile manufacturer, shed Y9 to Y318 on reports that it
would close its cotton-spinning plants temporarily due to sluggish demand.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 59.66 to 17,896.82 in volume of 63.7m shares.
Liquidation of margin positions pushed the index below the 18,000 level for
the first time since January 27.
In Singapore, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange said trading of
the Nikkei 225 futures last month surged 2.45 times from the previous year
to 283,118 contracts due to firm interest from Japanese fund managers.
Roundup
WITH THE exception of Australia the region weakened yesterday.
AUSTRALIA continued to climb, adding to Monday's substantial gains. The All
Ordinaries index put on 5.8 at 1,645.0 in turnover of ADollars 377.6m.
Good earnings results and the prospects of an interest rate cut contributed
to the strength of the market. Among the banks, ANZ advanced 6 cents to
ADollars 3.50 with 8.1m shares changing hands, Westpac firmed 3 cents to
ADollars 3.22 and Commonwealth appreciated 12 cents to ADollars 7.02.
HONG KONG began to decline at the opening on reports in the Chinese press
that Li Peng, the Chinese premier, will make a strong attack on Hong Kong
governor Mr Chris Patten in his report to the country's parliament this
month.
The Hang Seng index lost 54.59 at 6,344.23, after reaching a low for the day
of 6,340.50 in the afternoon, in turnover of HKDollars 3.5bn.
Mr Patten said diplomatic exchanges were still taking place and that he
would make an important statement this week 'which will set out the way
ahead'.
Some property stocks, which made sharp gains on Monday, fell back: Cheung
Kong receded 30 cents to HKDollars 22.20. HSBC fell 50 cents to HKDollars
64.50.
TAIWAN declined on profit-taking and the weighted index closed 172.60, or
3.8 per cent, lower at 4,344.99. Turnover was a heavy TDollars 93bn, its
highest since May 1991. Financials, which have led the recent equity rally,
were particularly hard hit.
However, some brokers said that in spite of yesterday's weakness, the
medium-term outlook remained optimistic because of an improving economic and
political situation.
SINGAPORE extended its falls as investors continued to take profits. The
Straits Times Industrial index slipped 6.09 to 1,652.81 in volume down to
123m shares from 166m.
SEOUL lost ground for the fifth straight trading day but volume was said to
be thin. The composite index dipped 9.23 to 633.73 in turnover of
Won234.3bn.
MANILA retreated further, with the composite index giving up 20.44 to
1,473.95 in turnover down to 163m pesos from 196m pesos. PLDT surrendered 15
pesos to 965 pesos.

FT  03 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok pulls back from 1,000 barrier -
One bad news item after another has forced the SET index down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only a month ago the Stock Exchange of Thailand index, comfortably supported
by strong corporate earnings growth, seemed poised to celebrate the market's
bull run by breaking through the 1,000-point barrier.
In the past few weeks, however, one bad news item after another has
conspired to force the index down. From a peak of 998.44 in January, the SET
index fell to 910.52 on Monday this week before staging a moderate recovery
yesterday to 922.48. 'It is funny how quickly a market can lose 10 per
cent,' said one stockbroker in Bangkok yesterday.
The first blow to confidence was the closure of First City Investment, a
listed finance and securities company which ran out of money and suspended
payment of mature promissory notes.
Although the company was regarded as badly managed, and although the Bank of
Thailand, the central bank, has arranged a rescue, some local investors
remembered the market fall which followed the collapse of Raja Finance 13
years ago and feared that there would again be knock-on effects from the
closure.
The mood was not helped by mutterings about a possible dispute within the
Democrat Party, which leads the coalition government, over whether to save
FCI or not; Ms Patcharee Wongpaitoon, the wealthy businesswoman at the helm
of the company, is the daughter of a former Democrat leader. Nor was
sentiment improved by the comments of a frustrated opposition MP who called
for a military coup d'etat during a dispute over the 1993 budget.
Meanwhile, the authorities have been continuing their painfully slow
attempts to prosecute Mr Song Watcharasriroj, a leading player in the market
better known as Sia Song, for illegal share price manipulation.
The gloomy assumption among the local speculators who account for most of
the SET's turnover is that the regulators have so much egg on their faces
over the mishandling of the Sia Song and FCI affairs - it turns out that the
central bank knew of FCI's bad debt problems by the middle of last year -
that they will redouble their efforts to tighten controls on the market.
Questions were already being raised about the quality of FCI's accounts when
Siam Cement, the largest cement producer in Thailand, disclosed that its
audited 1992 net profit of Bt3.56bn (Dollars 140m) was Bt400m below the
unaudited figures announced earlier, as well as being below the 1991 profit
of Bt3.89bn. The share price fell sharply.
Another unsettling factor for the SET has been the suggestion that the
widespread premiums for the limited number of shares that can be legally
held by foreigners will disappear if the authorities approve a plan to set
up a trust fund to keep shares for foreign investors.
As if all this were not enough, news dribbled out that the board of Bangkok
Bank, the largest bank which accounts for about 5 per cent of the entire
market capital-isation, had approved an eventual doubling of its registered
capital to Bt20bn and was planning a three-for-10 rights issue this year.
The disappointment among investors was palpable. They had believed that
commercial banks were generating enough money from their record profits to
avoid such calls for fresh capital and dilution of earnings; and since
Bangkok Bank was the market leader, the others were bound to follow.
Banks shares account for about a quarter of the SET index, and their
behaviour has been partly responsible for the rise - and the recent fall -
of the index. Several bank share prices have tripled in the past 18 months,
prompting some brokers to suggest that the market's recent decline is no
more than a timely correction.
Many brokers predict in any case that by the end of the year the index will
reach 1,100 or 1,200 because earnings growth remains so strong across the
economy.
Yesterday was perhaps a typical day. With the tourist trade dented by the
political violence last May, the Oriental Hotel reported a fall in profits
in 1992. But Land and Houses, a property company, announced net profits 75
per cent up at Bt1.24bn; Charoen Pokphand Feedmill was up 30 per cent to
Bt1.19bn; and Nation Publishing was 52 per cent higher at Bt184.5m. Most
companies in Europe and Japan can still only dream of results like that.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Repo rate surprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE surprise of many market participants, the prospects for an immediate
easing in German monetary policy dimmed yesterday after the Bundesbank
announced that it would be offering some wholesale funds to commercial banks
at unchanged rates this week, writes James Blitz.
The German central bank stated that it would be offering a fixed rate repo
for 14-day bills in its weekly securities repurchase tender at 8.49 per
cent.
A variable rate repo will be offered for 28-day bills, and
some dealers felt that the rates for these funds might come down by as much
as 15 basis points. Nevertheless, futures dealers scaled back expect-ations
of an easing in German monetary policy this week.
Some dealers suggested that the Bundesbank council might still cut the
discount rate following its deliberations on Thursday. They claimed that the
Bundesbank was keeping its powder dry by not tampering with the repo early
in the week.
A more likely reason for the central bank's caution may have been another
sharp fall in the German call money rate yesterday, to 8.61 per cent.
This week's reduction in the minimum reserve require-ments for commercial
banks by DM32bn has brought the cost of overnight lending down. The
Bundesbank may be waiting to see how liquidity behaves in the next few days
before moving the repo.
The March Euromark con-tract consequently fell back 7 basis points to close
at 91.95, at which level it is targeting three-month money in less than two
weeks' time at 8.05 per cent.
The March short sterling contract was down 6 basis points on the day to
94.00, although this was partly due to the Governor of the Bank of England's
comment on Monday night that Britain would raise interest rates if it felt a
falling pound imperilled its goal of low inflation.
Three-month sterling cash closed  1/16 percentage point higher at 6 1/16 per
cent, because of difficulties removing a Pounds 650m shortage in the
discount market.
Thursday is increasingly looking like a critical day. If the Bundesbank
leaves policy unchanged, the reserve requirement changes might still allow
three-month money to converge with the current price of the March Euromark
contract. Even so, some dealers would not exclude a backlash.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar softens on rate news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE dollar weakened slightly against the D-Mark yesterday after the
Bundesbank revealed that it would not be cutting the rate at which it offers
wholesale funds to German commercial banks, writes James Blitz.
Currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism were mostly unaffected by
the Bundesbank's decision to leave the 14-day repo in its weekly securities
repurchase tender unchanged at 8.49 per cent.
However, the German central bank's decision showed a far more cautious
stance on monetary policy than foreign exchange dealers had expected, and
the run-up to tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting will be unsettled.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, believes that if the
discount rate is not reduced, the French franc will break through the
FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark in the ERM, closer to its floor of
FFr3.4330.
For some days now, the dollar has been trading in a broad range of DM1.62 to
DM1.6650, restrained by indicators that show the US economy is recovering at
only a sluggish pace.
Yesterday's move by the Bundesbank underlined that the differential between
US and German short-term rates may remain in the D-Mark's favour for some
time to come. There was also a disappointing economic indicator, with US new
home sales dropping 13.8 per cent in January after a downward revised 4.7
per cent increase in December.
The dollar finished in London at DM1.6425 from a previous DM1.6465. In New
York it slipped further to close at DM1.6390.
In Europe, the French franc remained fairly steady against the D-Mark,
ending at FFr3.389 from a previous FFr3.394. Sterling gained a pfennig,
closing at DM2.3800.
Some dealers had expected the British currency to perform more strongly in
the wake of comments from the Bank of England governor that UK base rates
would rise if the currency depreciated further. Mr Jim O'Neill of Swiss
Banking Corporation believes that if sterling breaks above DM2.40 in the
next few days, it will have been through the worst.
On German rates, Mr O'Neill said: 'It is a brave person who has a confident
view about the Bundesbank in the run-up to a council meeting. There is a
clear group in the council who are in favour of easing and will be in favour
of easing again.'
But he also believes that, whatever the Bundesbank does, it will be hard for
the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo and the Irish punt to stay in the
ERM. 'Their relatively poor fundamentals and, most importantly, the
instability of the lira and sterling make it increasingly difficult for this
group to remain within the ERM,' he said.
The yen firmed against the dollar to Y117.70 from Y118.60, and in New York
closed at Y117.58. It will remain buoyed by repatriation of Japanese funds
as the financial year-end approaches on March 31 but may decline after that.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Arizona floods buoy up
vegetable prices in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YUMA COUNTY in south-west Arizona is best known for its dry heat and its
productive agricultural land, but this week its residents are bracing
themselves for a once-in-a-lifetime flood that threatens to put more than
30,000 acres of farmland out of production for a year or more.
The county is the US's primary winter supplier of iceberg lettuce, and the
second-largest vegetable growing region in the country, after central
California. Yuma County growers last week hustled to harvest what remained
of the winter lettuce, broccoli, and cauliflower crops.
The flood has ruffled vegetable marketing channels. Arizona wholesale
lettuce prices doubled last week, to Dollars 20 and Dollars 25 a 24-head
carton, and were sharply above last year's Dollars 4.50 a carton. Wholesale
prices in northern US cities followed the jump and supermarket produce
managers say retail prices will rise to Dollars 1.50 per head, from about 49
to 69 cents this week.
The immediate impact of the flood may only last a few weeks, as buyers shift
toward spring supplies from central California. However, long-term damage in
Yuma county may remain with the market. Mr Hank Giclas, spokesman for the
Western Growers Association, which represents Arizona and California
farmers, said it was too soon to estimate flood damages. 'One thing is sure.
You will see significantly reduced supplies of winter vegetables this year,
and of summer and fall vegetables next year.'
The Gila River, which normally flows gently through Yuma county's flat
lowlands, is swelled by record rains. The river is flooding uncontrolled
over the spillways of the Painted Rock Dam, just south of Phoenix.
Mr Clyde Gould, district manager for the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and
Drainage District, expects the flood to peak sometime this week, leaving the
Gila two miles wide.
'After the peak passes, the water could stand on the land for as much as two
months,' Mr Gould said. 'I would expect production on that land would go out
a minimum of one year.'
Mr Keith Kelly, director of Arizona's Department of Agriculture, estimates
that farmers will lose Dollars 10m in crops as the flood hits, and Dollars
75m in revenues next season.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Eddie Mabo's legacy of fear for
Australian miners - A judgment named after an obscure aborigine is
threatening the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MINING circles, the best known name in Australia is not Paul Keating, the
prime minister, but Eddie Mabo, an obscure aboriginal activist who lived all
his life on an isolated island off the tropical north coast. Mr Mabo, who
died last year, gave his name to a historic judgment by Australia's High
Court which many mining companies claim is a threat to the future of the
resources industry.
Both the Labor government and the conservative opposition have played down
the implications of the Mabo case, partly in order to avoid a damaging row
with aboriginal activists. However, Australia's approaching federal election
has focussed attention on the multitude of questions raised by the case that
will face whichever is in government after polling day, March 13.
The uncertainty flows from a High Court ruling that Mr Mabo's Meriam
aboriginal group owns Murray Island, which lies in the Torres Strait between
Australia and New Guinea. The significance of this is the court's
recognition that a form of 'native title' may exist where ownership of land
has not been explicitly transferred to private hands - for example, by
freehold sale.
The judgment was greeted with jubilation by aboriginal activists because it
extinguishes the constitutional doctrine that Australia was terra nullius,
or unoccupied, when European settlement began in 1788.
In the long-term, the judgment will help to legitimise aboriginal claims
that Australia's indigenous inhabitants were disposessed by British settlers
and may increase pressure on the government to negotiate a treaty. More
immediately, however, it has prompted claims from aborigines and mining
groups alike that other areas, many of which include mines or mining
prospects, may be open to similar land claims.
Already, aboriginal groups have indicated that ownership claims will be made
on much of the Kimberleys region of Western Australia and the Nabalco
bauxite mine at Gove in the Northern Territory. Other claims have been
discussed, though not yet filed, on MIM Holdings' McArthur River
lead/zinc/silver project in the territory and most of central Brisbane, the
state capital of Queensland. More claims are likely according to Mr Mick
Dodson, director of the Northern Land Council, an aboriginal advisory group,
who says 'blanket land claims' across Australia are likely to prove a 'gold
mine' for aborigines.
The ruling was the last straw for many people in the mining industry, which
was already concerned about the federal government's decision to block a
gold project at Coronation Hill because of Aboriginal religious objections.
Sir Arvi Parbo, chairman of Western Mining Corporation, says the ruling
raises doubts about the legality of existing mines and warns that new
projects may be delayed or cancelled.
Ironically, the federal government has made determined efforts over the last
year to overcome unease about the Coronation Hill decision by establishing a
'fast tracking' approval mechanism for major projects. The accelerated
approval procedure is likely to be undermined, however, if projects are made
the subject of land claims relying on the precedent of the Mabo decision.
MIM, for example, received approval within nine months for the ADollars 250m
(Pounds 120m) McArthur River project. It believes it holds legal title to
the area and intends to press on with development.
It is not clear, however, how the title granted under existing legislation
would be affected if the Northern Land Council went ahead with its threat to
file a land claim. This is because the High Court judgment says that native
title exists only where aboriginal groups can prove continuous occupation or
close association with the land being claimed. In addition, the extent of
the native title would depend on the traditional rights of the aborigines
concerned, which might vary from full ownership to hunting or fishing
rights. A further complication is that native title is likely to have been
extinguished by mining titles issued before 1975, most of which effectively
transferred the land to private ownership. However, most mining titles
issued since 1975 would not extinguish native title because of the
provisions of the federal Racial Discrimination Act, which prevents the
abolition of land claim rights without compensation.
Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC's managing director, has called on the federal
government to ease the problem by repealing the Race Discrimination Act.
However, such a step is unlikely because it would breach Australia's
international treaty obligations.
An alternative approach would be for mining companies to reach specific
agreements with local aboriginal groups under which they would trade
compensation for a binding agreement that no land claim would be made.
Zapopan, a small mining company, recently reached such an agreement with the
Jawoyn aborigines which will allow the development of a gold mine at Mount
Todd, about 300 km (180 miles) south of Darwin. Other mining groups say,
however, that this strategy is fraught with danger because of the fragmented
nature of aboriginal society.
'It is impossible to know whether the people signing have the authority to
sign on behalf of all the groups which may have an association with the
area,' says an executive involved in land claims negotiations.
Faced with this uncertainty both the government and the Liberal/National
Party coalition have promised consultations with aboriginal and mining
groups to try to find an agreed solution. The coalition has said it would
legislate 'if necessary', but has not explained how the legislation would
work. Nor has it supported threats by the conservative Northern Territory
government to block land claims by legislation.
Mr Gregory McIntyre, the Perth lawyer who represented Mr Mabo, says it may
be possible to resolve some of the claims by negotiation, or by legislation
that clarifies aboriginal rights. But the complexity of the judgment means
that many cases will have to be decided by the courts, prolonging the
uncertainty for miners and aborigines alike.
'The only alternative would be for the High Court to rule in the next test
case that mining rights extinguish native title (in all cases),' Mr McIntyre
says. 'That would put an ened to all the uncertainty. But if the court rules
favourably for the Aboriginal people then there would be a drawn out process
of claims being made.'

Aluminium prices extended earlier declines during afternoon LME trading,
falling to 3 1/2 -month lows and ending weak, but copper and zinc finished
steady after rallying from depressed morning levels. ALUMINIUM reeled under
speculative fund liquidation, as well as option hedge selling. There is very
little significant consumer interest at present, so further falls are
possible, although the market is becoming oversold, dealers said.
Three-month COPPER edged away from an early 3 1/2 -month low of Dollars
2,139 a tonne, with the market regaining Dollars 2,150 by the close, up
Dollars 4. Technical buying emerged below Dollars 2,150, while heavy
option-related selling was not in evidence. Today's declarations are
expected to be more lively than recent expiries, dealers said. ZINC rallied
strongly in the afternoon, with the fall to a 17-month low of Dollars 993 a
tonne for three-month metal attracting short-covering and bargain-hunting,
although further declines below Dollars 1,000 are likely.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Direst warning yet on state of
Russian oil industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The direst warning yet on the state of the Russian oil industry came
yesterday from Mr Yuri Shafranik, the energy minister, writes John Lloyd in
Moscow.
Mr Shafranik, interviewed in Rossiskaya Gazeta, said that only an injection
of Rbs3 trillion (Dollars 4.6bn) could stop a further production drop of 60m
tonnes this year, from the present level of about 390m tonnes. Even with
this investment, he said, production would fall by some 40m tonnes,
previously said to be the worst estimate.
Foreshadowing a strengthening role of the state in this sector, Mr Shafranik
said that 'instead of disbanding ministries (in the energy sector) we must
strengthen them and give them extra powers'. The Russian government is at
present reorganising the oil sector under the control of five large,
vertically-integrated state companies.
Mr Shafranik, a former head of the main oil-producing region of Tyumen,
revealed that 75 per cent of enterprises were technically bankrupt - but
blamed a structure of pricing that made agriculture profitable and oil
production unprofitable.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Mini-Opec' formed to tackle
CIS energy crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SURGUT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERS of 12 former Soviet republics yesterday formed a 'mini-Opec' in
an effort to resolve their mounting energy crisis. Russian and Ukrainian
representatives at the meeting in the western Siberian city of Surgut also
appeared to make progress on untangling their conflict over oil and gas
prices, which threatens the supply of gas to Europe.
However, while republic's heads agreed in principle to co-operate in an
effort to revive Russia's declining oil industry, they skirted the critical
question of the pricing of the oil and gas Russia supplies to the other
former Soviet republics.
Sounding a conciliatory note, they were optimistic that their agreement to
co-operate in a specific sector of the economy would be more effective than
the dozens of more general, and widely-ignored, decisions made by
Commonwealth of Independent States.
'We have established something similar to the European Steel and Coal
Union,' said Mr Georgy Khizha, the Russian deputy prime minister. He said
that the newly formed association's next step would be to set a uniform
price for oil and gas 'just as in Opec'.
'It is impossible to stop the inflationary spiral without centrally agreed
prices for energy,' Mr Khizha said. He added that the oil and gas
association could serve as a model for inter-republican co-operation in
other sectors, such as the steel and coal industries.
Russian officials warned that the Surgut agreement, intended to channel
investments from the non-Russian republics into the Siberian oil industry,
could make it even more difficult for Western companies to reach deals in
the Russian energy sector.
The association, which will be governed by an oil and gas council made up of
the prime ministers of the member states and administered by a secretariat
based in the Siberian oil capital of Tyumen, will co-ordinate investments
from all of the republics in the Russian oil industry and in exchange
guarantee energy supplies.
Russian oil production, more than 70 per cent of which comes from the Tyumen
region, has fallen sharply from a peak of 557m tonnes in 1988 to 385m tonnes
last year.
The principal reasons for the decline are a drop in investments in the
sector and difficulties in obtaining vital equipment, particularly from
non-Russian republics such as Ukraine and Azerbaijan, which were
traditionally the oil industry's main suppliers.
The spirit of co-operation appeared to be carried over to Ukrainian-Russian
relations, which last week erupted in a bitter dispute over gas prices. Mr
Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian prime minister, said he had reached a
preliminary understanding with Gazprom, the Russian gas company, to pay for
gas at about the same, subsidised, prices Russia charges other CIS
republics. However, Mr Kuchma said the issue would not be definitively
resolved until later in the week when he planned to meet Russian premier
Viktor Chernomyrdin in Moscow.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian grain debt solution
'very close'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISCUSSIONS IN Washington this week between a high-level Russian delegation
and Clinton administration officials aimed at resuming US grain shipments to
Russia have come down to the issue of who is going to pay for freight.
Mr Mike Espy, the US agriculture secretary, said before his final meeting
with the Russians yesterday that his department was 'very close' to an
agreement on the issue, and that he hoped to have a package to offer
President Clinton soon. Mr Bill Clinton and Russia's President Boris Yelstin
will meet for a summit on April 4 and trade groups believe Mr Clinton will
offer a solution to Russia's grain credits problems at that meeting.
Mr Glenn Whiteman, deputy assistant administrator of the US Department of
Agriculture's export credit programmes, said the solution would not include
the resumption of commercial credits, which is what Russian officials have
requested.
Russia has defaulted on Dollars 415.5m in US-backed commercial grain loans,
with Dollars 240.3m more due this month. US grain sales to Russia have
stalled because of the credit problems. While Russia objects to the stigma
attached to receiving food aid, Mr Whiteman said those were the programmes
under consideration. However, any food donation programme tapped for Russia
will require legislation to lift the Dollars 30m cap on what the USDA can
pay to ship donated commodities in a single fiscal year. US humanitarian
shipments of food to Africa and eastern Europe this year have already
reached that level. Russia will either have to come up with hard currency to
pay the freight for grain shipments, or the USDA will have to seek and
exemption.
Since US law requires 75 per cent of US food aid to be shipped on
US-registered vessels, Russia would have to pay higher freight rates than on
commercial shipments.
Mr Dan Basse, a commodities analyst for the consulting group AgResouces,
estimates that the cargo preference requirement would bring freight costs
for shipping Dollars 1bn of US-donated grain to about Dollars 400m.
Money to buy donated commodities is also running short. Two of the three
funding sources for the 'food for progress' programme were nearly exhausted,
Mr Whiteman said. 'Right now we're discussing a variety of programmes.'

FT  03 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palladium prices up on catalyst
news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PALLADIUM prices rose sharply yesterday on news that Allied-Signal of the US
had developed an automoive exhaust catalyst using only palladium. Prices of
platinum, for which catalysts is the biggest single market, fell sharply,
although the New York market was recovering some of the losses in late
trading.
Allied-Signal, a leading catalysts manufacturer with 25 per cent of the
market, said its new system eliminated the need for other platinum group
metals, reducing the cost of precious metal components by up to 50 per cent.
The news should be taken more seriously than previous announcemnts of new
catalytic systems which have moved platinum group metal prices, analysts
suggested. But more details were needed.
In late trading on Nymex yesterday the March palladium contract had
retreated from an earlier Dollars 112.50 a troy ounce to Dollars 109.50, up
Dollars 6.80.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Disappointment with Bundesbank erodes
European gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK yesterday disappointed investors hoping for an early cut in
German money market interest rates, in the process erasing some of the gains
recorded by most European bond markets on Monday.
After weekend comments interpreted as signalling a rate cut this week,
investors had been looking for a significant reduction in the German
repurchase agreement (or repo) rate. However, the Bundesbank returned to a
fixed-rate offer yesterday, from the variable rate tenders it has held for
most of this year, fixing the rate at 8.49 per cent.
This was just one basis point below the last variable rate repo, falling far
short of market hopes of a 10 or even 20 basis point cut.
German bonds retraced some of their gains of recent days, with the yield on
10-year bunds rising to 6.68 per cent. This was seen as a minor set-back
given the strength of the market's rally, however.
The outcome of the repo tender was taken as a sign that the Bundesbank would
not lower its official interest rates at its council meeting this week,
though most commentators still expect such cuts in the near future, once the
terms of the solidarity pact with the eastern German regions has been
completed.
WHILE most European markets followed Germany down, French bonds remained
firm yesterday. This was despite confirmation of this week's 10-year year
bond auction, and the looming French elections.
Ten-year OATs rose on the day, closing the yield spread over German bunds to
around 80 basis points, sharply lower than the 90 basis points on Monday.
'It certainly looks unsustainable at that level,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, an
analyst at Warburg Securities in London.
UK government bonds remained flat yesterday in lacklustre trade. The tap
stock announced on Monday hung over longer-dated bonds, putting a ceiling on
any price rises, while short-dated paper was subdued after comments from the
Governor of the Bank of England dampening hopes of an interest rate cut.
US TREASURY prices were virtually unchanged in the wake of mixed economic
data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/32 at 103
19/32 , yielding 6.836 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
unchanged at 100 1/32 , to yield 3.841 per cent.
Prices were firmer overnight on foreign markets, especially along the middle
of the yield curve, but slipped back from their highs when trading in New
York opened.
Traders blamed the modest selling on the news that US leading economic
indicators gained 0.1 per cent in January. Analysts had been expecting the
indicators to register a small decline.
Sentiment and prices, however, were buoyed by a sharp drop in January new
home sales, which plunged 13.8 per cent during the month, although the
housing figures were offset later in the day by news of strong late January
store sales from the Johnson Redbook service.

FT  03 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Intermediary set up to borrow
for housing providers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET in finance for UK housing associations was widened yesterday with
the creation of the first capitalised intermediary to borrow on their behalf
from UK institutions. Finance for Homes, which has eight
member-associations, successfully placed Pounds 100m of 10 1/8 per cent
debenture stock due 2018 at a yield 160 basis points over UK government
bonds.
Five per cent of the proceeds will be retained in FFH and invested in
gilt-edged stock. The rest will be distributed among the eight
member-associations, secured on the broad spread of their rented housing,
valued on a tenanted investment basis.
Despite the extra security offered by the structure, the bonds did not
command a premium over earlier issues by housing association intermediaries.
A Pounds 51.5m issue from The Housing Finance Corporation, launched last
year, was trading at a yield spread of 157 basis points yesterday, having
advanced since its launch spread of 182 basis points.
'The question for the housing association movement now is what advantage has
this sort of structure given them?' said one banker close to the
transaction.
He added that it was difficult to break the existing market consensus on the
premium housing associations should pay for finance, since only around 10
insurance companies and pension funds are big investors in such issues and
effectively determine the yields offered.
The issue had attracted at least five institutions which had not previously
invested in housing associations, according to Mr Adrian Bell, executive
director of Hambros Bank, which led the issue. However, at least one of the
UK's biggest insurance companies said yesterday that it had yet to take part
in any housing association transaction.
'Some areas of the documentation, such as income definition, could do with
tightening,' said an executive. 'The loan documentations that have come to
the market have not been sufficiently rigorous.'
If one borrower is unable to service the loan, FFH will use the 5 per cent
reserve to service the debt. This would be sufficient to service the debt of
the largest borrower for over two years - long enough, according to Hambros,
which led the issue, for cash-flow problems to be sorted out.
Non-defaulting borrowers would have to restore the reserve, so that members
are on risk to each other for the first 5 per cent of their borrowing.

FT  03 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Belgium and British Gas lead day of
large issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of high-quality borrowers raised large amounts in a variety of
currencies in the international bond market yesterday, but the heavy supply
was readily absorbed.
The Kingdom of Belgium raised DM1bn through a five-year Eurobond issue. The
amount was above market expectations of DM600m and the maturity shorter than
expectations of seven to 10 years. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgium's finance
minister, said that the proceeds would be used to refinance existing D-Mark
borrowings.
The bonds were priced at 99.95 to yield 15 basis points over the series 104
of medium-term German government bonds. When the bonds were freed to trade,
the spread tightened by as much as five basis points before widening out
again to about 12 basis points in the afternoon.
An official at the lead manager, Deutsche Bank, said that Belgium had been
advised to raise a larger amount in order to establish a new five-year
benchmark.
There was above-average demand from the UK and a good proportion was placed
in Switzerland and the Far East. By contrast, the shorter maturity made the
bonds less attractive to German institutions which tend to prefer bonds with
a 10-year life.
The Deutsche official said Belgium had opted for the five-year maturity in
order to reap the cost advantage of the sharp drop in yields at the shorter
end of the German government bond yield curve, prompted by hopes that the
Bundesbank will cut leading interest rates tomorrow.
He noted that Belgium would have had to pay 40 basis points more if it had
opted for a 10-year maturity.
The issuer had also decided against the seven-year area of the yield curve
because it would have had to compete with the EC's recent DM2.9bn Eurobond
issue. The EC's bonds now yield 12 basis points above underlying German
government bonds compared with eight basis points at launch.
The recent widening of sovereign yield spreads on D-Mark Eurobonds,
triggered by the warnings on Italy's foreign currency debt by leading credit
rating agencies, could dissuade similar borrowers from issuing in D-Marks,
the Deutsche official said.
In an active sterling sector, British Gas made its widely-expected
appearance with two issues raising Pounds 200m each, one with a maturity of
10 years and the other with a life of seven years. Both issues were priced
to yield 32 basis points over comparable UK government bonds and the spread
on both issues had tightened slightly by late afternoon.
An official at CSFB, which arranged the deals with Goldman Sachs, said that
investors showed a marginal preference for the 10-year maturity but that
both issues were quickly placed. There was firm demand from continental
European accounts looking for exposure to sterling.
Syndicate managers expect more UK corporate borrowers to tap the
Eurosterling sector in the near future, encouraged by the tightening of
corporate yield spreads.
The European Investment Bank also took advantage of the pent-up demand for
sterling paper and re-opened its Pounds 400m issue of 8 per cent Eurobonds
due 2003, launched in January.
The new tranche of Pounds 200m was priced to yield five basis points over
the 8 per cent UK gilt due 2003 and the spread tightened slightly by late
afternoon. An official at the lead manager, Samuel Montagu, said that most
of the demand for the bonds came from overseas.
Meanwhile, the Province of Ontario launched its first Canadian dollar global
issue and the level of demand was such that the amount was raised from the
minimum CDollars 1bn to CDollars 1.5bn. The bonds, which have a life of 10
years, were priced to yield 93 basis points over comparable Canadian
government bonds, the lower end of the indicated range of 93 to 95 basis
points and within market expectations. By late afternoon, the spread on the
bonds was unchanged.
An official at Merrill Lynch, one of the four joint lead managers, said that
30 per cent of the bonds went to Canada, 10 to 15 per cent to the US, 35 per
cent to Europe and the rest was placed in Asia.

<TEXT>
SWITZERLAND's bourses are likely to adopt a code of reporting standards
later this year which would require the vast majority of Swiss companies to
improve information they make public on their financial health, Reuter
reports from Zurich.
Mr Giorgio Behr, president of the special commission for recommendations on
reporting practices (FER), said: 'With the exception of some 10 groups, all
Swiss companies currently quoted on the bourse will have to change and
improve their reporting practices.'
Switzerland's three bourses are now considering the FER standards and are
likely to adopt them this year, he added.
The standards, which are based on International Accounting Standards and
European Community guidelines, aim to improve the standard of Swiss
corporate reports, more renowned for what they hide rather than reveal.

demand rises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
YUKONG, South Korea's largest oil refining and petrochemical group, has
reported a 19.5 per cent rise in net profits to Won29.3bn (Dollars 37m) for
1992 on sales 17.4 per cent ahead at Won4,721bn.
The sales increase reflected the country's rapid growth in oil consumption.
Earnings improved due to the favourable revision of government-set foreign
exchange rates and base prices applied to crude oil imports.
Yukong also benefited from lower interest rates. The company has heavy
financial expenses following the construction of eight new petrochemical
plants in 1991.
Ssangyong Oil Refining reported net earnings up 114 per cent to Won87.3bn,
while sales rose by 12.4 per cent to Won2,043bn.
The rise in earnings reflected the same financial factors in Yukong's profit
increase.

<TEXT>
BANESTO, one of Spain's 'big six' commercial banks, yesterday announced a 62
per cent fall, to Pta18.3bn (Dollars 150m), in net group profits for 1992,
following an erosion of extraordinary earnings and increased provisions.
The figures include Banesto's industrial holding group, Corporacion Banesto.
Extraordinary earnings, which Banesto usually generates through disposals,
fell from Pta 51.6bn to an extraordinary loss of Pta 1.56bn. The group also
increased provisions by 19 per cent to Pta97.5bn.
The results were largely expected in the markets, which, despite some
criticism of Banesto's rush for retail business in the last two years, have
also expressed satisfaction with the group's conservative provisioning as a
deepening recession in Spain pushes bad debts to record levels.
Even the fall in extraordinary earnings invites conflicting responses. Some
analysts believe the bank should reduce its traditional reliance on non-core
income. Others believe the income Banesto is able to generate from sales of
its banking or industrial assets is vital to the bank maintaining its
profile among foreign investors.
The group's operating margin grew by 14 per cent to Pta228.4bn and it said
that total assets had increased by 5.41 per cent to Pta6,960bn. The group
held the rise in operating costs to under 8 per cent.
The results come as Banesto is poised to make a Dollars 400m rights issue
soon.

THE Johannesburg Stock exchange (JSE) plans to open its Traded Options
Market (TOM) to foreigners and non-residents. Exchange control regulation
currently bar preclude them from the equity options market.
By using TOM, foreigners will be allowed to buy and sell call and put
options on some of the main blue chip shares on the JSE as well as the
all-share index and the all gold index. This list will expand as and when
demand requires it.
Announcing the change, Mr Roy Andersen, JSE executive president, said
foreign investors would earn interest on cash margins remittable at the more
advantageous commercial rand rate of exchange. He said brokers would be able
to service a wider client base. He hoped the hedging and arbitrage
opportunities available would stimulate liquidity in the underlying cash
market.
Foreign clients will trade as ordinary clients of brokers, and may use their
financial rand or blocked rand balances for TOM trading.

HOWARD Smith, the diversified Australian engineering group, yesterday
announced a 4 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 26.7m (USDollars
18.8m) for the six months to the end of December, but warned that the second
half would be tough.
said depressed economic conditions would make it difficult for the group to
equal last year's full-year net profit of ADollars 53.3m.
Mr Moss said the interim result was 'pretty good' in the light of depressed
trading conditions, which affected all the group's activities except
engineering.
The group said sales increased by 14.8 per cent to ADollars 404m, mainly due
to a full half-year contribution from Dunlop Industrial Sales, which was
acquired early last year.
The directors declared a fully-franked interim dividend of 10 cents,
compared to 10 cents unfranked last year. The board said the full-year
dividend would also be fully franked.
Tubemakers of Australia said equity-accounted net profit rose 52 per cent to
ADollars 21m in the six months to the end of December, on sales down 1 per
cent to ADollars 588m.
National Foods, the Australian dairy and groceries group, said net profit
increased by 480 per cent to ADollars 13m on sales up 1 per cent to ADollars
440m. The interim dividend was raised to 2.75 cents, fully franked, from 2.5
cents in the comparable period of the previous year.

OTE, Greece's state-owned telecommunications company, is to offer 14 per
cent of its equity to domestic and international investors in a partial
privatisation.
The offering, the largest so far in Greece, will include an international
tranche of around 5 per cent. It will be aimed at investors in the US and
Europe, according to the government's privatisation unit.
The international tranche will be offered simultaneously with a domestic
tranche of around 5 per cent. The other 4 per cent will be stripped out
earlier and offered on preferential terms to OTE's 28,000 employees. The
government will retain control of 51 per cent.
The share issue will follow the sale of a 35 per cent stake in the company,
together with management rights, to an int-ernational telecommunications
operator. Thirteen groups are in line to bid, with the sale due for
completion by July.
The government has not set a price for OTE, one of the few profitable Greek
state enterprises. Analysts have valued the 14 per cent stake at around
Dr90bn (Dollars 409m).
Last month, 24 international banks and security houses were invited to
submit bids to act as global co-ordinator and lead manager. N M Rothschild,
the government's privatisation adviser, is assisting in the selection
process.
Thailand is about to embark on its first privatisation with the flotation of
PTT Exploration and Production, part of the state-owned Petroleum Authority
of Thailand. The public offering of just under 40m shares at Baht 33 per
share (Dollars 1.29) represents about 15 per cent of PTTEP's total capital.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE of 36 per cent in underwriting surplus helped Mutual &amp; Federal, South
Africa's largest short-term insurer, lift net income by 16 per cent to
R77.2m (Dollars 24.9m) in the six months to the end of September, from
R66.6m a year earlier.
The result reflects the continuation of a turnaround in South Africa's
insurance sector which has been under way for more than a year, following a
period when short-term insurers were hit by uncompetitive rates, a number of
natural disasters, and spiralling crime rates.
This improvement is reflected in an increase of about 70 per cent in the
insurance index on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange over the past year.
Gross premiums rose 13 per cent to R645.2m from R573.5m and net premiums
advanced 14 per cent to R548.4m from R482.4m. The underwriting surplus rose
to R34.6m from R25.4m. Mr Ken Saggers, managing director, said the
improvement resulted from stringent expense control and the absence of
natural catastrophes.
He added, however, that the group's commercial and industrial portfolios
remained highly competitive and underrated - to the tune of about 15 per
cent - while high levels of crime-related losses remained a concern.

licences

<TEXT>
THAILAND has granted offshore banking (OBU) licences to 47 local and foreign
banks, out of more than 50 applicants, as part of a scheme aimed at making
the country a regional financial centre.
The Thai finance ministry said those granted licences under the Bangkok
International Banking Facility (BIBF) include 12 foreign banks with branches
in Thailand, 20 foreign banks with representative offices or with no prior
presence, and all 15 local commercial banks.
Foreign bankers had assumed that fewer than 10 of the Thai banks would be
granted OBU licences because the smaller operations might be unable to meet
required capital adequacy ratios.
Under BIBF, banks will be able to take advantage of tax incentives for
regional activities, although it is not clear if Thailand will be able to
compete against centres in Singapore and Hong Kong.
The corporate income tax rate under BIBF will be 10 per cent instead of the
usual 30 per cent. Bangkok Bank said in a research paper that BIBF would
reduce the cost of foreign funds brought in to finance the Thai current
account deficit.

PLANS to liberalise Japan's financial markets by allowing banks to compete
in securities markets are seriously inadequate, Mr Yukio Aida, the chairman
of Nomura Securities, said yesterday.
Mr Aida warned that Japan was missing an opportunity for a thorough review
of how to reform its financial markets in the wake of the speculative
economy of the late 1980s by introducing an unsatisfactory compromise
designed to support the banks
His comments are public confirmation of the ferocity of the struggle between
banks and securities companies which are attempting to influence the
government's policy on financial liberalisation. Securities companies allege
the banks are being given favourable treatment to support them while they
deal with their bad loans.
Under the plans the commercial banks will be allowed to set up subsidiaries
to deal in parts of the securities markets. The plans were drawn up in the
late 1980s when the Tokyo stock market was booming. Since then trading
volumes have fallen dramatically and most of Japan's stockbrokers expect to
make large losses this year.
Mr Aida was speaking at a seminar on co-operation between British and
Japanese financial institutions organised by British Invisibles, a trade
group which promotes UK financial and other services abroad.
He said: 'I am sceptical of such a reform when the securities industry is in
such a dire predicament.'
As an example of the alleged unfairness of the reforms Mr Aida pointed out
that the banks will be allowed to lead manage bond issues by Japanese
companies in foreign markets, while securities companies will not be allowed
into foreign exchange markets in Tokyo. Mr Aida criticised the banks'
substantial shareholdings in industrial compan-ies.
He said these cross shareholdings gave the banks great influence over their
industrial clients which they could use to attract business.
Japanese bankers speaking at the seminar dismissed Mr Aida's warnings. Mr
Yoh Kurosawa, president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, said the reforms
would revive the pre-second world war system in which banks had securities'
businesses.
Mr Kurosawa, in a thinly veiled comment on the securities scandals which
rocked the Tokyo stock market two years ago, said: 'We are aware the Tokyo
stock market has its particular practices. We are anxious to learn from Mr
Aida about those practices.'
Mr Tasuki Takagaki, Bank of Tokyo president, said commercial banks initially
would not compete intensely in the securities market because of the extent
of their problems with bad debts.
Mr Takagaki said the non-performing loans would probably provoke management
crises at some smaller institutions which would be taken over by larger
groups.
However he said this would not threaten the banking system as a whole.

as costs rise

<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea's five main motor vehicle producers reported mixed, but
generally worse, results for 1992 in spite of some increases in sales.
The drop in earnings re-flected higher costs as manufacturers offered
low-interest consumer loans to revive sluggish domestic demand.
They also had increased costs associated with the production and marketing
of several new car models.
Hyundai Motor, the biggest Korean motor company, said net profits fell by 23
per cent to Won41.6bn (Dollars 52m), although sales rose by 8.5 per cent to
Won6,079bn.
Sales and profits were harmed in the last two months of 1992 as employees
became involved in the presidential campaign of Mr Chung Ju-yung, the
Hyundai founder, causing sales activity to slacken. Hyundai was able to
balance sluggish sales in South Korea and the US, traditionally its largest
foreign market, by increasing exports to Europe, which became its biggest
overseas customer last year.
Kia Motors reported a 5.7 per cent decline in net profits to Won14.95bn as
sales rose by 20 per cent to Won3,282bn. Earnings were depressed by costs
involved with the introduction of the Potentia luxury car and the
medium-range Sephia. It also had heavy investment spending in expanding
production at its Asan Bay facility.
Daewoo Motors, which is unlisted, continued to post losses. Its deficit
shrank to Won90bn from Won146.7bn in 1991. Sales increased by 6.5 per cent
to Won1,700bn.
Asia Motors, which is a specialised manufacturer of commercial vehicles and
affiliated with Kia Motors, suffered a 29 per cent fall in profits to
Won7.4bn as demand weakened because of a downturn in the construction
industry. Sales remained almost unchanged at Won970bn.
Ssangyong Motor slipped into a deficit of Won8.75bn after registering a
profit of Won9.38bn in 1991. Sales also fell by 15 per cent to Won340.8bn.
The reverse was largely caused by increased competition in the market for
the four-wheel drive vehicles, which Ssangyong monopolised until last year
with its Korando model. The introduction of the Galloper by Hyundai
Precision, a manufacturer of rolling stock and containers, sharply reduced
Ssangyong's market share.

ROYAL Bank of Canada, the largest of Canada's big six chartered banks,
yesterday reported little-changed net profits for the first quarter.
The bank, which is negotiating the acquisition of the trust operations of
Royal Trustco, recorded net profit for the quarter of CDollars 254m
(USDollars 211m), or 71 cents a share, in the first quarter of fiscal 1993.
This compares with CDollars 256m, or 73 cents, a year earlier. There were
more shares outstanding in the latest period.
Lower non-interest expense and larger payments received on Brazilian loans
were offset by higher domestic loan loss provisions and lower fee income.
Loan loss provisions totalled CDollars 295m, increased significantly to
cover problems in the corporate sector. A year earlier, the provision was
CDollars 185m. The bank now estimates provisions for fiscal 1993 at CDollars
820m, up CDollars 120m on the estimate at October 31 last.
Return on average assets was 0.73 per cent, against 0.76 per cent, and on
equity 14.8 per cent against 14.5 per cent.
Total assets at January 31 were CDollars 137bn, up 2 per cent from a year
earlier. If the Royal Trustco acquisition is consummated, the deal would
bring the bank's total assets to nearly CDollars 200bn.
The Toronto commercial property market deteriorated further in the latest
quarter, but retail banking, investment banking, treasury and investment
management performed as planned.
BANKS will refinance about Dollars 326m of term debt of Camdev, the former
Campeau Corporation property group.
The banks have agreed to roll-over existing loans to Camdev for up to four
years, secured by Camdev stock in a profitable US regional grocery chain and
office properties in Ottawa and London, Ontario.
BANK of Nova Scotia reported first-quarter net profit of CDollars 165m, or
70 cents a share, down about 5 per cent from CDollars 174m, or 76 cents, a
year earlier.
Return on assets was 0.65 per cent against 0.77 per cent and on equity 14.6
per cent against 16.9 per cent. Total assets at January 31 were CDollars
98bn, up nearly 5 per cent.

CHARGEURS, the French textiles-to-media group, reported nearly doubled
profits for last year but warned that 1993 would be 'very difficult', writes
William Dawkins in Paris.
Net profits rose from FFr366m (Dollars 66m) in 1991 to FFr724m, but this was
helped by a FFr410m capital gain from the sale of Chargeurs' 12.9 per cent
in UTA to Air France.
The result implies an earnings fall from the first to the second half of the
year. Chargeurs reported a FFr712m net profit in the first six months of
1992, up from FFr404m in the same period of 1991.
Stripping out exceptional items, amortisation costs and contributions from
disposals, last year's profits rose on a comparable basis from FFr246m to
FFr365m.

<TEXT>
DFDS, the Danish shipping and haulage group, returned annual pre-tax profits
of DKr100m (Dollars 11m) compared with DKr144m in the previous 12 months.
Sales rose to DKr5.93bn from DKr5.33bn in the corresponding period.
An unchanged dividend of DKr60 per share - 6 per cent - was proposed.
The board attributed the slide in profits to the slump in leading markets,
including the UK and Sweden, and to the devaluations of the Swedish krona
and sterling against the Danish currency.
Passenger traffic on the Scandinavian Seaways ferries to the UK was down.
The Tor Line freight service was adversely affected by conditions in Sweden
and in Britain.
The increase in sales was attributed by the company to an improvement in the
haulage division, which has strengthened its position in the European
markets.
This year will be a difficult one due to the slump in main markets, the
group said.
It predicted a further reduction in operating profits.

AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph expects total capital spending for this

worldwide intelligence network to exceed last year's Dollars 3bn, the
company said in its annual report, AP-DJ reports.
The group added that it had not yet decided whether to adopt in 1993 or 1994
the new accounting standard for disability and other benefits provided to
former employees.
It is required to adopt the standard by January 1994. AT&amp;T said it could not
reasonably estimate the financial impact of the change.

<TEXT>
FORENINGSBANKEN, the Swedish co-operative bank, saw its operating loss rise
to SKr1.35bn (Dollars 175m) last year from SKr907m, as credit losses rose to
SKr3.50bn from SKr2.79bn.
The bank said it would need to strengthen its capital base in the autumn
through a new share issue, after its capital adequacy ratio fell to 8.1 per
cent at the year-end. The government has announced the bank is entitled to
state support through guarantees.
Bad debts accounted for 3.8 per cent of total lending in 1992 and mainly
related to real estate and small and medium-sized companies. Problem credits
amounted to SKr8.9bn at the year-end.
The bank said it expected to remain in the red this year, warning 'there is
a substantial risk that loan losses will remain high'.

CINCINNATI Milacron, the US machine tool group, is restructuring its
newly-acquired subsidiary, Valenite, with the closure of nine plants,
including two in Brazil and one in Mexico, and net job cuts of about 480,
AP-DJ reports from Cincinnati.
The company said the restructuring would improve Valenite's profitability by
lowering working capital requirements, reducing overall expenses, increasing
plant modernisation and improving capacity utilisation.
Costs associated with the restructuring, to be substantially completed this
year, were provided for at the time of the acquisition in February. As a
result, there would be no special charges, Milacron said.
Of Valenite's 27 facilities worldwide, nine will close. Those plants are in
Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Australia, two in Brazil, Italy, Mexico, and the
UK.
Two plants in Michigan and Canada will be reduced in size.
Four operations, including plants in South Carolina, Texas, France and
Germany, will receive additional work.

<TEXT>
K MART, the US retail group which operates around 2,400 discount stores as
well as several chains of specialist stores, yesterday reported a 9.5 per
cent increase in after-tax profits for the year to January 27.
However same-store sales growth for the group overall was a modest 2.6 per
cent.
The company made after-tax profits of Dollars 941m in the 52-week period, up
from Dollars 859m in the previous year.
After-tax profits in the fourth, and most important, quarter rose by 11.7
per cent, to Dollars 535m. Earnings per share increased more modestly. Due
to an issue of equity-based securities in 1991, the figure for the last
quarter increased to Dollars 1.15 from Dollars 1.06, while for the year it
was up by 2 per cent at Dollars 2.06.
Total sales in the final quarter increased from Dollars 10.6bn to Dollars
11.5bn. For the year, there was a 9.1 per cent increase to Dollars 37.7bn.
K mart said that its gross margin for the year had slipped to 24.5 per cent
of sales, compared with 25 per cent. This reflected 'increased clearance
markdowns of spring and summer merchandise lines, especially apparel'.
K mart also noted that there was a greater sales contribution from its PACE
warehouse club chain, where margins are particularly low.
However, K mart added that the margin pressure had been greatest early in
the year and that there had been an 'excellent sell-through' of seasonal
merchandise during the Christmas season.
In the main general merchandise division, comparable store sales rose by a
modest 1.5 per cent, although operating profits increased by 11.9 per cent
to Dollars 1.56bn.
The specialty retail chains overall saw a 5.7 per cent rise in same-store
sales, with operating profits rising 10.7 per cent to Dollars 1.81bn.
The one problem area was PACE, which saw operating profits fall from Dollars
39m to Dollars 3m. K mart said the profits erosion stemmed from poor
performance of new outlets opened in 1991 and 1992, but that it expected an
improvement this year.

<TEXT>
FOKUS BANK, Norway's third biggest commercial bank, announced yesterday that
1992 pre-tax losses, before extraordinary items, had been sharply reduced to
NKr426m (Dollars 60m) from NKr2.1bn in 1991.
The substantial improvement was due to an increase in operating income, a
reduction in operating costs and a significant cut in credit losses.
Fokus said that, according to its strategic plan, it is set to return to
profit within two years.
It charged 1992 accounts with NKr480m for restructuring, against NKr40m in
1991, which took net losses for the year down to NKr907m, from NKr1.884bn in
1991. It said state cash transfers had enabled it to undertake the
far-reaching restructuring.
Fokus wrote down the value of its property portfolio by NKr168m to NKr2.6bn
last year, against a write-off of NKr425m a year earlier to NKr3.3bn. Net
interest income fell by NKr174m to NKr1.1bn as operating income increased to
NKr571m from NKr543m.
Fokus said that interest income was lower than had been earlier anticipated,
due to unrest last year in foreign currency markets. Operating costs fell by
NKr304m to NKr1.332bn last year.
Group operating profit, before credit losses and write-offs, rose sharply
last year to NKr323m from NKr165m in 1991.

FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: NWA offers staff equity for wage
concessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHWEST Airlines, the indebted US carrier in which KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines holds a minority share stake, has offered its employees a 20 per
cent equity interest in the company in return for substantial wage
concessions.
Northwest said the proposal was 'the company's best offer for a revised
compensation plan'. The lack of progress in talks with unions prompted
speculation that the airline might file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, but Northwest has denied this.
It asked labour leaders to agree to the plan by March 10.
The company is asking contract employees - including its pilots, flight
attendants and mechanics - for cost savings of about Dollars 883m over three
years. Management and non-contract employees would contribute Dollars 92m.
The savings would come from wage reductions, employee contributions to
medical and dental insurance plans, and holiday accrual rate reductions.
In return, Northwest is offering employees a 20 per cent equity stake and
three seats on a 15-strong board of directors. This would match the three
representatives appointed by KLM, which would see its share stake diluted
pro rata.
Once the employee wage concessions are in place, Northwest will attempt a
financial restructuring. If it has not obtained Dollars 500m of new
permanent capital by the end of June 1995, the employees' stake could
increase to 51 per cent of the equity.

fraud claim
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of bondholders in Marriott Corporation, the US hotels and food
services group which is planning to split itself into two separately-quoted
companies, intends to step up its securities fraud litigation against the
company.
The bondholder action is led by PPM America, part of the British Prudential
insurance company's investment management division, which holds around
Dollars 200m in Marriott bonds - largely on behalf of Jackson National Life
Insurance Company, the Prudential's US insurance subsidiary.
The demerger scheme involves spinning off the more profitable operational
businesses and leaving most of the group's debt, along with the property
assets, in a separate company.
Marriott bonds dropped sharply as a result, although the group's shares have
soared.
Some bondholders, including PPM America, sued Marriott, charging that the
company failed to disclose its restructuring plan when it was selling new
debt issues to investors last year.
Some of the big US institutional bondholders, however, are negotiating with
Marriott, with a view to a settlement.

HEWLETT-Packard, the US computers and electronics manufacturer, is to move
worldwide responsibility for the development and manufacture of large-scale
printers and plotters to Barcelona, Spain, from San Diego, California.
The move is part of an expansion programme and there will not be any job
losses in San Diego.
The company said it would invest more than Pta1.8bn (Dollars 15.3m) over the
next two years to build a new 8,000 square metre plant at its Barcelona
site.
The 300 - strong workforce is expected to double by the end of 1994.
Industry consultants estimate that the the value of plotters manufactured in
Spain will be Dollars 300m a year by 1994.
Research and development, marketing and manufacturing will all be moved to
Spain from the US.
Hewlett-Packard is a leading manufacturer of large - scale plotters and
printers, which are used to create arch-itectural and engineering drawings.
The company also said it intended to concentrate the manufacture of inkjet
printers, where it is market leader, for the European market in Barcelona
within two years.
HP will continue to make inkjet printers in Vancouver, Washington, and
Singapore.
Hewlett-Packard has been manufacturing plotters in Barcelona since 1985.
A spokesman said the company had been encouraged to develop further in the
region by the quality of components from local suppliers, by the local
workforce and by financial incentives.
The company has two other sites which manufacture products for a global
market: Andover, Massachusetts, produces medical systems; and South
Queensferry, Scotland, makes telecommunications instrumentation.

KONGSBERG OFFSHORE, the Norwegian-based supplier of undersea oil and gas
production systems, is to be acquired by FMC Corporation of the US.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Siemens of Norway, the offshoot of the
German group which owns Kongsberg, expects the deal to be completed by the
end of the second quarter of this year.
FMC, which supplies chemicals and equipment to the oil, gas and agriculture
industries, said the acquisition would strengthen its position in the
underwater systems market.
The US group has co-operated with Kongsberg Offshore since 1987, with the
latter supplying electronic controls for FMC-produced underwater oil and gas
production equipment.
Siemens Norway said undersea production technology was not a core business
area of the group, which had decided to concentrate on its core businesses.
The deal is subject to approval by the two companies' boards of directors
and Norwegian authorities.

<TEXT>
AGGREGATE premium income at Generali, Italy's biggest insurance company,
surged by 53.6 per cent to almost L17,000bn (Dollars 10.86bn) last year,
against L10,964bn in 1991, due to the weaker lira and a big new Spanish
venture.
Adjusted for currency factors and the new venture, aggregate premiums rose
by 14.9 per cent, the company said.
The preliminary figures come as Generali shares rose sharply on the Milan
stock exchange following Monday's decision by the Italian government to open
the door to the creation of private pension funds, which are expected to
boost sharply the profits of the country's leading insurers.
Generali gave no indications of its net profits or dividend for 1992, which
will only be revealed after a board meeting in early May. In 1991, group net
earnings before minority interests rose to L672.2bn.
Premiums on directly written Italian business rose to L4,070bn last year,
with an 11.9 per cent increase to L1,496bn on the life side and a rise of
7.6 per cent to L2,574 in non-life business.
Directly-written foreign business jumped by 37.6 per cent to L1,661bn,
thanks partly to the weaker lira. Adjusted for currency factors, the
increase was 20.4 per cent. Indirectly-written business climbed by 21 per
cent to L2,768bn.

POLYGRAM, the music company which is 80 per cent owned by Philips of the
Netherlands, reported net income up 13 per cent to Fl 506m (Dollars 273.3m)
in 1992, with a strong US performance off-setting a downturn in most of
Europe, Japan and Brazil.
Net sales were up 5 per cent to Fl 6.6bn, with popular music accounting for
69 per cent of revenues compared with 70 per cent in 1991. Classical music
accounted for only 14 per cent of revenues last year, compared with 17 per
cent in 1991.
Film accounted for 8 per cent of revenues last year, compared with 5 per
cent in 1991. PolyGram last year paid Dollars 35m for a 51 per cent stake in
the film producer Interscope. It also purchased the 51 per cent it did not
already own of Propaganda Films.
Income from operations rose 7 per cent to Fl 789m. Net income per share was

FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Norsk Data to de-list shares
during debt talks

NORSK Data shares will be de-listed for up to two months as urgent
debt-restructuring talks continue.
Norsk Data, the troubled Norwegian computer service group, has estimated
debt of NKr650m (Dollars 92.75m), plus an outstanding NKr350m German bearer
bond programme. The Oslo bourse said yesterday it was unclear what
implications a debt restructuring solution would have for Norsk Data's share
capital and ownership structure.
The group has returned losses for the past five years. In 1991, losses were
NKr810m against losses of NKr134m in the previous 12 months.
Trading in Norsk Data was suspended three weeks ago when the group said it
hoped to conclude talks with creditors by yesterday. Norsk Data is listed in
Oslo, London and New York and its shares are traded, in the form of
depository receipts, in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Hamburg.
'Norsk Data and the main financial creditors have reached a common
understanding concerning the . . . long-term debt situation. A final
agreement offering a dividend to all creditors is expected to be formalised
before the end of March,' the company said.
Mr Carl Espen Wollebekk, senior vice-president, treasury, was optimistic
that a deal would be concluded with Norsk Data's creditors by the end of the
month. He said once the deal was settled, Norske Data could publish its 1992
result. It was due yesterday.
Norsk Data reported that Nordic Data, a holding company set up in September
1991 with the same corporate management as Norsk Data, had a 1992 profit of
NKr92m on turnover of NKr806m.
Nordic Data's assets were NKr547m at the end of 1992 and total equity at
NKr260m, corresponding to an equity-to-debt ratio of 48 per cent.
'The Nordic Data group has about 850 employees and the long-term strategy is
to further develop the group within the profitable segments of the computer
service business. Nordic Data's strong financial position will be a
guarantee for future long-term business relationships,' it said.
Mr Wollebekk said Nordic Data's figures were reported in an effort to calm
the market about the temporary delisting.

SPAIN'S Banco Central Hispanoamericano has joined the push by Spanish banks
into Portugal through a share swap with with Banco Comercial Portugues.
Under the agreement announced yesterday, BCH has taken 10 per cent of BCP
which, in turn, has taken 2 per cent of BCH and 50 per cent of Banco Banif
Gestion Privada, a BCH 'boutique' bank that caters for wealthy clients.
The operation is thought to be the biggest share exchange between Spanish
and Portuguese institutions. BCH bought 9.14m shares in BCP at Esc2,500 each
while BCP acquired 3.4m BCN shares at Monday's closing price in Madrid of
Pta3,300.
It also marks the boldest advance made by a Portuguese bank into Spanish
territory. Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, BCP chairman, is likely to be given a
seat on the BCH board next month.
BCH, Spain's biggest bank in terms of assets, and BCP said they were looking
forward to 'long term co-operation' and that they 'share a similar
philosophy of performance both in the Portuguese and Spanish markets.'
It is not clear whether BCH plans to use its BCP stake merely as a source of
dividends or whether it will try to operate in some way in Portugal through
the BCP association. BCH has just reported a dramatic 22 per cent fall in
net profits last year, to Pta52.6bn.

into red
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NORSKE Skogindustrier, Norway's biggest pulp and paper producer, yesterday
unveiled its first annual loss, and warned of up to 450 further job cuts as
part of a programme to reduce costs by NKr200m (Dollars 20m).
Norske Skog reported a 1992 pre-tax loss of NKr662m against a profit of
NKr480m in 1991 and will not pay a dividend after paying NKr2 a share a year
earlier.
The weak performance was due to foreign currency losses on loans,
restructuring costs and a NKr191m loss suffered by Papeteries de Golbey, a
French newsprint mill of which the company owns 49 per cent.
Norske Skog's A shares closed down NKr1.50 at NKr85 in Oslo.
'The international forest products industry is experiencing the longest and
deepest recession since 1945,' Norske Skog said, adding that there was a
sharp fall in prices for most of its main products.
Group sales fell to NKr7.83bn last year from NKr8.97bn in 1991, but
operating costs were cut to NKr7.10bn from Nkr7.79bn. Norske Skog charged
1992 accounts with NKr200m for restructuring, against a charge of NKr130m in
1991. Minority interests in affiliated companies showed a loss of NKr183m
last year, against a NKr23m profit in 1991. Net financial items of NKr432m
were charged against 1992 accounts, compared with NKr143m in 1991.
Norske Skog posted a NKr228m unrealised foreign exchange loss on loans, and
said that NKr160m could be attributed to December's devaluation of the
krone. In sharp contrast, the group achieved a NKr80m foreign currency gain
in 1991. The group plunged into an operating loss of NKr47m in 1992, against
a profit of NKr500m in 1991.
Mr Arnfinn Hofstad, Norske Skog chief executive, issued a cautiously
optimistic view for the group's prospects in 1993, but nevertheless warned
the result this year would be poor.

FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley president to step
down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN Stanley, the Wall Street securities house, announced yesterday that
Mr Robert Greenhill will step down as the firm's president this summer to
concentrate on his work as an adviser on client transactions.
Mr John Mack, head of Morgan Stanley's operating committee which oversees
the day-to-day running of the firm, will become the new president on June
10, when the company holds its annual meeting. Mr Greenhill will remain on
the board of directors.
Mr Richard Fisher, Morgan Stanley chairman, said the changes at the top
would not affect the firm's business strategy or management style.
Along with Mr Fisher, Mr Greenhill and Mr Mack have held the reins at Morgan
Stanley for several years, guiding the firm through its evolution into a
global investment banking and securities trading powerhouse.
In recent years, however, Mr Greenhill's role as president, with its
management and administrative responsibilities, has clashed with his work as
a deal-maker and adviser to Morgan Stanley's biggest clients, which kept him
away from the firm's New York head office for long stretches of time.
In the past year alone, Mr Greenhill has taken the lead role in advising
General Motors on its several billion-dollar stock issues; worked with RJR
Nabisco on its plan to sell shares in its worldwide food business (a plan
that was formally unveiled yesterday); and advised International Business
Machines, the troubled computer company, on its massive restructuring.
Mr Greenhill said that after stepping down as president he would devote most
of his attention to working with these and other clients.
He will not, however, necessarily be working full-time at Morgan Stanley. Mr
Greenhill said some of his time will be spent on personal interests.

FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: BP to sell Australian mining
interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum has agreed to sell its 49 per cent interest in the Olympic
Dam mining project in South Australia to Western Mining Corporation, the
Australian resource group, for USDollars 240m. The agreement follows Western
Mining's decision to exercise its pre-emptive option to acquire the stake.
WMC, which owns 51 per cent of Olympic Dam, had until tomorrow to decide
whether to match a similar offer from Minorco, the overseas investment arm
of the Anglo-American Corporation-De Beers group of South Africa.
The deal to sell the mining project, which includes 450m tonnes of copper,
uranium, gold and silver deposits, will take BP out of minerals mining
altogether. But BP still has a 50 per cent stake in an Indonesian coal mine
which it will retain.
WMC said its total outlay would be Dollars 430m after paying Dollars 190m to
BP to buy out loans worth Dollars 273m. It said debt would increase by only
Dollars 157m because most of the cost would be financed from existing
resources.
The deal ends an joint venture arrangement which required BP to finance an
increase in annual production from 66,000 tonnes of copper to 150,000 tonnes
and 1,400 tonnes of uranium oxide to 4,000 tonnes.
WMC said it was reconsidering existing plans for a modest expansion to
84,000 tonnes of copper and 1,500 tonnes of uranium oxide over the next
three years at a cost of ADollars 75m (USDollars 51.00)
But the full expansion programme, which is expected to cost between ADollars
500m and ADollars 750m, was unlikely to proceed until later in the decade
unless there was a substantial improvement in uranium prices.
WMC said it was 'well placed' to finance the acquisition and future
expansion in addition to a commitment announced last week to invest ADollars
440m in the development of the Mount Keith nickel deposit in Western
Australia.
The group said it expected net debt to increase from zero to about ADollars
600m by 1993-94, equivalent to 20 per cent of equity. 'No equity issue is
contemplated or will be required,' the board said.
WMC shares fell 5 cents to ADollars 4.71 on the Australian Stock Exchange as
investors considered the impact of the deal on the group's ability to
finance its future commitments.

DISCUSSIONS between KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines are not expected to
result in a merger, Mr Harald Norvik, SAS chairman, expects.
Speaking at an industry forum in Bergen, Norway, he stressed that the
airlines were looking to co-operate more closely rather than combine.
There had been speculation that the four airlines might eventually merge
following last Friday's announcement that they were launching detailed talks
on the feasibility of setting up a 'global airline system'.
Mr Norvik said: 'The talks are aiming to establish if the conditions exist
for discussions on closer co-operation, and I don't think that a
collaboration would lead to a merger. The issue is what degree of
co-operation and co-ordination would be appropriate.' He said SAS was not
holding talks with any other airlines.
SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines already co-operate through a loose
grouping known as the European Quality Alliance, which involves joint
marketing activities and co-ordination of timetables.
It first became clear that KLM was interested in partnership talks with the
EQA airlines in late January.
Last Friday, the four groups said they were setting up joint working groups
to explore opportunities more closely.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sale sign erected over Cornerstone - Estate
agency loss totals Pounds 226m since acquisition in 1987
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL yesterday disclosed that it had lost a total of Pounds 226m
on estate agency since it acquired its business in 1987.
The company now intends to sell the Cornerstone residential estate agency,
which has 355 branches.
The loss comprises Pounds 88m in total operating losses over five years, and
Pounds 126m in goodwill written off to reserves as well as a further Pounds
12m in restructuring costs in 1992.
Sir Christopher Tugendhat, Abbey chairman, said that the company had bought
the estate agency chain to protect its share of the mortgage lending market.
But its agents referred no more business proportionately than
intermediaries.
'The essential reason for buying it was to defend our flank. Since then, we
have discovered that it does not have that strategic advantage,' said Sir
Christopher.
The goodwill write-off, which was taken as an exceptional item because Abbey
is now complying with the FRS 3 reporting standard, leaves only Pounds 15m
of goodwill in reserves. Some Pounds 141m of goodwill was taken into
reserves on acquisition.
Abbey's decision to dispose of its estate agency business, which made a
trading loss of Pounds 20m (Pounds 19m) in 1992, contrasts with building
societies which are holding on to lossmaking chains in the hope that they
will return to profit.
The Cornerstone residential estate agency business, which achieved a small
increase in the number of houses sold, closed a further 59 branches as part
of rationalisation, compared with 16 branch closures in 1991.
Sir Christopher said it was 'always difficult to see the best of times or
the worst of times to sell something'. But Abbey believed it was sensible to
sell now amid signs of the housing market 'coming out of the doldrums'.
Abbey currently gains Pounds 500m a year of mortgage business through the
Cornerstone chain.
However, Sir Christopher said that Abbey had found it was getting a similar
flow of business through other estate agents that it did not own.
A large number of building societies - as Abbey was in 1987 - started to
acquire estate agency chains as a defensive measure because they believed
that their share of mortgage lending was threatened by new lenders.
Mr Peter Birch, Abbey chief executive, said that this fear proved to be
illusory. 'If we went back to that time, we would probably do the same thing
again. I hope that we would not do, but I think we probably would,' he said.
Woolwich Building Society disclosed last week that its Woolwich Property
Services estate agency business, which has 257 offices and is the seventh
largest corporate estate agent in Britain, incurred a trading loss of Pounds
11m during 1992.
If Abbey is unable to dispose of the chain as a whole, it will sell branches
in regional blocks.
It believes it will be able to achieve a higher price than the Pounds 15m of
goodwill remaining its its reserves after the write-off.
Abbey's move is one of the largest attempted disposals of a corporate chain
since Prudential disposed of or closed more than 500 of its branches during
1990.
Abbey is advised on the sale by Kleinwort Benson.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Russell Hobbs recovery helps Pifco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RETURN to the black at Russell Hobbs Tower helped Pifco, the electrical
appliances group, report a 79 per cent increase in profits for the half year
to October 31.
Profits rose from Pounds 577,000 to Pounds 1.03m pre-tax on sales down from
Pounds 21.8m to Pounds 20.4m.
Mr Michael Webber, chairman, said the fall in turnover reflected the group's
drive for profitability over market share.
Extensive surgery had returned RHT to profitability for the first time since
the company was bought from the administrators of Polly Peck International
in April 1991. In the 28 months before the acquisition it incurred losses of
Pounds 31m.
Mr Webber said: 'There is still more to be done in changing the culture of
the company. There is no quick fix.'
Export sales to some 40 countries accounted for almost a quarter of revenue.
Within five years the group hopes that half of turnover will be generated by
exports.
Tight control over working capital and overhead costs resulted in nil
gearing.
Earnings per share rose to 11.8p (6.9p). The interim dividend is maintained
at 3.5p.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Analysts search for 'headline' earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING financial analysts yesterday called for companies to provide a new
'headline' earnings figure in their annual accounts which would show their
trading performance.
In a widely circulated draft, the Institute of Investment Management and
Research, formerly the Society of Investment Analysts, calls for the
publication of a new figure which strips out the effect of profits or losses
on capital items.
The proposal has been generated by the changes brought about by FRS 3, the
new accountancy standard on the profit and loss account, which places all
elements of company performance above the line, or before the earnings
figure.
However, the standard also leaves scope for companies to quote a second
earnings figure on a different basis, and the institute is hoping that its
own version will become an industry standard.
The headline figure would remove all profits or losses including the tax
effects of goodwill, prior year adjustments, the costs of eliminating
discontinued operations, and the sale of fixed assets or businesses except
those bought for resale.
The idea is to provide a universally adopted figure which would be robust,
factual and reflect a company's trading position during the year.
The institute is holding discussions with the Stock Exchange which could
lead to an amendment to the 'Yellow Book' of listing requirements for quoted
companies, and would require them to include the new figure in their
preliminary announcements.
The headline earnings figure is also likely to be partially adopted by the
Financial Times, which will mention it in company results stories and may
adopt it as the basis for calculating price/earnings ratios.
Other organisations such as Extel will also adopt the headline figure in
their stories.
The new figure was produced by a sub-committee created by the institute on
the day the final version of FRS 3 was published late last year.
Originally it proposed a 'maintainable' earnings figure which would have
attempted to show a company's future profitability. But it concluded that it
was impossible to derive such a figure consistently since so much depended
on judgment.
Mr David Damant, chairman of the committee, said: 'A definition of earnings
refers to a number chosen for a specified purpose. One number cannot do
everything.'
He added that calculating a maintainable earnings figure would remain the
preserve of individual analysts and research firms.
The institute's exposure draft supports the idea of FRS 3 as 'realistic and
constructive'. But it says there will continue to be the need for an
earnings figure as an unambiguous reference point which encapsulates a
company's performance.
The institute's proposals are out for consultation until April 30.
It hopes to have its recommendations in force by the summer, when FRS 3
becomes compulsory for companies with year ends after June 22.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Loan notes sale boosts Norex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOREX, the financial services group, made a Pounds 28.7m profit on the sale
of loan notes in Global Marine, the American oil rig company.
This boosted pre-tax profit from Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 28.1m for the six
months to December 31 on turnover of Pounds 4.18m (Pounds 4.67m).
Three years ago Norex America and its partners bought about Dollars 240m
(Pounds 169m) of Global Marine's debt, becoming the main creditors after the
rig builder emerged from Chapter 11.
Norex America, in which the UK group has a 48 per cent stake, took Dollars
134m on to its own books, buying it at a 32 per cent discount to face value.
Global Marine has bought back the outstanding debt at 96 per cent of face
value. Norex America received Dollars 99m gross, of which Dollars 29m was
used to repay bank loans.
In the interim up to Dollars 8m a year has been earned on the difference
between interest received on the loan notes and interest paid on the
associated debt.
Mr Kristian Siem, the Norwegian entrepreneur who is managing director of
Norex and chairman of Norex America, said cash from the sale of a cruise
business had been invested in the Global Marine loan notes.
'It so happened it was easier and cheaper to acquire the debt than to buy
companies directly. The debt was never converted to equity and we are
delighted with the dividends and the profit.'
Norex America would look for further opportunities on the marine side,
concentrating more on the financial angles than on actual operation. 'There
is a role to play when banks are not lending and we are in a capital
intensive business,' Mr Siem said.
Results of Norex, announced yesterday, showed an operating profit of Pounds
855,000 (Pounds 4.84m). Insurance broking was ahead of expectations and
losses were cut in the executive travel agency.
After a minority charge of Pounds 17.7m, attributable profit stood at Pounds
10.4m. Earnings per share were 112.51p (4.95p) and again no interim dividend
is declared.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Harrington Kilbride lifted by acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARRINGTON Kilbride, the specialist publisher, reported profit and turnover
sharply ahead in the year to end-December.
Pre-tax profits advanced 46 per cent to Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 1.27m), on
turnover up 68 per cent to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 9.19m).
The company, floated in December 1991, has been expanding rapidly. It now
has 40 titles, including the Employment Gazette, a government contract won
from HMSO last year. More than half of turnover was generated overseas,
almost all from controlled circulation publications.
Expansion has been largely funded by borrowing. Net debt at the year-end
rose from Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.4m, taking gearing to 65 per cent. However,
falling interest rates cut net interest charges to Pounds 211,000 (Pounds
276,000).
Earnings per share were 11.8p (10.2p). The recommended final dividend is 3p,
making 4.5p for the year.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Carpetright appoints float team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARPETRIGHT of London, Sir Phil Harris's carpet retail chain, has appointed
advisers and non-executive directors ahead of its flotation, planned for the
summer. Details of the float are yet to be finalised but the group is
expected to be valued at between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m.
Carpetright made a pre-tax profit in the year to April 1992 of Pounds 2.8m,
up from Pounds 351,000 the year before. Its interim profits jumped from
Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 3.4m, and analysts are expecting profits for the
current year to top Pounds 7m.
Sir Phil, who headed the Harris Queensway carpet and furniture group until
it was taken over for Pounds 450m in 1988, said that there would be 115
Carpetright stores and another 22 would open in the next year. He said the
chain could expand from cash flow.
MFI Furniture Group holds 22 per cent of the ordinary shares. It has yet to
decide whether to sell them at the time of the float. There are also Pounds
9m worth of preference shares in issue which could be redeemed from the
proceeds of the float.
The non-executives appointed yesterday are Sir Harry Djanogly, a
non-executive director of Coats Viyella and Singer and Friedlander, and Mr
Gerald Dennis, chairman of Alexandra Workwear and Domino Printing Sciences.
Sir Harry chaired Nottingham Manufacturing, the textile group which was
bought by Coats, and Mr Dennis was deputy chairman of BAT Industries.
Sponsors to the float are County NatWest and the brokers are SG Warburg
Securities.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Instem, the USM-quoted computer electronics and information systems group,
saw profits tumble 43 per cent in a 'disappointing outcome' for the 53 weeks
to December 31.
After an exceptional Pounds 386,000 provision for bad debts, after three
customers went into receivership, the pre-tax line emerged at Pounds
575,000, against Pounds 1.01m in the previous year.
Turnover fell 10 per cent to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 15.8m), partly
attributable to the 'uneven nature of our project work' said to Mr David
Gare, chairman.
The final dividend is maintained at 1.8p for a total of 3.1p (3p), covered
2.7 times by earnings of 8.5p (15.2p) per share.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Kalon continues its progress with 15% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALON, the paints group which in August failed to acquire Manders
(Holdings), its rival paints, inks and property company, has continued its
progress with a 15 per cent pre-tax profits rise in the year to December 31.
Under the new FRS 3 accounting rules profits worked through at Pounds 10.6m,
against Pounds 9.22m, after exceptional charges of Pounds 2.62m, of which
Pounds 1.56m was the cost of its abortive bid for Manders and Pounds 1.06m
the loss on the disposal of the chemicals division.
Turnover was Pounds 106.3m (Pounds 98.5m), of which Pounds 3.57m (Pounds
4.48m) related to discontinued operations. Operating profits from continuing
activities rose 38 per cent to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 9.51m) but were knocked
back by losses of Pounds 560,000 (Pounds 330,000) from discontinued
businesses.
Mr Mike Hennessy, group managing director, said Kalon had learnt a lot from
the Manders bid, adding that, without its failing, its other acquisitions
could not all have happened. In December 1992 it bought the J Mangers' DIY
business for Pounds 2.4m, in January the Chelec builders' merchants supply
business for Pounds 250,000, and in February Novodec, the French private
label paint maker, for Pounds 22m.
Within the decorative division, the retail side of the private label paints
business lifted sales 7 per cent in a market which only grew 3 per cent.
Kalon's market share is now estimated at 28 per cent.
On the trade side, overall market sales fell 6 per cent, though sales of
Kalon's Leyland brand rose 14 per cent, in large part on the back of its 68
Leyland trade centres, up five over the year.
Earnings per share slipped to 5.17p (5.28p). A recommended final dividend of
2.2p (1.5p) lifts the total to 3.2p (2.2p).
COMMENT
It is difficult to find fault with Kalon, and though many concede that it
gains much of its drive and clear, coherent strategy from Mr Hennessy, the
feeling is that the businesses are sound and well-managed throughout. Growth
potential abounds. Its efficient factories still have at least 30 per cent
spare capacity and the loss of Manders may be a blessing in disguise. If
Kalon is happy not to threaten the multinationals' grip on the overall
paints market, there are plenty of other opportunities in sundries and in
own-label paints on the Continent and France in particular. Forecast pre-tax
profits for 1993 are about Pounds 19m, with earnings between 9.3p and 9.6p,
giving a multiple of about 15. Reasonable value.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Concern over dividend cuts 10% off Raine
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Raine Industries fell by more than a tenth yesterday
despite the announcement by the UK housebuilder of a 14 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.8m during the six months to end-December.
A rise in group borrowings and concern over an uncovered interim dividend,
which was maintained at 2p, sent Raine's share price tumbling by 12p to
101p, reducing its stock market value by Pounds 22.5m.
Pre-tax profits would have fallen below last year's interim level of Pounds
2.4m if provisions for the six months to end-December 1991 of Pounds 3.4m,
to cover losses on Raine's 2.8 per cent strategic stake in rival
housebuilder YJ Lovell, had not been restated above the line.
The company revealed that since January 1 there had been a substantial
improvement in agreed sales and inquiries from would-be purchasers.
However, Mr Peter Parkin, chairman, said the improvement had come too late
to benefit the current financial year.
He blamed wild fluctuations in currency and interest rates last autumn,
which had hit housebuyers' confidence, and restricted sales during the
run-up to Christmas.
As a result, operating profits had fallen by 11.6 per cent during a first
half which had included the first full six months of sales from Walter
Lawrence.
Earnings, after taking account of the 1991 restated provision, rose from
0.27p to 0.83p.
In order to pay the maintained dividend the company will need to transfer
Pounds 2.19m from reserves.
Borrowings had risen since the end of June by Pounds 17m to Pounds 57m,
equivalent to 47 per cent of shareholders' funds.
Mr Parkin expected borrowings to get back to about Pounds 40m by the end of
June.
He added that the political and economic upheaval caused by sterling's
withdrawal from the ERM had caused tremendous damage to the confidence of
house buyers.
First half sales of 654 were about 180 less than the group had expected.
House prices and margins had remained under severe pressure, particularly in
the south-east.
However, Mr Parkin said that more recently there had been signs that prices
had begun to stabilise, reflecting an increase in demand.
The group's housing operation in California had continued to perform poorly
and incurred a first half loss.
UK contracting was also a difficult market with margins and orders under
severe pressure.
COMMENT
Raine's share price last night was only slightly ahead of the 95p rights
issues price in March last year when it acquired Walter Lawrence. The
company, however, appears willing to raid reserves to maintain the final
dividend provided the housing market does not dive again. It will need
pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 17m in 1993-94 to provide sufficient
earnings to maintain the dividend again. In the current financial year
pre-tax profits are likely to be about Pounds 11m compared with a restated
Pounds 10m for 1991-92. Borrowings, however, will be lower by June. The
group's land costs, one of the lowest in the sector, will stand it in good
stead as the housing market picks up. A prospective p/e approaching 30 for
the current financial year suggests the shares are not going anywhere in the
short term.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Contract-out trend boosts Serco to Pounds
7.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERCO, the facilities and project management company, yesterday announced a
sharp rise in profits and turnover, helped by the growing trend for
government and companies to contract out services.
Pre-tax profits increased 37 per cent from Pounds 5.25m to Pounds 7.21m in
1992. At the interim stage, profits also increased 37 per cent to Pounds
3.39m.
Mr Richard White, managing director, said he was 'extremely pleased' with
the results. 'The whole market remains quite busy,' he said.
Turnover rose 43 per cent to Pounds 149.7m. About half the increase came
from International Aeradio Limited (IAL), the civil aviation specialist
acquired last April from BT for Pounds 12.3m. IAL contributed pre-tax
profits of Pounds 956,000, slightly ahead of expectations.
Operating profits, however, rose only 7.7 per cent to Pounds 5.69m. This was
partly due to costs on restructuring IAL.
Serco holds contracts as varied as the maintenance of Hyde Park, Ministry of
Defence radars and speed cameras in London. Mr White said the company
retained several important contracts after retender.
Associates, which include some Ministry of Defence joint ventures and a New
Zealand company, increased their contribution from Pounds 519,000 to Pounds
1.38m, thanks to contract expansions.
Serco had net interest receivables of Pounds 131,000 compared to charges
last time of Pounds 561,000, mainly because of reduced borrowings after the
Pounds 9.7m rights issue in November 1991.
Fully diluted earnings gained 22.5 per cent to 37p (30.2p). A final dividend
of 9.5p is proposed, to make a total of 14p (11.9p).
COMMENT
Serco is undoubtedly a class act working in a market with guaranteed growth.
But yesterday's 47p rise in the shares to 810p suggests the market may be a
little carried away. To be fair, much of the buying was prompted by analysts
upgrading forecasts for this year by about Pounds 1m to Pounds 9m. The
shares are also closely held so can over react. But after rising more than
40 per cent since September, they are now on more than 17 times and leave
little margin for error. The one question mark is operating profits, where
growth has tended to lag behind increases in turnover. This year, the
figures are obscured by the IAL acquisition. Next time, it should be clearer
whether Serco can make the most of all the new business it is winning.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hays shows modest growth to Pounds 29m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAYS, the business services group, increased pre-tax profits by 9 per cent
to Pounds 29.1m in the six months to December 31.
However, the group said that the early opening of a Milton Keynes
distribution depot for Waitrose in January had brought forward Pounds 1m of
extra costs which would have an effect on the second half's results.
The shares closed 14p lower at 227p.
Mr Ronnie Frost, chairman, said the group had performed well: 'The operating
profits of both the distribution and commercial core activities showed good
growth.'
Group turnover rose from Pounds 341m to Pounds 381.8m and operating income
increased by 8 per cent to Pounds 30.2m.
The distribution division's operating profits rose by 8 per cent to Pounds
17.5m. The group said the performance of Fril, the French distributor bought
for Pounds 37.5m in June, had been up to expectations.
Hays Network Distribution, which encompasses the Dagenham, Network and
Marine businesses, had been substantially reorganised by its new managing
director who was appointed in August. About 20 redundancies, at a cost of
Pounds 250,000, reduced profits. However, Mr Frost said these cuts, and
closure of two offices, would save Pounds 1m a year.
Chemicals distribution's profits declined, mainly because of a surplus of
caustic soda.
The commercial division increased operating profits by 15 per cent to Pounds
10.6m. In spite of the Post Office delaying an increase in the first-class
letter rate, Britdoc's profits continued to grow strongly due to new
business areas and increasing volumes of mail. The group said its parcels
business, Data Express, had done well in a difficult market, increasing both
turnover and profits.
The personnel division's operating profits fell from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds
2.1m, partly because of about Pounds 350,000 of reorganisation costs. All
123 branches, which mainly provide accountancy staff, continued to
contribute to profits.
Earnings per share rose to 4.9p (4.7p). The interim dividend is lifted to
1.7p (1.5p).
COMMENT
Yesterday's figures were at the bottom end of expectations and that was
enough to knock the share price, which has enjoyed a good run from 163p
since September. However, the performance of the main businesses remains
impressive. The commercial division continues to thrive and the dip in
multi-user distribution and the chemicals side shows that recovery would not
just benefit Hays' depressed personnel division. Analysts have brought their
full-year profit forecasts back to about Pounds 67m, which puts the shares
on a prospective multiple of about 20. The 20 per cent premium to the market
does not seem unjustified for a group which will respond speedily to
economic upturn.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Disposals limit Fisons' decline - Continued
withdrawal of products in US behind 24% fall to Pounds 124m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS

<TEXT>
FISONS, the scientific instruments and drugs group, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 down 24 per cent from Pounds
162.6m to Pounds 123.6m. The shares fell 7p to 222p.
The results, which suffered from the continued withdrawal of two
pharmaceuticals products in the US and the impact of the recession on the
scientific instruments division, would have been worse but for a Pounds
23.3m net profit from disposals. Last year there were losses on disposals of
Pounds 24.6m.
Trading profits fell 41 per cent from Pounds 197.4m to Pounds 117.4m, on
turnover up 4 per cent from Pounds 1.24bn to Pounds 1.28bn.
The figures were prepared according to FRS 3. Last year's reported pre-tax
figure was Pounds 190.5m for earnings per share of 20.8p. Earnings per share
fell from 17.4p to 13.9p. The proposed final dividend is maintained at 5.4p
for an unchanged total of 8.7p.
The pharmaceuticals division reported operating profits down 38 per cent
from Pounds 113.6m to Pounds 71m on sales of Pounds 410m (Pounds 427m).
The scientific equipment division's profits were halved at Pounds 35.1m
(Pounds 68.4m) on sales 5 per cent ahead at Pounds 676.2m (Pounds 644.5m).
The horticultural division which is being sold, generated operating profits
of Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 11.5m) on sales of Pounds 107.8m (Pounds 96.7m).
Gearing rose from 38 per cent to 67 per cent, said Mr Roy Thomas, finance
director. Disposals had brought debts down from Pounds 349m to below Pounds
200m by February.
Mr Patrick Egan, group chairman, said the pharmaceuticals division's margins
had been affected by the costs of overhauling manufacturing and quality
control procedures. However, most of this had been completed during the
first six months, and margins during the second half had improved from 11.1
per cent to 21.8 per cent.
Sales of Intal, Fisons' best-selling asthma drug fell 1.2 per cent from
Pounds 192.6m to Pounds 190.3m. This, claimed Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief
executive, was entirely due to trade destocking in the US. He added that
this had been planned and that worldwide prescriptions for Intal had
continued to grow satisfactorily at some 13 per cent.
Tilade, the group's new asthma product which will shortly be launched in the
US, generated revenues up 22 per cent from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 26.1m. The
German market was particularly strong with prescriptions up 22 per cent,
said Mr Scroggs.
He pointed out that the anti-inflammatory treatments Intal and Tilade grew
14 per cent compared with 11 per cent growth for the whole of the asthma
market.
Sales of Opticrom, an eye product, increased 39 per cent from Pounds 31.4m
to Pounds 43.7m thanks to fast growth on the European continent and in
Japan.
Fisons continues to develop its two key new compounds tipredane, an asthma
drug, and remacemide, an epilepsy treatment. Tipredane should be ready for
registration with licensing authorities by 1996, while remacemide should be
ready by 1997.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wm Sinclair down 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM SINCLAIR Holdings, the Lincoln-based supplier to the garden leisure
and pet markets, attributed an 18 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits
to Pounds 1.39m to seasonal changes in its sales profile.
Earnings fell to 4.4p (5.8p) but the interim dividend is maintained at 1.7p.
Turnover of Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 16.3m) included a Pounds 1.5m contribution
from Secto, which was acquired last April.
Mr Tom Sinclair, chairman, said the fall in profits was due to a shift in
sales towards the earlier half of the year, and that turnover and profit
levels would improve for the full financial year.
The company was is looking for acquisitions to strengthen its pet, aquatic
and household division.
Mr Sinclair will resign as chief executive in July, remaining as chairman.
Mr Peter Barton, currently managing director, will succeed as chief
executive.
Analysts are forecasting full-year profits of Pounds 5m, slightly up on last
year's Pounds 4.61m, assuming fair weather conditions.

MERCURY Asset Management has bought 1m shares in Owners Abroad, increasing
its stake to 14.07 per cent in the holiday company that is fighting a
hostile Pounds 268m takeover bid from rival Airtours.
The purchases were reported yesterday and executed at an average price just
below 134p, where Owners share price closed unchanged yesterday. Airtours
closed 1p down at 308p.
Mercury said last night that it had yet to decide whether or not to accept
Airtours' offers.
Mercury is Owners Abroad's largest shareholder and held 13.4 per cent before
the latest purchase. At the same time, Scottish Amicable reported that it
had reduced its stake to 3.7 per cent through the sale of 250,000 shares at
132p.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brabant urges rejection of Aberdeen bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brabant Resources, the oil and gas explorer, yesterday urged shareholders to
reject the all-share bid from Aberdeen Petroleum as its prepares to issue
its defence document early next week.
Mr Nicholas Gay, finance director, asked investors, 'especially small
shareholders, to wait for what we send them'.
The defence document is expected to address several issues raised by
Aberdeen in its final offer submission.
These include Aberdeen's estimate that in the period from its formation in
1986 to December 31 1991 Brabant spent Pounds 14m on exploration.
Brabant is expected to argue that this includes the carrying costs of assets
held as a result of acquisitions. The figure quoted by Brabant is likely to
be closer to Pounds 5m.
The exploration company is also preparing to attack Aberdeen's overhead
costs. Brabant will claim that its overheads, which have averaged 9 per cent
of turnover for the last three years, compares favourably with Aberdeen's 27
per cent average.
Aberdeen is offering 35 shares for every 10 of Brabant's. Aberdeen shares
closed 1p down at 16 1/2 p yesterday, while Brabant's were steady at 42p.
Both companies are quoted on the USM.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BM selling Blackwood Hodge parts to Imaco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM GROUP, the construction equipment and engineering concern, has sold the
UK and Spanish parts of Blackwood Hodge, the international distributor which
it took over in September 1990.
BM's share price plummeted last summer after the sudden departure through
ill health of Mr Roger Shute, its chairman .
Mr Howard Sutton, chief executive, said yesterday the group was seeking to
sell some peripheral or loss-making businesses. He denied rumours that BM
Plant was being sold to its management.
The buyer of Blackwood Hodge UK and Spain, plus two other small
subsidiaries, is International Machinery Company.
Its chief executive is Mr Gordon Brown, one of the three Yorkshire brothers
who built up Brown Group International, which went into receivership in June
1990 with debts of about Pounds 80m.
Mr Brown launched Imaco with the purchase of some of Brown Group's
construction equipment operations from the receiver. Its annual turnover
will be more than doubled by the sales of more than Pounds 20m brought in
through the purchases from BM.
Imaco, based in Wetherby, gained a franchise to sell Terex dump trucks last
year, taking it into competition with Blackwood Hodge UK. It also
distributed Samsung excavators and wheeled loaders.

Traynor, and Mr Ian Clark, of Clark and Co.
Disgruntled trade suppliers said the news of the proposed administration was

exceed Pounds 1.5m.
Mr Hugh Lapham, the former B&amp;Q operations director who was to have become
managing director said yesterday he remained a retail consultant to the
company. He had not become md because a condition on refinancing had not
been met.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: AIB shows IPounds 171.6m thanks to US side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance by First Maryland Bancorp, its US subsidiary, largely
helped Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's largest clearing bank, achieve better
than expected pre-tax profits of IPounds 171.6m (Pounds 177m) for the nine
months ended December 31 1992.
The result was produced despite deteriorating trading conditions in Ireland.
Mr Gerry Scanlan, group chief executive, said: 'Excellent results in the US
and significant improvement in Britain compensated for the lack of growth in
Ireland, which reflected the uncertain market conditions for our customers'.
The group has changed its year-end reporting date from March 31 to December
31 this year consolidating the different reporting dates of the group's
various subsidiaries, making comparison difficult with the 1992 results to
March 31 1992, when pre-tax profits of IPounds 185.8m were reported.
However, due to improved tax management, the post-tax profits of IPounds
107.6m for the nine months compare favourably with IPounds 104.7m for the
previous 12-month period.
Profits growth of 23 per cent was reported at First Maryland which
contributed 43 per cent of total group profits for the nine months period.
Losses in the UK division were down to IPounds 25.6m for the nine months,
compared with IPounds 47m for the previous full year, while the Ireland
division, which includes results from its TSB subsidiary in Northern
Ireland, reported IPounds 129.5m in pre-tax profits for the nine month
period compared with IPounds 172.6m for 1992.
Profits in the Republic, however, were significantly down (by some 20 per
cent on an annualised basis) to IPounds 72.7m from IPounds 121.4m between
the two reporting periods.
Loan loss provisions were IPounds 143.3m for the nine months (IPounds
178.3m) and the the group's Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio has again
improved, from 6.6 per cent to 7.2 per cent.
A final dividend of 4.2p is recommended, giving a total of 8p for the
period. On an annualised basis this equals 8.7p, an increase of 5.5 per cent
over 1991-92.
Market analysts anticipate pre-tax profits in the region of IPounds 220m and
earnings per share of 21p for 1993.
COMMENT
AIB executives remain upbeat about performance in the group's core Irish
market for the year ahead. But the sharp downturn in the last quarter of
1992, triggered by the sterling crisis, high interest rates and a loss of
business confidence, will only be partially offset by the punt's devaluation
at the beginning of this year. Continuing high interest rates, weak
sterling, and ERM instability give little cause for corporate optimism.
Growing loan loss provisions and tighter profit margins would seem a more
likely scenario for 1993. Thus the group's 'engine for growth' appears to
have chugged off to the other side of the Atlantic, where First Maryland has
built up a good head of steam ready to take advantage of the Clinton
economic recovery.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bad debts leave Baltic Pounds 6.5m in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER provisions of Pounds 13.1m for bad debts and property, Baltic, the
leasing group, made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.55m last year, compared with
a profit of Pounds 9.1m in 1991.
The final dividend is cut to 0.5p, making a total of 1p, down from 4.33p.
Mr Michael Goddard, chairman, said a further Pounds 3.3m had been added to
bad debt provisions since the interim stage. Withdrawal from construction
equipment and aircraft financing incurred charges of Pounds 6.2m. A further
Pounds 2m was written off property values.
Operating profit declined by 49 per cent to Pounds 6.02m (Pounds 11.8m) on
turnover of Pounds 35.5m (Pounds 38.5m). More than a quarter of turnover was
accounted for by contract hire, which has been disposed of.
On continuing activities a profit of Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 21.2m) was made
after the Pounds 13.1m provisions. The main items in the leasing portfolio
are forklift trucks, other handling equipment and vehicles, and computers.
Mr Harry Hyman, finance director, warned that there could be further bad
debt provisions this year. The group believed that any fall in the level of
bad debts would lag behind economic recovery.
Attempts to rebuild profitability were constricted by the lack of funding.
'Without gearing an asset finance company will not make an acceptable return
on capital.'
Mr Goddard said business had been badly affected by the poor reputation of
asset finance, leading 'some banks indiscriminately to withdraw financing
across the sector'.
The group's asset finance portfolio had been reduced from Pounds 220m to
Pounds 90m and net debt came down Pounds 75m to Pounds 46m.
Since the year-end the contract hire sale had reduced it further to Pounds
22m.
Interest costs declined from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 11.9m. Mr Hyman said
they would be far lower this year.
Diluted losses per share were 16.9p (earnings 13.3p). Basic losses were 27p
(earnings 14.7p).

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Burnfield doubled to Pounds 2.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURNFIELD, the specialist engineering group, yesterday announced 1992
profits more than doubled to Pounds 2.7m against Pounds 1.2m and a small
acquisition.
Analysts said the figures were in line with expectations.
The results, compiled under new accounting rules, showed that Malvern
Instruments, acquired in mid-1992, contributed Pounds 1.6m to operating
profits which totalled Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.3m).
Group turnover rose from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 29.8m, with Malvern
contributing Pounds 7.5m. The interest charge was Pounds 157,000 (Pounds
146,000). Earnings per share were 6.5p (4.8p) and a final dividend of 4.1p
is proposed to give an unchanged total of 5.75p.
Profits also benefited from a full-year contribution from Budenburg, the
pressure guages and calibration equipment manufacturer acquired in 1991. It
made operating profits of Pounds 2.3m, against Pounds 1.1m in the 7 months
it was owned in 1991.
Sales at Budenburg had fallen by up to 40 per cent for two to three weeks
following Black Wednesday but had now recovered. Analysts said customers had
deferred orders because of lack of confidence in the short term.
Analysts said there were still worries about the continuing contraction in
demand at Isopad, the electric surface heating product manufacturer, which
does about half its business in Germany. Isopad made an operating loss of
Pounds 1.1m compared to a Pounds 183,000 profit in 1991.
Burnfield also announced the acquisition of Desranges et Huot, a French
manufacturer of pressure calibration equipment, for FFr24m (Pounds 3m).
Mr Ben Thefaut, small business analyst at Albert E Sharp, revised upwards
his estimate for this year to Pounds 4.8m, giving earnings per share of
9.1p.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Irish government invites bids for Greencore
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government yesterday threw open the bidding for its 30.4 per cent
stake in Greencore, the recently privatised agribusiness group, following
reported objections from minority coalition partners over proposals to sell
the holding to a US agricultural conglomerate.
In a statement issued yesterday, the government said it had intended to
dispose of the stake through an institutional placing. However, following
approaches from an international foods group - believed to be Illinois-based
Archer Daniels Midland - and several Irish food companies, it decided to
open the bidding until March 24.
Although ADM has categorically denied it is involved in discussions on
buying the stake, speculation now centres on Alfred Topfer, a European
associate of the US company. Yesterday, that company also denied it was
involved.
The decision to put the stake on the open market is reported to have angered
management at Greencore, which has been seeking a partner to help it expand
in Europe.
In a statement released yesterday, Greencore confirmed that it had
introduced a company, believed be a European associate of ADM, to the
government with a view to buying the stake. However, it had not been
informed of approaches from Irish parties.
Observers in Dublin speculated that the Greencore stake had become a
political football, following the controversy over last week's decision by
Digital Equipment, the US computer maker, to close its manufacturing
facility at Galway. 'Games are being played by the minority parties,' said
one observer. 'They cannot be seen to be selling it immediately.'
The government stressed in its statement that any decision on the stake
would be based on price and the 'long-term strategic development of
Greencore as a major Irish food company'. Greencore's own statement,
however, stressed its interest in developing an 'Irish-based international
food group'.
Most analysts dismissed the possibility of an Irish company taking the
stake. The two domestic groups which analysts suggested would have the cash
were Dairygold and Fyffes. Neither would bring any strategic advantages to
Greencore, observers said.
The favourite was still ADM or a company associated with it. Greencore will
have the last say in any substantial sale by the government, as disposals of
15 per cent or more require the approval of shareholders at an extraordinary
meeting.
Greencore announced yesterday that its shares, suspended at 245p in London
on Monday, would resume trading this morning.
Reports of the proposal from the international food group cited an offer of
about 260p per share, valuing the stake at Pounds 66m. The group is believed
to be prepared to go as high as 280p.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: General Accident deficit cut sharply to
Pounds 29.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL ACCIDENT, the Perth-based insurance company, yesterday reported a
fall in pre-tax losses to Pounds 29.3m for 1992, compared with Pounds
171.6m.
Heavy losses from hurricane Andrew prevented the company moving back into
the black, despite better trading conditions and an improvement in most
lines of business.
The company also announced it was raising a further Pounds 110m by the issue
of preference shares. Hoare Govett were lead managers to the issue, which
carries a yield of 10.42 per cent.
Explaining the board's decision not to follow in the footsteps of Commercial
Union by issuing new ordinary share capital, Mr Nelson Robertson, chief
general manager, said: 'We are perfectly happy with our level of solvency.'
The margin, net assets as a percentage of non-life premium income, stands at
46 per cent.
Mr Robertson said GA was gearing for steady rather than rapid growth in
1993, following a 7 per cent increase in premium income last year, in
original currency terms.
Premium income on non-life business grew to Pounds 3.83bn (Pounds 3.22bn),
with life premiums rising to Pounds 790.4m (Pounds 551.9m). The
strengthening of the dollar added Pounds 391m to the total.
Capital was adequate to fuel further growth, added Mr Robertson. 'I don't
think we will be under any pressure at this point in the cycle.'
Despite a net loss of Pounds 65m from hurricane Andrew, which caused
extensive damage in Florida and Louisiana in August, underwriting losses
fell to Pounds 510.1m (Pounds 569.1m). Other storm losses amounted to Pounds
47m.
Investment income rose to Pounds 504.9m (Pounds 448.8m). The estate agency
side reported losses of Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 17.8m). Life profits were
Pounds 34.8m (Pounds 27m).
Loan interest amounted to Pounds 40.1m (Pounds 59.7m).
Losses emerged at 7p (32.1p). A final dividend of 17.05p makes a same-again
26.75p total, which is uncovered for a third successive year.
The improvement at General Accident has been most marked in the UK, where
rises in premium rates fed through into a reduction of underwriting losses
to Pounds 175.2m (Pounds 341.9m).
Increases in motor rates and a sharp reduction in exposures, helped cut the
loss in motor business to Pounds 68.5m (Pounds 113.9m), although Mr
Robertson acknowledged that the improvement was weaker than that reported by
some of the company's competitors.
Price increases of more than 20 per cent helped the homeowners' account
turnround from losses of Pounds 37.9m to a profit of Pounds 9.3m. All other
lines showed improvment.
However, in the US underwriting losses climbed to Dollars 323.7m (Pounds
228m), against Dollars 214.7m, reflecting both the storm losses and a
decision to increase reserves on commercial liability following the
notification of more potential environmental claims.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Vivat advances to Pounds 3m as recovery
gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIVAT HOLDINGS, the Lee Cooper clothing group, announced pre-tax profits of
Pounds 3m for the 1992 year, recovering from a year-earlier loss of Pounds
678,000.
It is proposing to resume dividends with a 1p final out of earnings per
share of 3.9p (losses 1.2p)
A fall in turnover to Pounds 73.4m (Pounds 89.1m) reflected the closure of
loss-making activities. Gearing was cut to 51 per cent (73 per cent).
Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said: '1992 was a year of consolidation
during which we focused on our core Lee Cooper business and brand.'
By focusing on its Lee Cooper brand, Vivat expects to extend its recovery
this year. The shares closed up 12p on the day at 45p.
The company made an extraordinary provision of Pounds 541,000 on top of
Pounds 4m provided a year earlier against its liability for about 40 retail
property leases it had sold in 1988. It regained responsibility for the
leases when the purchaser, Chelsea Man, went into administrative
receivership.
The company has not yet adopted new accounting rules which restrict the use
of extraordinary items but believes its leasehold liabilities would still
qualify as extraordinary next year when the new standard is compulsory.

FT  03 MAR 93 / British Gas uses Eurobonds to raise Pounds 400m at less than
8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas raised Pounds 400m in the international bond market yesterday,
joining the growing number of UK companies seeking to secure long-term
borrowings at the lowest interest rates since the 1970s.
The strength of demand for longer-dated sterling bonds enabled British Gas
to fulfil a large part of its 1993 borrowing programme of Pounds 500m in one
move. The utility launched two Eurobond issues, each of Pounds 200m, one
with a maturity of seven years and the other with 10 years. The average
fixed interest rate paid by British Gas is less than 8 per cent.
Mr Arthur Burgess, British Gas's group treasurer, said: 'If someone had told
us two or three years ago that we would be able to accomplish this, we would
not have believed it.'
Other recent corporate borrowers have been Argyll, the supermarket group,
which raised Pounds 150m through a seven-year Eurobond issue, and Peugeot
Talbot Motor Company, the UK subsidiary of the French car group, which
tapped the market for Pounds 100m through a Eurobond issue with a maturity
of just under five years.
Mr Burgess acknowledged that long-term interest rates may fall further
still, but added that there might be some wait before base rates were cut
again. 'It seemed sensible to us to borrow now,' he said.
The proceeds from yesterday's issues will be used for general corporate
funding. British Gas has heavy investments in capital projects, and plans to
spend up to Pounds 2bn this year on capital expenditure.
A scarcity of longer-dated corporate bonds has reduced the premium that
companies have to pay over the yield on UK government bonds, resulting in
cheaper borrowing costs to the issuer.
Last week, Royal Insurance raised Pounds 100m worth of subordinated
Eurobonds due 2003. Mr Roy Randall, head of group corporate relations at
Royal Insurance, said the beneficial interest rates meant a big saving in
the group's borrowing costs.
Also last week, Woolwich Building Society raised a similar amount of
subordinated sterling Eurobonds, but with a much longer maturity of 24 3/4
years. At the end of January, the Royal Bank of Scotland launched Pounds
150m of 20-year Eurobonds.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Property deals bolstered Maxwell profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATORS unravelling the affairs of Maxwell Communication Corporation
have discovered a series of complex property deals involving Liechtenstein
trust companies which were used by the late Mr Robert Maxwell to bolster
profits at the insolvent publishing company.
This shows for the first time that Mr Maxwell was under severe financial
pressure as early as 1990. He apparently resorted to bogus foreign exchange
transactions and inflated property deals to generate substantial paper
profits for MCC.
Previously it was thought that the pressure built up in 1991, forcing him to
raid company pension funds in the months before his death in November 1991
after which his business empire collapsed.
Investigators from the litigation and special investigation services unit at
Price Waterhouse, administrators to MCC, have discovered transactions in
which MCC sold property assets to a Liechtenstein trust company shortly
before the end of a financial reporting period, and then posted a profit on
the disposals, even though full payment was deferred. In a typical
transaction the Liechtenstein trust would subsequently transfer the property
to one of Mr Maxwell's private companies, which then used the assets as
security for new loans. On the basis of three transactions the investigators
believe MCC is still owed at least Pounds 62.5m.
The administrators have also submitted substantial insurance claims under
policies taken out by MCC. The biggest claims, 18 in total, have been made
under the group's 'Fidelity Policy' which provides an indemnity up to Pounds
50m for any one loss, subject to a limit of Pounds 50m per employee in the
1991 policy year. The underwriters are disputing all the claims.
Overall, the administrators estimate that after administration costs of
Pounds 43.2m, but excluding up to Dollars 300m (Pounds 211m) of further
claims, they will recover between Dollars 781m and Dollars 1.364bn. This
would provide creditors with between 22 per cent and 43 per cent of the more
than Dollars 3bn they are owed. If all recovery actions were successful the
payout could be lifted by up to a further 9 percentage points.
Mr Mark Homan, senior joint administrator, said yesterday the main area
where investigators may uncover further allegedly false transactions is in
MCC's foreign exchange dealings.

FT  03 MAR 93 / RJR creates 'smoke-free' stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR NABISCO, the US group which was subject to a record Dollars 25bn (Pounds
17.6bn) leveraged buy-out in 1989, is to create a separate class of shares
tied directly to the fortunes of its worldwide food operations, technically
making them a 'smoke-free' zone.
The move will allow investors to hold shares unconnected with RJR's tobacco
interests. Tobacco shares have been hurt by discount brands and fears that
the US will impose higher taxes and tougher rules on smoking at work. Some
institutions are barred from holding them by 'ethical considerations'.
RJR's aim is to raise about Dollars 1.5bn, helping to pay off group debt
which financial restructurings have already cut from Dollars 30bn at the
time of the buy-out to about Dollars 14bn. The shares, to be called
RN-Nabisco Group stock, will initially be sold to new investors. The company
plans an offering of 93m Nabisco shares, representing 25 per cent of the
food group's equity, at a price of Dollars 17-Dollars 19 a share.
About six months later, the company will issue further Nabisco shares,
representing a 47 per cent equity interest in the food group, to existing
RJR Nabisco shareholders.
Existing RJR Nabisco ordinary shares will be redesignated as RN-Reynolds
stock, and will represent a 100 per cent interest in the tobacco operations
and a 28 per cent interest in the food business. RJR will also start paying
dividends, on both classes of stock.
Someone owning 100 RJR Nabisco shares today would ultimately end up with
12.5 RN-Nabisco shares and 33.3 RN-Reynolds shares. The annual dividend on
each RN-Nabisco share would be 52 cents; on each RN-Reynolds share, it would
be Dollars 1 in respect of the tobacco interests plus a further
'pass-through' dividend to reflect the retained 28 per cent interest in the
food business's equity.
This is not a full demerger of the food operations, which had sales of
Dollars 6.7bn last year and operating profits of Dollars 947m, and RJR
Nabisco stressed there would be no transfer of legal title to assets.
Mr Lou Gerstner, RJR's chairman, said the move was designed to 'enhance the
value of the company for shareholders and attract new shareholders by
underscoring the distinct growth characteristics of the food industry and
cashflow characteristics'.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Abbey National falls 9% to Pounds 564m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National, the banking group, yesterday disclosed a 9 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 564m for 1992, compared with Pounds 618m in the
previous year. Provisions for bad and doubtful loans more than doubled to
Pounds 322m from Pounds 155m.
The company, which complied with the financial reporting standard FRS 3,
declared an exceptional loss of Pounds 138m for its estate agency business
and an exceptional profit of Pounds 101m on the sale of 29m shares unclaimed
from its 1989 flotation.
Sir Christopher Tugendhat, chairman, announced that its estate agency chain
was being offered for sale following a Pounds 126m write-down of goodwill
taken through the profit and loss account, and a further Pounds 12m
restructuring charge.
Sir Christopher said there were grounds for 'cautious optimism' for this
year because the low point in the housing cycle appeared to have passed.
Pent-up demand in the market would combine with increased life insurance
sales.
Abbey's treasury operations reported a 61 per cent increase in profits to
Pounds 100m. Its treasury assets rose 49 per cent to Pounds 23.8bn because
of rises in sterling and dollar portfolios, and its finance leasing book.
The company announced a provision of Pounds 47m (up from Pounds 12m) for its
lending in continental Europe. European operations including operations in
France and Spain incurred a total loss of Pounds 50m (up from Pounds 1m) and
business in both countries have been restructured.
Pre-tax profits in UK retail operations fell 8 per cent to Pounds 540m. The
fall in base rates in the last quarter helped it to widen the margin between
lending and funding rates from 1.91 per cent to 2.28 per cent. Provisions
for UK retail operations rose to Pounds 275m from Pounds 142m.
Abbey's post-tax earnings fell 23 per cent to Pounds 317m, producing
earnings per share of 24.2p (against 31.6p). The 'abnormally high' effective
tax rate of 44 per cent (against 33 per cent) was partly caused by its
goodwill write-down. The company proposed a final dividend of 7.7p, giving a
9.5 increase in the total dividend from 10.5p to 11.5p, which was covered
2.1 times. Shares closed down 12p at 385p.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Ballot box crusaders ride to foreign wars: The rise of
global activism among US institutional shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corporate under-performers of the world beware - the Americans are coming.
US institutional investors, having stirred up corporate America over the
past five years with demands for better-run businesses and more accountable
managements, are beginning to flex their muscles in the other leading
western economies.
After years of passive investment abroad, they are starting to vote their
shares (known in the US as 'proxies') at foreign companies' annual meetings
 -sometimes casting them against the incumbent management.
Foremost foreign crusader is the California Public Employees Retirement
System, the largest public pension fund in the US and one of the most
forceful leaders of the domestic corporate governance movement.
In December it sent shock waves through German boardrooms when it backed a
proposal by a German shareholder association to the annual meeting of RWE,
the energy conglomerate. This called for one-share, one-vote in place of the
RWE system that gave a majority of votes to a minority of shareholders.
A Calpers representative delivered a speech declaring that it was naive for
German companies to maintain voting restrictions and still expect to retain
access to international capital markets.
In France two months earlier, Calpers had led an unsuccessful protest
against food giant BSN's move to limit the voting rights of large investors.
Confrontations such as this are still unusual, but look like becoming
increasingly common. A survey of US institutions released last month by the
Investor Responsibility Research Centre, a non-profit-making Washington
information service, found some larger ones 'gearing up to take shareholder
activism worldwide in 1993'.
Whether they will get results is another matter, although Mr Geoffrey
Mazullo, of Washington-based Institutional Shareholder Services, which
advises US investors on proxy voting, points out that the RWE protest is
already having a knock-on effect. A German shareholder activist has tabled a
resolution for the annual meeting of electronics giant Siemens on March 11,
which calls for the abolition of special voting rights for the Siemens
family and specifically mentions Calpers' RWE stand.
A substantial number of experts believe a shortage of global capital,
combined with the sheer size of the potential US investment pool, will make
foreign companies particularly sensitive to US institutional views. The
result could be to move the disparate corporate governance practices of
continental Europe and Japan much closer to the Anglo-Saxon models of the US
and UK.
Why are US institutions sallying abroad now? The main reason is that US
equity investment overseas is growing rapidly. 'With more than Dollars 250bn
(Pounds 176bn) of international stocks at stake, US shareholders are saying
they can't afford to ignore the hazards of different corporate governance
practice abroad,' says IRRC's Mr Stephen Davis.
US Department of Labor guidelines also place a fiduciary obligation on the
part of many institutions to vote their proxies, although it remains unclear
to what extent this covers foreign as well as US shareholdings.
However, until recently it was difficult for US shareholders to vote in many
foreign countries, even if they wanted to, because it was hard to get
information about proxy issues in good time or to vote without running up
costs, which made the exercise of dubious financial value.
But over the past few years global custodian banks, whose local affiliates
are the holders of records for clients' shares, have been putting much
greater effort into obtaining voting material, translating it into English
and then taking responsibility for executing votes.
For example, TIAA-CREF, the largest US pension fund, made a special drive
last year to vote in Japan, even though local companies make proxy materials
available only in Japanese and send them out just two weeks before the one
day in June when a huge number of Japanese annual meetings are held
simultaneously. Helped by its custodians, Bankers Trust and Bank of Tokyo,
the fund managed to get its hands on 250 proxies and vote them.
However, the IRRC study points out that many local custodians in Germany,
the Netherlands and Japan refuse to cast votes against management, even if
instructed to do so by the stock-owner or global custodian, because they
maintain close ties to the company. Institutions that find this a problem
are likely to contract with one of the emerging global proxy voting
services.
ISS, which has long advised US institutions about domestic proxy issues, set
up a global corporate governance service a year ago which provides voting
guidelines on more than 2,000 shareholder meetings around the globe and can
co-ordinate the execution of votes with custodians.
At ISS's annual proxy conference, held in Washington last week, a whole
workshop was devoted to global voting and the issues likely to be most
important in each country this year.
Increasing US interest was underlined by the IRRC survey, which showed
institutions voting 40 per cent of their non-US stock in 1992, up from 24
per cent the previous year.
However, voting stock does not necessarily mean opposing management - and
most US investors who bother to cast ballots abroad support boardroom
positions most of the time.
Where they have taken issue is on certain specific questions, such as
restrictions on shareholder voting rights in Germany and introduction of
anti-takeover devices in France.
These are the kind of basic issues on which the corporate governance
movement cut its teeth in the US in the late 1980s. However, in its home
territory the movement has now moved on to analysing individual companies'
financial performance and pressing for management change when this is
wanting.
Mr Mazullo of ISS thinks US investors will eventually take a similar
approach to foreign stocks, although not for some time. In many countries,
he says, 'We're still trying to get very basic types of disclosure, and
without that information you can't make those calculations.'

FT  03 MAR 93 / Abbey National aims to set up insurance subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHAKE-UP in the housing insurance market was predicted yesterday after
Abbey National, one of the biggest mortgage lenders, rejected insurance
companies' attempts to set higher premiums to compensate for more than
Pounds 2bn of losses.
Abbey said it was trying to establish an insurance subsidiary to provide its
own mortgage indemnity insurance.
It emerged separately that at least 11 large mortgage lenders are
considering breaking with general insurers.
Home buyers now face substantially higher premiums to pay for mortgage
indemnity policies, which cover lenders against a portion of losses on sales
of repossessed properties.
But Abbey's move could lead to competition between lenders and insurers to
provide buildings and contents insurance, as lenders may use new
subsidiaries to underwrite household insurance.
Mr Dane Douetil, a specialist in mortgage indemnity business with brokers
Special Risk Services, said his group was negotiating with 11 of the
country's largest lenders about similar self-insurance schemes.
Although building societies are currently barred from owning more than 15
per cent of a general insurance company, societies are pressing the Building
Societies Commission to relax this rule.
Mr Michael Coogan, deputy secretary of the Building Societies Association,
said several large lenders had been examining the possibility of
establishing their own 'captive' insurers.
Two centralised mortgage lenders - Household Mortgage Corporation and The
Mortgage Corporation - have already set up their own subsidiaries to insure
indemnity risks.
Abbey said the terms it was offered by Legal &amp; General, Royal Insurance and
Commercial Union were not acceptable. Mr Peter Birch, Abbey chief executive,
said the company was negotiating with re-insurers. He said it had no cover
for new mortgages at the moment, but would achieve new cover by mid-year.
Talks between insurers and lenders have been underway for over a year. In
September, insurers established new standard contracts limiting their
liability to the section of loans above 75 or 80 per cent of the value of
properties. Any losses within this limit will be split between insurers and
lenders, with insurers bearing 80 per cent of the loss. Insurers have also
restricted the types of properties on which they will insure mortgages.
The insurers made estimated losses of Pounds 1.38bn on mortgage indemnity
policies in 1991, and more than Pounds 800m last year.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Setback for Italian reform plans: Head of inquiry into
constitutional changes quits after brother's arrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CORRUPTION scandal that is ravaging Italian politics and business
claimed another victim yesterday when the head of the parliamentary
commission for constitutional reform resigned.
The decision by Mr Ciriaco de Mita, a former Christian Democrat prime
minister, followed the arrest on Monday of his brother on charges of alleged
corruption.
Leaders of the main political parties asked him to reconsider the decision,
which threatened to disrupt the work of the constitutional reform commission
at a crucial moment.
The commission has just completed draft proposals for electoral reform which
need to be translated into law before a referendum on the subject can be
held on April 18.
Mr de Mita's resignation came as parliament began the delicate process of
considering whether to waive parliamentary immunity for Mr Bettino Craxi,
the former Socialist leader.
Milan magistrates have asked for immunity to be waived so that Mr Craxi can
answer charges of alleged corruption and illicit financing of the Socialist
party amounting to L36bn (Pounds 16m). A decision is expected today.
In parliament yesterday, deputies were provided with a 135-page document in
which Mr Craxi argued that his immunity should not be waived to face
corruption charges.
The former Socialist leader claimed that Milan magistrates had mounted an
elaborate plot to discredit him and that he as party leader was not involved
in the financial administration of the Socialists.
In a letter to the commission, Mr de Mita said he was resigning to prevent
speculation that his brother's arrest might upset the task of constitutional
reform.
His brother, Michele, was arrested with 11 others as part of a wide-ranging
investigation into the use of funds for the relief of the 1980 earthquake at
Irpinia in southern Italy. He is alleged to have been part of an
organisation which supplied false invoices for the supply of foodstuffs.
Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader, warned that Mr de
Mita's resignation would undermine the work of the commission and urged him
to reconsider. The opposition former communists in the Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS) also backed this view. The populist Lombard League was
one of the few groups to accept the resignation.
The 60-member commission was formed from the two houses of parliament last
autumn, and has become the central forum for preparing constitutional
reform. With an April 18 date now fixed for the referendum calling for the
introduction of majority voting to elect members of the senate, it is
essential for the commission to have coherent leadership. The commission has
to frame concrete legislation on electoral reform either before or
immediately after the referendum.
Mr Giovanni Conso, the justice minister, meanwhile has said he hopes to be
able to have ready by the end of this week draft legislation to provide a
'political' solution to the widening corruption scandals.
The proposals are expected to centre on new laws for tenders and financing
of political parties, combined with amnesties for those who confess to
paying and receiving bribes in return for restitution of the monies.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Computer to 'speak' Europe's language
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'SPEAKING' computer that can read the most difficult European words and
pronounce them to the satisfaction of the most punctilious local should
emerge within the next two years.
The European pronunciation dictionary, which will decide how to say the most
commonly used surnames, street names and town and city names in eight
European countries, is being funded by the European Commission to the tune
of Pounds 2m.
The two-year Onomastica project is intended to do more than alleviate the
frustration of people with names such as Mainwaring or St John in places
such as Cholmondeley, all of which are not pronounced according to English
phonetic rules.
Its aim is to produce pronunciation dictionaries for the UK, Denmark, the
Netherlands, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, giving the
1m most commonly used names for each.
'We're filling in the gap in the dictionary,' says Professor Mervyn Jack of
the Centre for Speech Technology Research at Edinburgh University, which is
co-ordinating the project.
Researchers believe the completed electronic dictionary could be used in
conjunction with existing text-to-speech technology to enable recorded
announcements to be read from computer screen or paper.
Eventually it could be combined with speech recognition technology to
automate entirely telephone directory inquiry services.
Converting the names into spoken form has two stages: the written text is
divided into individual sound elements, which are then converted into an
audible synthetic voice.
Although the text-to-speech conversion uses the latest technology, gathering
the data is laborious. The institutions involved will each begin with a list
of the 1m most commonly used names.
In the UK, individuals, including primary school children, will be asked to
pronounce their names into a tape recorder. A telephone line is also being
set up for those with unusual names to phone up and enunciate them.
This should take 18 months, after which each country will exchange
information on the most commonly used of the 8m words.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Employers use surpluses to take holiday from pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of all British employers are now using pension fund surpluses
to reduce or eliminate their contributions to employee pension schemes,
according to an industry survey.
The National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association,
found in its 1992 survey of pension schemes that 38 per cent of employers
are making no contribution while another 16 per cent are making reduced
contributions. A further 1 per cent have used scheme surpluses to refund
cash to themselves.
The figures show a rise from the previous survey in 1991, which found that
47 per cent of schemes were on full or partial contributions holiday.
Mr Mike Brown, NAPF director of information, said the rise in contributions
holidays showed the effects that the recession was having on employers.
'They would rather use the money to pay their suppliers and staff,' he said.
The question of whether employers should have the exclusive right to use
scheme surpluses is among the most contentious issues under review by a
government panel headed by Professor Roy Goode. The NAPF survey did not ask
respondents whether contributions holidays have been accompanied by benefit
improvements for scheme members.
The survey covered 852 NAPF members, covering roughly 40 per cent of all UK
pension scheme members.
Meanwhile, the survey noted one potentially troubling trend for occupational
pension schemes. Last year, 19 per cent of those eligible to join a scheme
chose not to do so, up from 16 per cent the year before. Mr Brown said there
may have been reasons other than disenchantment with occupational schemes
which might account for the figure, such as the inclusion of part-time
workers who may feel their earnings are too low to be able to afford
contributions.
Meanwhile, the survey found no sign of a much touted trend suggesting that
employers are abandoning so-called final salary schemes - which promise
employees a percentage of final salary upon retirement - in favor of money
purchase schemes in which the employee receives a lump sum of contributions
plus investment returns.
Mr Brown said: 'It's the sort of thing many people are talking about but
very few are actually doing it.' Employers have threatened that, if the
government imposes new regulations on occupational pension schemes, they
will abandon them in favour of the less attractive money-purchase schemes.
The survey also found that, after the Maxwell affair, companies are more
likely to appoint non-management trustees to their pension schemes.

It is always difficult to make much sense of the UK reserves data. Still, a
small underlying fall for the second month in a row suggests that exchange
market intervention last September may have been smaller than originally
thought. Either that or the Bank has bought back some currency in the market
since then. Whatever the case, the upshot is that the contribution to this
quarter's PSBR funding from intervention must be scaled back. But since the
deficit may well be less than the Pounds 37bn forecast in the Autumn
Statement, the authorities still have a chance of starting 1993-94 with some
funding in the bag.

FT  03 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: PolyGram
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Comparisons of stock market values often highlight anomalies. That between
the PolyGram music business and its 80 per cent shareholder, Philips, looks
decidedly bizarre. Last year, PolyGram's market value overtook Philips' on
the Dutch stock exchange. At its current value of Fl 7.9bn, PolyGram is
worth 1.2 times more than its parent company. Philips' stake in PolyGram is
equivalent to some 96 per cent of its own stock market worth. That suggests
the market values the rest of the Fl 57bn turnover company at just Fl 250m.
Great as Philips' problems are, that seems to be extreme.
The obvious conclusion is that Philips should realise considerable
shareholder value by fully demerging PolyGram as Racal did with Vodafone. It
has long resisted the urge. But the pressure to do so may grow as the
divergence in performance between the two companies seems set to widen.
Yesterday, PolyGram recorded a 13 per cent increase in net income. With its
sound balance sheet and strong market positions, it confidently predicted
further growth. Tomorrow, Philips is expected to unveil dire annual results.
Its recovery potential looks limited.

FT  03 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: General Accident
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So the gauntlet of Commercial Union's rights issue has not been taken up by
General Accident. Sterling's exit from the ERM must take some credit. With a
substantial portion of shareholders funds parked in dollar assets, a
devalued sterling has been a prop for GA's balance sheet. Rising stock and
bond markets have equally offered timely capital gains. That, and some
judicious use of preference capital, has produced a comfortable solvency
ratio of 46 per cent without recourse to shareholders.
But yesterday's Pounds 110m preference issue does not plug the hole in the
balance sheet created by another uncut, uncovered dividend. Although GA
could raise more preference capital this year, that can only be taken so
far. Since further currency and investment gains cannot be taken for
granted, premium growth will ultimately require backing from retained
earnings or a rights issue. Yesterday's figures reveal GA's ambition: UK
premiums grew at an annual rate of 25 per cent in the fourth quarter, albeit
boosted by a block of business taken from Municipal &amp; Mutual.
With Pounds 1.2bn annual premium income in the UK and its chain of 400
estate agencies, GA looks geared to an upturn. Given another respectable
result in Asia and a fair wind in the US - literally, given the damage
caused by Hurricane Andrew - the 1993 dividend could be covered for the
first time in four years. But there is little margin for error.

FT  03 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons describes 1992 as a year of change. A shock collision with reality
might be more accurate. The company may be trying to ditch its reputation
for nasty surprises and inculcate a less complacent management attitude, but
it cannot seem to shake off lingering uncertainties. It is not yet clear
that the production difficulties which slowed sales and upset the US Food
and Drug Administration have finally been solved. Fisons Opticrom treatment
has still not been re-admitted to the US. Its cash cow, Intal, may face
competition once its US patent expires in August. The prospects for its new
drug Tilade are still muddy. Despite the fall in sterling, the company may
have difficulty restoring margins on its scientific equipment business in a
weak European market.
Small wonder, then, that no one has summoned up the nerve to bid for the
company. Nor are they likely to, since Fisons has neither a gold mine of new
compounds nor a steam roller sales force. Even the recovery potential seems
pretty well discounted with a prospective 1993 rating which puts Fisons
alongside Glaxo. To be fair, a 5.1 per cent yield does offer underpinning.
The company is, however, likely to remain a niche player in pharmaceuticals.
The delay caused by past management arrogance and shoddy production values
seems to have closed the door on greater things indefinitely.

FT  03 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Abbey's bad habit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Abbey National's Pounds 101m windfall from last year's share sale is a curse
as well as a blessing. It has provided elegant camouflage for the cost of
getting out of estate agency. Net exceptional debits for last year amount to
only Pounds 37m, but the gross charge for restructuring the estate agency
business was Pounds 138m. Factor in accumulated losses since 1988 and the
total cost of this particular venture becomes Pounds 226m. That adds up to a
gross strategic blunder which, sadly, Abbey now risks compounding. The
timing of its windfall has encouraged it to put the agencies up for sale at
what must be about the bottom of the market.
This is a poor advertisement for Abbey's strategic sense, especially since
it coincides with growing loss provisions in Europe. Abbey has a deservedly
high reputation as a mortgage bank. But, with the exception of the treasury
business whose expansion has about run its course, its attempts to diversify
have disappointed.
Perhaps insurance will prove otherwise. One must hope so since the mortgage
business seems set for a lean 1993. The Pounds 62m general provision will
help smooth the effect of the abnormally high net retail margin which Abbey
enjoyed as interest rates came down in the second half of 1992. This year,
provisions are likely to remain high while the net retail margin will be
squeezed. Supporters will argue that the bank has plenty of scope for
dividend growth. That is an old story, though, and already in the price.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Bumpy flight from conflict to concord: Acrimony could give
way to co-operation in the international aerospace industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The European Airbus consortium could not have chosen a worse moment to bring
to market a new airliner.
The launch in Hamburg today of the A321 - a larger 186-seat derivative of
the A320 twin-engine airliner - comes in the middle of the worst recession
to hit civil aviation in the past 40 years.
Aircraft manufacturers around the world have been scrambling to cut
production and employment to adapt to the siege-like conditions facing the
industry. Airlines, which have made a cumulative loss of more more than
Dollars 10bn during the past three years, have continued to defer or cancel
an unprecedented number of new aircraft orders booked during the buying
spree of the late 1980s.
The crisis, different from previous cyclical downturns because it has
coincided with a deep slump in the defence side of the aerospace business,
has also revived trade tensions between the US and Europe over the
controversial issue of government subsidies for Airbus.
President Bill Clinton warned last week that he was determined to do
'whatever it takes' to maintain US leadership in the commercial aircraft
business. The US reached an agreement with the European Commission last year
on commercial aircraft subsidies after five years of heated negotiations.
But accusations are again flying across the Atlantic that Airbus is selling
aircraft to financially troubled US airlines at unfair prices to increase
its market penetration at the expense of its two US rivals, Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas.
President Clinton told an audience of US aerospace executives and Boeing
workers in Seattle: 'I've seen these agreements made for years: I've seen
people promise us they'd do this, that and the other thing, and nothing ever
happens.' Mr Larry Clarkson, Boeing's vice-president for planning and
international development, followed this by telling a congressional aviation
committee last week that it was 'critical that the Europeans understand that
neither the US government nor its aircraft industry will stand on the
sidelines and allow these practices to rob us of our market'.
However, at this stage at least, Mr Clinton's broadside against Airbus
appears to have been largely dictated by domestic US concerns at a time when
thousands of jobs are at risk in the aerospace industry.
Both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are in the throes of sweeping
restructuring. Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets
with about 60 per cent of the world market, is reducing its overall
production by 35 per cent and has announced 28,000 job cuts over the next 18
months. McDonnell Douglas, now trailing behind Airbus as the world's number
three commercial aircraft maker, plans to reduce its workforce by 10 per
cent this year after cutting it by 20 per cent last year. By the end of this
year, the group's overall employment will have dropped from 121,000 in 1990
to about 78,000.
Mr Clinton told Boeing workers that 'a lot of these lay-offs would not have
been announced had it not been for the Dollars 26bn that the US sat by and
let Europe plough into Airbus over the last seven years'.
Airbus has also been forced to revise production plans. But, unlike its two
American competitors which are reducing output, Airbus has so far claimed
its output will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate. Mr Jean Pierson,
the Airbus managing director, said last month that the consortium's
production was expected to grow from about 150 aircraft this year to about
170 in 1995, compared with an original target of 225 in 1995.
This has led to US fears that Airbus will seek to intensify its drive to win
greater market share by offering sweetheart financing packages and pricing
terms that breach last year's US-EC pact on civil aircraft sales.
'We expect that these types of creative mechanisms will proliferate,' said
Boeing's Mr Clarkson.
Airbus and its four partner companies - Aerospatiale of France, British
Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace, and Casa of Spain - have consistently argued
that US manufacturers have benefited at least as much from direct and
indirect support from their government. They also claim that US
manufacturers, like Airbus, have long supplied financing to airline
customers to win large orders.
But for all the transatlantic sabre-rattling of the past few weeks, neither
the manufacturers nor their respective governments appear anxious to
precipitate a trade war over civil aircraft sales. 'No one is about to
launch a major new aircraft programme in this market and we are therefore
not worried about development subsidies,' Mr Clarkson explained. 'What we
want is for the agreement reached last year to be implemented so that we can
finally get some visibility on the true financial situation of Airbus,' he
added.
To this end, the US administration has now asked for consultations with the
EC to review and implement last year's agreement. President Clinton has also
decided to establish a national commission to investigate the conditions and
problems of the financially strapped US airline industry.
The proposal for a commission has been welcomed by the US manufacturers,
which believe their most pressing problem is airline finances rather than
Airbus subsidies. 'Let's face it, the Europeans are simply not going to give
up on Airbus, but the government could help airlines around the world with
financing support to buy our products,' said Mr John McDonnell, chairman of
McDonnell Douglas. He was speaking last month at the roll-out of his
company's new twin-engine jet, the MD90, a new derivative of McDonnell
Douglas's long-established DC9 and MD80 family of narrowbody jets which
competes with the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737.
Of the big three manufacturers, McDonnell Douglas is regarded as the most
vulnerable. Many analysts believe the company could follow Lockheed and
decide to pull out of the commercial aircraft business to concentrate
exclusively on its defence operations. But Mr McDonnell and his senior
executives insist that the company is not about to abandon its civil
aircraft activities, which are based at Long Beach, California.
McDonnell's strategy has been to drive down costs aggressively and reduce
production. The chairman said the company had refused to go after 'bad
business' simply to land orders and buy market share.
But he acknowledged that his company suffers a severe disadvantage because
it does not have as broad a product line as either Boeing or Airbus. 'Right
now, this is not such a big handicap because no airlines are buying
aircraft: but it will be important for us not to have this disadvantage when
the cycle picks up again in two or three years' time,' he explained.
For McDonnell Douglas the solution lies in a global partnership which would
create a new commercial aircraft company, controlled by the US group but
with a series of international equity partners prepared to invest in the
development of new products. Although Mr McDonnell failed to clinch a
partnership last year with Taiwan Aerospace, which was proposing to invest
Dollars 2bn for a 49 per cent stake in the Douglas civil aircraft business,
he said the company was now engaged in 'mature discussions' with a number of
potential partners, including several in the Asia-Pacific region.
He explained: 'We've got two years to establish this new entity with
multiple owners which would help broaden our product line.' But the
implication is that unless McDonnell Douglas can find international
partners, its longer-term future as a manufacturer of commercial jets will
be in doubt.
This quest for partners, which would enable the Long Beach company to
establish a similar risk-sharing system operated by Boeing with the three
Japanese manufacturers (Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries) and by the four European manufacturers
through the Airbus consortium, also explains why the US manufacturers are
reluctant to engage in a trade war against Airbus.
Boeing, too, is currently seeking to expand its international links.
Significantly, it agreed at the end of January to study with the four Airbus
partners the joint development of a super jumbo jet capable of seating
600-800 passengers. 'No single manufacturer could envisage developing such
an aircraft on his own,' Mr Clarkson said.
From Seattle to Long Beach to Toulouse, therefore, new realignments are
starting to emerge which could lead to a profound transformation in the
structure of the commercial aircraft industry over the next decade. 'Like
the birth of an airplane, the birth of new enterprises has been an important
part of the process of renewal within our industry for many years,' Mr
McDonnell said. 'Don't be surprised if the next roll-out you attend at
McDonnell Douglas is the roll-out of a new Douglas Aircraft Company that is
a global venture with owners from around the world.'

FT  03 MAR 93 / Personal View: Ten-point plan for credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The erosion of British manufacturing, which has been going on for much of
this century, is now a critical concern. In several sectors Britain no
longer has a credible presence. The goal must be to achieve world-class
levels of performance in design, engineering, manufacturing quality and cost
in sectors critical to the economy in the future. Nothing less will sustain
improvement over the long term. That will mean focusing on the problem by
sector and drawing in best-practice experience from all of them.
The way forward must also involve a change in our national culture.
Anti-industrial and manufacturing attitudes are still prevalent in many
quarters; innovation and success in manufacturing are not rewarded. Too few
of our best brains choose industry for a career.
The government must demonstrate vision and leadership by providing a clear,
broadly based national industrial strategy to embrace relevant aspects of
economic policy, education, infrastructure, energy, and investment. That
requires sectoral focus and the establishment of priorities and quantified
objectives for the short, medium and long term.
In the short term, during the next year, we must concentrate on creating the
best 'playing field' for our companies. The concept of Britain as the 'Hong
Kong of Europe' is compelling. That means continued deregulation, low
taxation and the removal of unnecessary constraints. In this way we also
eliminate many 'non-value-adding' elements in company cost bases. The role
of government should be to understand how it contributes to
'non-value-added' and to seek constantly to eliminate non-productive
processes and elements.
In the medium term, we must emulate the technological and manufacturing
superiority of our principal competitor nations, notably Germany and Japan.
Worldwide best practice must take root in the UK.
We must, as a matter of urgency, lay the foundations. An action plan now
would include:
Encourage investment with a return to 100 per cent first-year tax allowances
and provide relief based on investment for those companies with an ACT
burden.
Identify priority sectors in a national technology plan and target with
investment stimuli such as further tax incentives, R&amp;D funding and other
grants and concessions.
Improve export credit arrangements to put British manufacturers at least on
a level playing field with foreign competition and preferably ahead of the
game.
Devise new export incentives.
Mount a visible campaign to identity and eliminate official bureaucracy
stifling our businesses.
Commence the culture change needed by giving more publicity, reward and
acclaim to innovation and manufacturing success stories. Reform the honours
system to recognise science and engineering more widely.
Set up craft training schools (fachhochschule) in main manufacturing centres
to focus on skills and technologies in demand and train more young people.
Work with engineering representative bodies to raise the prestige of
engineers and ensure training for graduate engineers is improved to compare
with the best of other professions. Encourage a longer-term view of
investment in manufacturing, and particularly in advanced manufacturing
technology, for example, by providing special tax incentives for equity
investment in targeted priority sectors (if investment retained for
specified periods) and by setting up a national manufacturing investment
fund to make available low fixed interest, long-term funds for investment in
priority sector projects (funds to be bid for with assessment criteria
linked to a national technology plan).
Reform school curricula on science and technology and setting national
priorities for R&amp;D at universities.
In the long term, society must recognise that science and technology are the
principal instigators of progress for prosperity. We need a vision of an
elitist, technology-based society and a bold, innovative national technology
plan with nat-ional goals to realise this potential.

With their customary populist touch, foreign office mandarins are trying to
repel efforts to replace May Day bank holiday with Trafalgar Day. Though the
majority of those responding to the government's consultation exercise
favour a new autumn holiday to coincide with schools' half-term, the FCO is
wary of agreeing to October 21 for fear of reminding the French about the
battle they lost nearly 200 years ago.
Though it could simply be called the Autumn Bank Holiday, that doesn't have
quite the ring the government hoped for when it wanted to abolish the
'socialist' May Day. Expect Tory back-
benchers to settle for nothing less than 'Nelson day' at the very least.

Whatever else one might think about Eddie George, the next Governor of the
Bank of England, he is certainly a sound pair of hands when it comes to
chairing a meeting.
Take yesterday's elegant affair in Tokyo which he was refereeing. The City
of London side included some expensive stars like Sir David Walker, deputy
chairman of Lloyds Bank, Warburg's Sir David Scholey, and Sir Andrew
Hugh-Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange. The home team was represented by
Nomura's Yukio Aida and Daiwa's Toshitoki Chino, among others.
Interrupting such speakers, when in full flood, could risk an international
financial incident. But George saved the day by letting them ramble on. 'I
have been monitoring the situation closely and I can tell you the deficit
was evenly spread,' George summed up. 'This reveals two things: the speakers
are equally undisciplined, but only moderately so and they received the kind
of understanding treatment people have come to expect from British
regulators.'

Now that Sir Phil Harris doesn't have to worry any more about chairing his
beloved Guy's hospital, he can get back to the serious business of making
money on his return to the stock market.
This will please those who enjoyed observing, if not participating in, the
progress of Harris Queensway up to its Pounds 450m leveraged takeover in
1988. His absence from the market has made it a duller place. His old
company survived only two years after Sir Phil sold out at a Pounds 70m
profit, showing just what a canny salesman he is. Sir Phil insists the
business would not have gone under if he had remained in charge.
Ever positive, the 50-year-old is bursting with enthusiasm about
Carpetright, the chain he plans to float this summer. Some things will be
different though. He promises no takeovers, and he says people 'will be
surprised by the cleanness of the accounts'.

What's so special about the Halifax Building Society? It hasn't had an
exciting public flotation like the Abbey National or been as profitable as
the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester.
Hence, there will be some pained expressions at Halifax HQ at the sight of a
25 per cent jump in Abbey National's assets to Pounds 71.8bn. True, the
Abbey is no longer a building society and its balance sheet has been
inflated by money market activities. But unless there has been some nifty
end-year window-dressing, it would be surprising if the Halifax balance
sheet is bigger than the Abbey's when it reports in a fortnight's time.
Take no notice of Halifax if it says that size doesn't matter any more.
Being the biggest was one of its few claims to fame.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When, in late 1990, Barclays Bank paid through the nose to buy the highly
regarded Bavarian private bank, Merck Finck &amp; Co, and immediately insisted
on making one of its own men a partner, there were knowing glances in rival
banking parlours. Was Barclays trying to show off on Deutsche Bank's home
turf?
Why interfere? Midland and Lloyds don't have any of their men masquerading
as partners of Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt and Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst
respectively, yet this has not prevented these banks from doing well. If
Merck Finck had been in trouble, as SMH once was, there might have been a
reason for putting a Brit into the partnership. But this was not the case.
Now, little more than two years later, Giles Davison, the Barclays partner
on the Merck letterhead, is quitting after 34 years with Barclays. Richard
Carden, Barclays' European boss, admits that there were policy differences
but beyond that is staying 'stumm'.
Merck Finck, by contrast, is unusually talkative. Of Davison, who was
relishing Munich's business and cultural whirl, spokesman Otto Gassner says:
'I cannot imagine anyone else who would have fitted in so well. It is a blow
to Merck Finck.' Sounds like old Davison might have gone a bit too native
for Barclays' comfort.
As for the rumoured policy differences, Gassner is happy to chip in his
thoughts. 'Merck Finck is always the playground in which conflicts between
the commercial and investment banking sides of the Barclays Group are worked
out.' Ouch.
Another sign of the power vacuum which some think currently exists at the
top of Barclays? Perhaps. But whatever the reason for the apparent
contretemps, some of Barclays' rivals will be permitting themselves a sly
smile.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Pensions at risk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY PRIVATE sector employers have long regarded the company pension fund as
a profit centre. Now, it seems, the government has cottoned on to the game:
it has a beady eye on the pension funds of the remaining nationalised
industries, which are worth a great deal more than the industries
themselves. The Department of Transport's proposals for dealing with British
Rail's pension funds after privatisation look a better deal for the public
finances than for the pensioners; and trustees of other public sector
pension schemes, including those of British Coal, are increasingly worried
that present and future pensioners could be deprived of significant rights
and benefits.
In most of the bigger privatisations accomplished to date, existing
employees have had the option of remaining in a fund where pension benefits,
including inflation-proofing, and improved benefits in the event of future
surpluses, were no less favourable than the arrangements before
privatisation. This will be true of existing employees of British Rail. But
for most of British Rail's 200,000 or so current and deferred pensioners it
is another matter. Either they can put their pensions nest egg into a closed
fund, where they take on the risk of a reduction of benefits if investment
performance is poor. Or they accept a government offer to buy out their
funds in exchange for the equivalent of an investment in index-linked gilts.
At first sight, the second option - which, bizarrely, entails the pension
fund being nationalised while the rail industry is privatised - appears
attractive, since it guarantees continuing inflation-proofing for pensions.
Yet, historically, index-linked gilts have tended to underperform equities,
which form the bedrock of a normal pension fund portfolio. Moreover, the
railmen have, under their present scheme, enjoyed a share of pension fund
surpluses. Unlike private sector schemes, where the employer pays the
balance of the cost of meeting pension liabilities after a fixed
contribution from the employees, many nationalised industry funds operate on
shared costs. Employer and employee have contributed in a fixed ratio, and
the surplus has been shared, with employees enjoying contribution holidays
as well as the employer, and the less well-off pensioners receiving uplifts
in benefits.
As for the first option, the prospect of benefit improvements would be poor,
because trustees would have to adopt a cautious investment policy in a
closed fund with no new income coming in - not an enticing swap for people
who have hitherto enjoyed both security and improved benefits.
The government's proposals may not be the most ruthless example of pension
fund stripping. But benefits are being diluted. This will do nothing to
enhance confidence in a pensions system that has suffered gravely from the
activities of the late Robert Maxwell. The government should think again and
offer BR pensioners a deal that is genuinely no less favourable than the
status quo.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Smith squares up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Smith's speech on constitutional reform, delivered with little
fanfare on Monday night, will do him good. The UK Labour leader observed
that too much government power is held at the centre and exercised in
secret. Since the Conservatives first took office in 1979 local government
has increasingly been hamstrung. A new tribe of unelected, boards,
executives and committees has sprung up to run schools, hospitals and
hived-off agencies spawned by Whitehall. Actions of the state have become
more difficult to hold to account.
Few of the items in Mr Smith's list of proposed remedies are revolutionary.
He would give local authorities 'clear statutory powers, a reasonable and
stable financial structure, and enough autonomy to find practical local
solutions . . . ' A 'new tier' of government would be installed in Scotland,
which makes some sense, and in Wales and the regions of England, for which
the case has yet to be proved. Mr Smith's opinion that the 'all-powerful
nation state' is 'outdated' is not shared by everyone. His classification of
the ideal European model of decision-making as four-layered (municipal,
regional, national and European) would not be controversial in most of the
European Community.
The Labour leader's suggestion that the European Convention on Human Rights
be incorporated into British law lays to rest his predecessor's messy
compromise of a set of bills of rights tailor-made to suit Labour policies.
It is also in accord with the views of senior judges. Mr Smith over-eggs the
pudding with his proposed Human Rights Commission and Ministry of Justice,
but the intention, to protect individuals, is honourable. He quotes the
Financial Times in support of a Freedom of Information Act. No comment.
Economic policy is best made with as much openness as possible. The Labour
leader muses about a 'Green Budget', confirms his party's plan for an annual
'state of the nation' report, promises to end the ritual of pre-Budget
purdah and, temptingly, argues that the Central Statistical Office should be
made statutorily independent, accountable to Parliament, and supervised by a
special panel. He reflects his party's obsession with high earnings in his
call for 'the cobwebs of unnecessary secrecy' around boardrooms to be blown
away, but seems to limit his proposals to those in last year's Cadbury
report.
In sum, Mr Smith's modest slate of reforms would move his party further
towards the centre. He says nothing about proportional representation for
elections to the House of Commons, although he will have to come clean
before Labour's conference in the autumn. His wider strategy therefore
remains obscure. If he wanted a pact with the Liberal Democrats, he would
test the water by persuading the Labour party to stand aside from the
forthcoming by-election in Newbury. Meanwhile he has made a canny bid for
Liberal Democrat votes.

emergency aid to besieged Moslem communities in eastern Bosnia; the first
was humanitarian, the second political. The difficulty that United Nations
land convoys were having in delivering relief supplies to people in areas
controlled by Serb militias seemed to justify a new approach.
But at least equally important for Washington was the political
consideration that, after all the criticism of Serb atrocities during the
presidential election campaign, the new president should be seen to act in
line with his principles. The real problem is that members of the
administration still seem to disagree over their longer-term policy options.
With painful memories of the Vietnam war still relatively fresh, direct
military intervention was never a realistic proposition and proposals to arm
the Moslems ran into the stiff and well-founded opposition of the US's
allies with troops on the ground.
Though the administration's dislike of the international mediators' plan for
the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces has
been well-publicised, the US has not, so far, come up with a viable
alternative. Indeed, it has been obliged to pay lip service to the
Vance-Owen plan in the knowledge that it is fully backed by Russia, Britain
and France, all permanent members of the UN Security Council, which would
have to endorse a Bosnian peace settlement.
In the circumstances, the air-drops must be seen as at least partly a
political gesture targeted as much at domestic American opinion as on
eastern Bosnia. Yet that operation must not be allowed to divert
international attention from the efforts to achieve a peace settlement or
from the need for the US to pull its full weight in the talks which resumed
in New York on Monday.
When the US announced its new 'initiative' on Bosnia last month, the
administration made clear that it wanted to work in close association with
Russia, in the hope that Moscow would exert pressure on its Serbian allies
to make compromises. But the corollary of such a policy is that Washington,
too, should try to persuade its Moslem proteges to adopt a more flexible
approach.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, has lately proved to be
particularly intractable and has refused to lead his delegation in the peace
talks. The suffering and grievances of his people are indisputable, but he
must be made to realise that a durable peace settlement is in his own
people's most fundamental interests.
The assurance the US has given that it will make a substantial contribution
to the international force required to enforce a peace agreement should
provide the kind of long-term guarantee the Moslems are looking for.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Those were the days: Transcaucasia may welcome a reassertion
of Russian power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The ebbing of Russian power after the 1917 revolution seemed to provide
more auspicious conditions in which the national aspirations of the peoples
of Transcaucasia could be realised. As it turned out, Russia's weakness
proved only temporary . . . The record of the independent republics of
Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia established in the interim was in any case
not particularly promising.'
The quote is from Post-Soviet Transcaucasia by Jonathan Aves (RIIA, Pounds
6.50) - the latest in the impressive series of papers produced by Chatham
House's Post-Soviet Business Forum. And the question it raised for me - one
that has been nagging away at the back of my mind ever since the Soviet
Union began to break up - was: will history repeat itself?
For if one thing emerges clearly from Mr Aves's paper, it is that the record
of those three republics is not very promising this time round, either.
Armenia and Azerbaijan have been gradually destroying each other since 1988
in the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, while Georgia has been
destroying itself almost single-handedly.
Georgia's leaders, it is true, tend to blame Russia for stirring up trouble,
notably in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Mr Aves, a
lecturer in Russian government at the London School of Economics, only
partially endorses such accusations. He is much more scathing about the
Georgian leaders themselves, especially the self-appointed defence minister,
Mr Tengiz Kitovani. Even the widely respected former Soviet foreign
minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, does not come out too well.
Mr Aves admits that Mr Shevardnadze's return to head the Georgian government
a year ago 'established the credentials of the new regime', but he goes on
to point out that, 'dominated by ex-communists', the government has so far
taken no significant measures to promote economic reform, 'despite the
republic's catastrophic economic situation'.
At the same time he detects a 'drift towards authoritarianism'. A
personality cult appears to be emerging around Mr Shevardnadze, and critics
of the government find it increasingly difficult to express their views.
Mr Aves is equally pessimistic about Azerbaijan, in spite of its relative
good fortune in having 'a strong agricultural base and enough oil to give it
a trade surplus with the other republics'. Paradoxically, he says, 'these
economic strengths have combined with political turmoil to retard plans for
economic reform', since the government 'appears to believe that future
income from oil removes the need for rapid change'.
At the same time, military reverses at the hands of the Armenians have
undermined political stability, and the hold on power of President Abul'faz
El'chibei, the nationalist leader who came to power last year, 'is by no
means to be taken for granted'.
Armenia's President Levon Ter-Petrosian gets slightly better marks, for
introducing at least some economic reforms, and having the political skill
to consolidate his power base without resorting to authoritarianism. But
such compliments will ring hollow in the ears of the many Armenians now
enduring their second winter in unheated apartments, and often short of
food, thanks to the Azerbaijani blockade and the repeated sabotage of the
gas pipeline through Georgia.
Nor is Armenia's political stability exactly obvious when, since Mr Aves's
paper went to press, the president has had to dismiss his prime minister
(for denouncing the government's own economic plan in a speech to
parliament), the opposition has spurned the president's offers of a
coalition government, and over 100,000 people have demonstrated in the
capital, Yerevan, demanding his resignation.
More ominous still is Mr Aves's warning that, although Armenia had the best
of last year's fighting, the odds favour an Azerbaijani military victory in
the long run. Armenia, he points out, has few natural resources and no
outlet to the sea, being 'bordered by an unreliable ally, in the form of
Georgia, an uneasy partner, in the form of Iran, a hostile regional power,
in the form of Turkey, and a declared enemy, in the form of Azerbaijan'.
There must, Mr Aves says, 'be a serious question mark over the long-term
future of the state'.
Although Armenians, radicalised by the Karabakh issue, were one of the first
Soviet peoples to demand independence in the late 1980s, they are also the
one with most to lose when Russian influence in their region declines.
In 1920 Armenia had to beg for Russian protection to prevent itself being
overrun by the Turks; and by 1992 it had become, alone in the region, 'a
loyal and enthusiastic member' of the Russian-dominated Commonwealth of
Independent States.
Most Armenians will therefore be glad to hear that 'in 1992 there has been a
perceptible reassertion of Russian influence in Transcaucasia', and may even
hope that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, obtains the United
Nations mandate he requested for his country last Sunday, to serve as
'guarantor of peace and stability' throughout the former Soviet Union.
Pax Russica is, after all, the only peace that Transcaucasia has known in
the last two centuries; and the chances of its peoples making peace
spontaneously among themselves seem very slight.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Hitting the roof over reform: Calls for changes to UK
commercial property leases are gathering pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Upwards-only rent review clauses seem designed for a world which had the
certainty of an upwards-only pattern of property values. This pattern is not
in the interest of the economy as a whole, and the thrust of our
anti-inflationary policy is intended to make it obsolete.'
Bank of England
The row unleashed last week over the UK government's plans to allow
leaseholders to buy the freehold of their homes is matched by a quite
separate but equally controversial debate over leases in the commercial
sector.
Since the Bank of England threw its weight behind the case for reform in
January, the battle has continued to rage. Its attack focused on one of the
most cherished principles of the UK property investment industry: that rents
should move only upwards after their five-yearly reviews.
It also criticised the 'apparently absurd outcomes' that stem from privity
of contract, another mainstay of the standard 25-year commercial lease. This
means that tenants who pass on a lease when they cease to occupy a building
remain liable for rent if a subsequent tenant defaults. The system was an
example 'of responsibility without power', said Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
the Bank's governor.
His remarks drew an angry response from many commercial landlords, who
depend heavily on the reliability of the rental income. 'The Bank appears to
be sweeping the carpet out from under our feet,' said Mr Michael Mallinson,
a past president of the British Property Federation.
Mr John Ritblat, chairman of the property company British Land, concurred:
'It was an uninformed, impoverished statement that was greatly damaging to
the industry.'
But the Bank of England has not been alone. As the recession deepened, the
case for change was voiced by businesses, politicians and academics with
increasing urgency. Mrs Angela Browning, Conservative MP for Tiverton, in a
Commons debate last November, cited the example of some constituents who had
been forced to sell their home to discharge rental debts relating to former
premises.
'This has done more to devastate small businesses than even global
recession,' she said. But privity of contract is not simply a problem for
small businesses. Boots the Chemist made a provision of Pounds 5.8m in its
last financial year related to 'leases where the assignees have defaulted'.
The Adam Smith Institute, the free-market think-tank, recently published a
paper arguing that the rigid UK lease structure that allowed rents to rise
while retailers' turnover was falling 'had created a situation of
nightmarish crisis on the high street'. As well as condemning the structure
of leases, it criticised the process by which rents are agreed and the
prevalence of confidentiality clauses on the terms of rent agreements, which
it claimed tended to favour the landlord.
Critics emphasise that the 25-year, upwards-only lease is almost unknown
outside Britain. US and continental leases are generally far shorter and
less rigid. In France, for example, tenants sign leases for nine years, with
the right to break the lease every three years. Rent reviews are pegged to
inflation.
Some aspects of the system differ in Scotland and Northern Ireland, which
have no privity of contract. Tenants have no continuing liability once they
have passed their leases to another tenant. However, investors enjoy some
protection, as they have the right to stop the lease being passed on to a
financially weaker tenant.
Many UK investors would be prepared to replace privity of contract with the
Scottish approach. A few landlords are prepared to question whether a
25-year lease acts in their interest. They believe that slightly shorter
leases, perhaps of 15 years, might enhance their property's value, as it
would give them a chance to upgrade the building more regularly to attract
higher rents.
But, in general, most landlords view with dismay any suggestion that they
should relinquish the present UK lease structure. They say any change would
severely reduce property values by undermining the security of their rental
income. They argue that the impact of falling commercial property values
could go beyond their own industry and damage the entire economy.
First, it could further reduce institutions' appetite for property. That
would be a blow for the banks, which are concerned about how the record
Pounds 39bn they have lent to the industry over the past few years is to be
repaid.
Second, there is a danger that the erosion of companies' asset values could
hamper their capacity to borrow, and thus stifle the growth that would spur
economic recovery. Commercial property accounts for 30-40 per cent of
companies' assets, according to a London Business School study.
This fear is given credence by a recent study by the Centre for Economics
and Business Research for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The
report calculates that a 10 per cent drop in property prices would result in
a Pounds 10bn fall in borrowing over the next two years. This would reduce
gross domestic product by about 1.5 per cent or Pounds 9.7bn over the period
compared with what it would have been if property prices had not fallen.
The landlords' defence of the existing lease structure extends to claiming
that it works in the tenants' best interests. 'The irony of the debate about
upwards-only reviews is this: only in the current extreme situation does
that provision work against tenants' interests,' said Mr Mick Newmarch,
chief executive of the Prudential life group.
He argued that, if security of income were removed and institutions became
less willing to invest in property, the supply of property would dwindle and
rents would rise. 'If the laments of tenants win the day, they will actually
be doing themselves more harm than good,' he said.
This argument cuts little ice with tenants. With few exceptions, they view
their landlords' interests as incompatible with their own. Their hope is
that the property market will remain weak for long enough to allow them to
make lasting changes in Britain's commercial lease structure.
Already, many leases signed in the past year involve concessions by
landlords - such as giving the tenant the right to break the lease - which
would have been unimaginable a few years ago. But without government
intervention, reform is likely to be a slow process, since on average just 4
per cent of leases expire in any year.
The pressure for change creates a dilemma for the government, which promised
to consider overhauling privity of contract in its manifesto last year.
However, the Lord Chancellor, who has been lobbied intensively by both sides
of the debate, has not yet arrived at a suitable compromise.
There is a conflict between the needs of struggling tenants and the rights
of landlords, who say they would take the government to the European Court
if it passed 'confiscatory' legislation affecting existing contracts. 'The
government is on a hiding to nothing,' says one of its advisers. 'They have
strong constituencies among the property industry and among small business
people. They will risk alienating one side or another.'
One area in which the government could act is by legislating on new leases,
which could remove privity of contract, upwards-only rent reviews and
confidentiality clauses. While this would be seen by many landlords as an
unwarranted interference in the free market, it would nevertheless be less
controversial than any tampering with existing leases.
For the Conservatives, the dilemma is acute. The government is reluctant to
interfere with a system that underpins the strength and security of many
financial institutions, from pension funds to banks. Nonetheless, the
recession has illustrated powerfully the case for an overhaul. Otherwise,
property's importance as an investment medium risks overshadowing its more
fundamental productive role in the British economy.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Letter: Verdict on NHS reforms should reflect impact on
patients
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID BLUNKETT MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read John Willman's review of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development report, The Reform of Healthcare
('Just what the doctor ordered', March 1). As Mr Willman rightly points out,
the OECD can draw no final conclusions on the changes that have been brought
either in Britain or the Netherlands.
Nevertheless, it is pertinent to ask the question as to how any final
conclusions will be drawn.
Who are the changes expected to have benefited? Is it - as the cutting of
costs indicates - governments and the Treasury which are to benefit? Or is
it - as any sensible person would expect - the patients who are supposed to
be the beneficiaries?
These are crucial questions when National Health Service changes have
resulted in rocketing waiting lists and a two-tier health service, with GP
fundholders obtaining minor treatment for their patients while serious
surgery is delayed for many others. This situation has forced the secretary
of state for health to admit, as she did last Friday, that the internal
market has led to delays in urgent treatment, as hospitals simply run out of
money.
I hope that the OECD will now connect up with those receiving health
treatment so that further reports will make a judgment on outcomes and not
merely inputs into the system.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Letter: How the government has made life more difficult for
many exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CAMPBELL DUNFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was very pleased to see the article by lvor Owen, 'Minister defends
ECGD sell-off' (February 23), regarding the comments made by Richard
Needham, the trade minister, on the privatisation of the bulk of the Export
Credits Guarantee Department.
It is also encouraging to perceive that Mr Needham is concerned about the
vital nature of credit insurance to the UK economy, the balance of payments
and employment. But there are several points that require expansion.
The minister has said that the reinsurance arrangements to NCM, which bought
the short-term credit arm of the ECGD, would be continued without any time
limit. This is not generally understood and indeed represents a significant
step forward.
Second, while it may be true that NCM has secured adequate reinsurance
treaties, the reinsurance market has shrunk and other would-be competitors
might find it difficult to obtain reinsurance.
Third, while supporting any initiative to help our beleaguered export
industry, it seems strange that government reinsurance is available only to
a Dutch-owned company and not to any of the other competitors in the market.
This is a matter which is being looked at in Brussels right now.
Experience from our members would suggest that, while welcoming the
privatisation of this arm of ECGD, the government has probably made life
more difficult for many exporters in terms of the range of markets covered
and the lack of support for other companies wishing to enter the market.
In spite of the minister's confident assertion, it does appear that
availability of cover for traditional UK markets has been restricted or
withdrawn, and appeals to the DTI on this matter have largely fallen on deaf
ears.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Letter: Diversity as a function of managerial
characteristics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Lorenz's piece, 'Shaking off the heavy brigade' (February
26), in which he argues that diversity is dying in business, correctly
knocks another nail in the coffin of 'diversity'.
He rightly defines diversity as a function of managerial characteristics
rather than product, market or industry.
A premium product may have widely different managerial characteristics from
a low-cost product, even though both are part of the same industry.
As a result, speciality chemicals can be seen to be different from commodity
chemicals because of their differing managerial characteristics.
These different managerial characteristics demand different skills from the
parent company, making the two types of chemical business awkward
bedfellows.
Mr Lorenz does, however, dismiss 'cross-business synergies' somewhat too
readily when, summing up the axioms of what he calls the new orthodoxy in
business, he says that 'cross-business 'synergies' of any kind -
technological, marketing or any other - are far more elusive than was
commonly thought in the 1960s and 1970s'.
In our research at the Ashridge Strategic Management Centre, we have
identified many situations where businesses benefit from co-ordinating with
each other.
Cross-business synergies are not scarce, but we have noted that only a very
small portion of these synergies need a parent company to release them.
The synergies can in fact be gained by the mutual consent of the businesses
regardless of who owns them.
Only certain kinds of synergies, that is, those involving blockages to
arm's-length solutions, require the existence of a parent company.
To borrow Mr Lorenz's analogy, the sap may be flowing between businesses,
but it is only in a very few situations that this flow needs to be
'parented'.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Letter: Proposal at Lloyd's unfair to Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From F S R JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 'The incredible shrinking market' on Lloyd's problems (FT 24
February), Richard Lapper reports that increasingly market professionals
want to 'fence off' old liabilities by leaving syndicate accounts for 1990
open.
It is normal at Lloyd's to leave years of account open when they cannot be
closed in the usual way after three years because debt or potential debt is
so high as to make it unreasonable to ask new Names to take part in dealing
with it.
It is quite another matter to compulsorily ban all syndicates from closing
their 1990 year of account based, not on their individual commercial results
for 1990, which in many cases would legitimately allow closure, but on a
perceived need to encourage members of the corporate sector and others to
join Lloyd's and improve its capital base by insulating them from past
problems.
I understand the need for Lloyd's to restore its shrinking capital base. But
a measure such as this would introduce a two-tier membership. It would
penalise the existing membership, the source of Lloyd's capital so far, and
perpetuate the despair of those looking to escape from the worry of their
Lloyd's commitments by seeing their syndicates closed legitimately at the
three-year point. F Johnson,

FT  03 MAR 93 / Arts: Picking on Cherry - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an unfortunate person sometimes heard at London jazz concerts. He
seems compelled to react loudly, in the silence of a large auditorium, to
whatever crosses his mind at any moment.
I rather wished this tormented soul had been present at the Nu Now concert
on the South Bank earlier this week, when Don Cherry first croaked into his
pocket trumpet. He might have startled the old man of world music into more
coherent action. That Cherry has a uniquely elusive but persuasive sound is
without doubt, but his wandering concentration and arthritic trumpet playing
on Monday was initially beyond comprehension.
Fortunately, the rest of the Nu Now quartet - the bubbling rhythm of Bob
Stewart on tuba, kinetic Hamid Drake on drums and Carlos Ward's sleek alto
saxophone - delivered support with such flowing momentum that the early
inertia of Cherry's playing was all but overcome. Creeping unsteadily around
the piano in black tailcoat and embroidered pill box hat or squatting
uncomfortably on his dais with shakers, doussn'gourni and melodica,
Cherry seemed unable to penetrate material which ranged between Nu Now
originals, music from Ornette Coleman and Thelonious Monk. By the end of the
first set, which ground to a halt with Cherry endlessly tuning the trademark
six string African guitar, the doussn'gourni, the Queen Elizabeth Hall
squirmed.
Thankfully Cherry appeared after the interval sounding more purposeful:
especially at the piano where in a Monk medley he contrived to sound even
more dislocated than the original. Ward tangled excitingly with angular
rhythms from Drake, and Stewart's golden, classical tone flared in a
long-awaited solo excursion. Perhaps fired by his colleagues' enthusiasm
Cherry finally managed to make a mouth for the muted trumpet.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Arts: The Artifice - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Susanna Centlivre (c 1667-1723) was one of the first women playwrights. She
was also the most prolific and popular of either sex in the early part of
the 18th century, a period which included Congreve, Farquhar and Wycherley.
She continued to be a box office success with such plays as The Busy Body
and The Wonder until well into the reign of Queen Victoria. In the present
century she has been forgotten, except as a curiosity.
There is much to be curious about. She probably came from Lincolnshire,
attended Cambridge dressed as a boy, and then became a strolling player.
Somewhere she must have picked up French, for the French influence in her
works is very strong. One of her husbands (she may have had three
altogether) was killed in a duel. The last was Joseph Centlivre, who
occupied a senior place in the Queen's kitchen, just below the level of
master cook. Alexander Pope, who mocked Mrs Centlivre in 'The Dunciad', thus
referred to her as the cook's wife.
In politics she was a Whig and a Protestant. As a dramatist, her great merit
was that she wrote parts that actors like David Garrick wanted to play again
and again. So it is good to see her revived at the delightful Orange Tree
Theatre in Richmond. There must be a question mark, however, over the choice
of play.
The Artifice is her last work. It ran only three nights at Drury Lane in
1722. John Wilson Bowyer, an American who wrote a book (1952) about Mrs
Centlivre, says that it contains 'some of the worst elements of three
dramatic schools - light manners, busy intrigues and sentimental reformation
 -and is really a failure in all.'
Wilson Bowyer did not understate. The Artifice has no central plot, only a
number of subplots which do not relate to each other much. The common themes
are marital infidelity and the pursuit of wealth and titles, but without the
interweaving that you would find in a Congreve or a Sheridan.
Still, Mrs Centlivre could certainly write. There is a pompous country
gentleman called Mr Watchit, played here by David Timson, who is very
jealous of his wife - and locks her up while he philanders. Louisa, a Dutch
lady jilted by an Englishman, enjoys herself by pretending that she has
poisoned him while they share a last embrace. She wins him in the end.
Best of all is the ambitious Widow Heedless (Auriol Smith), worth Pounds
20,000, embittered by her first marriage and resolved not to marry again
beneath the level of a lord. She succumbs to a captain of a regiment who was
posing as her footman.
Individually, these parts are sharply drawn. Others, like Sir Philip
Moneylove who thinks that money is all that counts, are much flatter. The
pity is that none of them fits together. But such shortcomings in the text
are at least partially overcome by the infectious enthusiasm of the
production by Sam Walters. The performances are better than the play, and
this is a curiosity worth seeing.

'Do you know how scared that makes me? Every day I feel I'm going to cave in
if I give way to one of these memories.' Frances, a young woman, is haunted
by her own past; and she is possessed by it. So possessed that she feels as
if she has no freedom to act independently; and so haunted that she has had
to isolate whole facets of her personality and sometimes to banish them from
her present life.
It emerges that she was sexually abused by her grandfather from the age of
six onwards; that she was called 'the devil's child'; that her mother
visited so sporadically that Frances did not realise who she was; and more.
All of which Frances tells herself. Part of the wit of Not Fade Away is the
way you do not know for some time that the man she is talking to is a
psychoanalyst; or that Frances contains so many selves that she is a
traumatic case of schizophrenia. By the time you know, you care. She has
done horrific things; you never fully understand her, or all that has
happened to her; but you care.
The author is Richard Cameron, whose Pond Life had a notable success at the
Bush last year. The most tormented character in that play about adolescents
was a girl called Togo, from whom Frances seems to have been developed. But
here Cameron has a different angle. We never see Frances in everyday social
context. She is either alone or talking to the analyst. And we (unlike him)
keep hearing (on tape) the several voices in her head - except when, alone
on the performing stage of her mind, she sings, powerfully, pop classics.
Sometimes it is as if we are in her head.
Any description, however, must detract; as with Pond Life, the best
enjoyment comes simply in watching it surprise you as it unfolds. It is full
of truth, right down to details of the pyschoanalyst's body language. Only
once or twice do you sense that this tour de force has been conceived for
wow effect - there are scenes of possession that recall The Dybbuk - and
that Frances's more poetic locutions do not ring true to her character. You
always watch her objectively, aware of her ultimate unknowability. The play
simply shows you fragments from her progress; sometimes too fragmented for
clarity.
Kelly Hunter is Frances. This is an astonishing performance, not least
because most of its virtuosity is invisible. With complete ease, she shows
Frances as child, slut, prude, innocent, victim, tormentor, and the various
ways these facets conflict or combine.
Not Fade Away, like Pond Life, is directed by Simon Usher and designed by
Anthony Lamble - the duo who have also staged James Robson's remarkable King
Baby for the RSC, currently at the Pit. It is now evident that Usher (though
I presume he is responsible for the white-voiced and raised-eyebrow version
of childish innocence that here repeats from Pond Life) has a rare gift for
handling plays that deal with psychological anguish and confession. And
Lamble, as in Pond Life, shows great skill in turning the small Bush space
into three wholly distinct interiors. Congratulations to all concerned.
At the Bush Theatre, W12, till March 20

<TEXT>
Every few years someone in the US writes a best selling book which blames
one mass medium or another for the ills of society, particularly the
violence. First horror comics, then movies, were the butt; then, about 30
years ago, television became the favourite target. Each focused so tightly
upon one particular tree that the writer is incapable of observing the wood
beyond: the whole span of human history with its wars, tribal conflicts and
rape; horrible violence perpetrated in the name of everything from religion
to political belief, from territorial greed to entertainment.
The danger and sadness of such books is that they offer unthinking people an
easy escape from unpleasant realities. Many jump at the opportunity to blame
television for virtually anything: sexual abuse of children, juvenile
delinquency, and inner city riots, even though all have been a part of human
society for millennia. Repeatedly this column has pointed out the silliness
of calling for the censorship of television as though that would somehow
change human nature. The response 'Ah, but television makes it all so much
worse and increases the numbers of abusers/delinquents/rioters' suggests a
failure to read Mayhew, Dickens, or even old copies of Punch in order to
understand how bad things used to be.
However, the most recent book is couched in such reasonable terms, so
willing to concede that the mass media alone are not responsible for all our
ills, that it commands more attention than most. True, author Michael Medved
is more concerned with the cinema than television, hence the title:
Hollywood vs. America. But the chapter published this week in the Sunday
Times is devoted to rock music, including the output on the cable and
satellite channel MTV.
As introduction Medved notes 'I do not claim that media messages cause
destructive behaviour, but I do contend that they encourage it. At the same
time, I never stress the pernicious power of one movie, or one TV show, or
one hit song. What concerns me is the accumulated impact of irresponsible
messages that are repeated hour after hour, year after year. The most
significant problems of the popular culture stem from the pervasive presence
of anti-social material, not from a few isolated examples of offensiveness.'
He then gives an undeniably unpleasant catalogue of rock lyrics involving
the subjection of women, necrophilia, sado-masochism, and mutilation of
female genitals. Specifically he quotes the lines from a Guns 'n Roses
number: 'Panties round your knees with your arse in debris . . . Tied up,
tied down, up against the wall . . . Turn around bitch I got a use for you'
and more. He quotes a research study by America's National Coalition on
Television Violence from the winter of 1991 which examined 750 music videos
from cable and broadcast television and discovered an average of 20 acts of
violence per hour. On MTV, he reports, the situation was even more extreme:
29 instances of violent imagery in an average hour of programming.
I still feel that television mimics people much more than people mimic
television, but there were two things in this particular instance which
hinted that there might be more reason than usual for concern. First, my own
casual viewing of MTV via the Astra satellite suggested that unlike other
channels, where a violent or otherwise objectionable programme will
invariably be surrounded by different and mainly unobjectionable material,
MTV, a channel dedicated pretty well exclusively to rock videos, might be
producing abnormal concentrations of nasty material. Second, some parents
seemed to use MTV as a sort of baby-sitter for bigger children, not merely
allowing them to watch it on their own for hours on end but flatly refusing
to watch with them on account of the ghastly noise.
If such concentrations did exist, and if children were left to imbibe it for
hours alone, might this not eventually have some effect? On Sunday evening,
leaving the video to capture A Year In Provence, Prague in the 'Screen Two'
series and the South Bank Show on Jean Genet, I switched to MTV and stayed
with it for hour after hour.
It was a deeply dispiriting experience, though not, chiefly, for the reasons
advanced by Medved. No doubt he would have been appalled at the words of the
song 'School For Fools' by Love Sex And Death, who have presumably been
listening to Pink Floyd: 'Whaddya learn at school? School's for fools.
Teacher tells yer what ter say, teacher tells yer when ter pray, whaddya
learn in school? Nothing', and the lyrics to 'Razzmataz' by Pulp (or it
could have been 'Pulp' by Razzmataz) which began 'The trouble with your
brother is he's always sleeping with your mother . . .'
But that sort of thing was just as rare as the remarkable (borrowed) words
to 'Here Comes The War' from New Model Army: 'Put out the lights on the age
of reason . . . the whirling dervish spinning faster and faster, the centre
cannot hold . . . give us liberty or give us death'. Mostly on MTV the words
 -when they could be heard by a normal person which was less than half the
time - were like objets trouves: ill assorted and meaningless. Perhaps
European MTV is different from the American version but, on this night in
Britain, at any rate, the objection was more often tedium than corruption.
Perhaps Medved would argue against this, claiming that there are as many
examples here as in the US of what he calls 'a contemptuous attitude towards
religion'. Certainly lots of bands seem to have followed Madonna and taken
to using the trappings of religion in a profoundly irreverent way. Yet if
you regard religious organisation as frequently one of the more pernicious
aspects of human society this may not worry you, and if you are opposed to
the overloading of violent imagery then presumably you will approve attempts
to devitalise the most widespread violent image in the western world: the
head and torso of a man, dripping blood from a crown of thorns. That
familiar image certainly featured large on Sunday night.
But a solid evening of Anglo-European MTV produces other worries. The sheer
tedium of group after group offering nothing but guitar and drums with
occasional keyboards has to be experienced to be believed. From Les Thugs to
Man-O-War, from Distortion to Protect And Survive all they offer is an
undifferentiated outpouring of rhythmical noise. Was I imagining it, or were
things utterly different when I was 17? I checked the 1961 charts and found
everything from Dave Brubeck to Nat King Cole and Petula Clark. True, there
was rhythmical noise from The Shadows but there was also melody from the
Everly Brothers and real tunes from Ray Charles.
Perhaps European television still spares our children the worst excesses of
its American counterpart, but the rock video seems to be killing the art of
popular music and putting in its place a drearily meaningless sequence of
unconnected images: fire, desert, motor cars and motorbikes, crucifixes,
leather jeans, and back to fire. Watching it for more than five minutes must
surely seem, to anyone with even a spark of intelligence, like purgatory.

Athol Fugard's Playland is the best play to arrive in London since Tony
Kushner's Angels in America at the Royal National Theatre last year. The
piece has a seriousness of purpose and a tautness of writing seldom seen on
a European stage. It is not just that the subject matters, though by God it
does: everything in the production lives up to it.
Fugard, now in his early sixties, has a prolific output behind him. His last
play at the National, My Children] My Africa] was a relative flop, partly
because it was written before, but presented after, the release of Nelson
Mandela. In Playland Fugard returns to being the dramatic chronicler of his
times: the man who can present hope out of despair.
The background is the war in what used to be called South West Africa -
South Africa's Vietnam. It is new year's eve 1989: the war is over. Two
characters come together outside a fairground. One is a white South African
former corporal whose experience of killing has left him an emotional wreck,
but also perhaps a wiser man. The other is the black nightwatchman, who has
been guarding the fair for years.
They talk: or rather at the start the white man talks almost to the point of
monologue. He is not especially bitter. He accepts that blacks and whites
will have to live together. Gradually, however, there is a role reversal:
the watchman begins to talk.
The ostensible subject is killing. The watchman believes the sixth
commandment: 'Thou shalt not.' The white cannot get over seeing a record 27
members of SWAPO killed and buried by his unit on one day. But the black,
too, has committed murder: he killed a white man for attempting to sleep
with his woman. Moreover, despite his belief in the commandments, he is not
sorry and would do it again.
Fugard is now a master of dialogue. The facts about both characters slip
out. Sometimes they revert to an atavistic past. The white claims there is
nothing wrong with a white man taking a black woman against her will:
'That's how little white boys learn to do it. And you know something else:
the women like it.' Sometimes the watchman simply wants the white to go
away.
Yet the antagonism that occasionally breaks out is not the whole theme. The
underlying point is about mutual dependency, liking the same things, such as
the freedom to watch the birds in the South African skies and to laugh not
the 'laughter of lies'.
Most impressive of all, none of this is piously done. There is no suggestion
that all whites have learned the same lesson from the war. Indeed the white
soldier now feels estranged from his own people. Here are simply two
individuals talking.
Fugard leaves no doubt, however, that they are both identifiably South
Africans, and know it. The skill with which he does this is shown in the
language. They have begun to share words and accents. This is almost the
first time that I have found an Afrikaans accent on stage sympathetic.
The acting by John Kani as the black and Sean Taylor as the white is
impeccable. Fugard himself directs down to his fingertips and there should
be a special prize for the lighting - note the coming of dawn - by Mannie
Manim. The Donmar Warehouse, small like the Market Theatre in Johannesburg,
is exactly the right place for Playland.

You might have thought that Darwinian evolution would ensure that the
utterly credulous were bred out of the human race, yet it does not seem to
happen. Today we look on in astonishment as American viewers dutifully post
millions to American telly evangelists who splurge it on wine, women and
song. People have learned nothing, it seems, since 1830 when preacher John
Wroe managed to convince his followers in Ashton-under-Lyne that god had
told him to take seven virgins into his household for his 'comfort and
succour'. You or I would have said 'Pull the other one, it plays the wedding
march' yet, according to the opening episode of Mr Wroe's Virgins, (9.25
BBC2) acquiring his 'helpers' was no trouble at all. Today's episode tells
the story of Joanna who wants to be a missionary but is prevented because
she is a woman. Two programmes which I missed are repeated tonight: Victoria
Wood (8.30 BBC1) is from the 1989 series which were not stand-up routines or
skits but rather like single episode sitcoms. Dispatches (9.00 C4) repeats
the award-winning programme about children living on the streets of St
Petersburg.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Arts: Mozart on the Fringe - Music Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

<TEXT>
Figaro starts the opera by mapping out his new room: 'TV . . . Video . . .
Hi-fi . . . CD . . .' Leporello keeps the list of Giovanni's conquests on
his pocket computer. Susanna wants to know if Figaro likes the new colour in
her hair. Rosina summons her maid with a bleeper. Ottavio (rhymes with
'gravy-oh') calls Anna 'Kitten' and 'Precious.' Cherubino gets sent to the
Brecon Beacons for a fortnight with the OTC. Don Giovanni (call me Don)
launches the finale with a paean to sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.
This up-to-date modernity is just the top layer of Music Theatre London's
versions of Figaro and Giovanni, which come to London after a triumphant
tour of Germany and Austria. (Figaro has been considerably revised since
last shown in London; Giovanni has been adjusted.) Still, if that were all,
these stagings would be little better than the Peter Sellars productions
seen on TV two years back. (Well, they would certainly be funnier - a big
plus. And they would use the language of their audience - another.)
But there are other revelations. The best comes, I think, in casting both
operas with skilled actors, who never place vocal effect above communicative
singing. Put the words first and you hear how natural Mozart makes the
voices sound - how far from high-art plush exclusivity he was.
The only people who should stay away are canary-fanciers and Ur-text
purists. It is Music Theatre London style to take more cuts than is usual in
the opera house and to replace almost all recitative with speech. Figaro
takes one cut too many - the great second-act trio - but it glides along.
(Though Giovanni sags slightly at two points - the Commendatore's, sorry,
Colonel's, death scene, and the coloratura of Anna's second aria - its
general pace is, if anything, livelier.) The singers bring off the
speech-song alternation with a naturalness that makes Figaro and Giovanni
work like musicals (without the laborious elocution that so often bogs down
the spoken bits in operas like The Magic Flute).
Another joy is the sheer musical and dramatic wit with which these versions
adapt Mozart to the 1990s. It is, of course, a hoot to see Rosina sing her
first aria on an Exercycle, but when her pedalling changes tempo with the
music, and as her singing never falters, the episode actually takes you
deeper into Figaro. The farcically misdelivered kiss and slap in the Act
Four finale work as well as I have seen them, but better yet is the moment
that follows: Cherubino, escaping, bumps into both Figaro and Susanna and
looks fleetingly aghast as he takes in a realm of adult intrigue beyond his
comprehension.
Amid an excellent ensemble, the performances who best exemplify Music
Theatre London style are Liza Sadovy (Susanna and Zerlina) and William
Relton (Ottavio and Basilio). These two are the most natural actor-singers
of all, wonderful in their characterful underplaying; and the way
Relton/Basilio says 'Sounds like a bud in need of nipping, Sir' is among the
classic line-deliveries I have ever heard. Gerard Casey (Don G. and Sir
Cecil ie the Count) is almost as good, though he grievously over-extends
every pregnant pause. Simon Butteriss is both Masetto and Marcellina - yes -
which may be the most remarkable role-swapping since Lynn Seymour switched
from Carabosse to Aurora overnight in 1977; though he pulls faces too much,
he is a marvellously amusing clown.
The Britten/Broadhurst translation is so unfailingly good that I hope to
return just to catch more of its passing felicities. It has only one tiny
bit of translationese ('no tank from the window came down'). The way it
never goes in for smart-alec rhymestering is part of its stylishness. And it
misses only one target. Surely the modern Elvira does not join a convent?
She joins a women's group, or becomes a lesbian, or starts a Ph. D. on the
phallocentricity of Eurocentric culture.
Last week you could also catch a more conventional Don Giovanni - period
togs and all - at the Hackney Empire. The thrill here was hearing how well
this theatre suits Mozart. Sitting way back, I loved both the ease with
which the voices projected through the packed house and the absorption with
which a largely Eastender audience followed most of the show. The company
was Opera Box; its singers offer no new treats to those who know this opera,
and the cast veered away from Fraser Goulding's baton too often. But this
beautiful Matcham Theatre is the best venue for Mozart in London I have
discovered. How appalling to find that it is battling for its continued
existence.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Business and the Environment: Exploiting the rainforest -
Local indians, oilmen and conservationists have formed an uneasy alliance in
Ecuador
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Down in the Oriente, Ecuador's Amazon rainforest, US oilmen and local
indians have decided to put aside their differences and enter into a
controversial partnership aimed at exploiting the environment without
destroying it.
After years of intense battling between oil companies, conservationists, the
Ecuadorian government and indigenous groups, Maxus Energy, a US oil company,
has been given final authorisation to develop block 16, a 200,000-hectare
government concession in the Oriente.
The reason for this controversy is that part of the Maxus concession lies in
Yasuni national park, one of the most pristine and biologically diverse
areas left in the Amazon forest. Also, block 16 is in the territory of the
Huaorani indians, one of the few tribes left in Amazonia living in relative
seclusion from the industrialised world. The park has been declared an
international biosphere reserve by Unesco.
The government's permission to build an access road and oil pipeline through
the rainforest is part of a new policy which seeks to exploit natural
resources even in protected areas, an activity permitted by Ecuadorian law.
The authorisation was one of the last hurdles for the consortium headed by
Dallas-based Maxus to overcome. Conoco, which originally headed the
consortium and conducted exploratory work, abandoned the field last year
because of government indecision, opposition by conservationists and fresh
opportunities elsewhere.
One driving force behind the environmental lobby, besides the area's
ecological and tribal importance, was the knowledge that oil companies
operating in the Oriente had previously caused enormous destruction and
distrust. A report co-authored by the National Resource Defence Council in
Washington DC documented the extent of river and soil pollution, excess
deforestation and catastrophic health effects on the indigenous people in
the Oriente. According to government estimates, up to 4,200 gallons of oil
per day are discharged into the environment, equalling 19m gallons in the
past two decades.
Against this background and under the requirements of a new federal law on
oil operations, Maxus proposed an environmental plan which it argued would
minimise the negative impact on the environment and the local people and
serve as a model project for rainforest areas.
By reducing the width of the access road from 100m to 25m, including a
subterranean pipeline, and using more synthetic materials and fewer tree
trunks for the road base, Maxus claims the usual deforestation rate for such
roads has been reduced sharply. It plans to minimise deforestation further
by using clustered well sites rather than having a separate site and road
for each individual well. A reforestation project is under way - seedlings
are being cultivated to replace the trees cut down.
A significant previous concern had been that oil companies moving into the
Amazon forest opened the way for settlers, who multiplied the deforestation
rate by slash-and-burn horticulture. Maxus plans to install guarded control
posts along access roads and river crossings to prevent settlers entering
the area.
However, until Maxus has had time to comply fully with the plan,
environmentalists will remain distrustful, remembering years of oil company
abuses in the rainforest. Also, questions remain over the long-term impact.
Will the pipeline have enough safety valves to minimise the repercussions of
a possible oil spill? Is a complete regeneration of the forest area
possible? Can the habitat of rare and endangered species be regenerated?
The local environmental group, Accion Ecologica, argues that the effect of
machinery noise and deforestation on many species that require specific
breeding grounds is unknown. Yet more mainstream conservationists, while
also opposed to the project, are trying to minimise the impact of the oil
operations by participating in the process.
'Seeing that the decision to exploit oil in block 16 has been taken, we are
now working to make the project as environmentally sustainable as possible,'
says Danila Silva of EcoCiencia, an environmental research group.
Maxus has overcome previous opposition to the project by some of the
indigenous groups whose livelihood depends on the forest. Through direct
negotiations between Maxus and certain groups of the Huaorani indians, both
sides have avoided political intermediaries and come to a working agreement.
Maxus will provide community services and infrastructure to the Huaoranis.
It will also limit helicopter flights over the area to avoid disturbing
wildlife, and prohibit employees from bringing in alcohol or pornographic
material.
Having experienced the first Maxus community projects, many Huaoranis see a
chance to benefit from the venture while preserving their culture. 'The way
to protect our way of life and our culture is by reinforcing our historical
awareness, our language and our customs,' says Enqueri, a Huaorani leader.
'Through the schools and health centres that Maxus builds, we have this
opportunity.'
However, further east, the Tagaeri tribe, which retains its semi-nomadic
existence and has refused attempts at contact, remains hostile to oil
companies and all development efforts.
For the more acculturated Huaoranis, the contingency plan developed in case
of an oil spill, says Enqueri, is to go en masse to the Maxus headquarters
to denounce their agreement with the company.
Of the Dollars 752m (Pounds 530m) that Maxus will invest in block 16, about
Dollars 50m is earmarked for environmental protection measures, says Boris
Abad, its government relations official. The government is investing 57 per
cent of the project's total cost, estimated at Dollars 2.2bn. Maxus expects
to produce 220m barrels of heavy crude over the next 20 years.
The initiative shown by Maxus so far in protecting the environment and
indigenous communities in block 16 is an improvement over previous oil
ventures in the Oriente. Yet whether it can be called a model environmental
operation in the rainforest will depend on an assessment of the area in a
decade.

Good news about the trade in endangered species is rare, especially when it
comes from Paraguay, where the illegal trade in live animals, birds and
skins flourished for decades.
During the 35-year regime of General Alfredo Stroessner, corruption and
contraband were central to Paraguay's political system. Paraguayans hunted
down caymans in wildlife refuges by the hundreds of thousands to sell their
skins.
The capital, Asuncion, became a centre of the shady international trade in
live parrots, snakes and monkeys, though it was banned under Paraguayan law
and international treaties. What is more, the smugglers moved in the same
underworld as gun-runners, drug traders and car thieves.
But in 1989, a military coup toppled Stroessner and Paraguay began making
rapid, if uncertain, strides towards democracy. The government is anxious to
improve Paraguay's dreadful image by taking action over human rights
violations, corruption, smuggling and the illegal trade in animals.
During the last 18 months, Paraguay has sharpened its environmental laws and
promoted determined, honest individuals. The result is more seizures of
skins and live animals that were once openly traded. Rich and powerful
merchants find their links to the military no longer provide immunity.
Even the Swiss-based United Nations' Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (Cites), once a bitter critic, now recognises Paraguay is
improving. Obdulio Menghi, Cites' scientific co-ordinator, says the
Paraguayans 'are working like never before, because of the professional and
political (commitment) that the country has assumed for the first time'.
Change has come almost entirely as a result of intense international
pressure from groups such as Cites. Luz Aquino-Shuster, head of the
government's Cites liaison office, says: 'When I went to conferences, I
would be pointed at and people would say Paraguay is a bad country. It was
terrible.' Now, she gets letters of support. Moreover, she says: 'Biologists
are in charge now. This is important, because before the politicians were in
charge and they did not care.'
The US Fish and Wildlife Service is advising the government on improving
controls, a further sign that Paraguay's search for respectability is
something more than a public relations stunt. However, the Paraguayans have
little hard data to show for their work, although they do provide some
graphic accounts of their seizures.
For instance, in February, Aquino's staff seized 1,125 skins, coats, belts
and shoes from a trader. They also fined a shop selling illegal furs and
skins Dollars 37,500 (Pounds 26,600) - a princely sum by local standards.
Since then, traders have become warier and seizures less frequent.
Furthermore, some foreign governments caution that Paraguay's improvement is
overrated, warning that corruption and smuggling still continue, if only
with greater discretion.
Nonetheless, the government is co-ordinating wildlife control operations
with the army, police and customs, since the trade in animals is part of a
wider underground market in drugs, arms and stolen cars. It is also
sponsoring an environmental law in congress and Aquino hopes that smuggling
animals - at present a civil offence - will be made criminal.
Falling international prices have made her work easier. Hunters have glutted
the market and demand in once lucrative Asian markets is declining.
Warehouses around the world are stacked with enough cayman, iguana and boa
constrictor skins to last many years.
There is still a lot to be done. Menghi says: 'You have to struggle
permanently against contraband, whether of animals, drugs or arms.' And
several important European markets are still importing animals and skins, to
the Paraguayans' fury.
Clamping down on smuggling hits peasants and Indians, who are used to
supplementing their incomes with hunting. Experienced hunters can easily
catch a pair of adult parrots or shoot between 15 and 20 caymans a day,
although they are paid very little. It is the middlemen who reap the
profits: a parrot can retail for up to Dollars 10,000 in Los Angeles.
The government is trying to ease this problem by allowing controlled exports
of a few species whose numbers are not in danger. The main candidate for
'rational exploitation' is the heavily hunted Teyu Guazu iguana, whose skin
is used to make handbags, belts and cowboy boots. In 1980-85, between 1.5m
and 3.6m Teyu Guazu were exported.
Closer co-operation is needed at regional level. Paraguay's neighbour,
Argentina, is often criticised for lax controls and its security and
conservation forces lack co-ordination. Smugglers habitually exploit its
generous export licences to 'launder' species hunted in Bolivia, Brazil and
Paraguay. However, Menghi says even Argentina is improving its controls.
However praiseworthy these efforts may be, they do little to alleviate the
destruction of habitats, the principal threat to wildlife. The situation is
worsening by the day, as Paraguay's forests are cut down and farmers
encroach on virgin territory.

FT  03 MAR 93 / People: Ambrose to mine cabinet efficiency
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Less than three years ago 30-year-old David Ambrose was running one of Lord
Hanson's quarries in the heart of Shropshire. Now he has been packed off to
help Sir Peter Levene, the prime minister's adviser on efficiency, teach
government departments how to get value for money from the resources they
use.
Ambrose, who has a doctorate in mining engineering from Nottingham
University, has been seconded for two years to the cabinet office's
efficiency unit. He only joined Hanson in January 1991 but managed to catch
the chairman's eye at an early stage in his career.
In 1991 Lord Hanson awarded him his annual Hanson Achiever Award as a result
of his 'superior management qualities and the considerable cost savings,
productivity and improved efficiency he introduced'.
Before his secondment he was development manager of ARC Central, part of
Hanson's aggregates business.
Ambrose's secondment comes only a few weeks after Ian Stewart, a former
chief executive of British Ever Ready before Hanson sold it, was seconded to
the Department of Trade and Industry.

Geoff Annison, manager of St Albans JobCentre in Hertfordshire, has recently
recruited a new team to market unemployed professionals, managers and
executives to local companies.
His JobCentre, serving what was once one of the busiest commuter towns in
south-east England, estimates that 40 per cent of its claimants are
professionals and executives. Last summer the figure was 30 per cent.
An unprecedented increase in executive, management and professional
unemployment has been one of the most eye-catching features of the present
recession.
A Department of Employment study of London and the south-east published last
summer suggested 19 per cent of the unemployed had worked in professional or
managerial occupations. Nationally the figure was estimated at just over 10
per cent. Levels have gone up since then.
A growing number of organisations, in addition to self-help organisations,
are trying to rise to the need. They include:
JobCentres. Judging by the four jobs on offer at the St Albans JobCentre,
professionals and executives are not a natural target group.
However, with tough targets from the government to get their clients into
jobs, JobCentres are focusing on executives.
Annison, for example, has recruited seven new staff to service them. 'Most
employers do not naturally think of advertising for executives in a
JobCentre, so we are having actively to tell them about our clients,' he
says.
Training and Enterprise Councils. Several of the 82 Tecs in England and
Wales are introducing imaginative new schemes, most of them built on
Employment Training. This offers Pounds 10 per week on top of benefit and a
placement with an employer.
Vivien Houson, of Hitchin in Hertfordshire, is an enthusiastic participant.
After a business grounding at Merrill Lynch she set up her own marketing and
design company. It was forced to close last year after Houson had a serious
accident.
Unemployed, she was referred to a new executive programme, designed by
Hertfordshire Tec on the ET model. Called Management Link it offers three
weeks' general management training before placement with a local employer.
Houson's skills were matched by Enterprise Partnership, the training
organisation, with a structural engineering company which had a project that
it had not been able to develop.
Thirteen weeks later she was offered a full-time post - of managing director
of a new division which will exploit a new product she has developed within
the company. 'It was the matching that was so crucial and so successful,'
says Houson.
Individual consultancy. For an individual not receiving counselling as part
of a severance package, it is possible to find a consultant from about
Pounds 140 for a half day's session, according to the Institute of Personnel
Management*.
The two big dangers for individuals to avoid are wasting money on a cowboy
consultant and wasting time approaching counsellors who are only interested
in company assignments.
The IPM's consultancy service will help callers with both these problems by
checking those on its register, noting callers' requirements and providing
suitable names of consultants.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Management: Finding the right network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'UNTIL recently most managers believed that redundancy only happened to
blue-collar workers in the north,' says Nicholas Walters, senior staff tutor
at the Guildford Institute of the University of Surrey. 'Those who enjoyed
the success and financial rewards of the enterprise culture are largely
unprepared for the experience.'
Unemployment in Walters' 'patch' - the traditionally prosperous region of
south-west Surrey - has risen by more than 320 per cent since March 1990.
Many of the victims are executives.
Efforts to address their needs are being made through courses like the one
at Guildford. Another source of support can be found in the informal
networks of redundant executives springing up around the UK. Adult education
centres, universities, citizens advice bureaux, churches and public
libraries may also be able to provide the right introduction.
Executive unemployment is often masked by substantial redundancy payments.
But Walters believes that the refinement of job-finding skills is
particularly important. Structural changes in industry mean there will be
fewer jobs when the economy improves than there were at the top of the last
cycle.
Redundant executives are often well-qualified and have specialist skills,
but Walters says it is important to look out for transferable expertise.
Redundancy, he adds, can be an opportunity to overcome technophobia and to
improve language and personal financial management skills.
Philip Thomas, an out-of-work lawyer who recently completed a Guildford
course, is a firm believer in unemployed executive networks and has just
started one with fellow alumni. He thinks they can be a useful way of
developing training techniques and, ultimately, of tracking down jobs.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NOT many people can claim to have been sacked twice by the same company.
Peter Saunders, though, is one of them.
The axe first fell in 1982 when Saunders was pub information bureau manager
at Whitbread London, one of the brewing group's operating subsidiaries.
Redundancy was mercifully short lived and his career seemed to be back on
course with Berni Inns until 1990 when its then owner, Grand Metropolitan,
sold the restaurant chain to Whitbread. Whitbread subsequently decided to
run down the Berni brand, with the result that Saunders lost his job as
marketing controller last year.
Not surprisingly, he has since opted for a complete change of direction and
now runs a marketing consultancy, specialising in the food service field.
Saunders is hoping to capitalise on his commercial experience, but he has
also used his periods of unemployment and two outplacement training courses
to good effect. Conscious that only a lucky few like him are sponsored for
career counselling by their ex-employers, he has written and published a
self-tuition manual called Successful Job Hunting.
Saunders' product has been vetted by a senior UK personnel expert (chosen by
the FT). She describes it as 'easy to follow and well cross-referenced.
There is a strong personal touch. I wouldn't agree with everything in it but
the important thing is it's positive.'
She suggests the manual is most suitable for those up to and including
middle managers and could be valuable for anyone who has been out of the
employment market for a long time.
Saunders is offering the manual* to FT readers at a special mail order price
of Pounds 24.50.

MOST self-help manuals for the unemployed advise against developing an
interest into a job.
But that is exactly what Peter Bradley, a former Bradford-based accountant
and amateur bird watcher, has done. Today, aged 33, he is a warden, employed
by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, at Surlingham and Rockland
Reserves on the Norfolk Broads.
'Wonderful' is how he describes his new job. 'I was always keen on natural
history but my parents gave me presents like microscopes and chemistry
sets,' he says. 'But at the age of 10 one of my favourite projects was how I
would design a zoo.'
He embarked on a professional life and after completing his degree at Kent
University spent six years as a part-qualified accountant before becoming
unemployed. He then considered the different sorts of jobs he would like to
explore. Working outdoors was top of the list.
'I was pulled in by the JobCentre and told that I was an accountant and that
there were plenty of jobs in accountancy,' he says. 'But I persuaded them
that what I really wanted to do was work in nature conservation.'
He was successful in his plea and took up a training place in Snowdonia,
Wales, on Employment Training, the government programme for the adult
unemployed. 'I had a fantastic year, learning things like building dry stone
walls,' he says.
The RSPB traditionally offers short-term contracts before promoting
individuals to be wardens. Bradley took a number of these before gaining his
present job.
He says if he had remained in accountancy he could be earning twice his
current salary. But he has no regrets. 'This is where the action is. We are
turning 300 acres of derelict marshland back into a flower-rich reed fen.'

FT  03 MAR 93 / People: Lees to save domestic energy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Eoin Lees, head of the Energy Technology Support Unit at Harwell, the Atomic
Energy Authority's research laboratories, has been appointed the first chief
executive of the Energy Saving Trust.
Lees, 45, a nuclear physicist, has run ETSU for five of his 17 years at
Harwell. ETSU, which carries out projects for industrial and business
customers, has also worked recently for the Energy Efficiency Office, part
of the environment department.
The Energy Saving Trust, which has been one of the main planks of the
government's environmental policy, has been criticised for its slow start
since Michael Howard, environment secretary, announced its creation last
summer. Headed by Lord John Moore, the former cabinet minister, it is
intended to encourage the gas and electricity utilities to help households
save energy. But critics have been concerned that the utilities would be
reluctant to back moves that could damage their revenue, and would seek to
pass much of the costs on to customers.
However, Lees, who takes up his post on April 5, says: 'I feel strongly that
we can make a convincing case that the trust represents the first real
chance to tackle the problems of energy inefficiency in the domestic
sector.'

Mike Knowles (right), who started his City career as a foreign exchange
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo nearly 30 years ago, has come out of
semi-retirement to take on the chairmanship of M W Marshall, one of the
world's biggest foreign exchange brokers.
Knowles, 50, has been assoc-iated with Marshalls since 1965 but retired
shortly after the Pounds 175m management buy-out from British &amp; Commonwealth
in February 1989. Although he is no longer involved in the day-to-day
management of Marshalls, he has remained a director of Marshalls Finance,
the holding company for the management buy-out.
He says that he was invited to return full-time to Marshalls after it was
decided to split Chris Kelson's role as chairman and chief executive.
Knowles says that the buy-out has gone 'very well' and the decision to split
Kelson's dual function was merely a reflection of current trends in
corp-orate governance.
Kelson remains chief executive and Tony Porter, head of Marshall's European
division, has been appointed managing director.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Management: Calling on volunteers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUNDANCY is a time for feeling sorry for yourself. Perhaps this state of
mind helps explain why many redundant managers finish up feeling sorry for
others as well, decide they want to 'do something useful' with their lives
and consider working for a charity.
There are other motivating factors. A redundancy payment might make it
possible for a manager to take a lower-paid post. Although many big
charities pay better than they once did, the voluntary sector does not
generate lavish incomes.
Neither is it a soft option. Many charities are facing the same recessionary
pressures as the private sector. Some are having to make staff redundant and
those that are recruiting demand commitment and hard work. However,
opportunities do exist. Around one-third of voluntary-sector managers are
drawn from commercial organisations, so the right type of person will not
find a culture of resistance to outside recruitment.
Who is the right type of person? The voluntary sector is not a quiet
backwater - it turns over around 4 per cent of GDP. Big charities need much
the same range of finance, marketing, personnel and other specialist skills
as private companies.
But many have day-to-day contact with voluntary workers and are run in a
more open, committee-structured way than commercial organisations. Managers
who incline to a participative, decision-making style are more likely to
settle into this atmosphere than those who draw comfort from giving and
receiving orders.
Expertise in a charity's area of activities or previous involvement with the
voluntary sector can help. For anyone contemplating an eventual
career-switch to a charity, this can be gained from voluntary work. The
Volunteer Centre UK* is a national charity that exists to promote
volunteering.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Jobs: How to minimise an uninsured liability - Evidence that
sound selection tests can pay dividends even at basic levels of employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINDING a note on the desk to return Ken Miller's call, the Jobs column
followed the scribbled instructions, got though and arranged to visit his
house. He then gave the address, but hearing I planned to go by rail,
offered to pick me up by car if I phoned him from the station. So I thanked
him, and asked for his telephone number.
'You're calling me on it,' said Dr Miller, an internationally esteemed
tester of intelligence.
His voice took on the same pointed tone again when I rang on the due date
itself to say that, having come by car instead, I couldn't find his house.
It turned out that I'd arrived in a road with the right name, but located in
entirely the wrong area.
He nevertheless agreed to stay waiting, probably because I wasn't going
there for a by then superfluous assessment of my intelligence. The purpose
of my visit was to take one of the many other kinds of test administered
from the same household - not just by Ken, but by Mrs Miller better known by
her professional name of Barbara Tyler.
The test in question is the Work Attitude Scale which, although popular with
employers in the Millers' native Australia, is little known in Europe. Hence
their idea of inviting this Pom to come and have a shot at it.
Consisting of just 44 questions to be answered by ticking either 'yes' or
'no', it is normally completed within 10 minutes. But on being left alone to
make my attempt, I ran into difficulties on only the second question, which
asked: 'Do you find yourself at times full of energy and at others find it
hard to get going?'
What stumped me was not the bit about finding myself at times full of
energy, which I sometimes do despite usually feeling quite the opposite. The
trouble is that even when at my most energetic, I still find it hard to get
going. So I went and explained the problem to Ken Miller, who studied me in
silence for several seconds before saying the safest advice he could give
was to answer 'no'.
Fortunately, things went well enough thereafter for me to finish the form
just over 15 minutes after starting. But since it then took the good doctor
a good deal less time to to score my efforts and hand down his verdict, I
was surprised as well as pleased to come out pretty well.
In exploring people's attitude to work, the test measures three different
aspects of character. And the first of them, technically termed service
orientation, is essentially how we get on with our fellow humans.
Barbara Tyler was swift to emphasise that there are no hard and fast rules
for deciding the right degree of sociability for jobs in general. A score on
the stand-offish side could be a plus in work that requires distanced
judgment. On the other hand, staff continually badgered by not always
sympathetic people might do well to be more than usually gregarious. In the
main, though, a score somewhere between the two will be preferable.
The next measure, which the test calls task focus, is of how far we accord
with Ecclesiastes 9,10: 'Whatsoever they hand findeth to do, do it with thy
might . . . .' But while staff who take personal pride in their accuracy and
high productiveness are obviously more desirable than skimpers, those who
elevate pride in the job to outright perfectionism tend to be handicaps.
Measure number three, termed work approach, is of the extent to which we
characteristically take responsibility for the tasks entrusted to us. Here
again the right degree will be determined by what is appropriate for the
particular setting. Even so, since responsibility-addicts are apt to be
bloody-minded, and their extreme opposites are averse to doing anything
unless issued with detailed instructions, the best bet is once more a score
in the mid-range.
So how did the Jobs column rate on the three yardsticks?
Well, for the benefit of any readers who happen to be top executives and in
the market, Here is the snapshot of me that would be handed to an employing
outfit's chieftains:
Service orientation - A bit too open and easy-going.
Task focus - Takes pride in doing a good job.
Work approach - Accepts responsibility.
Hence, in the latter two, the test scored me squarely in the desirable
mid-range. Moreover, while on the over-sociable side, I am only slightly so.
Alas I wasn't left preening myself for long before Barbara Tyler brought the
chickens home to roost with a vengeance.
'Of course, those results say nothing about your ability for higher-level
work such as managing and the professions,' she said sweetly. 'That's not
what the process is designed to assess. All that it reflects is fitness for
basic jobs - shopfloor manufacture, checking-out in supermarkets, hotel
reception, bus conducting - up to the lowest rank of supervisor, perhaps,
but not beyond it.'
At which point I would dearly like to know whether readers' instant reaction
is the same as mine was. I immediately felt myself losing all interest in
the Work Attitude Scale and its applications. But any of us who shared that
reaction should surely need only a second's thought to give us reason to
feel ashamed of our snobbish reflexes. For the fact that a job is ranked low
in a hierarchy is clearly no gauge of its importance to the employing
organisation, let alone to the welfare of humanity.
For one thing, there seems little doubt that anybody who talks of such jobs
as 'unskilled' can never have tried doing them properly. Even sweeping-up is
something that can be done either well or badly, despite being an expertise
that is most often noticed only in its absence.
For another, just as people who apply themselves cheerfully to basic work in
the spirit of Ecclesiastes are an undervalued asset, skimpers of it are an
un-insured liability. Goodness knows how much harm they collectively do to
the corporate interest. For example, if I had a fat research contract to
hand to one of the universities, a good half thereof would already have
disqualified themselves just by employing couldn't-care-less telephonists.
So it is to the credit of the Work Attitude Scale's Australian developers,
Doug Mcleod and the late Alf Chandler, that they twigged the decisiveness of
low-ranked work. And, having twigged same, they also look to have devised a
useful test of some of the necessary abilities.
True, the personality factors the WAS measures are only part of the mix
required; as Barbara Tyler says, physical looks can often be no less
important. True, too, that the Millers stand to gain from the test's wider
usage.
Even so, evidence of its value is there to be seen in before-and-after
studies of its effects in companies. Gauged by reductions in basic staff
departures both voluntary and otherwise, the improvements range from 17 to
57 per cent, with an average of 31. The testing cost of achieving them is
under Pounds 20 a candidate.
Any employer minded to use the test should nevertheless check the facts
personally. For the Jobs column, or at least its present writer, now also
has a vested interest. With retirement age looming next year, I'm glad to
have the WAS certification of qualities that should make me an almost ideal
checker-out in a supermarket - if I can only find my way to it, that is.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Concern over pension assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of 30 Labour MPs yesterday tabled an early-day motion urging British
Coal to refrain from any action relating to its pension funds until the
social services committee pensions inquiry concludes, David Owen writes.
The motion also charged Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
and Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, with incompetence in their dealings with
the mining industry.
It noted that Mr Rhoslyn Roberts, secretary of the British Coal staff
superannuation scheme, considered present safeguards to be inadequate.
Meanwhile, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday stressed to
trustees of the British Rail pension fund that the government had no 'hidden
agenda' for stripping the fund of its assets.
He said that 'irresponsible speculation' about the future of the pensions
after railway privatisation was needlessly worrying BR pensioners.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten move on school ballots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, will announce today that the
government will take new powers to overturn ballots on whether schools opt
for grant-maintained status if local auth-orities interfere in the process.
Under the proposals, ballots could be declared void where one of four types
of interference by third parties had taken place. It was not spelled out
last night who these third parties were but it was taken to be a reference
to local authorities that oppose grant-maintained schools.
Examples of interference would include the intimidation of voters and the
dissemination of seriously misleading information during the conduct of a
ballot.
Mr Patten is expected to portray the proposals as an attempt to ensure fair
play in an important aspect of local democracy.
News of the move emerged last night as Mr Patten was accused of acting like
a dictator during the first of two consecutive days' Commons debate on the
education bill.
Ms Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, charged Mr Patten with wanting 'a
national system of education under your personal political control'.
With the parliamentary guillotine in operation to ensure that MPs are asked
to give the bill a third reading by 10pm today, the government secured a
majority of 46 (284-238) to carry a new provision strengthening the
minister's powers over schools in England and Wales.
MPs may not get the chance to debate Mr Patten's proposed new measures in
full. It is understood the measures are to be inserted in the bill as an
amendment to a clause on which debate has already been curtailed.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's controversial Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill was
dented yesterday as the House of Lords insisted that the streamlining of the
asylum system should include a new safeguard for child refugees, Alison
Smith writes.
Led by Lord Brightman, a former law lord, a cross-party alliance of peers
rejected ministerial advice and voted for the setting up of a special panel
to advise young and unaccompanied refugees on a range of matters.
Lord Brightman said there should be special reception and support
arrangements for vulnerable children arriving alone in Britain. But Lord
Ferrers, Home Office minister, argued that local authorities were best
placed to look after the welfare of children.
The scale of the government defeat - by 169 votes to 114 - will make it
difficult for ministers to reverse the setback.
Earl Ferrers also categorically denied reports that ministers planned to
privatise the immigration service.
Replying to Liberal Democrat Lord Bonham-Carter, who asked him about rumours
that it would in future be run by a security firm, he said the home
secretary had never believed this work was suitable for the market outside.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd seeks EC blueprint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has set up a high-level committee to draw up a British
blueprint for reforms to European Community institutions, aimed at
consolidating and entrenching the powers and autonomy of member states.
The committee, combining Foreign Office and Cabinet Office personnel, has
been set up by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, in anticipation of the
1996 inter-governmental conference on the EC's constitutional arrangements.
It reflects Mr Hurd's growing conviction that the controversy over the
Maastricht treaty is in part the consequence of 'reactive' as opposed to
'active' diplomacy.
Mr Hurd concluded that by promoting a British vision of 'a more flexible and
decentralised Community', the Conservative party would be able to reunite
after the internal strife provoked by the treaty.
A senior official said yesterday there was widespread acknowledgement that
Britain had failed to articulate its vision of the Community early enough in
the policymaking process, fuelling the impression, he said, that 'we are
constantly being shifted by foreigners'.
Labour is to challenge the government to publish details of its regional
spending plans, in an effort to highlight the extent to which EC aid to
high-unemployment areas may be lost because of a failure by Whitehall to
provide matching funds.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A RADICAL redesign of schemes for the unemployed
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
to provide programmes combining temporary work with job-hunting - is being
planned as a response to rising unemployment.
Instead of offering simply a programme of community work - as happens under
Employment Action - or a training course, new schemes targeted at the
long-term unemployed and 18 to 24-year-olds and involving 'some element of
compulsion' would offer a mix of three days a week on such activities with
two days a week spent looking for work.
Extra impetus has been given to work on the initiative by Mr John Major's
remarks about workfare-type systems in his speech to the Carlton Club last
month. Ministers also believe there is currently a cross-party mood in
favour of ensuring that the unemployed are active, which makes it possible
to move swiftly.
An important element will be greater flexibility in meeting individual
needs, already reflected to some extent in the Training for Work scheme,
which will start from the beginning of April.
This brings Employment Action and Employment Training into a single Pounds
972m programme with 320,000 places a year, intended to enable the Tecs to
provide more individually tailored opportunities. The Tecs themselves would
welcome the sort of initiative being planned.
The programme would be announced in the December Budget and ministers
believe it could take effect quickly.
While the Tecs have assumed that they would be responsible for any new
locally managed schemes, ministers are considering whether the task should
be given to the Employment Service.
This second stage would follow the immediate moves on unemployment signalled
for the March 16 Budget.
These include a slight relaxation of the rule on the number of hours that
someone can study before becoming ineligible for unemployment benefit.
Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, has already been to the United
States to observe unemployment programmes there. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the
employment secretary, is to make a similar visit this summer.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shift in super soaraway agenda -
Why the tabloid papers have reassessed Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S THE Sun wot won it, screamed the banner headline in Britain's
bestselling tabloid after Mr John Major's election victory last year.
The message was typically immodest but not unconvincing. The Tories had run
a hopeless campaign. The Sun had rescued them with its daily vilification of
Mr Neil Kinnock's Labour party.
How times change. Earlier this week Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, the Sun's
irrepressibly flamboyant editor, hosted an intimate dinner for a select
group of senior politicians.
But the guests ushered into a private room at London's Savoy hotel were not
from the Tory cabinet he had helped re-elect.
With the government's popularity crumbling, Mr MacKenzie preferred the
company of Mr Tony Blair, Mr Gordon Brown and Ms Majorie Mowlam, the
youthful rising stars of Labour's shadow cabinet.
Yesterday he was unusually reticent about the dinner. But The Sun is far
from alone among the Tory tabloids in deciding to replace scorn for the
opposition with a new willingness to give it a fair run.
To the delight of Mr John Smith's team - and the fury of Downing Street - a
potent mix of genuine disenchantment with the Tories and crude commercial
judgment has warmed relations between Labour and its erstwhile enemies.
The recession, the bitter Tory infighting over Maastricht and Mr Kinnock's
departure have all contributed to the shift. The country is disgruntled and
no tabloid can afford to be too far out of step with its readers.
The trend has been reinforced by the fierce competition resulting from a
shrinking market - and by the opportunity to pick up Labour-supporting
readers offered by the Daily Mirror's public rift with the opposition
leadership.
A glance at the reception given earlier this week to Mr Smith's call for
constitutional reforms tells the story.
The Daily Mail declared that he planned sweeping reforms of Britain's
'crumbling' constitution. The Sun said he had dumped his party's 'Big
Brother image'. Today, another member of Mr Rupert Murdoch's Wapping stable
dubbed him 'Citizen Smith' for promising to put the individual before the
state. Those stories followed a week in which they had offered generous
praise for Mr Blair's response to the escalating juvenile crime rate.
The change reflects an informal edict to their political journalists at
Westminster: as long as the government is making a hash of things, Labour
must be given a fair run. Only the Daily Express has remained unquestionably
loyal to the Tories.
The change has been most striking at Today. Its editor, Mr Richard Stott,
this week underlined its shift to the left by appointing Mr Alastair
Campbell to oversee its political coverage.
Mr Campbell, a close personal friend of Mr Kinnock, left the Daily Mirror
only 10 days ago after a row with its chief executive. Mr Stott, once a
Mirror editor, hopes Today will be the principal beneficiary of the disarray
in the editorial offices of his former employer.
Exasperation with the government is reflected almost daily in The Sun's
editorial columns. After a recent opinion poll found that 80 per cent of the
population was unhappy with the government, the tabloid declared that the
only surprise was that as many as 20 per cent were content.
There is an important caveat to all this. It is not uncommon for the
tabloids to dilute their support for Tory governments between elections.
A lot can happen in the next four years. Few at Westminster believe that Mr
Murdoch's papers would actively support Labour when it really counts. But in
the meantime Mr Smith and his colleagues can enjoy Mr MacKenzie's claret
instead of his more familiar vitriol.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major cautious on envoy to Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major refused yesterday to rule out the possibility of a US
'fact-finding' envoy to Northern Ireland meeting representatives of Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the IRA, Ivor Owen writes.
However, he urged the Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists,
to wait and see 'what announcement is made about the fact-finder that I
believe may come from the US to Northern Ireland'.
Downing Street believes any envoy would want to spend most time with the
political parties who won most votes in elections - the non-violent Unionist
and nationalist parties, but the government would not feel embarrassed if
the envoy met organisations banned by Britain from appearing on television.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, used a speech in Belfast
last night to rebuff suggestions that the government was 'neutral' about the
province.
Ministers respected the wishes of the population when deciding whether
Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK, but Sir Patrick said: 'We are
not neutral in our resolve to protect and deliver the people of Northern
Ireland from terrorist violence.'

FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour demands aid cash details
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party is to challenge the government to publish details of its
regional spending plans. It wants to highlight how much EC aid to
high-unemployment areas may be lost because of Whitehall's failure to
provide matching funds.
The opposition intends to demand the details at Treasury question time
tomorrow, according to Ms Harriet Harman, the shadow Treasury chief
secretary. Ms Harman was in Brussels yesterday for meetings with European
Commission and parliament officials including Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner
for regional policy.
Mr Millan last week confirmed that the UK risked losing large sums of aid to
depressed regions because it was not matching EC allocations. Britain has
yet to take up a total of Ecu1.23bn (Pounds 1.02bn) in its EC regional fund
entitlement for areas in industrial decline for the 1989-93 period.
Ms Harman said: 'We want to measure (the government's) allocation against
the (EC) funds available.'
She also wrote yesterday to Mr John Major, the prime minister, calling on
him to take up an estimated extra Pounds 82m the UK should receive from the
EC social fund as a result of the devaluation of sterling. The fund is to
train the younger unemployed or those out of work for more than a year.
Unspent money in the 1989-93 EC structural aid budget will be lost if it is
not taken up by the end of this year, even though the Treasury would get
some of it back via the UK's EC budgetary rebate.
Failure to resolve the 'matching' finance dispute with Brussels could affect
the UK's ability to take up its share of the much greater regional funds it
looks set to receive under the 1994-99 programme worth Ecu156bn.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Blueprint for EC reforms sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has set up a high-level committee to draw up a British
blueprint for reforms to European Community institutions, aimed at
consolidating and entrenching the powers and autonomy of member states.
The committee, combining Foreign Office and Cabinet Office personnel, has
been set up by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, in anticipation of the
1996 inter-governmental conference on the EC's constitutional arrangements.
It reflects Mr Hurd's growing conviction that the controversy over the
Maastricht treaty is in part the consequence of reactive as opposed to
'active diplomacy'.
Mr Hurd concluded that by promoting a British vision of 'a more flexible and
decentralised Community', the Conservative party would be able to reunite
after the internal strife provoked by the treaty.
A senior official said yesterday there was widespread acknowledgement in
government circles that Britain had failed to articulate its vision of the
Community early enough in the policymaking process, fuelling the impression,
he said, that 'we are constantly being shifted by foreigners'.
He added: 'The last IGC was conducted on other people's terms. We want to be
on the front foot from the outset.'
The European Policy Group, a market-oriented, London-based think tank, is
engaged in a similar initiative. It is acting as the secretariat to a group
of economists and constitutional specialists drawn from right-wing and
Christian Democrat opinion across Europe.
Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Group, described its work
as a 'fightback' by those who believed in positive engagement in EC affairs
but opposed the 'centralising' tendencies of the European establishment.
Among the ideas under consideration is a possible role for national
politicians in a second chamber of the European parliament.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 100 farmers are to share about Pounds 600,000 in extra
compensation for the compulsory slaughter of their poultry flocks in 1988.
The slaughter was demanded after fears that eggs were contaminated with
salmonella.
The compensation comes after a report from the parliamentary ombudsman
criticised the Ministry of Agriculture over its failure to 'devise and
implement a scheme which complied with the legislation' to pay compensation.
Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, said the decision to discount the
value of slaughtered flocks by 40 per cent to reflect the taint of
salmonella infection was 'incorrect'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S gold and foreign currency reserves fell by an underlying Dollars
59m in February, the Treasury reported yesterday, Emma Tucker writes.
The overall rise in reserves, however, was Dollars 896m, boosted by extra
borrowing. Most of the increase came from the proceeds of the fourth tender
of three-year Ecu Treasury notes, which amounted to Dollars 622m. There was
also a Pounds 409m difference between Ecu Treasury bills maturing and Ecu
Treasury bill proceeds. These factors were excluded from the underlying
change.
At the end of last month the official reserves stood at Dollars 43.4bn
compared with Dollars 42.55bn at the end of January.

FT  03 MAR 93 / City seen as undamaged by ERM exit: Eddie George, incoming
Bank of England governor, is blunt about budget deficit but buoyant about
City's standing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S departure from the European exchange rate mechanism will not
damage the City of London's standing as an international financial centre,
Mr Eddie George, the incoming governor of the Bank of England, said
yesterday in Tokyo.
Mr George told executives from leading Japanese financial institutions that
doubts about the City's standing and the UK's commitment to European
economic integration were misplaced.
Mr George was responding to concerns that heavy Japanese manufacturing and
financial investment in the UK might be damaged if sterling's exit from the
ERM had the result of confining Britain to the sidelines of the European
market.
He told a seminar organised by British Invisibles, the export promotion body
for services, that the City's position depended on the completion of the
single market rather than monetary integration.
He said: 'Monetary integration is less critical than the single market to
London's position, which has not depended upon the currency in which
business is conducted and has not depended upon the posi-tion of the
national curren-cy.'
He said Britain would have plunged into a still deeper recession had it
remained within the ERM at the cost of keeping interest rates high.
In spite of signs of an easing of German interest rate policy, Mr George
said: 'The divergences between the domestic policy needs in Germany and in
the UK seem likely to persist for some time to come, and partly for that
reason it is unlikely that the UK will re-enter the ERM for some time.'
Even outside the exchange rate mechanism, the Maastricht treaty's
convergence criteria for monetary union would help guide British policy. Mr
George said Britain would be as likely to satisfy the Maastricht convergence
criteria as most other EC countries.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Deficit 'will outlast recession': Eddie George, incoming

City's standing
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is likely to face a sizeable underlying budget deficit even after
its economy recovers from the recession, Mr Eddie George, the incoming
governor of the Bank of England, warned yesterday in Tokyo.
Mr George said the government would have to address the structural deficit.
The only question was whether it did so immediately, with the economy still
fragile, or waited until recovery was under way.
Mr George, the central bank's deputy governor, will take over from Mr Robin
Leigh-Pemberton in July.
His remarks confirm the Bank's view that the government will have to embark
on a sustained programme of fiscal consolidation even if recent cuts in
interest rates and the depreciation of sterling spark a strong recovery.
In the first 10 months of the current financial year, the budget deficit
stood at Pounds 21.6bn compared with a surplus of Pounds 14.7bn in the whole
of 1988-89. Some City analysts believe the deficit could rise to more than
10 per cent of gross domestic production within five years.
Mr George, speaking before giving a lecture in Tokyo, said: 'I suspect a
substantial underlying deficit will emerge which the government will, in
time, have to address. The question is whether it addresses it now when the
economy is still fragile or later when the economy is stronger.'
He said it was difficult to establish how much of Britain's growing deficit
was due to the recession, which has pushed up social security and
unemployment spending, and how much to a structural deterioration in
government finances.
Mr George said a large part of the deficit, which reflected the recession,
would disappear once the economy recovered.
He added: 'The conditions are in place for that and the deficit should
diminish of its own accord.'
Britain would start from a strong position, with a relatively light rate of
indebtedness as a proportion of gross domestic product, which meant that it
could be in a better position than most European countries to meet the
Maastricht convergence criterion for economic and monetary union.
The British economy had never been more competitive, Mr George said. The
task ahead was to maintain the competitive advantage provided by sterling's
recent devaluation.
He said British costs were the lowest by international standards that he
could remember for 25 years. He expected sterling to appreciate gradually as
other countries reduced interest rates.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Gas-fired station may be delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, DAVID OWEN and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is considering delaying for two years the construction of a
Pounds 2bn gas-fired power station at Connah's Quay, Clwyd. The delay would
jeopardise the development of four offshore oil and gas fields which are to
supply the station.
Any move against gas would spark a storm of protest and possibly legal
actions against the government, which has previously shown strong support
for diversification out of coal-fired electricity.
The government is struggling to find a way of preserving enough of the 31
threatened coal mines to satisfy backbenchers. Difficulties in negotiations
with the main power generators appear to have prompted Mr Michael Heseltine,
the trade and industry secretary, to reassess previously rejected options
for expanding the market for domestic coal.
These include restricting the operation of new gas-fired power stations and
tinkering with arrangements under which Britain imports nuclear-generated
electricity from France.
The government's problems have delayed publication of a white paper on the
subject, which was originally due to appear last month. The cabinet
committee dealing with coal is understood not to be meeting for the time
being. Whitehall sources say the government has decided that it will allow
PowerGen, the electricity generator, to go ahead with the Connah's Quay
project. But it may want a two-year delay in construction, initially planned
to start this year.
This would mean that the plant would start producing electricity in 1998,
when the coal contracts now under discussion expire. Connah's Quay will have
the capacity to produce 1,350 MW, the equivalent of 4m tonnes of coal a
year.
PowerGen has told the government that a delay would be unacceptable to it
and to Hamilton Oil and Gas, Monument and Lasmo, developers of the Liverpool
Bay oil and gas field which will supply Connah's Quay.
Mr Charles Howson, external affairs manager at Hamilton, said a two-year
delay could 'jeopardise the whole economics of the project'.
The project's partners have invested more than Pounds 70m in preparing for
development of the offshore fields. The project would create some 4,000 jobs
in the depressed north Wales area. Mr Tony Craven-Walker, managing director
of Monument, said government interference in the project would place a
question mark over the economics of oil and gas investment in the UK.
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, has promised to raise the matter with Mr
Heseltine following repeated requests from Mr Barry Porter, Tory MP for
Wirral South.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Top 3i executive assures on policy after flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF executive of 3i, the UK's biggest venture capital group, sought
yesterday to reassure investee companies (companies in which 3i has taken an
equity stake) that a possible Stock Exchange flotation for 3i would not
threaten their future wellbeing.
Addressing the first meeting of the 3i Communication Club, an independent
organisation formed to represent investee companies' interests, Mr Ewen
Macpherson said flotation would not change 3i's policy of long-term
investment.
He told representatives of 50 3i investee companies in Newcastle upon Tyne
that a review was imminent of 3i's possible flotation, postponed further
last year because of the recession. Should 3i decide to float, he said, it
would be as an investment trust, the success of which would be measured
partly by long-term growth. No pressure would be placed on investee
companies to increase their dividend payments.
Mr Macpherson will today address a similar 3i Communication Club meeting in
Birmingham, and tomorrow in London. In total, representatives of around 450
3i investee companies are expected to attend the meetings. The formation of
the club last November was prompted by fears that flotation would induce an
attitude of short termism by 3i towards its investments. There was also
criticism of alleged lack of communication by 3i, and calls for preferential
treatment for client companies in any 3i share issue.
Asked yesterday who would benefit from flotation, Mr Macpherson said he
expected some of the funds raised, should it proceed, would go to 3i's main
shareholders, the clearing banks. He hoped some proceeds would be ploughed
back into 3i.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Bottomley defends hospital reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRITICS who believed the problems of London's hospitals had been caused by
the government's internal market in healthcare were 'wrong by about 100
years', Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday.
The problems, she told the Commons health committee, were long-standing and
had been the subject of more reports than virtually any other issue. But she
accepted that they had been brought to a head by the government's 1991
National Health Service reforms, which had changed from an
institution-focused structure to a patient-focused one.
'Under those circumstances, it was inevitable that the institution-dominated
health service in London would soon come under fierce scrutiny and face
mounting pressure to change,' she said.
Mrs Bottomley added that it was important to look beyond the pleading of
individual cases and address the concerns of doctors and other professionals
about the 'mounting inadequacy' of the NHS to meet modern needs in London.
'We must live up to the expectations of those who embrace, welcome and want
change in the capital. This will mean swift action carried forward according
to a tight timetable.'
Mr Tim Chessells, chairman of the implementation group overseeing the London
changes, said approaches had been received from other English regions about
the possibility of relocating London specialist units elsewhere.
The British Medical Association is telling its members to seek local-level
recognition in trust hospitals in readiness for an expected shift from
national bargaining on doctors' conditions of service.
By next year almost all hospitals and community health services will have
become locally managed trusts. Although staff transfer to trusts on existing
national terms of employment, trust managements can seek to negotiate
changes in them.
BMA leaders accept that this will lead to a gradual end to the current
national structure under which hospital and community doctors enjoy the same
pay and conditions wherever they work. There will be a particular incentive
for some trust managements to introduce new contracts for doctors in the
hope of encouraging consultants to treat private patients on trust premises
rather than in independent hospitals.
Some trust managements are examining ways of streamlining collective
bargaining, while the BMA is anxious to ensure that medical staff retain
flexibility to negotiate independently on issues exclusive to the
profession. It has set up a network of local negotiating committees to
represent medical staff in almost all existing and potential trusts.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Nissan told to pay past importer Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese motor manufacturer, was yesterday ordered to pay Pounds
6m to Nissan UK, its former British importer, for not honouring an agreement
to provide marketing support for sales of its range of Bluebird cars.
The Pounds 6m payment had been negotiated by Mr Octav Botnar, chairman of
Nissan UK, as an incentive for taking 12,700 of the cars in the six months
before they went out of production in 1990, the vice-chancellor, Sir Donald
Nicholls, said in the High Court.
Nissan had denied such an agreement had ever been reached. However, Sir

FT  03 MAR 93 / PM hints at small-business aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday offered a broad hint that small businesses will be
among the main beneficiaries of any tax concessions in the March 16 Budget.
Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister agreed to pass on to Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, a call from a backbench Tory MP for the Treasury to
recognise that small businesses offered the best hope of renewed job
creation.
His response was technically noncommittal, but Mr Major's supportive tone
reinforced expectations among the government's supporters that a promised
'Budget for jobs' will concentrate on measures to encourage the creation and
expansion of small companies.
Tory MPs believe Mr Lamont will increase personal taxes through an extension
of the value added tax net.
But they think that he will then use some of the additional revenue to
promote investment, exports and employment.
Last month the Confederation of British Industry tabled a 10-point plan for
small business which it said could be implemented within the tight
constraints imposed by a soaring public sector borrowing requirement.
It is understood that the CBI was encouraged to make its submission during
earlier informal contacts with Whitehall.
Mr Howard Davies, the director-general of the employers' organisation, is a
frequent visitor to 10 Downing Street.
Among the CBI recommendations were larger capital allowances, higher
corporation tax thresholds, new exemptions from capital gains tax and
measures to improve the availability of equity finance for small businesses.
The package would cost about Pounds 500m in the first year, although that
would rise to closer to Pounds 1bn in later years.
Mr Lamont is also under pressure from the Conservative back benches to relax
further the rules on inheritance tax and raise significantly the VAT
threshold.
In parallel Tory MPs have been lobbying for a reduction in the uniform
business rate as the most effective way to ease the financial pressures on
small businesses in the south and south-east.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Employers cut cash for pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of British employers are using pension fund surpluses to
reduce or eliminate their contributions to employee pension schemes, the
National Association of Pension Funds has found.
In its 1992 survey of pension schemes, the association found that 38 per
cent of employers are making no contribution while another 16 per cent are
making reduced contributions. A further 1 per cent have used scheme
surpluses to refund cash to themselves.
The figures show a rise from the 1991 survey when 47 per cent of schemes
were on full or partial contributions holiday.
Mr Mike Brown, the association's director of information, said the rise in
contributions holidays showed the effects the recession was having on
employers. 'They would rather use the money to pay their suppliers and
staff,' he said.
The question of whether employers should have the exclusive right to use
scheme surpluses is among the most contentious issues under review by a
government panel headed by Professor Roy Goode.
The survey did not ask respondents whether contributions holidays have been
accompanied by benefit improvements for scheme members. It covered 852
association members, covering roughly 40 per cent of all UK pension scheme
members.
Last year 19 per cent of employees eligible to join a scheme chose not to do
so, compared with 16 per cent in 1991. Mr Brown said there may have been
reasons other than disenchantment with occupational schemes which might
account for the figure, such as the inclusion of part-time workers who may
feel their earnings are too low to afford contributions.
The survey also found no sign of a much-touted trend suggesting that
employers are abandoning final-salary schemes in favor of money-purchase
schemes. Mr Brown said: 'It's the sort of thing many people are talking
about but very few are actually doing it.' Employers have threatened that,
if the government imposes new regulations on occupational schemes, they will
abandon them in favour of money-purchase schemes.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Cable TV plan by US companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COX CABLE Communications and Southwestern Bell, two US telecom companies,
yesterday unveiled a preliminary agreement to buy and operate cable
television and telephone systems in the UK.
Under the terms of the joint venture, due to be finalised in early April,
Cox Cable, based in Atlanta, will take an initial 25 per cent stake in
Southwestern Bell's eight UK cable television and telephony franchises
covering 1.25m homes in the north-west and Midlands.
Both declined to give financial details. Industry analysts believe the joint
venture will see Cox investing about Dollars 300m (Pounds 211.2m) in
Southwestern's UK cable operations.
The deal is further confirmation of strong north American interest in the
developing UK cable telecommunications sector.
Mr James Robbins, president of Cox Cable, said the joint venture was
inspired by a shared belief that the UK 'is the freest competitive
telecommunications marketplace in the world today.'
Mr Michael Turner, president of Southwestern Bell International Holdings,
said the joint venture this year will spend in the region of Pounds 48m,
laying cable to about 160,000 homes in its current UK franchises.
The latest official statistics from the Independent Television Commission,
the regulatory body for all commercial television, show that 440,162 homes
were connected to modern broadband cable networks by January this year, up
from 268,812 in January 1992. The UK has 58 cable operating franchises.
According to Mr Richard Woollam, director-general of the UK's Cable
Television Association, cable television will grow by at least 60 per cent
this year with 300,000 new subscribers.
Several other US cable operators are understood to be considering investing
in UK cable, including Times Mirror, Century Communications, Cablevision
Industries and Continental Cablevision.
In mid-February Southwestern Bell, based in Texas, agreed to buy two cable
television systems in Washington DC for Dollars 650m.
That deal has yet to be approved by the US Justice department and the
Federal Communications Commission. It also has cable interests in Israel.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Judge tells BSB to pay Philips damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH Court judge yesterday ruled that British Satellite Broadcasting was
in breach of a contract with Philips Electronics when it merged with Sky
Television in November 1990.
Mr Justice Tuckey said the merger in effect destroyed the market for
BSB-receiving equipment.
The Dutch group had signed a contract in 1989 obliging Philips to develop,
manufacture and deliver receivers for satellite television reception until
the end of 1992. The judge held there was an implied term in the contract
that BSB would do nothing to destroy the market for Philips' products.
Damages are to be assessed later.
BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant
stake, said it would appeal.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Wyatt calls for list of freelance BBC executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILL WYATT, managing director of BBC Network Television, has called for a
list of BBC executives who are freelances, whether or not they have their
own private companies. The action follows the revelation that Mr John Birt,
BBC director-general, was a freelance consultant from the time he joined the
BBC six years ago until Monday, when he applied to join the staff.
Bectu, the broadcasting union, will ask BBC management for a list of private
companies operating within the corporation. Even senior BBC executives do
not know how many executives are not on the staff. Virtually all members of
the drama department have been freelance for many years.
Apart from some executives of London Weekend Television, private companies
for broadcasting staff seem to be rare.
Mr Vernon Lawrence, former head of drama at Yorkshire Television and now
head of drama and entertainment at the ITV network, explained yesterday why
he went on Yorkshire's staff when he became a department head.
'When you have a company car and a company TV and a company video, how can
you be anything else but an employee?' Mr Lawrence asked. 'I've paid through
the nose but I can sleep in my bed at night.'
Mr Marcus Plantin, the ITV network director who had a private company when
he was at LWT, declined to discuss whether he was now paid through a private
company.
Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, said yesterday he was concerned at the
'dual standards ' involved in the Birt case. The BBC had become increasingly
strict about who it accepted as a freelance. Mr Lennon said that even
categories of production worker recognised by the Revenue as freelance had
tax deducted under pay-as-you-earn.
Mr Andy Egan, Bectu's tax specialist, said yesterday the Revenue's usual
test was: 'Are you part of the organisation or are you autonomous?' He
added: 'Clearly the director-general is part of the organisation, only more
so.'
Mr Birt last night rebuffed reporters' questions about the controversy after
he had spoken at a public meeting in Cardiff about BBC finances. The
audience did not ask about his own finances.
The accounts of Mr Birt since he joined the BBC as deputy director-general
show steadily rising turnover and equally rising administrative expenses. In
1987, for instance, turnover was Pounds 93,599 and administrative expenses
were Pounds 77,833 including remuneration and National Insurance for the two
directors, Mr John Birt and Mrs Jane Birt.
By 1989 turnover had risen to Pounds 136,234 and directors' remuneration was
Pounds 82,399. In 1991 directors' fees were Pounds 80,604 out of total
administrative expenses of Pounds 159,174.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Campaign to fight VAT on papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN against taxes on the sales of books and newspapers was launched
yesterday by the newspaper and publishing industry.
The move comes amid indications that one of the Budget options being
considered by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is imposition of either the
full 17.5 per cent level of value added tax or a reduced rate of 5 per cent
on books, newspapers and periodicals.
These, together with other items such as food and childrens' clothes, are
currently exempt from VAT.
The organisers of the Hands Off Reading Campaign warned that a fifth of
local newspapers would be forced to close with the loss of 2,500 jobs if VAT
was imposed, citing figures from a recent Price Waterhouse study. They warn
that at least two national newspapers could be forced to shut.
About 1,700 magazines - a third of the total - would be forced to close, a
similar study by BDO Binder Hamlym warns.
The figures are calculated assuming a VAT rate of 17.5 per cent. But Price
Waterhouse stresses that even the imposition of a reduced rate of tax on the
industry would have devastating effects.
Government statistics show that VAT on newspapers, magazines and books would
raise about Pounds 1bn, about half of which would come from newspapers.
In spite of figures earlier this week showing that book sales are rising,
campaign organisers insist that costlier publications will mean fewer
readers.
According to the campaign's opinion poll a third of people questioned
claimed they would buy fewer newspapers if they were taxed.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Prescription charges to increase by 13%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESCRIPTION charges are to rise by 13 per cent to Pounds 4.25 next month,
the government announced yesterday. The rise of 50p gave rise to protests
and warnings that it would force many patients to do without treatment.
Pre-prescription payment certificates and other charges will also rise by 13
per cent. The charge towards dental treatment will rise from 75 per cent to
80 per cent.
Details of the rises, expected to raise an extra Pounds 278m for the NHS,
were announced by Dr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, in a Commons
written reply. Under the changes, needy and elderly people and those who
receive free prescriptions on medical grounds will remain exempt.
The value of optical vouchers for spectacles, available to children and
people on low incomes, will be raised by 2.75 per cent.
Dr Mawhinney said 80 per cent of prescribed items were dispensed free, more
than at any time since prescription charges were reintroduced in 1968.
He claimed that the new charges were still significantly less than the
average total cost of a single prescription item.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, accused Mrs Virginia Bottomley,
the health secretary, of 'caving in' to the Treasury. He said: 'This is a
government that is prepared to tax the sick and not the rich.'
The British Medical Association said the sick were being used to 'bolster
the severe underfunding of the NHS'. Real growth in NHS funding for this
year stood at less than 1 per cent. It added: 'We would like to see a fairer
system which avoids deterring patients from seeking the necessary medical
treatment.'
The Royal College of Nursing said the rise was 'another hurdle to health
care for many thousands of families hit by recession and unemployment'.
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society warned that more and more patients would be
unable to afford the medicines prescribed for them.
The BMA is telling its members to seek local-level recognition in trust
hospitals in readiness for an expected shift from national bargaining on
doctors' conditions of service.
By next year almost all hospitals and community health services will have
become locally managed trusts which can seek to negotiate changes in terms
now negotiated nationally.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Wider tendering 'would cut costs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUCH greater use of competitive tendering would reduce the cost and improve
the quality of public services, the Institute of Economic Affairs says in a
report published today.
The free-market think tank says local and central government organisations
continue to place obstacles before companies which might bid for contracts.
It identifies scope to extend competitive tendering in local government, the
health service, fire services and some police work.
The institute calls for the Audit Commission, the local-authority watchdog,
to investigate councils which have contracted out few or none of the
services subject to compulsory competitive tendering.
The report says the rule which excludes tendering of activities worth less
than Pounds 100,000 a year should be examined to see if the limit could be
lowered.
The size of some contracts is an obstacle to bidders, the institute says.
Many local authorities package work to be contracted out in ways which suit
their in-house workforce.
The institute says an upper limit should be set on the size of contracts,
forcing the contracting-out organisation to offer separate contracts of more
manageable size. While all the contracts might be won by a single
contractor, 'economies or diseconomies of scale should be discovered rather
than assumed', the report says.
The report also recommends that experiments should be launched in
contracting out the management of hospitals and schools.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Gummer admits egg compensation error
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 100 farmers are to share about Pounds 600,000 in extra
compensation for the compulsory slaughter of their poultry flocks in 1988.
The slaughter was demanded after fears that eggs were contaminated with
salmonella.
The compensation comes after a report from the parliamentary ombudsman
criticised the Ministry of Agriculture over its failure to 'devise and
implement a scheme which complied with the legislation' to pay compensation.
In a Commons' written answer, Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister,
admitted that the decision to discount the value of slaughtered flocks by 40
per cent to reflect the taint of salmonella infection was 'incorrect'.
More than 3.25m hens have been destroyed at a cost in compensation -
excluding the new awards - of Pounds 5.4m.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Assurance over BR pension fund
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday stressed to trustees of
the British Rail pension fund that the government had no 'hidden agenda' for
stripping the fund of its assets.
He said that 'irresponsible speculation' about the future of the pensions
after railway privatisation was needlessly worrying BR pensioners.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Campaign opens against VAT on papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN against taxes on the sales of books and newspapers was launched
yesterday by the newspaper and publishing industry.
The move comes amid indications that one of the Budget options being
considered by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is imposition of either the
full 17.5 per cent level of value added tax or a reduced rate of 5 per cent
on books, newspapers and periodicals.
These, together with other items such as food and childrens' clothes, are
currently exempt from VAT.
The organisers of the Hands Off Reading Campaign warned that a fifth of
local newspapers would be forced to close with the loss of 2,500 jobs if VAT
was imposed, citing figures from a recent Price Waterhouse study. They warn
that at least two national newspapers could be forced to shut.
At the same time about 1,700 magazines - a third of the total - would be
forced to close, a similar study by BDO Binder Hamlym warns.
The figures are calculated assuming a VAT rate of 17.5 per cent. But Price
Waterhouse stresses that even the imposition of a reduced rate of tax on the
industry would have devastating effects.
Mr Alan Marmion, author of the Price Waterhouse survey, said: 'As we
indicate in our report a lot of local newspapers are only just hanging on.
This would be the final straw.'
Government statistics show that VAT on newspapers, magazines and books would
raise about Pounds 1bn, about half of which would come from newspapers.
In spite of figures earlier this week showing that book sales are rising,
campaign organisers insist that costlier publications will mean fewer
readers. According to the campaign's opinion poll a third of people
questioned claimed they would buy fewer newspapers if they were taxed.
Taxing books and newspapers would be less politically sensitive than
imposing VAT on food or children's clothes, but campaigners argue that the
revenue raised would be insignificant.
Mr Tim Godfrey, director of the Booksellers' Association, estimates that
imposing VAT on books at 17.5 per cent would raise only Pounds 100m.
He said:'It would be a body blow for education and make knowledge much more
expensive. But it's a paltry sum for the Treasury.'

FT  03 MAR 93 / Botnar company in Pounds 6m court win
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese motor manufacturer, was yesterday ordered to pay Pounds
6m to Nissan UK, its former British importer, for not honouring an agreement
to provide marketing support for sales of its range of Bluebird cars.
The Pounds 6m payment had been negotiated by Mr Octav Botnar, the chairman
of Nissan UK, as an incentive for taking 12,700 of the cars in the six
months before they went out of production in 1990, the vice-chancellor, Sir
Donald Nicholls, said in the High Court.
Nissan had denied such an agreement had ever been reached. However, Sir
Donald ruled that an agreement had existed and that Nissan UK had fulfilled
its side of it.
Mr Botnar was not in court. He has remained in Switzerland following the
issue of a warrant for his arrest in connection with alleged tax fraud
involving his company.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Aston Martin to boost output with 'cheap' model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTON MARTIN Lagonda, the maker of luxury sports cars taken over by Ford in
1987, yesterday unveiled a new model intended to quadruple production to 800
cars a year in 1995.
The company said the car - named the DB7 - would cost 'less than Pounds
80,000,' which is some Pounds 50,000 less than the cheapest of Aston
Martin's present range. First-year production is expected to be around 300
cars.
The new model will be built at a separate factory in Oxfordshire by a
workforce of 250, instead of at the company's main facilities in Newport
Pagnell, Buckinghamshire.
The main design and development work on the DB7, which has a top speed
potential of more than 160mph, has been contracted out to TWR (Design), part
of the Oxford-based TWR group run by Mr Tom Walkinshaw.
A new company, Aston Martin Oxford, has been formed to operate the facility
at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, in which TWR has taken a 25 per cent stake. The
majority 75 per cent is held by Aston Martin Lagonda.
The DB7's in-line six-cylinder 3.2 litre supercharged engine, although
allocated to Aston Martin's use only, uses a block originally developed by
Jaguar but not used. It is expected to be assembled by Jaguar under contract
at its Radford engine plant near Coventry.
The bodies are to be supplied by Motor Panels, the Coventry-based components
group.
A wholly-owned subsidiary, Aston Martin sales, has been formed to oversee an
expansion of Aston Martin's worldwide dealer network.
The cars are to go on sale in Europe initially, starting in April next year,
and will go on sale in north America in 1995.
Car workers at Peugeot Talbot in Coventry have voted to accept assurances on
job security, ending the threat of industrial action at the company's main
production plant.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Initiative seeks to find the 'export-ready': Fears that not
enough is done for outward goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ONE OF the UK's most ambitious export promotion campaigns
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North America Now - is launched tomorrow at a time of fierce debate over how
governments should best help exporters. Britain is not alone in discovering
that sustained, non-inflationary growth is better driven by exports than
domestic demand. Nor is it alone in worrying about widening trade gaps.
The US campaign is expected to include unique and innovative initiatives to
counter criticism that previous government efforts have targeted the
'export-willing', but have been less successful in pinpointing the
'export-ready'.
A core worry for the British government is that a few exporters account for
a large proportion of exports - 50 companies are responsible for about 44
per cent of visible exports totalling Pounds 108m last year. As a result,
export promotion is invariably targeted at smaller companies, often with
limited success.
There is widespread concern that government efforts to aid exporters often
miss the mark. Trade missions are often dismissed as 'jollies'; backing for
companies to attend trade fairs is attacked as unco-ordinated. The value of
export promotion campaigns - like those focused on Venezuela, Spain and
Kuwait over the past five years - has been questioned, though export figures
provide unclear evidence because they can be influenced by forces ranging
from the recession to currency fluctuations.
Mr Graham Bannock, consultant to the Department of Trade and Industry on a
number of trade issues, and author of an influential government report on
exporting, says: 'Export campaigns don't generate much in the way of
exports. But it's terribly difficult to prove anything.'
Business leaders such as Mr Simon Sperry, chief executive of the London
Chamber of Commerce, say there is disarray on how export services are
delivered, with too many agencies competing for funding.
Mr Ian Campbell, at the Institute of Export, asks when organisations such as
the Institute of Freight Forwarders, the Confederartion of British Industry,
Institute of Marketing, chambers of commerce and Institute of Directors last
met jointly or co-ordinated efforts. 'We need a more co-operative corporate
structure,' he says.
Mr Campbell notes that the budget of the British Overseas Trade Board last
year was Pounds 173m - 'enough to run the health service for 25 hours'.
Apart from concern that there is too little money for export promotion,
there is criticism about lack of continuity at the top of the DTI, which has
had 16 trade secretaries in 24 years.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the present trade and industry secretary, and his
deputy Mr Richard Needham, appear to have impressed industry with their
early efforts to tailor government activities to exporters' needs. Many
industrialists would say that this is long overdue in a country where
exports account for 18 per cent of gross domestic product.
According to one senior CBI executive: 'The fact that the government is now
using the word 'strategy' is an important change from the past. It's not
providing a very complete strategy, but at least it has started to use the
word.'
Mr Needham yesterday identified three prongs to his export promotion
strategy:
Services to improve competitiveness and exportability of British products,
particularly in industrial markets.
Aid to the capital goods industry in developing country markets, with a
target of raising capital goods exports from Pounds 10bn in 1993 to Pounds
20bn by 2000.
Protecting British trading interests in forums such as the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade and in bilateral trade conflicts over products like
steel and cars, or on taxation of international companies.
His strategy is distinctive in its conviction that export promotion starts
with private industry, and at the regional level. It also focuses on
improving the wider manufacturing base rather than just exports, with 'local
economy promotion'.
One area of general complaint in the UK is export finance, where premium
rates to insure exports are often significantly higher than rates offered to
exporters from other countries. Mr Bannock said export finance was 'the one
area where the UK government is demonstrably doing less than other
governments'.
The government has made a strong effort to build into the North America Now
campaign policies that meet industry complaints. Its details will be
scrutinised with care - not just because the US is Britain's most important
export market, but because it will provide clear evidence of whether Mr
Heseltine is putting his own, more effective, stamp on Britain's export
efforts.

FT  03 MAR 93 / DTI warns of costs risk to N Sea oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday warned North Sea oil and gas operators that they
must cut costs or face a threat to the long-term viability of the offshore
industry.
Now that the heyday of North Sea discoveries is over, the government is keen
to maintain the cost-effectiveness of an industry which still invests more
than Pounds 10bn a year and employs 335,000 people.
The concerns are contained in a Department of Trade and Industry report
which highlights the changing nature of the offshore industry.
Future oil and gas finds will be concentrated in much smaller fields, the
report says. The industry must reduce its overheads if it is to exploit
these finds economically.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said: 'Many of the
recommendations will be difficult, requiring innovative thinking and hard
work. But the challenge is to ensure they are delivered. What is at stake
could be a secure future for the UK continental shelf.'
The report makes 29 recommendations, focusing on reduction of paperwork,
streamlining of equipment specifications and greater operator co-operation.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said: 'If the UK continental shelf doesn't
remain competitive, slowly - but inexorably - investment funds will flow to
other oil provinces and the infrastructure will move elsewhere.'
The report says that until 1980 the average size of discoveries in the North
Sea exceeded 150m barrels of oil equivalent (which includes gas). Since then
the average size has been below 50m barrels. Oil prices remain at their
lowest level for 20 years.
Government statistics show that expenditure on offshore oil operations rose
in real terms from Pounds 2.50 a barrel to more than Pounds 4 a barrel in
the three years to 1991, although it is believed to have dropped to Pounds
3.60 a barrel last year.
'Nevertheless, with oil currently trading at Pounds 10 to Pounds 12 per
barrel these costs pose a significant threat to the future viability and
profitability of the North Sea,' the report states.
Mr Eggar stressed the importance of companies working together, for example,
in partnership contracts which share the risks and rewards of developments
between oil companies and contractors.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Scots factory set to win IBM support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is expected to underwrite a project by one
of its subcontractors to build a large factory for assembling its personal
computers close to its plant at Greenock in western Scotland.
The 400,000 sq ft plant would be built and operated by Mimtec, an
electronics manufacturer owned by Murray International Holdings, which is 88
per cent owned by Mr David Murray, one of Scotland's leading entrepreneurs
and chairman of Glasgow Rangers football club.
The move partly reflects the increased demand for IBM's personal computers
since it introduced a new range last autumn. Mimtec is one of several
subcontractors assembling PCs for IBM, using a 75,000 sq ft plant at
Livingston, West Lothian.
Mimtec's new plant is likely to be at Gourock, a few miles from IBM's
Greenock complex. It could open in about a year and employ about 400 people
compared with the 2,200 at Greenock.
The new plant would be built in the Inverclyde enterprise zone, created in
1989 after the rundown of the shipbuilding industry. Projects in enterprise
zones enjoy exemption from business rates and development land tax, and 100
per cent tax allowances against buildings.
Some Pounds 9m of the cost of the plant is likely to be met by an enterprise
zone trust financed by investors, with the rest coming from grants. IBM
would make up any shortfall on the trust and take over the ownership of the
plant when the trust was paid back in a few years.
The IBM plant at Greenock, which supplies Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, allocates much assembly work to subcontractors while keeping its own
workforce stable in order to hold down overheads. In this way subcontractors
carry the burden of rapidly expanding and if necessary reducing their labour
forces.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first business park in the UK dedicated to the manufacture of automotive
components will be set up at Wednesbury, north-west of Birmingham, on the
sites of the former Patent Shaft steelworks and Moorcroft chemical works.
The Black Country Development Corporation, which is responsible for the
regeneration of 10 sq miles of land in the area, yesterday said it had
signed contracts with Kyle Stewart, the property and construction group, to
develop 30 acres.
Mr David Morgan, development corporation chief executive, said talks were at
an advanced stage with the first two prospective tenants of the park. He
said they were British subsidiaries of German and US groups.
The 250-acre park is aimed at exploiting the strengthening of the UK motor
sector, with component manufacture expected to expand to serve new Honda,
Nissan and Toyota plants.
The park will be linked to the national motorway network by the Black
Country spine road which will run between the M5 and the M6. Construction
contracts for the road will be placed later this month.
However, construction of the spine road has been delayed by escalating
costs, and redevelopment of the land at Wednesbury, planned since the mid
1980s, has been thwarted by the collapse of the property market. It had
originally been intended for a retail and leisure complex.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TORY MP's attempt to re-establish manufacturing as a 'national adventure'
won backing yesterday from Mr John Major and the Corporation of London.
Sir Francis McWilliams, lord mayor of London, said at the launch of the
Manufacturing and Construction Industries' Alliance: 'Industry has not
articulated itself well enough, and often the City has not quite understood
what industry is about.'
In September Sir Francis is to launch a Foundation for Manufacturing and
Industry, a charity intended to research the problems of industry.
The prime minister sent a message of support to the alliance, launched by Mr
Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield.
Mr Winterton also received backing from the Labour party, trade unions and
some other backbench Tories.
The results of a Mori survey, released to coincide with the alliance's
launch, show that 49 per cent of the students surveyed were very or fairly
interested in a career in broadcasting or journalism, 39 per cent in public
relations and 38 per cent in teaching.
Only 16 per cent were interested in careers in motor manufacturing and only
10 per cent in textiles.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Tackling 'disarray' in help for exports: Fears that not
enough is done for outward goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTING is scary. Assuming that barriers such as language, customs,
standards and procedures can be overcome, and adequate representation found
in alien markets, the financial exposure alone can be crippling. Uncertainty
is assured.
So says Mr William Nothdurft in a book that will strike a chord with
exporters everywhere, particularly on the eve of the launch of one of the
UK's most ambitious export promotion campaigns - to be called North America
Now.
Details of the US trade campaign - expected to include unique and innovative
government initiatives - will be unveiled by the Department of Trade and
Industry tomorrow. It will be launched at a time of fierce debate over how
governments should best help exporters. Britain is not alone in discovering
that sustained non-inflationary growth is better driven by exports than
domestic demand.
Nor is it alone in worrying about widening trade gaps. Across the Atlantic,
the infant administration of President Clinton is obsessed with the link
between trade and jobs. The Australian government is reviewing the services
it offers exporters. Export promotion is in vogue.
A core worry is that so few exporters account for such a large proportion of
exports. In the UK, the top 50 companies account for about 44 per cent of
visible exports totalling Pounds 108m last year. As a result, export
promotion efforts are invariably targeted at smaller companies, often with
limited success. At the same time, however, there is widespread concern that
government efforts to aid exporters often miss the mark. Trade missions are
often dismissed as 'jollies' - backing for companies to attend trade fairs
is attacked as unco-ordinated.
Government efforts have targeted the 'export-willing', but have been less
successful in pinpointing the 'export-ready'. Even export campaigns have
been questioned. Mr Graham Bannock, a consultant to the DTI on a number of
trade issues, and author of a government report on exporting, says: 'They
don't generate much in the way of exports. But it's terribly difficult to
prove anything convincingly because of the wide variety of other factors
that can effect export performance over a period of time.'
Business leaders such as Mr Simon Sperry, chief executive of the London
Chamber of Commerce, say there is 'disarray' on the delivery mechanism for
export services. He says there are too many agencies - including Enterprise
Agencies, Local Employer Networks, Training and Enterprise Agencies and
One-stop Shops - competing for funding, and in the end not providing a
quality job. At the Institute of Export, Mr Ian Campbell points to
export-active organisations such as Tecs, the Institute of Freight
Forwarders, the Confederation of British Industry, Institute of Marketing,
chambers of commerce and the Institute of Directors, and asks: 'When did
they last meet jointly, or co-ordinate efforts? We need a more co-operative
corporate structure.'
Mr Campbell notes that the budget of the British Overseas Trade Board last
year amounted to Pounds 173m - 'enough to run the health service for 25
hours'. Of this, Pounds 123m goes on staff salaries at the DTI and their
equivalents in Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland, and on payments to
embassies abroad for commercial services.
Apart from concern that too little money has been budgeted for export
promotion, there are criticisms of the lack of continuity at the head of the
DTI. It has had 16 ministers in 24 years, with just three of them lasting
beyond two years.
Nevertheless Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr
Richard Needham, a junior DTI minister, appear to have impressed industry
with their early efforts to tailor government activities to meet exporters'
needs. For a country in which exports account for 18 per cent of gross
domestic product, many industrialists would say this is long overdue.
Defining his export promotion strategy yesterday, Mr Needham identified
three prongs - services to improve competitiveness and the exportability of
British products, particularly in industrial export markets; aid to the
capital goods industry to help them take opportunities in developing country
markets, with a target of raising capital goods exports from Pounds 10bn in
1993 to Pounds 20bn by 2000; and the protection of British trading interests
in forums such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in
bilateral trade conflicts over products like steel, cars, procurement, or on
taxation of international companies.
What is distinctive in Mr Needham's strategy is a conviction that export
promotion starts with private industry, and at the regional level.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Aston Martin to boost output with 'cheap' model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTON MARTIN Lagonda, the maker of luxury sports cars taken over by Ford in
1987, yesterday unveiled a new model intended to quadruple production to 800
cars a year in 1995.
The company said the car - named the DB7 - would cost 'less than Pounds
80,000,' which is some Pounds 50,000 less than the cheapest of Aston
Martin's model range. First-year production is expected to be around 300
units.
The DB designation - the initials of former company owner Sir David Brown -
is being revived for the first time in 20 years. It re-establishes a link
with a long line of previous DB models, the most famous of which was almost
certainly the DB4 which starred alongside Sean Connery in early James Bond
films.
Aston Martin's 'cheap' DB7 model will mark a radical departure from its past
on several industrial fronts.
The new model will be built at a separate factory in Oxfordshire by a
workforce of 250, instead of at the company's main facilities in Newport
Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. The Buckinghamshire plant now employs 260 people
making 200 Virage and Vantage models a year at prices from Pounds 125,000 to
Pounds 175,00.
The main design and development work on the DB7, which has a top speed
potential of more than 160mph, has been contracted out to TWR (Design), part
of the TWR group run by Mr Tom Walkinshaw based in Oxford. It develops and
manufactures Jaguar's high-performance sports and racing cars. Jaguar itself
is wholly owned by Ford.
A new company, Aston Martin Oxford, has been formed to operate the facility
at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, in which TWR has taken a 25 per cent stake. The
majority 75 per cent is held by Aston Martin Lagonda.
The DB7's in-line six-cylinder 3.2 litre supercharged engine, although
allocated to Aston Martin's use only, uses a block originally developed  -
but not used - by Jaguar. It is expected to be assembled by Jaguar under
contract at its Radford engine plant near Coventry.
The car's bodies are to be supplied by Motor Panels, the Coventry-based
components group.
A wholly-owned subsidiary, Aston Martin sales, has been formed to oversee an
expansion of Aston Martin's worldwide dealer network.
Aston Martin has only 37 dealers at present, but several times this number
are expected to be needed to handle the new model. The cars are to go on
sale in Europe initially, starting in April next year, and will go on sale
in north America in 1995.
The Bloxham facility is being taken over from Jaguarsport, a joint venture
company between Jaguar and TWR which has been responsible for building the
Pounds 400,000-plus Jaguar 220 sports car. Production of these is scheduled
to be completed by the end of this year.
Aston Martin refused yesterday to comment on the size of investment required
for the DB7 project.
Mr Walter Hayes, the former vice-president of Ford of Europe who is now
Aston's executive chairman, has made no secret of his ambitions to restore
Aston Martin's position in the world luxury sports car sector. Before being
bought by Ford it had several brushes with receivership, and lacked the
resources for adequate new model programmes.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Republicans ponder Clinton plan: Little resistance to
economic proposals among divided opposition on Capitol Hill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday was due to hold hours of meetings with his
Republican opponents on Capitol Hill. Given the extent to which they have
attacked his economic plan for raising taxes too much and cutting spending
too little, the visit might seem a foolhardy running of the gauntlet.
However, the Republicans have had so little success in agreeing on a
strategy to counter the Clinton plan that the president seemed likely to
emerge unscathed.
Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader in the Senate, said he and his
colleagues had no plans to insult or criticise the president, but were
reluctant to offer specific proposals for amending Mr Clinton's plan unless
they received some assurance that they would be considered seriously.
'If we come up with some alternatives, will he seriously negotiate those, or
are we just playing games?' Mr Dole asked yesterday morning.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, responded that Mr Clinton
would be more than happy to entertain specific ideas from the Republicans
for spending cuts.
'There's obviously some philosophical disagreement between the president and
the Republican leaders. That doesn't mean he is not willing to listen to
their specific suggestions to add additional spending cuts or make the plan
better,' she said.
The White House has so far concentrated on ensuring a reasonable degree of
party loyalty among Mr Clinton's Democratic supporters, who hold majorities
in both the House and the Senate. This is likely to be enough, at least to
secure an early budget resolution containing the broad outlines of Mr
Clinton's plan.
Mr Robert Michel, the Republican leader in the House, concedes that he will
probably not be able to win over enough Democrats to block passage.
But when Congress starts to consider the plan in detail this summer, Mr
Clinton may need Republican votes to counter Democratic defections,
particularly to ensure the survival of cuts in agricultural subsidies that
are popular with many rural congressmen.
The Republicans, however, remain deeply split over how to react to the
Clinton plan.
This split is partly over tactics, between those who believe that their job
is to ensure that the Clinton plan passes in a form that is as
unobjectionable as possible, and those who argue that the task of the
opposition is to oppose.
But it is also over ideology -between the traditional deficit hawks, who
want to concentrate on proposing deeper spending cuts than Mr Clinton has
included, and the supply side idealists, who insist that cutting taxes is
the only answer.
If they cannot come up with a persuasive response, they could be outflanked
by public support for Mr Clinton's proposals, which have won the approval of
59 per cent of those questioned last week for a Washington Post-ABC News
poll.
Most of those questioned said the Clinton plan would hurt them personally,
but 62 per cent believed, nevertheless, that it would help the economy. And
although more than two thirds felt Mr Clinton was not doing enough to cut
the deficit or reduce government spending, a majority also wanted him to go
further in taxing the rich and stimulating the economy.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK last night put the economic dislocation costs of the bombing of the
World Trade Centre, which killed five people, at nearly Dollars 700m (Pounds
493m) in the first week alone, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The figures, published by New York city comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman,
include Dollars 360m in immediate short-term costs of repairing the
buildings and business losses. The cost of the first week is estimated at
Dollars 332m, with a cost of Dollars 90m for Monday and declining by about
10 per cent each day as businesses find alternative means of operating. This
would bring cumulative costs to Dollars 887m if the World Trade Centre
towers reopen by March 15.
Ms Holtzman said the biggest economic impact appears to be in terms of lost
business. Companies may attempt to recoup losses by making claims against
the New York Port Authority 'but to the extent that such payments reduced
the Port Authority's ability to invest in the region's transportation
infrastructure, that would hurt the region'.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Mexican air traffic control deal upheld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE multinational companies which protested against the award of a Dollars
21m (Pounds 15m) contract to install a new air traffic control system in
Mexico have lost a battle to have the contract overturned.
Mexico's government watchdog announced last month that it had found no
irregularities in the contract tender and rejected the complaints.
The five - IBM Air Traffic Control, Calmaquip of Miami, Raytheon's Canadian
subsidiary, Siemens Plessey Electronic Systems and Nissho Iwai  - had
complained that an initial tender offer for the contract was unjustifiably
cancelled by the Mexican Ministry of Transport and Communications. It said
none of the bids complied with the contract requirements, a statement
contradicted by each company.
Mr Kaveh Moussavi, an agent then acting for IBM, further claimed that three
men, whom he took to be government officials, asked him for Dollars 1m to
secure the contract. He refused to pay and 10 days later the tender offer
was cancelled.
Mexico's General Comptroller of the Federation investigated the complaints
lodged by the five companies for several weeks before concluding that the
contract was justifiably awarded to Thomson of France and Alenia of Italy in
a second tender.
In supporting its case, the comptroller showed excerpts from an independent
report by the Canadian subsidiary of Martin Marietta of the US, which
indicated where the losing companies had not complied with the original
specifications in the first tender. The comptroller also said that it was
unable to pursue Mr Moussavi's allegations, because he had offered no names
or evidence of his encounter.
Mr Moussavi, however, says the government investigation into his claims was
perfunctory. He was denounced on pro-government television and threatened
with prison by the minister of transport and communications, actions which
he said would deter future whistle-blowers.
The investigation has been criticised by others. A foreign diplomat said
that a 'major weakness' in the government's investigation was that the
comptroller was limited to looking at procedure and rules, and not at the
quality of the different technologies.
Calmaquip maintains that it complied with the required specifications. Mr
Armando Paz, its chief financial officer, has demanded to see the background
papers of the Martin Marietta report.
Complaints by foreign companies about the awarding of contracts are not rare
in Mexico: the comptroller reports there were 400 last year, about 1 per
cent of all government contracts.
The number of complaints may reflect in part differences in business
practices in Mexico and the US. As the diplomat said: 'In the US and Canada
performance details (of the technology) are more significant than the
absolute adherence to the letter of the contract. In Mexico any deviation
from code, however unimportant, can lead to disqualification.'
However, such deviations are sometimes overlooked if a company establishes
good relations with those issuing a contract, according to a businessman
representing a big British company in Mexico. 'In Mexico, a decision is
often based on who they know and trust, so good contacts can be invaluable.
While I do not pay bribes, our Mexican agents can share their commissions.'
He believed this was common practice.
Encouraged by the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement, more foreign
companies are contemplating business in Mexico.

FT  03 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Nissan to export Spanish 4WD vehicles to
Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese car maker, is to start exporting vehicles from its
Spanish plant in Barcelona to Japan next year with planned volumes of up to
12,000 a year.
Shipping four-wheel-drive (4WD) leisure/utility vehicles from Spain will be
the second export programme from Europe to Asia for Nissan, which already
exports up to 10,000 cars a year to Japan and Taiwan from its UK car plant
in Sunderland.
Nissan said it planned to export 10,000 units of its new Spanish-built
Terrano II four-wheel-drive vehicle to Japan in 1994, rising to 12,000 a
year.
Nissan Motor Iberica, its majority-owned Spanish subsidiary, said yesterday
that it had plunged into a loss of Pta14.37bn (Pounds 85.53m) last year in
the midst of its ambitious expansion programme.
Mr Juan Echevarria, Nissan Motor Iberica executive chairman, warned that the
company did not expect to return to profit before 1995.
Continuing losses and rising indebtedness, combined with the company's
commitment to a heavy capital expenditure programme, are expected to force a
capital restructuring.
Nissan Motor Iberica has spent more than Pta100bn on capital spending and
product development in the past two years, however, to try to transform
itself into a maker of vehicles for the European passenger car market based
on its Serena people carrier and the Terrano II.
It said yesterday it still planned to increase total vehicle production to
135,000 in 1995 from 79,450 last year. Output of the Serena is planned to
rise to 20,000 this year from 8,700 in 1992, and output of the Terrano II is
expected to increase from 35,700 this year to more than 64,000 in 1994
including the exports to Japan.
Some 22,000 Terrano IIs will be supplied to Ford, the US vehicle maker,
which will market the vehicle under the name Ford Maverick through its own
European dealer network.

FT  03 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Clinton falls quiet about minivans - The
campaign hit that was always out of tune
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS presidential candidate, Bill Clinton took a stand on minivans, attacking
the 'Dollars 300m trade break' given to Japan in 1989, when the Bush
administration declined to raise the US tariffs on minivans to 25 per cent.
Nowadays, Mr Clinton does not talk about minivans. The minivan controversy
is not likely to appear on the list of American trade priorities, which is
due to be released this week by the Office of the US Trade Representative.
Nor did it receive a mention when the president gave what was billed as a
definitive address on trade and international economics in Washington last
Friday.
In fact, Mr Clinton could be in the process of backpedalling from his
hawkish rhetoric on this particular issue.
During the campaign, Mr Clinton - intentionally or not - seemed badly
briefed on minivans. He seemed convinced that the Bush administration had
succumbed to lavishly-financed Japanese lobbyists and reclassified
multi-purpose vehicles as cars, when they had always been trucks, in order
to give the imports a lower tariff rate.
Although the reverse was closer to the truth, Candidate Clinton's tune
played like a symphony in Detroit.
The US tariff on light trucks has been 25 per cent since 1964, when
President Lyndon Johnson raised the duty in the infamous 'chicken war' to
punish West Germany. Later, when minivans and sport-utility vehicles became
popular, it was debatable whether, in fact, they should be classified as
cars - with a 2.5 per cent tariff - or trucks.
After much controversy, the US Treasury Department in 1989 ruled that
two-door multipurpose vehicles generally would be classified as trucks,
because their principal purpose could be described as the transport of
goods.
Four-door multipurpose vehicles were classified as cars - as they had been
previously - because they were clearly designed for transporting people, the
Treasury said. Vans with side windows and rear seats to accommodate at least
two people were deemed cars.
This decision raised - rather than lowered - the number of multipurpose
vehicles which were classified as trucks, the Treasury said at the time.
In 1989, about 239,000 minivans and sport utility vehicles entered the US.
About 44 per cent were classified as trucks and 56 per cent as cars. Under
the new definitions, 62 per cent would have been classified as trucks and 39
per cent as cars.
As a result of the ruling, US manufacturers have been able to retain such a
dominant share of the market, that the US International Trade Commission
found itself unable to sustain a finding of 'injury' last year, when the
domestic producers tried to raise the tariffs through a dumping action.
Having failed in that quarter, Detroit tried to secure the entire market
through legislation.
A bill to raise the tariff made it through the House, but was stopped by the
Senate Finance Committee, headed by the then Senator Lloyd Bentsen.
Mr Bentsen is now the Treasury secretary, in charge of the Customs Service,
which makes him a key player on this issue, as well as many others. The
Treasury is said to have produced four options: doing nothing; raising all
the tariffs for minivans and sports utility vehicles to 25 per cent;
establishing a new tariff classification; or sending the whole matter back
to Congress.
'It has been kicked down to working group level,' said one closely connected
lobbyist, who called the controversy 'a real tar baby'. She continued: 'The
administration has to decide if this is the issue they want to go to the mat
on.'
What happens next could depend on who gets the recommendation. Will it be
the Bill Clinton who apparently found the minivan issue useful during the
campaign to blunt criticism for his support of the North American Free Trade
Agreement?
Will it be the president who has railed against Airbus subsidies while
supporting research and development subsidies for US manufacturing? Will it
be the scrapper who promised not to 'roll over and play dead' for the
Europeans?
Or will it be the president who vows not to pursue 'a policy of blame but
one of responsibility'? The one who sees as 'the truth of our age' that
'open and competitive commerce will enrich as a nation'.
Bill Clinton is a pragmatist, who recognises the irreversibility of the
global economy and insists that open US markets be met by 'comparable'
market openings abroad.
It is the pragmatist who last Friday complained that the Uruguay Round 'has
dragged on entirely too long'. It is probably the pragmatist who will
recognise that a higher tariff on minivan imports will raise new suspicions
that the US is really set to pursue a divisive and protectionist course.

FT  03 MAR 93 / US new home sales down 13.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US SALES of new homes plunged 13.8 per cent between December and January,
but the figures may have been distorted by bad weather, Commerce Department
figures indicated yesterday.
The official index of leading indicators - a guide to future economic
developments - stagnated in January, a setback after big increases in
preceding months.
Analysts said the reports confirmed other recent data suggesting the pace of
economic growth had slowed from an annual rate of nearly 5 per cent in the
final quarter of last year to an annual rate of perhaps 3 per cent.
Some forecasters, however, are growing more bearish. Mr Allen Sinai, chief
economist at The Boston Group, an economic consultancy, said economic growth
might dip to an annual rate of only 1-2 per cent in the current quarter,
raising doubts about whether or not the upturn can be sustained.
The drop in new home sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 561,000
in January was the steepest in 11 years and left sales at their lowest level
in eight months. Sales figures were 17 per cent lower than in January last
year, a strong month for the housing market.
However, most of the decline occurred in the north-east and west, regions
affected by bad weather conditions. Sales in the south were unchanged and
sales in the Midwest dipped only modestly.
Sharp falls in mortgage rates and a recent decline in the 'affordability
index' - the ratio of house prices to incomes - are widely expected to
underpin the market this year.
Mr Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street
brokerage, predicted 'very robust growth in the home-building sector' later
this year.
The index of leading indicators rose 0.1 per cent in January after robust
increases of 0.7 per cent and 1.7 per cent in November and December.
Components of the leading index moved in opposite directions, with five
indicators signalling expansion and six contraction.
The positive indicators included a rise in unfilled orders for manufactured
goods, higher prices for sensitive materials and a longer average working
week.

</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday announced further moves under the disputes
procedure of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to resolve EC-US
tensions provoked by Washington's decision to impose preliminary duties on
some steel products.
The Commission said it had formally requested consultations under Gatt's
anti-dumping code, to check whether US actions on steel were consistent with
Gatt rules.
The announcement in Brussels came amid renewed challenges to ways the US
Commerce Department calculates alleged material injury to the US steel
industry, and extent of EC producer subsidies.
Despite the critical tone, EC officials stressed that Brussels intended to
avoid escalating the steel dispute and was deliberately avoiding talk of
retaliation.
The consultations under Gatt aimed to 'clarify' rather than reach a final
agreement on steel subsidies, they said.
One way of avoiding definitive anti-dumping duties would be for Gatt members
to forge a multilateral steel agreement, phasing out steel tariffs in return
for banning most subsidies. The US government could then ask US steel
producers to drop their complaints against foreign producers.
The US International Trade Commission will vote on whether the steel
industry has been injured on July 27.
