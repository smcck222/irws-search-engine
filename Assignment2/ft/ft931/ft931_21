FT  25 FEB 93 / Smith loosens Labour's union ties: Opposition leader
supports end to block vote in selection of candidates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH loosened Labour's historic links with the trade unions
yesterday by backing a reduction and reshaping of their role and power
within party.
At a meeting of the party's ruling National Executive Committee, Mr Smith
made it clear that he wants to end the unions' ability to vote in the
selection of parliamentary candidates and to vote in the election of the
leader and deputy leader.
The move, if implemented, could mark a watershed for the trade unions which
have dominated the Labour movement throughout this century.
But Mr Smith was more cautious about the share of votes accounted for by
trade unions at the party conference. He supported 'individualising' each
union's block vote - splitting it among the union's delegates - but made it
clear that cutting the total union vote below the 70 per cent level agreed
for this year's conference, should depend on a rise in individual party
membership above the current figure of 280,000.
The aim is to give local parties an incentive to recruit, so that the
unions' share of the conference vote would fall to 50 per cent. It would
not, however, fall lower.
In spite of the evident desire not to alienate those who want to retain
traditional union links, there was thinly disguised anger from some trade
unionists. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General
Union, emphasised that the proposals were still subject to consultation. Mr
John Prescott and Ms Clare Short, leftwing members of the NEC, said that
yesterday represented the beginning of consultations on the issue - not the
end.
The NEC will agree in July on recommendations to be put to Labour's annual
conference in October. These will also cover the unions' role in elections
to the NEC itself.
Attempting to head off criticism, Mr Smith said the reforms he envisaged
were, 'in no sense a divorce between the Labour party and the trade union
movement. It is a modernising and strengthening of the links between the
Labour party and the trade union movement and should be understood as that.'
For the election of party leader and deputy leader, Mr Smith proposed 50 per
cent of votes should be for MPs and MEPs and 50 per cent for constituency
parties on a 'one member, one vote' basis.
Despite the unhappiness voiced by some leading union figures, Mr Neil
Kinnock, former Labour leader, believed that 'common sense dictates and the
welfare of the party dictates' that the trade unions would back Mr Smith's
proposals.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Brussels to increase aid for industrially declining regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission intends to devote greater resources to poor and
industrially declining regions, including Merseyside in the UK, and eastern
Germany.
The Commission yesterday adopted a plan to try to arrest industrial decline
as part of the Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 117bn) EC structural aid programme agreed
at December's Edinburgh summit.
The traditional industrial regions of Merseyside, Hainaut in southern
Belgium, and the eastern Lander, or states, of Germany will be entitled to
the higher levels of funding hitherto devoted to backward regions and the
poorest member states. Highlands and Islands in Scotland also qualifies for
the higher funding.
Brussels also wants to reform the Social Fund, devoted until now to training
both young and long-term unemployed, to target part of its warchest to
industries facing structural change. The object is to retrain workers before
they become unemployed - a move seen by some member states including the UK
as a disguised industrial policy.
The Social Fund was worth Ecu7.2bn out of a total EC structural aid budget
of Ecu63bn in the 1989-93 period.
The Commission is also seeking greater flexibility in the criteria for
allocating aid to so-called 'Objective 2' areas, or industrial regions in
decline. The plan here is to channel money to areas which may not now have
high enough unemployment to qualify for grants, but which are vulnerable to
big factory closures.
This more direct attention to industrial restructuring was largely brushed
aside at the Edinburgh summit, when the 12 agreed the 'Delors 2' package on
EC finances for 1994-99. When the package was being put together last year,
the intention was to target funds towards industries like defence,
electronics, cars and textiles, to improve European competitiveness.
Although the emphasis now is on preserving and creating jobs, a row over
whether this constitutes market-distorting interventionism can be expected
when the Commission plans go to the Council of Ministers. A decision on the
whole package, and the dividing up of funding, is not expected until June.
Additional controversy is expected over Brussels' plans to involve workers
and employers in designing the new training programmes. 'We all know this
will be controversial, and I can think of one member state which won't like
it,' said Mr Bruce Millan, EC regional policy commissioner, in a reference
to the UK. In London, the proposals won little favour among British
ministers, who in the past, have resisted any policy seen as 'propping up'
ailing industries.
Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner, said 'in the past we've
concentrated on the cure' for unemployment through the Social Fund. 'In the
future, we want to give more attention to prevention'. The focus would be on
retraining workers, threatened by 'new production systems', to maintain
their jobs or help them find alternatives.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something unreal about sterling's fall to a record low against the
D-Mark yesterday. If anything, short-run expectations of further rate cuts
have been receding. The seven wise men did warn of the risks to the recovery
at the end of last week, and increased loss provisions at National
Westminster could point to persistent economic weakness. But other
indicators like retail sales and money supply growth have grown more hopeful
of late. So there is no obvious reason to push sterling down.
It may be a matter of D-Mark strength rather than sterling weakness. The
Bundesbank could take inflation figures from the German regions, especially
those showing Bavarian consumer prices rising 0.5 per cent this month, as
justification for its cautious response to January's fall in M3 money
supply. Its money market operations yesterday confirm that it is in no rush
to cut official interest rates.
In theory that should spell more danger for currencies struggling to stay in
the ERM than for sterling. Pressure has been returning to the system this
week. Chances are it will intensify and spread as the French election
approaches. But for the time being the easy profits are to be made in
selling currencies such as sterling and the lira which are free to fall. The
UK does not have a political crisis on the Italian scale. Yet there is the
government's Maastricht disarray and its apparent confusion on economic
policy. Paradoxically, the best way for Mr Lamont to stabilise sterling
might be to cut rates to the point where the market knows he can go no
further.

FT  25 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Akzo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Respectable full-year figures from Akzo should not lull the market into a
false sense of security. By the time ICI, DSM and the three German chemicals
giants have reported, the small rise in profits and maintained dividend is
likely to stand out from a miserable crowd. Akzo owes its resilience to a
solid pharmaceuticals business, minimal exposure to overcrowded
petrochemicals and a more urgent approach to rationalisation than most
European rivals. Yet since operating profits were 14 per cent ahead in the
first half of the year, the slide in the second half was severe. That does
not bode well for the rest of the sector.
Neither can Akzo afford to rest on its laurels. European chemicals companies
already face high costs compared to their US competition. A stronger dollar
may mask the difference, but there is no escaping the long-term need to
improve productivity. Equally, the devaluation of sterling, the peseta and
the lira places Akzo at a disadvantage in Europe. That will be particularly
painful in fibres, the weak link in an otherwise well-balanced portfolio.
Having cut the dividend two years ago, Akzo looks something of a safe haven.
Given the dire trading outlook, dividend cuts elsewhere should come as no
surprise. But the suspicion remains that this prospect is nowhere near
priced into the market.

FT  25 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK competition policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tarzan is clearly quite happy applying the law of the jungle. By
unexpectedly rejecting the Office of Fair Trading's recommendation and
clearing Airtours bid for rival package tour operator, Owners Abroad, Mr
Michael Heseltine has perhaps signalled a shift in the regulatory regime.
The trade and industry secretary's decision certainly raises some ticklish
questions about the predictability of competition policy.
If Airtours' bid succeeds, its market share would push through the 25 per
cent barrier, which was previously assumed to be the trigger point for a
Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation. It would also give the two
biggest players control of more than 60 per cent of the market. But it would
be rash to conclude that a deliberate policy change is under way. The DTI
has previously ignored the OFT's advice without reappraising competition
policy. Moreover, there were many specific considerations in this case. The
DTI suggests barriers to entry are low while the industry is intensely
competitive. Having blithely allowed Thomson to assume such a dominant
market position in the first place, it may simply have seen a stronger
Airtours as an effective counterbalance.
Nevertheless, companies may feel tempted to test the limits of competition
policy. Some suspect the climate may be more amenable to 1960s-style
industrial restructurings leading to the emergence of national champions. If
such is the intention, the package tour industry seems a strange place to
start. Especially when the philosophy has been so sketchily explained.

FT  25 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: BAe brought to book
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders saw Pounds 917m of their funds evaporate from the British
Aerospace balance sheet in 1992. So getting back Pounds 35m in dividends
must feel like pretty thin gruel. Still, it is a reasonably cheap gesture by
the board in the direction of its wounded investors. Since the company has
dealt with its most immediate problems, and a measure of financial
discipline has been imposed, some optimism seems in order. Earnings should
recover this year to give decent dividend cover once more. The company has
clearly come a long way from the depths of last September.
However, the hole blown in the balance sheet is a constraint on the
company's ability to rationalise its operations further. BAe's capital is
now only 10 per cent more than that demanded by its banking covenants. It
can scarcely afford another disaster. By the same token, progress on finding
a partner for the turbo-prop division may be slow if BAe cannot afford the
write-off involved in a joint venture. And the much-touted sale of Rover may
not materialise given that the carmaker would probably not even fetch its
book value. Weakness in the Airbus order book and doubts about some leases
are also a source of unease. Indeed, putting the whole Airbus adventure on
to a secure commercial footing is probably the main strategic challenge now
facing the company.
On top of that there will be a cash outflow this year and gearing may rise
quite sharply. That may not matter too much, but the chairman, Mr John
Cahill, has said that generation of strong and sustained cash flow is the
acid test. By that measure the company still has some way to go.

The problem of how to get rid of a director when you can't find his body is
one of those corporate governance technicalities few company secretaries
have to face. No such mercy, however, for Sean Ryan, who keeps the minutes
for Irish Life.
He was refreshingly honest when Observer contacted him about the departure
from his board of former finance director Brendan Hayes, whom nobody has
apparently seen since last September.
Because no death certificate has ever been issued, Irish Life has had to
invoke a little-known rule by which, if board members fail to show up for
six months at a stretch, they automatically vacate their directorship.
'Tragic though it is, Brendan had to be removed somehow,' explained Ryan.

So where does The Weir Group, Scotland's most successful engineering
company, stand in the battle for survival at Britain's naval dockyards?
After all, the campaign to secure the navy's Trident submarine work at
Rosyth has become a national crusade in Scotland.
However, Glasgow's Weir Group has its feet firmly in the Sassenach camp. It
owns 30 per cent of Devonport Management (DML). 'This certainly looks like
an anomalous position for a Scottish company,' says the third Viscount Weir,
chairman, 'but then Babcock, which owns 75 per cent of Rosyth, is English.
So it's all square. The issue is the future of the Royal Navy which is
neither Scottish nor English but British. So it's a British problem.'
Despite such courageous talk Lord Weir was outnumbered 17 to one by
pro-Rosyth peers when the House of Lords debated the issue this month.
But the main point is that, contrary to popular belief, the Scottish
establishment is almost always divided on big issues. It was split over
Guinness's takeover of Distillers, and over Elders IXL's unsuccessful bid
for Scottish &amp; Newcastle. And there were Scottish troops on both sides at
the battle of Culloden in 1745.

A hundred paper millionaires at a Taiwanese flour-mill are wishing they'd

Last pay day, their wages were multiplied by 10,000 by the computer
crediting their bank accounts, upping their half-month's earnings to nearly
Pounds 3m apiece.
Before most of them got their hands on it, however, the Bank of Taiwan
spotted and corrected the computer's mistake. And even though a dozen
managed to draw out some of the unexpected riches, it was apparently not
enough for them to retire on.
The bank says it is confident of recovering the erroneous payments because
it has arranged for the mill to fire the recipients if they don't repay the
cash.

There is a touch of irony in Roger McKechnie's decision to sell his Phileas

Indeed, UB is portraying the vendors as supportive long-term investors.
However, if McKechnie had himself seen the promise of enduring support from
the City, he wouldn't now be handing in his chips. His company, one of the
few success stories in north-east England, needed a hefty capital injection
if it was to expand, and McKechnie was dubious whether City institutions
would stand by him long term.
As for his new UB shares, the 51-year-old stresses that there are no ties.

President Clinton has been sneered at for delaying his decision on whether

After 17 years of being admired by neighbours as a much-decorated albeit
poor war veteran, retired General Tito Anibal da Paixao Gomes has been
exposed as not only an impostor, but a woman.
The discovery was made by police when, having arrested the dignified figure
for debt offences, they could not find the name in military records. The
prisoner turned out to be Teresinha Gomes, last seen in Madeira in 1974.
The neighbours' surprise, however, was as nothing to the shock the general's
wife received on making the same discovery. Five years after accepting the
self-styled wounded warrior's proposal of a chaste marriage, retired nurse
Joaquina Costa spotted the truth when she went unannounced into the

FT  25 FEB 93 / Breaking point for nerves of steel: German steelmakers are
trying to raise the political temperature over a crisis-hit industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Steel manufacturers are not normally men to mince their words, and German
steelmakers are no exception.
In the past four weeks, the two most powerful men in the German steel
industry - Mr Heinz Kriwet of Thyssen, and Mr Gerhard Cromme of the newly
forged Krupp-Hoesch combine - have suggested that, if European steel
policies do not change, they might pull their companies out of production
altogether.
The question is: are they bluffing? It is scarcely imaginable that two such
giants of the industry, whose entire wealth and reputation was built on the
back of mass steel production, could begin to contemplate abandoning it
entirely. Yet both have diversified in the past two decades and today their
steel interests are a huge drain on the profitability of the rest of their
engineering and trading interests.
Mr Cromme says the question of whether to abandon steel production is
'perfectly realistic'. Of course he does not want to do it, and he is
pursuing all possible remedies to stem his losses from steel production. But
at least he is prepared to entertain the thought.
Mr Kriwet puts it like this: 'If the political establishment cannot or will
not protect the private sector structures in the European steel industry
from unfair competition, then we as entrepreneurs will be forced to take
action - not because we want to, but because circumstances beyond our
control are forcing us to do it.'
Yesterday, more than 10,000 steelworkers from the plants of Thyssen and
Krupp in Duisburg, the grimy heart of the German steel industry, marched to
the so-called Solidarity Bridge across the river Rhine to protest against
the loss of up to 7,000 jobs in their steel town alone. There were calls for
protest strikes, and ringing condemnations of both Bonn and Brussels for
failing to protect the industry. The IG Metall trade union wants a
declaration from Brussels that the industry is in 'manifest crisis', and the
imposition of production quotas EC-wide. The slogan of solidarity was much
in evidence.
The question is: are they bluffing? For it is barely five years since they
were on the streets of Duisburg, fighting (and winning) to save the
Rheinhausen steel plant from closure. Now it is under threat once again.
They know thousands of jobs are going to go: the only question is where. As
for the solidarity, there is precious little in evidence.
The steelworkers of Rheinhausen are competing with their comrades at the
Hoesch steelworks in Dortmund to see which of the two will survive the
drastic programme of capacity cuts which Mr Cromme has ordered. And they are
also acutely conscious that they face cut-price competition both from
eastern Europe, and from eastern Germany itself. Either jobs go in the east,
or they go in the west.
It is clear that both the German steel bosses and their employees are
playing politics in an overwhelmingly political industry. They are seeking
to raise the political pressure on both Bonn and Brussels in the immediate
run-up to today's debate in the EC Council of Ministers. At stake is a
rescue package for the European steel industry in exchange for significant
cuts of some 30m tonnes in production capacity.
The German steelmakers are up in arms because they are facing a new round of
plant closures and mass redundancies, after always being the most efficient,
least feather-bedded operators in the entire European industry. This time,
they believe, it should not be their turn.
Out of DM121bn (Pounds 51bn) in state subsidies paid to European steel
companies between 1975 and 1990, German producers received just DM7bn: the
statistics are distributed with equal enthusiasm both by the manufacturers
in the German steel federation, and the IG Metall trade union. Since 1980,
more than 120,000 jobs have been axed in the German steel industry, or
precisely half the 240,000 cut in the EC industry.
Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German steel federation, believes that
Germany needs only to cut about 5m tonnes of production capacity to bring
its capacity utilisation back to an 'economic' 85 per cent. If it has to cut
capacity according to its EC market share, it will lose more like 9m tonnes.
Whatever happens, he fears that 35,000 to 40,000 jobs may go.
He blames a whole complex of factors - both external and internal - which
have hit the industry simultaneously, on top of the very sharp downturn in
the German economy, 18 months after the rest of Europe slipped into
recession.
On the external front, the EC market has been left wide open to cut-price
east European (and ex-Soviet) imports. 'It was a big political mistake to
open up our market so quickly,' Mr Vondran says. East European steel is
heavily subsidised through artificially low prices of coal, iron ore and
energy.
Since 1990, German imports from the east have more than doubled, from a
monthly average of nearly 86,000 tonnes, to 195,000 tonnes last year: they
account for the largest part of an EC-wide increase, from 240,000 to
370,000, in the same period.
The east Europeans, as well as the Russians and Ukrainians, are exporting,
above all, long products, such as steel girders, wire rods and bars.
'Two-thirds of our problems lie with long products, and only one-third with
flat steel production,' Mr Vondran says.
In a weak market, the east European imports have had a disproportionately
destabilising effect. The US decision to bring anti-dumping suits against 84
importers from 21 countries was the second external blow. Mr Vondran says it
will displace up to 6.5m tonnes of steel from the US market, 600,000 tonnes
supplied from Germany.
Internally, the continual complaint of the German industry is that the EC
reforms of the 1980s failed to stop subsidy payments to grossly inefficient
steel manufacturers. 'Brussels closed its eyes and allowed inefficient
plants to carry on. It was the easy option,' Mr Vondran says.
He cites the state-owned steel producers in Italy and Spain as prime
offenders, and he argues that, from now on, they should only receive
subsidies in direct proportion to the production capacity they remove.
The German industry wants a 'market solution' from Brussels which will allow
the efficient manufacturers to prosper, and the weak to fail. Yet it also
wants more 'social' support to ease the cost of redundancies, and external
protection against cheap imports.
There is also an underlying aspect of the German steel industry which few
inside the country are prepared to face up to. 'The problem starts because
essentially the German steel industry has not restructured in about the last
30 years. That is unique in Europe,' says Mr Jeremy Fletcher, an independent
strategic steel analyst. It may be technologically efficient, but it has
remained fragmented.
He suggests two reasons: first, because the customer base (above all, the
automotive industry) kept expanding; and second, because Germany did not opt
for nationalisation, inter-company restructuring was made more difficult,
especially as there is no tradition of hostile takeovers in the system.
Last year's shotgun wedding between Krupp and Hoesch was the first big move
towards restructuring. In spite of reassurances to the contrary, it now
looks certain to cost thousands of jobs.
There is no doubt that the survivors are hoping against hope that
Klockner-Werke will fail in its bid to write off 40 per cent of its debts,
currently under negotiation with its creditors. Closing down its 3.35m
tonnes production would be a step towards the relief of the industry.
Meantime, Thyssen, Krupp and Saarstahl are talking urgently about
'co-operation' in the long products market. Industry sources say they must
reach agreement within a month, or fall back on in-house solutions: more
capacity cuts. Mr Cromme can scarcely wait. He has already announced the
probable closure of Krupp's long products plants at Siegen and Hagen, unless
they can win a last-minute reprieve from those negotiations.
Yet German steel men defend themselves against charges that they have failed
to restructure. They have just done it a different way, they say. 'We have
diversified, and built up other pillars for our companies to survive on, if
they have to abandon steel,' says one.
Which is precisely why Mr Kriwet and Mr Cromme can make their threats to
pull out altogether, with more than a grain of truth about them. They just
might.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Personal View: How to cure an industry's ills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The European steel industry is in a state of crisis. Western European steel
companies are losing large amounts of money, operating with historically low
prices, experiencing low-capacity utilisation and are involved in trade
skirmishes with North America and eastern Europe. The eastern European steel
industry, like other heavy industries in the east, is struggling to identify
the appropriate structure, scale and operating formula for the future under
free-market capitalism.
This 'state of crisis' has brought vociferous requests for support from
Community and state institutions to aid restructuring: reductions of 30m
tonnes of capacity and 50,000 employees are commonly mentioned.
Conditions in western Europe echo those in the late 1970s and early 1980s
which resulted in a declaration of 'manifest crisis' in the industry and the
famous Davignon plan. This plan was to solve the problem of capacity and to
produce a healthy industry; even as late as 1990, industry leaders were
proclaiming its success. Current cries for help raise fundamental questions:
is there overcapacity in the industry and will its elimination result in a
healthy industry? The answer to the first question is yes, but to the second
is no, unless the industry also adopts a different approach to technology,
cost structure and capital investment.
If overcapacity is reduced now, there may well be under-supply when demand
next peaks. This will lead to new capacity being introduced, replicating the
problem through the next business cycle. Any 'overcapacity' is a symptom of
a disease rather than the underlying cause. The causes can be found by
examining why the steel industry is not capable of making a profit during
this recession.
Integrated steel manufacturers, those using blast-furnace technologies, have
cost 70 per cent fixed and 30 per cent variable. With volumes 20 to 30 per
cent off their peak and prices similarly depressed, losses are made. The
industry is also over-invested. Investment in the last 20 years has
concentrated on modernising technology, increasing the asset to sales ratio,
the proportion of fixed costs and assets in downstream activities such as
galvanising. These investments have pushed the 'overcapacity' from an
earlier to a later stage in the process, on a higher fixed asset base.
Despite a history of cyclicality and limited demand growth, the industry has
invested 30 per cent more than depreciation over the last 12 years.
So how has this progression into a high fixed-cost structure and
over-investment come about? A large percentage of the industry is still
state-owned: Usinor-Sacilor in France, Ilva in Italy, Ensidesa and AHV in
Spain. In the recent past even some of the now private sector companies were
state-owned, such as British Steel. Governments and EC institutions have
provided capital to facilitate the industry's 'modernisation'. These
investments have not been governed by return on investment, except by those
companies which have had the discipline of private sector shareholders.
There is no technological necessity for this over-investment and overly
fixed-cost structure. Many steel companies, notably the mini-mills, have
survived, prospered and returned profits even in the most vicious economic
climates. They have invested in technologies with cost structures that are
70 to 80 per cent variable, and in technologies which are significantly less
capital-intensive, often by a factor of 1:4. This accounts for their health
and the integrated industry's disease. The integrated industry has a growing
plethora of technology options available to it to achieve these costs and
asset objectives. Cheap capital is a cause of the illness, not its cure.
So what will create health in the European industry? The overriding need is
the operation of commercial rules on the allocation of capital to the steel
industry. This will probably be achieved only when there are no significant
assets remaining in state ownership, when plants are less integrated in
nature and when the EC ignores cries for help.
The introduction of capital market disciplines will result in a reversal of
the traditional fixed-cost structure to a more highly variable one and to
lower asset intensity. This will enable the steel industry to operate at or
above break-even in the worst economic climates.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Mr Mulroney's political legacy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRIAN Mulroney is bowing out as Canada's leader essentially for one
reason: to give his Conservative party a sporting chance of retaining power
in the general election later this year. His unpopularity had become so
overwhelming, and so apparently immutable, that its chances of winning with
him at its head were generally rated negligible.
Why is Mr Mulroney so unpopular? Mainly because he has been in power for
eight years, the last few of which have coincided with the longest and
deepest recession in Canada's postwar history. Most of the causes of the
recession lay well outside the prime minister's control, but his policies
have been perceived by many Canadians as making things worse rather than
better. That is almost certainly unfair. It is hardly likely that Canadians
in general would be better off if trade barriers had been left in place
between their economy and that of the US and no attempt had been made to
reform their tax and social security systems. These reforms - the free trade
agreements with the US and Mexico especially - may well turn out to have
laid the foundation for a new era of Canadian prosperity.
The Conservative party intends, in fact, to continue Mr Mulroney's policies,
while hoping that a new leader can escape the odium so firmly attached to
his name and personality. But such a leader may not be easy to find.
Novelty will no doubt be an advantage in itself, as it was for Mr John Major
when he succeeded Mrs Margaret Thatcher. But the Canadian political system,
with its federal constitution, its pronounced regional differences, and
above all its linguistic divide, is more complicated than the British. Not
the least of Mr Mulroney's achievements has been to hold the federation
together, during a period which has seen three federal states in Europe
break up.
To compare Canada with Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union may seem far-fetched;
with Czechoslovakia perhaps a little less so. A bi-national state, in which
the two nations are far from evenly balanced, is almost by definition a
difficult one to manage. The Czechoslovak example shows that democracy is as
likely to drive them apart as to keep them together; that divorce is not
synonymous with violent conflict; and that relations between the partners
are not necessarily easier after divorce than before it. All three lessons
merit Canadian contemplation.
Although Mr Mulroney's attempts at a negotiated constitutional compromise
both foundered - the Meech Lake accord unratified by the western provinces,
the Charlottetown one rejected in a referendum - his efforts, and his
personal roots in Quebec, did help secure a tacit and grudging consent from
the Quebecois to the maintenance of the federation as a lesser evil. It even
seems that, since last October's referendum, some of the heat has gone out
of that issue. There is a danger that the leadership struggle and the
general election may revive it.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Keating's move
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, yesterday set out his
platform of new health, childcare and other welfare policies in a bid to
hold on to power at next month's general elections. At this point such a
record fifth term looks like a long shot for a party which has been 10 years
in power, in a country with 1m on the unemployment register. Certainly, the
indications are that the Labor party is trailing significantly behind the
conservative opposition parties, with 42 per cent to 49 per cent in the
opinion polls.
The question which has yet to be answered is whether Mr Keating has improved
his chances by his proposal to place the future of Australia's constitution
at the centre of the election campaign. For some time Mr Keating has been
advocating the idea that Australia should break away from its dependence on
the British monarchy as head of state. Now he has undertaken to hold a
referendum on whether Australia should become a republic by the year 2001.
Traditionalists in Britain will no doubt be indignant at Mr Keating's
republicanism. He has caused them to be indignant before, for example during
the Queen's visit to Australia last year, when he appeared to touch her
person when guiding her at a public ceremony. He has also sought to have the
British flag removed from the top corner of the Australian flag, the Queen's
head removed from the new ADollars 5 bank note, and the Queen's name from
the oath of allegiance of new Australian citizens.
The indignation of the traditionalists misses the fact that the republican
debate in Australia goes back to the crisis of 1975, when the then
governor-general, Sir John Kerr, dismissed the Labour prime minister, Gough
Whitlam, on the grounds that the government's finances were blocked by the
opposition parties in the senate.
The crisis caused great anger in the Labor party, and fevered controversy
over whether Sir John had the constitutional authority to act as he did. But
the deeper question underlying the crisis was whether it was right that an
action of that kind should be taken by the representative of a distant
monarch.
Australia's constitutional arrangements can only be satisfactorily settled
by Australians, and if they were to decide that Australia should become a
republic, that must be their prerogative. A referendum would be an
appropriate method of clarifying the issue.
Australians may well feel that the present system is an anomaly. Their
country is a long way from Britain and has different interests. The
essential case for constitutional monarchy is that it provides continuity,
stability and non-partisan influence above the hurly-burly of politics. It
is not obvious that such a role can be played satisfactorily by a
governor-general who is notionally the representative of the Queen, but who
is really a former party politician appointed by his own side.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Airtours bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S competition policy has been badly dented by Mr Michael
Heseltine's decision not to refer the hostile bid by Airtours for Owners
Abroad to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
His motives in rejecting the recommendation of the director-general of fair
trading to refer the bid to the MMC are unclear. It is also the second time
in a month that Mr Heseltine has challenged the judgment of the independent
regulator that particular mergers raise competition issues which the MMC
should consider. This unwelcome return to political interference in
competition policy is bad for business and damaging to good government.
It is bad for business because it makes competition policy less predictable.
Companies involved in mergers or acquisitions are invited to seek
confidential advice in advance from the Office of Fair Trading on whether
competition issues will be raised. If the OFT's judgment is later overruled
by the politicians, predictability is weakened.
In this case, the secretary of state has set aside the director-general's
recommendation with only the briefest of standard press releases. This says
that Mr Heseltine 'considered on balance that the competition issues raised
by the merger were not sufficient to justify reference'.
Yet if the regulator feels that the competition issues justify referral,
then surely the bid should be referred. The Monopolies Commission, after
all, was created specifically to adjudicate on such matters. It would have
examined the arguments for and against in far greater depth than the
Department of Trade and Industry can. And it would have published a detailed
report setting out the reasons for its conclusions.
No such light is cast when the secretary of state overrides the advice of
the director-general as he did yesterday. And when politicians intervene in
this way, there is always the danger that they will be susceptible to
lobbying by sectional interests. The best protection against such covert
influence is to leave these controversial decisions to independent bodies
such as the OFT and the MMC.
Prima facie, there was a strong case for referral of the bid to the MMC. If
the bid succeeds, it will create a duopoly, with Thomson and Airtours
accounting for some two-thirds of package tour sales. It would also
exacerbate the trend towards vertical integration: the two biggest tour
operators would control three of the UK's charter airlines and almost a
third of package tour sales. There remains a risk that dominant groups will
discriminate against new entrants by, for example, denying them access to
charter capacity at peak times and refusing to sell their products when
demand is weak.
Now that the Airtours bid has been given the go-ahead, the monopolies
commission should be asked to examine the package tour business in depth.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Measures to ensure the prompt publication of macro-economic data are at
the heart of the CSO's recently announc-ed package of improved dissemination
practices. In many instances publication times will be advanced
significantly. The first estimate of quarterly gross domestic product, for
example, will be brought forward by four weeks.
There is and has been no question of CSO 'sitting on' results. There has to
be a short gap between our receiving information and publishing it, so that
CSO can add to its value. For example, data have to be aggregated, grossed
up, seasonally adjusted and, most importantly, checked for accuracy and
consistency. As Mr Davies says (Letters, February 24), this type of
statistical information is price-sensitive and important to industry; it has
to be released responsibly.
It is simply not true that information on the latest retail price index is
held back for two weeks; only the broadest of indications about the
all-items index is available at that time, and this is based on partial
information. The concept of a real-time RPI is interesting, and may be
technically possible. But it would not be possible to collect in this way
the same range of items included in the current, monthly RPI, which of
necessity covers practically all the goods and services people buy.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The Augustinian virtues we need
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Simple horror at the size of prospective UK budget deficits is not a
sufficient reason for adopting restrictive fiscal policies this year. Horror
of government deficits was never the reason why I abandoned card-carrying
Keynesianism - that is the doctrine of stoking up demand until some full
employment target is achieved. The budget of a country is not the same as
that of an individual or a company, despite some partial analogies.
A so-called theorem, frequently put forward, is that, whenever the real rate
of interest exceeds a country's real growth rate, any primary budget deficit
must, if continued, cause the burden of interest payments to explode. (By
'primary' is simply meant the deficit excluding interest payments.) It is
this argument that lies behind the fear of a debt trap and the Maastricht
criterion limiting permissible budget deficits (not clearly defined) to 3
per cent of gross domestic product.
The seven UK 'wise men', who have just reported to the Treasury, range in
their projections of the UK public sector borrowing requirement over the
next couple of years from Pounds 32bn to Pounds 60bn, or 4.9 to 8.2 per cent
of GDP.
The remarks of the seven economists on the overall functioning of the
economy are, however, more interesting than their best guesses about the
level of various indicators in the next couple of years. Indeed I was
delighted to find some common ground with Prof Wynne Godley of Cambridge in
his arguments against an early tax rise or public spending curb.
The view that prospective UK budgets are explosive, and will have to be
curbed soon, would be reasonable if the economy were operating at the normal
rate of utilisation possible without accelerating inflation, and growing at
its trend rate. But this is not the case.
Even if some modest recovery has begun, UK growth is well below its 2-3 per
cent trend rate; and the Bank of England, in its Inflation Report, puts the
output gap - the degree to which demand increases could readily be absorbed
by producers without adding inflationary pressures - at between 2 1/2 per
cent and 7 per cent of GDP. This is equivalent to between one and three
years' normal growth.
The 'theorem' about the debt trap applies in full only if the level of
output is independent of budgetary policy. If higher public spending or
lower taxes cause output to grow more quickly, then the theorem does not
hold. Debt interest rises, but so does the real national income and
government revenues with it.
In a mathematical appendix, composed with a colleague, Prof Bob Rowthorn,
Godley demonstrates that, on certain strong assumptions 'so long as there is
no supply constraint of any kind, an addition to public expenditure would
eventually add enough to national output to generate enough tax revenue - at
given tax rates - to cover not only the initial addition to public
expenditure, but also the interest payments which have been generated by the
additional public sector debt'.
Left to myself, I would merely say, as I did in this column on January 28,
that, even if there is any increase in the transfer burden from servicing
the national debt, this must be balanced against the welfare gains from
higher output and employment.
Godley also has a less abstract argument. The surpluses and deficits of the
various sectors must add up to zero. Let us assume, as a worst case, a PSBR
equivalent to 9 per cent of GDP and a current balance of payments deficit of
4 per cent. Then the arithmetical implication is that of a private sector
surplus of 5 per cent of GDP.
Yet surpluses of this kind have only been approached in the past in periods
of very high inflation such as the 1970s. The only reason for expecting them
now is that corporate and personal saving will for several years remain
exceptionally high relative to investment to work off the debt overhang.
Meanwhile, 'it would be perverse in the extreme to respond to this
exceptionally low private spending relative to income by fiscal
restriction'.
No one who remembers Godley's previous doom warnings on fiscal imbalance
will expect him to grant British taxpayers an indefinite reprieve. But the
Godley point with which I agree is that the time for restrictive fiscal
measures will come when the economy is up against some constraint such as
the balance of payments, accelerating inflation or a shortage of capacity or
labour.
I would, however, go much further than Godley in collapsing these three
constraints into one - that of accelerating inflation. Operationally we
would know we were up against a balance of payments constraint if the
exchange rate fell intolerably or interest rates had to be raised sharply to
prevent this happening. But the only reason for worrying about the exchange
rate is that it is part of the inflationary transmission mechanism.
As far as capacity is concerned, the relevant constraints are not purely
physical, but signs that domestic pressures are pushing up pay and prices.
As the very wide range in the Bank of England's output gap estimate
demonstrates, we cannot know beforehand what the safety limits are. In the
past inflation has started to accelerate even when unemployment has been in
the low millions.
I would not reject out of hand Prof Patrick Minford's view that, because of
the Thatcher government's supply side improvements, the equilibrium level of
unemployment is now down to 1m. But nor would I bank on it in advance.
What would be the main grounds for rejecting the Augustinian view of the UK
fiscal balance - 'God make me chaste, but not just yet'? There is the
extreme neo-classical view that, whatever the chancellor does, tax increases
will be expected by businessmen and consumers and they will adjust their
savings upwards accordingly. In that case delaying tax increases would do no
good, but no harm either.
There is also the ultra-monetarist view that only monetary policy - in
practice interest rates - and not fiscal policy matters for demand
management. But we would have to be extremely confident that only money
matters to disregard the effects of fiscal tightening altogether, especially
when business and consumer confidence remain so fragile.
Another consideration is the anxiety mentioned by the Bank of England that
future deficits might be financed by excessive borrowing from the banking
system and thus stoke up inflation. Fears that fiscal tightening will not
take place when the right time comes cast their shadows in front of them.
Examples are high bond yields and a low sterling exchange rate. To forestall
such fears, Mr Lamont would be well advised to give unorthodox advance
warning of the direction of likely future tax increases and expenditure
curbs.
The final bogey is the 1981 Budget, which raised the tax burden in a
recession, which in turn provoked a protest by 364 economists, but for which
Conservatives active in the period are fighting to claim credit. Because the
economy was, in any case, about to revive substantially the 1981 Budget did
little harm, but little good either. Can one be sufficiently confident of
expansion prospects this time - or the feasibility of further large interest
rate cuts - to risk an early dose of fiscal restriction this time round?

<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Cassell restates much conventional wisdom which, in my
experience, is fundamentally flawed. There are bad payers and would-be
non-payers who warrant heavy-handed letters or nocturnal telephone calls,
but these are a minority.
Most customers expect to pay for goods and services received, and payment
delays are largely supplier caused. Over time I have developed an approach
to improving cash collection performance based on this premise and its
validity is consistently demonstrated by the results achieved. Recently this
was done to dramatic effect (debt more than 60 days old reduced by 95 per
cent) for a company operating in an overcrowded market. In the international
programme I am now leading, my experiences have been similar to those I had
in the UK.
If suppliers take steps to implement efficient internal processes, not just
in the credit department but throughout the sale and supply process, and
manage customer relationships effectively, they can largely eliminate the
causes of significantly overdue debt. This is not down to finance alone.
Success requires the chief executive to secure commitment to the objective
across the full spectrum of the organisation.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From CAROLINE DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Cassell's article on the appalling economic implications of the
now universal practice of late payment of bills ('The dangers that lurk in
delay', February 23) concentrates on large 'small' businesses and lacks
constructive suggestions for reform.
The full dimensions and tragedy of the crisis are even greater than he
suggests. The Financial Times should be directing its spotlight towards the
many thousands of individuals who have lost their jobs in the current
recession and who are valiantly trying to set up new businesses, often on
their own or with just a few others.
Their efforts are being fatally undermined by the fact that they are not
being paid for their products or services. It is now impossible for these
new entrepreneurs to construct realistic or dependable cash flow
projections. They are forced to devote a ridiculous and disproportionate
amount of time chasing long overdue money. This is not a creative way of
spending time and energy. Many trickles of economic regeneration are thus
being stopped before they can even reach the main flow of business activity.
As for reforms, I suggest that we need: a national monitoring system
(statistics are urgently required); a nationally accepted payment schedule,
with penalties clearly set out; quicker and more flexible court procedures;
and an immediate full-scale government campaign against delayed payments.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Letter: Criticism obscures complex issues faced by UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAN ELIASSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Nicholas Hinton (Personal View, February 5) is right to be concerned
about the international response to the massive humanitarian emergencies of
the last two years. But his condemnation of the United Nations agencies is
way off the mark and obscures one of the most complex issues facing the
world today.
Humanitarian crises caused by drought or natural disaster are difficult
enough to address in most developing countries. But the crises Mr Hinton
focuses on - not least the former Yugoslavia and Somalia - are infinitely
harder to deal with, as these are rooted in complex and violent political
conflicts. In these crises, it is mainly the Security Council, and not
United Nations agencies, which has the key role in mustering international
resolve and support to bring an end to the conflict, and create an
environment in which humanitarian assistance can be delivered.
The Security Council has, in fact, made a number of historic decisions in
these crises. In Somalia, the council's actions - which included the
deployment of 30,000 international troops - have enabled the international
community to provide substantial relief from violence and hunger.
The troop deployment of December yielded immediate results largely because
UN agencies, along with the International Committee of the Red Cross and
non-governmental organisations, had been striving for some time to establish
emergency relief operations in Somalia. And this was done in an environment
so hostile that relief workers themselves were targeted by warring factions.
Contrary to Mr Hinton's assertions, the secretary-general is undertaking
restructuring measures designed to make the UN more responsive to today's
global challenges, including the need to provide effective emergency
humanitarian assistance.
UN agencies are also seeking new and imaginative ways to improve their
humanitarian response capacity, including the involvement of
non-governmental organisations in humanitarian strategies. But a much wider
effort, with the active support of member states, is needed to establish
effective mechanisms for limiting the human suffering caused by the kind of
bitter, largely ethnic, strife now sweeping the globe.
Mr Hinton's criticism belies the complexity and the dilemma which the UN
faces today. Too many of our staff have sacrificed their lives in the
struggle to provide relief to the helpless for anyone to believe that the UN
does not take its humanitarian responsibilities seriously. Indeed, the UN's
relevance in this new international environment will, in large measure, be
determined by how it discharges those responsibilities.

PREPARING FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY By Paul Kennedy, Ramdon House, New
York, Dollars 25
Forget hopes that the coming century will be an era of peaceful prosperity.
A near doubling of the world's population over the next 50 years - to a
mind-boggling 10bn people - threatens to overwhelm other more benign trends,
such as the collapse of communism and the growth of an integrated,
market-oriented global economy. The population explosion will degrade the
world's environment, perhaps fatally, and confront fragile islands of
privilege, such as Europe and the US, with a tidal wave of migrants from the
dirty, impoverished and overcrowded third world.
Paul Kennedy's sombre tone is somewhat surprising. The British-born Yale
historian gained worldwide attention with his 1987 best-seller, The Rise and
Fall of the Great Powers. This argued that the US was losing its grip as the
world's top nation and would eventually go the same way as Ming China,
Philip II's Spain and Victorian Britain. But although Kennedy argued that a
change in the pecking order of nations was inevitable, he gave no hint of a
threat to global prosperity.
The boring part of Kennedy's new book is a rather uninspired effort to
update his earlier assessment of the economic and political outlook for the
great powers. But he makes up for this with an ambitious attempt to analyse
the deeper trends - demographic, environmental and technological - that
underpin the fortunes of all nations. He claims to identify trends so bleak
as 'to induce despair'. He wonders whether human social organisations may
not now be simply 'unequal to the challenges posed by overpopulation,
environmental damage, and technology-driven revolutions . . .'
Historically, prophets of doom have a poor track record. At the end of the
18th century, Thomas Malthus, an English clergyman, published his famous
essay on population predicting chronic famine and economic catastrophe. He
was spectacularly wrong. As he was writing, the English industrial
revolution - the greatest technological leap in human history - was
gathering momentum. Britain's population increased fourfold during the 19th
century - confirming Malthus's worst fears - but stunning gains in
productivity led to a fourteenfold increase in national product. Instead of
starving, Britain ended up richer than anybody had imagined possible.
Kennedy believes the global economy is now poorly placed to cope with a
similar Malthusian threat, albeit on an incomparably larger scale. The
world's population, having increased from less than 1bn in Malthus's day to
about 2bn in the 1930s and more than 5bn today, may nearly double again
before stabilising late in the 21st century.
For Kennedy, it is 'inconceivable that the world can sustain a population of
10bn people devouring resources at the rate enjoyed by the richer societies
today - or even half that rate'. The problem is not just the changed scale
of the population threat (the world is adding a quarter of a billion mouths
every three years, rather than every 75 years), but also the alarming
geographical mismatch between demographic pressures and technological
resources.
Britain defied Malthus's predictions because the population and technology
explosions took place simultaneously in the same society. There was also the
escape valve of migration: during the 19th century 20m people left Britain
for underpopulated regions such as the US and the Antipodes. Today's
demographic explosion is occurring exclusively in developing countries
whereas the technological advances are taking place in rich, advanced
countries where birth rates are falling. Poor countries thus lack access to
the technologies that might save them.
Short of a far more ambitious effort by industrialised countries to promote
third-world development, Kennedy thus foresees a horribly unstable future.
The already yawning gap in living standards between the advanced industrial
democracies and developing nations is set to grow steadily wider.
Environmental problems will intensify. And affluent nations, surrounded by a
heaving mass of impoverished humanity, will face enormous pressures to relax
immigration controls.
Kennedy's book is thought-provoking but perhaps unnecessarily pessimistic.
His 1987 analysis of the economic and political fortunes of the great powers
was compelling because he was able to exploit his considerable historical
expertise. In this new book, he has branched out into fields - such as the
environment and technology - in which he is much less expert.
He shows no sign, for example, of having digested the World Bank's recent
work on sustainable development. The bank argues that rapid growth in the
third world need not pose unmanageable environmental problems, provided
countries adopt clean technologies and use price mechanisms to curb
polluters. The bank may be wrong but Kennedy fails to show why.
Kennedy's previous book, moreover, amply demonstrates the limitations of
futurology. Like most observers, he failed to anticipate either the collapse
of communism or the acceleration of moves towards economic and monetary
union in western Europe. He also, as he tacitly concedes in his new book,
exaggerated the relative economic decline of the US.
Yet Kennedy deserves credit for tackling big and important issues. His book
is an antidote to the excessive optimism of analysts who argue that the end
of communism and revived faith in market forces must result in a brighter
future. With most western politicians absorbed by relatively trivial
domestic concerns, he is correct to identify unchecked population growth as
the principal source of misery in the world and the greatest potential
threat to global stability in the 21st century.

Sir, The report from the electricity industry regulator ('Regulator deals
blow to coal lobby', February 23), is the latest analysis which may drive us
to conclude that the Department of Trade and Industry's response to the Coal
Board's pit closure proposals was correct. Perhaps the question now is the
political price to be paid for the Coal Board's flouting its obligations on
consultation.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Arts: Cosi fan tutte and Falstaff - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest season of English Touring Opera, launched this week at Sadler's
Wells, joins last autumn's novelty, a Falstaff directed by Tim Hopkins, to a
brand new Cos fan tutte. The Cos is the work of Claire Venables, her second
staging for the company (she produced Albert Herring during its previous
incarnation as Opera 80) and her third venture into Mozart.
The Cos promised much. Colleagues have spoken highly of the Venables Magic
Flute (for Opera Northern Ireland) and Figaro (for Norrlandsoperan in
Sweden), and certainly the short essay which she contributed to the ETO
programme suggested a serious examination of just what the opera is about:
'I am curious to test,' she writes, 'whether the opera is telling us that it
is actually possible to fall in love with anybody. If this is the case it
means everybody is loveable and can be loved. Once we grasp that. We can
then choose whom to love.'
Somewhere in that testing process, though, things seem to have gone
seriously awry. The staging begins promisingly. Idit Nathan's designs fix it
firmly in an art school where the lovers are fellow students and Alfonso
their jaded teacher; the women's class is adorned with male icons, the men's
with ideals of femininity.
Through the first act art and reality are gradually melded together: as the
men go off to war Alfonso evokes 18th-century military imagery, scrawling
'Love equals Death' across an easel while they make their farewells; Despina
illustrates her views on men with Cagnacci's The Rape of Lucretia and
Manet's Olympia. The lovers' portraits are caught on Polaroid, and when the
strangers appear they are decked out as Laurel and Hardy, or perhaps, in
this context, Gilbert and George.
The effect of all this is to disorientate rather than to engage. Apart from
the unfailing invention of Jeremy Sams's witty English text, the only common
denominator is a low-grade knockabout humour. Once real life has been thrown
out of the window (literally in the second act as the set begins to crumble
away too) nothing is left to pull together the threads in the finale.
Whatever the mise en scene for a Cos, the emotions have to be credible, the
moral dilemmas real; Venables does not begin to make a dramatic case to
match her own manifesto.
Ivor Bolton nevertheless conducted briskly and with a good deal of stylish
wit, and the performances of Julie Unwin as a feisty and always watchable
Dorabella and Charles Johnston's cool Alfonso in particular followed him
well. Andrew Burdon's Ferrando was forthright and Meurig Davies, apparently
under the weather as Guglielmo, gained steadily in power and confidence;
Catherine Pierard, though, seemed badly miscast as Fiordiligi. Eleanor
Bennett's engaging Despina began with a strong Scottish accent and then
allowed it to deconstruct, along with everything else in the production.
The Falstaff by contrast is both consistently fascinating and coherent, even
though it may not be to all tastes. The curtain rises on a Garter Inn that
would serve for a production of Wozzeck or Die Soldaten; Falstaff and his
cronies drink alone in bare claustrophobic cubicles, harshly lit; Dr Caius
appears to have come straight out of Nosferatu, Bardolph and Pistol from an
unnamed Buchner drama. None of the later images is so striking, but
Hopkins's production (designs by Peter J. Davison) never quite loses that
formalising element of mannered expressionism.
Even if the result does not celebrate Verdi's glorious affirmations as
wholeheartedly as it could (the final scene is very hard to mould into this
concept) everything works; there is a discipline about the proceedings and a
refusal to go for the easy jokes that is refreshing and revealing. Its one
big miscalculation is to treat Ford's deeply serious outburst in the second
act (well sung by Patrick Donnelly) with such levity, losing a precious
element in the opera's miraculously balanced scheme of feelings.
The cast maintains the dramatic consistency. Jonathan Velra's Falstaff seems
less concerned with concepts of chivalry than with personal integrity and,
in the end, with just getting through. He delivers all his music with a
salutary straightforwardness; Amanda Holden's fine, relaxed translation is
always easy to catch. There is a deft and nimble Alice Ford from Margaret
Preece, a cutely pointed Mistress Quickly from Marie Walshe, and a
small-toned but engaging Nannetta from Gaynor Morgan. Charles Peebles
conducts without unnecessary rhetoric. It is well worth catching somewhere
during the spring.

LORENZO'S OIL (12) George Miller
HONEYMOON IN VEGAS (12) Andrew Bergman
LEON THE PIG FARMER (15) Vadim Jean and Gary Sinyor
UNDER SIEGE (15) Andrew Davis
ROMPER STOMPER (18) Geoffrey Wright
Soaring crane shots; music by Verdi and Bellini; heraldic frenzies of colour
co-ordination; lighting that crosses Rembrandt with Delacroix. Lorenzo's Oil
takes the kind of subject usually reserved for the small screen - a
true-life tale of family heroism fighting illness and medical bigotry - and
nearly bursts a blood vessel trying to inflate it for the large.
In this 136 minutes of operatic dementia from director George 'Mad Max'
Miller, a small but radiant seam of truthfulness is provided by Susan
Sarandon. She plays Michaela Odone, mother of the ALD-suffering child who
gave his name to the rapeseed-derived medication of the title. ALD -
Adrenoleukodystrophy - struck five-year-old Lorenzo in Washington DC in
1983. The disease, which damages the brain via the nerve system, might have
terminated the boy soon after but for the cure-seeking tenacity of his
mother and father Augusto (played by a Nick Nolte involved in his own
life-or-death struggle with an Italian accent).
Michaela and Augusto, hacking through a jungle of 'triglycerides,'
'myelinations' and 'C24/26' fatty acids, finally stumbled on a clearing in
the form of a simple vegetable oil sent for synthesising to a veteran
British biochemist. The said boffin, Don Suddaby, plays himself in the film
and is - no disrespect - a hoot. His walnut face and diffident Northern
burr, at bay amid the Hollywood test tubes, belong in a different movie from
the house-style hyperboles of director Miller, who has not come down to
earth from his last American film The Witches Of Eastwick.
Lorenzo's Oil begins con molto espressione - baroque cathedral ceiling
behind credits, opera booming from Nolte's car radio, hospital corridors lit
like celestial travel brochures - and then moves into maestoso con total
overkill.
A theoretically touching human story, lashed forward by this laying-on of
styles, needs a gentling hand from the actors but gets it only from
Sarandon. She wraps the role so tenderly and completely around herself that
we are engulfed by every close-up. Watch her face as it flickers with fear
and choked-back grief at the first bad news from the doctor. Or watch that
face open like a plant to sunlight at the first hints of recovery from
Lorenzo.
The rest of the cast struggle to keep up. Peter Ustinov is woolly and
unfocused as Professor Nikolais, the family's helper-hinderer from the
medical establishment. And poor Nolte, wrestling with his Italian accent
like Laocoon with his snakes, has some wild moments of overacted or
overdirected emoting on dim-lit stairways and in brainstorming libraries.
Lorenzo's Oil, one surmises, is the right project fallen among the wrong
people. We should believe in the Odones as human beings first, tragic or
operatic paradigms second. And we should beware of any film in which the
stages of deadly illness are nudged forward by Maria Callas singing 'Casta
Diva' or by 'Una Furtiva Lagrima' coercing tears that should need no
coercion at all.
Watching Honeymoon In Vegas is like being dragged off on an unsolicited
holiday, with no time to pack or pleasurably anticipate, and then
discovering that one enjoys every minute. 'No, I don't want to go to Las
Vegas with Nicolas Cage]' - but we do. 'No, I don't want to go to Hawaii
with James Caan.' But when Mr Caan takes us there - he plays a mobster who
has won a weekend with Cage's fiancee Sarah Jessica Parker after humiliating
him at poker - we calm down, stop gibbering and enjoy ourselves.
Film-maker Andrew Bergman wrote Blazing Saddles and wrote/directed The
In-Laws and The Freshman: films in which a touch of frantic went with the
funny. Honeymoon In Vegas is his operation yet. It begins with suave
hilarity in New York, where the world's worst private eye (Cage) copes with
adultery paranoiacs who suppose their wives are sleeping with Mike Tyson. In
Vegas - Cage and Parker jet there for a whirlwind wedding - life is a
sweetly obstructive chaos of gambling disaster, Elvis impersonator
conventions and charming con men. Then the chase is on as Cage crosses seas
and continents to retrieve the prettily twittering Miss P.
Pleasures of the journey include Peter Boyle as a Hawaian chief who can sing
all of South Pacific and almost does; a fussy man buying a ticket at an
airline counter (funniest off-wall vignette since the art gallery scene in
Beverly Hills Cop); and - well, the list is agreeably long, and so is the
charm-and-comedy mileage Bergman gets from the simple tale of a Caan-man
stealing a bird from a gelded Cage.
Every time I tut-tut in print over British cinema's tendency to whinge about
its need for subsidy, a small army of commentators gets purple with
indignation at me. Yet Leon The Pig Farmer was made by Vadim Jean and Gary
Sinyor on a tiny self-raised budget and went on to win the Best First Film
prize at Edinburgh and the International Critics Prize at Venice.
The moral is simple. Talent and determination find cash and win prizes.
While everyone else weeps and begs on the Arts Ministry doormat, Sinyor and
Jean have signed up a fee-deferring cast - Janet Suzman, Brian Glover, Gina
Bellman - and fashioned this cockeyed comedy about a young Jewish estate
agent (Mark Frankel) who discovers he is the product of artificial
insemination. Is his father not the London net-curtain tycoon David De
Keyser? No, he is the north-country pig farmer Brian Glover.
Hearing this news, the entire close-knit Jewish community rears up around
him - a veritable Kosher Nostra - offering outrage or sympathy. And the two
sets of parents, Keyser/Suzman and Glover/Connie Booth, meet at a
Yalta-style suburban conference where they swap accents in a diplomatic
hailstorm of 'Oy-veys' and 'Eeh, lads.'
Jewish film comedy, rampant in America, is virtually unknown in Britain. But
Leon essays the classic mixture of tribal self-deprecation  - like Woody
Allen, the film's hero tries to hide his yarmulka under a protective hail of
WASP wit or suavity - and surreal visions of human togetherness. Just as
Allen plucked Marshal McLuhan out of a movie queue, Frankel is approached by
total strangers in art galleries or petrol stations. In a global village
turned funny-terrifying gossip shop, they know all his problems and offer
instant advice.
In Under Siege Steven Seagal, the action star with the superglued frown,
plays a Navy cook aboard the battleship USS Missouri. One day a bunch of
terrorists come on board and take over the ship's nuclear arsenal. Seagal
tells them to go away, using the following means of expression: an automatic
rifle, a hunting knife, a bomb in a microwave, a private army of fellow
sea-salts still at liberty, and the ship's 16-inch guns. (The terrorists by
now are trying to escape in a submarine.)
I liked this film's insouciance. When the Pentagon calls Seagal by emergency
phone to ask how things are going, Seagal's girlfriend says 'He's in a
gunfight right now. I'll have to take a message.' And headbanded villain
Tommy Lee Jones has time to muse 'I miss the Sixties' between killing
people, having psychotic tantrums and trying to nuke Honolulu. Clean simple
fun, directed by Andrew Davis from a script by JF Lawton.
Why was the press-show print of Romper Stomper so hideous? Processed as if
in blue ink, it makes the 90 minutes of this shock-horror Australian tale of
neo-Nazi skinheads seem like 90 years. At best Geoffrey Wright's film, which
won a succes de scandale on last year's festival circuit, is a fitful thing:
part handheld docudrama of race hatred - the gang-warfare scenes are
violently effective - and part leaden-footed melodrama of romantic jealousy.
But if all London's distributors can offer is this blue-rinse eyesore, wait
for the video.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Arts: Impressions de Pelleas / Review of Peter Brook's
Debussy at Glasgow's Tramway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pelleas et Melisande was once believed to be the quintessence of a certain
type of operatic Frenchness, impossible to rend from gauzy stage settings
and 'impressionistic' musical readings, improperly uttered in any language
other than the original. In recent decades, as Debussy's opera has found its
widely accepted place among the essential masterpieces of the medium, the
process of translating it is no longer deemed either impossible or improper.
In this country Pelleas has had its score theatrically examined under
probing new lights, its play re-located, and its Maeterlinck text
successfully rendered in English.
Each important stage in the process has brought gain and also loss: this is
always the way with essential masterpieces. The latest is marked by Peter
Brook. His Impressions de Pelleas was first played at the end of last year,
in his Paris theatre, the Bouffes du Nord. It then set off on a European
tour which this week reached the Tramway Theatre, Glasgow (a performing
space favoured by Brook, where previously his Mahabharata and Tempete were
likewise given their only British showings).
The translation process is comparable to the one worked by Brook on Carmen a
decade ago. It involves a single setting (designed by Chloe Obolensky); an
unbroken long (100 minutes) act fashioned out of Debussy's five, with two
scenes cut and many nips and tucks (some of them puzzling) effected
elsewhere; multiple casting of principal roles; and removal of all small
ones. The main innovation is that the 'scoring' here, by Marius Consant, is
a reduction for two pianos - one on stage, one echoing it from the side.
The role of the first piano is extended, visually at least. For Impressions
de Pelleas is a Debussy re-location with a difference - to a
turn-of-the-century drawing room out of Matisse, complete with ochre-red
walls, goldfish bowl, orientally patterned carpet and bright chair-cloths;
only two front-stage pools of water suggest any external scenic elements. At
the start the drama is (as it were) announced as a play-reading for friends
grouped round the piano; out of this a 'real' performance develops, which at
the end gently subsides into its domestic pre-condition. So smooth is the
connecting of these dramatic lines newly interlaced with those basic to the
opera that the occasional moment of melodrama - Pelleas's death, fussily
handled - stands out the more starkly.
From all this Brook gains much that is poetically reverberant for his
Pelleas reading. It is partly physical: while the Tramway may not permit the
close focus of the (smaller) Bouffes du Nord theatre, the siting of
Obolensky's spare drawing-room properties in the midst of this wonderfully
rough, untamed theatre space achieves a quietly forceful new grip on the
opera's domestic intimacy and its other-worldliness, its modulations of
darkness and light - and, indeed, on the extraordinary, unrepeatable meshing
of all those states and conditions.
But mainly it is the style of dramatic enactment - candid, serene,
physically restrained yet emotionally intense - that restores something of
the Pelleas mystery sacrificed in too many recent 'new looks' at the opera.
Brook understands that a stripping-away of this sort can elicit a magical
new set of images, signs and symbols to play alongside and against those
already built into the text - a flutter of cloth replacing the games with
Melisande's hair, a darkly lit dialogue around the piano in lieu of the
cavern scene, little Yniold observing everything from beside his chair, a
dead hand trailing in a pool of water.
Because the staging is for the most part so exactly shaped and aimed, a
meaningful new Pelleas experience stirs luminously beneath the old. The main
loss is, of course, the orchestra, that containing vessel of Debussyan
colours, thoughts and feelings - although, once mental adjustments have been
made and preconceptions thrown aside, the constant evocation of the world of
Debussy melodies is itself a source of fascinating new insights. Also, the
very sureness of the domestic framing removes from the opera that
imaginative largeness of canvas that makes it 'about' rather more than just
a family tragedy.
But in Tuesday's opening performance the most significant disappointment -
the only one, in truth - was the discrepancy between the acting level and
the vocal. In the first cast the complete Debussyan balance of word, note
and gesture was achieved only by Roger Soyer's distinguished Arkel and the
pure, shining Melisande of the Korean soprano Jungwon Park (a slight,
beautiful figure of oriental apartness - Brook's alternating Melisandes are
Chinese and Japanese). The others, notably Jean-Francois Lapointe's
youthfully handsome Pelleas and Vincent le Texier's too youthfully handsome
Golaud, tended to blur their musical lines.

<TEXT>
This year Channel 4 has been taking an increased audience share: as much as
12 per cent, more than twice that claimed by all the satellite channels put
together. In peak hours C4 has always largely ignored its flaunted 'remit'
to offer something different and serve minorities, so that its share has
grown steadily, and when you consider peak time schedules like tonight's its
ratings success is scarcely suprising. Tim Hunkin's Secret Life Of ..
reveals why a lift doesn't fall even when the cables supporting it are cut
(8.30). Turning The Screws which follows (9.00) is Roger Graef's verite
documentary series ostensibly about Wandsworth Prison but really about
Graef's old passion: human communication. Those are followed by two of the
best comedies now on British television: Drop The Dead Donkey (10.00) set in
a television newsroom; and Whose Line Is It Anyway? (10.30) in which people
parade their powers of improvisation. Top those off with a repeat of the
original sixties' series of The Avengers (11.05) with Honor Blackman playing
Gale to Patrick Macnee's Steed, and you have a very competitive line-up
indeed.

FT  25 FEB 93 / People: Chilver pitches in
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Chilver describes kaolin as the 'supreme white mat-erial'; he has been
involved with mining the aluminium silicon compound through his 20-year
association with English China Clays.
Now, in his new role as chairman of RJB Mining, he will come increasingly
into contact with one of the better known black substances. RJB already runs
11 opencast coal sites and one deep mine.
The company is planning a stock market flotation, which is likely to value
it at more than Pounds 100m, and would like to buy some of the pits which
British Coal wants to close. It is also likely to be a bidder for at least
some parts of BC when it is privatised.
Introducing a company he heads to the stock market will be a new experience
for Lord Chilver, and that challenge, he says, was part of the appeal of the
RJB job. He has, however, considerable experience at the top of quoted
companies, having been a director at English China Clays since 1973 and
chairman since 1989. He has been a non-executive director of Imperial
Chemical Industries since 1990.
Richard Budge, RJB chief executive, says Lord Chilver was an obvious choice.
'He is an engineering specialist, having graduated in it and written about
it. As chairman of ECC, he is also used to big holes in the ground.'
RJB was the subject of a Pounds 106.5m management buy-out last year from AF
Budge, the private construction company headed by Tony Budge, the brother of
Richard, which went into receivership in December.

Foreign &amp; Colonial Eurotrust is reinforcing the continental European
representation on its board with the appointments of Detlef Bierbaum, a
partner of Cologne private banking house Sal Oppenheim, and Pedro Schwartz,
professor of economics at Madrid University.
'This is an active board, with a good input on strategy, and with plenty of
experience in the securities business. They are not sitting ducks,' says
Stephen White, manager of Eurotrust and a director of F&amp;C Management.
F&amp;C's Eurotrust has assets of Pounds 112m, and, as one of the top performers
in its sector, stands at a discount of just 2 per cent.
Bierbaum, 50, replaces Wolfgang Meissner, 62, who was at the same bank and
who is retiring in order to devote more time to his recently reacquired
family engineering business near Chemnitz in east Germany. While F&amp;C has
established a joint venture with Bayerische Hypo Bank, it says it also has a
long-standing dealing relationship with Sal Oppenheim, and has had one of
its bankers on the board continuously since the trust was set up in 1972.
Schwartz, formerly chief economist at brokers Iberagentes, is the first
director from a southern European country. An alumnus of the LSE, the
anglophile professor, who has two sons at Winchester, is a member of the
economics team of the Bank of Spain, and was a liberal MP for 15 years.
Philip Tose, chairman of Hong Kong-based Peregrine Investments, has been
made a director of Drayton Far Eastern Trust, a month after going on the
board of the trust's managers Invesco MIM, in which Peregrine has built a
24.7 per cent stake. The slightly larger trust Drayton Asia is the subject
of a bid from EFM Dragon Trust.
Invesco says Tose's role is as 'an investment professional, with very
specific expertise on the Hong Kong region'. Peter Knapton, managing
director of Invesco's UK wholesale business, also goes on to the board.
Geoffrey Bowling, an Invesco director who is retiring from the group, and
Nicholas Johnson, who resigned from Invesco at Christmas, both step down.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tom Mulcahy is to be appointed as the new group chief executive of Allied
Irish Banks, Ireland's largest clearing bank, succeeding Gerry Scanlan who
retires in February next year.
Mulcahy joined AIB in 1972 and since 1989 has been the group general manager
of its capital markets division, responsible for the group's corporate
finance, treasury, investment banking, stockbroking and international
operations. He previously served in senior corporate, international and
merchant banking posts in Dublin and London, setting up a merchant banking
arm in London in 1973. He was appointed a director of AIB in 1990.
He began his banking career in 1958 with National Bank, later to be
incorporated into the Bank of Ireland, and oversaw the acquisition of
Goodbody stockbrokers in 1990, one of the four main broking firms in Dublin.
He succeeded in getting the bank appointed as corporate finance adviser in
some of the principal acquisitions in the Irish market over the past year,
valued at some IPounds 250m.
Mulcahy, 51, was one of a number of strong candidates from within the bank.
Jerry Casey, the chief executive of AIB's US division whose subsidiary,
First Maryland Bancorp, has been performing particularly well - now
contributing 25 per cent of group profits - was thought to be high on the
shortlist.
Mulcahy is a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants and a fellow
of the Institute of Bankers.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Only the tenacious
need apply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS is a bad time time to be looking for a job in advertising. The
Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, estimates the number of jobs in
advertising agencies in Britain has collapsed from a peak of 15,000 in 1988
to 12,000 in 1992.
Redundancies have also taken their toll in the US advertising business,
according to Gary Billings, worldwide human resources director for the
agency Lintas Worldwide. Based in the US, Billings has responsibility for
the hiring and development of Lintas Worldwide's top executives.
'In New York, there has been something like a 25 per cent reduction in the
number of people working in advertising in the last five years and those are
people who will never re-enter the market again,' says Billings.
But although the number of jobs has shrunk, opportunities still exist. The
key is to spot them and improve chances of getting noticed.
One inescapable rule is to be persistent, says Billings. 'What it takes to
get the job is the skill you need to succeed in the job, and that's
tenacity. The probability of being in the right place at the right time to
get a job is a function of how many letters you have sent out. You make your
own luck; the person who is willing to send out hundreds of applications and
stick with it, is rare.'
Another key factor in advertising agencies' recruitment thinking is that,
just as their clients are increasingly shifting towards global marketing
strategies, so too agencies want to see evidence that new recruits are able
to function on a global basis.
'If you see yourself as a global advertising executive the opportunities are
greater, as long as you are willing to spend time in a developing economy,'
Billings adds.
A willingness to spend three years in the Shanghai office might mean lowered
pay expectations and tough working conditions. But such baptisms of fire
might, suggests Billings, lead to greater long-term success than simply
expressing a desire to dive headlong into a major account in a high-profile
office such as Paris or New York.
A checklist of requirements that an international agency looks for from new
recruits includes: an understanding of how global economies work and
interact; flexibility; enthusiasm; a realistic - that is, lowered -
expectation of pay levels; linguistic abilities.
But even more important, says Billings, 'Is that you have to be very good at
packaging and positioning yourself as a brand. That's true no matter where
you go. You must be realistic about time. It takes at least nine months
between starting to look and finding a job. Be patient and persistent. Never
waste a contact until you're ready. We're a networking business. When a
person is on the market, the first thing they do is start calling on the
network. But you must know exactly what your objective is before you sit
down with that contact.'
Nick Jones, 26, is British by birth but works for Lintas in New York on the
IBM account. His experience confirms that persistence and careful research
can give results. An English studies graduate, he went on to do an MBA at
Colorado State University.
'I applied for advertised jobs and also to US agencies directly, targeting
those where I felt I had something to offer. In my MBA I studied the
computer industry. When I saw that Lintas has pretty much all the IBM
advertising, I focused on Lintas. My interest in the IBM account, as it
turned out, coincided with the need for an assistant account executive.'
Jones believes he sent 60 speculative letters, from which he got two
interviews. 'You have to offer them (advertising agencies) a reason why you
would be good on a particular account. I don't think you can just say: 'I
want to work in advertising.' Everyone says that.'

FT  25 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Japan shuns the
western image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A few years ago a flick through Japanese television channels would have
revealed countless advertisements featuring smiling, blonde models.
Foreigners were even used to selling such typically Japanese products as
instant noodles. Today, however, you are more likely to find a home-grown
celebrity gently enjoying one of life's little pleasures.
Mykel Robey, an American who has been modelling in Japan for 13 years, says
he has recently noticed a sharp downturn in the demand for western models.
'The Japanese got smart and started looking at their own race and realised
that there were a lot of good-looking Japanese they could use for half the
price,' he says.
This growing sense of confidence in the Japanese identity is not based only
on physical changes. The phenomenon of the disappearing 'gaijin tarento'
(foreign entertainer or personality) in advertising is also attributed to
the collapse of the economic bubble of the late 1980s.
Akio Fukuoka, a creative director at Dentsu, the largest Japanese agency,
who in the past was responsible for ads using such well-known gaijin as
Arnold Schwarzenegger, says consumers now respond better to images they can
identify with, rather than fantasy figures. 'It seems that it is not
authentic to use a foreigner to convey a message of what is good for them,'
he says.
A Dentsu report on consumer trends for the 1990s is subtitled 'Seikatsu
nakushite, shohi nashi' (without life, there can be no consumption). Quality
of life is seen as the paramount consideration after the consumption drive
of the post-war decades.
Over the past year, television advertisements have typically become softer
and less strident. Colours are muted, music is gentler and products are
shown in the context of helping people to enjoy life, rather than working
till they drop.
One of Dentsu's most successful recent series of television ads has been a
long, low-key campaign for Kirin's Ichiban-shibori beer, using a well-known
actor in a variety of domestic situations and a quirky, catchy signature
tune. Each advert ends with the actor drinking some beer and saying
'Ureshii' ('I'm happy').
Some adverts have an aura of nostalgia for the old days, when life was less
complicated. In Japanese history, periods of sustained emulation of foreign
culture have often been followed by a period of cultural consolidation and
mild reaction against foreign influences.
On a small scale, something of the kind may be happening now. Dentsu's list
of hit products of 1992 includes old-fashioned fans and yukatas, the
traditional cotton robes worn to summer festivals or around the house. The
popularity of Sumo wrestling has boomed and a record number of people
visited shrines and temples to welcome in the New Year. Kimono makers are
hoping the popularity of traditional clothing will be given a further boost
by the wedding later this year of Crown Prince Naruhito.
In difficult economic times, Japanese consumers are finding comfort in
rediscovering their roots, according to Fukuoka. But he adds: 'If you ate
Japanese-style for 365 days, sometimes you would want to eat western food.'
Exotic locations and blue-eyed models are unlikely to have made a permanent
exit from Japanese TV screens, but their days of supremacy may be over.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Defying the
discounters - The OFT is crippling competition, argues William Bishop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM BISHOP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Colin Deas has a problem: Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair
trading, is trying to prevent him from competing effectively. Deas manages a
small, growing company called Rael Brook which manufactures high-quality
shirts. He is trying to build a reputation for his brand name and he has a
problem with discounters. Discounting upsets the high-street retailers who
give him wide distribution and whose stocking of his products helps him
build brand awareness. He decided Rael Brook's future was best served by
distributing only through high-street retailers and refusing to supply
discounters.
But soon the Office of Fair Trading began to pursue him, threatening him
with expensive legal action. Deas had no real choice: last week he
reluctantly agreed to resume supply to the complaining discounter. He is now
hoping the anger of the loyal high-street dealers will not lead to
destruction of the brand value he has worked hard to build.
Deas is not alone. At least four other companies have had similar problems.
Andrew Brownsword (greeting cards), TVR Engineering (sports cars), Anna
French (fabrics) and OIly's (children's wear) are small firms, with small
market shares, struggling to survive and grow in their respective market.
They have all during the last eight months been harried by the OFT. Each has
been made to sign an undertaking that interferes with its preferred methods
of distributing the products it makes.
This bizarre result has come about because of the Resale Prices Act of 1976
(re-enacting the original statute of 1964), which makes it unlawful for a
manufacturer to insist on minimum resale prices for his products. Only two
exceptions have been allowed - for books and some pharmaceuticals. This
statute probably accomplished something useful when first enacted, but today
is harmful to the public interest.
Resale price maintenance (RPM) is a paradoxical phenomenon. Why would any
manufacturer want dealers to keep the price of his product up? Lower prices
at retail normally mean greater sales for the manufacturer. Economists have
put forward three basic theories to explain why a manufacturer might want to
maintain resale prices: the dealer-cartel explanation, the
manufacturer-cartel explanation and the dealer-services explanation.
When the act was adopted, RPM was widespread in the UK. Some of it probably
was attributable to manufacturer cartels. All cartels suffer from the
problem of secret cheating by their members - Opec suffers from it all the
time. RPM may help a cartel to maintain price discipline because price
uniformity at the retail level makes it easier for other manufacturers to
detect secret 'cheating'. This is a problem only if there are few
manufacturers, each with a high market share.
Historically some RPM in the UK was attributable to the second explanation -
dealer cartels. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, groups of dealers
would threaten to boycott a manufacturer's product unless he imposed RPM on
all dealers. This was especially important where retail was dominated by
small shopkeepers organised in federations. In effect, they insisted
manufacturers act as their cartel agents, stamping out price-competing
retailers. Again, stopping this type of RPM is beneficial.
But today UK retailing is not dominated by federations of small inefficient
shopkeepers.
That leaves only one sensible interpretation: that these five companies are
buying valuable dealer services. A manufacturer who faces competition wants
his products distributed effectively. He wants his dealers to have the
incentive - by means of a healthy retail margin - to display and promote the
products. And he wants dealers to feel assured the value of their efforts
will not be taken away by discounters who have done nothing to promote the
product, yet who try to take the benefits of the promotional efforts of
others. Here the manufacturer needs RPM in order to stop the low-service,
cut-price discounter from getting something for nothing. Without RPM, his
dealer network will lack commitment and may even melt away.
UK government policy today is clear: it consistently favours major retailer
interests in preference to producer interests. In this respect, the UK is
more keen to regulate than even the European Commission, which has always
allowed selective distribution - often only a substitute for RPM.
Yet, as Michael Birkin of Interbrand has noted, the UK economy has failed in
recent decades to generate many new, world-famous brands, especially luxury
brands. Most luxury or high-quality items on sale in the UK are foreign. One
reason is that UK manufacturers cannot get started at home - as soon as they
create some brand awareness they are forced to supply discounters who erode
the brand value. Every single case recently pursued by the OFT falls into
this category. Significantly, the main UK instances of recent brand creation
(Laura Ashley, Body Shop, Crabtree &amp; Evelyn) control their own distribution.
Innovation in retailing is important, but so is product innovation. There is
no reason for UK law to favour retailers - or manufacturers either - the law
should be neutral and let free-market forces decide the balance.
The time has come to re-think the Resale Prices Act. It is probably no
longer necessary. Both dealer and manufacturer cartels can be dealt with
more effectively today under our general anti-cartel laws or by a Monopolies
and Mergers Commission investigation of problem industries. But even if the
act is still needed, there is a clear case for a general exemption in favour
of small firms. Then Sir Bryan and his staff could devote more of their
scarce resources to the useful work of reducing the disadvantages of cartels
and monopolies and less to the harmful work of making life difficult for
entrepreneurs such as Colin Deas.

The Know-How system seems to be the latest demonstration of the 'wheel of
reincarnation', which occurs every 10 to 20 years in the computer industry.
In the beginning, few people understood computers. Answers were sought from
'priests' in white coats. They composed the questions into arcane symbols,
presented them to the oracle and interpreted the results.
The PC revolution changed this. But as information technology spread, the
amount of information escalated. A
poorly specified search could take days, so again it had to be framed by
specialists. The computer reverted to the control of experts who composed
the questions and filtered the replies.
I eagerly await the next cycle of software development which will put the
information back into the hands of those who want to use it. Whatever
computer gurus may babble about 'neural networks', this has not happened
yet.
An interesting development of this system is the re-use of expertise. The
notes appended
to documents are often more important than the documents. They are the
distilled wisdom of highly paid lawyers. Also, indexing by skilled
professionals adds considerable value to the data. It imposes extra
structure through a layer of analysis and understanding. Once in the system,
the knowledge is available to less-skilled workers.
The real question is how to make money out of the system. In the UK,
lawyers' charges are nominally based on the time taken by particular
members of staff. Decreasing this would imply loss of fees. But many
searches are not billable and cost savings here could be important.
For clients, increased cost may be acceptable if answers arrive more
quickly. The amount of data available for examination may yield a better or
more reliable answer for the same cost. Linklaters might thus recoup its
costs through extra business.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Technology: The quest for Know-How - Claire Gooding
continues a series on getting the most out of software by looking at a UK
firm's in-house computer system which stores a wealth of expertise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING

<TEXT>
There was a time when a solicitor at Linklaters &amp; Paines, the London-based
firm of lawyers, would go walkabout, consulting colleagues in a search for
knowledge. Now, the partners in the corporate department and their
assistants beat a path to one small room.
Surrounded by yellow hanging files and piles of paper waiting to be
processed, a single terminal opens the door to Know-How. This is the
in-house term for a system embracing paper and computerised information
which stores a wealth of expertise.
Information gained from experience is often the most valuable, but it is
also difficult to handle. 'There was a time when the principal sources of
information were a walk along the corridor and the partners' lunch room,'
recalls Barry Dean, director of training and Know-How.
Finding the relevant facts is now easier. Unlike many computerised systems,
Know-How provides a swift route to retrieving facts, rulings and opinions.
The key to this is that the hard work is done by humans. The people refining
the information before its entry into the computer system are as
experienced, and in some cases more so, as those posing the questions.
The custodian of the terminal has become expert at refining the questions
asked so that the computer can search efficiently for the right elements.
Know-How's computerisation is based on software called Kinesis Total Recall,
which uses powerful formulae to retrieve online information, both historical
and contemporary.
'A large part of our work is market-driven. The sort of information our
lawyers need can't be encapsulated in published material. As part of what we
do is to turn things around quickly and to be up to date, we want to capture
the changes as they occur,' says Dean.
Some information is comparatively easy to find and available to anyone using
Linklaters' library. No full-text retrieval system is likely to make books
redundant, nor will the firm ever entirely want to abandon the stroll in
search of an expert.
Know-How has set out to formulate and make accessible a wealth of internal
information. The map references to such information previously existed only
in the heads of experienced solicitors. Now, documents are analysed before
data entry by experts who predict how they are likely to be of use in the
future and encapsulate carefully-coded keywords in the text.
Dean refers to the Know-How systems as an 'experience bank', containing
information on all forms of client work.
'The first cry is, 'Has anyone done this previously?' It's the
identification of the problem that's often the most difficult task,' he
says.
Jeremy Parr, a solicitor in the corporate department who regularly uses the
system, makes it clear the computer is no oracle holding all the answers.
'The role of a lawyer is not just to answer legal questions posed by the
client, but to advise whether a proposal is legally viable. The approach
should always be, 'What is the right question?''
Julie Mackeonis runs the Corporate Mainstream Know-How System, known as
Cormaks. She provides the human link between Cormaks - the first and
best-established of the Know-How systems - and its users, dividing her
duties between answering queries - between 20 and 30 daily - and various
administrative tasks. 'People will come with a broad question. It's a case
of narrowing it down, trying to find the right terminology to retrieve the
right information,' she says.
'Typically, the information on the system is used to shed light on new
situations and interpret them in the light of previous experience,' says
Dean.
It is the experience factor that is important. The money spent on the
computer system pales into insignificance next to the investment in human
expertise. Linklaters has appointed 'information principals' whose job is to
analyse and index the hard-copy material. In the case of Cormaks, the
analyst is Alison James, a qualified lawyer, who now works at home with a
terminal linked to the London-based system, a classic example of
'teleworking'.
The Know-How index contains letters of advice on previous transactions and
situations, opinions of counsel and internal memoranda.
It is vital that the people indexing the data and deciding what should go
into the system should know as much as the people using it.
If James is the architect of the information, Mackeonis, who has no legal
training but some City experience, is very much the curator. Her role is to
know her way around the system and to filter questions so that only sensible
requests are made of the computer. Dave Hall, another information curator
who works in the Cormaks room, has become such an expert on the system that
he is able to do some of the pre-entry analysis himself.
Cormaks is not Linklaters' only Kinesis-based retrieval system. Others serve
the regulatory practice dealing with the Financial Services Act and further
Know-How services are soon to be converted to the Kinesis software.
The human filtering process only takes place for Know-How. Solicitors at
Linklaters are used to having a terminal on their desks for referral to
precedent documents. Corporate mainstream staff also keep close track of
actual stock market transactions.
To get the initial Kinesis systems up and running, Know-How has, for the
time being, been kept entirely separate from the mainstream computing
facilities.
Precedent and practice manuals are frequently updated from the current
Know-How wisdom.
As Parr explains, the system makes available a combination of market
practice, past and present and internal experience. However, Parr and Dean
repeatedly stress that Know-How is only raw material from which to fashion
answers. It cannot take over the 'thinking' part of the job, where the skill
is in interpretation.
What it can do is to ensure the right raw material is readily accessible.
Its other virtue is the ability to provide in-house expertise that is not
available elsewhere.
The system's effectiveness relies in part on people knowing it exists, and
valuing it enough to make voluntary submissions of information. All
Linklaters' trainees receive introductory training. When trainees move on to
another part of the firm where the computerised Know-How system is not yet
operating they miss it badly, a measure of the system's success, says Dean.
The benefits of the system are summed up by Parr. 'It makes the job easier,
gives me a greater sense of security, enables me to respond more quickly and
more helpfully to our clients. In short, it allows us to provide a better,
more competitive service to our clients.'
Dean has reservations about making the system more sophisticated as he
believes neat packaging might discourage hard thinking. 'The documents are
indexed in precise and accurate ways for retrieval. Kinesis has enabled us
to deliver high-quality information in a way that we couldn't before. In the
old days, it was all there in the bulging files, but nobody knew how to get
at it.'

FT  25 FEB 93 / Accountancy Column: Local authorities called to account in
an age of competitive tendering - The new regime for public sector balance
sheets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHARTERED Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy may not bark
often. But its new proposals for capital accounting by local authorities
show that when it barks, it roars. And when it roars, it reveals sharp
teeth.
Public sector treasurers and finance officials can expect a few sleepless
nights ahead as they prepare for compliance with Cipfa's recommendations,
which are likely to be in force for the 1994-95 financial year and which all
will have to obey.
For the first time, local authorities will have to compile registers of
fixed assets such as schools and equipment. Most will have to be shown on
their balance sheets at current cost and regularly revalued. Depreciation
charges will then be charged in their accounts based on these amounts.
Surprising though it may seem, local authorities have never been required to
show fixed assets in their accounts in the past. The emphasis has been on
showing outstanding borrowings on assets which were externally financed.
Assets financed from internal resources or which are paid for have not been
shown.
'Charges at the moment are inconsistent and arbitrary,' says Mr Martin
Evans, head of Cipfa's technical division. 'The balance sheet is
meaningless. At the moment you are comparing chalk and cheese.'
The debate about capital accounting extends as far back as the existence of
local authorities themselves. Municipal corporations at the turn of the
century were debating the inclusion of depreciation of assets in their
accounts rather than focusing simply on loan repayments.
But central government was always most concerned with controlling the amount
of capital expenditure, says Mr Evans. That was reflected in its primary
aim: to control the amount of borrowing. Local authority accounting
developed accordingly, emphasising how assets were financed, not what they
were or how they were used.
He argues that this was the result of a concern to restrict the level of
borrowing and enforce repayment of any funds by local authorities - not a
concern always shared by national government either in the UK or elsewhere
around the world.
That has begun to change, with capital accounting now in place in the
National Health Service and required by Direct Service Organisations running
local authority services as a result of competitive tendering.
For the public sector in general, the most radical changes in accounting
have only really happened in the last 15 years. Few have been as fundamental
as this week's proposals, for which the immediate groundwork was laid nearly
10 years ago after a succession of previous reports which were issued and
largely ignored.
Shortly after the Conservative government's election in 1979, Mr Michael
Heseltine, the environment secretary, told a House of Commons select
committee that the quality of public sector accounting was 'abysmal'.
He began an assault on accounting and auditing which led to the creation of
the Audit Commission, the National Audit Office and the Financial Management
Initiative, designed to improve accountability in central government.
The 1980 local government land and planning act required authorities to
issue annual reports for the first time. But when the first reports came in,
they only made clear to officials how impossible it was to compare the
different figures.
By 1985, the government was threatening to impose detailed new accounting
regulations. In the face of strong opposition, it allowed the Audit
Commission and Cipfa to draft a code of practice, which was endorsed by the
Accounting Standards Committee in 1987.
But Mr Evans says the guidelines essentially represented a codification of
existing best practice rather than any significant change. Most important,
it did not cover capital accounting - a problem identified in a letter to
Cipfa from Mr Nicholas Ridley, the environment secretary at the time.
'We took the letter seriously,' says Mr Evans. 'Perhaps we should not have
done so.' A joint Cipfa and local authority working group studied the issue
yet again, and came up with recommendations in 1990.
Its proposals included showing fixed assets on the balance sheet at current
costs, with regular revaluations at least every five years.
The result, says Mr Evans, was that 'all hell broke loose.' Local
authorities expressed concern over the costs, practicability and timing of
the guidelines. But few could criticise the technicalities of its
recommendations. Their primary concern was the difficulty and costs involved
in changing their accounting systems, and paying for regular revaluations of
fixed assets.
As a result, the threat of change was again prolonged. Cipfa ran a pilot
programme in Solihull metropolitan borough council to study the potential
impact of the new proposals, as well as smaller field tests in Croydon and
Bury St Edmunds. The results were staggering.
Solihull had previously shown fixed assets in its balance sheet of Pounds
117m. Under the proposed system, these rose more than five-fold to Pounds
588m. Yet at the same time, the costs and time involved in implementation
were not that significant - a total of 241 staff days.
That was possible partly because much of the information on assets was
already available although never before collected centrally. The council
also did not attempt to identify every last immaterial asset, and was able
to apply standardised valuation procedures without the need to separately
value each one.
Cipfa will not release the costs incurred by Solihull, but estimates that
the total one-off charges for changing to the new system will be Pounds 6m
for England and Wales, and a further Pounds 1m for local authorities across
Scotland. There would then be about Pounds 1m across the UK each year for
revaluations.
The relatively minor difficulties identified seem to stand in stark contrast
to the costs experienced by implementation at short notice of the same
accounting treatment by the National Health Service, partly incurred by its
efforts to attempt to track down assets even with very low values.
After the consultation period closes in April, it is likely that Cipfa's
guidelines - which have mandatory status - will be on schedule to be
implemented from next year. But many might question the relevance of the
changes.
'We think getting accounts right is important,' says Mr Evans.
'Accountability is at the heart of the public sector. Authorities should be
demonstrating not just stewardship of assets but also how they are used.'
Most important, he stresses that inclusion of assets and a depreciation
charge against them will improve the quality of management.
'If you don't have to pay for assets you are not going to worry about how
you use them,' he says. 'This will highlight the real costs of services. It
brings local authorities as close into line with private sector practice as
we can get.'
The principal differences now between public and private sector will prove
more difficult to change, since they are products of legislation restricting
local authority accounting. These include the treatment of the housing
revenue account.
Whether or not it was part of the reason for the change, the move to capital
accounting will certainly aid comparisons in the move towards compulsory
competitive tendering by local authorities. It may also allow a few more
readers to make sense of the accounts for the first time.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Bid may block holiday companies' sunshine: The tour
operators looking for a bright side in the proposed takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE whose business is selling sun-drenched dreams have little difficulty
putting aside their own regrets and disappointments.
Even the fiercest opponents of Airtours' proposed takeover of rival tour
operator Owners Abroad were yesterday determinedly searching for the bright
side of trade and industry secretary Mr Michael Heseltine's decision not to
refer the deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The Thomas Cook travel agents' chain is potentially the biggest loser from
yesterday's decision. A takeover by Airtours would scupper its own planned
alliance with Owners Abroad. It could also leave it at a disadvantage
against competitors such as Lunn Poly and Pickfords Travel, owned by tour
operators Thomson and Airtours respectively.
Yesterday, however, Mr Christopher Rodrigues, Thomas Cook chief executive,
said that if Airtours does gain control of Owners Abroad, 'we will be the
biggest independent, solely consumer-driven company in the business'. He
added: 'We've had a material number of contacts with people who would wish
to do business with us.'
Mr George Asprou, managing director of independent tour operator Aspro
Holidays, also saw advantages in not being part of either Thomson or an
enlarged Airtours, which would each control about 30 per cent of the market.
He said: 'A merger between Airtours and Owners Abroad would emphasise our
position as one of the largest independent tour operators in the country.
When news of this merger first came through we received calls from travel
agents all over the country who are keen to do business with us.'
Speculation on Mr Heseltine's motives was widespread. Mr Tim Cocking,
president of the National Association of Independent Travel Agents, wondered
whether Mr Heseltine's dismissal of the OFT's recommendation reflected the
low priority the government attached to the travel industry. He said: 'I've
always come away from government departments with the impression they'd
rather be doing something more important.'
Before launching its bid, Airtours cast doubt on small companies' ability to
operate in the travel industry.
In its 1991 annual report, Airtours said: 'The (package) tour market
continues to provide exciting opportunities for innovative operators
although smaller companies will find it increasingly difficult to compete
with their larger and more integrated competitors. Potential new entrants to
the market will be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining bonding,
cost-effective flying and distribution of their product.'
Representatives of the smaller companies did not hide their bitterness - and
incomprehension - over Mr Heseltine's decision.
Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour
Operators, said: 'The OFT is supposed to act as a buffer to protect the best
interests of the public. It cannot be in the public's best interests to
allow the power base of the travel industry to sit in the hands of just two
companies.'
Mr Chris Parker, chairman of medium-sized tour operator Unijet, said
barriers to entry had been raised substantially over the past five years.
The Civil Aviation Authority, which grants licences to companies taking
holidaymakers abroad by air, had become more vigilant in its monitoring of
travel groups' financial health.
Another constraint was the increasing cost of technology. Travel agents have
sophisticated computerised booking systems and tour operators need to buy
compatible technology.
Mr Parker said: 'If you want to make sure that the multiple travel agents
sell your product you've got to have a fairly sophisticated computer
system.'
Whatever consternation Mr Heseltine's decision caused in the industry, Mr
Bruce Shepherd, sales director of AT Mays, a travel agents' chain with 289
shops, doubted a takeover of Owners Abroad would change much.
'There's still plenty of choice of holidays on the market and there always
will be. I don't think the customers will see any difference,' he said.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Alarm over Heseltine's move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, not to
refer the proposed acquisition by Airtours of the Owners Abroad Group to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission has alarmed and surprised specialists in
competition law.
It is the second time in two weeks that Mr Heseltine has overridden a
recommendation from Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair
trading, to refer a merger to the commission.
Earlier this month he rejected advice to refer a merger of the infra-red
defence components businesses of GEC and Philips Electronics.
Until this year the director-general's advice to refer a merger to the
commission had been overridden on only 11 occasions since the arrangements
for such referrals were put in place in 1973. Mr Heseltine appears more
willing than many of his predecessors to second-guess the director-general,
who is the competition regulator.
More puzzling to observers, however, are the grounds on which Mr Heseltine
is believed to have made his decision. It appears he felt that the case for
referral on competition grounds was 'finely balanced', based on these
factors: The large number of competitors in the package tour business.
The ease of entry for companies wishing to enter the market.
The rapidity with which a company's market share can change in the industry.
In taking these reasons into account Mr Heseltine has challenged Sir Bryan's
judgment that the merger would reduce competition in the package tours
market. Sir Bryan will have reached his recommendation only after taking
evidence from interested parties and detailed analysis of the package tour
market.
Mr Stephen Locke, director of the Policy Unit at the Consumers' Association,
described the decision as 'baffling'.
He said: 'The substantive issues may have been finely balanced, but the case
for referring the merger to the MMC to review them was not.'
Mr Heseltine gave similar reasons earlier in the month when he rejected
referral of the merger of the GEC and Philips Electronics businesses. He
felt the competition issues were not sufficient to justify a reference.
For Mr Thomas Sharpe, a barrister specialising in competition law, this
shows a worrying tendency to overrule the advice of the competition
watchdog. Mr Sharpe accepts it might be appropriate for the trade secretary
to refer a case to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission even when the
director-general has not recommended referral.
This has happened on six occasions in the past. In three of these Mr Peter
Lilley, when trade and industry secretary, referred take-overs of private
companies in the UK by state-owned foreign companies because he was
concerned that they had an unfair advantage from their status as
nationalised industries.
Mr Sharpe said: 'Section 84 of the 1973 Fair Trading Act makes it clear that
referral can be on several public interest grounds of which competition is
just one.
'But when the competition watchdog says that a merger raises competition
issues and recommends referral to the MMC, the Department of Trade and
Industry should not second-guess them and say that they know better.'
There are also fears that a more interventionist approach by the DTI will
encourage companies to lobby politicians over mergers.
One advantage of leaving it to an independent Office of Fair Trading is that
campaigns on behalf of particular mergers on the grounds they are in the
national interest or will save jobs are less likely to succeed.
Mr Locke of the Consumers' Association, however, said the decision threw
into question the government's commitment to tighten competition policy.
He said: 'What is the point of issuing a green paper on new legislation to
strengthen competition policy when the government appears to hold the
subject in such low regard?'

FT  25 FEB 93 / Ford unions warn of strike action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the US carmaker, faces the prospect of an all-out strike this spring
at all 21 UK plants over compulsory redundancies.
Unions representing 9,000 white-collar staff at Ford announced yesterday
that they would ballot members early next month on whether to launch
industrial action against any planned job cuts.
Unions representing Ford's 24,400 manual workers are due to meet the company
on March 11. They say that they also intend to hold a strike ballot if they
do not receive a guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies
among production workers.
The unions - the TGWU general union and the MSF white-collar union - said
yesterday that Ford had rejected all their proposals to avoid the proposed
job losses and had refused to consult them.
It is the first time in 30 years that Ford has sought compulsory
redundancies at its UK plants. In December the company announced it needed
to cut its white-collar labour force by 1,200. Ford said so far 650 workers
had volunteered for redundancy from staff grades.
It also said that the manual workforce had to be reduced by 1,180 at its
plants at Dagenham, east London, Halewood on Merseyside and Bridgend, south
Wales. So far 530 workers have agreed to go.
Ford set a deadline of March 30 for voluntary redundancies but recently it
has warned hundreds of workers that they could be made compulsorily
redundant. The company said that it had to reduce its workforce because of
falling demand for its models and as part of an efficiency drive in its
European operations.
Both the MSF and the TGWU said yesterday that this week's announcement by
Ford of 500 new research and development jobs at its plant at Dunton, Essex
did not affect the outlook. They pointed out the jobs were not new but part
of a relocation deal with Germany in which the UK would lose more jobs to
Germany than were gained.
Mr Bob Purkiss, TGWU national officer, said he was urging his members to
resist what he called the threat of 'unprecedented sackings'. Mr Jim Thomas,
MSF official for the motor industry, added the unions had 'no choice but to
urge our members to take a stand against this shabby treatment'.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Hacker caused computer to 'crash', jury is told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPUTER system used by an international cancer research centre was put
out of action by a schoolboy computer hacker, Southwark Crown Court was told
yesterday, John Mason writes.
Mr Paul Bedworth, now 19, installed a rogue program into the computer used
by the Brussels-based European Organisation for the Research and Treatment
of Cancer, the jury heard. This caused the system to 'crash', Mr Vincent
Piedboeuf, the centre's head of information technology said. It was the
worst systems breakdown the centre had experienced, he said. Surgeons needed
24 hour a day access to the computer files, which held details of patients
and treatments they were receiving.
Mr Bedworth, of Ilkley, West Yorkshire, denies charges including obtaining
unauthorised access to computer material and unauthorised modification of
computers under the Computer Misuse Act.
The trial continues today.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Estate that is no longer safe as
houses - The housing bill and the Duke of Westminster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO LANDLORD will be more affected by the Housing and Urban Development Bill
than the Duke of Westminster, who owns 100 acres of Mayfair and 200 acres of
Belgravia.
The new law, likely to receive Royal Assent in the summer, will give
leaseholders the right to buy the freeholds on their houses, and will force
the Duke of Westminster to sell property that has been in his family for
more than 300 years.
He views his London estates as the 'jewel in the crown' of his holdings,
which include 10,000 acres of agricultural land in Chester, shopping centres
round the UK and commercial property throughout North America and Australia.
His agricultural estates date back to Norman times, while the London estate
dates back to 1677, when 500 acres of poor farm land was given to the Duke's
forebear, Sir Thomas Grosvenor, on his marriage.
It was gradually developed as Mayfair, Belgravia and Pimlico - the Pimlico
estate was sold in 1953. The Duke has described his land holdings as his
family heritage. 'History undoubtedly classifies the Grosvenor family as
landowners,' he says.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, has described the bill, which has
just passed its second reading in the House of Lords, as 'an essential part
of our policy on extending home ownership.' It has been enthusiastically
welcomed by leaseholders who believe it will tackle problems associated with
bad management of blocks of flats and the difficulties of selling shorter
leases, which cannot attract mortgage finance.
The legislation is particularly welcomed by leaseholders of more valuable
houses with a rateable value more than Pounds 1500 in London. They were
excluded from the Leasehold Reform Act of 1967 (which gave most householders
the right to enfranchise) after heavy lobbying from large landowners, but
will be embraced by the new legislation.
But the legislation is bitterly resented by large landowners, who see it as
an arbitrary transfer of property from one section of the community to
another.
The Duke of Westminster considers that he will not be adequately compensated
for the forced sale of his property, since he will split the 'marriage
value' (the gain in a property's value from putting the leasehold and
freehold together) with the leaseholder. He estimates that some leaseholders
will gain up to Pounds 250,000 by enfranchising.
The Duke says there is principle as well as money at stake. The Grosvenor
Estate says that the proposals are 'a massive infringement of two
long-standing democratic principles' - the right of a private citizen to own
and enjoy private property and the right to uphold contracts freely entered
into.'
The Grosvenor Estate also claims that the new legislation will damage the
appearance of one of the most prestigious parts of London, which owes its
appearance to its scrupulous estate management. 'We are concerned about the
loss of uniform management, the control and enhancement of the urban
environment and the broader benefits to a community an estate like ours
should bring,' he said last month.
The Duke of Westminster's dramatic resignation from the Conservative party
is not the first high-profile protest he has made against the principle of
leasehold enfranchisement.
The first stemmed from the 1967 Leasehold Enfranchisement Act, which
resulted in the sale of 80 houses at a loss of Pounds 2.5m to the Grosvenor
Estate. The forced sale (or 'confiscation' as he put it) of these properties
drove the Duke to take a case against the government to the European Court
of Human Rights.
However, in 1986 the Court found against the Grosvenor Estate. 'The
compulsory transfer of property from one individual to another might
constitute a legitimate means for promoting the public interest,' it said.
This left the Duke unconvinced. Speaking last month about leasehold
enfranchisement, he said: 'The implications of this legislation are
fundamental in a country which has no written constitution and relies on
Parliamentary precedent - because this law interferes with basic liberties
it should send shivers down all our spines.'

FT  25 FEB 93 / Imro chief urges new pensions regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PENSIONS industry needs a new regulator to force trustees to demonstrate
they are competent and independent of the employer, and order their removal
if necessary, Mr John Morgan, chief executive of Imro, the fund managers'
self-regulatory body, said yesterday.
He told the annual investment conference of the National Association of
Pension Funds in Eastbourne that the current patchwork system of pension
regulation had become 'a dog's breakfast'.
Mr Morgan said: 'The rules of the game are not clear, particularly to
trustees who are the most important players, and present opportunities for a
variety of interpretations, possibly to the detriment of scheme members.'
He acknowledged that the cost of tougher regulation could force some smaller
schemes out of business.
Rather than replace trust law which governs pension funds, the industry
should be more effectively regulated and its rules enforced.
The new regulator's remit should cover all aspects of the business except
fund management, currently supervised by Imro which was responsible for
authorising the late Mr Robert Maxwell's company, Bishopsgate Investment
Management, which managed employee pension funds later found to be missing
more than Pounds 440m.
Mr Morgan, who acknowledged Imro's part in the Maxwell affair, retires in
July, two months early, and will be succeeded by Mr Philip Thorpe, a special
adviser to the Securities and Investments Board.
Mr Morgan said the current system placed far too much responsibility on
individual trustees who might or might not be up to the task.
A pensions regulator should have the scope to review the eligibility and
appointment of trustees and the relationship between the employer and
trustees, and to enforce regular reporting by trustees and scheme
administrators to beneficiaries and regulators. The Commons' social security
committee plans to examine the handling of the pension funds of a number of
formerly state-owned companies, as part of an inquiry into the government's
plans for the pension funds of soon-to-be-privatised businesses.
Harland &amp; Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder, Swan Hunter, its Tyneside
counterpart, and National Bus Company are among the former public-sector
entities whose funds the cross-party body plans to look at.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lawson criticises the government
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD LAWSON, the former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday
criticised the government for failing to consult the German central bank
before taking sterling into the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Lord Lawson told the Commons foreign affairs committee that failure to agree
a level for sterling with the Bundesbank ahead of entry contributed to
Britain's forced withdrawal last year from the semi-fixed currency grid.
'In 1990 there was no agreement of the rate at all,' he said. 'The Germans
had to take it or leave it. That was not a sensible basis.'
He called last September's ERM withdrawal a 'humiliation and a defeat for
Britain,' saying it had led to a collapse in confidence within the British
economy.

FT  25 FEB 93 / BBC 'could sell channel' to cut licence fee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the BBC's two national television channels could be sold to reduce
the burden of the licence fee, a London conference was told yesterday.
Mr Adam Singer, vice-president (international) for Tele-Communications, the
largest US cable operator, said the released channel could be used to start
a UK version of Canal Plus, the French sports and subscription film channel
which is broadcast over conventional transmitters.
Mr Singer, whose father Mr Aubrey Singer is a former managing director of
BBC Television, said such an auction was just one example of radical options
for the future of the corporation.
Speaking at the FT Cable and Satellite Broadcasting Conference, he said:
'There has been a singular absence of radical thinking and questioning of
not just the BBC's function and purpose, but the justifiable scope of its
activities.'
Mr Singer said the technical forces facing the BBC, particularly new
channels, would make it redundant in its present form.
His Denver-based company TCI plans to introduce more than 400 channels of
television in its cable systems over the next three years, using digital
technology.
In the UK 6.5m homes are expected to have access to multi-channel television
by the year 2000 - about a third of the total.
Mr Jon Davey, director of cable and satellite at the Independent Television
Commission, yesterday released the latest cable television statistics,
covering up to the start of this year.
They show that modern cable systems have 440,162 subscribers, an increase of
65 per cent during the year.
From July to December there was an average net increase of 18,000 cable
subscribers every month.
Mr Davey said he believed there were a number of big new cable deals in the
pipeline.
Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames Television, said he would be
making an announcement soon about bringing a new satellite channel to the UK
using the Astra satellite.
It would be one of a growing number of satellite channels. None of them on
their own would threaten the dominance of ITV.
'But there comes a point at which all of them, taken together, achieve a
critical mass of penetration, of viewers' time, and of advertising revenue,
so that their economic base is large enough for them to have real buying
power,' Mr Dunn said.
He predicted that critical mass would be reached this year or next.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Union of Democratic Mineworkers yesterday asked all non-Labour MPs to
oppose the government's forthcoming white paper on the future of the mining
industry if it endorses any pit closures.
In a letter to MPs, Mr Neil Greatrex, the UDM president, asked them to
support 'in its entirety' the Commons trade and industry committee report to
keep all 31 pits open.
The union intends to organise private meetings with up to 55 MPs, most of
them Conservatives, over the next few days to urge them to reject any
government measures that would mean closing any of the 31 threatened pits.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Concession over medicines bill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A BILL to increase information on the safety of medicines yesterday cleared
another parliamentary hurdle after its sponsor - Mr Giles Radice, the Labour
MP for Durham North - agreed to changes designed to address pharmaceutical
industry concerns.
The Medicines Information Bill will now move to its Commons report stage in
April. But the government's ambivalent attitude still means that it is far
from certain to become law.
Speaking after yesterday's proceedings, Mr Peter Lumley, director of public
affairs at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said:
'The bill as it now stands is not anywhere near as formidable a problem for
the industry as it was when first printed.'
Yesterday's breakthrough came when Mr Radice agreed to withdraw clauses that
would have given consumers the right of access to information held by drug
licencing authorities on the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines,
subject to certain restrictions.

ARMY OFFICERS serving in Bosnia could be among the more than 600 to be
handed compulsory redundancy notices today, Mr Archie Hamilton, armed forces
minister, admitted in the Commons last night, David Owen writes.
Under questioning from Mr John Reid, the Labour defence spokesman, Mr
Hamilton told MPs: 'There is a possibility that a small number of serving
officers in Bosnia may be made compulsorily redundant.'
It was also possible that serving officers in Northern Ireland could receive
similar notices.
Mr Hamilton had earlier come under pressure from Tory backbenchers after he
rejected the recent call by the cross-party defence committee for all
infantry battalion amalgamations and disbandments to be cancelled.
To do this, he said, would cost Pounds 200m a year, as well as distorting
the balance between the infantry and other army branches.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shephard hints at 'workfare'
options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS GILLIAN SHEPHARD, the employment secretary, yesterday indicated that she
was actively considering extending compulsory obligations on the long-term
unemployed.
Mrs Shephard was giving evidence - for the third time - to the Commons
Select Committee on Employment.
The employment secretary was questioned closely by the committee on whether
the government intended to introduce 'workfare'.
Mrs Shephard said it depended on what was meant by the term workfare. She
said she rejected the idea of a monolithic scheme to be extended to all the
three million unemployed. 'We are looking at a range of options that will
build on what is already in the system,' she said, adding that some of the
changes could be profound.
It is understood that should the government introduce new compulsory
measures for either work experience or training they would be targeted at 18
to 24-year-olds.
A plan to continue to pay benefit for a year to anyone out of work for five
years after they found a job paying more than Pounds 50 a week was proposed
yesterday by Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the social security
committee.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Emu rethink call by Bank official
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Bank of England official yesterday suggested that European
Community governments should look again at the rules they had agreed for
determining when EC member states would become members of the planned
European economic and monetary union.
Mr Andrew Crockett, the Bank's executive director for international affairs,
told the Commons' Treasury and Civil Service committee that the 'convergence
criteria' setting the conditions for entry into the final third stage of Emu
under the Maastricht treaty did not address several important issues that
would confront countries approaching union.
The criteria stipulate that EC member states should have brought their
inflation rates, interest rates and budget deficits broadly into line before
moving ahead to a European single currency and central bank. But Mr Crockett
said countries should also ask themselves whether their economies were
flexible enough for such a step and whether they could absorb economic
shocks such as German unity.
He said he would have welcomed the inclusion of other economic criteria such
as unemployment in the Maastricht package and would like to see countries
consider the question when they review the Maastricht Treaty and plans for
economic and political union in 1996.
Mr Crockett stressed, however, that he was not seeking a relaxation of the
strict anti-inflationary tone of the plans for Emu. There was general
agreement that price stability was important as the basis for sustainable
growth. Expressing his own view, Mr Crockett said he believed that there
were significant advantages in giving 'more autonomy' to central banks to
achieve that goal.
Answering questions from Mr Quentin Davies, Tory MP for Stamford and
Spalding, Mr Crockett agreed that the Maastricht treaty contained the germ
of a serious constitutional conflict in Europe over exchange rate policy.

WESTMINSTER skirmishing over the Maastricht treaty took a further twist last
night as Liberal Democrat MPs indicated that they were likely to join with
the Labour party in a fresh attempt at forcing the insertion of the social
chapter into the treaty.
The latest procedural device discovered by the opposition parties centres on
an amendment tabled by Mr Calum Macdonald, Labour MP for Western Isles.
Heightening the possibility of the government being defeated over the issue,
Conservative Euro-sceptic MPs also indicated that they may back Mr
Macdonald's amendment - if it is selected for debate - in the hope that will
it prevent the government ratifying the treaty.
'It's a real wrecker this one, it appears,' said one Euro-sceptic.
However, Labour and the Liberal Democrats argue that if the amendment is
passed the government could still ratify the treaty by bowing to the will of
parliament and inserting the social chapter.
Today Mr George Robertson, the party's European spokesman, will press Mr
Michael Morris, the deputy speaker who presides over the bill's committee
stage, for a full debate on the social chapter itself when MPs resume the
Maastricht bill's committee stage.
Mr Charles Kennedy, president of the Liberal Democrats, said the government
was making a 'complete mess' of the debate over the social chapter. 'We hold
to our determination to see the Maastricht treaty ratified and the social
chapter included,' he said.
Labour has said it will not back wrecking amendments - but has also made
re-inserting the social chapter as its top priority. It won a small victory
on Monday by securing a debate on the government's legal advice
Meanwhile, Tory Euro-sceptics have been encouraged by the succession of
legal and procedural disputes that have engulfed the government.
Mr Macdonald's amendment, which is unlikely to be voted on for several
weeks, would remove Maastricht's social protocol - which includes Britain's
'opt-out' - from the part of the Maastricht bill that increases the powers
of the European parliament.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lawson criticises moves on ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD LAWSON, the former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday
criticised the government for failing to consult the German central bank
before taking sterling into the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Giving evidence to the Commons' foreign affairs committee, Lord Lawson said
that failure to agree a level for sterling with the Bundesbank ahead of
entry contributed to Britain's forced withdrawal last year from the
semi-fixed currency grid.
'In 1990 there was no agreement of the rate at all,' he said. 'The Germans
had to take it or leave it. That was not a sensible basis.'
Lord Lawson, who was chancellor for six years under Mrs Margaret Thatcher,
said he had reached a tacit agreement with the Bundesbank when he was
preparing sterling's entry in 1985. Thatcher vetoed the move.
When Britain finally joined the ERM in October 1990 under his successor as
chancellor Mr John Major, the Bundesbank thought the level was too high and
was not prepared to support sterling when it came under intense pressure
from speculators, he added.
Lord Lawson, who resigned as chancellor in October 1989 in part over
disagreements with Mrs Thatcher on sterling's ERM entry and other economic
issues, called last September's ERM withdrawal a 'humiliation and a defeat
for Britain'. He said it led to a collapse in confidence within the British
economy, adding that he would agree with pundits who dubbed the day 'Black
Wednesday'.

venture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COX CABLE Communications of Atlanta and Southwestern Bell are considering a
joint venture to buy and operate cable systems in the UK.
The talks follow Southwestern Bell's decision last week to buy a US cable TV
network for Dollars 650m (Pounds 458m).
The deal will represent Cox's second move into the UK. The media group is a
significant investor in UK Gold, the satellite channel specialising in
re-runs of classic programmes.
The UK cable market is attracting attention from US companies as much for
the opportunity to offer telecommunications services as for the chance to
operate television channels.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mackay to press ahead with legal
aid cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD MACKAY, the Lord Chancellor, confirmed last night that he is to press
ahead 'as soon as possible' with proposals outlined in the Autumn Statement
to cut legal aid eligibility. He told the Home Affairs Committee he had been
prepared to consider alternative proposals to achieve the Pounds 43m saving
needed in the Legal Aid Budget but that time had now run out.
The Law Society and the Bar had put forward five proposals including a pay
freeze for legal aid lawyers in 1993/94, which they claimed would save the
Pounds 43m needed. But the Lord Chancellor said a more realistic assessment
of the saving through the proposals was Pounds 8m. Legal aid expenditure is
expected to reach Pounds 1.1bn this year. He rejected suggestions that a
sharp drop in the number of criminal cases in which legal aid was granted in
the last quarter of 1992 would provide almost all the savings.
The Law Society told the MPs earlier in the day that the 13 per cent drop in
legal aid certificates granted in criminal cases in the last quarter of 1992
would produce a saving of Pounds 37m if the trend continued over the whole
year.
But Lord Mackay said it was unsafe to plan on the assumption that such a
trend would continue. It was notoriously difficult to predict the final
outturn for legal aid expenditure even towards the end of a year.
He also rejected as 'absurd' the Law Society's contention that 14m people
would be affected by the eligibility cuts either because they would no
longer qualify for free legal aid or because they could not afford to pay an
increased contribution towards the cost of their case.
This year just over 3m people would receive financial assistance from the
legal aid scheme. Lord Mackay estimated that in practical terms 120,000
people a year would be affected by his proposals.

THE COMMONS social security committee plans to examine the handling of the
pension funds of a number of formerly state-owned companies, as part of an
inquiry into the government's plans for the pension funds of
soon-to-be-privatised businesses.
Harland &amp; Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder, Swan Hunter, its Tyneside

FT  25 FEB 93 / Doubts over Art Deco icon: Campaigners concerned over the
future of the listed power station will have to wait a while longer to be
sure it is safe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BATTERSEA Power Station, for the past four years an embarrassing symbol of
the conflict between the desire to preserve the past and the commercial
realities of the London property market, is going to a new owner.
Campaigners concerned for its preservation will have to wait a bit longer,
however, before they can be sure that its future is safe in Hong Kong hands.
The property-owning Hwang family which is acquiring the site is giving no
guarantees and has made it clear it will be considering all options. This
could include seeking listed building consent to demolish or alter the
now-derelict building.
They might also decide to go ahead with a mixed-usage development.
The Hwangs are consummate businessmen with an eye - like every other
property developer - on the inherent value of one of the biggest development
sites in inner London.
For those who prefer a chunk of flat land, this site is spoiled slightly by
Gilbert Scott's huge Art Deco power station which, with its four chimneys,
looks like an upturned table and dominates the Battersea skyline.
Mr George Hwang and Mr Victor Hwang, the brothers negotiating the deal on
behalf of their family, are known in Hong Kong for their interests in the
prestigious Parkview complex in the colony's Tai Tam country park.
The complex is partly owned by Chyau Fwu, their private company, but it
recently sold part of the development to their listed vehicle, which changed
its name from Ming Ren Holdings to the Hong Kong Parkview Group in January.
The family, headed by their Taiwanese-born father Mr Hwang Chou-shiuan,
bought a controlling stake in Parkview in 1990.
Later the same year the company made its first foray into the UK by
acquiring a majority stake in FBM Marine, formerly Fairey Marine, the Isle
of Wight boatbuilder which has a number of military and domestic contracts,
including a project to develop a high-speed catamaran for the Ministry of
Defence.
It also supplied the catamarans which are used by the London riverbus
service.
Other Parkview interests in Hong Kong include a 20-year exclusive franchise
from the Chinese government to run a ferry service between Hong Kong and
Shenzhen airport. In the year to March 1992 the company made a profit of
HKDollars 6.3m (Pounds 560,000). In the six months to September 1992,
however, it recorded a HKDollars 590,000 loss.
The Chyau Fwu company emerged from Taiwan where it carried out extensive
infrastructure projects such as the construction of airports, dams, railways
and schools.
Among the biggest Taiwan development projects were the construction of World
Wide House and Bank Tower Taipei.
Mr Hwang senior left Taiwan after four officials from Chyau Fwu were charged
with bribery offences in March 1989, but the family's supporters in Hong
Kong have pointed out that such cases are not uncommon in Taiwan.
Three years ago the Hwangs surprised the Hong Kong stock market when they
launched an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid for Evergo International and
Chinese Estates.
Recently the family has been injecting more of its assets into Parkview. The
company's current ventures include a 20 per cent stake in a USDollars 500m
(Pounds 342m) Japanese theme park. It has also been studying the possibility
of relocating an oil refinery from the United States to China.
The oil venture is part of a complex scheme, under review by the Hwangs,
that they believe would give the company a big stake in Chinese oil
production.
The family members are keeping their thoughts to themselves as to the future
of the power station.
Financial details of their move to buy the power station site have not been
revealed but it is thought that the syndicate of banks that backed Mr John
Broome's leisure development will have had to sell their debt, signing away
their right to the site at the same time, at a considerable discount.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Battersea deal raises questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Simon Haywood, director of finance at Wandsworth Council, said last night
the council was in the dark about the nature of negotiations over the sale
of Battersea Power Station involving a Hong Kong property family.
He said: 'We hope to have meetings in the next few days with the parties
concerned to establish who exactly we are dealing with.'
The Hong Kong brothers negotiating to acquire Battersea Power Station and
its 31-acre site in south London said yesterday that they would start by
buying the bank debt on the development.
The debt deal, expected to be concluded within the next few days, will be
the first stage in gaining overall control of the site, which is owned by
Battersea Leisure, a company controlled by Mr John Broome, the property
developer and theme-park owner.
Mr George and Mr Victor Hwang - the brothers who also go under the name
Wong, the western equivalent of their name - will in effect become Mr
Broome's lenders on the site which they will then be able to claim as
collateral for loans which are in default.
The size of the debt has not been disclosed but with interest it is likely
by now to be more than Pounds 100m.
The banking syndicate led by Bank of America is likely to be selling the
debt at a considerable discount.
How or when the transfer of the site to the Hwangs will happen is not yet
clear. It is understood that Mr Broome's role in the development is unlikely
to continue for long although a decision on his role has not yet been made.
Mr Broome has just over a week to appeal against a court decision taxing him
for an estimated Pounds 20,000 in legal costs involved in the council's
legal pursuit of Pounds 170,000 owed on overdue building fees.
The sum of Pounds 170,000 was agreed to in an out-of-court settlement by all
the parties concerned last summer but remains unpaid.
Mr Guy Senior, chairman of the council's planning committee, said that over
the past month the issue has been the subject of renewed correspondence and
meetings between Mr Broome and the council.
Mr Senior said: 'We have made it clear that if we do not receive the money
we are owed we shall seek to have a statutory order served on the company
and have it declared insolvent.'

FT  25 FEB 93 / Hong Kong brothers may buy debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong brothers negotiating to acquire Battersea Power station and
its 31-acre site in south London confirmed yesterday that they would start
by buying the bank debt on the development.
The deal to buy out the debt, which is expected to be concluded within the
next few days, will be the first stage in gaining overall control of the
site which is owned by Battersea Leisure, a company controlled by Mr John
Broome, the property developer and theme-park owner.
Mr George and Mr Victor Hwang - the brothers who also go under the name
Wong, the western equivalent of their name - will in effect become Mr
Broome's lenders on the site which they will then be able to claim as
collateral for loans which are in default.
The size of the debt has not been disclosed but with interest it is likely
by now to be more than Pounds 100m.
The banking syndicate led by Bank of America is likely to be selling the
debt at a considerable discount.
Just how or when the transfer of the site to the Hwangs will happen is not
yet clear but it is understood that Mr Broome's role in the development is
unlikely to continue for a great length of time although a decision on his
role has not yet been made.
It emerged yesterday that Mr Broome had been facing increasing pressure over
the past month from the local authority, Wandsworth, over more than Pounds
200,000 of outstanding building and legal fees owed by Battersea Leisure.
Mr Broome has just over a week to appeal against a court decision taxing him
for an estimated Pounds 20,000 in legal costs involved in the council's
legal pursuit of Pounds 170,000 owed on overdue building fees.
The sum of Pounds 170,000 was agreed to in an out-of-court settlement by all
the parties concerned last summer but remains unpaid.
Mr Guy Senior, chairman of the council's planning committee, said yesterday
that over the last month the issue has been the subject of renewed
correspondence and meetings between Mr Broome and the council.
Mr Senior said: 'We have made it clear that if we do not receive the money
we are owed we shall seek to have a statutory order served on the company
and have it declared insolvent.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERCENTAGE of redundant executives receiving job offers is rising,
particularly in the south-east, Drake Beam Morrin, outplacement consultants,
says.
A total of 16 per cent of executives it counselled received offers in the
first four weeks of the year - up from 10 per cent last year. In the
south-east the proportion rose from 9 per cent to 18 per cent and in the
Midlands from 10 per cent to 17.6 per cent.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Construction orders fall 10%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL orders received by contractors for construction work fell 10 per cent
in the final quarter of last year, compared with the same period in 1991,
Department of the Environment figures show.
Private commercial work, mostly offices and shops, and private housing were
worst affected, with orders 28 per cent and 18 per cent lower respectively.
A House-Builders Federation survey, however, has found a revival in sales
this year with a sharp rise in the number of buyers visiting show homes.
Three quarters of builders expect to build more homes this year.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Call for Pounds 7bn Tube investment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOTAL of Pounds 7bn needs to be spent on London's Tube system over the
next 10 years if the capital is to have a 'decently modern metro' by the end
of that period, London Underground said yesterday.
It warned that if the government failed to provide funding, London could be
stuck with an 'sprawling, overcrowded and neglected' metro for 20 years.
Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, London Underground's managing director, said action
was urgently needed to compensate for a backlog of investment.

RENAULT, the French vehicle maker, confirmed yesterday that it would use
Leyland Daf, the collapsed commercial vehicle maker, as a sub-contractor in
developing a new heavy van range.
Renault and Daf started on the joint development of a new 2.5 tonnes to 4.2
tonnes van range, code-named Excel, in 1990. Renault has now acquired all
the industrial property rights for the range.
The development of the van will continue in Birmingham with the existing
team of 50 Renault engineering staff and will use 190 Leyland Daf
engineering staff on a sub-contract.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT Brothers, the Belfast aircraft and missiles manufacturer, yesterday
announced that job losses were inevitable following production cuts.
It blamed the decision on reduced orders from Fokker, the Dutch aircraft
company which uses Shorts to produce wings for its Fokker 100 aircraft.
Fokker said the recession in the aerospace industry had caused its cut.
Shorts, a subsidiary of Bombardier, the Canadian transportation group,
employs 1,000 people in the Fokker wing production division.

THE Irish government has asked the European Commission to investigate claims
that Britain breached EC competition rules by offering incentives to keep
open a computer manufacturing plant at Ayr in south-west Scotland.
Dublin says the incentives - in the form of public procurements and state
aids - have been offered to Digital Equipment, the US computer manufacturer,
which is to decide this week whether to concentrate production at the Ayr
plant, or at a similar one at Galway in the west of Ireland. The Ayr plant
employs 980, the Galway one 1,100.
On Tuesday Mr Padraic MacKernan, Ireland's ambassador to the EC, delivered
letters to both Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, and Mr
Renie Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC commissioner for the internal market, asking
them to investigate whether the incentives offered by the UK government to
Digital had breached EC competition rules.
Ireland's department of enterprise and employment said yesterday the request
did not yet constitute a formal complaint to the EC, as hard evidence was
lacking. The request was being made on the basis of media reports out of
Scotland 'and information which has emanated from non-media sources in
Britain and Scotland'.
The Scottish Office refused yesterday to comment beyond saying it was a
matter between the Irish government and the commission.
Any question of support for Digital's European reorganisation would be
subject to the normal EC rules on state aid, it added.
Scottish Enterprise, the development body, said it had 'no difficulty with
any investigation'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASSIDY DAVIS, the Lloyd's managing agency, has formed an underwriting
'consortium' with two of France's largest insurance companies, allowing it
to underwrite an extra Pounds 12m of business.
The agreement, the first by any Lloyd's syndicate since rules governing such
arrangements were eased last year, allows the underwriter of Cassidy Davis
syndicate 582 to accept the extra business on behalf of Assurance Generales
de France and SCOR.
Two brokers, Hayward Till and Jardine Thompson Graham, are also involved in
the deal, which is geared to increasing sales of creditor insurance -
accident, sickness and unemployment cover for loans.
Consortia between syndicates and insurance companies are one of the main
ways that extra capital can be brought to the Lloyd's market, where
insurance capacity has shrunk following recent heavy losses.
Capital is expected to fall to less than Pounds 8.5bn in 1993, compared with
Pounds 10.1bn in 1992, owing to the fall in the number of Names -
individuals whose capital supports Lloyd's.
'It gives us the capacity we need in an expanding market,' said Mr Tony
Cassidy, chairman of Cassidy Davis.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERSEYSIDE and the Scottish Highlands and Islands yesterday welcomed their
inclusion in the proposed list of European Community regions qualifying for
extra grants under the Objective 1 criteria.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, also welcomed the
announcement and said he would continue to press for the inclusion of Devon
and Cornwall, rural Wales and South Yorkshire.
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the development body for the region, said
it could gain more than Pounds 20m a year if it secured Objective 1 status.
This could open the way to projects such as a university for the Highlands
and Islands, a ferry or causeway linking the islands of the Western Isles
and improved roads.
Mr Harry Rimmer, leader of Liverpool City Council, stressed yesterday's
decision was only a first step, as the recommendation has to be approved by
the Council of Ministers in June.
Merseyside is relieved its case has been accepted in Brussels. Its gross
domestic product a head averaged 79 per cent for 1988-90, but has fallen at
a rate of 2 percentage points a year and was at 77 per cent at the start of
1991.
Objective 1 funds will be increased by 56 per cent over present levels in
the next seven years, while areas with Objective 2 status - as Merseyside is
now - will get only 8 per cent extra.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR BRUCE Millan, EC regional policy commissioner, yesterday confirmed the UK
risked losing 'large' sums of Community aid for depressed regions unless it
conformed to rules obliging member states to match Community funds.
The commissioner has written to the British government seeking urgent talks
following complaints from local authorities in the nine UK regions eligible
for regional aid grants.
Senior commission officials confirmed that up to Pounds 1bn earmarked for
the UK has still to be disbursed - and could be lost if not committed to
regional development schemes by the end of this year. 'If they don't want to
lose the money they will have to do something about it,' Mr Millan said,
although he added: 'Nobody is suggesting that they're going to lose
everything.'
The Department of Trade and Industry sought to play down the row saying
funds would be matched - although final details have still to be agreed.
The government came under attack, however, from Mr Derek Fatchett, Labour
industry spokesman. In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, he said: 'It would be beyond the comprehension of the British
public if, at a time of mounting unemployment, the actions of the British
government deprived some of our most disadvantaged regions of EC regional
aid.'
The UK was assigned Ecu2.6bn (Pounds 2.14bn) in 1989-93 for the for the nine
'industrially declining' regions, ranging from Merseyside to Tyneside. At
the end of last year Ecu1.91bn had been committed to development programmes
in these regions, leaving Ecu691m for 1993. But by the end of last year only
Ecu1.37bn had been distributed by Brussels, partly, a commission official
confirmed, because of the 'matching funds' dispute. A total of Ecu1.23bn is
still outstanding.
Under EC rules community help for depressed regions must be matched by
funding to local authorities provided by governments. Under UK practice all
EC money is channelled through the Treasury. Brussels insists this means
ineligible regions get some of it, and those which are eligible do not get
their entitlement.
The EC funds 'cannot just go into a Treasury pot,' Mr Millan said yesterday.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Devonport plan to save jobs at Rosyth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INGENIOUS proposal to save 1,000 jobs at the Rosyth dockyard in Scotland
by developing an oil tanker refitting facility has been put forward by
Devonport, its arch-rival for naval contracts.
The two yards are competing fiercely for the contract to refit the navy's
Trident nuclear submarines, which both regard as critical for their survival
in the business of servicing a reduced fleet.
The government promised earlier this month that both dockyards would be kept
open, but the yard that does not acquire the nuclear order will inevitably
see its future as less prosperous and less secure. Rosyth declared 550
workers redundant earlier this week.
The latest move by Devonport, which took the Rosyth management by surprise,
is seen as a practical, if cheeky, attempt to shift the argument in its
favour. Detailed plans have been sent to the Ministry of Defence and the
Department of Trade and Industry for assessment.
The proposal suggests land at Rosyth originally reclaimed to build nuclear
submarine refitting docks should be used instead to refit oil tankers. An
independent analysis sponsored by DML, the private sector managers of the
Devonport dockyard, shows a need to rebuild the cargo sections of around 140
vessels from 1995 to extend their seagoing life.
The Braer oil tanker disaster off the Shetland coast has also increased
pressure for all tankers to be fitted with double hulls. DML believes up to
25 ships a year could be refitted at Rosyth.
Mr Mike Leece, managing director of DML, said: 'This is a classic example of
making swords into ploughshares. It also has export potential and
environmental advantages, and would provide the right work for the range of
skills at the dockyard.'
If taken up, the plan would allow Devonport to become more efficient by
taking a bigger part of the naval refit work, rather than sharing it with
Rosyth.
Mr David Batty, director in charge of defence work at Rosyth, said: 'We have
heard nothing about this . . . it is quite surprising that they (DML) have
the energy to devote attention to this sort of thing when they are trying to
provide value for money for the MoD down at Devonport.'

FT  25 FEB 93 / Council reporting rules may change

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL AUTHORITIES will be required to maintain registers of all their fixed
assets for the first time under new reporting rules proposed by the
Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.
In guidelines circulated this week the institute calls for an accounting
system that shows most fixed assets in councils' balance sheets at current
cost. The system would require all authorities to identify their assets and
have them regularly revalued.
The proposals are open to consultation until April 19 and are expected to be
endorsed by the Accounting Standards Board. They would become mandatory for
the 1994-95 financial year.
Mr John Scotford, the treasurer of Hampshire county council and chairman of
the committee which produced the proposals, said: 'The capital side of local
authority accounting just doesn't stand up to any kind of examination. It
does not attempt to show their worth or how they use their assets.'
The institute estimates that the one-off cost of the change would be Pounds
7m across England, Wales and Scotland, while further revaluations would
amount to Pounds 1m each year.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Anger in town halls as projects hit delays: Authorities
complain that government is blocking Brussels funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS, GILLIAN TETT and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL authorities in depressed areas throughout England and Wales are
strongly backing the European Commission in its row with the UK government
over the allocation of EC aid.
Anger and frustration is growing in town halls because of the risk that up
to Pounds 1bn in EC aid could be lost to projects in the country's worst-hit
regions because of the long-running conflict over distribution of the cash
from Brussels.
At the heart of the dispute is whether the various EC funds are additional
to member states' regional spending or whether governments - the UK in
particular - are using them to reduce the cost of capital programmes by
curbing local authority spending.
Mr Bruce Millan, the EC commissioner responsible for regional policy, is
becoming increasingly convinced, following protests from local authorities,
that the legal conditions for the distribution of aid are still not being
met.
The EC money should co-finance projects which would not otherwise go ahead,
and which should have 'a genuine additional impact in the regions
concerned'. Thus the long-running row is about what in EC jargon is called
'additionality'.
In its efforts to curb public spending the government has reduced council
borrowing levels in the relevant categories from Pounds 286m in the current
financial year to Pounds 208m in 1993-94, a cut of 27 per cent.
'What this means is that the government is reducing what local authorities
can borrow on other fronts in order that they can take up the European
money. This is what Mr Millan is so concerned about,' said the
Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities.
A broad range of councils and projects is affected. Cornwall County Council
is building a 2 1/2 -mile road at a cost of Pounds 10m with a 50 per cent
grant from the UK government, 25 per cent from the EC and the remaining 25
per cent funded by local taxpayers. However, it learned when the project was
under way that half the EC allocation was not being forwarded by the
government.
At the other end of the country Barnsley Borough Council in South Yorkshire
has seen its environmental and industrial development projects repeatedly
delayed by the wrangles.
Mr Richard Davies, director of economic development, said: 'We have had the
silly situation where we have had to cram three-year projects into a few
weeks because it has taken so long for the funding to come through.' He
added bitterly: 'The bottom line is that the Treasury has been taking away
the money from local authorities.'
One initiative which has been particularly hard hit is the Coalfields
Community Campaign - part of a three-year Europe-wide project known as
Rechar which provides aid for the regeneration of mining areas. Although
Britain was initially allocated Pounds 110m, nearly half the European budget
for the programme, its start was delayed for nearly two years in Britain
because the government failed to match the EC grant.
Ms Barbara Edwards, deputy director of the project, said: 'Everywhere else
in Europe they're powering ahead - the government accepts that they have to
pay up. But here nothing happened for over a year because the funds were
blocked.' She believes that the continuing rows could also delay the stage
of the project due to start next year.
Mansfield District Council, Nottinghamshire, which is also involved in the
Rechar project, added: 'We are three quarters of the way through the
programme, but the government is still talking about issuing guidance.'
A similar saga of confusion unfolds in the Midlands, where plans to develop
a railway line, backed by a 1992 EC grant, were held up by a lack of funds
to match potential EC grants, local officials said. Enough money has been
put together to start the line running north from Nottingham, but not enough
to take it to Mansfield and Worksop, Nottinghamshire.
Although the line is supported by the EC, the authorities involved are not
sure if the stations on it are eligible for grants. The government turned
down a grant for the line, thus, it was suggested, obstructing the
arrangement of matching funds.

LOCAL AUTHORITIES will be required to maintain registers of all their fixed
assets for the first time under sweeping new reporting rules proposed by the
Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.
In guidelines circulated this week, the institute calls for an accounting
system that shows most fixed assets in councils' balance sheets at current
cost.
The system would require all authorities to identify the assets they hold
and have them regularly revalued, at least every five years.
The proposals are open to consultation until April 19 and are expected to be
endorsed by the Accounting Standards Board this summer. They would become
mandatory for the 1994-95 financial year.
Mr John Scotford, treasurer of Hampshire county council and chairman of the
institute committee which produced the proposals, said: 'The capital side of
local authority accounting just doesn't stand up to any kind of examination.
It does not attempt to show their worth or how they use their assets.'
Local authorities have traditionally presented their accounts with the
emphasis on how assets are financed.
They have long resisted the move towards capital accounting primarily
because of fears about the costs of changing their systems.
The institute estimates that the one-off cost of change would be Pounds 7m
across England, Wales and Scotland, while further revaluations would amount
to Pounds 1m each year.
The new standards are an essential step in extending contracting-out of
local authority work to white-collar services. Town hall functions such as
architecture, planning and local tax collection could be contracted out
under legislation passed before the general election.
These functions cannot be subject to competitive tendering until councils
have introduced internal trading accounts which make costs more transparent.
Sharing overheads between different functions and the valuation of fixed
assets will be central.
The value of the assets has a further importance to the in-house team if
they are bidding against outside contractors for their work. With services
already subject to competitive compulsory tendering, the in-house team must
make a 5 per cent return on capital employed.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Building outlook varies by sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO contrasting outlooks for the construction industry emerged yesterday as
housebuilders reported on the continuing revival in the housing market while
contractors disclosed that orders for all types of construction fell steeply
during the final three months of last year.
Figures compiled from industry reports by the Environment Department showed
that total orders received by contractors for construction work in Britain
fell 10 per cent in the final quarter of last year, compared with the
corresponding period in 1991.
Private commercial work, mostly offices and shops, and private housing were
worst affected, with orders 28 per cent and 18 per cent lower respectively.
Total orders in 1992 were 5 per cent lower than 1991, said the department.
Builders, however, have reported a revival in sales since the new year with
a sharp rise in the number of buyers visiting show homes. A survey by the
House-Builders Federation published yesterday showed that three quarters of
builders expected to build more homes this year.
More than half the builders questioned reported a 'marked improvement' in
net reservations and site visits last month.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Rise in executive job offers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERCENTAGE of redundant executives receiving job offers is rising,
particularly in the south-east, Drake Beam Morrin, outplacement consultants
says.
A total of 16 per cent of out-of-work executives it counselled received job
offers in the first four weeks of the year - up from 10 per cent last year.
In the south-east the proportion doubled, from 9 per cent to 18 per cent
while in the Midlands it rose from 10 per to 17.6 per cent and in Scotland
and the north from 10 per cent to 16.2 per cent. The figures covered
executives earning from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 60,000.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Clinton's cuts could bite deeper: President under party and
public pressure to wield heavier axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton may introduce even deeper spending cuts in the
economic plan he presented last week as a result of pressure from public
opinion and conservative Democrats.
The White House wants Congress to pass a budget resolution locking in the
long-term spending cuts in the Clinton plan before it votes on the
short-term Dollars 16bn (Pounds 11.2bn) economic stimulus package that had
been its first priority. Both measures should come to a vote by early April.
The move is partly symbolic: the budget resolution only contains an outline
of future tax and spending plans, whose details will be incorporated in a
larger budget reconciliation bill later in the year. But it also reflects
the concern of fiscal conservatives, including many first-term members of
Congress, to demonstrate that they are serious about reducing the deficit
before they set about voting on a stimulus bill that will increase spending.
The plan includes Dollars 247bn of spending cuts and Dollars 246bn of tax
increases in 1994-97, but these are offset by Dollars 109bn of spending
increases and Dollars 60bn of tax breaks. Overall, the White House expects
the package to reduce the budget deficit from Dollars 332bn this year to
Dollars 206bn in 1997.
Mr Clinton has been telling audiences over the past week that he has only
just begun the task of cutting government spending; public feedback to
congressional offices around the country so far appears to favour pushing
ahead with this task immediately.
While the Republican opposition has criticised the overall plan for raising
taxes too much and cutting spending too little, most Republicans have so far
shied away from Mr Clinton's challenge to say which specific programmes they
would cut. Senator Trent Lott has resorted to theatricals, producing a
document which he claims contains a long list of spending cuts, but which he
will not show anyone.
White House officials say they have many more potential spending targets,
and the Congressional Budget Office has just produced a list of 249 specific
deficit-reducing measures, ranging from cancelling the space station and the
superconducting supercollider (saving Dollars 14.2bn over five years) to
eliminating federal subsidies for wool and mohair production (saving Dollars
580m over five years).
But Mr Clinton has already adopted many of these - although he has only gone
halfway on wool and mohair, saving Dollars 278m over five years by capping
subsidies at Dollars 50,000 per producer. Other cancellations, such as the
space station and the supercollider, have been floated and sunk by
opposition from the members of Congress whose states benefit from the
programmes.
This leaves Congress's deficit hawks, many of whom come from the south, with
an interesting political quandary. If President Clinton bows to their calls
for more spending cuts, they may find the pork-barrel projects and
agricultural subsidies they have fought for in the past are at the top of
his cutting list.

<TEXT>
COLOMBIA'S government has ordered top police and army units to Medelln to
mount the country's 'biggest single operation' to capture Pablo Escobar, the
fugitive cocaine king, Reuter reports from Bogota.
TV pictures showed helicopters and transport aircraft landing heavily-armed
troops in Medelln and the surrounding area of Antioquia Province where
Escobar is believed to be hiding.
President Cesar Gaviria has blamed Escobar for a campaign of car bombings
that have killed over 40 people in Medelln and Bogota in the past two
months, but claimed last week that security forces were finally closing in
on him.
Escobar escaped from jail last July during a bungled operation to transfer
him to a more secure prison. Despite a reward of Dollars 6.7m (Pounds 4.7m),
one of the highest ever offered by a government for the capture of a
criminal, he has remained at large.
A senior police officer said army commander Gen Hernan Jose Guzman and
deputy National Police director Octavio Vargas Silva had arrived in Medellin
to direct the operation.
Deputy Prosecutor-General Francisco Sintura also flew in amid tight
security, leading some to speculate that Escobar may be intending to
surrender.

FT  25 FEB 93 / US budget set to enter realm of realism: Vision of Change
may have to
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration must be delighted by the reaction of the US bond
market to the economic package unveiled last week. The stunning decline in
long yields - to well under 7 per cent - potentially provides a far more
important boost to growth than Mr Clinton's so-called short-term economic
stimulus.
But the package is selling less well on Capitol Hill, where many
conservative Democrats worry that the emphasis on tax increases and new
spending programmes could prove a political liability. And, unlike the bond
market, the Washington think-tank community is far from convinced that the
budgetary austerity promised towards the end of Mr Clinton's term will prove
sufficient to get the deficit under control.
Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, promised a package without the
customary 'smoke and mirrors'. He only partially succeeded. One of the most
misleading aspects of the plan is the claimed Dollars 30bn (Pounds 21.1bn)
short-term stimulus. What the administration has really done is draw a
circle around some of the measures and call that a stimulus; other measures
that will reduce demand, such as the rise in personal tax rates backdated to
January 1 this year, are excluded from these calculations.
The final table on the last page of A Vision of Change for America gives the
game away. This shows that policy changes will increase the structural
budget deficit (the deficit adjusted for the business cycle) by a negligible
Dollars 12.7bn in fiscal 1993 and reduce it by no less than Dollars 38.9bn
in fiscal 1994. In other words, fiscal policy will be contractionary to the
tune of Dollars 26.3bn over the next two years; the stimulus is thus almost
entirely an illusion, which is one reason, of course, why bond prices are
soaring.
In Washington, however, the main focus is on longer-term measures. 'The plan
does not solve the deficit problem once and for all. We will have to return
to this,' says Mr Rudolph Penner, economics director at accountants KMPG
Peat Marwick and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr Gene Steuerle, a former senior Treasury official now at the Urban
Institute, agrees. He says it is useless to pretend that a great deal of
deficit reduction can be achieved with a package that limits significant
spending cuts to defence and significant tax increases to the affluent. 'A
Dollars 150 energy tax is not a solution when you have a deficit per
household of Dollars 3,000 a year.'
The table showing changes in the structural budget deficit illustrates how
limited the administration's goals really are. Whereas past deficit-cutting
packages aimed to eliminate the structural deficit, the Clinton team is not
even trying to get it below Dollars 200bn, or close to 3 per cent of GDP.
After the election Mr Clinton said he would get the ratio of debt to GDP
back on a declining trend. Mr Steuerle's calculations, however, show the
debt/GDP ratio rising steadily - from 53.5 per cent this year to 56.6 per
cent in 1998.
The balance of the Clinton package is being attacked on several grounds. The
Centre for Strategic and International Studies points out that the plan
calls for Dollars 3-Dollars 4 of tax increases for every Dollars 1 of net
spending cuts. That compares with a ratio of Dollars 2.75 in spending cuts
for every Dollars 1 in tax increases advocated in a bipartisan
budget-cutting plan published by the centre last year.
But while sensitive to this argument, many Democrats also worry about the
timing of tax and spending changes. Tax increases take effect this year and
next, but significant spending reductions are delayed until after
congressional elections at the end of 1994.
Too often in the past spending cuts scheduled three or four years down the
road have failed to materialise.
The sheer momentum of spending programmes should not be under-estimated. The
Bush administration wanted to control spending, but over its four years
federal outlays actually rose 29 per cent in cash terms - in spite of a
sharp fall in real spending on defence.
The Clinton team is recommending Dollars 160bn of investment incentives and
new programme spending in areas such as infrastructure, education and
technology, yet projecting a total increase in federal outlays over four
years of only about 15 per cent - half the increase under President Bush.
Since spending on entitlement programmes is expected to rise by more than 20
per cent, the overall restraint is achieved only by projecting zero growth
over four years in discretionary programmes. Even allowing for deep defence
cuts, critics wonder if that is feasible.
There are also doubts about the revenue projections: the increase of roughly
one-third in marginal tax rates on wealthy individuals and on unincorporated
small business may lead to increased use of tax shelters and lower than
expected receipts.
Even allowing for faster economic growth than factored for in budget
projections, the view of many Washington experts is that Mr Clinton may have
to scale back his planned spending increases and investment incentives to
make his deficit-cutting package fully credible. In a reverse of historical
precedent it could just be that new members of Congress - the Ross Perot
class of 1992 - will force the president to be more realistic.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Illness casts doubt over defence secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LES ASPIN, the US defence secretary, remained in hospital yesterday with
heart problems and may have to reduce his workload when he is eventually
released, according to his aides.
Mr Aspin was taken to hospital on Sunday night suffering from acute
shortness of breath triggered by a reaction to a typhoid inoculation. He is
expected to make a complete recovery.
Nevertheless, his illness has amplified concerns about the vacuum of power
at the Pentagon, where Mr Aspin is the only senior official to have been
appointed so far by President Bill Clinton.
Mr William Perry, who has been nominated to be deputy secretary, has not yet
been confirmed by the Senate, and the acting secretary in Mr Aspin's absence
is a 'caretaker' left over from the Bush administration.
Mr Aspin's former colleagues in Congress had already begun, before his
illness, to criticise the slowness with which he has filled top positions at
the Pentagon. One member of the Armed Services Committee, which Mr Aspin
chaired for nine years, said he was more alone than General Custer at the
battle of the Little Big Horn.
In the hurry to produce a defence budget by the administration's March 23
deadline, Mr Aspin has already been forced to content himself with makeshift
cuts from the baseline proposed by his predecessors in the Bush
administration, rather than rethinking the missions and structures of the US
armed forces from the bottom up.
Mr Aspin had spent a 'good night' in hospital, according to an aide
yesterday, but it was not clear when he would be released.

THE US denied its soldiers or allies had killed anyone during riots in
Mogadishu yesterday, after reports had alleged American troops shot nine
dead in the Somali capital, Reuter reports from Mogadishu.
'According to Unitaf (the US-led task force), coalition forces were not
responsible for any of the deaths,' said Mr Joseph Snyder, State Department
acting spokesman.
He said he had seen news stories of nine Somalis killed in demonstrations
involving thousands of supporters of a Somali warlord who had tried to storm
the US and French embassies.
But the US had received unconfirmed reports of only three Somalis killed and
an 'undetermined' number of wounded.
Mr Snyder said the protests against the US were triggered in part by
'totally false' information that the US was taking sides among battling
warlords.
He said demonstrators put up barricades, burned tyres, threw rocks and
bottles and fired gunshots, but that the protests ended at midday.
Earlier the Defence Department said it could not confirm reports by
witnesses that US troops had killed at least nine rioters. Navy
Lieutenant-Commander Joe Gradisher, a Pentagon spokesman, said a US Marine
captain had been shot in the leg and that a Marine corporal had received
shrapnel wounds from a hand grenade.

ANGOLAN President Jose Eduardo dos Santos announced yesterday that he was
dismissing his finance minister and central bank governor following a
controversial move to narrow the gap between the official and black market
exchange rates, Reuter reports from Luanda.
A note from his office said minister Salamao Xirimbimbi and bank governor
Sebastiao Lavrador would be replaced temporarily by former planning minister
and current trade minister Emanuel Carneiro and deputy central bank governor
Generoso de Almeida.
The note did not detail reasons for the move. However, analysts said the
decision appeared to be linked to a controversial move several weeks ago to
abandon the official unrealistic exchange rate of 580 kwanzas to the dollar
and peg it closer to the black market rate.
The official rate, which covered some transactions including imports by
state bodies, was adjusted to 7,000 kwanzas to the dollar.
The move, which made the prices of some imported goods and services soar,
provoked criticism by local businessmen as well as some parliamentarians.
The black market rate jumped back to around 10,000 kwanzas after falling
back initially.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Nissan closure shocks workforce: Car company attempts one of
Japan's most radical restructurings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ON THE surface everything seemed calm yesterday at Nissan's Zama plant near
Tokyo. On the production line workers diligently assembled car parts to the
rhythm of nearby robots and the strains of Beethoven's Fur Elise ringing
from loudspeakers. But one phrase kept tripping off the tongues of Nissan
workers; bikkuri shimashita, we are shocked.
A day after Nissan announced its plans to close Zama in 1995, workers were
still trying
to come to terms with being caught up in the most radical restructuring
undertaken in the Japanese car industry.
To older Nissan workers the Zama closure represents the end of an era.
Japan's industrial success was built on plants such as Zama.
It was one of the company's main plants in the 1970s when Japanese cars were
flooding out into export markets around the world. At its peak in 1976 it
produced 956,000 cars and pick-up trucks.
In two years' time most of Zama's production will be transferred to an
ultra-modern plant on the southern island of Kyushu, which Nissan hopes will
be the centrepiece of its future.
Workers will be transferred from the grey, rusting Zama plant to Kyushu and
Murayama in Tokyo
Nissan plans to transfer 2,500 of its workforce of 4,000 to the two plants
in summer of next year in a desperate move to stem losses.
'It's really sad,' said Ms Saiko Tsushima, a 24-year-old guide who has shown
visitors around the Zama plant for six years. Japanese companies take pride
in giving employees security. But now Ms Tsushima admits: 'I don't know
what's going to happen.'
When the plant was built Zama was largely surrounded by fields. Now the
factory lies in the middle of a dormitory town, with thousands of
white-collar commuters travelling daily to Tokyo an hour away.
The growing popularity of Zama as a residential area seems to have given
Nissan all the more reason to let go of the site. Although some of the
company's research and development laboratories and a small-scale factory
will remain in Zama, most of the 853,000-sq metre site is scheduled to be
sold.
Nissan has promised job security to all plant workers. But most are facing a
transfer similar to a move from Essex to the highlands of Scotland.
The shock is being felt in the local community. 'Nissan's plant has been the
symbol of Zama since it was built,' said Mr Kunihiko Kawasaki, a local
businessman. Indeed, the Zama plant has been the pride of the community. Mrs
Thatcher, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and Mr Deng Xiaoping, the
Chinese leader, have all been shown the plant as a model of efficiency.
Zama city officials are worried about the expected decline in corporate tax
revenues. For the year which ended March last year, Nissan paid Y350m
(Pounds 2m) corporate taxes, some 20 per cent of Zama's corporate tax
income.
Local businesses are also deeply concerned, especially small, local parts
makers who are at the furthest reaches of Nissan's vast supply chain.
Nissan said it would start transferring its Zama workers in summer next
year. Mr Sotarou Mori, the general manager, sighs over the prospect of talks
with plant workers who face uprooting their families to keep their jobs.
But it is not the first time Mr Mori has done this kind of thing. It was
depressing, he reflected, that some of the management methods he last used
while on overseas postings for Nissan were finally coming to Japan.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Irish charm turns sour on Mulroney: Canada's premier pays
price of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S Mr Brian Mulroney yesterday became the latest western leader to
feel the public clamour for a fresh face at the helm of government.
Like Mrs Margaret Thatcher and Mr George Bush before him, the Canadian
premier is paying the price for presiding over a period of wrenching
economic and social adjustment.
Mr Mulroney's resignation after eight years as prime minister will be
greeted with cheers by many Canadians. Their dislike for him is so intense
that he had virtually no chance of restoring his reputation before the
general election which must be held within the next nine months.
Unpopular policies are only part of the reason why he sank to the lowest
standing in opinion polls of any Canadian premier in recent memory.
The same Irish charm and chattiness which make Mr Mulroney, 53, the life and
soul of a small party have turned out to be a handicap for a leader trying
to win sympathy from a surly electorate. His unctuous public-speaking style
and tendency towards exaggeration have compounded public mistrust.
History however, is likely to judge Mr Mulroney considerably more kindly
than recent opinion polls.
Many of the initiatives for which his government will be remembered have
imposed considerable pain. In future years these policies are likely to be
acknowledged as crucial to a badly needed revitalisation of Canada's
economy.
Mr Mulroney spearheaded negotiation of the US-Canada free trade agreement,
which took effect in 1989, and the North American free trade pact, including
Mexico, which is scheduled to be implemented on January 1 1994.
Lower trade barriers are forcing many Canadian companies to examine the way
they do business, from their production costs to their training policies,
plant locations and industrial relations.
After free trade, the biggest millstone around Mr Mulroney's neck has been
the 7 per cent goods and services tax, introduced in the depths of recession
in January 1991 as part of a broader tax reform. Despite the GST's
unpopularity, many Canadians - especially in the business community - are
grudgingly acknowledging that there may be no better alternative.
More recently, the Mulroney government has gingerly begun to tackle flaws in
Canada's generous but costly social security system.
Parliament is on the point of tightening the rules for unemployment
insurance. Ottawa is putting the finishing touches to proposals to revamp
welfare payments.
Unfortunately for Mr Mulroney, these challenges to hallowed pillars of
Canadian social and economic policy have coincided with - and to a large
extent been forced by - the longest and deepest recession since the war.
Unemployment is over 11 per cent, and business bankruptpcies are at record
levels.
The fall in tax revenues and heavier demands for government spending have
played havoc with the government's persistent promises to curtail the
federal budget deficit. The projected shortfall of CDollars 34.5bn (Pounds
19.30bn) this year is the highest since the Tories' early days in office.
However tight monetary policies - begun before most other industrial
countries - have brought inflation down to under 2 per cent.
The conventional wisdom is that Mr Mulroney's departure will do wonders for
the Conservatives' chances in the general election, expected to be called in
either September or October. The Conservatives will probably hold a
convention in June to pick a successor.
The leadership of both main opposition parties, the Liberals and New
Democrats, is weak. Signs are already surfacing that support is eroding for
two fringe groups, the Reform party in western Canada and the nationalistic
Bloc Quebecois in Quebec, which grew fast during the years of discontent
with the Mulroney Conservatives.
The new Tory leader will take over at a time when the economy is getting
back on its feet.
But even with a fresh face at their helm, the Conservatives have some
difficult political footwork ahead of them to ensure success. The key to Mr
Mulroney's success in the 1984 and 1988 elections was that he commanded
support both in English Canada and in francophone Quebec.
Although he failed to unite the country behind a new constitution, relations
between English and French Canada are calmer as he leaves office than for
several years. Mr Mulroney comes from the north shore of the St Lawrence
River, spent many years as a lawyer and businessman in Montreal and speaks
perfect French.
Quebec commands almost a quarter of the seats in parliament, and a solid
performance there is crucial for any party hoping to form a majority
government. None of the leadership candidates who have emerged so far -
defence minister Kim Campbell, communications minister Perrin Beatty, trade
minister Michael Wilson and environment minister Jean Charest - fits this
double bill.

NEW DELHI was braced last night for confrontation between the police and
militant Hindus planning to hold a banned rally in the capital.
The security forces detained thousands of supporters of the right-wing Hindu
Bharatiya Janata party, the main opposition group which is pressing ahead
with plans for a mass demonstration today in defiance of a government ban.
Police surrounded the city with checkpoints in an effort to stop
demonstrators flooding into Delhi and erected barbed wire around the fields
in which the BJP intends to stage the rally.
The BJP, whose supporters sparked nationwide inter-religious violence when
they stormed a mosque in Ayodhya, wants to press its demands for an early
general election.
Yesterday, BJP members disrupted parliament with angry condemnations of
alleged police 'atrocities' in arresting their supporters. The party claimed
more than 25,000 had been detained.
Mr Rajesh Pilot, a junior home affairs minister who is in charge of
security, pledged to maintain law and order 'at any cost'.
New Delhi police intend to deploy some 40,000 officers on rally duty, with
extra battalions sent from neighbouring states.
Some 8,000 paramilitary troops have been put on alert and the army has also
been put on standby, although it will only be used as a last resort.
Meanwhile, the government yesterday published its long-awaited white paper
on the destruction of the mosque at Ayodhya on December 6.
Its publication fulfilled a pledge given by Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister, in the hours after the attack on the mosque to give a full account
of the authorities' actions on the day, including the failure of the
security forces to protect the mosque.
The white paper absolves the central government from the failure and blames
the local provincial state government of Uttar Pradesh for refusing to
accede to Delhi's requests for the security forces to be sent into action.

<TEXT>
AN IRAQI anti-aircraft unit threatened to shoot down two United Nations
helicopters on a surveillance mission on Monday in an 'extremely serious'
new confrontation, the Security Council was told yesterday.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN weapons inspection commission said the
incident was part of Baghdad's 'salami tactics' of slicing away the scope of
UN operations.
Despite their past promises, the Iraqis had adopted a consistently negative
attitude towards helicopter missions.
Although Baghdad backed away from a serious confrontation in January in what
was seen as a goodwill gesture towards the new US administration, there
still had been 'no serious real change', Mr Ekeus said. 'I must say I have
not discerned much of a difference in tactics on the Iraqi government side.'
The latest incident occurred when UN inspectors led by the Russian Mr Nikita
Smidovich began a search for Scud missiles and related equipment. The Iraqis
are believed to have up to 200 Scuds, but Mr Ekeus said a search failed to
turn up any of 'the big stuff'.
Monday's mission which included two teams of inspectors was abandoned after
the Iraqis twice trained their guns on UN aircraft west of Baghdad.
Mr Ekeus stressed that UN resolutions authorised use of rotary-wing aircraft
anywhere in Iraq and the authorities were advised in advance of the
inspection operation.
There were 35 helicopter crews in Iraq and their safety was at serious risk.
An Iraqi official said they found nothing. A team leader declined to confirm
this but indicated the inspectors were leaving Baghdad empty-handed.
The UN believes Iraq is hiding missiles in defiance of the terms of the
ceasefire which followed its defeat in the Gulf war at the hands of a
multinational coalition.
Turkey yesterday confirmed that it planned to send a charge d'affaires to
Baghdad soon to reactivate its embassy closed since the Gulf war, Reuter
reports.
The diplomat, Mr Sadi Calislar, is expected to be sent to the Iraqi capital
early next month.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government yesterday promised to establish a committee to
draw up plans for constitutional reform if it wins the federal election on
March 13.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the committee would be asked to
produce options for the creation of a federal republic to replace the
existing constitutional monarchy. The undertaking, delivered at the formal
launch of Labor's election policies, represents the party's first move
towards the implementation of its decade-old commitment to the abolition of
the monarchy.
Mr Keating said Australians were beginning to question the relevance of the
1901 constitution under which Australia's head of state is the British
monarch. He said Australians should decide whether to abolish the monarchy
before 2001, the centenary of the federation of the continent's six former
British colonies.
However, he did not commit Labor to a referendum during the three-year life
of the next parliament.
Abolition of the monarchy is opposed by the Liberal/National party
opposition, which is leading the government by between 6 and 12 percentage
points in the opinion polls.
Mr Keating also promised extra spending of about ADollars 300m (Pounds
142.8m) on social benefits for low-income families, but the low-key policy
launch appeared unlikely to revitalise the government's flagging campaign.
Ralph Atkins adds: In London the Foreign Office refused to be drawn on the
issue. 'It is absolutely a matter for the Australians,' said an official.
Buckingham Palace also refused to comment.

THE VALUE of the Kenyan shilling fell sharply yesterday when a government
decision to let it float for the first time took effect, Reuter reports from
Nairobi.
Commercial banks quoted the currency at 57.85 to the US dollar, compared
with an official rate of 36.24 last Friday before the flotation.
The new rate was a devaluation of 59.6 per cent on last Friday's official
rate. The shilling was marked down by similar amounts against sterling, the
German mark and other major currencies.
The flotation allowed businessmen to buy foreign exchange for imports from
commercial banks instead of the Central Bank, ending a system under which
the Central Bank allocated import licences and currency to pay for goods.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG stepped up the pressure on China yesterday, vowing to publish
democratic reform legislation soon unless Beijing agrees to come to the
negotiating table, Reuter reports from Hong Kong .
Mr Michael Sze, secretary for constitutional affairs, said he hoped
Sino-British talks could start soon to end a long-running row over Hong
Kong's future which has shaken the colony.
He told the Legislative Council: 'We do recognise that the current uncertain
situation cannot be allowed to continue for much longer and that we will
need to gazette the bill if a decision on talks cannot be reached
imminently.'
Government-owned Radio Television Hong Kong reported that a bill based on
Governor Chris Patten's proposals, which have drawn Beijing's fury, would
appear in the official gazette tomorrow if China still refused to talk by
then.
A government spokesman refused to comment on the report, but Mr Patten
denied that he had presented Beijing with an ultimatum.
Speculation had raged that Mr Patten would miss a self-imposed deadline and
postpone publication of the legislation scheduled by the end of this month
to allow negotiations with Beijing.
But the governor said the arrangements for local elections in 1994 and
legislative elections a year later, at the centre of the dispute, had to be
agreed this year.
Referring to Mr Sze's statement, he said: 'That's not an ultimatum. What it
is, is a statement of what is an administrative imperative.'

FT  25 FEB 93 / Kim - reformer or political prisoner?: South Korea watches
and waits as delicate balancing act takes shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are two contrasting images of Mr Kim Young-sam, who will be
inaugurated today as South Korea's first civilian president since 1961.
One is the courageous dissident who challenged the country's military
dictatorship for almost three decades and saw his efforts rewarded with the
introduction of democracy in 1987.
The other is the skilful, and his critics would say opportunistic,
politician who abandoned the opposition in 1990 and joined his former
adversaries in the ruling party. The defection, which gave the ruling party
a parliamentary majority, eventually earned him the nomination as the
government candidate in the December presidential election.
The main question surrounding Mr Kim is whether his reformist tendencies
will predominate during his single five-year term, or will he be beholden to
the conservative political interests that helped elect him president.
Mr Kim is well aware of the contradiction. His campaign slogan was 'reform
amid stability' and his recent appointments reflect the delicate balancing
act he must perform.
Reformers were named to his personal staff in the Blue House, the executive
mansion, while conservative politicians are expected to hold most of the
cabinet postions under Prime Minister Hwang In-sung, a former general and
cabinet minister during the military dictatorship.
In many respects, Mr Kim's policies differ little from those of his
predecessor, Mr Roh Tae-woo. In foreign affairs, for example, he is expected
to maintain a tough stance against North Korea until it resolves suspicions
about its possible development of nuclear weapons.
The changes he proposes include making the government more accessible to the
public and removing the last vestiges of its authoritarian past. Mr Kim
would curb the power of the National Security Planning Agency, the
intelligence agency that harassed him and other dissidents during military
rule.
Another goal is to fight the corruption that plagues the government,
although that has also been promised by previous administrations to little
effect. The personal assets of senior officials, for example, will be
audited. One aspect of the anti-corruption campaign is the investigation of
bribes and illegal election funding by the country's large industrial
conglomerates, or chaebol, to gain business favours from the officials who
closely regulate the economy.
Partisan considerations, however, have apparently been a factor in recent
probes, which have focused on chaebol that opposed Mr Kim last year. Most
prominent has been the investigation of Hyundai and Mr Chung Ju-yung, its
founder, who stood against Mr Kim in the presidential election. Other
companies now under tax investigation for possible misuse of funds are
Pohang Iron and Steel and Daewoo Corporation, whose leaders also criticised
Mr Kim.
The new president, however, has dismissed speculation that he will dismantle
the chaebol in response to popular feeling against them. The public
considers the chaebol an obstacle to social equality because of their
economic dominance and the past favours granted to them at the expense of
the small business sector.
Indeed, Mr Kim has criticised as ineffective the credit restrictions imposed
by President Roh on the chaebol to curb their growth. He believes a radical
restructuring of Korea's industrial structure would harm the country's
economic performance, particularly when the nation is undergoing a difficult
transition phase from being a low-cost producer of bulk goods to a high-tech
manufacturer.
Instead, Mr Kim hopes to promote the chaebol's gradual dissolution by
enforcing anti-trust laws. Family ownership of these industrial groups would
be weakened by tougher inheritance taxes and the listing of all chaebol
subsidiaries, many of which are now privately held, on the Seoul bourse.
A key ingredient would also be deregulation, chiefly through reform of the
financial system, which remains the government's chief instrument in
managing the economy.
The government is expected to announce extensive financial liberalisation
next month and proposals for restructuring the inefficient banking sector
and other financial institutions by June.
But Mr Kim could face a hard time in implementing these changes since they
represent a loss of power for the bureaucracy and the political
establishment.
Mr Kim's advisers in the Blue House appear firmly committed to reform, but
he still must appease the conservatives within the ruling Democratic Liberal
party.
Whether Mr Kim has the strength and perseverance to push through the reforms
remains to be seen.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Somalis killed by US troops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE, Africa Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US TROOPS in Somalia killed at least nine people during rioting in the
Somali capital of Mogadishu yesterday by supporters of warlord Mohamed Farah
Aideed.
The outbreak of anti-US rioting may well mark the point at which things
start to go badly wrong for America's precedent-setting humanitarian
intervention. In the view of a rising number of Somalis, the US presence is
rapidly changing from an army of liberation into a force of occupation.
As in Lebanon in the early 1980s the US has inevitably come to be seen as a
partial player in the labyrinthine and vicious world of Somalia's rival
clan-based militias. Washington's authority and its willingness to use
greater force against armed gangs and bandits is being severely tested by
the armed factions.
The nine rioters shot dead were among thousands of protesters who erected
barricades of burning car tyres in the city and tried to storm the US and
French embassies.
The demonstrators - loyal to Gen Aideed, Somalia most powerful warlord  -
who two months ago thronged the streets to welcome US marines yesterday
chanted 'Go Home Americans' and 'Down with America'.
Angered about what they believe is US support for a rival warlord, the
protesters fought running battles with foreign troops.
The latest violence erupted after the clan-based militia led by Gen Mohamed
Siad Hersi 'Morgan,' the son-in-law of former dictator Gen Mohamed Siad
Barre, seized part of the southern port city of Kismayo from an ally of Gen
Aideed. Belgian and US troops stood by amid the clan fighting which claimed
at least 11 lives and left the city destabilised.
Despite a US ultimatum accusing Gen Morgan of criminal activities and
warning him to evacuate his forces from the city by midnight tonight, Gen
Aideed went on radio accusing the US of bias towards Gen Morgan. 'We don't
want a jihad (holy war) but events in the last few days are very
disturbing,' he said, threatening action unless the US stopped supporting
Gen Morgan.
The fighting in Kismayo, and inaction by the foreign forces, is a serious
blow to the operation. It has proved that the warlords remain highly armed,
powerful and determined to carry on with their conflict.
It has also exposed the lack of will among the US-led force to use their
superior firepower.
Memories of Beirut, where US marines had to beat an inglorious retreat in
1983 after a suicide bomber killed 242 troops, and of Vietnam continue to
cast a dark cloud over the US military intervention. US generals are anxious
not to take risks that might result in hefty casualties.
Political observers, however, say it was inevitable the US would get sucked
into the scheming and complex world of Somali politics it does not
understand.

<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government had been on the verge of announcing plans to open
its rice market to imports last month, a senior trade official admitted
yesterday, writes Charles Leadbeater. They had been shelved once it became
clear the prospects for an early Uruguay Round agreement had faded.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, had prepared a package to
liberalise the market after hinting in December last year that he supported
the move. It included financial measures to support farmers whose businesses
might have suffered as a result of allowing imports into Japan's tightly
regulated market. The measures would have been included in this spring's
special supplementary budget, designed to stimulate the Japanese economy.
'Mr Miyazawa was ready to come out of his castle waving a white flag to
surrender over rice, but. . . . he found the enemy had disappeared to do
other things,' the official said.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Questions of history and health for steel: The heat from the
political furnace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE Europe's major steel producers appealed to the European Commission for
help in the autumn, events have shown how steel, a commodity product in a
declining market, still retains its role as a political hot potato.
But, as European Community industry ministers meet today in Brussels to
discuss a rescue plan, some may well ask how the industry got into such a
mess.
The problems are well known - overcapacity fed by past subsidies, recession,
and east European imports in relatively small quantities but at low prices.
But how much overcapacity is there and where? And, if politics was put to
one side, which steel plants should be closed or merged? Here are some the
key questions:
How much overcapacity is there?
As calculated by the EC the industry's 'maximum production potential' last
year was 192.6m tonnes. But that includes at least 30m tons of mothballed or
moribund plant, and the effective capacity is 155m-160m tonnes. Production
last year was about 132m tonnes of crude steel, of which 110m-115m tonnes
goes to the European market.
What should the industry's capacity be?
Overall, says Mr Philip Tomlinson of the London-based Commodities Research
Unit, a realistic target for capacity utilisation would be 85-90 per cent.
That leaves some leeway if market conditions pick up. Taking the peak output
of 138m tonnes in 1989 as the maximum that the industry would ever need,
that would mean a cut of around 15m-20m tonnes in effective capacity.
Why are cuts necessary?
To prevent the industry from going bust. Producers cut output by 15 per cent
in the fourth quarter of last year but that is only part of the solution.
The steel industry, says Mr Peter Fish of the Sheffield-based MEPS Europe
consultancy, needs both to cut supply and capacity. In the flat products
sector in particular, where integrated plants are best operated
continuously, they cannot be profitable unless they run at 80-85 per cent
capacity. Says Mr Tomlinson: 'Plants need to be shut down for the industry
to make money. You can't tackle the issue just by getting plants to produce
at a lower level. In a commodity business it's flat out or stop.'
Where is the overcapacity?
Everywhere - in the production of hot steel itself, in hot rolling mill
capacity and in the main product sectors, long products and flat products.
The largest overcapacity, says Mr Edward Hadas of Morgan Stanley, is in
coated or galvanised steel used for car bodies, but demand is expected to
rise in the next three to four years.
In crude steel production and long products, overcapacity is linked to
changing technology. The biggest surplus, says Mr Hadas, is in the hot metal
phase, and while 5m-6m tons of capacity are being closed down, the situation
will worsen as mini-mills - small, flexible mills that make steel from scrap
 -enter the market.
In long products, Europe already has several mini-mills, particularly for
the production of concrete reinforcing rods known as rebars. Other long
products, notably heavy sections and beams, are still made by integrated
producers - in relatively few mills, but with excessive capacity.
Which plants should close?
Many of the worst-performing plants were swept away in the last recession.
In the unlikely event that efficiency, rather than politics, is the
criterion for cuts, a worst-case scenario closure list could be:
Spain - the entire industry except long product mini-mills
Italy - Ilva's grossly-overmanned integrated steel works at Taranto, unless
Mr Hayao Nakamura, the steel group's new managing director, can turn it
round quickly
Belgium - Cockerill-Sambre's melting capacity, described by one observer as
'structurally hopeless'. Its finishing facilities could be linked with the
melting side capacity of Sidmar, majority-owned by Arbed, to create a new
force in flat products
Germany - Klockner-Werke is operating under court protection from creditors,
and Krupp-Hoesch is warning that it might get out of steelmaking altogether.
In efficiency terms, the real problem is Ekostahl, the largest eastern
German producer. Based at Eisenhuttenstadt (iron smelter town) its closure
would be 'political dynamite,' says one analyst.
What is happening in the market place?
The fourth-quarter production cuts were followed up with price increases in
January. Flat product producers are optimistic they can make the increases
stick, although so little business is being done that it is too early to be
confident, says MEPS Europe.
But the long products sector has been transformed by huge Chinese purchases
and increased demand from the Far East.
'The Chinese are buying a lot of rebar, and the mini-mills have cut back
output to to go on to lower electricity tariffs,' says Mr Tomlinson.
Along with spiralling scrap prices, says MEPS Europe, this has enabled
European producers to achieve 'quite spectacular' price rises in their
domestic markets. Overall, however, there are few signs of any pick-up in
European demand.
What is likely to happen at today's meeting in Brussels?
There will be no formal decisions. Instead, industry ministers are expected
to give their political backing to the Commission's outline plan for
commercial and financial support of EC steelmakers. They will welcome the
prospect of voluntary closures, organised by the industry - partly because
they would prefer not to take the tough political decisions on capacity cuts
themselves.
Industry has already suggested cuts of up to 25.8m tonnes in crude steel,
and 17.9m tonnes in rolled products, but the Commission will consult again
with steel producers over the next two months to see if further capacity
cuts are possible. Brussels says the industry should be aiming to cut 30m
tonnes of crude steel capacity and 20m in rolled products.
Diplomats say today's meeting is merely the 'first phase' of the political
process. Indeed, the important decisions may not be made until October, when
ministers will have to decide whether the industry's closure plans go far
enough.

FT  25 FEB 93 / US senators seek Airbus 'dumping' action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO key US senators yesterday introduced legislation which would bring a
dumping and subsidy complaint against the European Airbus consortium and
would help fund a US technology consortium to develop the next generation of
US aircraft.
The legislation was introduced by Senator John Danforth, a leading
Republican on trade matters, and Senator Max Baucus, Democratic chairman of
the Senate international trade subcommittee. In a speech yesterday, Senator
Baucus also announced his support for a six-month to one-year extension of
the 'fast track' negotiating authority to allow completion of the Uruguay
Round this year.
'If we cannot conclude a Gatt agreement by the end of that time, we should
accept the fact that we are unlikely to get a good agreement,' he said.
The bipartisan aerospace initiative by the two senators comes in the wake of
strong criticism by President Bill Clinton of the Bush administration's
agreement with the Europeans to limit aircraft subsidies.
Senator Baucus said the government would not stand by while the largest US
export industry 'falls victim to a European aerospace industry that would
not even exist if it weren't for the treasuries of France, Spain, Germany
and the UK'. His legislation would create a consortium along the lines of
'Sematech', which funds semiconductor research with government and industry
financing. The bill also requires the Commerce Department to launch an
'unfair' trade case against the EC. The case would be dropped 'if an
agreement is reached'.
US and Japanese transport officials yesterday began two days of talks to
stave off sanctions and counter-retaliation in a dispute over a United
Airlines plan to fly from New York to Tokyo and Sydney.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission, the country's competition watchdog, yesterday
brought the first criminal charges under its anti-monopoly law in a case of
alleged bid-rigging.
The charges against four top printing companies said to have been involved
in rigging bids to supply the Social Insurance Agency follows domestic and
foreign criticism of the commission's failure to take legal action in past
cases.
The US government has persistently called on the commission to take tougher
action against any cartels which may block foreign companies' entry into the
Japanese market.
The commission provoked a storm of domestic criticism last year when it
failed to take legal action under the anti-monopoly law in a bid-rigging
case involving several construction companies.
The four printing companies, Dai Nippon Printing, the industry leader,
Toppan Moore, Kabayshi Kirokushi and Kitachi Information Systems have been
charged under Article 3 of the law which bans practices unfairly limiting
market transactions.
The four companies are alleged to have rigged bids to supply special seals
for pension documents, worth about Y6.1bn (Pounds 35.6m) between 1989 and
1992. It is thought the companies made excess profits of about Y1.5bn from
the deal. The specific charges relate to alleged bid-rigging between May and
September last year.
The FTC's action, which follows normal criminal proceedings against
executives from the companies involved, is unlikely to mark the start of a
more legalistic approach.
The commission decided on the legal action after the four companies had
ignored informal guidance to refrain from the alleged bid-rigging. The four
companies face the charges because they are seen to have flouted the
commission's authority.
If the companies are found guilty they could face fines up to Y10m (Pounds
58,000) each or their executives could be sentenced to prison terms of up to
five years.
In addition to the criminal charges, the FTC plans to impose administrative
penalties on the companies, which could include deducting profits. The
Social Insurance Agency has banned the companies from its contracts for two
years.

TRADE officials from about 30 countries yesterday began a fresh effort to
reach a Multilateral Steel Agreement to eliminate import barriers and scrap
most subsidies to the industry, Frances Williams reports from Geneva.
The two-day meeting will take stock of positions nearly a year after
negotiations broke down last March. Neither the US nor the EC is ready to
start striking bargains over the main issues in contention: allowable
subsidies and US recourse to anti-dumping and anti-subsidy action.
The Clinton administration has yet to issue policy instructions to US
negotiators, while the EC is largely preoccupied with the crisis in its own
steel industry.
The two sides plan bilateral consultations tomorrow over the recent US
imposition of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on steel imports from the
EC and elsewhere. This marks the first step on the road to establishment of
an independent disputes panel under Gatt.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Plan to open rice market shelved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government had been on the verge of announcing plans to open
its rice market to imports last month, a senior trade official admitted
yesterday. But the plans had been shelved once it became clear the prospects
for an early Gatt agreement had faded.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, had prepared a package to
liberalise the market after hinting in December last year that he supported
the move.
The plan included financial measures to support farmers whose businesses
might have suffered as a result of allowing imports into Japan's tightly
regulated market.
The measures would have been included in a special supplementary budget,
designed to stimulate the flagging Japanese economy and planned for this
spring.
'Mr Miyazawa was ready to come out of his castle waving a white flag to
surrender over rice, but when he emerged he found the enemy had disappeared
to do other things,' the official explained.
A Japanese promise to open the rice market would have helped clear the way
for a deal on agricultural subsidies, one of the main stumbling blocks to
the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Japanese officials believe that the opportunity to open the rice market has
passed for the time being because the prospects of an overall Gatt deal have
receded.

FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Crown Agents to buy food for Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's Crown Agents have been appointed by Japan's Foreign Ministry to
procure food for distribution in Russia as part of Japan's first emergency
humanitarian aid package to former Soviet republics totalling Dollars 100m
(Pounds 70.4m), David Dodwell writes.
Half the Dollars 100m has been earmarked for Russia, of which Dollars 25m
will be medicine and medical supplies distributed by the Japan Red Cross.
The Crown Agents are to procure about Dollars 25m-worth of food to be used
in 'monetisation programmes' in Russia, mostly in target cities such as
Irkutsk and Khabarovsk in the far east of the country. Funds will also go to
Yuzhino-Sakhalinsk, a city in the disputed territory of the Kurile Islands.
Under these programmes, consumers will buy food at below-market prices, with
the sales proceeds being used for under-privileged groups in Russia.
The Crown Agents were last year involved in a similar EC-funded scheme,
under which food aid worth Ecu1.2bn (Pounds 990m) was distributed in Moscow
and St Petersburg.

President Bill Clinton last night secured a general endorsement from Mr John

Martin in Washington.
After White House talks, Mr Major described air-drops as 'an imaginative
way' to bring relief. Earlier he said he was 'not remotely concerned' about
retaliation against British troops in Bosnia. Missions will be 'safe,
effective and will not draw the US into the military conflict,' said Mr
Clinton. He hoped other nations would join in the operation.
He said he did not expect the UK to participate since it 'has done its part'
by providing troops to help relief convoys get through.

FT  25 FEB 93 / German inflation turns downwards: Figures raise hopes of
another Bundesbank cut in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WEST GERMAN inflation has turned downwards again, encouraging fresh
speculation that the Bundesbank may further reduce lead interest rates as
early as next Thursday.
Preliminary figures from two key states, published yesterday, show the rate
of consumer price increases has slowed from 4.4 per cent in January to
around the 4.2 per cent forecast by most economists. Coupled with the
unexpected contraction in money supply growth in January and German
industry's accelerating plunge into recession, the news could encourage the
central bankers to reduce rates further.
Conditions for more cuts have improved since the Bundesbank's surprise
reductions earlier this month.
On February 4, after further tensions in the European exchange rate
mechanism, it reduced the discount rate by 0.25 of a point to 8 per cent and
the internationally sensitive Lombard rate by half a point to 9 per cent.
Since then Germany's public sector unions have accepted a 3 per cent pay
increase for this year, sending a clear signal that pay-driven inflation is
coming under control.
Following last week's news that last year's rapid growth in the M3 money
supply measure had not only slowed but fallen in January, economists have
revised their forecasts and believe M3 will stay within the Bundesbank's
target range for the rest of this year.
Political pressure on the bank is also continuing to protect the core of the
European monetary system by helping to protect the French franc.
Mr Ulrich Cartellieri, a director of the Deutsche Bank, yesterday stressed
the importance of defending the franc while at the same proceeding with an
orderly reduction in interest rates.
At each successive meeting the central bank council had come under increased
market pressure to reduce lending rates significantly, he wrote in an
article in Die Zeit.
The principal obstacles in the way of marked reductions remain inflation and
lingering doubts about the government's ability to deliver swingeing public
spending cuts and reduce the national deficit.
The Bundesbank wants the annual rate of consumer price increases down to 2
per cent, but the hard core of inflation, represented by rents and the cost
of services, is still not under control.
Yesterday's figures from Bavaria, where inflation is down to 4.2 per cent
compared with 4.4 per cent in January, showed the cost of rents and services
still rising at 6.2 per cent and 7.6 per cent. These two factors account for
more than 43 per cent of all consumer spending.
Inflation in North-Rhine Westphalia, meanwhile, dropped from 4.2 per cent to
4 per cent.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of Russians, Belarussians and Ukrainians believe the creation of
a free market economy is a step in the wrong direction, according to an
opinion poll, and that life was better under the old communist system.
But the same poll reveals that two out of three people in east and central
European countries which were not part of the former Soviet Union favour a
market economy. Albanians, Romanians, Lithuanians and Slovenians are
apparently the most enthusiastic about the free market.
Eurobarometer, the European Commission's pollsters, interviewed 1,000 people
in each of 18 east and central European countries last autumn and asked them
whether they felt a free market economy was 'right or wrong for their
country's future'. In 'European Russia', the poll found that only 37 per
cent of people favoured the free market route, and 44 per cent were against.
Russians are also hankering after the old political system: 59 per cent said
life was better before the political reforms.
In spite of their scepticism about the free market, the poll reveals that
most central and east Europeans believe the economic reform process should
be speeded up, and a majority - both within and outside the former Soviet
Union - called for acceleration of the privatisation process.
EC officials reacted with satisfaction to the poll's findings that a quarter
of people in the region, excluding Russia, see their future inextricably
linked with the Community, and 44 per cent are 'positive' about the EC.

FT  25 FEB 93 / 'Franc fort' takes toll on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE fragile state of the French economy was highlighted yesterday by news
that gross domestic product fell 0.5 per cent in real terms in the final
quarter of last year against the previous quarter, according to Insee, the
state statistics institute.
The figures, which reveal the first quarterly fall in GDP since the Gulf
war, come at a sensitive time for France's socialist government, which is
heading for defeat in next month's parliamentary elections. Until recently
the French economy had escaped the problems elsewhere in Europe.
The domestic market was sluggish throughout last year - due to the impact of
high interest rates on consumer spending and industrial investment - but
exports remained buoyant until the autumn.
However, the French government's franc fort policy of defending the franc
during the autumn currency crisis has made it difficult for French companies
to compete in markets with weaker currencies, such as Italy and the UK. This
problem was aggravated by the slowdown in Germany.
A number of large French companies, including Michelin and Renault, have
reported that exports came under pressure after the currency crisis. Insee
estimated that exports fell by 1.4 per cent in the final three months of
last year.
As a result GDP growth in 1992 slipped to 1.6 per cent, according to Insee.
This was an improvement on the 0.6 per cent increase in 1991, but below the
government's original forecast of more than 2 per cent.
The French economy is now at a critical stage. Activity is still affected by
the strong franc and high interest rates, raising the risk of another real
fall in GDP in the first quarter of this year and meaning that France would
technically be in recession. 'The outlook is very uncertain,' said Mr Didier
Maillard, chief economist at Paribas. 'We're forecasting static GDP for the
first quarter and we don't expect to see a recovery until the second half of
the year.'

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND'S finance minister, Mr Bertie Ahern, yesterday unveiled a 1993
budget which conceded slippage in the fiscal targets required for economic
convergence under the Maastricht plan for European monetary union. The
slippage is similar to that experienced by other EC states.
The ratio of government deficit to GDP will increase to 3.4 per cent, up
from 2.9 per cent in 1992, and while the debt/GNP ratio declined last year
to 103 per cent, it is now set to rise again in 1993 to 105 per cent as a
result of the currency crisis and increased borrowing to meet rising social
welfare bills.
Mr Ahern predicted GDP would rise by 2.5 per cent in 1993, half a point
lower than in 1992, while inflation would rise by half a point to 3.5 per
cent.
The budget calculations are based on an average sterling/punt exchange rate
of 1.02 through 1993 and a fall in interest rates of 3 per cent by the end
of the year.
Mr Ahern said: 'While I am committed to maintaining downward pressure on
public expenditure, it is clear the difficulties facing us cannot be fully
met by a combination of reduced expenditure and increased taxation this
year.
'Public expenditure will be kept under control. . However, there has to be
some increase in borrowing. An over-stringent approach would have damaging
effects on investment and employment.' The government's deficit target of
IPounds 1.033bn 'will be as close to the Maastricht deficit guideline as is
prudently possible in the present circumstances'.
The main features of the budget include increased provisions for health and
social welfare and an additional IPounds 500m capital spending programme,
part of which will be financed from EC funds.
On the revenue side, a temporary 1 per cent levy is to be put on all
personal incomes over IPounds 9,000, with a small widening of income tax
bands and a consolidation of VAT rates, leaving just two rates of 12.5 per
cent and 21 per cent.
There are also substantial excise duty increases on tobacco and cider.
Total taxation revenue is expected to rise by IPounds 126m as a result of
the budget measures.
Mr Ahern issued a strong warning to public sector unions that no further pay
increases will be contemplated in 1993, other than those already agreed.
Public sector pay will increase by 7.4 per cent this year.
Mr Ahern predicted that consumer price inflation would be 3.75 per cent this
year compared with 3 per cent last year. Unemployment would rise to 309,000
from 302,000 now.
He also said the government was willing to help Aer Lingus, the troubled
Irish carrier, saying any convincing recovery programme would be supported.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Air-drops to land in a political minefield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor, and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS At The UN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER the humanit-arian motives behind the US decision to parachute
relief supplies into east-Bosnia Moslem enclaves, such an operation entails
some very real political, and military, risks.
Although the US administration has indicated that it would also be dropping
supplies to isolated Serb and Croat communities in Bosnia, the general
perception that Washington is concerned mainly to help the Moslems is
unlikely to help the peace process.
That process, under the chairmanship of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, is
already in dire trouble following the failure of the leaders of two of the
three warring factions to participate in face-to-face talks in New York for
the past three weeks.
However, Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, was more optimistic yesterday when
he said the talks could be resumed 'no later than Monday'. The refusal of Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to return to New York as promised
has been attributed to concern about his security following the UN Security
Council's decision to set up a war crimes court and the actions filed
against him by three US human rights organisations.
This, however, seems to be only part of the story. His reluctance is almost
certainly motivated, too, by the realisation that US participation in the
peace talks can only increase the pressure on him to make compromises.
Despite this, reports from the UN last night said that Mr Karadzic was
expected to return to New York by the weekend.
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has also failed to turn up in New York,
or in Washington where he was due to meet Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president,
two days ago.
The Bosnian leader, whose UN delegate said yesterday was 'definitely
committed' to come, has made no attempt to hide his disappointment with
Washington's policy stance.
It was an open secret that President Izetbegovic and Mr Haris Silajdzic, his
foreign minister, hoped the US would announce military intervention on their
behalf. Instead, President Bill Clinton did little more than announce US
participation in a peace process already underway.
All the signs are that the Bosnian government, while welcoming the US
decision to parachute relief supplies, is still hoping the air-drops will
merely be the first step towards military intervention against the Bosnian
Serbs.
The risk is that the Moslems may try to bring this about by firing at the US
transport aircraft and making it look as if the Bosnian Serbs are
responsible for the attacks. Threatening noises from the Serbian side have
also underlined the risk of an escalation of the conflict, even though
Washington said yesterday that combat aircraft would not be used to escort
air-drops.
If the US operation is no more than a 'one-off' action, and is carried out
without incident, it could possibly help the long-term peace process. It
would answer the Bosnian government's complaint that the international
community is not doing enough to alleviate the Moslems' suffering and would
thus deprive it of a pretext for not attending the peace talks.
For the moment, however, the mutual suspicions and recriminations that the
intended air-drop has aroused have merely complicated a peace process which
was already in the doldrums.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Lira feels effects of confidence vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UNCERTAINTIES over the outcome of the vote of confidence on the weekend
cabinet reshuffle by the Italian prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato,
yesterday pushed the lira to historic lows against all main currencies.
But in the highly volatile atmosphere of Italian politics, with parties
battered by the national corruption scandal and riven by internal
differences, Mr Amato yesterday appeared to have clawed back essential
support.
Both his own Socialist party and the Christian Democrats, the dominant
partners in his four-party coalition, indicated they would back him in the
vote due today.
On Tuesday elements within both parties had hinted that they might withdraw
their backing in the vote which was called by the 54-year-old prime
minister.
The prospect of the government falling without a clear replacement for the
prime minister yesterday forced the lira at one stage below the L990 level
against the D-Mark. The lira ended last week at L963 following the
resignation of the finance and health ministers which forced Sunday's
cabinet reshuffle. Since last September's currency crisis when the lira was
forced to float, the Italian currency has devalued almost 30 per cent
against the D-Mark and even further against the dollar.
The lira has now depreciated to levels which the Bank of Italy regards as
unrealistic. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the bank's governor, commented
yesterday: 'The present quotations of the lira are obviously undervalued and
completely out of line with the state and prospectives of the Italian
economy.'
Dealers said yesterday that if the main political parties in the coalition
continued to show signs of less than whole-hearted support for the Amato
government the markets were bound to be nervous.
The authorities are concerned that further devaluation of the currency at
these levels could affect prices. Preliminary figures for February suggest
that the continuous downward trend in inflation since the second half of
1992 has been interrupted and that the first effects of devaluation are
beginning to work their way through - despite the deepening recession.
The confidence debate, which began yesterday, is due to wind up today. But
there are also moves to have the process repeated in the Senate.
Mr Amato antagonised the party rank and file by failing to consult
sufficiently over the reshuffle.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Russia's love affair with west ends in disappointment:
Moscow is counting the cost in foreign policy terms of trying to live up to
western expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RUSSIAN foreign policy has changed significantly
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
though not dramatically - from the solidly pro-western stance that followed
the collapse of the Soviet Union. It is no longer a matter of loving
everyone. Finally, even belatedly, foreign policy is governed by the
national interest and nationalist pressures.
There is now a clear effort to define the national interest of a state
struggling with economic crisis, with a vast land mass straddling Europe and
Asia, and with a larger inheritance from the Soviet Union than first thought
 -of debt, alliances, and trade links.
Both President Boris Yeltsin and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister,
have been concerned to emphasise the 'Eurasian' identity of Russia - a
concept borrowed from those who last year opposed what they felt was the
uniquely pro-western drift of policy. Mr Yeltsin's most recent state visits
have been to China and India and the trade and political agreements he
signed there were represented as great successes. However, he took care,
especially in India where arms sales have been publicly frowned on in the
west, to assert Russia's independence, especially from US tutelage.
Ministers are now making more clear the costs of their pro-western stance.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of foreign
economic relations, has told foreign officials that Iraq has informed Russia
that if the latter drops its support for sanctions, Baghdad will begin to
pay the billions of dollars it owes for arms. For a country as desperate for
hard currency as Russia, this is, as Mr Shokhin stressed, not easy to
dismiss. Nor is it an offer that a future government of Russia, lacking the
convictions of Mr Shokhin's, would dismiss.
The conflict in the former Yugoslavia also increasingly shows the strains
and limits of Russia's new consensual approach.
Mr Kozyrev says that Moscow would want to drop sanctions against the fellow
Slav state of Serbia as soon as it became clear that its leadership was
genuinely trying to seek a peaceful solution: it also would press for
sanctions against Croatia if it continued aggressive action. This runs
counter - though not directly so - to the early indications from the Clinton
camp that harsher action would be taken against the Serbs. But it has won Mr
Kozyrev grudging agreement from Mr Yevgenny Ambartsumov, the formerly
critical chairman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs.
The most acute 'foreign' problems and tensions facing Russia at the moment
are those with the fellow former states of the Soviet Union and now of the
Commonwealth of Independent States. General Pavel Grachev, the defence
minister, said yesterday in an interview in Izvestia that while Russia had
no enemies in the world, it had to strengthen its border security,
particularly with the Caucasian states: not surprisingly, since the only
state in the world which regularly claims to be at war with Russia is
Georgia, which suspects Moscow of aiding the separatists in the
north-western province of Abkhazia.
Gen Grachev also stated, flatly, that Russian troops would not be taken out
of Abkhazia - that is, of Georgia - because 'otherwise we would lose the
Black Sea'. This automatic assumption of the continuing need to project
military power into other countries to secure what were Soviet, or even
Tsarist, borders is common, and more commonly voiced.
The quarrel developing once more between Russia and Ukraine over energy
supplies, spreading to include the gamut of territorial and military points
of conflict between them, is actually a threat to world peace - since both
are nuclear powers. Though they have always stepped back from the brink, the
underlying tensions are not solved and their situations are worsening.
This closing in on itself, a concentration on problems in the 'near abroad',
comes at a time when distrust, or at least disappointment, in the
performance of the west is high. The International Monetary Fund strategy
that would have brought Dollars 24bn (Pounds 16.9bn) into the country is
seen to be stillborn. Western investors have not come in large numbers and
it is clear there is no relief from the new friends. This makes many
question whether they are really friends; and even pro-western politicians,
like Mr Kozyrev, are cautious.
Mr Kozyrev seems to prefer an ad hoc, increasingly moderated, liberalism to
the enunciation of a defined policy line. This approach has allowed him, so
far successfully, to defuse the issue of the 25m Russians living in other
former Soviet republics through a series of bilateral talks and agreements.
If he has had to shift to accommodate the nationalist pressures, he has so
far been able to confine it to minimal movements.
This will be a hard line to retain. Indeed, Mr Kozyrev himself, more
unpopular than most ministers, may be hard to keep within the government. In
part, Russia's size, interests, and present poverty dictate a retreat from
the cuddly idealism of its first position. However, the harder spirits are
winning out in some areas of policy, and may have further victories yet.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of Russians, Belarussians and Ukrainians believe the creation of
a free market economy is a step in the wrong direction, according to an
opinion poll, and that life was better under the old communist system.
But the same poll reveals that two out of three people in east and central
European countries which were not part of the former Soviet Union favour a
market economy. Albanians, Romanians, Lithuanians and Slovenians are
apparently the most enthusiastic about the free market.
Eurobarometer, the European Commission's pollsters, interviewed 1,000 people
in each of 18 east and central European countries last autumn and asked them
whether they felt a free market economy was 'right or wrong for their
country's future'. In 'European Russia', the poll found that only 37 per
cent of people favoured the free market route, and 44 per cent were against.
Russians are also hankering after the old political system: 59 per cent said
life was better before the political reforms.
In spite of their scepticism about the free market, the poll reveals that
most central and east Europeans believe the economic reform process should
be speeded up, and a majority - both within and outside the former Soviet
Union - called for acceleration of the privatisation process.
EC officials reacted with satisfaction to the poll's findings that a quarter
of people in the region, excluding Russia, see their future inextricably
linked with the Community, and 44 per cent are 'positive' about the EC.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Brussels to tighten up safety at sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday called for stricter implementation of
international rules on safety at sea to prevent a repeat of recent oil
tanker accidents.
The Commission said it would introduce legislation before the end of the
year which will oblige member states to observe minimum rules on safety,
ship maintenance and training which have already been set by the
International Maritime Organisation (IMO).
But Brussels stopped short of proposing measures which would give the
Community new maritime safety standards stricter than those already in place
under IMO regulations.
Mr Abel Matutes, EC transport commissioner, said yesterday that the main aim
was to enforce existing rules. 'There's a great deal of leeway between
adopting an international convention and actually applying it: that can lead
to a lax approach, which can lead to accidents,' he said.
The Commission also said it would be up to member states to propose and
enforce measures protecting environmentally sensitive areas from shipping.
Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the EC environment commissioner, said: 'There is no
map (of such areas). It isn't up to the Community to do that. This is under
national juris-diction.'
The paper published yesterday lays out 'a common policy on safe seas' and
will be submitted to EC transport ministers next month for political
backing. The Commission has been working on the paper for some time, but
speeded up publication following the oil tanker accidents earlier this year
at La Coruna, in northern Spain, and in the Shetland islands.
Mr Matutes said the introduction of any subsequent legislation would be
co-ordinated with the IMO, but he also made clear that the Commission would
press for all shipping to be subject to stricter checks.
The Braer, the tanker which broke up in the Shetlands in January, was in
transit through an international navigation lane. The Commission document
calls on IMO member states to establish 'beyond doubt' that vessels in
transit through such shipping lanes should report to coastal states about
their cargo.
Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, the British shipping company, and president
of the European Community Shipowners Association (ECSA), welcomed the report
yesterday, but warned the EC against developing 'a regional approach' to
maritime safety. 'Regional EC regimes would be both counter-productive in
terms of safety and competitively unfair for European shipowners,' he said.
The Commission said its legislative proposals would include minimum training
requirements for seafarers, minimum reporting requirements for vessels
carrying dangerous and polluting goods, common rules on technical safety
standards, and the establishment of a 'committee on safe seas'.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Heseltine clears travel merger against advice: OFT
over-ruled twice in two weeks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, RICHARD GOURLAY, DAVID OWEN and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday over-ruled
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, for the second time in
two weeks, and approved a proposal which would create a travel company with
30 per cent of the UK market.
Mr Heseltine's surprise decision to dismiss Sir Bryan's recommendation that
the Pounds 225m bid by Airtours' for its rival holiday company, Owners
Abroad, be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission was attacked by
recession-hit independent operators which said it could force them out of
business.
The decision was also criticised by consumer groups, competition specialists
and Labour, which said the case for a referral to the MMC was overwhelming.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, described the decision as
'astonishing'. He said: 'For Mr Heseltine to disagree with the
director-general is a slap in the face and little short of a vote of no
confidence in Sir Bryan Carsberg.'
He called for an inquiry into 'behind-the-scenes activities' concerning the
bid in the Department of Trade and Industry. 'It is clear that the DTI
interfered with the Office of Fair Trading's pre-bid guidance as far back as
December,' he said. 'The public has a right to know why the DTI ignored the
pre-bid advice the OFT gave.'
Earlier this month, Mr Heseltine overturned a recommendation from Sir Bryan
that a merger of the infra-red defence components businesses of GEC and
Philips Electronics be examined by the MMC. Before that, the
director-general's advice to refer a merger had been over-ridden only 11
times in 20 years.
However, the OFT said that since Sir Bryan was appointed in June last year
Mr Heseltine had waved through 91 recommendations.
Mr Heseltine said the competition issues raised by the Airtours takeover
were not sufficient to justify a reference. Last Friday, he received a
report from the OFT saying that the proposed takeover warranted examination
by the MMC.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said: 'We are delighted by this
decision. We remain firmly of the view that the combination of Airtours and
Owners Abroad will prove beneficial to both consumers and shareholders
alike.'
Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour
Operators, said: 'The Office of Fair Trading have investigated the situation
thoroughly and advised that the MMC be involved. We are extremely disturbed
that the views of those experienced in and knowledgeable about the industry
have been totally ignored by Mr Heseltine.'
Mr Heseltine's decision throws the spotlight back on to Owners Abroad, which
must produce its final defence against Airtours' bid this week. The
all-share offer currently values Owners Abroad at 114p and its partial cash
alternative at 110p, below the 129p level at which its shares closed
yesterday, up 13p on the day. Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman,
yesterday repeated his claim that the Airtours offer undervalued his
company.
It emerged last night that Mr Neil Hamilton, the minister at the DTI with
responsibility for competition issues, stepped aside from looking at the bid
on February 15, after receiving a letter from Mr Crossland, who is one of
his constituents in Tatton, Cheshire. The DTI said Mr Hamilton stepped aside
to prevent people 'misinterpreting the situation'.
Mr Griffiths questioned the part played by Mr Hamilton. 'There must be an
investigation into the role of the minister and what part he played during
December, January and the first week of February,' he said.
'I understand he did not declare the interest formally, but his withdrawal
was the honourable thing to do. However, he will want to explain why no
conflict of interest was formally declared to parliament or made public.'

FT  25 FEB 93 / Duke of Westminster quits Tories over lease reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Duke of Westminster, widely believed to be Britain's richest man with
wealth estimated at up to Pounds 3.5bn, has left the Conservative party. He
resigned in protest at the government's plans to change leasehold law in a
way that cuts across existing private property rights.
The duke, whose family has been associated with the Conservative party since
its beginnings, has resigned after 20 years as president of his local
Chester Tory party, having become convinced that the government's plans
would take effect.
'I cannot morally stay within a party which I fundamentally believe has
ideologically gone off the rails,' he said yesterday.
The government is promoting a bill which would allow holders of long leases
to buy the freehold of the property.
Ministers estimate that some 750,000 long leaseholders will benefit from the
reforms and say that landlords will not be treated unfairly since the
tenants must pay the market price for the freehold of the property. But the
bill has sparked deep opposition from some senior Tories, who say that it
interferes in property rights in a way that its critics see as more typical
of a Labour than a Tory administration.
The duke's vehement hostility to the proposals has been apparent for many
months, and he was among those trying to prevent them being incorporated in
the party manifesto last spring.
In a speech last month to the British Property Federation, he said: 'The
implications of this legislation are fundamental in a country which has no
written constitution and relies on parliamentary precedent . . . Because
this law interferes with basic liberties, it should send shivers down all
our spines.'
His decision to resign was taken after great soul-searching and 'in sadness
rather than anger', one of his staff said yesterday. She added that he did
not intend it to influence the course of the bill and that if the government
were to drop it, she did not think he would rejoin.
'We felt pleading with him to change his mind wouldn't be appropriate,' Mr
Stephen Maund, Tory local agent, said yesterday, expressing his regret at
the decision.
News of his resignation earlier this month came the day after the House of
Lords first discussed the bill. The duke was present for Tuesday's debate,
but had to sit on the steps of the throne rather than with other peers
because he has not taken the oath of allegiance yet this session.
If he takes the oath in time to take part in the future, detailed debates on
the bill, he will sit on the cross-benches with the independent peers,
rather than with his former Tory colleagues.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Clinton gives Gatt pledge to Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday sought to reassure European leaders that
the new US administration would not retreat into protectionism by telling Mr
John Major that he would put a 'real effort' into a successful conclusion of
the Uruguay Round of world trade talks.
After a first face-to-face encounter between the two leaders at the White
House dominated by trade issues and Bosnia, Mr Clinton offered also a public
commitment to preserve the so-called special relationship between London and
Washington.
Speaking after their talks, the president brushed aside suggestions that his
relations with Mr Major had been soured by Conservative help offered to Mr
George Bush's presidential campaign. He joked that British Home Office files
dating from his student days in England had remained secret.
Earlier Mr Major had dismissed suggestions that relations between Washington
and London would be damaged by the arrival of a Democratic administration.
He said differences between the two governments were 'tiny' compared to
their shared interests.
To the relief of his guest, Mr Clinton appeared willing to play down, in
public at least, the significance of his plans to send an emissary to
Northern Ireland to investigate the potential for a peace settlement. He
insisted that the US was keen to play a 'constructive role' in promoting a
political settlement.
Earlier, potential for friction on Ulster had been underlined by a demand
from more than 50 Democratic members of Congress that President Clinton
raise with Mr Major what they termed 'human rights abuses' by the security
forces in the province.
Two senior senators - Mr Edward Kennedy and Mr Daniel Moynihan - signed
letters sent to President Clinton calling for the administration to play an
active role in protecting the minority Catholic population.
Mr Major, speaking at a joint White House press conference, said that the
human rights abuses that concerned him were those inflicted by the
terrorists, often on innocent civilians.
But he left open the possibility that in a second meeting with the president
over dinner last night the two would agree on the terms for an Ulster
fact-finding mission by a senior US politician.
The prime minister was visibly cheered by Mr Clinton's public commitment
that he 'would put a real effort into a successful conclusion of the Uruguay
Round. Mr Clinton, underlining the importance of close co-operation between
the US, Japan and Europe to prevent a further contraction of the world
economy, added he was 'very hopeful' the negotiations would succeed.
Senior British officials said they expected the administration to underpin
that urgency by extending for the so-called fast-track procedures for
congressional approval of a Gatt deal.
Neither leader, however, offered any hint of an early solution to the
disputes between the US and Europe over Airbus subsidies, US tariffs on
steel and Washington's plans for higher duties on imports of sports utility
vehicles.
Mr Clinton's plan to air-drop supplies into eastern Bosnia was publicly
endorsed by Mr Major. Despite private reservations in London about the
practicalities of such an operation, Mr Major called it an 'imaginative'
contribution to the peace effort.

FT  25 FEB 93 / ICI will announce split and Pounds 1bn rights issue today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries will today announce it intends to carry out the
biggest restructuring in UK corporate history by splitting itself into two
separately listed companies and raising Pounds 1bn through a rights issue.
The new money will be raised through a newly created company, Zeneca,
containing ICI's pharmaceutical operations, confounding the widespread
rumours that ICI itself would make the rights issue.
Following a board meeting held yesterday to finalise the details of the
demerger, the group will today say it intends to give shareholders one
Zeneca share for each ICI share they currently hold. Investors will also be
asked to subscribe for additional Zeneca shares, to raise about Pounds 1bn.
That could make the deal the second biggest rights issue in UK corporate
history, lagging behind the 1987 BP issue.
The demerger and money-raising process is likely to take a couple of months.
It will be orchestrated by SG Warburg, the group's financial adviser.
Warburg decided that the most efficient way to raise Pounds 1bn was through
Zeneca. However, before the demerger, Zeneca will inject an equivalent sum
into the rump of ICI, so that this traditional chemicals business can
prosper during the recessionary trading conditions.
Brokers are forecasting that Zeneca will make pre-tax profits of more than
Pounds 500m in the current year and that ICI profits would be less than half
that level.
ICI and its advisers are braced for criticism from some of its shareholders
about the proposal to demerge, so they have prepared a detailed marketing
campaign.
The most widespread concern in the City is that Zeneca is not quite big
enough to compete with the world's biggest drug companies.
The company has been contemplating a demerger for almost two years. In July,
it announced plans to split, but since then doubts have emerged in the City
about whether it was possible.
But ICI's executives, led by the chairman, Sir Denys Henderson, and the
chief operating officer, Mr Ronnie Hampel, have been debating the plan in
great detail with the non-executives, who include Mr Paul Volcker, former
chairman of the US Federal Reserve, and Sir Jeremy Morse, former chairman of
Lloyds Bank.
Yesterday a board meeting at the group's London headquarters gave approval
for the demerger to go ahead.
ICI will also disclose its 1992 results today. Brokers believe that its
pre-tax profits fell last year to around Pounds 550m, compared with Pounds
843m in the previous year.
However, the group is expected to maintain its dividend. Its share price
rose yesterday from Pounds 10.74 to Pounds 10.82, valuing the group at
Pounds 7.73bn.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Major plays down differences in first meeting with Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night sought to underpin British relations with the new
US administration in a first encounter with President Bill Clinton dominated
by trade issues, the continuing crisis in Bosnia and the precarious progress
of economic reform in Russia.
As the prime minister met Mr Clinton at the White House, he brushed aside
suggestions that foreign and economic policy shifts under the new
administration would undermine the close relations established during 12
years of Republican rule.
Describing his differences with the US administration as 'tiny' compared
with their shared interests, Mr Major was clearly relieved at the White
House's apparent willingness to play down the help offered by the
Conservative party for former President George Bush's election campaign.
However, new sources of friction between Washington and London emerged with
demands from nearly 50 representatives and senators for Mr Clinton to play
an active role in the affairs of Northern Ireland.
In letters sent to the president to coincide with Mr Major's visit, the
members of Congress, including Senators Edward Kennedy and Daniel Moynihan,
referred to continuing 'human rights abuses' by British security forces in
the province.
The charge, dismissed by senior aides travelling with Mr Major, put a new
focus on President Clinton's campaign pledge to send an emissary to Ulster.
Yesterday Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the House of Representatives, said he had
not been approached by the president to carry out the task.
Mr Major set as his priority for the White House talks to persuade President
Clinton to give new momentum to the stalled Gatt world trade talks. After a
series of meetings with senior administration officials, including Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, the prime minister emphasised to Mr Clinton
the dangers of a long extension of the deadline for 'fast-track'
congressional approval of a global trade deal.
Mr Major wants the extension planned by Mr Clinton to last no more than six,
or at most, nine months to ensure the momentum of negotiations is
maintained.
Reviewing with Mr Bentsen the agenda for Saturday's meeting of Group of
Seven finance ministers in London, Mr Major stressed that completion of the
Uruguay round of trade talks would provide the most powerful boost available
to the world economy.
Mr Major dismissed fears that Mr Clinton's recent rhetoric on trade issues
heralded a new retreat into protectionism by Washington. But he voiced
European fears that new US tariffs on steel imports and a threat to impose
higher tariffs on 'sports utility vehicles' could lead to 'tit-for-tat'
retaliation.
The planned tariff on imports of utility vehicles would threaten Land Rover
of the UK's sales to the US, even though its prime aim would be to restrict
Japanese imports.
In foreign policy discussions dominated by Bosnia and the former Soviet
Union, Mr Major suppressed private scepticism to offer backing for Mr
Clinton's plan to air-drop humanitarian supplies into eastern Bosnia. But he
stressed Britain's view that resumption of the stalled peace talks between
the warring factions in the former Yugoslav province offered the only
durable prospect for a settlement.

FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Earnings are revised down at
Siam Cement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIAM Cement, the largest cement producer in Thailand, yesterday disclosed
that its audited net profit in 1992 was substantially lower than the
unaudited profit figure announced last month.
The audited, unconsolidated figures showed net profit of Bt3.56bn (Dollars
142m), more than Bt400m below the previously announced sum of Bt3.98bn, and
also below the Bt3.89bn made in 1991.
The discrepancy is largely due to higher operating expenses. According to
Siam Cement's audited statement, operating costs were Bt5.38bn in 1992,
higher than the unaudited figure of Bt4.96bn.
A Siam Cement official told Reuters that the revision of costs was partly
related to investment in its new Khao Wong plant, one of the world's largest
cement factories; it cost nearly Bt10bn and has a capacity of 3.6m tonnes a
year.
Investors were disappointed with Siam Cement's 1992 performance even before
yesterday's announcement. Yesterday, the shares closed unchanged at Bt488 in
a rising market.
The cement shortages which characterised the Thai construction boom of the
late 1980s have given way to overcapacity in the industry, with newcomer TPI
Polene investing heavily in new plant.
Demand for cement in Thailand is now estimated to be growing at a modest 4
to 5 per cent a year, after 18 per cent only a year ago, but is likely to be
boosted by numerous projects to improve transport and other infrastructure,
including the construction of a new Bangkok airport, in the years ahead.
Siam Cement's unconsolidated sales in 1992 slipped to Bt33.35bn from
Bt33.80bn in 1991.
The company also declared an unchanged final dividend yesterday of Bt9 a
share, making a maintained total of Bt18 for the year.

THOMAS Cook, the travel and financial services company controlled by
Westdeutsche Landesbank, yesterday reaffirmed its commitment to a proposed
tie-up with Owners Abroad, writes Richard Gourlay. 'We are fully committed
to the alliance,' it said. It was the best deal for Owners' shareholders and
for LTU, the German travel company also part of WestLB's travel interests.
This proposed alliance would allow Owners Abroad to market its holidays
through Thomas Cook travel agencies and would lead to savings for the two
companies of at least Pounds 15m during two years.

FT  25 FEB 93 / Nissan closure shocks workforce: Car company attempts one of
Japan's most radical restructurings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE surface everything seemed calm yesterday at Nissan's Zama plant near
Tokyo. On the production line workers diligently assembled car parts to the
rhythm of nearby robots and the strains of Beethoven's Fur Elise ringing
from loudspeakers. But one phrase kept tripping off the tongues of Nissan
workers; bikkuri shimashita, we are shocked.
A day after Nissan announced its plans to close Zama in 1995, workers were
still trying
to come to terms with being caught up in the most radical restructuring
undertaken in the Japanese car industry.
To older Nissan workers the Zama closure represents the end of an era.
Japan's industrial success was built on plants such as Zama.
It was one of the company's main plants in the 1970s when Japanese cars were
flooding out into export markets around the world. At its peak in 1976 it
produced 956,000 cars and pick-up trucks.
In two years' time most of Zama's production will be transferred to an
ultra-modern plant on the southern island of Kyushu, which Nissan hopes will
be the centrepiece of its future.
Workers will be transferred from the grey, rusting Zama plant to Kyushu and
Murayama in Tokyo
Nissan plans to transfer 2,500 of its workforce of 4,000 to the two plants
in summer of next year in a desperate move to stem losses.
'It's really sad,' said Ms Saiko Tsushima, a 24-year-old guide who has shown
visitors around the Zama plant for six years. Japanese companies take pride
in giving employees security. But now Ms Tsushima admits: 'I don't know
what's going to happen.'
When the plant was built Zama was largely surrounded by fields. Now the
factory lies in the middle of a dormitory town, with thousands of
white-collar commuters travelling daily to Tokyo an hour away.
The growing popularity of Zama as a residential area seems to have given
Nissan all the more reason to let go of the site. Although some of the
company's research and development laboratories and a small-scale factory
will remain in Zama, most of the 853,000-sq metre site is scheduled to be
sold.
Nissan has promised job security to all plant workers. But most are facing a
transfer similar to a move from Essex to the highlands of Scotland.
The shock is being felt in the local community. 'Nissan's plant has been the
symbol of Zama since it was built,' said Mr Kunihiko Kawasaki, a local
businessman. Indeed, the Zama plant has been the pride of the community. Mrs
Thatcher, Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and Mr Deng Xiaoping, the
Chinese leader, have all been shown the plant as a model of efficiency.
Zama city officials are worried about the expected decline in corporate tax
revenues. For the year which ended March last year, Nissan paid Y350m
(Pounds 2m) corporate taxes, some 20 per cent of Zama's corporate tax
income.
Local businesses are also deeply concerned, especially small, local parts
makers who are at the furthest reaches of Nissan's vast supply chain.
Nissan said it would start transferring its Zama workers in summer next
year. Mr Sotarou Mori, the general manager, sighs over the prospect of talks
with plant workers who face uprooting their families to keep their jobs.
But it is not the first time Mr Mori has done this kind of thing. It was
depressing, he reflected, that some of the management methods he last used
while on overseas postings for Nissan were finally coming to Japan.

WAL-MART Stores, the Arkansas-based discount retailer which grew from one
five-and-dime store to become the nation's largest store chain, yesterday
announced that sales in the year to end-January jumped by 26 per cent, to
Dollars 55.5bn.
Pre-tax profits rose at a roughly similar rate - up by 24 per cent from
Dollars 2.55bn to Dollars 3.17bn.
At the after-tax level, the 1992-3 figure was Dollars 1.99bn, compared with
Dollars 1.61bn in the previous year, and earnings per share (after a stock
split) rose from 70 cents to 87 cents.
Wal-Mart's annual results came after a strong final quarter, during which
sales increased from Dollars 13.6bn to Dollars 17.1bn, and pre-tax profits
rose from Dollars 956.2m to Dollars 1.19bn.
After-tax profits were Dollars 749.6m, against Dollars 602.4m in the same
period of the previous year.
Wal-Mart's strong sales and profits increase partly reflect the rapid
expansion of the store chain - which now encompasses 1,880 discount stores
and 256 Sam's Clubs.
A year earlier, there were 1,720 Wal-Mart Stores and 208 wholesale clubs.
However, Mr David Glass, Wal-Mart's chief executive, also noted that
'same-store' sales growth - the increase in sales from stores which have
been open for more than a year - also ran at a rate of 11 per cent for the
year overall.
Meanwhile, May Department Stores, one of the nation's largest department
store groups and also the owner of the Payless ShoeSource chain, reported
final-quarter profits of Dollars 513m before tax, up from Dollars 406m in
the same period of 1991-2.
May's sales in the three months to January 30 rose from Dollars 3.08bn to
Dollars 3.39bn, while after-tax profits increased from Dollars 266m to
Dollars 319m.
The fourth-quarter results left May posting net profits of 603m for the
year, compared with Dollars 515m.
Annual sales were up from Dollars 8.15bn to Dollars 8.68bn. The St
Louis-based company said that it was pleased with the results, given what it
described as the 'difficult economy'.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Hyundai abandons its brief
political detour - South Korea's giant has survived Chung Ju-yung's
ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Hyundai recently selected its corporate slogan for 1993, it went for
'The releap year'. The phrase signifies that South Korea's largest
conglomerate is hoping to make a fresh start after a year of turmoil.
The group's problems were caused by the political activities of Mr Chung
Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder. His unprecedented attempt to involve business
directly in politics by standing as a presidential candidate displeased the
government, which applied sanctions against Hyundai.
But Mr Chung's defeat in the December elections, and his withdrawal from
politics, has relieved the pressure on Hyundai. 'We hope that relations
between Hyundai and the government will be normalised this year,' said Mr
Park Il-kwon, Hyundai's spokesman.
Hyundai executives are now assessing the damage inflicted on the group last
year. Penalties included credit squeezes and tax penalties imposed by the
government.
Group sales among its 41 subsidiaries totalled Won42,000bn (Dollars 52.7bn),
slightly below the 1992 goal of Won44,000bn, but a 16 per cent rise from
turnover of Won36,000bn in 1991. Hyundai has set a sales target of
Won50,000bn for 1993.
Estimated earnings declined for at least half of Hyundai's 16 listed
companies. But this reflected mainly sluggish growth in the domestic economy
and weaker demand abroad - factors that also affected other Korean
conglomerates.
Although Hyundai officials last year claimed that credit sanctions were
hampering investment in such key industrial sectors as motor vehicles and
semiconductors, they now admit they exaggerated the problem to persuade the
government to be lenient.
'What last year's events revealed was the strength of the group. It had the
resources to survive,' said Mr John Wadle, an analyst with Barclay de Zoete
Wedd in Seoul.
Other observers believe that Mr Chung created as much trouble for Hyundai as
the government. 'Many of Hyundai's problems were its own fault. They had
their eye off the ball,' explained one analyst.
Mr Chung recruited Hyundai executives to work full-time for his political
party, which caused the disruption of business operations.
The problem was exacerbated during the waning days of the presidential
campaign when Hyundai employees were asked to canvass for Mr Chung. This
caused sales to drop for Hyundai companies in December. The Bank of Korea
blamed the sluggish activity at Hyundai for a fall in the nation's exports
that month.
For example, the domestic market share of Hyundai Motor, the country's
biggest vehicle manufacturer, fell to 38.6 per cent in December, as car
dealers campaigned for Mr Chung. Its market share rebounded to 54 per cent
in January.
Earnings for Hyundai Motor, the biggest industrial subsidiary in the group
with sales of Won6,080bn, consequently fell to Won40bn for the year, against
Won54bn in 1991, instead of rising as had been predicted.
The operating profit for Hyundai Motor Service, the auto sales organisation,
was also halved.
The question surrounding Hyundai is how soon business activity will return
to normal. Although Hyundai managers involved in Mr Chung's campaign
returned to the group after the election, some are in hiding for alleged
election law violations.
They include Mr Choi Soo-il, the president of Hyundai Heavy Industries, the
group's shipbuilding subsidiary, the most profitable unit with estimated
earnings of Won260bn in 1992 on sales of Won2,500bn. His absence coincides
with declining orders for the company.
'The fate of these executives will having a lingering effect on Hyundai,'
explained Mr Stephen Marvin, research director for Jardine Fleming in Seoul.
'Hyundai is an autocratic organisation, and any paralysis at the top affects
overall management. When the generals are gone, the foot soldiers don't know
what to do because mid-level management is weak.'
Hyundai officials admit that Mr Chung's defeat, the arrest of executives and
other adverse publicity about Hyundai has caused morale problems among the
group's 170,000 workers.
But they hope that spirits will rise soon as the departure of Mr Chung from
politics leads to an expected easing of official pressure on Hyundai.
The new government of President Kim Young-Sam wants to revive the flagging
economy. Further attacks on Hyundai would harm that effort since the group
plays a central role in the Korean economy.
Indeed, the government continued to provide business to Hyundai during its
clash with Mr Chung last year.
Hyundai Engineering and Construction, the group's flagship company, won the
tender for the first phase of a project to build a new international airport
in the Seoul area. The construction company, the largest in Korea, is
expected to report a 14 per cent rise in sales to Won3,200bn for 1992, while
net profits will be around Won25bn.
The possibility that the 77-year-old Mr Chung will play a less active role
in Hyundai management, together with his recent sale of shareholdings in the
group to pay for election expenses, might mollify the government.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T to take Dollars 400m stake

AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph is to buy 14.5m shares in McCaw Cellular
Communications as part of a previous agreement that will ultimately give
AT&amp;T one-third of McCaw's shares, AP-DJ reports from New York.
AT&amp;T will buy the newly-issued Class A shares of McCaw for Dollars 27.625
each, for a total of about Dollars 400m. The purchase provides an up-front
cash infusion for debt-heavy McCaw.
The investment is being made under a previous commitment exercisable by
McCaw while the two companies work toward a definitive agreement for AT&amp;T's
stake in McCaw.
Yesterday's purchase also gives AT&amp;T the right to name one director on
McCaw's board. The purchase is separate from the broad strategic alliance
the two companies announced last November.
At the time, AT&amp;T said it would buy a total of 47.6m shares at an average
price of Dollars 42 a share, for a total of about Dollars 2bn. AT&amp;T also
plans to purchase British Telecom's stake in McCaw for about Dollars 1.8bn,
bringing its total investment in McCaw to Dollars 3.8bn for the one-third
stake.
AT&amp;T and McCaw said the larger transaction was still being negotiated, and
there were no assurances that a final agreement will be reached.
Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks group, and Coca-Cola Enterprises have begun
talks on opportunities for the latter to become a bottler in international
markets.
Coca-Cola Enterprises distributes about 53 per cent of Coca-Cola's US bottle
and can volume and is 44 per cent owned by Coca-Cola.
Coca-Cola was not immediately available for comment. Coca-Cola Enterprises,
which handles the domestic bottling market, said that it was excited at the
growth potential in the international market-place.
Coca-Cola Enterprises said the chairman, Mr Donald Keough, would retire on
April 20, one day after the company's annual meeting.
Mr M. Douglas Ivester, senior vice-president of Coca-Cola, has been
nominated for election through the proxy process to Coca-Cola Enterprises'
board.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley sees 1992 income
up 7%
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
MORGAN Stanley, the New York investment bank, yesterday reported a 7 per
cent increase in net income for both the fourth quarter and 1992 as a whole.
Net income in the fourth quarter to January 31 totalled Dollars 141.8m, or
Dollars 1.68 a share, on revenues of Dollars 695.6m, compared with Dollars
132.3m, or Dollars 1.61 a share, in the quarter to the end of December 1991,
when revenues totalled Dollars 716.6m.
At a pre-tax level, income dipped from Dollars 206m to Dollars 194.8m, but
the net figure was helped by a sharply lower provision for tax (Dollars
52.9m, against Dollars 73.6m), due mainly to lower derivatives revenues from
Tokyo.
Investment banking revenues dipped from Dollars 252.3m in the 1991 quarter
to Dollars 227.9m, while trading revenues dropped from Dollars 246.3m to
Dollars 155.9m.
Revenues from investments rose from Dollars 14.3m to Dollars 33.7m, and
commissions were up from Dollars 73.9m to Dollars 81.7m. Interest and
dividends rose from Dollars 1.15bn to Dollars 1.24bn, while interest expense
was up from Dollars 1.07bn to Dollars 1.1bn.
Expenses excluding interest were held to Dollars 500.8m, down from Dollars
510.6m.
For the full year, Morgan Stanley reported net income of Dollars 510.5m, or
Dollars 5.90 a share, compared with Dollars 475.1m, or Dollars 5.93 a share,
in 1991. Net revenues were Dollars 3.02bn, as against Dollars 2.86bn.
Mr Richard Fisher, the chairman, and Mr Robert Greenhill, president, said
investment banking revenues continued to improve during 1992, with increased
debt and equity underwriting volumes offsetting weakness in financial
advisory services.
Secondary revenues - trading, commissions and net interest - declined 7 per
cent, with record results in foreign exchange offset by declines in equity
derivatives and commodities.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Japan Responds to Downturn: Nissan takes a sharp turn to
stay on the road - Emergency directors' meeting orders radical restructuring
of the company in the face of losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN HAS been shifting the bullet around its mouth since last summer.
Yesterday it finally bit it.
Early in the morning an emergency meeting of its directors agreed a radical
restructuring plan to stem the car manufacturer's mounting losses. By the
afternoon the details were echoing from factory public address systems as
managers outlined the plan to the company's 53,000-strong workforce.
As one executive put it: 'This re-structuring is deeper and more
comprehensive than any previous measures we have taken. We have cut costs
before; this time we are trying to change the company's structure.'
The plan involves the closure in 1995 of the 29-year-old Zama vehicle
assembly plant near Tokyo, a 9.4 per cent reduction in the workforce by
March 1996, and a sharp cut in the variety of models Nissan will make and
the components it uses.
The financial imperatives have become inescapable. Nissan said it expected
to make a pre-tax loss of Y29bn (Pounds 170m) in the year to the end of
March, almost double its November estimate of Y15bn. The previous year it
made a Y87bn pre-tax profit.
The reasons for an operating loss which is expected to reach Y39bn are not
hard to find. Sales will fall from 1,318,000 units last year to 1,180,000.
At the same time Nissan's costs are rising, largely to pay for its heavy
investment in the late 1980s.  Depreciation will rise from Y96.9bn in the
1990 financial year to Y160bn in 1994.
Nissan hopes the restructuring plan will return it to profit next year,
allow it to resume cash dividends in the following one, and secure a
'reasonable level of profit' in 1996.
But the plan to save Y200bn a year by the spring of 1996 is not just a
response to the sharp fall in demand from the boom years of the late 1980s.
It is designed to cope with very slow growth in the 1990s. 'Nissan is
committed to slim down its operational structure so that it will be able to
secure a reasonable level of profits even under no growth in production
volumes,' the plan says.
The ageing Zama production plant, which is in an expensive area close to
Tokyo and employs about 4,000 workers, will be closed in the spring of 1995.
Production of the Sunny model will be shifted to Kyushu, where the world's
newest car plant opened last year at a cost of Y100bn.
The Kyushu plant has been producing at an annual rate of only 423,000 cars,
well below its 600,000 capacity. The transfer from Zama will take it to full
capacity.
The other car made at Zama, the low-volume Presea, will be transferred to
the Maruyama plant which is making about 325,000 cars a year compared with a
capacity of 480,000.
Zama's workers will be transferred to other jobs. But the Nissan workforce
will be reduced by 5,000 to 48,000 by March 1996 mainly through restricting
recruitment and natural wastage. More than 3,000 people leave Nissan's
employment each year.
Most significantly, 80 per cent of the reduction will be in white collar
jobs, the first time restructuring has touched the highly protected salaried
workers. About 32,000 of Nissan's workforce are office and administrative
staff.
During the recession of the mid-1980s Nissan reduced its workforce by 6,000,
but mainly by not renewing contracts for temporary workers. Now full-time
jobs will be cut.
The number of model variations which Nissan offers will be cut by 35 per
cent in 1996, compared with June 1992, while the variety of parts will be
reduced by 40 per cent. This should produce almost half the overall cost
savings.
A string of smaller changes, including giving manufacturing staff much more
influence over how cars are designed to make sure they can be made
efficiently, are the main ingredients of a plan to increase factory floor
productivity by 10 per cent a year.
Nissan said its international operations would be fully involved in the
cost-reduction programme, which would include moves fully to integrate
international research, development and design.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Japan acts to aid recovery as top groups shed 35,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government and three of the country's top companies yesterday
separately took steps to respond to the most deep-seated economic crisis the
country has faced since the second world war.
Nissan, one of the world's top five vehicle makers, and NTT, the
telecommunications group, said they would shed 35,000 jobs between them over
the next three years.
The job cuts came at the same time as news that the board of Matsushita, the
world's largest electronics group which faces a steep fall in profits, had
forced the resignation of its president. The move shook Japan's
traditionally conservative business community where corporate changes tend
to be orderly.
The corporate shake-ups coincided with a decision by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, and other top policymakers in the ruling Liberal Democratic
party to draw up further measures to stimulate the economy.
These are likely to include bringing forward public works spending and tax
incentives for housing and capital investment, once the budget for 1993
passes through parliament next month.
The move confirms that the government believes the economy is still
deteriorating despite the Y10,700bn (Pounds 62.8bn) emergency package
announced last summer. The economic downturn has spread to embrace finance
and industry in every region.
Gross national product grew at only 1.1 per cent in the third quarter of
last year, over the same period in 1991. Machine tool orders last year fell
by 37.8 per cent and industrial production generally, fell by 6.1 per cent.
Bank lending grew by just 2 per cent in January, the same rate as in the
previous two months.
The gathering sense of gloom was reinforced by Mr Yasushi Mieno, the
governor of the Bank of Japan, who repeated his call to Japan's banks to
speed up moves to write off their mounting bad debts. Mr Mieno, in a speech
to business leaders in Tokyo, confirmed that Japan's banks face their worst
crisis since the second world war. He urged them to rapidly strengthen their
balance sheets by writing off bad debts and raising new equity to make sure
they could create the credit to finance economic recovery.
The restructuring plans unveiled by Japan's corporate sector yesterday
included:
NTT, the world's largest telecommunications group will shed 30,000 of its
workforce of more than 200,000 over the next three years and cut by a third
its 1,300 retail outlets. NTT reported a 22 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
in the half year to September.
Nissan plans to close a production plant near Tokyo by the spring of 1995
and reduce its workforce of 53,000 by 5,000 by 1996 as part of a plan to
save Y200bn. Nissan said it would make a pre-tax loss of Y29bn in the year
to the end of March.
Matsushita may introduce similar changes after its board yesterday suddenly
removed its president Mr Akio Tanii. He will be replaced by Mr Yoichi
Morishita, the vice-president. The company reported a 63 per cent fall in
pre-tax income for the nine months to the end of December.
The government's index of leading indicators for December published
yesterday suggested little hope of an early upturn. It stood at 27 per cent,
the ninth consecutive month below the 50 per cent threshold which signals
that the economy will expand.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Nobel Industries to sell defence
unit to Celsius
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S Nobel Industries is selling its defence electronics activities and
related real estate to state-owned Celsius Industries in a SKr1.55bn
(Dollars 204m) deal which starts the process of broadening the ownership
structure in Celsius.
The move came as Nobel's shares were suspended on the Stockholm and
Copenhagen bourses pending a separate announcement today.
Nobel will receive SKr325m in shares in Celsius for an approximate stake of
10 per cent, which values the whole of the defence group - 100 per cent
state-owned - at SKr3.25bn. Two weeks ago, the government lined Celsius up
as its next privatisation candidate by saying it wanted to broaden the
group's ownership structure and obtain a share listing before the summer.
Celsius is buying NobelTech Systems and NobelTech electronics for SKr755m,
and real estate amounting to SKr800m.
The purchase will give the companyan estimated 50 per cent share of the
country's defence industry. Mr Olle Lund, Celsius chairman and chief
executive, said: 'The acquisition of NobelTech further enhances our position
as one of Europe's leading defence industry groups, especially important
with respect to export markets.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Legal action threatened against Utd
Newspapers

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN &amp; Shell, publisher of Penthouse and Forum magazines, is threatening
legal action against United Newspapers, publisher of the Express and Star
national titles.
The disagreement follows a highly unusual court case last week when United
sued one of its own subsidiaries in order to break off a distribution
contract with Northern.
Northern yesterday decribed United's actions as 'a device and a sham' and
said it would issue proceedings against United later this week.
Northern and three other smaller magazine publishers signed a distribution
agreement with United Magazine Distribution, a subsidiary of United, last
summer. But relations soon turned sour and United claimed the contract was
'inoperable'.
The two sides discussed changing the contract for a couple of months.
However, United Newspapers Publications last week won a court judgment
demanding repayment of a Pounds 256,902 inter-company loan extended from UNP
to United Magazine Distributors.
Under the terms of the distribution agreement with Northern, any judgment
against UMD could lead to termination of the contract. UMD claimed the
contract was terminated on the same day the repayment judgment was made.
'We were advised by our legal side that this was the best way of ending the
contract,' United said.
Northern further alleged that UMD immediately withheld repayment of advances
previously made from Northern to UMD.

Industrial output in Austria during December fell 8.2 per cent, confirming

In November, industrial production was down 2 per cent year on year,
according to the government's statistical office.
In December, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) revised down
its forecast of economic growth for 1993 from 2 per cent to 1.3 per cent; a
WIFO official said this week that it would have to be revised downward
again, perhaps to 1 per cent.

SOME 10,000-15,000 people yesterday marched through Moscow in a protest
against Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and his government.
The rally marked Russian Armed Forces Day, which had been officially
observed by government figures putting flowers on the grave of the unknown
soldier by the Kremlin.
Mr Yeltsin was absent from the ceremony, on holiday, while Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, his rival and head of parliament, continued an official trip to
Finland.
The demonstration was led by three of the alleged ringleaders of the August
1991 coup: Mr Valentin Pavlov, the then Soviet premier; Mr Vladimir
Kryuchkov, the KGB chief; and Mr Oleg Baklanov, a senior Communist official.
The audience in the central Manezh Square heard officers denounce Mr
Yeltsin, their commander-in-chief, and demand the resignation of Gen Pavel
Grachev, the defence minister.

FT  24 FEB 93 / French Socialists try to heal rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday tried to ease
Socialist party tensions by hosting talks for senior Socialists, including
former prime minister and probable presidential candidate Mr Michel Rocard.
Mr Rocard last week called on the left to abandon socialism after next
month's parliamentary elections in favour of an alliance with the
ecologists. This call for a 'political big bang' has caused turmoil on the
left. The Socialist party, haunted by scandals and weary after a decade in
power, is heading for heavy defeat.
The Socialists will today receive yet another electoral setback with the
publication of provisional GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 1992, which
are expected to show a fall in absolute terms for the first time since the
Gulf war. Paribas, the prominent Paris bank, estimates that GDP fell 0.4 per
cent in the fourth quarter when the economy was squeezed by high interest
rates and the franc's strength.
Recent economic surveys have warned of a further deterioration, suggesting a
further fall in GDP in the first quarter of 1993. This means the hitherto
relatively resilient French economy. will be technically in recession, after
two successive quarters of economic decline.
However, the Socialists yesterday were more concerned with their internal
problems. Mr Beregovoy was clearly anxious for party leaders to present a
united front in the run-up to the polls. He arranged yesterday's lunch
gathering to finalise plans for the last phase of the campaign. It was
attended by Mr Laurent Fabius, Socialist first secretary, Mr Jean Arnoux,
the party's parliamentary leader, by Mr Rocard and Mr Jacques Delors,
European Commission president.
Mr Arnoux said the Socialists were in 'perfect harmony' and described Mr
Rocard's 'big bang' as a chance to expand 'the socialist universe'. Mr
Rocard and Mr Delors told reporters they had an 'excellent' lunch 'between
friends'.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The early strength in the derivatives sector faded as talk of a big rights
issue returned to dominate trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the favourable overnight performance on Wall Street and firmness
in the some of the European markets led to a strong opening in the March
contract on the FT-SE. It started trading at 2,859, some 17 points above
Monday's close.
But with no follow through buying, the early strength in March faded and the
contract went into reverse mid-morning as talk of a big rights issue
gathered strength.
Increased selling of March led to its continued decline in the afternoon and
the contract reached the day's low of 2,810 at 3.15pm. Bargain hunters then
moved in and the contract finished at 2,818, down 24 on its previous close
and at a 6 point discount to the underlying cash market. Turnover at 12,568
was good.
The volume in the traded options improved on Monday's meagre levels reaching
33,045 lots by the close. Around 5,610 lots were dealt in the FT-SE100 index
option, and the Euro FT-SE index saw business of 1,852 lots.
Among the stock options, the expiry of the February options today in BTR led
to active business in its stock option and it traded 4,727 lots. It was

FT  24 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Fears of rights issues return in
force
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP turnround in share prices left the UK market looking weak in late
dealings yesterday, when hints that a big rights issue was pending drove
investors to the sidelines. The blue chip sectors were badly hit, with oil
stocks encouraged by higher crude prices providing the only firm exception.
The FT-SE 100 Index ran through most of what appears to have become its
latest trading range, touching 2,852.5 in the morning and closing at 2,818,
down a net 20.3 on the day. Traders will watch nervously this morning to see
if the Footsie challenges the lower end of the range.
Equities opened firmly, taking aboard disappointing news on bad debt
provisions from National Westminster Banking without too much discomfort.
But the 14.2 gain on the Footsie was abruptly reversed when the March future
contract on the FT-SE turned down sharply. The slide continued throughout
the session, gathering pace towards the close when the rights issue rumours
circulated.
Although Seaq trading volume increased to 597.8m shares from Monday's
553.2m, or Pounds 1.18bn in retail worth, selling pressure was not heavy
yesterday. Investment attention turned back to the FT-SE listed stocks, and
the percentage of non-Footsie business of total volume dipped to around 61
per cent.
'The market seems to lack clear direction at the moment,' commented Mr Nigel
Little of Panmure Gordon. Activity was highly stock selective yesterday,
with several blue chip names moving erratically. UK equities appear likely
to remain unsettled until impending rights issues are out of the way.
ICI was still considered the most likely candidate for a rights issue,
perhaps ahead of Thursday's important announcement of trading results and
the company's demerger plan. But some older favourites were suggested,
including Glaxo and General Accident.
The pharmaceutical sector remained unsettled in London as investors saw drug
stocks under pressure across Europe from uncertainty over the industry's US
prospects under the Clinton Administration. However, profits from SmithKline
Beecham were in line with market expectations and the shares responded
calmly to the announcement.
The banking sector reacted badly to a further, albeit modest, increase in
bad debt provisions at National Westminster, which contrasted with some of
the more optimistic views expressed by sector analysts this week. The
Footsie was also hit by a hefty fall in BAT Industries, in part because of
Philip Morris stock had fallen in New York.
The general weakness cut into share prices across the consumer and retail
sectors, although expectations of a cut in UK interest rates in next month's
Budget speech remained high.
With Wall Street only 5 Dow points off in UK hours, the London market made
little response to the disappointing fall in the latest US consumer
confidence index. Oil shares responded strongly after Brent crude prices
rose through a resistance barrier, and there were signs that UK funds, which
have been anti-BP since the dividend was cut last year, might be changing
stance on the shares in the blue chip oil group.

FT  24 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: NatWest hurt by write-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS widespread disappointment in the market with preliminary results
from National Westminster Bank, although traders commented that the shares
had merely given up the previous day's gains. They also pointed to the
share's 35 per cent relative outperformance over the past year.
The bank's pre-tax profits, at Pounds 405m, were in the middle of the market
range, but dealers expressed concern at the continuing high level of bad
debts which led the bank to write off Pounds 1.9bn, compared with the
previous year's figure of Pounds 1.87bn.
NatWest shares opened lower at 452p after the results were known and then
embarked on a gradual decline which saw them down to 437p in mid-session as
analysts assessed current year forecasts in the light of the cautious
statement accompanying the figures. At the close the shares were trading 16
lower at 443p, a fall of 3.5 per cent. Turnover totalled 15m shares.
One analyst said there remained a question mark over the group's capital
base and that an injection of funds would be required at some point,
although not in the short term. Another said: 'There was nothing in the
bank's figures nor in the post-results meeting with analysts to suggest
there are any hidden goodies.' Barclays Bank shares fell 4.9 per cent, or 21
1/2 to 427 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 8m. Barclays reports preliminary
numbers on March 4.
BAT weaken
Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries suffered in the wake of worries
of increased US taxes as well as some takeover speculation. The shares were
weak all day and came off sharply when the US market opened to end the day
33 lower at 926p on heavy turnover of 8.4m shares.
Concern that Mrs Hillary Clinton would raise cigarette taxes as part of her
health reforms surfaced on Monday and sent the price of Philip Morris shares
spiralling downward in the US. BAT, makes about a third of its profits from
US tobacco sales and a similar amount from insurance, most of which has
recently been US generated. There was also nervousness that a tax could be
imposed on US insurance premiums. Finally there was talk, generally greeted
with scepticism, that BAT might make a bid for high street bank TSB.
Guinness down
Several adverse factors combined to hit Guinness, causing the shares to
retreat 12 to 456p. The chief factor was continuing worry that LVMH,
cross-holding partner of the UK drinks group, may be considering a corproate
restructure so as to raise cash for a bid in the French media industry. But
speculation that LVMH could look to Guinness to increase its existing 24 per
cent stake would be at odds with the latter's stated strategy as well as
breaching the agreement between the two.
Other negative influences yesterday included a bearish report on prospects
for increases in US excise taxes, and sluggish whisky sales in Japan. LVMH
was also said to be reducing champagne prices by some 10 per cent, and there
was also talk of a downgrade on the group in Paris by James Capel. In
London, BZW shaved its forecast for Guinness.
Drugs stance
A perception that the heavy US selling of pharmaceuticals is drying up
prompted Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull to adopt a more positive stance
on the sector.
Strauss, a significant player in American Depositary Receipts, moved its
recommendation to 'neutral' from 'underweight' and said it was not far off
becoming a buyer. Mr Paul Diggle, pharmaceutical analyst and Strauss's head
of research said: 'I don't think everything Mrs Clinton can do to the sector
is fully reflected in the price, but I can't believe there is much downside
to go.'
Glaxo rose 4 against the market to 653p and SmithKline Beecham, which
announced well-received full-year results, lifted 3 to 424p in the 'A's and
2 1/2 to 367p in the Units. The company announced a profit of Pounds 1.115bn
and a 15 per cent sales growth. However, Wellcome suffered as a result of an
overhang of stock and the realisation that the group's rating has not fallen
in line with its rivals. The shares dropped 29 to 881p.
BPB setback
A Pounds 64m convertible bond issue due in 2008, accompanied by a forecast
that the 1992 dividend total will be cut from last year's 11.25p to 7.5p,
undermined sentiment in BPB shares. They retreated 17 to 217p, having
dropped to 214 1/2 p at one point. The fall took place in exceptionally
heavy trading during which 12m BPB shares changed hands. Specialists were
perplexed at the extent of the shares' decline, pointing out that most
analysts had already forecast a cut in the dividend payout.
Final results from Unilever came within market forecasts but a raised
dividend helped bolster the shares which rose 16 to 1160p. Mr David Hallam
at Williams de Broe said a good performance in most markets was being
threatened by the weakness in the German economy and he remained a
short-term holder. Most analysts, however, were positive on a longer term
view.
Worries by one broker over margin pressures at Boots the chemist knocked the
shares, off 9 at 484p. Sears suffered from a badly handled order and lost 4
to 97p.
Rumours of a big rights issue in the leisure sector found few credible
candidates, although some fingered Granada, the group, which has been busily
presenting itself to the institutions in recent weeks. The shares added 4 to
392p.
Despite an upbeat message at the agm, shares in Grand Metropolitan fell
back, closing 6 off at 445p. Dealers said the stock, along with selected
other drinks shares, was suffering a hangover from Monday's big programme
trade. Bass slipped 7 to 583p, and Whitbread A shares 6 to 449p.
Much better interim profits than expected from Amstrad, the consumer
electronics group, and an unexpected interim dividend, saw the shares race
up 4 to 29p. Turnover reached 10m, the heaviest single-day's business since
last July, when the company first warned of big losses.
At best, analysts had expected Amstrad to break even during the period with
some looking for losses of up to Pounds 20m, compared with Pounds 15.2m
losses at the same stage last year. For the full year Amstrad posted losses
of Pounds 71m.
A sizeable profits downgrading for business services group BET led to heavy
selling and a sharp fall for the shares.
Hoare Govett maintained its forecast for the year to March 1993 at Pounds
70m but cut the following year's estimate by nearly 20 per cent to Pounds
81m, to take account of restructuring costs.
The move led to strong selling of the stock and by the close the shares were
down 8 1/2 to 88 1/2 p, following trade of 7.8m. Hoare Govett warned that
BET may be forced to reduce its dividend by 2p to 4.5p. James Capel reduced
its dividend expectation from 6.5p to 4p.
Elsewhere in the sector, Vinten Group continued to be boosted by the recent
recommendation by NatWest Securities and put on another 3 to 357p.
Fears that the dispute between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic could
worsen continued to hurt the shares of the UK flag carrier.
They closed 4 down at 280p, having touched 277p, in trade of 4.4m, with
speculation circulating of a possible rights issue.
The announcement by Glasgow-based engineering company Howden Group of a
two-for-seven rights issue at 52p to raise Pounds 31.4m, saw the shares ease
4 to 59p.
Leather and hosiery group Hartsone was hit by a spate of stories including a
profit forecast downgrade by the broker and management changes. The shares,
down 15 at one stage, recovered to close 2 off at 270p.

FT  24 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Cyclical spree sends US
prices into spiral

Wall Street
AN AFTERNNON spree in cyclical issues sent stock prices spiralling in spite
of a recovery in the healthcare sector, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 19.73 to 3,323.26 after adding more
than 5 points in morning trading. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's
500 was 0.45 lower at 434.79, while the Amex composite added 0.67 to 399.96
and the Nasdaq composite eased 0.86 to 651.56. Trading volume on the New
York SE was heavy with more than 323m shares changing hands on the day, and
rises outnumbered declines by 1053 to 909.
On Monday, the Dow climbed 20.81 to 3,342.99. The stock market lost ground
on a day when the treasury's bellwether 30-year bond soared 1 3/8 for a
yield of 6.824 per cent.
Eroding prices for cyclical stocks contributed to Wall Street's afternoon
retreat. In the auto sector, Chrysler dropped Dollars 2- 1/8 to Dollars 35-
7/8 , Ford lost Dollars 1- 7/8 at Dollars 44- 7/8 and General Motors slumped
Dollars 1- 3/4 to Dollars 36- 7/8 .
Pharmaceutical stocks, which have slumped on fears that President Clinton's
healthcare reforms will cut into profit growth, regained some of their
recent losses yesterday. Merck was Dollars 1 higher at Dollars 37- 5/8 ,
Bristol-Myers Squibb rose Dollars 2- 3/4 to Dollars 56 5/8 , Pfizer grew
Dollars 3 to Dollars 57 and Johnson &amp; Johnson firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars
40.
Mylan Laboratories, which plunged Dollars 4- 5/8 on Monday, was quoted
Dollars 3- 3/4 higher at Dollars 29- 1/8 . The pharmaceutical products
company said it expects to turn in record revenues and earnings for its
fiscal year ending in March.
Among featured issues, Dean Witter Discover was quoted at Dollars 31 in
heavy trading. The initial public offering of 29.5m shares in the financial
services company was priced at Dollars 27 late Monday. Sears, parent of Dean
Witter, Discover had expected a price of Dollars 23 to Dollars 25.
Shares in tobacco giant Philip Morris continued to sink, reflecting investor
worries that the Clinton administration might impose an excise tax on
cigarettes to help fund reform of the healthcare system. The stock fell
Dollars -7/8 to Dollars 63-5/8. An analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham was
reported to have removed Philip Morris from his recommended list.
Other tobacco stocks also lost ground including RJR Nabisco, off Dollars
 1/4 at Dollars 7-3/4 and UST, down Dollars -3/8 to Dollars 25-7/8.
Oil stocks, which led Monday's rally, were mixed yesterday in spite of
further gains in crude oil futures. Chevron slid Dollars 1-1/8 to Dollars
78, Mobil added Dollars -1/2 to Dollars 67-3/8, Texaco lost Dollars 1-1/8 to
Dollars 62-1/8 and British Petroleum's ADRs edged Dollars -1/8 lower to
Dollars 48-3/8.
Canada
TORONTO share prices closed slightly higher in active trading, boosted by a
strong increase in gold stocks.
According to preliminary data, the 300 composite index gained 5.11 points,
or 0.15 per cent, to 3,452.78. Advances led declines 351 to 312.
Volume rose to 40.64m shares from 39.80m shares on Monday, and trading value
was CDollars 409.4m, up from CDollars 397m.
The banking sector was up 0.50 per cent as Salomon Brothers Inc. raised its
investment ratings on Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia and
Canadian Imperial Bank to 'buy' from 'hold.'
Air Canada said it will ask all employees to accept a 5 per cent salary cut
as of April 1.

FT  24 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Budget hopes take
Singapore to record high

<TEXT>
VOLATILITY in the currency markets, ahead of the Group of Seven finance
ministers meeting this weekend, gave investors an excuse to remain inactive
and prices gained marginal ground after moving within a tight range, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index closed up 42.54 at 16,863.15 after moving between 16,925.15
and 16,794.12, fluctuating on index-linked trading. Volume fell from 215m to
200m shares; declines led advances by 567 to 344 with 205 unchanged; the
Topix index of all first section stocks fell 2.60 to 1,281.31 and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell by 0.80 to 1,204.25.
Trading remained dull as most investors focused on yen-dollar currency
movements. The yen closed up Y0.07 at Y116.78 after hitting an all-time best
of Y115.90-94 in New York. While the yen's rise in Tokyo was checked by
financial authorities hinting at possible intervention, traders said that
investors will remain on the sidelines ahead of Saturday's G7 meeting in
London.
Dealers were also quiet as yesterday was the last trading day for February
settlements. Meanwhile, a plunge in the balance of margin stock buying
reflected weak sentiment among individual investors. The Tokyo Stock
Exchange said that margin buying fell to a 10-year low as positions bought
on margin were liquidated ahead of margin settlements in March.
The oil sector was the main loser, dragged down by Showa Shell Sekiyu. The
affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell plunged by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,000
on concerns over its foreign exchange losses, announced over the weekend.
Other oil stocks were also weak with Nippon Oil down Y3 to Y590 and
Mitsubishi Oil down Y26 to Y859.
Exporters continued to weaken on the higher yen. Hitachi fell Y5 to Y671 and
Toshiba retreated Y4 to Y556. Toyota Motor lost Y10 to Y1,330. However, gas
utilities, which depend on imports, were firm, with Tokyo Gas up Y5 to Y411
and Osaka Gas advancing Y5 to Y427.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y6,000 to Y613,000 on reports that it
would cut 30,000 employees by encouraging early retirement and transfers to
affiliates.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 157.28 to 18,136.01 in 79.8m shares.
Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y180 to Y9,920 on fears of lower
profits due to the higher yen.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets took their lead from domestic developments and turned in
mixed performances.
SINGAPORE built up its hopes that Friday's budget would prove positive for
business and investors alike and shares gathered momentum to close at a
record high.
The Straits Times Industrial index rose 21.45, or 1.3 per cent, to 1,661.32
in volume that swelled to 175.8m shares. The mood was also buoyed by
expectations of strong fourth quarter domestic product growth data, due
today.
HONG KONG moved in the opposite direction, profit-taking leaving the Hang
Seng index 82.69, or 1.3 per cent, lower at 6,149.19 in turnover of
HKDollars 2.82bn.
The heavily oversubscribed Denway Investment lost 15 cents to HKDollars 2.05
on its second day of trading.
AUSTRALIA saw the All Ordinaries index close 3.3 higher at 1,608.3 in
turnover of ADollars 319m. Trade was boosted by Pancontinental Mining, 4
cents higher at 99 cents, after French group Cogema sold its 10 per cent
stake in the miner for ADollars 24.4m. On Monday, Degussa, the German
chemical group, sold its 10 per cent stake for ADollars 21.1m.
TAIWAN spent a volatile session with heavy profit-taking in the last
half-hour erasing early gains. The weighted index, which briefly broke above
4,200 points at mid-morning, ended 26.95 down at 4,071.49.
Parliamentary confirmation of Lien Chan as the next premier came shortly
after the market closed.
BANGKOK saw rumours resurface that the market could face further official
investigations into share price manipulation. The SET index ended 0.46
higher at 946.08.

FT  24 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Chemicals join drugs on
downgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decline in pharm-aceuticals continued yesterday, joined by caution about
the imminent chemical companies reporting season, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw a drop of 19.16 in the DAX index as turnover rose from DM5.4bn
to DM5.8bn. The biggest falls were in Mannesmann, and the big three
chemicals as the results season approached. Mannesmann said that 1992
profits would be sharply down on 1991, and the shares fell DM7.70 to DM247
after a string of downgrades from analysts.
Bayer had the worst fall among chemicals, DM7.80 to DM273.80, with Hoechst
DM5.40 lower at DM264.90 and BASF down DM5.30 at DM228.70. For European
chemicals as a group, Goldman Sachs expected a generally poor 1992 final
quarter and warnings over prospects for 1993.
The brokers expected dividend cuts from BASF and Hoechst: 'Bayer has no
financial reason to cut', they wrote, 'but may feel the need to make a
gesture for socio-political reasons.' One of the team, Mr Mark Tracey, added
that stocks with drugs exposure were catching a cold from the Clinton
reforms and their consequences in the US market.
STOCKHOLM saw further heavy US selling of Astra which left the B shares down
another SKr20 on the day at SKr655 for a fall of 5.7 per cent since the
group announced its 1992 results on Monday.
Mr David Longmuir of James Capel said that Astra was likely to remain
volatile over the next few days. US investors, he said, were concerned at
the effect President Bill Clinton's proposals to regulate healthcare
pricing, due to be announced in May, would have on the sector. The
Affarsvarlden general index lost 8.1 to 987.9 with turnover in Astra
accounting for some SKr425m of the SKr1.1bn total.
Handelsbanken clawed back some of an early fall on a heavy 1992 loss, the B
shares closing SKr2.50 lower at SKr45.50 after a day's low of SKr41.00. Loan
losses of 2.8 per cent of total lending compared well with an average of
some 6 per cent for the sector as a whole.
PARIS eased on a rise in short term interest rates, triggered by a weaker
franc, and sporadic profit-taking. The CAC-40 index declined 15.10 to
1,944.13, after a high of 1,966 and a low of 1,938, as turnover remained
resilient at FFr2. bn.
LVMH was downgraded by brokers James Capel after announcing that it had cut
the retail price of some of its champagne labels in France, Switzerland and
Germany.
Mr Louic Morvan of Capel, in Paris, said that he had lowered his EPS
estimates from FFr212.50 to FFr203.00 for 1993, and from FFr239.20 to
FFr229.60 for 1994. The shares dipped FFr86 to FFr3,265. He added that the
change in pricing policy was an attempt to maintain market share and to
counter imports, particularly of Italian sparkling wines, which benefited
from devaluation.
ZURICH continued to be undermined by sales of pharmaceutical stocks as
domestic investors took a lead from their US counterparts, and the SMI index
shed 45.4. or 2.1 per cent to 2,050.4.
Sandoz was among the hardest hit, falling SFr150 or 5 per cent to SFr2,990.
Roche shed SFr180 to SFr3,830 while Ciba-Geigy was SFr18 lower at SFr628.
Banks and insurers also declined in spite of further reductions in domestic
interest rates. Union Bank fell SFr7 to SFr936, CS Holding dipped SFr20 to
SFr2,140 and Zurich Insurance declined SFr30 to SFr2,200.
MILAN was again overshadowed by political worries but an unexpected rebound
by Fiat, as investors shrugged off Monday's arrest of two executives, helped
the market ahead. The Comit index rose 1.02 to 502.94.
The decision by the prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, to call a confidence
vote later in the week did little to assuage the uncertainty which has left
the lira sinking against the D-mark.
Fiat dominated trading with domestic buyers turning out in force. The shares
fixed L45 lower at L5,305 but then bounced back to L5,440 in late business.
MADRID's equities followed Monday's slide in Spanish bonds, as pressure
mounted against the peseta. The Bank of Spain's decision to leave its
benchmark interest rate untouched at 13.00 per cent at a securities
repurchase tender early in the day failed to reassure investors, and the
general index closed 4.46, or 1.9 per cent lower at 227.92.
AMSTERDAM was flat on the day with the CBS Tendency index at 100.1, but
Philips closed off 90 cents at Fl 22.60 after the group said that it was to
consolidate Grundig, the German electronics company, in its 1992 accounts.
Unilever advanced Fl 3.10 to Fl 199.40 after its 1992 results were well
received.
COPENHAGEN saw a fall in the biotechnology group, Novo, and higher domestic
money market rates. The KFX index lost 0.87 to 83.38.
Novo fell DKr16 to DKr580, in line with the lower trend in European
pharmaceutical issues.

FT  24 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Pre-budget blues vanish in Bombay
equity rally - But political worries remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By R. C. MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Each February, pre-budget blues grip Indian equity markets as investors fret
over possible increases in excise duties and taxes. Share prices tend to
drift in a narrow range and trading contracts as traders refrain from
committing themselves.
However, this year, things are different - and anything but dull. The month
started with shares rising sharply in the hope that the budget for the
fiscal year from April 1 will boost the market, rather than deflate it.
Far from worrying about possible tax increases, traders talked excitedly of
tax cuts, and growth-promoting measures. The violence, and the political
crisis following the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque almost slipped from
investors' minds.
But in the past two weeks, politics has come back to the fore, putting
equities into some confusion with a fall, and a subsequent recovery. The
mood now is finely balanced between worries about politics - including the
stability of the government at New Delhi. There are also hopes that, after
two years of stagnation, the economy is set for sustained growth.
Speculation has intensified on stock exchange floors about the tax cuts and
incentives which the PV Narasimha Rao administration plans to introduce in
the budget to be presented on February 27. Import tariffs are expected to be
cut on a wide front and the finance minister has before him an expert
committee suggestion that corporate tax should be lowered to 30 per cent,
from 42.5 per cent at present.
Fertiliser shares and scrips of a dozen export-oriented companies led the
rally earlier this month on the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest,
accounting for two-thirds of national trading. The BSE 30-share index jumped
by more than 160 points to a three-month peak of 2,812.
The market had been subdued for the previous six months, as a parliamentary
committee probed the Rs35bn securities scandal involving Mr Harshad Mehta,
the ultra-bullish broker who helped to lift share values to an all-time peak
of 4,500 last April.
In the recent short bull run, Zuari Agrochemicals jumped by 10 per cent
while Gujarat State Fertilisers and Gujarat Narmada Fertilisers were up by 8
per cent on reports of budget incentives to boost fertiliser production.
Bombay Dyeing and the Birla-owned Century Textiles posted a 7 per cent
increase. Textiles, and other exporting companies wallowed on expectations
of the rupee being made fully convertible for trade transactions.
The Indian currency has shown weakness against the US dollar on foreign
exchange markets recently, and a switch from the present dual exchange rate,
if announced in the budget, would give a bonanza to exporters.
But the market was jolted and the rally aborted some two weeks ago by three
major political events.
First, the Bharatiya Janata party, which was responsible for the destruction
of Babri Mosque at Ayodhya in December, expressed its determination to press
ahead with a banned meeting in New Delhi tomorrow, triggering apprehension
about renewed violence.
Secondly, demands for the removal of the chief minister of Maharashtra
province, Mr SA Naik, a protege of Mr Narasimha Rao, have been intensified.
And, finally, relations between Congress and the local party which rules the
southern state of Tamil Nadu, whose support is vital for the survival of the
prime minister, have soured.
Share prices tumbled 140 points early this week but recovered some ground on
Wednesday as the political situation thawed. 'The (stock) market is poised
for a rise,' says Mr MR Mayya, BSE executive director. 'It all depends on
political developments.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar hit by poor indicators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US DOLLAR lost around 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark in European
trading yesterday after a fall in the latest US consumer confidence data
raised fears that the scale of the US economic upturn could not be
sustained, writes James Blitz.
A widely followed measure of consumer confidence, issued by the Conferebnce
Board, dropped to 68.5 in February from 76.7 in January, when the market had
been expecting a reading in the high 70s.
The dollar fell to a low of DM1.6110 on the news and later closed in London
at DM1.6125 from a previous DM1.6285.
Yesterday's data added to the growing feeling in currency markets that the
dollar's recent rise to DM1.67 has petered out.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist of DKB International in London, said that
yesterday's indicators underlined the recent gloom in another poll by the
ABC/Money index, which showed consumer confidence remaining very subdued in
the aftermath of Mr Bill Clinton's election as US President.
'The strength of the US recovery in the fourth quarter of last year may not
be maintained,' he said.
Analysts at Citibank were also cautious about whether the dollar could break
higher against the D-Mark. 'Signs of a future moderation in activity would
obviously raise pressure for another cut in official rates, especially given
the budget deficit reduction,' the bank's currency strategists said in their
latest report.
The dollar's weakness against the D-Mark was a source of renewed tension
inside the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday.
The German currency's stronger performance against the peseta and krone
forced the Spanish and Danish authorities to raise interest rates to
preserve their currencies' strength.
At the close of European trading, the peseta was a little stronger against
the D-Mark at Pta72.58. But the krone fell as low as DKr3.8560 to the
D-Mark, closer to its ERM floor of DKr3.9016.
Mr Mark Austin, Treasury economist at Midland Global Markets in London, said
that the recent weakness of the Spanish and Italian currencies was taking
its toll on the French franc in the ERM.
In his view, the fall in the value of the lira and peseta could exacerbate
problems for French exporters. Any threat of Spain quitting the ERM could
also undermine the franc. The French currency closed at FFr3.396 to the
D-Mark from a previous FFr3.392.
As ERM tensions grow, it may be that the strength of the D-Mark dominates
this weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven's finance ministers rather than
the strength of the yen.
Yesterday, the Japanese currency hovered around its record-breaking postion
against the dollar, closing at Y116.65 from a previous Y116.35.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Money Markets: More ERM pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY MARKET interest rates in both Spain and Denmark rose sharply yesterday
as both the peseta and the Danish krone came under renewed pressures inside
the European exchange rate mechanism, writes James Blitz.
The creakiness of the ERM continues to be the dominant theme in interest
rate markets, despite recent easing in German monetary policy.
Yesterday the Spanish authorities were forced to nudge 1 month interest
rates up to 20 per cent, as the peseta slipped to around Pta73.00 against
the D-Mark.
Later in the day, the Bank of Spain hiked its intervention rate by 71 basis
points to 15.32 per cent.
One month Danish krone were also quoted as high as 23 per cent, as the
currency fell below DKr3.85 to the D-Mark in late European trading.
One London-based dealer said this augured badly for the Danish authorities,
since they had only just cut the discount rate by 100 basis points to 10.5
per cent.
The problem for the authorities in both countries is that a policy of
raising interest rates to support the currency carries little political
credibility.
In Spain, unemployment is hovering around 20 per cent, and the government
faces a general election in October. In Denmark, the chances of the country
voting Yes in its second referendum in Maastricht next month may also be
damaged by the punishingly high level of interest rates.
In France and Germany, dealers continued to scale down hopes for lower
rates. The March Euromark contract yesterday closed down 8 basis points at
91.87.
Dealers are now assuming that 3-month money will be at 8.13 per cent by the
middle of next month, only 17 basis points below yesterday's level.
Two Bundesbank money market interventions and a council meeting are due over
the next two weeks. Many dealers think that an easing in rates is possible
over this period.
However, the March French franc contract closed down 19 basis points, at
88.30, on expectations that pressure on the currency will remain intense
until after next month's parliamentary elections in France. One month French
interest rates were up at 12 1/8 per cent yesterday from 11 7/8 per cent the
day before.
Sterling markets were quiet. Three-month sterling cash closed a little
softer at 6 1/8 per cent following the small shortage of Pounds 1bn forecast
by the Bank of England.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian nickel output to
remain low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL NICKEL Indonesia (PT Inco), one of the world's major nickel
producers, will operate significantly below its installed capacity in 1993
for the fourth year running, the company admitted yesterday.
Mr Thomas Sitepu, the company's vice president, said that the second of
three furnaces at its Sulawesi plant was being overhauled and would be
closed until mid-year.
He said production this year would be marginally higher than 1992's total of
80.1m lb (36,350 tonnes) of nickel in matte but below the plant's nameplate
capacity of 100m lb. Industry officials forecast PT Inco's 1993 production
at about 83m lb.
Mr Sitepu said the company would operate at full capacity in 1994 but warned
the third furnace would need overhauling in 1995, again limiting output.
PT Inco, with its own hydroelectric power plant, remains one of the world's
cheapest nickel producers, able to break even at a price of Dollars 2.45 a
lb. Nickel prices last year averaged Dollars 3.38 a lb and the company made
a Dollars 36.1m net profit, down from Dollars 57m in 1991.
'We run the company well but if the nickel price drops, what can I do?' said
Mr Sitepu, who painted a grim picture of the world nickel industry.
He forecast that world supply - including exports from Commonwealth of
Independent States, China and former Comecon countries - would drop by less
than 100m lb from last year's 1.5bn lb. With the nickel price languishing at
about Dollars 2.81 a lb, the closure of higher cost mines would continue, he
suggested.
World demand (excluding the CIS, China and former Comecon countries)
totalled 1.4bn lb last year, down from 1.525 lb in 1991, while stocks of
more than 180m lb in London Metal Exchange registered warehouses were 'very
high', he said. Cuts in defence spending would continue to hurt the industry
as weapons manufacturers were big consumers of nickel.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ fish exports thrive in the
cold - Sales were up last year in both value and volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the worst weather for decades, New Zealand's fish exports
thrived last year. The Fishing Industry Board published figures this month
showing that in the year to December 31, earnings surged 26.7 per cent to a
record NZDollars 1.2bn (Pounds 430m).
The optimism raised by the growing importance of New Zealand fish exports
has been dampened in recent weeks, however, by the nationwide ban on the
taking of shellfish imposed because of the appearance of an as yet
unidentified strain of algal bloom.
For the first time New Zealanders have been brought face to face with the
vulnerability of the fishing industry: until the present outbreak algal
infections were unknown, and the country prided itself on its clean coastal
waters. While the algae affect only shellfish the fishing industry is
concerned that overseas buyers may be put off New Zealand fish in general.
This month's figures show the vibrant state of the industry, which is a
growing employer with thousands now engaged in processing fish for export.
Export earnings rose month by month, even in the harsh stormy winter months
when bitterly cold temperatures reduced fish numbers and kept boats in port.
Fishing Industry Board figures for the year to December 31 show that the
exports of fin fish totalled 204.6m tonnes, a 5 per cent rise from 1991. And
the fob value rose 28.5 per cent to NZDollars 855.28m from 1991's NZDollars
665.82m. Earnings for rock lobster, much of which is exported live to Japan
and the US, slipped in the last quarter, however, because of recessionary
trends and lower catches. The total amount exported of live, whole, and
processed rock lobster, known as crayfish in New Zealand, fell 1.5 per cent
to 2,792 tonnes; and its value was down 0.4 per cent at NZDollars
101,441,462.
There was a remarkable boom in squid catching: helped by weather conditions
that were harsh on other species. Cold weather and strong currents from
Australia apparently boosted the amount of nutrients in the water, to the
squid's advantage. The squid catch for the year to December was up 59 per
cent to 44,696 tonnes, which fetched 44.3 per cent more at NZDollars 80.14m.
The economic loss caused by the temporary closure of the mussel industry is
shown by the increasing production of recent years. In the year to December
31 the value of mussel exports rose 26.3 per cent to NZDollars 48.5m on a
22.2 per cent increase in tonnage produced. New production of scallops led
to a 33.7 per cent increase in value to NZDollars 20m. But this was on a
production increase of 66.8 per cent to 1,000 tonnes. The new production,
mainly from Golden Bay, at the tip of the South Island, has led to a halving
in prices to about NZDollars 20 a kilogram.
While the remarkably cold water temperatures encouraged the squid, other
varieties were far less enthusiastic, especially the important white fish
variety hoki, which is now exported in large quantities to Britain, Europe
and the US.
In the peak fishing month of August only 5.94m tonnes were landed, compared
with 13.1m tonnes in the same month in 1991. However hoki exports earned
32.1 per cent more last year, at NZDollars 423m, thanks to a 20 per cent
increase in the amount sold in frozen filleted form.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian production forecast
to grow more slowly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NORWAY WILL set another record for crude oil and natural gas liquids
production this year but growth will be much slower than that achieved in
1992, according to a report by Edinburgh-based analyst Wood Mackenzie.
WoodMac forecasts that oil/ngl production will increase by about 3 per cent
to a daily average of 2.28m barrels, following a 14 per cent surge in 1992
to a daily average of 2.22m barrels.
The analyst predicts that production in the fourth quarter of this year will
soar to about 2.5m barrels a day as five new fields are brought on stream.
Last year the Norwegian share of total North Sea crude oil production
reached 53 per cent, making it western Europe's biggest oil producer for the
second year in a row, following 11 consecutive years of growth.
Total North Sea output will rise to an all-time high of 4.38m b/d this year,
the analyst forecasts, from 4.22m b/d in 1992.
WoodMac says the net effect of bad weather in January and February, which
hindered oil tanker loading operations, deferred production of about 7m
barrels of oil from Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Snorre fields.
It forecasts that Norwegian production will advance to 2.39m b/d in April
and retreat to an expected low of 2.06 b/d in June when scheduled
maintenance work is under way. Maintenance shutdowns are likely to defer
production of about 19m barrels of oil/ngl, compared with 26m barrels in
1992.
WoodMac says a notable feature of 1993 will be a 50 per cent increase by the
end of the year in Norway's ngl/condensate production, which will hit a
record 150,000 b/d, when the Sleipner East, Loeke and Lille Frigg fields
come on stream.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: British farm land cheaper since
devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK AGRICULTURAL land prices are proving increasingly attractive to European
buyers since the country left the ERM, according to Savills, the UK property
consultants.
Values have retreated by 15 per cent since September as far as foreign
buyers are concerned. In sterling terms, prices are about a third below the
peak of 1988-89.
In its second annual European land report, Savills estimates that average
high quality arable land in England and Wales is worth Pounds 2,000 an acre,
compared with Pounds 2,700 an acre last year. This put them level pegging
with France, where similar land last year was worth Pounds 1,400 an acre.
French land has traditionally been cheaper than English, as there are 2.4
acres per head of population in France compared with 1 acre in the UK.
Austrian land of similar quality is the most expensive in Savills' survey at
Pounds 7,800 an acre, while Spanish is at the bottom of the scale at Pounds
1,000.
Mr Justin Marking, director of Savills Europe, said yesterday that because
of economic recession, European prices were no longer distorted by
non-agricultural buyers. He estimated that European inquiries for UK farm
land had risen this year by between 15 and 20 per cent.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices reach 3-month highs
in Opec 'honeymoon'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD OIL prices broke through Dollars 19 a barrel yesterday for the first
time since November following an increase in price of Dollars 1 a barrel
over the past two days.
The price of North Sea Brent crude for April delivery closed up 35 cents
yesterday at Dollars 18.95 a barrel - after earlier rising above Dollars 19
 -as the market enjoyed a honeymoon period after last week's agreement by
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to slash output to 23.58m
barrels a day from 25m in January.
Traders at major oil companies say they have been told by Saudi Arabia and
Abu Dhabi that they will be cutting sales of oil from March, but have yet to
see any concrete evidence that other members are prepared to cut back.
The market is waiting to see if Kuwait, Iran and Nigeria will be cutting
back on deliveries. 'People will have to be turned away from the door - if
that happens it will be extremely bullish for oil prices,' said one oil
company trader.
But without proof that other countries are beginning to trim their output,
oil prices could collapse. Kuwait has already warned that it will respond if
other members cheat on their production allocations. The emirate was
squeezed very hard by other countries to trim production to 1.6m b/d.
Demand will not come to the rescue as it remains patchy and weak - US
consumption in January was flat and Europe's was very depressed.
Mr Geoff Pyne, analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, believes the market can
absorb some leakage from the Opec deal - to take about 24.2m b/d with prices
averaging Dollars 19 a barrel for the second quarter. 'But there are risks
on the downside and there is a possibility the whole thing could unravel.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rawlings hails Ghanaian mine
project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE official opening of Iduapriem, Ghana's newest gold mine, yesterday
President Gerry Rawlings hailed the development as another success for his
liberalised mining investment laws, which have attracted Dollars 900m of new
capital and quadrupled the country's gold production since 1986.
The place where the president made his speech was until two years ago a
remote patch of thick forest in the western region, some 300 km (185 miles)
west of Accra. The mine is owned and operated by Ghanaian Australian
Goldfields, a joint venture between the International Finance Corporation
(20 per cent) the Ghanaian government (10 per cent) and Golden Shamrock
Mines (68.95 per cent), the Australian group controlled by Mr Oren Benton's
Denver-based Concord group which trades 70 per cent of the world's uranium.
After an initial investment of Dollars 10m by GAG, the IFC connection
enabled it to develop Iduapriem with a Dollars 55m loan from a syndicate
made up of the Swiss Banking Corporation, NIG bank of the Netherlands, the
European development agencies DEG and FMO and Ecobank, the West African
regional trade bank. It started production last September and is producing
gold ahead of its target rate of 120,000 troy ounces a year, worth about
Dollars 40m at today's prices.
The ceremony at Iduapriem marked another step in the development of Ghana's
mineral resources, which are concentrated in the Western and Ashanti
regions. Once known as the Gold Coast, this area's wealth had declined since
independence because of inadequate funding until a new mining investment law
in 1986 began to bring back foreign capital and expertise. In the past five
years, Ghana's annual gold production has increased from 250,000 ounces to
more than 1m ounces, and even at today's depressed price of about Dollars
330 an ounce gold has overtaken cocoa as the country's principal export.
Mr Kwami Prepreh, the acting Minister of Energy and Mines said that the
government aimed to double production to 2m a year by 1997.

London COCOA futures finished just below a three-month high, boosted by
active industry demand which helped to absorb some Ivorian selling. Dealers
said there was good two-way business in nearby Ivorian cocoa at between
FF600 and FF605 per 100 kilos. Some estimated that about 20,000 to 25,000
tonnes might have been traded during the day. New York raw SUGAR prices
touched contract highs in early trading, touching buy stops and encouraging
speculative buying. PLATINUM drifted lower on the London bullion market on
continuing bearish technical factors. But it continued to hold initial
support after very volatile trade and a Dollars 16 range seen in Tokyo
overnight. Analysts said that while Monday's sharp plunge in platinum and
PALLADIUM might have condemned both metals to a renewed period of base
building, they had held crucial support areas and should avoid a further
free-fall. One pointed out that both markets were short, as indicated by
firm lease rates.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China becomes biggest user of
gold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA EMERGED as the world's largest gold consuming country last year,
according to estimates from the American Precious Metals Advisors
consultancy organisation.
It suggests China may have consumed more than 800 tonnes of gold or 26m troy
ounces in 1992.
APMA says in its latest MetalsFAX newsletter that China probably imported
500 tonnes to satisfy demand from private gold consumers and another 35
tonnes of domestic gold production was also absorbed. China's central bank
possibly bought another 300 tonnes, either for additions to its reserves or
to help satisfy raging domestic demand, the newsletter says.
Mr Jeffrey Nichols, managing director of APMA, says some market observers
are sure that a substantial part of the 400 tonnes of gold disposed of by
the Dutch central bank last autumn was taken by China's central bank -
perhaps 150 to 200 tonnes (4.8m to 6.4m ounces).
He estimates that central bank net gold sales last year reached 650 tonnes.
In addition to Holland, the big sellers were Belgium (202 tonnes) and Canada
(about 100 tonnes). Other sellers included Iraq and Abu Dhabi, both making
'distress sales', according to Mr Nichols. Iraq sold about 175 tonnes to
keep its economy going while Abu Dhabi sold 125 to 150 tonnes to cover its
losses in the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, APMA suggests.
It says that, apart from the central bank sales, downward pressure was put
on the gold price in 1992 - pushing the price to its lowest level in seven
years - by disposals by the former Soviet Union and short sales by
speculators.
On the other hand, investors are estimated to have bought about 1,000 tonnes
of gold last year compared with 620 tonnes in 1991 and 435 tonnes the year
before. This is 'in stark contrast to the myth presented over and over again
in the media that investors are disinterested in gold and that dishoarding
is driving down the metal's price', Mr Nichols points out.
APMA estimates that the total supply of gold to the market last year - from
the mines, from net central bank sales, producers' forward sales and scrap -
was about 3,750 tonnes (up from about 3,140 tonnes in 1991) while some 2,634
tonnes (2,380 tonnes) was absorbed by jewellery fabricators, industrial
consumers and in coinage.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries soar on sharp drop in
consumer index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR and TRACY CORRIGAN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TREASURY bond prices soared yesterday as the market reacted to an
unexpected sharp drop in the consumer confidence index which more than
offset concern about supply ahead of the afternoon's two-year note auction.
The benchmark 30-year government bond, which broke through the
psychologically important 7 per cent yield barrier on Monday, continued to
set new records yesterday.
In the late afternoon, the long bond was 1 3/8 higher at 103 3/4 , yielding
6.824 per cent. Among shorter-dated maturities, the three-year note added
5/16 to 100 29/32 , yielding 4.286 per cent. The Federal Reserve refrained
from operating in the open market, and Fed funds were changing hands at 2
15/16 per cent in late trading.
Bond prices withstood an early round of selling and a slight decline in the
Dow Jones Utility Average, which has lent support to the bond market's
recent gains. Investor confidence in President Bill Clinton's economic
package remains the main force underpinning the market's bullishness.
News that February's consumer confidence index had fallen to 68.5 in
February from 76.7 in January added to the market's euphoria.
Bidding was weak at the treasury's afternoon Dollars 15.25bn two year note
auction, with a bid-cover ration of 2.14 to 1.
EUROPEAN bond prices proved volatile yesterday as concern about pressure on
the weaker currencies prompted substantial switching between markets.
The Spanish and Italian bond markets again bore the brunt of selling
pressure.
Spanish bonds fell more than half a point, following a  1/2 -point drop on
Monday. Dealers said the Bank of Spain's defence of the currency was seen as
a signal to sell bonds. In addition, short rates rose as high as 20 per
cent, shaking out speculative positions in the bond market which had become
too expensive to fund.
ITALIAN bonds also lost ground as the lira's slide was exacerbated by
political uncertainty ahead of this week's vote of confidence in the
government. Bond prices slid nearly half a point, undermined further by the
weak reception to the latest T-bill auction.
FRENCH bonds also weakened as nervousness increased ahead of next month's
election. Dealers are expecting the spread between the French and German
markets, which has recently increased to about 85 basis points, to widen
further ahead of the election, although the French market would still
benefit from any reduction in German rates.
AFTER rallying more than a point on Monday on expectations of a full-scale
rate cut, the Danish bond market fell back again yesterday when the
suggestion of a rate cut sparked pressure on the currency.
Overnight rates rose as high as 20 per cent, prompting selling of Danish
bonds. The spread between Danish and German bonds widened to 189 basis
points from 176 basis points.
GERMAN bund and UK gilt prices both ended slightly higher, but showed little
fresh direction. The German bond market recovered from earlier weakness,
benefiting from currency concerns in other markets. The gilts market
remained firm, but lacked impetus, as dealers saw no sign of further
interest rate cuts.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Dresdner Bank wins mandate for DM3bn EC
issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community has awarded the mandate for its widely-expected DM3bn
Eurobond offering to Dresdner Bank.
An official in Frankfurt said Dresdner would be the sole bookrunner of the
seven-year issue, the proceeds of which are intended to fund the EC's
previously-announced loan to Italy. The transaction is expected to be
launched today.
There were three offerings in the Eurodollar sector yesterday, which also
saw the pricing of Toyota Motor Corp's Dollars 1.5bn five-year deal at
101.333 to yield 38 basis points above the when-issued five-year US
Treasuries. The pricing was in line with market expectations.
Kidder Peabody launched a Dollars 315m mortgage-backed seven-year
floating-rate note through a special-purpose vehicle, the second real
estate-related issue in less than a week. Last Friday, Merrill Lynch
arranged a Dollars 57.5m five-year FRN for Regency Square Finance Corp,
aimed at refinancing the mortgages on Regency Square Mall in Jacksonville,
Florida. The coupon on the Regency Square notes was 110 basis points above
three-month Libor, and the notes were trading at their launch price of 99.75
yesterday.
The indicated coupon on Kidder's deal, the proceeds of which will be used to
finance 13 shopping malls in the US, is 75 basis points above three-month
Libor. An official at Kidder Peabody said the notes were 'largely placed' by
yesterday afternoon and he expected them to be priced before the indicated
date of March 3.
The Bank of Greece raised Dollars 300m through a 10-year FRN, priced at
99.70 and with a coupon of 75 basis points above six-month Libor. An
official at lead-manager CSFB said that a 'decent chunk' of the offering had
been sold by late yesterday but that it would take a few more days to
complete the placement.
Elsewhere, France Telecom tapped the Swiss franc market, raising SFr150m
through a five-year offering, currently the favoured maturity among Swiss
investors. The bonds were priced at 102.50 with a coupon of 4.75 per cent
and traded inside fees in the grey market, at 101.10 to yield 4.5 per cent.
Swiss and UK investors were reported to have snapped up a SFr75m four-year
convertible issue from Dong Ah Construction Industrial Company, South
Korea's third-largest construction company. The issue was at par, with a
coupon of 3.25 per cent, but the price shot up to 105.50 in grey market
trading, reflecting the strong demand among investors for convertible paper
as well as the rarity of Korean issuers in the equity-linked sector.
Yesterday also saw the first deal from Australia's Treasury Corp of
Victoria, the new, centralised treasury body which has replaced the
now-defunct Victoria Public Finance Authority. TCV is also responsible for
borrowing on behalf of other state entities.
TCV raised ADollars 150m, up from an original ADollars 125m, through a
10-year issue with a coupon of 8 3/4 per cent, priced at 100.35 to yield
8.70 per cent or 60 basis points over comparable Australian government
bonds.
When the bonds started trading, the price fell to 98.50 to yield 8.98 per
cent but was inside fees of 2 per cent.
The yield spread on the bonds is wider than those of other recent 10-year
offerings in the Australian dollar Eurobond market, and reflected TCV's
credit rating of A1/AA.
This compared with a yield spread of 26 basis points above Australian
government bonds on the Australian Industrial Development Corporation's
10-year bonds, launched in January, and 38 basis points on an issue the same
week by the State Bank of New South Wales. Both have higher credit ratings
than TCV.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Japanese trust banks may be
downgraded by S&amp;P
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD and Poor's, the US credit rating agency, has placed four leading
Japanese trust banks under review for possible downgrade.
S&amp;P said long and short-term debts of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking, Mitsui
Trust and Banking, Sumitomo Trust and Banking, and Yasuda Trust and Banking
were being reviewed.
Japan's trust banks have suffered from problem loans and large exposure to
the property market. The banks also face lower fee income on the stock and
land trust businesses due to the slump on both the Tokyo stock market and
property market.
S&amp;P said the four banks were faced with 'a high and still-growing level of
problem loans reflecting the weak real estate market and the sluggish
Japanese economy'.
The credit agency also said the profit ratios of the banks were under
pressure.
S&amp;P also announced the downgrading of Sumitomo Life Insurance's claims
paying ability to AA plus from AAA. Japan's life assurance companies face a
sharp fall in unrealised assets amid the current slump of Japanese shares,
at a time when dividend payments to policyholders are higher than returns on
investments due to lower interest rates and a sluggish stock market.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: French Ecu bond offering
marks market revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG demand for the French government's first issue of Ecu BTANs (French
Treasury notes) yesterday marked a further revival of interest in the
market.
Only a handful of Ecu bond offerings has emerged since the market collapsed
after Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty last June. But the pace
of issuance has picked up since the start of the year. The UK, France and
Finland, as well as the European Investment Bank and the European Community,
have all issued paper this year.
However, the French government's commitment to the market is the most
crucial to its survival. The only Ecu bond futures contract is based on Ecu
OATs, which are generally viewed as the benchmark issues for the whole
market.
The French government last year reaffirmed its policy of raising 15 per cent
of its funding needs through Ecu bond offerings, despite the difficulties
besetting the market, but is well ahead of that target so far this year.
Dealers said the issue appeared attractively priced, relative to other Ecu
issues, and reported strong demand from central banks and UK-based fund
managers and some interest from Japanese investors.
In addition, the five-year BTAN issue provides investors with the
opportunity to play the Ecu bond yield curve, consisting solely of French
government debt, from five years to 30 years.
The Ecu2bn five-year issue also made good economic sense for the French
government. The five-year area is the lowest point of the Ecu bond yield
curve. The 7 per cent notes were priced to yield 7.51 per cent, very close
to the 7.50 per cent yield of five-year French franc government paper.
Until recently, it was more expensive for the government to raise funds in
the Ecu rather than the French franc market, which had raised doubts about
the government's continued commitment to the market.
However, the government plans to add to the five-year BTAN, syndicated by a
group of banks led by Paribas and Credit Commercial de France, by auctioning
further tranches.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: KOP plans to raise FM3bn in
overhaul
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, has announced
plans to raise nearly FM3bn (Dollars 511m) to enable it to avoid for the
moment having to call for direct state support.
The money will be raised through a rights issue and a debt issue in the
domestic and international markets. The issues are part of a broader
overhaul which will include a bonus issue and a reduction in the nominal
value of the bank's shares to FM10 from FM20.
The exercise is designed to keep the bank's international capital adequacy
ratio at 9 to 10 per cent in 1993 and 1994, when it will face further heavy
losses.
'This is an opportunity for our shareholders to take a stand in favour of
private share ownership,' said Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chairman and chief
executive. 'Our aim is to do everything possible to avoid resorting to
government support.'
Halving the value of the group's shares will release FM1.86bn to meet future
losses. However, the group's share capital will be restored to its original
level through one-for-two bonus and rights issues, which will each amount to
FM930m.
The plan is to launch the rights issue at the end of March, without a
government guarantee. Any rights not taken up will be offered to new
shareholders.
The bank says most shareholders have responded positively to the scheme.
In the next stage, the group will seek to raise FM2bn in tier 2 capital
through the domestic and international debt markets.
Mr Teppo Taberman, executive vice-president, said the bank aimed to launch
at least four issues in late 1993 and early 1994, with the international
issues on the European and US markets being guaranteed by the government.
The group said it expected its 1993 result to be 'distinctly better' than
1992's FM3.7bn loss. But the group does not expect to return to profit until
1995.

cuts for two years

<TEXT>
AIR CANADA has asked all its employees to take a 5 per cent pay cut for two
years and receive 'share appreciation rights' to compensate.
The company's payroll is 19,000, down 3,000 since 1990. The pay cut would
save about CDollars 100m (USDollars 80m) over the two years. Mr Hollis
Harris, Air Canada president, said it would make a small operating profit in
1993 and post a final loss, including special charges, of about CDollars
200m. Its immediate objective was to reverse the 1992 decline in yields.
Mr Hollis appealed directly to all operating and maintenance employees over
the proposed pay cut. But the appeal was immediately rejected by the three
biggest unions, which said they had already accepted a one-year freeze.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sharp fall in demand sees Deere
loss deepen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP fall in agricultural machinery sales resulted in the first-quarter
loss at Illinois-based Deere deepening to Dollars 27.6m, or 36 cents a
share.
In the same period last year, the farm equipment manufacturer with worldwide
interests suffered a loss of Dollars 19.9m or 26 cents. Deere also saw
worldwide sales drop, to Dollars 1.424bn, from Dollars 1.452bn in the first
quarter of last year.
As in the first quarter of 1992, Deere instituted a series of factory
shutdowns in an attempt to cut receivables at its equipment dealerships. The
shutdowns contributed to weak profits. The combination of reduced production
and higher first-quarter retail sales helped Deere dealers to cut
receivables by Dollars 186m during the quarter.
While Deere sold fewer pieces of equipment to its dealers, the dealers
themselves reported significantly higher retail sales in North America.
The company said demand remained very weak for agricultural equipment in
western Europe, and its worldwide equipment operations recorded a net loss
of Dollars 68.9m, compared with a Dollars 46.5m loss a year ago.
Deere's financial services and North American lawn and grounds care
equipment business improved, with each posting revenue growth in the
quarter.
'First-quarter North American retail sales levels improved over last year,
and provide a good base for the remainder of the year,' said Mr Hans
Becherer, Deere chairman. But he added that industry retail sales of
agricultural equipment in Europe 'are expected to continue downward.
European agricultural continues to experience a fundamental change which
will likely result in lower income to farmers and reduced crop production in
1993, putting further pressure on our overseas operations results.' Mr
Becherer said Deere planned selective increases in its production schedules
in 1993.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cyanamid to spin off Dollars 1bn
chemicals arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Cyanamid, the US pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, yesterday
said it would spin off its Dollars 1bn chemicals business to shareholders
later this year.
Although the company had announced a restructuring of its chemical
operations as far back as December 1991, and a spin-off was widely expected,
the announcement came earlier than anticipated.
Cyanamid has steadily distanced itself from its chemical operations over the
past two years. It has already sold eight chemicals businesses and last year
its remaining chemical operations were set up as a separate unit, with its
own headquarters, under the Cytec Industries name.
Cyanamid's chemicals business had 1992 operating earnings of Dollars 34m, up
6 per cent from 1991, while sales slid 8 per cent to Dollars 1.05bn. In
contrast, the company's medical group saw sales rise 10 per cent in the year
to Dollars 2.89bn although operating earnings rose a more moderate 3 per
cent to Dollars 395m.
The decision to move away from chemicals to concentrate on higher-margin
drugs and life sciences operations was widely applauded in 1991, at a time
when many pharmaceuticals companies saw earnings growth in the 20 per cent
range.
In recent months, however, Cyanamid's stock price has fallen, along with
other pharmaceutical company issues, amid concern that the Clinton
administration's criticism of high drug prices will translate into slower
earnings growth.
On Wall Street, shares in Cyanamid rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 1/4
yesterday. The stock was unavailable for late trading, following the
spin-off announcement. The spin-off, which is subject to regulatory
approval, is expected to be completed towards the end of the year.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Hyundai abandons its brief
political detour - South Korea's giant has survived Chung Ju-yung's
ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Hyundai recently selected its corporate slogan for 1993, it went for
'The releap year'. The phrase signifies that South Korea's largest
conglomerate is hoping to make a fresh start after a year of turmoil.
The group's problems were caused by the political activities of Mr Chung
Ju-yung, the Hyundai founder. His unprecedented attempt to involve business
directly in politics by standing as a presidential candidate displeased the
government, which applied sanctions against Hyundai.
But Mr Chung's defeat in the December elections, and his withdrawal from
politics, has relieved the pressure on Hyundai. 'We hope that relations
between Hyundai and the government will be normalised this year,' said Mr
Park Il-kwon, Hyundai's spokesman.
Hyundai executives are now assessing the damage inflicted on the group last
year. Penalties included credit squeezes and tax penalties imposed by the
government.
Group sales among its 41 subsidiaries totalled Won42,000bn (Dollars 52.7bn),
slightly below the 1992 goal of Won44,000bn, but a 16 per cent rise from
turnover of Won36,000bn in 1991. Hyundai has set a sales target of
Won50,000bn for 1993.
Estimated earnings declined for at least half of Hyundai's 16 listed
companies. But this reflected mainly sluggish growth in the domestic economy
and weaker demand abroad - factors that also affected other Korean
conglomerates.
Although Hyundai officials last year claimed that credit sanctions were
hampering investment in such key industrial sectors as motor vehicles and
semiconductors, they now admit they exaggerated the problem to persuade the
government to be lenient.
'What last year's events revealed was the strength of the group. It had the
resources to survive,' said Mr John Wadle, an analyst with Barclay de Zoete
Wedd in Seoul.
Other observers believe that Mr Chung created as much trouble for Hyundai as
the government. 'Many of Hyundai's problems were its own fault. They had
their eye off the ball,' explained one analyst.
Mr Chung recruited Hyundai executives to work full-time for his political
party, which caused the disruption of business operations.
The problem was exacerbated during the waning days of the presidential
campaign when Hyundai employees were asked to canvass for Mr Chung. This
caused sales to drop for Hyundai companies in December. The Bank of Korea
blamed the sluggish activity at Hyundai for a fall in the nation's exports
that month.
For example, the domestic market share of Hyundai Motor, the country's
biggest vehicle manufacturer, fell to 38.6 per cent in December, as car
dealers campaigned for Mr Chung. Its market share rebounded to 54 per cent
in January.
Earnings for Hyundai Motor, the biggest industrial subsidiary in the group
with sales of Won6,080bn, consequently fell to Won40bn for the year, against
Won54bn in 1991, instead of rising as had been predicted.
The operating profit for Hyundai Motor Service, the auto sales organisation,
was also halved.
The question surrounding Hyundai is how soon business activity will return
to normal. Although Hyundai managers involved in Mr Chung's campaign
returned to the group after the election, some are in hiding for alleged
election law violations.
They include Mr Choi Soo-il, the president of Hyundai Heavy Industries, the
group's shipbuilding subsidiary, the most profitable unit with estimated
earnings of Won260bn in 1992 on sales of Won2,500bn. His absence coincides
with declining orders for the company.
'The fate of these executives will having a lingering effect on Hyundai,'
explained Mr Stephen Marvin, research director for Jardine Fleming in Seoul.
'Hyundai is an autocratic organisation, and any paralysis at the top affects
overall management. When the generals are gone, the foot soldiers don't know
what to do because mid-level management is weak.'
Hyundai officials admit that Mr Chung's defeat, the arrest of executives and
other adverse publicity about Hyundai has caused morale problems among the
group's 170,000 workers.
But they hope that spirits will rise soon as the departure of Mr Chung from
politics leads to an expected easing of official pressure on Hyundai.
The new government of President Kim Young-Sam wants to revive the flagging
economy. Further attacks on Hyundai would harm that effort since the group
plays a central role in the Korean economy.
Indeed, the government continued to provide business to Hyundai during its
clash with Mr Chung last year.
Hyundai Engineering and Construction, the group's flagship company, won the
tender for the first phase of a project to build a new international airport
in the Seoul area. The construction company, the largest in Korea, is
expected to report a 14 per cent rise in sales to Won3,200bn for 1992, while
net profits will be around Won25bn.
The possibility that the 77-year-old Mr Chung will play a less active role
in Hyundai management, together with his recent sale of shareholdings in the
group to pay for election expenses, might mollify the government.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: IBM posts worldwide 1992 deficit
of Dollars 6.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines lost Dollars 5.5bn in the US in 1992 and
Dollars 1.73bn in Europe, according to a geographical breakdown of results
published yesterday in its annual report.
The report also contains for the first time financial results from two of
the new business units formed under IBM's plan to become a federation of
more autonomous operations.
The two are AdStar, which makes storage systems, and Integrated Systems
Solutions Corp (ISSC), which provides systems integration services.
IBM's geographical profits breakdown shows that the group lost Dollars
6.86bn in 1992 before accounting changes, compared to a loss of Dollars 598m
in 1991. Its US loss of Dollars 5.5bn occurred on Dollars 32.2bn of
revenues, compared to a loss of Dollars 2.4bn in 1991 on Dollars 32.1bn of
revenues.
The European loss of Dollars 1.73bn compared to a 1991 profit of Dollars
1.26bn and was struck on revenues of Dollars 26.1bn, down from Dollars
26.9bn. It made Dollars 126m in Asia-Pacific, down from Dollars 469m in
1991, and Dollars 157m in the rest of the Americas, down from Dollars 204m.
AdStar produced a Dollars 265m loss after restructuring charges but a
Dollars 247m profit before these charges on revenues of Dollars 6.1bn. It
had a return on assets of just 6 per cent. ISSC, which began operating in
1991, reported net earnings of Dollars 30m on revenues of Dollars 1.8bn for
a 2.8 per cent return on assets.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Rate cuts give new impetus to
market in convertible sterling bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE opening of the market in Euroconvertible sterling bonds was given
further impetus yesterday as BPB Industries, the UK building materials
group, brought the third issue the market has seen in three weeks.
This formerly quiet corner of the international capital markets is widely
expected to become a focus of attention in the weeks ahead, with speculation
rife that more prominent companies, ranging from National Westminster Bank
to British Airways, may prefer to raise money through convertibles rather
than an issue of straight equity.
Two factors explain the renewed interest in sterling convertibles.
One is the fall in long-term UK interest rates: 10-year gilt yields were at
7.8 per cent yesterday, 50 basis points lower than a month ago.
Such rates are low by historical standards, tempting corporate treasurers
back into the sterling bond markets. BPB's Pounds 64m, 15-year issue - which
is redeemable after five years - carries a coupon of 7 1/4 per cent, while
the coupon on Northern Foods's Pounds 91m convert-ible was 6 3/4 per cent
and Sun Alliance's Pounds 155m of bonds paid 7 1/4 per cent.
The relative steepness of the UK yield curve helps to explain why such
yields look attractive to investors.
With UK base rates down to 6 per cent, and widely expected to fall further,
funds geared to paying investors a high level of income are in search of
higher-yielding products. An instrument with a 7 1/4 per cent coupon and the
chance to convert into equity looks attractive in such circumstances.
The second factor explaining the sudden appeal of convertibles is the good
run that equity prices have had in recent months.
That has pushed down equity yields, again tempting investors to switch into
higher-yielding instruments. BPB's shares had risen from a low of 123p last
September to 234p yesterday morning, pushing the yield down to around 4.5
per cent.
The pick-up offered by the convertibles, and the chance to lock in some of
the recent equity gains, encouraged BPB shareholders to switch yesterday
into the new instruments. The company's share price fell to 217p at the
close.
The latest batch of issues is generally seen by convertibles experts as
expensive for investors, reflecting the shortage of such bonds and the
growing demand for higher yields.
As a rough guide, according to one, investors look for a coupon at least 3
per cent higher than the yield on the underlying shares, with a conversion
price set at 16 to 18 per cent above the current share price.
The yield pick-up on BPB's bonds was 2 3/4 per cent, while the premium was
15.7 per cent - at the tight end of the ranges indicated when the bonds were
first offered, and seen as expensive given that BPB is an unrated company
standing outside the FT-SE 100.
Nevertheless the bonds were bought up quickly, and the issue was raised from
its initial Pounds 60m.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T to take Dollars 400m stake
in McCaw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph is to buy 14.5m shares in McCaw Cellular
Communications as part of a previous agreement that will ultimately give
AT&amp;T one-third of McCaw's shares, AP-DJ reports from New York.
AT&amp;T will buy the newly-issued Class A shares of McCaw for Dollars 27.625
each, for a total of about Dollars 400m. The purchase provides an up-front
cash infusion for debt-heavy McCaw.
The investment is being made under a previous commitment exercisable by
McCaw while the two companies work toward a definitive agreement for AT&amp;T's
stake in McCaw.
Yesterday's purchase also gives AT&amp;T the right to name one director on
McCaw's board. The purchase is separate from the broad strategic alliance
the two companies announced last November.
At the time, AT&amp;T said it would buy a total of 47.6m shares at an average
price of Dollars 42 a share, for a total of about Dollars 2bn. AT&amp;T also
plans to purchase British Telecom's stake in McCaw for about Dollars 1.8bn,
bringing its total investment in McCaw to Dollars 3.8bn for the one-third
stake.
AT&amp;T and McCaw said the larger transaction was still being negotiated, and
there were no assurances that a final agreement will be reached.
Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks group, and Coca-Cola Enterprises have begun
talks on opportunities for the latter to become a bottler in international
markets.
Coca-Cola Enterprises distributes about 53 per cent of Coca-Cola's US bottle
and can volume and is 44 per cent owned by Coca-Cola.
Coca-Cola was not immediately available for comment. Coca-Cola Enterprises,
which handles the domestic bottling market, said that it was excited at the
growth potential in the international market-place.
Coca-Cola Enterprises said the chairman, Mr Donald Keough, would retire on
April 20, one day after the company's annual meeting.
Mr M. Douglas Ivester, senior vice-president of Coca-Cola, has been
nominated for election through the proxy process to Coca-Cola Enterprises'
board.

<TEXT>
A FURTHER climb in loan losses caused Bank of Montreal's first-quarter
earnings to dip by 5 per cent, despite strong growth in mortgage and
commercial loans.
Earnings dropped CDollars 155m (USDollars 124m), or CDollars 1.12 a share,
in the three months to January 31, from CDollars 164m, or CDollars 1.23 a
share, a year earlier. Return on common equity fell to 12.5 per cent from
15.1 per cent.
Net interest income climbed to CDollars 764m from CDollars 744m, helped by
the receipt of CDollars 29m in overdue interest from Brazil. But this
improvement was offset by a 30 per cent jump in loan loss provisions to
CDollars 162m.
The bank said it expected loan losses for fiscal 1993 as a whole to total
CDollars 650m, up from CDollars 550m last year and almost double the figure
for 1991.
The latest figure includes a general provision of CDollars 100m for hitherto
unidentified losses.

despite charge

<TEXT>
NORDSTROM, the Seattle-based retailer, lifted after-tax profits to Dollars
49.96m in the final three months to end-January.
The results were scored on a 9.3 per cent improvement in sales, at Dollars
1.07bn, and compared with a net profit of Dollars 40.86m in the
corresponding period of 1991-92.
The 1992-93 results would have been slightly higher, had it not been for a
Dollars 4m charge related to the payment of plaintiffs' legal fees in
Nordstrom's recent settlement of a labour class action lawsuit.
As with most retailers, the fourth quarter is the most crucial in the
trading year.

up 7%

<TEXT>
MORGAN Stanley, the New York investment bank, yesterday reported a 7 per
cent increase in net income for both the fourth quarter and 1992 as a whole.
Net income in the fourth quarter to January 31 totalled Dollars 141.8m, or
Dollars 1.68 a share, on revenues of Dollars 695.6m, compared with Dollars
132.3m, or Dollars 1.61 a share, in the quarter to the end of December 1991,
when revenues totalled Dollars 716.6m.
At a pre-tax level, income dipped from Dollars 206m to Dollars 194.8m, but
the net figure was helped by a sharply lower provision for tax (Dollars
52.9m, against Dollars 73.6m), due mainly to lower derivatives revenues from
Tokyo.
Investment banking revenues dipped from Dollars 252.3m in the 1991 quarter
to Dollars 227.9m, while trading revenues dropped from Dollars 246.3m to
Dollars 155.9m.
Revenues from investments rose from Dollars 14.3m to Dollars 33.7m, and
commissions were up from Dollars 73.9m to Dollars 81.7m. Interest and
dividends rose from Dollars 1.15bn to Dollars 1.24bn, while interest expense
was up from Dollars 1.07bn to Dollars 1.1bn.
Expenses excluding interest were held to Dollars 500.8m, down from Dollars
510.6m.
For the full year, Morgan Stanley reported net income of Dollars 510.5m, or
Dollars 5.90 a share, compared with Dollars 475.1m, or Dollars 5.93 a share,
in 1991. Net revenues were Dollars 3.02bn, as against Dollars 2.86bn.
Mr Richard Fisher, the chairman, and Mr Robert Greenhill, president, said
investment banking revenues continued to improve during 1992, with increased
debt and equity underwriting volumes offsetting weakness in financial
advisory services.
Secondary revenues - trading, commissions and net interest - declined 7 per
cent, with record results in foreign exchange offset by declines in equity
derivatives and commodities.

SASOL, the South African synthetic fuel and chemicals producer, overcame
difficult trading conditions to lift attributable profits by 9 per cent to
R584m (Dollars 194m) in the six months to December 25.
Turnover rose to R4.08bn from R3.96bn, but tighter margins saw operating
income fall by 5.4 per cent to R822.3m from R868.8m.
Lower interest payments of R64.1m, against R119.4m, and a lower tax charge
of R158.7m, compared with R208.7m, helped increase attributable earnings.
The company said the operating environment had been 'extremely depressed',
with the prices of chemical products declining and lower refining margins.
Mr Russell Kennedy, general manager, said that, in a trading environment
where prices were flat or falling, the only option before the group was to
control costs and stabilise production at the highest possible level. Sasol
had, therefore, embarked on an extensive cost-cutting campaign. Its benefits
would be apparent for a number of years.
Mr Kennedy said conditions in export markets had been worse than in South
Africa. Although export volumes had been maintained, prices had in some
cases been lower.
Earnings per share rose by 4.7 per cent to 99 cents, and the dividend was
lifted by 4.1 per cent to 38 cents.
The company anticipates profit growth for the full year, in line with levels
achieved for the first half.

A FURTHER climb in loan losses caused Bank of Montreal's first-quarter
earnings to dip by 5 per cent, despite strong growth in mortgage and
commercial loans.
Earnings dropped CDollars 155m (USDollars 124m), or CDollars 1.12 a share,
in the three months to January 31, from CDollars 164m, or CDollars 1.23 a
share, a year earlier. Return on common equity fell to 12.5 per cent from
15.1 per cent.
Net interest income climbed to CDollars 764m from CDollars 744m, helped by
the receipt of CDollars 29m in overdue interest from Brazil. But this
improvement was offset by a 30 per cent jump in loan loss provisions to
CDollars 162m.
The bank said it expected loan losses for fiscal 1993 as a whole to total
CDollars 650m, up from CDollars 550m last year and almost double the figure
for 1991.
The latest figure includes a general provision of CDollars 100m for hitherto
unidentified losses.
The sharp increase in bad debt provisions was blamed on the general weakness
of the North American economy, especially the real estate market.
Non-performing loans stood at CDollars 2.3bn on January 31, up CDollars 126m
from three months earlier.
First-quarter lending was boosted by strong growth in residential mortgages
and loans to small and mid-sized businesses in Canada, and to large
corporate customers in the US.
Harris Bankcorp, Bank of Montreal's Chicago-based subsidiary, posted a 10
per cent rise in net income. But earnings at Nesbitt Thomson, its Canadian
securities arm, tumbled to CDollars 2.3m from CDollars 4m.
The bank ascribed the slump in Nesbitt's earnings to a fall-off in equities
trading activity during the quarter.
Bank of Montreal, with assets of CDollars 106.2bn, is the first of Canada's
big six banks to report earnings for what analysts expect has been a
lacklustre quarter.

WAL-MART Stores, the Arkansas-based discount retailer which grew from one
five-and-dime store to become the nation's largest store chain, yesterday
announced that sales in the year to end-January jumped by 26 per cent, to
Dollars 55.5bn.
Pre-tax profits rose at a roughly similar rate - up by 24 per cent from
Dollars 2.55bn to Dollars 3.17bn.
At the after-tax level, the 1992-3 figure was Dollars 1.99bn, compared with
Dollars 1.61bn in the previous year, and earnings per share (after a stock
split) rose from 70 cents to 87 cents.
Wal-Mart's annual results came after a strong final quarter, during which
sales increased from Dollars 13.6bn to Dollars 17.1bn, and pre-tax profits
rose from Dollars 956.2m to Dollars 1.19bn.
After-tax profits were Dollars 749.6m, against Dollars 602.4m in the same
period of the previous year.
Wal-Mart's strong sales and profits increase partly reflect the rapid
expansion of the store chain - which now encompasses 1,880 discount stores
and 256 Sam's Clubs.
A year earlier, there were 1,720 Wal-Mart Stores and 208 wholesale clubs.
However, Mr David Glass, Wal-Mart's chief executive, also noted that
'same-store' sales growth - the increase in sales from stores which have
been open for more than a year - also ran at a rate of 11 per cent for the
year overall.
Meanwhile, May Department Stores, one of the nation's largest department
store groups and also the owner of the Payless ShoeSource chain, reported
final-quarter profits of Dollars 513m before tax, up from Dollars 406m in
the same period of 1991-2.
May's sales in the three months to January 30 rose from Dollars 3.08bn to
Dollars 3.39bn, while after-tax profits increased from Dollars 266m to
Dollars 319m.
The fourth-quarter results left May posting net profits of 603m for the
year, compared with Dollars 515m.
Annual sales were up from Dollars 8.15bn to Dollars 8.68bn. The St
Louis-based company said that it was pleased with the results, given what it
described as the 'difficult economy'.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Air Canada seeks 5% pay cuts for
two years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AIR CANADA has asked all its employees to take a 5 per cent pay cut for two
years and receive 'share appreciation rights' to compensate.
The company's payroll is 19,000, down 3,000 since 1990, and the pay cut
would save about CDollars 100m (USDollars 80m) over the two years.
Mr Hollis Harris, Air Canada president, said the airline would make a small
operating profit in 1993 and post a final loss, including special charges,
of about CDollars 200m. Its immediate objective was to reverse the 1992
decline in yields.
He appealed directly to all operating and maintenance employees over the
proposed pay cut.
But the appeal was immediately rejected by the three biggest unions, which
said they had already accepted a one-year freeze.
Under share-appreciation rights, employees would receive Air Canada stock
according to the amount of an individual's pay reduction. The hope would be
that the value of the stock would rise as the company recovered.
Mr Harris said senior staff would take the 5 per cent cut and he himself
would accept a 10 per cent cut.
Air Canada, which last Friday disclosed a CDollars 454m final loss for 1992
after restructuring charges, plans to reduce domestic capacity by 10 per
cent this year while increasing international capacity.
The airline is delaying 1993-94 delivery of six Boeing 767-300 aircraft
worth CDollars 700m until 1996-97, and is selling its last Boeing 727s.
It hopes to complete sale-and-leaseback deals for three new 747-400s and
five Airbus A320s to free nearly CDollars 1bn in cash.
Mr Harris said that Air Canada was ready to restart talks for a merger with
Canadian Airlines if its parent, PWA, failed to sign an ownership and
operating pact with American Airlines.
Andres Soriano, one of three Philippine family-controlled groups which set
up PR Holdings, a consortium to take a 67 per cent stake in Philippine
Airlines (PAL), has sold its 5 per cent stake in the consortium, Reuter
reports from Manila.
The sale means the loss of a key ally for Mr Antonio Cojuangco, the
embattled PAL chairman. Mr Cojuangco and Mr Lucio Tan, a Chinese-Filipino
businessman, have been embroiled in a boardroom tussle for control of PAL.
Soriano did not reveal the purchaser of the stake but said it was not Mr
Tan.

biotechnology plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AECI, South Africa's largest chemicals group, is to build a R300m (Dollars
96m) plant producing lysine, an amino acid used in pig and poultry feed.
AECI wants to shift away from commodity chemicals towards higher value-added
chemical products and the biotechnology market.
AECI's heavy exposure to commodity chemicals has hit it hard over the past
three years. Earnings have nearly halved since 1989. Last week, AECI, in
which ICI, of the UK, has a 38 per cent stake, reported a 12 per cent drop
in attributable earnings for 1992, down to R164m.
The plant, to be built at AECI's Umbogontwini factory south of Durban, will
produce 11,000 tonnes of lysine a year.
Start-up is due for 1995. The plant's main raw material will be 30,000
tonnes a year of sugar. The world market for lysine is about 165,000 tonnes
a year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TDK, the Japanese magnetic tape maker, posted a sharp fall in consolidated
profits for the three months to December owing to tough competition in both
audio and video tape markets.
The company said lower profit margins and the audio slump hurt third-quarter
earnings. Pre-tax profits for the quarter plunged 32.3 per cent to Y9.4bn
(Dollars 80.8m) on a 2.8 per cent fall in sales to Y136.5bn. After-tax
profits fell 22.3 per cent to Y5bn.
TDK said sales of floppy discs rose in tandem with the widening of personal
computer ownership. But sales of audio and video tapes fell 5 per cent to
Y47.1m.
Domestic sales fell 8.2 per cent due to the sluggish Japanese economy. But
sales overseas rose 2.9 per cent to Y70.2bn, accounting for 51.5 per cent of
sales, on higher US demand for semiconductors and an increase in magnetic
head sales in Hong Kong.
For the nine months to December, TDK's consolidated pre-tax profits fell
33.7 per cent to Y27.6bn on a 2.4 per cent decline in sales to Y402.6bn.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss foods group, has bowed to pressure from the European
Commission and renegotiated the proposed sale of part of the assets of
Groupe Perrier in an effort to win EC approval for its takeover of the
French mineral water producer.
Under an agreement announced yesterday, Nestle will sell Perrier's Pierval
brand to Castel, a French beverage company, in addition to the other Perrier
brands and springs which Castel agreed two weeks ago to purchase for up to
FFr750m (Dollars 136m).
Castel, which owns the Nicolas wine business, had previously said it was not
interested in buying Pierval because it did not fit in with its existing
mineral water range.
However, Nestle said yesterday that competition authorities in Brussels had
refused to approve the earlier deal with Castel unless it included Pierval.
Pierval was among the Perrier brands which the commission last year ordered
Nestle to sell to a single buyer in an attempt to establish a 'third force'
which would compete with the Swiss group and BSN, France's biggest food
company, on the French mineral water market.
Until Nestle complies with the order, it may not carry out a separate
agreement reached during last year's takeover battle to sell Volvic, another
Perrier mineral water brand, to BSN.
Nestle and Castel would not disclose the price of the Pierval sale, but
expressed confidence that it would enable them to comply fully with the
terms of the EC order.

   PARIS, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAGNIE de Navigation Mixte, the diversified French holding group,
yesterday confirmed its interest in buying Ebro Agricolas, the big Spanish
sugar processor from the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO).
'We cannot but be interested in what happens to Ebro,' a Navigation Mixte
spokesman said. Opportunities to buy an operation like Ebro, Spain's largest
sugar processor, did not occur regularly in the sugar business in which the
French holding company is already involved, he added.
Mr Marc Fournier, Navigation Mixte's president, has said he is actively
examining a possible purchase of Ebro, but has admitted difficulties about
with whom to negotiate.
These difficulties arise, the Navigation Mixte spokesman explained
yesterday, partly because Ebro shares have been used to guarantee bank
credits to Torras, the KIO's Spanish investment company, which has gone into
receivership.
Though it has minority stakes in some companies, 'we generally like to be
the majority shareholder', said the Navigation Mixte spokesman.
In Madrid, the government has warned that it would disapprove of the sale by
the KIO of its 36 per cent holding in Ebro Agricolas, the domestic foods
company, to another foreign group.
Ebro controls an estimated 52 per cent of the Spanish sugar market. 'We want
a Spanish interest to control Ebro,' a Ministry of Agriculture spokeswoman
said. 'A non-Spanish acquisition worries us very much.'
The government's concern came amid reports that European conglomerates were
preparing to take positions in Ebro following a decision by the KIO last
month to award a mandate to Credit Suisse First Boston for the sale.

MANNESMANN, the German engineering conglomerate, suffered a further sharp

The company, which is expected to produce full figures in May, yesterday

network, and heavy extraordinary costs for restructuring.
Net profits in 1991 were DM625m, down from DM1bn a year earlier.
The steel tubes, trading and vehicle components divisions all incurred
losses, while the engineering and plant businesses produced 'clearly
positive returns'. The Brazilian subsidiary returned to profit after two
years of deficit, and earnings from electrical and electronic engineering
were unchanged.
Overall order intake rose 9 per cent to DM27.7bn thanks to the consolidation
of newly-acquired businesses.

SVENSKA Handelsbanken has slid to a higher-than-expected 1992 operating loss
of SKr840m (Dollars 111m) and suspended the dividend on its ordinary shares
after lending losses surged 150 per cent to SKr8bn.
The deficit, which compares with a SKr2.78bn profit in 1991, is the first in
the group's recent history and follows a dramatic deterioration in its
performance in the final four months of the year.
Nevertheless, the result is substantially better than that of its main
competitors, and the group said the prospects for 1993 were brighter. In
particular, it said non-performing loans totalled SKr15.5bn at the year-end,
SKr1.5bn lower than at the end of the first eight months, the first
indication of a downward trend since Sweden's financial sector crisis began.
Mr Arne Martensson, Handelsbanken's chief executive, reaffirmed that the
group would not be looking for state bail-outs to help it manage its
problems.
The figures confirm that Handelsbanken has the best credit portfolio of the
leading Swedish banks, with a proportionally lower exposure to commercial
real estate. Its rival, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, last week unveiled
1992 credit losses of SKr10.9bn, problem credits of SKr28.8bn, and an
operating loss of SKr5.3bn.
Nevertheless, Handelsbanken's credit losses climbed sharply from just
SKr3.2bn in 1991 after doubling to SKr8bn, or 2.8 per cent of total lending,
from SKr3.94bn in the final four months. The group blamed high Swedish
interest rates in the autumn and the depreciation of the krona. Around 60
per cent of the bank's credit losses were connected to real estate, it said.
Handelsbanken's capital adequacy ratio was unchanged at 10.1 per cent at the
year-end.

MANNESMANN, the German engineering conglomerate, suffered a further sharp
fall in profits last year, in spite of a 15 per cent increase in sales to
DM28bn (Dollars 17bn).
The company, which is expected to produce full figures in May, yesterday
blamed the decline on recession, launch costs for its mobile telephone
network, and heavy extraordinary costs for restructuring.
Net profits in 1991 were DM625m, down from DM1bn a year earlier.
The steel tubes, trading and vehicle components divisions all incurred
losses, while the engineering and plant businesses produced 'clearly
positive returns'. The Brazilian subsidiary returned to profit after two
years of deficit, and earnings from electrical and electronic engineering
were unchanged.
Overall order intake rose 9 per cent to DM27.7bn thanks to the consolidation
of newly-acquired businesses. On a like-for-like basis, new contracts fell 7
per cent.
Half of the DM6.4bn in new orders won by the vehicle components business
stemmed from the new VDO and Boge subsidiaries. While business was
relatively brisk in the first half of the year, these businesses were hit in
the second half by the sharp downturn in the German automobile industry.
Tubes, in which Mannesmann has recently announced a series of international
co-operation agreements, saw new business slump by 21 per cent to DM4bn.
The group's new D2 mobile telephone business has already signed up 100,000
subscribers and made sales of DM121m.

THE ELECTRONICS arm of the Dassault group believes it will return to profit
this year on a rising trend of military exports, including its share in
providing on-board computers for the 400 Leclerc tanks that France is
selling to the United Arab Emirates.
Dassault Electronique made a consolidated loss of FFr250m (Dollars 45m) last
year, largely as a result of paying for redundancies announced last summer.
The company, which also makes automatic banking machines, forecast that its
turnover would not change substantially over the next two years from its
1992 level of FFr3.87bn. However, after that time lag, its turnover would
reflect the increase in orders.
These orders would rise from FFr4.05bn last year to FFr5.5bn this year, the
group forecast. At the end of last year, the company's order book stood was
worth FFr7.75bn.

FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fault line splits Spanish
banking sector - Tom Burns examines the results that have produced two tiers
in performance terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Emilio Ybarra, chairman of BBV: 'Last year was the most difficult year in
the last 10.' Banco Popular annual report: 'The shock wave of change has
pervaded these 10 years, radically transforming . . . the very content of
the banking business.' Mr Emilio Botin, chairman of Banco Santander: '1992
has perhaps been the most difficult year since 1982.'
SPAIN'S bank chairmen seem to have hired the same speechwriter. In unison,
they have in recent days complained of diminishing business, of rising
non-performing loans and of high interest rates.
Taken together, the net profits of the top six domestic banks fell by more
than 7 per cent last year. This was the first annual fall in the accumulated
income of the sector's first tier group. It was also a sobering turnaround
from the 50 per cent rise in joint profits that the big banks registered in
1988, at the peak of the sector's growth.
The 1992 results would have been considerably worse had not the Bank of
Spain decided in December to reduce its reserve requirement from 4.5 per
cent to 3 per cent. The move freed some Dollars 6bn of deposits that had
been trapped, interest free, with the central bank.
But while profitability has been squeezed, some institutions are resisting
the pressure considerably better than others.
The 1992 results starkly illustrate a fault line that for the time being has
split the sector down the middle. Three banks - Argentaria, the state-owned
banking corporation, Banco Santander and Banco Popular - reported increased
profits, albeit less spectacular ones than in the past. The other three -
BBV, Banco Central Hispanoamericano (BCH) and Banesto - posted lowered
profits.
This division is new to the Spanish banks. Mr Francisco Luzon, Argentaria's
chairman, says that in the recent past bank results 'were as alike as two
drops of water'. Those similarities reflected tight regulations, such as
reserve requirements, as well as an understanding among the banks to respect
each others' business.
The cosy arrangement within the sector, which was cemented by periodic
lunches among the big bank chairmen, collapsed when Santander launched an
aggressive deposit war in 1989 and began to lure customers away from its
rivals by offering high interest bearing accounts.
Mr Luis Valls, co-chairman of Banco Popular, and the sole surviving bank
president from those quasi-cartel days, says the present slump is not unlike
the one at the start of the 1980s when the economy ground to a halt and bad
debts rose dramatically. 'The difference,' says Mr Valls, 'is that then we
all came out of the banking crisis in step and now our starting positions
are quite different.'
Popular, a well-managed bank, can claim to have a head start. A cautious
risk-taker which is strongly positioned among high net worth domestic
corporates and individuals, it has steadily raised its net income return
from 1.65 per cent in 1988 to 2.12 per cent last year. Popular, half of
whose equity is owned by foreign institutions, has recently begun to lend to
blue chip international companies.
Santander, another profitable performer with a net income return of 1.1 per
cent, has the advantage of a strong international position. Mr Emilio Botin,
its chairman, has little doubt that margins will remain tight in Spain -
non-performing loans are expected to increase this year - and his mid-term
strategy is to raise the current 33 per cent income that the Santander group
earns abroad to 50 per cent.
Mr Botin is likely to exercise warrants in the course of this year that will
lift a 16.5 per cent stake that Santander holds in First Fidelity
Bancorporation of the US to 23 per cent. This development will strengthen
the Spanish bank's already sound balance sheet by permitting the New
Jersey-based bank to consolidate within the Santander group.
Argentaria's 1992 rise in profits could be deceptive for the banking group,
which is the fruit of a 1991 merger that pooled five state-controlled banks,
and the year-on-year results are not strictly comparable.
Mr Luzon, its chairman, however, sees room for increased profitability as
duplication is eliminated although he is concerned about the punitive effect
of high interest rates.
Popular and Santander, which are highly liquid and are net lenders on the
interbank market, have no problems with the high interest rates. The rest of
the sector is less happy with a benchmark intervention rate currently
standing at 13 per cent. 'The evolution of the rates will determine whether
the bank results this year are good or not,' says Mr Luzon, who plans to
place up to 25 per cent of Argentaria on the market this year in a partial
privatisation.
Those banks whose results were not good last year, blamed their tumbling net
profits on the low income earned from disposals. Extraordinary income was
down by 76 per cent at Banesto and by 48 per cent at BBV, but both banks
posted strong improvements in their operating margin.
Mr Emilio Ybarra, BBV's chairman, claims the proof of his bank's recovered
momentum was the 1.25 per cent increase it reported in its market share of
customer deposits. 'Today's market quota is tomorrow's profits,' he said.
Banesto's Mr Mario Conde received a boost of another kind when an
international investment fund led by JP Morgan, the US investment bank,
announced recently that it would spend Dollars 200m in a forthcoming Dollars
452m Banesto rights issue.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BPB shares fall after dividend cut revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard
manufacturer, fell sharply yesterday after the company revealed plans to cut
dividends by a third for the year to March 31.
Following the announcement, the group's share price fell by 7 per cent to
close 17p down at 217p, wiping more than Pounds 84m off the company's stock
market value.
The dividend forecast accompanied the latest euroconvertible bond to be
announced by a British company.
BPB has raised Pounds 64m from a 15 year subordinated bond with a coupon of
7.25 per cent.
The bonds are convertible into 24.8m new ordinary shares at 258p apiece,
representing just under 5 per cent of BPB shares currently in issue.
BPB's share price had risen by 90 per cent since last September following
the end of a bitter European price war between the three largest
plasterboard producers: BPB, Lafarge Coppee of France and Knauf of Germany.
Plasterboard prices in Britain have risen by about a fifth since the
beginning of last year.
Prices in France have increased by about a quarter and in Germany by about
15 per cent over the same period, according to BPB.
Mr Mark Stockdale, construction analyst with Warburg Securities, said the
decline yesterday in BPB's share price was 'due to some investors switching
out of BPB ordinary shares into the higher yielding bonds. There was also
some concern about falling plasterboard sales in France.'
Mr Stockdale said there may have been pockets of disquiet over the extent of
the dividend cut, even though most people had been expecting it.
Mr John Maxwell, BPB's chief executive, said that the company was taking
advantage of the recent strength of its share price and low interest rates
to improve its borrowing profile.
Proceeds of the issue would be used to redeem short-term debt payable within
18 months, which as a proportion of the total loan portfolio would fall from
66 per cent to 40 per cent.
Net debt of Pounds 266m currently was equivalent to 38 per cent of
shareholders' funds. Gearing, however, would fall slightly as a result of
the issue.
The company said that it intended to pay a final dividend of 4.8p for the
year to the end of March, compared with 7.25p at the corresponding stage
last year.
This follows a reduction in the interim dividend from 4p to 2.7p, announced
in November.
Mr Maxwell said: 'Directors felt that it would not be prudent, given the
uncertain outlook for continental European markets in particular, to have an
uncovered dividend. We were required to make a forecast with the issue.'
He said that volume sales which had been 8 per cent higher at the half year
were expected to have risen by only two or three per cent for the year as a
whole following a fall in French sales during the second half.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Regent Inns seeks full listing to raise
funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGENT INNS, the pubs chain, is to seek a full listing to raise new funds,
after yesterday reporting a sharp rise in interim profits.
Regent, an ex-Business Expansion Scheme company, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 603,500 for the six months to January 2, against Pounds 371,390,
after a Pounds 9,400 profit (Pounds 30,865 loss) on disposal of fixed
assets.
Turnover was Pounds 6.47m (Pounds 6.17m). Earnings per share were 5p (2.5p)
and a maiden interim dividend of 2.25p was declared.
A share issue accompanying the full listing, to be sought at the end of
April, is intended to raise about Pounds 5m. Gearing at last June's year-end
was 56 per cent.
Mr Clive Watson, finance director, said the flotation would enable the group
to expand its pubs business. 'It will also provide shareholders with a
better market for their shares and provide greater liquidity,' he said.
Regent Inns operates 36 pubs, hotels and restaurants, mainly in London and
the home counties.
Its largest new venture in the period was Dingwall's Building at Camden
Lock, north London.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Far-flung markets fatten Unilever -
Operating profits rise 18.3% outside Europe and the United States
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER'S long-standing commitment to far-flung markets in the developing
world paid off handsomely last year, when operations outside the United
States and Europe emerged as its star performers.
Operating profits in its 'Rest of the World' sector rose 18.3 per cent from
Pounds 420m to Pounds 497m (Dollars 705.7m), measured at average exchange
rates, while sales increased 15.3 per cent to Pounds 5.34bn.
The operating margin widened from 9.1 per cent to 9.3 per cent, the highest
of any of the group's regional sectors.
The results were boosted by particularly strong showings in central and
south-east Asia and parts of Latin America. Unilever increased volume growth
by more than 10 per cent in 15 countries across the region, and by more than
five per cent in eight countries.
Mr Michael Perry, chairman, said he saw many further opportunities for
growth, particularly in the Middle East, Vietnam and China, where Unilever
recently began making skin care products.
In Europe, operating profit stagnated at Pounds 1.24bn on sales of Pounds
14.5bn - which compared with sales of Pounds 13.8bn the previous year -
while operating margins narrowed from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent.
The company said the flat results were entirely because of exceptional
items, mainly related to restructuring costs, and to disposals, notably of
the 4P packaging subsidiary and agri-business activities. Heavy investment
in eastern Europe also held back margins.
Although professional markets, such as food service, had suffered from
recession, consumer products had held up better in Europe. Personal products
and foods in Mediterranean markets had an 'outstanding' year, while ice
cream and tea had performed strongly and frozen foods had shone in Italy.
The economic decline in Germany had been sharper than Unilever had expected
six months ago, although it expected an upturn by the end of the year.
However, Mr Perry was cautious about prospects in Britain, where there was
no sign of any improvement in trading conditions and volume growth remained
difficult.
He said sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism last autumn
was 'inevitable and desirable' and would help Unilever's British plants to
compete more effectively. But he foresaw no rapid, large-scale shift in
sourcing to the UK.
In the US, operating profit recovered strongly after a poor 1991, from
Pounds 336m to Pounds 385m on sales up from Pounds 4.77bn to Pounds 4.85bn.
Margins improved from 7 per cent to 7.9 per cent.
Mr Perry said the US food business had enjoyed strong volume and profit
increases, although Ragu spaghetti sauce had suffered from fierce price
competition.
Prestige perfumes and personal products did well in the US, but mass markets
proved difficult although demand began to pick up by the end of the year.
Unilever acquired 22 businesses last year for a total of about Pounds 310m,
which will add Pounds 440m to sales on a full-year basis. It made 21
disposals, which raised about Pounds 210m excluding the proceeds from 4P,
most of which were received in January last year.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 5m profit forecast by David Lloyd
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID LLOYD Leisure, the tennis and fitness club which is coming to the
market, is forecasting that pre-tax profits will rise from Pounds 3.01m in
the year to October 1992 to more than Pounds 5m this year.
The profits growth follows the introduction of five new clubs during 1992 to
add to the four existing centres opened since the former Davis Cup tennis
player started the company in 1982.
During the 1993 financial year David Lloyd Leisure expects to open no new
centres. In December, however, it added a 20-lane bowling alley to its
existing centre at Raynes Park and will accrue 10 months' benefit from it
this year.
Mr David Gray, finance director, said the uptake of memberships in January
had exceeded targets.
After the flotation, which will value the group at about Pounds 50m, Mr
Lloyd, chairman, said the group would be in a position to open two centres a
year from the proceeds of the float, the strong cash flow and existing bank
facilities.
Operating profit for 1993 is forecast to be up 33 per cent to at least
Pounds 6m, on sales up 15 per cent at Pounds 18m, while the return on sales
is expected to increase to more than 33 per cent.
After the float the group is expected to have debt of about Pounds 6m and
gearing of about 15 per cent. The issue will be priced on March 4 and
trading begin on March 19. Flemings is adviser and broker.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Amicable cuts bonus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Amicable, the mutual life insurance company, has made one of the
biggest cuts in bonus of the current season.
The Glasgow-based group has reduced pay-outs on 10 year with-profits
policies by more than 15 per cent.
Mr Roy Nicholson, managing director, said that the cuts were caused by the
group's investment focus on small company shares, which had suffered
particularly badly in the recession.
The pay-out on a 10 year policy is being reduced from Pounds 7,331 to Pounds
6,174 (based on a male, aged 29 at outset, paying Pounds 30 per month in
premiums).
However, the poor investments returns earned in recent years have much less
effect on longer term policies. Scottish Amicable is cutting pay-outs on 25
year policies by just 4.7 per cent, from Pounds 62,543 to Pounds 59,602.
The pay-outs represent annual returns of 10.4 per cent for the 10 year
policies and 13 per cent for 25 years.
Although the stock market rose in 1992, most life companies are cutting
pay-outs.

UNILEVER has announced the purchase of Roma, a privately owned Polish ice
cream producer, in the first deal of its kind in the country.
The price was undisclosed, but Unilever is planning a Dollars 17.5m (Pounds
12m) expansion programme after buying out the majority of the factory's
private owners and the Eastern European Development Fund (EEDF), managed by
Invesco CEAM, which held a 31.3 per cent share in the plant. Unilever will
also be covering Roma's capital investment debts.
The EEDF saw Unilever pay some Dollars 3.3m for its initial Dollars 2.3m
investment in the project made less than a year ago.
Roma is located near Gdansk on the Baltic Coast and employs 60 people - it
has a current daily production capacity of 15 tonnes of ice cream. Unilever
has been importing its Cornetto, Viennetta and Magnum varieties under the
Algida name.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Admiral advances to Pounds 3.99m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Admiral, the Surrey-based computing services company, returned profits
before tax of Pounds 3.99m for 1992, a 15 per cent increase on the previous
Pounds 3.47m, despite intensifying competition and a commercial environment
showing no signs of improvement.
Turnover rose from Pounds 26.1m to Pounds 30.9m. Earnings per share were
24.2p (21.9p); a final dividend of 3.7p is recommended for a total of 5.4p.
Mr Clay Brendish, chairman, said the company had performed well in all its
business areas, although the emphasis had changed markedly. Financial
services constituted the company's largest market, accounting for 34 per
cent of turnover, but the proportion of business coming from the commercial
and industrial sectors doubled to 22 per cent.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Provisions continue to curb NatWest's
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank's full-year results for 1992 show the continuing
drag exerted on British high street banks by provisions for possible bad
debts.
They also indicate why there has been market speculation that at least one
bank may seek to strengthen its capital through a rights issue.
Lord Alexander, NatWest chairman, yesterday emphasised how much the bank
would prefer that its home economy was a low inflationary one, in which
'extreme economic cycles' were avoided.
Given the effect of the cycle from the late 1980s to today on his bank, he
has good reason to want stability.
The bank achieved a healthy 16 per cent rise in profits before provisions,
after ignoring the 'fifth quarter' from its Lombard credit finance
business's adjustment of year-end. It achieved a 15 per cent increase in
non-interest income, raising the proportion to 43 per cent of total income.
However, the uncomfortable surprise in the results was the degree to which
the bank's burden of provisions is continuing to hold back its pre-tax
profits.
This in turn contributed to the bank having to pay an uncovered divided, and
weakening its tier 1 ratio of core capital to assets to 5.2 per cent.
Mr Derek Wanless, chief executive, emphasised that it was 'the length and
depth of the recession' rather than poor lending decisions in the late 1980s
that was to blame. A rise in non-performing loans to Pounds 5.1bn (Pounds
3.7bn) indicates that this year may also be tough.
Last year's recession brought down many of the small and medium-sized
businesses to which NatWest is one of the main two bank lenders. Mr Wanless
said 47.6 per cent of UK provisions were on lending to businesses which had
borrowed less than Pounds 50,000, and 77 per cent were in the south.
The provisions were directly charged to the profit and loss account - taking
the UK branch business into a Pounds 140m loss. But non-performing loans
also had a depressing effect on net interest income, costing the bank Pounds
600m to fund compared with only Pounds 400m in 1991.
As a result, NatWest faced a weakening of tier 1 capital to levels which
could have raised eyebrows. After paying a dividend with 0.7 times cover,
the ratio fell to 5.2 per cent. This ratio could have approached 5 per cent
if the bank had accepted the full effect of a property revaluation.
While 5 per cent is still a percentage point above the 4 per cent required
by the Bank for International Settlements, it is regarded as the comfort
limit preferred by the Bank of England.
Lord Alexander insisted yesterday that the bank could meet a Pounds 17bn
rise in assets on current capital. But without any adjustments, that would
push tier 1 capital below 4.5 per cent. This is the stimulus for speculation
about rights issues, although Lord Alexander quashed such talk.
The bank has other solutions if things started looking tight. It made an
issue of Pounds 200m in undated subordinated notes last year, which it can
convert into cumulative preference shares at 30 days' notice. Such a move
would add 0.2 percentage points to its tier 1 ratio.
NatWest could make another such issue, either in Britain or in the US. It
could also remove Pounds 5bn in liquid assets, and a further Pounds 5bn in
market placings dated over one month from its balance sheet if there was
strong loan demand.
Nonetheless, the weakening of tier 1 capital indicates the sort of problems
other banks could face in lending into a strong recovery. No matter how
strong are rises in fees and other non-interest income, it shows how heavy
the weight of provisions and non-performing loans remains.
The questions raised by NatWest apply strongly to Barclays, which is due to
report its 1992 results next week. Barclays is NatWest's main rival in the
small and medium-sized lending that has caused trouble. It too could face
questions about its capital strength if it has had a similar experience.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Inntrepreneur failures increase - Difficult
trading conditions mean rise of over 9% in last six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FAILURE rate among Inntrepreneur Estates' pub leaseholders increased to
more than 9 per cent during the last six months, Mr David Tagg, chief
executive of Grand Metropolitan's property and UK retailing operations, said
yesterday.
Mr Tagg told shareholders at GrandMet's annual meeting that since the
Inntrepreneur joint venture with Courage was established two years ago,
leasehold failures had averaged between 4 per cent and 5 per cent a year.
'This has increased recently because of the difficult trading conditions,'
he said.
About 20 Inntrepreneur licensees, protesting that the terms of the leases
were driving them into bankruptcy, picketed the meeting with placards
calling for lower rents.
Inside, Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, told shareholders
that 'only a very small minority' of Inntrepreneur's 4,700 leaseholders were
not trading successfully. 'Rents are not being imposed,' he said. 'They are
agreed by both parties.'
Mr Terry Carpenter, a shareholder and licensee, invited Sir Allen to visit
Inntrepreneur's pubs in South Wales. 'I will give you a pound for every
successful one you can find,' he said. 'I will not lose much money. 80 per
cent of the pubs that are shut belong to Inntrepreneur or GrandMet.'
When another shareholder asked what the company thought of its relations
with leaseholders, Sir Allen replied that the line was 'always a difficult
one to draw.' He added: 'One cannot simply be a nice guy, much as one would
like to be.'
Mr Tagg said: 'Sometimes we have to take court action in the interests of
the company and shareholders to recover arrears of rent or the repossession
of a pub . . . but we are ready to talk to individual lessees about their
problems and do what we can to help.'
Another shareholder, Mr Charles Adams, suggested that the cost of more
lenient treatment of leaseholders in trouble would be very small. 'I doubt
if it would affect the dividend, and if it did, I am sure ordinary
shareholders would be only too pleased to pay,' he said.
Sir Allen said that although Inntrepreneur was still experiencing a
difficult property market, it was now benefiting from lower UK interest
rates.
A revaluation of the estate will be made in September. Last year's
revaluation led to an 11 per cent write-down and cash injections of Pounds
32m from both GrandMet and Courage.
'If it is necessary to put more money in, then we shall do it,' said Mr
David Nash, finance director.
On GrandMet's current trading, Sir Allen said that conditions in the UK and
Europe continued to be challenging but there were 'definite signs of
improvement' in the US.
Currency fluctuations would have a significant favourable impact on 1993
results though balance sheet borrowings would also be increased.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Bradford &amp; Bingley hit by higher bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRADFORD &amp; Bingley building society revealed a 15.3 per cent drop in pre-tax
profits for 1992 after making provisions for bad mortgage debts of Pounds
81m, compared with Pounds 30.4m in 1991.
After the provisions, pre-tax profits for the year were Pounds 91.3m (Pounds
107.8m).
Operating profits increased from Pounds 138.2m to Pounds 172.3m, helped by a
widening in interest margins. Net interest receivable was higher at Pounds
237m (Pounds 201.4m), despite the effect of Pounds 44.5m of interest deemed
to be irrecoverable.
The society, Britain's seventh largest, said that 'continuing recession and
rising unemployment caused some difficulties for mortgage borrowers. As a
result arrears levels remain high, although possessions taken in during the
year were more than 38 per cent below 1991.'
The society's assets grew 9.6 per cent over the year to Pounds 13.1bn and
reserves rose to Pounds 552.7m (Pounds 489.8m).
Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said
the results were creditable considering that the society was facing the
difficulty of absorbing Leamington Spa, with which it merged in 1991.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Sharp fall to Pounds 58m at Sedgwick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION AND low insurance rates in the United States led to a sharp fall
in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 82.4m to Pounds 58.2m, at Sedgwick Group,
one of the UK's biggest insurance brokers.
Business was also adversely affected by a shrinkage in the London insurance
market, a decline in interest rates worldwide and a sharp rise in
underwriting losses at River Thames Insurance, the insurance company in
which Sedgwick has a 49 per cent share.
A final dividend of 3p is proposed, cutting the total for the year from 12p
to 6p. Earnings were Pounds 35.5m and earnings per share 8.3p, compared with
Pounds 54.6m and 12.8p in 1991 respectively.
Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, said the group was focusing on 'increasing
revenue' in 1993, but warned that 'no significant improvement' was expected.
Executives were downbeat about prospects for US insurance rates, where
despite recent losses, rates remain competitive. Some 40 per cent of
Sedgwick's revenues are generated by its US operations.
'We have seen some tightening in the reinsurance market,' said Mr Quill
Healey, head of Sedgwick's US operation, 'but not much of it has fed through
on a day-to-day basis. We are seeing some change in Florida but in general
it just hasn't happened yet.'
Brokerage and fee income rose by Pounds 10m to Pounds 631.9m, but interest
and investment income fell to Pounds 53m (Pounds 63.2m). Expenses rose 2 per
cent to Pounds 608.8m.
Operating profit dropped to Pounds 76.1m (Pounds 92.7m). Associates' losses
amounted to Pounds 3.1m (profit Pounds 1.4m).
Insurance underwriting profits amounted to Pounds 900,000 (Pounds 1.5m).
Interest payable rose to Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 13.2m), reflecting an increase
in borrowings from Pounds 96m to Pounds 156m during the year.
Profitability of the EW Payne reinsurance subsidiary fell by approximately
Pounds 4m, a decline of 25 per cent compared with 1991. Brokerage declined
by Pounds 5m to Pounds 63.1m, reflecting the sharp contraction in capacity.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lower interest helps Porvair advance 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORVAIR, which manufact-ures microporous plastics and metals for clothing
and industrial applications, lifted pre-tax profits by 20 per cent in the
year to November 30.
Profits benefited from last February's Pounds 3.3m rights issue which cut
interest charges by Pounds 163,000 to Pounds 263,000. Debt and gearing fell
from Pounds 3.59m and 36 per cent before the rights issue to Pounds 3.15m
and 28 per cent at the year-end.
The rights proceeds also funded July's Pounds 2.4m purchase of Accumatics
Filtration, a producer of porous metal materials for use in filtration.
Porvair Ceramics, which markets pressure casting equipment and microporous
moulds, lost Pounds 230,000 and took a write-off of Pounds 207,000 of
marketing and development costs.
Group turnover was Pounds 17.9m - including Pounds 1.05m from acquisitions -
against Pounds 16.6m.
The tax charge for the year was lower than expected at Pounds 388,000
(Pounds 347,000) after previous over-provisions. Earnings per share rose to
11.6p (10.5p). The final dividend is lifted to 2.4p (2.1p) for a total of
3.6p (3.2p), an increase of 12.5 per cent.
The company said it was looking for suitable acquisitions in filtration and
medical diagnostic devices.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Howden purchase and Pounds 31m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOWDEN GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineering concern hit hard by a Danish
tunnelling contract, has, in an unconnected move, agreed to buy Novenco
Industries, a Danish manufacturer of industrial fans, and has proposed a
rights issue to raise Pounds 31.4m to fund the purchase and to reduce bank
borrowings.
Although Howden expects that the total cost of Novenco - which consists of
five fan engineering companies - will be about Pounds 22m, the actual
consideration will equal Novenco's net asset value at December 31 1992 -
expected to be no more than Pounds 7.9m. The UK group will also pick up a 50
per cent interest in a property in Naestved, Denmark, for Pounds 1.3m. On
top of that, Novenco's borrowings of about Pounds 7.8m have to be repaid and
about Pounds 5m will be needed to integrate Novenco's operations with
Howden's air and gas handling division.
Mr Alan Maclachlan, Howden company secretary, said that the remainder of
rights cash - about Pounds 9.4m - would reduce group debt, which stood at
about Pounds 32m at the end of January, and would reduce gearing from 33 per
cent to 'nearer the 20 per cent level'.
Novenco, which in the year to April 30 made pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.8m on
turnover of Pounds 45.3m, makes large and medium-sized fans, said Mr
Maclachlan, adding that it accounted for less than 5 per cent of the
turnover of Danisco, its parent and Denmark's biggest sugar producer.
Howden said Novenco's installed product base was outside its own traditional
geographical markets. Novenco is strong in Scandinavia, especially Denmark,
the Far East, and has small operations in the UK, Canada and the US.
Howden's main markets are South Africa, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands
and France.
Mr Maclachlan stressed that no Howden plant in the UK would close as part of
the integration. He added that the resultant spread of the installed base
would be good for the provision of spares, a higher margin market than fan
manufacture.
The rights issue, underwritten by Robert Fleming, is on a 2-for-7 basis at
52p per share. The new shares will qualify for the final dividend in the
year to April 1993, forecast to be 1.4p.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Baldwin's Pounds 2.7m cafe purchase
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BALDWIN, the holidays, printing and properties group yesterday announced it
would pay Taylor Walker, a subsidiary of Allied-Lyons, Pounds 2.65m cash for
the Muswell's cafe-bar-restaurant chain.
Baldwin this week announced an 8.2 per cent increase in profits for the year
to end-October.
The company said it would pay for the outlets from its own resources.
The cost of the 27 outlets, based mainly in the south and south-east of
England, represents the value of the assets acquired, the directors said.
The acquisition is part of the company's attempt to expand its interests in
the restaurant, catering and leisure business.
In October 1992, it acquired Simpsons of Cornhill, which owns and manages
six restaurants in London, including the famous City chop house, as well as
a restaurant in Oxford.
The company also owns Keycamp, a tour operator.
Mr Sandy Singh, chief executive, said the acquisition showed 'Baldwin's
determination to be a market leader in what it believes to be the growth
sector of the industry.'

the end of 1991. The value has risen by a further 9 per cent since the
latest year-end, according to Mr Andrew Perloff, chairman.
Earnings per share for the six months edged ahead to 1.46p (1.45p). The
interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p; a final of at least 1.2p is
forecast.

<TEXT>
A number of banks, which 18 months ago launched a Pounds 53m rescue of
Charles Church, the Surrey-based housebuilder, have agreed to put more money
into the business.
A group of ten leading shareholders led by Royal Bank of Scotland are
understood to have provided about Pounds 5m of additional working capital to
the company.
Mr Stewart Baseley, chief executive, said the money would be used to buy
land.
He said that house sales by the group were currently almost double that of
the corresponding period last year.
In 1991, some 16 banks agreed to swap Pounds 53m of borrowings for an 81 per
cent stake in the group.
Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday: 'We have been extremely pleased with
the company and its management who substantially have met the objectives set
down two years ago. We now perceive that the time is right to be investing
in the company to provide for future growth.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: SB's new drugs show strong divisional
growth in sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIVEN THE inevitable decline in sales of Tagamet, the anti-ulcer drug and
SmithKline Beecham's best-selling product whose US patents expire next May,
the growth of SB's drugs division will be dependent on its ability to
develop and market new medicines.
Yesterday's results demonstrated the strength of the group's drugs pipeline
as well as the power of its marketing effort.
The new drugs increased their sales by Pounds 212m, representing nearly half
of pharmaceuticals sales increase.
This growth is vital if SB is to offset ever-tightening price controls. Its
worldwide drugs sales actually suffered a 0.5 per cent fall in prices
following a 16 per cent price cut in Japan for Tagamet. Of the group's 11.4
per cent sales growth, 9 percentage points were generated by volume, and
only 1 per cent by prices. The remainder was currency driven.
The star performer among the new products was Engerix-B, a recently-launched
hepatitis vaccine, whose sales improved from Pounds 103m to Pounds 267m. Mr
Jan Leschly, chairman of SB pharmaceuticals, said only Pounds 50m of Engerix
sales were in the US paediatric market which might be affected by price cuts
threatened by the new White House administration.
Relafen, an arthritis treatment, generated sales of Pounds 175m during its
first 10 months in the US, said Mr Leschly. Its worldwide sales increased
six times to Pounds 118m. Seroxat, an anti-depressant, generated sales of
Pounds 26m. It was launched two weeks ago in the US by a salesforce of 1,800
representatives. Sales of Kytril, an anti-nausea product, were Pounds 31m.
The product launches were not without cost. Group selling general and
administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) increased from Pounds 1.55bn to Pounds
1.84bn. As a proportion of group sales, SG&amp;A rose from 33.1 to 35.2 per
cent. Group margins fell 0.7 percentage points to 21.9 per cent. The drugs
division's sales and marketing spend increased 13.6 per cent to Pounds 789m.
Meanwhile, sales of some established drugs were also impressive. Augmentin,
an antibiotic, increased 14 per cent to Pounds 589m.
Research and development investment rose from Pounds 432m to Pounds 478m,
equivalent to 9.2 per cent of sales.

A SUBSTANTIAL increase in activity in the final quarter enabled Hewitt
Group, the industrial ceramics and refractories maker, raise pre-tax profits
by 33 per cent from Pounds 625,000 to Pounds 832,000 in 1992.
Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 7.76m. Earnings per share grew from 11.4p
to 14.8p, while a proposed final dividend of 1.75p makes a total for the
year of 3p (2.5p).
Mr David Heynes, chairman, said that after a relatively disappointing third
quarter there was a sharp improvement as a result of the devaluation of
sterling, together with certain customers increasing orders to rebuild their
stock to normal levels.
Considerable progress had been made at Hewitt's factories in Stoke-on-Trent
and Triptis, Germany. The Triptis factory will become fully operational in
mid-1993.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Chemicals falls 8% and calls for
Pounds 24.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Chemicals, the dyes and specialist materials group, is to raise
Pounds 24.3m through a 1-for-5 rights issue at 330p, in order to fund its
capital expenditure programme over the next two years.
The rights issue was priced at a 17.5 per cent discount to the 401p price
prevailing before yesterday's announcement. Yorkshire's shares closed down
1p.
The proceeds will strengthen the group's balance sheet and will prevent
gearing from doubling to about 40 per cent as it might have done.
Reporting an 8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 11m to Pounds
10.1m in the year to December, the company said demand remained strong and
constraints on production capacity had led the group to contract out
production to an increasing extent.
The company said it had grown rapidly largely through organic growth but
that it was engaged on a significant investment programme to support
continued expansion.
The board expected to spend about Pounds 16m this year and the balance of
the rights proceeds next year which would substantially increase production
capacity.
The pre-tax result was struck on turnover up 5.6 per cent at Pounds 98m
(Pounds 92.8m). Operating profits declined to Pounds 11.5m (Pounds 12.1m)
while net interest charges increased from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 1.41m.
Earnings per share fell from 20p to 18.4p and the board is recommending a
final dividend of 5.15p, making a total of 7.65p (7.25p) for the year.
The new shares will not be eligible for the final divi-dend.
The fall in profits was well-flagged. Mr Philip Lowe, chairman, said sales
and margins had continued to be affected by deteriorating world trading
conditions in 1992 and were also hit by the weakness of the US and
Australian dollars.
The rights issue is fully underwritten by Kleinwort Benson.
COMMENT
Whatever the virtues to raising cash to strengthen the balance sheet one has
to wonder why yesterday's rights issue was quite so deeply discounted. By
opting for expansion with equity rather than debt, Yorkshire has clearly
opted for the most conservative route. But one wonders whether the company's
advisers have really earned their underwriting fee at this price. Another
consequence of the issue is that shareholders will be rather more heavily
diluted than they might have needed to be. As a result, the shares are
unlikely to continue their recent strong performance. After taking into
account the right issue proceeds, pre-tax profits are likely to rise to
Pounds 14.3m this year, giving 22.3p of earnings and a prospective multiple
that now looks fairly full at nearly 18 times.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Unipart bucks recession with 29% rise to
Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIPART, the motor parts and accessories manufacturer and distributor,
increased pre-tax profits in 1992 by 29 per cent to a record Pounds 19.1m,
despite one of the most severe recessions in the UK motor industry's
history.
The results reflected productivity improvements and cost base cuts which
have been in progress since Unipart first began adopting Japanese-style
working practices in 1989.
Pre-tax profits in 1991, also a year of deep recession for the motor
industry, had risen by 17 per cent.
However, a decision to end trade union recognition last spring played a
significant role in the profits rise from 1991's Pounds 15.4m, according to
Mr John Neill, chief executive.
Sharp productivity increases, as high as 30 per cent in the contract
distribution division, had been achieved last year, said Mr Neill.
The company, which employs 3,800 people, has four principal operating
companies with a combined turnover last year of Pounds 661.4m, up 17 per
cent on the comparable Pounds 566.7m.
Other contributors to the record results were the coming on stream last year
of Premier Exhausts, a new Coventry-based catalytic exhaust and catalytic
converter plant supplying Rover and Honda; more than Pounds 2m saved by
Unipart's own form of Japanese 'quality' circles, and new products such as
car immobilisers.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Philips strengthens Grundig ties

PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, plans to boost co-operation with
Grundig, its 31.6 per cent-owned German affiliate, in a renewed effort to
revive both companies' consumer electronics operations.
The Dutch company also said it would consolidate Grundig in its own accounts
starting with the 1992 financial year. The move is seen as a signal of
Philips' determination to integrate and rationalise loss-making Grundig.
The Dutch company - whose 1992 results on March 4 are expected to show the
extent of the difficulties it faces in consumer electronics - said 'drastic
cost reductions can only be achieved if both companies avoid duplication of
efforts, especially in the areas of development and manufacturing'.
Philips declined to say what kind of rationalisation it had in mind,
although it noted that the two companies had already agreed to combine
efforts in production of video cassette recorders and cordless telephones.
Mr Joost van Beek, an analyst at Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson in Amsterdam,
said a similar arrangement in television set production could be next.
Philips said it had no plans for boosting its stake in Grundig and
emphasised that Grundig would retain its own corporate identity.
Philips said the consolidation would have no effect on Philips' bottom line
when the company publishes 1992 results next week, as Grundig's figures
would have been included anyway under 'net income from non-consolidated
companies'.
However, Philips' shares fell by 3.8 per cent to Fl 22.60 as the Amsterdam
stock market focused on the company's statement that it had a long-standing
agreement to finance Grundig's losses.
Grundig, which posted a loss of DM19m in 1991/92, is expected to lose more
than DM200m (Pounds 84.7m) in 1992/93.
Philips promised to give details of its funding commitment to Grundig when
it releases its results.
Philips, which appoints Grundig's management, acquired a 24.5 per cent stake
in the company in 1979 and raised this to 31.6 per cent in 1984, the year in
which it undertook to guarantee funding for any losses.

FT  24 FEB 93 / SmithKline Beecham advances 11% on increased turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM, the Anglo-US drugs and consumer products group,
yesterday reported full-year pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 up
11 per cent from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 1.12bn.
The results were achieved on turnover up 11.4 per cent from Pounds 4.69bn to
Pounds 5.22bn. Mr Bob Bauman, chief executive, said they showed the group
was well prepared to cope with the increasingly tough pricing environment
for drugs in the US and elsewhere.
Sales of Tagamet, the ulcer drug and SB's best-selling drug, fell from
Pounds 620m to Pounds 614m. About half of the drug's sales will be affected
by the expiry of its US patents in May next year.
Tagamet would represent only 10 per cent of group sales by 1994. During the
following two years, Mr Bauman predicted US sales would fall not more than
50 per cent. This would be an improvement on ICI's recent performance with
Tenormin, a heart drug, which lost 50 per cent of US sales in only 12 months
after its patents expiry.
Mr Bauman set out his strategy for defending Tagamet. He hoped to launch a
non-prescription over the counter (OTC) version of Tagamet in the US before
May next year.
In addition, the group might offset the full impact of the patents expiry by
manufacturing the product for a generic drugs company, he said. SB would
also package Tagamet with other drugs in deals with US healthcare
organisations in an effort to maintain Tagamet sales.
Pharmaceuticals operating profits rose 9 per cent from Pounds 694m to Pounds
758m on turnover up 17 per cent at Pounds 2.89bn (Pounds 2.47bn). Underlying
sales growth - excluding currencies - was 15 per cent.
Consumer brands' trading profits rose 5 per cent from Pounds 232m to Pounds
244m on turnover up 2 per cent at Pounds 1.38bn (Pounds 1.36bn). Animal
health trading profits fell 2 per cent from Pounds 63m to Pounds 62m on
turnover of Pounds 337m (Pounds 318m). Clinical Laboratories reported
profits up 14 per cent from Pounds 68m to Pounds 77m on turnover of Pounds
609m (Pounds 539m).
Net debt fell from Pounds 502m to Pounds 392m, while gearing dropped from 42
per cent to 24 per cent. Earnings per share increased from 24p per share to
27.3 p. Earnings per ADR equity unit were 136.5p (120p). The last quarter
dividend is 2.375p per share, making 8.6p for the year (7.7p).

FT  24 FEB 93 / Unilever improves 13% in spite of difficult conditions:
Strong fourth quarter helps Anglo-Dutch group to Pounds 2bn profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, increased
pre-tax profits 13 per cent last year to Pounds 2.03bn, helped by a recovery
in North America and a strong performance in Latin America and Asia.
Mr Michael Perry, chairman, said the result, which compared with Pounds
1.79bn in 1991, had been achieved in spite of difficult conditions,
particularly in the US and Europe. 'Economic recovery proved to be an
illusion in many of our major markets,' he said.
Though the result augured well for this year, it was too early to be
confident that the economic environment would be any less harsh. He saw no
sign of any improvement in UK trading conditions and did not expect the
economy to recover rapidly. However, he hoped for an upturn by the end of
the year in Germany after a deeper than expected economic decline.
Unilever's fourth quarter pre-tax profit rose 13 per cent to Pounds 522m
from Pounds 461m on a 5 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 6.37bn (Pounds
6.08bn). Full-year turnover grew 7 per cent to Pounds 24.7bn (Pounds
23.16bn), and operating margins remained static at 8.6 per cent. Underlying
volume growth rose to 2.5 per cent from 1 per cent, though it remained below
the group's 4 per cent target.
Mr Perry said that though the sterling devaluation had affected only the
fourth quarter, the impact of currency instability was evident in the fact
that earnings for the full year grew 9 per cent when measured at constant
exchange rates, 12 per cent in sterling, 5 per cent in Dutch guilders and 13
per cent in US dollars.
At constant exchange rates, full year turnover grew 4 per cent and pre-tax
profits 11 per cent.
Most of Unilever's consumer products businesses performed well, with a
particularly strong showing by personal products and detergents. However,
operating profits in meals, meal components and professional markets fell in
the year, while speciality chemicals turned in flat results.
Exceptional items helped Unilever's North American businesses to lift
operating profits 14.6 per cent but, along with the effects of disposals,
produced a flat result in Europe. However, Unilever's underlying performance
in Europe proved resilient.
In the rest of the world, the strong growth of a number of regional
economies helped the group raise operating profit by 18 per cent, while the
loss in Japan was reduced.
Interest costs fell to Pounds 148m (Pounds 276m), reflecting lower rates and
a reduction in debt to Pounds 1.2bn from Pounds 1.5bn, which lowered gearing
to 18 per cent from 28 per cent.
Earnings per share rose 12 per cent to 69.14p (61.62p) in the full year and
by 28 per cent to 20.3p (15.8p) in the fourth quarter. The final dividend is
raised to 15.6p (13.91p), bringing the full year total to 20.8p (18.94p).

FT  24 FEB 93 / US court prevents Costain coal-mining sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MISSOURI court yesterday granted a permanent injunction preventing
Costain, the UK construction group, from selling its Australian coal-mining
business for Dollars 245m (Pounds 172.5m) to Altus Finance, a subsidiary of
Credit Lyonnais, the French bank.
Peabody, the US-based coal subsidiary of Britain's Hanson group, had asked
the court to block the deal on the grounds that Costain had originally
agreed to sell it the business for Dollars 200m. Both Altus and Peabody
would also have assumed ADollars 120m (Pounds 57.6m) of debt.
The ruling by Judge Stephen Limbaugh in the US district court in St Louis
revealed that Bouygues, the large French construction group, had considered
making a bid for the whole of Costain last October.
Credit Lyonnais, which had been advising Bouygues, subsequently made an
offer itself through Altus for Costain's Australian coal mining and property
interests. Peabody argued that it had previously been given exclusive
negotiating rights.
Peabody said that the court's decision justified its belief that Costain had
entered a binding agreement. Mr Irl Engelhardt, Peabody's chief executive,
said: 'We intend to contact Costain in an attempt to reach an understanding,
whereby we will be able to proceed with the purchase of their Australian
coal operations.'
Costain said it would need to study the judgment before making a full
statement later today.
It needs to sell its Australian subsidiary to reduce its large borrowings.
In December it negotiated a three-year loan facility with its bankers. The
deal was based upon the group receiving proceeds from the sale to Altus.
It was not clear last night whether all or part of this deal will need to be
renegotiated. Shareholders which previously approved the sale to Altus will
now have to approve a sale to Peabody if a deal is to be done with the
Hanson subsidiary.
One consolation may be that the deal negotiated with Peabody in the autumn
is now worth more in pounds because of sterling's devaluation. The sterling
cost of Costain's borrowings will also have risen.
Costain's borrowings of Pounds 344m last autumn, including Pounds 52m of
loans due on the Spitalfields commercial property joint venture in London,
compared with shareholders funds of Pounds 276m at the beginning of last
year.
Peabody operates open cast and deep coal mines in the US, and is the second
largest private coal producer in the world. It has been identified by Hanson
as one of the core businesses it wishes to expand.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Rising provisions at NatWest limit recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNEXPECTED rise in National Westminster Bank's provisions for possible
bad debts last year limited the bank's rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
405m from Pounds 110m the previous year, it was announced yesterday.
The bank's 1 per cent increase in the charge for possible bad debts to
Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds 1.88bn) was mainly caused by a rise in provisions in UK
branch business to Pounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.2bn). Nearly half the UK
provisions were on loans of less than Pounds 50,000. Operating surplus
before provisions rose 20 per cent to Pounds 2.43bn (Pounds 2.03bn).
Underlying growth was 16 per cent to Pounds 2.36bn, after excluding a 'fifth
quarter' from the change in year-end of its Lombard credit finance
operation.
Lord Alexander, chairman, said provisions on small loans showed the impact
of the recession on medium and small-sized businesses. The bank would be
'best served in the future by the avoidance of extreme economic cycles'.
Strong contributors to profits included commission on foreign exchange
trading, which earned Pounds 228m (Pounds 136m). NatWest Bancorp, the US
retail bank subsidiary, made a profit of Pounds 109m (Pounds 182m loss)
after provisions for bad debts fell to Pounds 100m (Pounds 327m). The bank
also achieved a 15 per cent rise in non-interest income to Pounds 2.93bn.
Commission income rose 11 per cent to Pounds 2.29bn (Pounds 2.06bn), partly
because of higher charges in UK banking.
Losses in the UK branch business increased to Pounds 140m (Pounds 66m), in
spite of a rise in profits before provisions to Pounds 1.18bn (Pounds
1.15bn). Profits at NatWest Markets, the investment banking subsidiary, fell
to Pounds 252m (Pounds 315m).
The bank made a retained loss of Pounds 103m after an unchanged final
dividend of 11.375p. Its ratio of capital to risk-adjusted assets rose to
9.8 per cent (9.6 per cent). Its tier one ratio weakened to 5.2 per cent
(5.5 per cent).
It took a Pounds 29m loss, and made a Pounds 93m adjustment to its capital
ratios as a result of a property revaluation. It did not apply a further
Pounds 175m fall in its property values to capital because it does not
consider this permanent.
Lord Alexander said the bank could accommodate a Pounds 17bn rise in
risk-weighted assets. A rights issue was unnecessary on anticipated asset
growth.
Earnings per share rose to 12p (3p). Shares closed 16p down at 443p.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Amstrad's return to profit surprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics company left limping by price wars in the
personal computer business, returned to the black in the half year to
December 31, 1992. It announced profits before tax of Pounds 5.61m compared
with a loss of Pounds 11.99m in the same period a year ago on essentially
flat sales of Pounds 195.55m (Pounds 196m).
Amstrad's first set of results since founder and chairman Mr Alan Sugar
failed in December last year to persuade shareholders to sell him back the
company at 30p a share, surprised and pleased analysts. They had expected
neither a positive result nor for the company to pay a dividend - albeit a
nominal 0.2p per ordinary share.
Some pointed out, however, that Mr Sugar was disingenuous during the
privatisation battle in declining to make a profits forecast when it must
have been clear by November that a good performance was on the cards.
Earnings per share were 0.7p compared with a loss of 1.3p last time. The
shares, which have been languishing about the 25p mark, rose to 29p on the
news.
Mr Sugar emphasised that the first six months were Amstrad's best sales
period and there was no guarantee that the company would be profitable or
pay a final dividend at the end of the year. He also said trading conditions
in the UK remain difficult and that Amstrad's products will have to be
re-engineered to meet selling prices which will generate volume sales.
The company's profitability was increased by sales of satellite equipment in
the UK and Germany and by interest payments of Pounds 3.75m derived from
Pounds 111.9m of cash. Amstrad's cash rose by Pounds 65m during the year.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Chairman warns against increased trade tensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Perry, Unilever chairman, expressed concern yesterday at the
recent rise in transatlantic tensions over trade and warned European
Community governments against allowing national self-interest to block
completion of the single market.
'Even if there may be a flicker of hope that economic growth might resume
sometime in 1993, we are increasingly worried by the unhelpful political
trends which are now all too evident,' he said. Mr Perry added that
resolution of the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
was long overdue.
Though Unilever, as a strong supporter of free trade, was disturbed by the
protectionist noises on both sides of the Atlantic, Mr Perry made clear that
he was particularly concerned by the attitude of the Clinton administration.
He singled out for criticism demands in the US to increase the tax burden on
the local operations of foreign companies, arguing that such discrimination
would damage the world economy. However, he said recent proposals appeared
less extreme than those floated during Mr Clinton's presidential campaign.

<TEXT>
THE INSURANCE Ombudsman yesterday called for new checks on insurance
salesmen after reporting a 41 per cent increase in the number of life
insurance cases he handled last year.
His comments come amid heated debate about standards of consumer protection
in the life insurance industry.
Mr Julian Farrand, who was presenting his annual report at a news conference
yesterday, said salesmen should be required to sign a form when selling a
life policy, which would give details of how much commission they would
receive and why they recommended the policy.
He said it was 'disconcerting' so many factfinds - forms filled in by
salesmen or advisers giving clients' financial circumstances - were not
fully completed: 'It suggests that in the push to produce a sale, important
requirements and needs may be overlooked and an unsuitable product selected
by the salesman.'
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, called on the government to ensure
proper protection for life insurance consumers: 'Self regulation has failed
to serve the consumer effectively. The industry must now be opened up to
proper scrutiny and more effective competition.'
Overall, the number of cases handled by the ombudsman, who deals with both
general and life insurance, increased by 29 per cent last year. The 1992
total of 5,576 cases represents a doubling of the workload since 1990 when
new claims were 2,640. Life insurance cases now account for over one third
of the Insurance Ombudsman's workload and are the most rapidly growing area.
In 65 per cent of all cases, the insurance company's decision was upheld,
said Mr Farrand.
He also criticised insurers for not doing enough to protect themselves
against fraudulent claims. 'They make a commercial decision to pay out,
rather than challenge the insured and suffer a difficult and costly
lawsuit.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / OFT may launch inquiry after 'improprieties' at copier group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE mounted yesterday on the Office of Fair Trading to launch an
investigation into the activities of 'cost-per-copy' photocopier companies
following the resignation of two executives and the dismissal of a sales
support team from Southern Business Group.
SBG, the publicly quoted photocopier supplier which has previously been
criticised for some of its contractual and accounting practices yesterday
confirmed that an internal investigation, started last August, had revealed
'a small number of improprieties' in its dealings with some customers.
Mr David McErlain, SBG managing director, said that the company - which
recorded 1992 pre-tax profits of Pounds 15.3m on a Pounds 54m turnover - had
'spent three years trying to build integrity in the marketplace'. It now had
'one big dent in it' because of justifiable criticism of some of its
activities.
Following the investigation and a board meeting on Monday, Mr Neil Redding,
managing director of SBG's Benworth subsidiary and a group board director,
and Mr Robert Dobereiner, a Benworth director, resigned. Mr McErlain
stressed that neither man had knowledge or involvement in the improprieties.
A London-based sales support team has also been sacked. Mr McErlaine said
the team employed unique techniques not in force elsewhere within the group.
He was satisfied that no further abuses would arise.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, last night called
on Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to invoke powers
under the 1988 Companies Act to investigate the company.
One of the contracts at the centre of SBG's internal investigation involved
the London borough of Tower Hamlets, which signed a Pounds 1.3m photocopier
contract with Benworth.
Last year, Mr Brian Pettitt, principal administration officer for the
council, wrote to SBG saying an audit revealed 'many discrepancies' relating
to accounts and agreements with Benworth and claimed misrepresentation.
Charing Cross Hospital in London has also sought legal advice over a
nine-year contract with Benworth.
The Campaign to Clean up Copier Contracts, which was formed last year after
complaints about high-pressure sales techniques and misrepresentation in the
photocopier market, yesterday called on the OFT to investigate all SBG
activities and the entire 'cost-per-copy' market.
A spokesman said it would warn existing customers of SBG and other
'cost-per-copy' users to check the documentation on their monthly usage of
photocopiers. Under 'cost-per-copy' contracts, the capital cost of
photocopying equipment is merged with the running costs. Customers guarantee
to pay for a minimum number of copies.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Europe may get 180 TV channels: Astra satellites using
digital signals could be in place within two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 180-channel satellite television system could be available over Europe by
1995 using the latest digital technology.
Societe Europeenne des Satellites, Luxembourg-based company that operates
the Astra satellite system, has decided to launch two satellites with
digital television capacity. This gives much improved picture quality and
enables a far greater number of signals to be transmitted.
Work has already begun on the satellites which could offer unprecedented
choice to European viewers.
Mr Celso Azevedo, technical director of SES said, at the Financial Times
Cable and Satellite conference in London yesterday, that the larger number
of channels would be achieved by compressing the digital signal.
Astra already operates two 16-channel satellites carrying everything from
Sky Television to Cable News Network and Eurosport. A third satellite is now
being completed and due to be launched this spring. The fourth and fifth
Astra satellites - one due to be launched next year and the other in 1995 -
will have the digital capacity.
The SES executive said there were also proposals not yet confirmed for a
sixth Astra satellite and the company might launch more satellites taking
the total number of channels to 360.
Apart from a modest expansion in the number of conventional television
channels that could be made available the main business opportunity in such
a large number of channels lies in charging for individual films.
As many as 50 or 60 channels can be devoted, for example, to showing the top
10 films. The transmission times of films would be staggered so that the
viewer would be no more than 20 minutes from a start of any film. Digital
television could also offer wide screen television pictures.
In the US Hughes Communications, part of the Hughes Aircraft Company, is
planning to launch a 150-channel system next year using digital compression
technology.
SES insisted yesterday that it was a myth that the arrival of digital
television was 10 years off and the next 24 months would be the testing
time.
Talks had already begun with microchip manufacturers and SES believes the
special decoders needed to receive the digital pictures could be available
by 1994.
SES emphasised yesterday that if digital television was going to be a
success there would have to be agreement on a single transmission standard.
It was also vital for there to be a common encryption system. The
encryption, or scrambling system, is an essential part of subscription
television. It makes the picture unwatchable for those who have not paid.
The picture is 'unlocked' by a smart card which looks like a credit card.
Mr Pierre Meyrat, the SES director general promised yesterday that it was
still not too late to develop an economically and technically efficient path
to digital television in Europe and a wide-screen television format, in
order to give the consumer a lot more choice.

FT  24 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Sedgwick
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sedgwick still looks like a company living beyond its means. The halved
dividend is covered less than 1.5 times and expenses grew faster than
revenue last year. At least the lower payout should stem the cash outflow of
the last four years. The company might also argue that expenses can only be
cut so far before business volume starts to suffer. But without a sharp
upturn in revenue growth, Sedgwick will have little room for manoeuvre. New
business initiatives and the drive for consulting income may help, but the
big gains will only come from a turn in US underwriting. That looks as
distant as ever.

FT  24 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: BPB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheek is often quietly admired, but BPB's chutzpah verges on the irritating.
Having tapped shareholders for Pounds 125m in June 1991, the company cut its
interim dividend last November - about as soon as it could without blushing
scarlet. At the time the board waived convention and refused to clarify its
intentions on the full year payment, settling instead for an upbeat trading
statement. Since then the shares have rallied by a third, a rise which made
possible yesterday's convertible bond issue on favourable terms. The
accompanying reduction in the full year dividend was, of course, in line
with the interim cut.
There is nothing technically wrong with this, but bruised shareholders may
feel that the BPB board has played the man rather than the ball. It is not
as though the profits outlook is sufficiently sparkling for shareholders to
assume the dividend will be on the way back up soon. BPB's competitor Knauf
still has 50 per cent of its UK capacity lying idle. Any uptick in the UK
housing market is unlikely to lead to higher prices, while continental
markets continue to deteriorate. Companies in such tight spots should,
perhaps, be a little less careless about shareholder sentiment.

FT  24 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: SmithKline Beecham
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With one fifth of its profits coming from consumer brands such as Ribena and
Horlicks, SmithKline Beecham was always likely to fare better than pure
pharmaceuticals companies when the market turned. Having roundly
outperformed Glaxo over the last year, the rating difference between the two
stocks no longer looks such an anomaly. Last year's performance in
pharmaceuticals was at least as impressive as its rival. While Glaxo is
agonising over a strategy for over-the-counter medicines, SB already has the
pieces in place, thanks, not least, to its alliance with Marion Merrell Dow.
Since the US patent of Tagamet, its big selling anti-ulcer drug, expires in
May next year the company has good reason to explore new avenues. A strategy
for OTC medicines by no means guarantees future earnings growth. The US
authorities may never allow anti-ulcer drugs like Tagamet or Glaxo's Zantac
to be sold without a prescription. Regardless of President Clinton's
initiative on healthcare, though, the pressure on prices in prescription
pharmaceuticals looks like getting worse. In that case SB's consumer brands
business no longer looks a dead weight.

FT  24 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fashionable view suggests Unilever's shares will languish as investors
continue to switch from reliable defensive stocks into more volatile
recovery plays. Judging by yesterday's annual results, it would not do to
despair too soon.
A particularly strong fourth quarter lifted Unilever's annual pre-tax
profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 2.03bn. Good financial housekeeping enabled
the company to contain costs, drive down debt by one-fifth to Pounds 1.2bn,
and cut its interest bill from Pounds 276m to Pounds 148m. But additional
sales growth was spurred by a 15 per cent increase in advertising and
promotional spending. Twenty two acquisitions, at a cost of some Pounds
300m, boosted Unilever's drive into overseas markets. This expansionary
momentum should accelerate despite softening markets in mainland Europe.
With year-end gearing of just 18 per cent, Unilever can afford to pep up its
prospects with sizeable acquisitions.
Unilever's earnings growth may trail the expected market average this year.
Yet, on most projections, the company is trading on a sub-market rating. Its
shares may therefore prove a good hedge should the UK upturn prove as
anaemic as the company suspects it will be. Longer term, Unilever offers
visibly good growth prospects although the concentration of European retail
power threatens to squeeze its margins. But even here, Unilever's renewed
emphasis on brand innovation suggests a determination to defend itself.

FT  24 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: NatWest's capital risk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster claims plenty of reasons for feeling comfortable with a
tier one capital ratio of only 5.2 per cent. The list is so elaborate that
the bank must have given considerable thought to the question of whether it
was comfortable in the first place. All the more so since the ratio would be
closer to 5 per cent if, unlike Lloyds, it had fully adjusted its capital
for lower property values. NatWest could just about get away even with that
lower number. But it is close enough to the Bank of England's effective
minimum for tier one to raise doubts about its ability to finance higher
lending in a recovery.
If necessary, the bank could convert some of last year's sterling bond issue
into preference shares. It could issue more such bonds. Or it could switch
some of its surplus money market deposits to customer lending. But these
adjustments would help only at the margin. NatWest's real gamble is that
loan growth will not take off before a reduction in provisions has enabled
it to rebuild its capital through retained earnings.
That looks a tall order when someone somewhere will have to put money into
the property market to reflate the depressed prices which caused the
provisions in the first place. If property prices stabilise, NatWest will at
least no longer have to top up old provisions. That will help, but one has
to make some optimistic assumptions to pencil in retentions much over Pounds
200m for 1993. NatWest is thus walking a tightrope on capital. Having set an
uncovered dividend for each of the past four years, it will only have itself
to blame if it eventually falls off.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Landed interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MARGINAL voters in London and the south-east, the leasehold
enfranchisement proposals now contained in the housing and urban development
bill were one of the more tempting morsels in the Tories' shop window at the
last election. But as the rumblings that preceded yesterday's second reading
in the Lords demonstrated once again, this opportunistic assault on property
rights sticks in many a Tory gullet. Though hedged about with
qualifications, the leaseholder's proposed right to buy looks to the landed
interest like a clear case of the government failing to uphold contracts
freely entered into.
Yet the argument about property rights was lost long ago when the 1967
Leasehold Reform Act first enfranchised many homeowners. When the Duke of
Westminster subsequently took his case against the legislation to the
European Court of Human Rights, he was told that the compulsory transfer of
property from one individual to another 'might constitute a legitimate means
of promoting the public interest'; and that 'the enhancement of social
justice within the Community could properly be described as being in the
public interest'.
Since the government's chief aim in the present bill is to extend home
ownership, that principle can be evoked here with equal plausibility. It is
simply a case of unfinished business. The real question is whether the
outcome is likely to be economically efficient and whether the terms of the
transfer are just.
At present the management of much of Britain's leasehold residential
property stock is anything but efficient. Even at the top end of the market
there is no shortage of bad landlords. The leasehold system has tended to
grant full control to the landlord without imposing commensurate
responsibility. Part of the case for home ownership is precisely that owner
occupiers are more actively committed to the proper upkeep of the housing
stock. And in the present instance, there is the further benefit that
enfranchisement will allow many hitherto unmortgageable leasehold properties
to attract conventional mortgage funds, adding flexibility to the housing
market.
The issue of justice is more complex. The enhanced value arising from
enfranchisement is to be shared equally between landlord and leaseholder.
That suggests that the landlord is the loser. But in practice the
leaseholder faces big uncertainties and costs in the enfranchisement
process. The verdict at this stage must be open.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Butterflies before the first date: Major's meeting with
Clinton matters far more to the UK leader than the US president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been impossible to miss the apprehension in John Major's entourage as
he prepares for his first visit this afternoon to Bill Clinton's White
House.
The anxiety is understandable. The UK and US leaders have never met. They
confront a formidable array of issues.
President Clinton's latest salvo against subsidies for the European Airbus
consortium has provided an awkward reminder of the trade disputes souring
transatlantic relations. The Gatt world trade talks have stalled. Washington
is retaliating against what it judges to be unfair support for European
steel companies. Other trade rows loom on the horizon.
Britain is further discomfited by the moral dimension that President Clinton
promises to inject into US relations with the rest of the world. Visible
already in his approach to Bosnia and China, this has added a fresh
uncertainty to the world disorder that has followed the end of the cold war.
The administration's decision to back the peace efforts of Lord Owen and Mr
Cyrus Vance in Bosnia has removed some of the initial transatlantic friction
over its approach to the crisis in the former Yugoslav province. But there
are still doubts about how it will respond as events continue to unfold.
Further afield, the US moral tone is viewed as a threat to the prosperity of
Hong Kong during the critical period before the colony's transfer to
Beijing. A decision by the new administration to revoke China's Most
Favoured Nation trading status on human rights grounds would jeopardise 15
per cent of Hong Kong's exports.
Then there is the awkwardness caused by President Clinton's decision to send
an emissary to Northern Ireland. It is a problem that can, and almost
certainly will be, smoothed over, but a nuisance nonetheless.
There are more fundamental strategic concerns for the UK. Washington plans
to scale down to 100,000 troops its commitment to European defence: this is
judged in London not to threaten the US's pivotal role in Nato. But Mr Major
fears that, if Washington were to go much below that figure, it would
seriously threaten the alliance that has kept the peace in Europe for 40
years.
The underlying question concerns how the US sees its place in the world  -
whether it decides to look westwards to the Pacific for its future, rather
than eastwards to Europe - more than bilateral relations with Britain. But
historical associations mean that the uncertainty about the new
administration's response to that question is felt most acutely in London.
So it is an important meeting: but much more so for Mr Major than for Mr
Clinton. Politically on the defensive at home, the UK prime minister has to
demonstrate that he remains a force on the world stage. To do that he must
be seen to get on with the first Democrat in the White House for 12 years.
Mr Clinton, taking a few hours off from selling the bold domestic programme
which he set out last week in his state of the union address, has nothing to
prove to his British cousins.
For weeks now, UK officials and ministers have been explaining why the
encounter will go well: the special relationship, a concept still prized in
London if rarely mentioned in Washington, will be reaffirmed. Their
arguments go something like this:
The two men are both 40-something, representatives of the new generation of
world leaders for the 1990s. They will be around long after President
Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl have left to write their
memoirs.
The president, it must be admitted, is a Democrat. But if you discount the
labels, that does not leave him far removed on the political spectrum from
Mr Major's brand of conservatism. And if a couple of Tory henchmen helped
the former president, George Bush, in the US election campaign, nobody told
the prime minister.
Sometimes the claims made for the forthcoming meeting are amusingly
extravagant. The two men, it is said solemnly, will find common cause in
their similarly humble backgrounds. No one bothers to fill in the detail of
the shared boyhood experiences of the Rhodes scholar from Arkansas and the
self-made politician from Brixton.
But there are also more substantial points. It is suggested that one of Mr
Clinton's first acts was probably to draw up a list of the foreign policy
issues that could distract him from the priorities of his domestic agenda.
Beside each, he will have noted the position of each of his main partners. A
glance down the list will have confirmed that Britain appears most
frequently next to the US, as its most consistently dependable ally.
And the cold-war habit of close co-operation on military, intelligence and
security questions has been reinforced by joint action against Iraq.
The arguments add up to a reasonable pitch; and one that US diplomats in
London have been happy to substantiate. Mr Raymond Seitz, the Anglophile US
ambassador, has been bustling around Whitehall, confirming the symbolic
significance of Mr Clinton's decision to put Mr Major near the top of his
list of visiting world leaders. The Japanese must be furious.
Mr Major's problem is that the intensity with which the pitch is made
betrays the underlying apprehension. His officials are right on one level,
wrong on another.
He should get on well personally with the new president. He has a talent for
making friends of old enemies - witness the bridges he built with Chancellor
Kohl after Lady Thatcher's departure. There is no percentage for Mr Clinton
in being anything but gracious to his guest.
But the easy friendship and shared certainties that flowed from the
coincidence of 12 years of Republican presidents and Conservative prime
ministers will be impossible to recapture. With the ending of the cold war,
Britain has less to offer. Mr Clinton has different preoccupations.
The economic revival that buttressed Lady Thatcher's claim to a prominent
role on the world stage has dissolved into grim recession. In crude
political terms, Mr Major at present is weaker than any British leader since
the 1970s.
With a Democratic Congress behind him, Mr Clinton is as strong as any recent
president starting a first term; and he has pinned the future of his
presidency on the success of a domestic rather than an international agenda.
So the astute minds in Whitehall have already adjusted their assessment of
the relationship. Certainly Mr Major should be seen to get on with President
Clinton. But the prime minister must emphasise an uncommon coincidence of
interest between the two countries rather than press any claims for special
privileges.
Here Mr Major moves on to much firmer territory.
He can offer no easy solutions to the trade problems threatening EC-US
relations. But he can project London as Washington's staunchest ally in
opposition to a fortress Europe, the honest broker between Washington and
Brussels.
No other member of the European Community is as unashamedly in favour of
free trade. Few others are as committed as Mr Major to the EC's enlargement,
to include first the Nordic countries and later the new democracies in
eastern Europe. The unspoken question at the White House this afternoon will
be: would President Clinton prefer France to set the tone for transatlantic
relations?
There is common ground across a broad swathe of foreign policy
preoccupations. Mr Major proved in the final days of the Bush
administration, in the confrontation with Saddam Hussein of Iraq, that
Britain is as reliable an ally as a US president can expect. The same offer
will be open to President Clinton.
London may seem reluctant to join Washington on the moral high ground in its
approach to the Bosnian crisis. But on a practical level Mr Major will offer
firm support for Washington's determination to tighten the screw on Serbia
and its leaders. He has kept to himself the serious doubts in Whitehall
about the US plan to air-drop supplies to Bosnian communities.
It is on the practice of co-operation that Mr Major is basing his hopes of
establishing a rapport with President Clinton. But, if he is wise, he will
allow talk of the special relationship to drift quietly into the history
books.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Personal View: A provincial lesson for Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BORIS NEMTSOV

<TEXT>
There is a danger that the recent changes in the Russian federal government
may divert attention from the progress being achieved in the provinces. This
may hinder western businesses' understanding of how to gain a foothold, in
regions where western assistance is already playing a useful role in the
implementation of reform.
As the governor of the Nizhny Novgorod province and a deputy to the Russian
congress, I participate in government at the local and national level. I
therefore have the benefit of both perspectives. Political uncertainty in
the centre has stood in sharp contrast to the continuity in the provinces,
where reforms will continue to be implemented despite Mr Victor Chernomyrdin
having replaced Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime minister of the federal government.
Nizhny Novgorod province, which has a population of 3.7m and is home to the
third-largest city in Russia, provides a significant case study of reform
and the constructive role the west can play in it. Once known as the 'pocket
book of Russia' because of its trading wealth, Nizhny Novgorod more recently
gained fame as Gorky, the closed city that was the home-in-exile of Andrei
Sakharov.
Restored to its original name and opened to foreigners for the first time
since Stalin's rule, Nizhny Novgorod is benefiting greatly from foreign
assistance, including technical assistance from the International Finance
Corporation, conversion assistance from the International Executive Service
Corps, and education and training for our residents from the US Peace Corps
and the University City Science Centre of Philadelphia.
Technical assistance has enabled Nizhny Novgorod to make progress toward
establishing a market economy. When our province decided to implement the
first privatisation of small-scale enterprises, including shops and small
service establishments, we began our work with IFC. This co-operation has
embraced new programmes designed to deepen privatisation, including
restructuring our truck transport industry (financed by the US and the UK)
and privatisation of collective farms. Not only has our province benefited
from exceptionally rapid and well co-ordinated privatisation, it has also
served as a model to other Russian provinces.
We embarked on the first privatisation programme in Russia in March 1992,
developing the auction method of privatisation now being used throughout
Russia. A framework for privatising retail establishments had been in place
for months on the national level, but only when we took the initiative was
the programme implemented.
We then began to privatise trucking enterprises and individual trucks. The
truck auctions involved the first use of privatisation vouchers in Russia
and, again, Nizhny Novgorod's programme is being used as the basis for
similar privatisation in other provinces.
While technical assistance must be targeted at important sectors to make
efficient use of limited aid resources, it has helped us to push
privatisation forward along a broad front. Our provincial privatisation
agencies, emboldened by a string of successes, have embarked on ambitious
programmes of their own. They have launched sectoral programmes for our
wholesale trade network, construction industry and food processing plants.
We are currently putting a programme in place to privatise agricultural
land, once again with US financing and IFC expertise. Although the number of
private farms established to date is insignificant, I am confident that we
will develop a model that will help thousands of collective farms locally
and throughout Russia to reorganise on the basic of private land ownership.
The main barrier to reforms has not been a lack of legislation, but
difficulty in implementing them at provincial level. Experience gained in
Nizhny Novgorod has made a significant contribution by showing how the law
should be applied and, in many instances, by demonstrating that
privatisation can work and will have a positive impact.
Barring a radical reversal of policy, including the repeal of dozens of
Supreme Soviet laws and presidential decrees, central government will have
little effect on the pace of our privatisation programmes or those of other
provinces.
The new Russia is the sum of its provinces in a way the Soviet Union never
was. People who want to assist us in our process of change would do well to
look beyond the capital. The impact of privatisation assistance to our
province to date cannot be overestimated, and our experience has had a big
impact on Russia as a whole.
The author is governor of Nizhny Novgorod province and deputy to the Russian
Federation Congress

FT  24 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Mr Bentsen's loose talk
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OFF-THE-CUFF quips may be powerful weapons in the heat of campaign politics,
as US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen memorably demonstrated in the 1988
vice-presidential debate with Mr Dan Quayle. But in the world of
international finance they should be avoided. Mr Bentsen's offhand remark to
journalists last week that he wanted to see a stronger yen exchange rate
against the dollar may not have been intended to signal a shift in US policy
towards managed exchange rates. But it sent the dollar crashing all the
same, and will have won Mr Bentsen few friends in Tokyo.
Mr Bentsen's remarks, if unintentional, were certainly insensitive. By
appearing to associate the US administration with proposals for a 20 per
cent yen revaluation, currently being touted by Mr Fred Bergsten, assistant
Treasury secretary in the Carter administration, Mr Bentsen has not helped
his efforts to revitalise co-operation between the Group of Seven industrial
countries at this weekend's meeting in London.
Not that a rise in the value of the yen is necessarily undesirable.
Regrettably, Japan's record bilateral surplus with the US is an embarrassing
political problem for President Clinton. A gradual appreciation of the yen
is a better solution than the protectionist trade policies that elements in
the US Democratic party would prefer, however painful for some of Japan's
manufacturers.
Yet the prospect of a return to 1980s-style exchange rate management sends
chills down the spines of Japanese government officials. For policy
co-ordination over the past decade, by concentrating on tinkering with
exchange rates while ignoring the fiscal causes of trade imbalances, did
more harm than good. The loose monetary policy that US Treasury secretary
James Baker persuaded Japan to pursue after 1985 is largely to blame for
Tokyo's stock market bubble and subsequent recession. Nor does a rise in
Japanese interest rates, to force up the yen, make any more sense today, a
fact that US officials understand. Only one senior US Treasury official has
a name beginning with 'B' and ending with 'n', last week's Japanese
delegation to Washington was reportedly informed.
Mr Bentsen's remarks are bound to divert attention from his case for more
growth-friendly policies in other G7 countries. The Bush administration's
repeated calls for concerted action to speed growth always sounded hollow
while the US budget deficit remained large and long-term interest rates
high. But the Clinton team can now point to last week's deficit-reducing
package as a tangible attempt to rebalance the US economy, and the  1/2
point fall in long-term interest rates since the election as evidence of how
fiscal rebalancing might work.
Now it is Europe's turn. Germany's dangerously unbalanced fiscal and
monetary policy is imposing high interest rates, slow growth and rising
budget deficits across Europe. A German package of tax increases and
spending cuts is the best way to reduce high European real interest rates.
Tokyo, meanwhile, can and should be cajoled into exploiting its healthy
fiscal surplus in order to revive the currently depressed state of Japanese
domestic demand, the main reason for Japan's rising trade surplus.
A further Japanese fiscal package, signalled yesterday and possibly an
element in a G7 initiative to revive the world economy, is the best way for
Tokyo and the Clinton administration to stall the US protectionist lobby. A
by-product of such a package is likely to be a further appreciation of the
yen against the D-Mark bloc currencies, and possibly against the dollar too.
But the world economy will be a safer place if exchange rate movements occur
as a consequence of sensible domestic policies, not instead of them. Lloyd
Bentsen, it must be hoped, is in this respect no James Baker.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not hard to see who were the real winners in this week's Hong Kong stock
market debut of Denway Investments, the China 'concept' stock which was 657
times oversubscribed.
Denway itself ought to have made HKDollars 120m-HKDollars 150m simply from
the interest on owning the over-subscription funds for a week. Not bad,
given that it only forecast HKDollars 129m net profit for 1992.
Denway's main adviser, Peregrine, should have done nearly as well. As part
of the underwriting deal, it got to keep 3 per cent of the issue, which
could mean it will double the near HKDollars 50m in fees it has earned.

Sprechen Sie Deutsch? That is a question Jacques Calvet - Peugeot chairman,
Japan-basher extraordinaire, Maastricht opponent, etc, etc - prefers
officials from the Bank of France, at least, to answer in the negative.
He has two current bugbears. One is the Bundesbank's insularity in refusing
to slash interest rates. The other is French cross-party support for an
independent central bank which he sees as 'the French humbling themselves in
front of the Germans once more'.
Hence Calvet, who's after all trying to sell cars in notably inclement
conditions, was yesterday muttering that the next step would no doubt be a
requirement that his country's central bank staff parlez allemand.
Not that devaluation isn't the same thing in any language.

With Sir Michael Angus now toiling at BA and the CBI, who will make a song
and dance at Unilever? Not, it seems, Mike Perry, his successor as chairman,
who refuses to follow Angus's tradition of enlivening press conferences with
an impromptu limerick or ditty.
A marketing man by background, Perry chose instead to use the occasion to
promote the company's wares, producing a succession of new products out of a
tatty cardboard box and lining them up on the rostrum. According to his
colleagues, it wasn't just an act for the cameras; he's been known to do the
same at board meetings.

Could it be that the lack of competition in today's Cuban election is
designed to keep the streets clean? According to Fidel Castro, sparse
resources are not being squandered on littering streets with election
literature and dissenting candidates.
The island's first election since the 1959 revolution will be 'the purest in
the world', he says. It is not going to be an exercise in 'cheap politics
and demagogy . . . which you see today in a large part of the world'.

asked O'Reilly to have a word with Digital's chief executive, Robert Palmer.
What will O'Reilly have to offer that wasn't already offered by Ruari Quinn,

FT  24 FEB 93 / Observer: Pyramid victory
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Don't cross Peter Munk. After 15 years pursuing Egypt through the courts,
the hotelier turned gold-bug has again come out on top. The country is
paying him Dollars 17.5m to settle a long-running row.
He is best known these days for his Canadian gold and oil property
businesses encompassing American Barrick Resources, one of the biggest gold
producers, and Horsham. But back in 1974 he led a group of investors in
Southern Pacific Properties, which launched the first big development
project in Egypt in line with President Sadat's 'open door' policy for
western investment there.
In a joint venture with the Egyptian ministry of tourism, SPP was to develop
hotels and tourist resorts near the pyramids, and at Ras el Hekma on the
Mediterranean coast. The project angered Islamic fundamentalists; it was
defiling the pyramids and insulting ancient Egyptian civilisation, they
said. Sadat caved in, the government pulled out and the scheme collapsed.
Munk has been seeking compensation for SPP ever since. He won his first
court case at the International Chamber of Commerce Tribunal in Paris 10
years ago, when Egypt was ordered to pay Dollars 12.5m plus interest. Its
government appealed, and did so again even after the International Centre
for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington awarded Munk Dollars
27.6m. But now the parties have agreed a settlement.
Although often told he was flogging a dead camel, multi-millionaire Munk
pressed on. The same tenacity has been felt by UK stockbrokers James Capel,
which in 1989 incensed him by buying shares in Consolidated Gold Fields on
its own account after being instructed to build a stake in Gold Fields for
American Barrick.
Two years later, without admitting liability, Capel settled out of court for
about Pounds 2m.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Funding the UN
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past western governments had some excuse for thinking of the UN as an
expensive talking shop of limited use, which had to be kept on a tight
financial rein. But in the last two or three years those very governments,
through the Security Council, have loaded the organisation with a succession
of exacting tasks, especially in the field of peacekeeping.
It was therefore quite a shrewd move on the part of the secretary-general,
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, to encourage the Ford Foundation to set up a
high-level independent advisory group on UN financing, co-chaired by Mr Paul
Volcker with Mr Shijuro Ogata, the respected former deputy governor of the
Japan Development Bank, and including such impeccably orthodox financial
luminaries as Raymond Barre, Pehr Gyllenhammar, Karl Otto Pohl and Sir David
Scholey.
It may not be an original observation, but it is still a remarkable one,
that the UN spent less on peacekeeping in 1992 than the cost of one stealth
bomber, or of operating the New York City Police Department for one year.
Perhaps in itself such frugality is a matter for congratulation, but the
effects of parsimony, and more especially of the hand-to-mouth way the money
is raised, are increasingly and unpleasantly visible in the time it takes
the secretariat to respond when instructed to provide peacekeeping forces,
and sometimes in the mishandling of peacekeeping tasks when the forces do
arrive.
The group rejects the suggestions that the UN be given authority to borrow,
but accepts such ideas as charging interest on contributions in arrears and
allowing the secretary-general to commit a proportion of the funds for a
peacekeeping operation as soon as the Security Council has approved it. It
also advocates the creation of a revolving reserve fund for peacekeeping set
at Dollars 400m (much larger than the Dollars 50m Mr Boutros Ghali had
suggested), recommends a regular appropriation for peacekeeping training,
and urges the UN to consider the merits of a unified peacekeeping budget, in
place of the separate budgets currently in use for each operation. And it
lends its considerable authority to the notion that, since peacekeeping is
'an investment in security', governments should finance it from their
national defence budgets.
The report should be taken seriously, not least by the two countries which
have invested most (politically if not financially) in the UN's new role,
and whose leaders are meeting each other for the first time today.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Letter: Cottoned on to Benetton pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JACK O'NEILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In Haig Simonian's article on Benetton (International Company News,
February 17) he quotes Mr Luciano Benetton as saying '. . . important raw
materials, such as wool and cotton, have not gone up in price in spite of
the lira's fall'.
One year ago the price of cotton (Cotton Outlook A Index) was 55.60
cents/lb; currently it is 61.95 cents/lb. The lira-US dollar exchange rate a
year ago was L1,218, today it is L1,560. This makes the cost of 1lb of
cotton L677 a year ago and L960 now; a rise of 42 per cent.
The fall of the lira against the dollar commenced in September 1992 and
cotton prices started to rise towards the end of 1992. Certainly it will
take time for the full amount of the increase to work through manufacturing
costs, because of futures, US dollar covering and inventories. It will be
impossible to ask an already shattered cotton textile industry to absorb
such an increase. Unless, of course, Mr Benetton would like to see the
industry stripped naked too.

FT  24 FEB 93 / The incredible shrinking market: Cost-cutting and gloomy
forecasts of losses are taking their toll at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The florists round here are in for a rough time. There'll be no more ornate
dinners with banks of flowers,' says Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of
Lloyd's of London, as he bluntly reports a further round of cuts.
The savings at the corporation of Lloyd's, the 'civil service' that
regulates and services the troubled insurance market, are part of a
wide-ranging management shake-out. In the seven weeks since Mr David
Rowland, the new chairman, joined Mr Middleton in the suite of executive
offices at the top of the Lloyd's building, the pace has quickened. Over the
past six months, Mr Middleton has sliced nearly Pounds 30m off a Pounds 145m
annual budget, cut 300 of 2,200 jobs and promised the loss of 300 more.
Chauffeurs, administrators and information technologists have been
dismissed, and the corporation's 15 management layers scythed down to six.
'It is going to be a year of quite profound change,' promises Mr Middleton.
Now that many support jobs have been removed, Mr Middleton and Mr Rowland
are turning their attention to the more than 200 businesses which make up
the market. Advised by a 'market board' of leading underwriters and brokers,
as well as outside businessmen, Mr Middleton is preparing the first
'business plan' in Lloyd's 306-year history.
Under consideration are several radical reforms, including potentially
far-reaching changes to the agency system, which links the Names - the
individuals who provide the market's capital - with the underwriters who use
it.
Members' agencies - which handle the affairs of Names and allocate them to
syndicates - could be stripped of many administrative and financial
functions. This could force many smaller and less productive ones out of
business and add to the rationalisation which has seen the disappearance of
some 170 of the 401 syndicates active in 1990.
Mr Middleton is keen to bring a degree of centralisation to the fragmented
market. 'The outside world sees it as a single brand name,' he adds, warning
that Lloyd's is condemned to 'dwindle into insignificance' if it fails to
improve its competitiveness in international markets for specialist
commercial insurance and reinsurance.
Despite the energy and drive of the new leadership team, its task has
recently begun to appear more daunting. Optimism among underwriters and
agents, fuelled by increases in insurance rates and the promise of a return
to profitability in 1993, has been dented as the scale of the problems
becomes apparent.
The 1990 year of account, which Lloyd's will report in June in line with its
three-year accounting system, looks set to produce heavier-than-expected
losses. Just a year ago Lloyd's characterised estimates that the 1990 loss
might reach Pounds 1bn as 'alarmist' and unduly pessimistic. It now appears
that losses for the year will be at least Pounds 1.6bn and could equal
1989's record loss of Pounds 2.06bn.
The chairman of one of the largest agencies says that the escalation of
projected market losses for 1990 is worse than anticipated even as recently
as December. 'I don't think anybody in the market expected 1990 to be a
colossal loss.'
There are two main reasons. First, reports from a number of syndicates
suggest that the worst of the claims from so-called 'spiral' reinsurance, in
which syndicates and companies reinsure each other's catastrophe losses,
have not yet materialised. This has deepened the gloom of many at the
market, especially those working Names whose syndicates were left relatively
unscathed last year but who now face heavy personal losses. The scale and
unexpectedness of the losses of one syndicate led one veteran underwriter,
Mr Roy Bromley, to commit suicide at the end of last month.
Second, there are few signs of a reduction in the level of claims from
asbestosis and pollution in the United States, where potential liabilities
on old policies sometimes written more than 30 years ago could undermine the
market. Syndicates have reserved more than Pounds 2bn against such losses.
Last week it emerged that Syndicate Underwriting Management, which handles
the claims against more than 80 syndicates that have gone out of business,
was last year notified of a 30 per cent increase in possible claims arising
from US pollution cases.
While the trend of judgments in US court cases over who should pay the cost
of environmental clean-ups ordered by the federal government has not been
clear-cut, underwriters nevertheless feel vulnerable. 'Some professionals
think that pollution is the end of the world as we know it,' says one
leading underwriter.
Other factors have played a part in eroding the market's confidence. Lloyd's
is bracing for another round of bad publicity over litigation between Names
and their agents. Several thousand of the more than 30,000 Names who have
underwritten at Lloyd's in the past five years are involved in some form of
legal action. Two of the largest cases - those involving the Feltrim and
Gooda Walker syndicates - are set to come to court over the next two years.
Efforts to reach a global settlement of all outstanding cases are under way
but so far no proposals have emerged.
The decline of the market's capital base is also prompting concern. The
scale of recent losses has forced many Names out of the market and caused
others to reduce their commitments. This year capacity (the amount available
to back insurance premiums) is expected to shrink by at least Pounds 1.5bn
(see chart). Another fall is forecast next year, with some observers
expecting capacity to drop to less than Pounds 7bn.
Already there are indications that Lloyd's is losing some business to
financially strong European insurers and reinsurers. Mr Jeff Fieldson,
vice-president of Johnson &amp; Higgins, the US broker which places business for
many of the world's biggest companies, says groups like his still work
through Lloyd's but increasingly turn to insurers in Paris, Munich, Trieste
and Zurich to complete big deals.
Mr Middleton and Mr Rowland have responded to these problems with a
two-pronged programme of cost-cutting and raising new capital. Swingeing job
cuts are already well under way but efforts to attract capital are only just
beginning.
Such a course of action was recommended by a market task force chaired by Mr
Rowland last year. His report proposed capacity of at least Pounds 13bn by
1997, a goal which, on present trends, Lloyd's is far from achieving.
Institutional investors and insurance companies as well as wealthier Names
will be targeted.
However, the uncertainty stemming from the market's exposure to asbestosis
and pollution claims is a significant block to new entrants. This legacy
from the past is beginning to emerge as the single most important constraint
to recovery, while efforts to resolve it highlight the potential clash
between present and future investors.
A growing number of market professionals wants to 'fence off' old
liabilities by leaving syndicate accounts for 1990 open. This would mean
that responsibility for losses arising in 1990 would have to be met by only
those Names who were members of Lloyd's in that year. New Names would be
exempt. Last year Lloyd's made it easier for agents to leave syndicates'
accounts open and, as a result, the number of syndicates with open years
doubled to more than 100. This week, however, the market appears to have
ruled out the idea of forcing syndicates to keep 1990 open.
This is unlikely to stop the practice despite its 'harsh' effect 'on Names
who have stuck with us through thick and thin', says one agent. But it is a
sacrifice they may be called upon to pay if Lloyd's is to surmount its
present crisis.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Letter: Commission has wrong priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYAN CASSIDY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, lain Vallance makes justified criticisms of the European Commission's
gingerly approach to telecommunications liberalisation (Personal View,
February 18).
Indeed, the situation is more alarming than even he indicates. Here is
paragraph 18 of the European Commission's recently published work programme
for 1993:
'The Commission's proposals concerning telecommunications will be designed
to establish for a period of 8 to 10 years a stable framework, approved by
all interested parties (regulatory authorities, network operators, service
suppliers and users), laying down the various measures to be introduced
gradually to promote the establishment of advanced trans-European networks.
The guidelines for satellite and mobile telecommunications will continue to
be applied. There will be no let-up in the Commission's endeavours to
facilitate the introduction of high definition television in Europe.'
It would be hard to think of a better example of diametrically wrong
priorities. The EC needs to speed up work on trans-European
telecommunications networks while slowing down on the misconceived high
definition television programme.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Letter: Business Expansion Scheme will bail out building
societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From B C ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I refer to John Gapper's article 'Back from the brink of despair'
(February 17). It is not the very large drop in interest rates which is
going to bail out the building societies movement. The release of
repossessed properties from the non-performing loan book into Business
Expansion Schemes will be the significant factor.
The government is allowing higher-rate taxpayers 40 per cent relief to put
money into Business Expansion Schemes which will defer for five years the
impact of the iceberg while only tying up the investors' capital for six
months.
Notwithstanding lower interest rates and Business Expansion Schemes, the
building society movement still has to address the fact that transactions
have fallen by more than 50 per cent and the present high numbers of staff
cannot be supported indefinitely unless the number of transactions is
increased significantly towards levels previously attained.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Letter: Coming to the defence of gilts for pension funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL HAINES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Plender ('Time to tilt the balance', February 9) is right to
highlight the debate between equities and gilts for pension funds. Many
pension funds are significantly more mature than 20 years ago and need a
higher gilt exposure than is suggested by the typical fund. Furthermore, Mr
Plender is right that fund managers as a group will change the asset
distribution very slowly, paying more attention to what their competitors
are doing rather than a fundamental assessment of the comparative values of
different asset classes: a strong case for funds looking at their strategies
on an individual basis.
However, the case that Mr Plender seeks to build for gilts over equities
seems to be a classic case of the smear campaign: if we throw enough mud at
equities, some will stick.
There are a number of points I would like to challenge.
The article claims that falling dividend yields are bad news for pension
funds as actuaries value equities on the basis of their income stream rather
than their market value. This is indeed the generally accepted valuation
procedure, but it is not affected by the dividend yield per se: the level of
dividend is obtained by multiplying market value by dividend yield and a
decline in one caused by an increase in the other is irrelevant.
Real dividend growth may well have been negative from 1962 to 1982 but in
this period equities returned 12.7 per cent a year against a cost of living
increase of 9.5 per cent and a return on fixed interest stocks of 7.5 per
cent a year.
In reviewing the likely returns from equities, the article quotes 3 per cent
a year as the 'century in/century out real return on risk-free bonds'. Where
does this come from? There has been no 30-year period since 1945 when UK
fixed interest stocks provided a real return of 3 per cent a year.
Furthermore, there has been no 10-year period since 1945 when fixed interest
has out-performed equities - not even the 10 years ending December 31 1974.
There may well be a case for pension funds favouring gilts over equities,
but it needs to be made on a clearer basis than a selective historical
analysis and a misrepresentation of actuarial techniques.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Letter: Prompt release of information the best counter to
leaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J L T DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Surely the obvious way to combat leaks of official statistics ('CSO
combats leaks of official statistics', February 20) is for the Central
Statistical Office to release this information as soon as it is available.
There really is very little point in companies and organisations
endeavouring to make prompt statistical returns if ministers then sit upon
the results. This type of statistical information is not just price
sensitive, but is used in a whole variety of important applications within
industry, and the sooner it is made available the more useful it is.
The situation with regard to the retail price index is, of course,
particularly scandalous. First, the latest information is withheld from the
public for nearly two weeks after becoming available and, second, this is a
statistic which, if derived from the electronic databases of a
representative sample of leading retailers, could in fact become almost a
real-time item of data similar to the FT index. Instead, I understand that
much of the information used is still collected by investigators visiting
stores and noting down prices.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Foreign Affairs: Vote to break the bosses - Italy needs an
Irish, not UK, electoral system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few countries are wholly satisfied with their electoral system. In Britain
many people are acutely frustrated by the unfairness of a system in which
most voters have no chance of influencing the result one way or the other,
and many live all their lives without being represented by either the party
or the individual of their choice. Even the Labour party, which
traditionally has favoured the system, seems now to be coming round to the
idea of reform after losing four general elections in a row.
Yet in Italy there is even greater frustration at the effects of the party
list system, where voters choose between lists of candidates drawn up by
political parties. This ensures proportional representation (PR) for the
parties but is also blamed for the immobility and corruption of Italian
politics. The British system is envied in Italy because it gives voters the
chance to choose between alternative governments.
The problem is, of course, that in a parliamentary democracy parliament has
two functions - to represent the different strands of public opinion and to
provide effective government - which are not easily compatible. PR achieves
the former, but sometimes at the expense of the latter - a good reason,
perhaps, for opposing it as a method of choosing national parliaments, but
hardly applicable to the European Parliament, unless or until it is proposed
to make Europe a parliamentary democracy, with a federal government
responsible to a federal assembly.
In Israel, which at present has an even purer version of the party list
system than Italy, with somewhat similar results, a law has been passed
providing for the next prime minister to be elected directly by the people.
Israelis do not seem to have realised it yet, but the effect will be to turn
Israel from a parliamentary democracy into either a presidential one like
the US (welcome to gridlock) or a semi-presidential one like France (welcome
to co-habitation).
Italian reformers, less radical, are campaigning for a mixed electoral
system. Although they would like a majority of MPs to be elected in
single-member constituencies (with either one or two ballots), they want to
keep the party list system for a minority - either one third or 40 per cent
 -to give a somewhat more proportional overall result.
Oddly enough this converges with the proposal currently favoured in the
Labour party, which would keep the present British system for 500 MPs, but
allow 150 to be chosen on a party list system. Such ideas approximate to,
but fall well short of, the system used in Germany. There, half the seats
are filled from single-member constituencies, the other half from party
lists in such a way that each party's share of seats in the Bundestag is
proportionate to its share of the popular vote, with the important
qualification that parties obtaining less than 5 per cent of the votes cast
get no seats at all.
If what Italians want is to keep a reasonably representative system while
abolishing the overweening power of party politicians, they should consider
the single transferable vote system (STV). This is used in the Irish
Republic; in Northern Ireland (for local and European, but not Westminster,
elections); and in Malta, which one might think quite close to Italy
culturally as well as geographically. But for some reason it is never
mentioned in discussions on the continent.
In Britain, STV is usually advocated as a form of PR, but in a way that
misses the point. PR is purely concerned with the relative strengths of
political parties, taking for granted that voters identify with parties and
wish to be represented by them. (That probably explains why there is little
discussion of PR in the US, where political parties are relatively
unimportant and personal followings, especially on the local level, count
for much more.)
STV, by contrast, ignores the existence of parties. Voting takes place in
multi-member constituencies, but votes are cast for individual candidates,
not for party lists. Voters number the candidates in order of preference, in
which they may or may not be influenced by party affiliation or endorsement.
In so far as they do follow party advice the result will tend to be
proportional, because surplus votes for a successful candidate are
transferred to the voter's next choice. But marginal seats will often be
decided between two parties by the second or lower preferences of voters
whose first choice - whether already elected, or eliminated as having two
few votes to win a seat in his own right - was a candidate of neither.
Thus the final outcome may give a different ranking of parties than would a
straight proportional system, and yet be more representative, because even
voters whose first choice was eliminated will be represented by their second
or lower choice. This has the effect of limiting the number of parties in
parliament, but in a more democratic way than either the single-member
constituency system or the use of a percentage threshold - both of which
effectively disfranchise supporters of small parties.
Most politicians hate STV, because it is subversive of party discipline.
Even national leaders can on occasion be beaten by challengers from within
their own party, if they lose touch with local opinion. That has led
Labour's Plant Commission (chaired by Professor Raymond Plant) to reject STV
as 'capricious'. But what it really means is that ordinary voters gain power
at the expense of party bosses. In the present European - and especially
Italian - political climate, that is surely a point in its favour.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Arts: Escapism, both good and bad - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Was it not perverse, they say, for the television critic to take a
seven-week sabbatical starting on the very day that the new-look ITV was
launched? On the face of it that seemed true. Yet abandoning Britain and ITV
at the end of December and returning to the old green sofa in mid-February
was rather like switching your gaze between two of those 'spot the
difference' cartoons: you know there are supposed to have been all sorts of
changes, yet you cannot actually see any.
Mention this sotto voce to your colleagues and they say 'Well, what about
the breakfast stuff? There has been a lot written about that'. They do not
say that they have watched and there are differences, mind, merely that
there has been a lot written about it, which is true. But then breakfast
television on the commercial channels is for pre-school children (hence the
toy advertisements). Why would sane adults watch such tosh when they could
be reading a decent newspaper or listening to the radio? How many of your
friends have enthused over the new look breakfast television? Quite.
Well then, say your better informed and more addicted informants, how about
the local news? It is true that the presenters of the 10-minute regional
news which follows News At 10 look unfamiliar - but then they always did. In
common with all the Londoners I know, I have only ever watched this peculiar
adjunct by mistake. So much of the national news comes out of the metropolis
anyway that it seems contrived to tack on another 10 minutes just because
the Scots or the Devonians need the time to keep in touch with their local
affairs. Anyway there are precious few interests common to all the millions
of Londoners: we would need Kentish Town news or Battersea news to be of any
real use.
Finally your patient informers begin to name individual series: Head Over
Heels, The Good Sex Guide, The Beat and . . . er . . . A Day In The Life. It
is true that these programmes (and perhaps there are more, though they do
not spring readily to the minds of my acquaintances) have been made by the
new companies, but had they been screened by the old ITV nobody would have
batted an eyelid. Moreover scores of programmes, the overwhelming majority
every night, remain completely unchanged. Tonight's ITV schedule features
This Is Your Life, Coronation Street, News At 10 and two old American movies
 -scarcely a revolution.
Still, tonight's one new programme may, perhaps, be a straw in the wind. It
seems that Life is to offer 'factual entertainment' comprising 'a global
compendium of human triumphs and tragedies' plus astrology, and, tonight, a
tarantula in the studio. In other words, bitty tabloid journalism. True,
this column has been charting the increase in such material for a couple of
years, but it may well be that the opening of the new ITV will accelerate
the process. On Wednesday afternoons Londoners can now watch The Chrystal
Rose Show where, we are told, 'audience and guests alike talk about their
passions and confess their sins': an English version of The Oprah Winfrey
Show, Chrystal Rose being another black woman.
The chances of a normal looking, normal sounding, white English male
presenter getting a job on any of these new 'infotainment' shows looks
pretty slim. Loyd Grossman is going to present The View which promises to
'tackle serious questions of broadcasting policy and politics combined with
humour and a genuine enthusiasm for telly trivia' (guess where the emphasis
will lie) and Grossman is white and male, but of course he has that Martian
accent which puts him in the weirdo category along with people such as Pyke
and Bellamy. Life is to be presented by a woman and a black man, and The
Good Sex Guide is not so much presented as hurled at us by the blokish Margi
Clarke. Yet another series which, from the advance publicity sounds like
bitty, tabloid, 'human interest' current affairs material, begins tomorrow
evening: 3D. It will be presented by Julia Somerville.
So although ITV may not look dramatically different, it does seem as though
more and more of its programmes are being aimed at Sun readers, and more and
more of its output, even in slots supposedly devoted to journalism, may turn
out to be escapist trivia. As 1993 progresses we may be thanking our lucky
stars increasingly often for the existence in Britain of BBC2 and Channel 4,
networks which still see it as part of the function of television to tell a
nation the truth about itself. Last Thursday Newsnight on BBC2 used a
journey down the A1 to illustrate the erosion of Britain's manufacturing
base, and the appalling miasma of despondency caused by unemployment. The
minister in the studio who made the pained observation that a journey down
some other obscure road could have revealed a new Japanese factory merely
reinforced the point.
Then in the first of a new series of Opinions on Sunday Channel 4 gave a
platform to former defence minister Alan Clark to argue for a radical
reappraisal of Britain's difficulties and an equally radical programme to
solve them. Even if you disagreed with him it was heartening to see such
stuff on television. Better still in a way were the first two programmes in
a new series produced by old hands at the documentary game, Roger Graef and
Paul Watson. Decades ago Graef made the seminal verite series The Space
Between Words about communication within human institutions. His new
three-part C4 series Turning The Screws is said to be about 'life inside
Wandsworth Prison' but the first episode with its union negotiations
suggested that it is still the business of communication that really
fascinates him.
Almost as long ago Watson made the notorious series about the Wilkins of
Reading, The Family, and much later was responsible for a memorable episode
in 40 Minutes called 'The Fishing Party' about four Hooray Henrys. Now he
has been made editor of 40 Minutes and his opening edition, directed by Ted
Clisby, was again about fishermen, this time builders, mostly unemployed,
who fished and gossiped about the state of the nation in a slow and gentle
yet curiously telling programme.
Best of all, though, is Dennis Potter's new six-part dreama (a Freudian
spelling error which I have no intention of correcting) on Channel 4,
Lipstick On Your Collar. After the miming to 1930s popular songs in Pennies
From Heaven and to '40s songs in The Singing Detective the wonderful shock
element is missing when the bumf merchants at the 1950s War Office start to
bump and grind to a '50s song in this production. Yet even Potter
free-wheeling and re-using a previous formula is more entertaining than most
television dramatists using something brand new.
Perhaps this time there is slightly too much dwelling upon the period detail
 -everything from Ascot water heaters to an authentically hefty suspender
belt - and the narrative seems, uncharacteristically for Potter, rather
stretched out. Yet he is quite incapable of making an uninteresting drama,
or one without acid social comments, and sure enough he has much to remind
us about this time concerning Britain's international role and standing at
the time of Suez, the stultifying effects of the British class system,
especially in the armed forces, and, as ever, the desperate size of the gap
between the sexual ambitions of young men and their actual sexual
experience. It makes for splendid television.
Thank heavens for BBC2 and Channel 4.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Arts: Murder is easy - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Murder may be easy, as several of the characters in Agatha Christie's
thriller keep saying; it is much harder to guess whodunnit. It was not until
about page 222 of the book - only 30 pages from the end - that I reckoned I
knew for certain who was the guilty party. Clive Exton's stage version
maintains the suspense just as long; anyone who guesses at the interval will
almost certainly be wrong.
Guessing is what you are intended to do. Murder is Easy is an old-fashioned
thriller without psychological frills. As the adapter of many of the Poirot
stories for television, Exton is a master of the craft. I am inclined to say
that on stage Christie works better, as here, without either a Poirot or a
Miss Marples as the central investigator: just a one off set of people who
happen to be involved in murder.
Exton has re-arranged, simplified and to some extent modernised the original
plot. There is one murder fewer: the figure of Dr Humbleby is missing. This
is a pity because it slightly reduces the number of motives and suspects,
but perhaps the full text would have been too complex for the stage.
Lord Whitfield has become a rather grander press magnate than he seemed in
the book. He owns three national titles and 16 magazines. Played by Nigel
Davenport, he gives instructions to his Fleet street editors down a
megaphone from the village of Wychwood-Under-Ashe. Speaking with a Hampshire
accent, he never seems like Lord Beaverbrook nor even Robert Maxwell, but
maybe in these matters it is sensible not to be too close to life, and it is
part of the technique that nobody is presented as particularly dislikeable:
it makes the guessing all the harder.
Charlotte Attenborough as Bridget, Lord Whitfield's secretary-cum-fiancee,
has become a thoroughly practical modern woman: ready to marry for money
because the marital duties will not be much different from the secretarial,
but vastly better rewarded. No-one would accuse her of base motives. She
looks remarkably attractive and self-confident throughout.
The weakness is perhaps the straight male lead played by Peter Capaldi who
arrives in the village suspecting that murders have taken place and
determined to investigate. Almost inevitably therefore he ceases to be
interesting, for not even by the wildest stretch of imagination could he be
regarded as a suspect. This is not entirely Capaldi's fault, but he could be
a bit more lively.
There are compensations in some of the smaller parts: for example, Jo
Kendall as the cleaning lady with eight children, two of them dead. Ms
Kendall has some wonderful physical movements and plays a splendid scene
with Roger Booth as Major Horton, whose wife has just died. Irene Sutcliffe
as Honoria Waynflete, a well-born village spinster, knows how to create a
frisson when she wants to. There is also some black comedy, notably
concerning what happened to her pet canary.
The sets, designed by Christopher Morley and Christopher Woods, are
ambitious, moving from Lord Whitfield's ostentatiously structured house to
more homely surroundings and to the local downs where strange practices
occur. Sometimes the scene changes are a little slow, as is the general
direction by Wyn Jones. All that can be speeded up. The main thing is to
keep guessing. No-one can guarantee that Murder is Easy will run for 40
years or even 40 months, but no-one predicted that about the Mousetrap
either.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Arts: Weird weddings and wild nights - The winners and
losers in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seldom does a film festival act as midwife to an entire new sub-genre. But
at Berlin a newcomer screamed into the daylight while critics gasped,
onlookers applauded and everyone tried to determine whether it was a boy or
a girl. Eventually they blithely shrugged and christened it the Gay With A
Hint Of Straight Movie.
In each of three high-profile festival films - Japan's Okoge, France's Les
Nuits Fauves and Taiwan's Golden Bear-winning The Wedding Banquet - a gay
relationship is broken into by a heterosexual one, real or token, and the
world has a brief, startling glimpse of non-sectarian sexuality.
Cyril Collard's Les Nuits Fauves is the most untamed of the films. The 'wild
nights' are enjoyed by Collard himself as the thirtyish hero, an
HIV-positive film-maker swinging between a teenage girl and a young
sportsman. Unprotected sex abounds: the director all but invites you to hiss
as his (anti)hero hops from bed to bed, with time off for grope sessions in
a gay cruising ground by the Seine. And unprotected aesthetics are also
favoured. No genteel, cellophaned visuals here, as the handheld camera
shudders from quarrel to punch-up to romance and back again.
At best the film is vividly personal, like animated pages torn from a diary.
At worst it can seem like a long session of anarcho-narcissism, with a
tacked-on moralistic ending as specious as a deathbed repentance. Either
way, everyone talked and quarrelled about the film: which is exactly how
life at a festival should be.
Pick of the Far East's two AC/DC entries was Ang Lee's The Wedding Banquet.
Where Takehiro Nakejima's Okoge is a pleasant but puzzling comedy about a
girl's friendship with two gay lovers - just why, we wonder, is she so
besotted with them that she trails round Tokyo in their wake, lends them her
spare bedroom, purrs at the sound of homo-erotic bliss through the
rice-paper walls? - Lee's film takes a similar plot and turns it into a
crowd-pleaser that also makes dramatic and psychological sense.
The hero (Winston Chao), a Taiwanese yuppie in New York, devotes half his
emotional energies to living with his gay American lover (Mitchell
Lichtenstein of Streamers), the other half to parrying parental postcards
urging marriage. One day Ma and Pa turn up for a two-week visit. Stashing
away the gay calendars and muscle magazines, the lovers masquerade as
flatmates. Then a Taiwanese girl painter who wants a 'green card' to stay in
America is roped in as bride for a let's-make-the-folks-happy wedding.
There are loud laughs in this comedy with sentimental trimmings. But for a
two-hour chunk of 'feelgood' cinema, it also succeeds in avoiding false
notes. When the lies and masquerades come unstuck, the story totters towards
human disaster: only to right itself by going deeper into the characters
rather than blanding them out for a happy ending.
The Wedding Banquet shared an all-Eastern Golden Bear with The Lake Of
Scented Souls, reviewed by me last week. Justice was done. Nothing else in
the Berlin Competition sent one out glowing like these two films. Indeed
much moviegoing was like dancing over hot coals: as you avoided one clinker,
another lay in awful wait. You winced as you stepped on Holland's The
Homecoming, a darkly ludicrous murder film shot as if by the light of a
single candle. Then you scraped your sole painfully on Nordic angst in
Norway's The Telegraphist or Denmark/Sweden's Heartache.
Outside the competition life was more dependable. There was a cluster of
good retrospectives (CinemaScope, Billy Wilder, Gregory Peck); there were Mr
Wilder and Mr Peck themselves on show; and there was King Kong growling away
atop the festival theatre.
Oh, and there was one final interesting oddity in the competition. It was
Andrew Birkin's The Cement Garden. Ian McEwan's novel about incest,
gardening and unusual burial procedures (look for Mum inside the metal
locker filled with cement) is filmed in a grey, toneless, but oddly
bewitching sfumato as if through clouds of opium smoke. Since the film was
co-produced by France and Germany, there are incongruous Euro-actors:
notably Charlotte Gainsbourg, Birkin's niece, as the daughter. But someone
has done a fine dubbing job. They all sound as if they come the grungier
reaches of British suburbia, and an initially unpromising film ends up
holding you in sickly, sepulchral thrall.

The billing for Life (8.00 ITV) describes it as 'a one-off live programme',
but the publicity material asserts 'the philosophy behind Life' is that it
will be compelling and sometimes controversial'. It seems that the makers
expect a series while the fierce new network controllers may have different
ideas. It sounds like precisely the sort of material we have been warned to
expect under the new ITV system: 'A global compendium of human triumphs and
tragedies', or what the Americans call 'infotainment'. We are promised
astrology and a visit to the studio by 'the world's largest venomous
spider'.
Timewatch supplies the lowdown on J. Edgar Hoover, moralistic head of the
FBI for nearly 50 years who, it now turns out, liked wearing pretty frocks
and had a long sexual relationship with the man who deputised for him (8.10
BBC2).
Mr Wroe's Virgins (BBC1 9.25) is a 4-part drama which takes the real-life
figure of John Wroe, 19th century prophet/preacher, and constructs fictional
stories around him about four of the seven virgins who provided 'comfort and
succour' in his Lancashire household.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Arts: Un ballo in maschera - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Verdi's Ballo in maschera and Wagner's Tristan und Isolde are in the current
repertory of Welsh National Opera. Both operas, composed at the same time,
have a soprano-tenor pair of illicit lovers whose second-act love duet -
long, structurally varied, shaped to reach an ecstatic climax - forms the
work's peak. Some years ago an Italian critic was moved to claim Ballo as
the 'Italian Tristan': this Welsh National Verdi revival, and its close
proximity to the company's brand-new Wagner production, comes helpfully to
hand in fixing both the aptness and the useful limits of the comparison.
In common with the new Tristan, the latest WNO Ballo casting has thrown up a
particularly strong principal pair - on Monday in the New Theatre, Cardiff,
their healthy, freely produced voices and forthright delivery fanned the
love music to a bright glow. The Australian Lisa Gasteen, who came to
prominence as the 1991 'Cardiff Singer of the World', is a young Verdian of
wonderfully rich potential: her spinto soprano has amplitude, a special soft
velour in lower ranges and a finespun radiance higher up, and her line is
long-breathed. Richard Margison, the Canadian Gustavus, sings with
appealing, well-nourished tenor tone lacking only suavity and finesse in the
application.
Neither singer achieves a fully idiomatic purchase on the Italian words  -
this fault, mirrored throughout the Anglo-Saxon cast, tended to blur the
exactly graded phases of emotional outpouring in the love music. But the
slancio of the singing, supported and encouraged by Carlo Rizzi's sensitive
conducting (nervously intense yet never overweight in orchestral mass, alert
to dramatic colour and tone, only occasionally rushed), certainly answers
many of the opera's most pressing demands.
This, in turn, makes the revival well worth tracking down. The 1982
production, by the late Goran Jarvefelt, was always one of the company's
most distinguished Verdi stagings, a 'Swedish' Ballo that draws depth,
resonance and a subtle, vivid theatricality from the setting. In its latest
appearance, supervised by Malcolm Hunter, there seems to be some coarsening
of detail. Not all the other main singers were on form on Monday - the press
but not the public were informed of the throat infections that audibly
burdened Donald Maxwell's Anckarstrom and Rebecca Evans's Oscar. Anne-Marie
Owens's fortune-teller was impressively firm and forceful.
Sponsored by 3M; two more Cardiff performances, then to Bristol, Liverpool,
Southampton, Oxford, Swansea and Birmingham. (We omitted to mention on
Monday that the Royal Opera's 'Turandot' is sponsored by UBS/Phillips &amp;

FT  24 FEB 93 / Arts: ENB's new Swan Lake - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English National Ballet has just presented us with a new Swan Lake. More
exactly, the company has invited Raissa Struchkova, greatly loved ballerina
of the Bolshoy Ballet for more than three decades, to mount a version of the
production which she knew in her home theatre during the 1940s and '50s. And
as frame for it, the designs that Carl Toms made for ENB's Swan Lake
before-last have been restored. The result is an effective and acceptable
presentation.
The company's track record with this ancient death-trap has not been happy.
One staging in the mid 1960s brought financial ruin; others have played
merry hell with the text; much of the designing has been unspeakable. The
rescuing of the Carl Toms decorations reveals them as being better than
memory recalled in the John Field production for which they were made in
1984. A Gothic palace, a mistily evocative lake, a grand ball-room, provide
excellent locations for Mme Struchkova's production. Costuming tends rather
to an unsaturated and creamy beige, but outlines are handsome, and when von
Rothbart has been treated for his make-up - galloping sequinitis - all will
be visually well.
In matter of staging, Mme Struchkova has clearly had to reduce and edit the
text she knew as ballerina, but the choreographic vision is consistent and,
mostly, coherent. The first three acts - and there is, mercifully, no
attempt to jam acts together in order to shorten running time - are the text
according to Alexander Gorsky, who made no less than five Swan Lake
recensions in Moscow in the first decades of this century when he directed
the Bolshoy Ballet. The choreography is fluent, interesting in its
patternings. The final lake-side act is that provided by Asaf Messerer for
the Bolshoy in 1937.
None of this choreography can efface the merits of the Petipa/Ivanov text we
know, but it is sympathetic to its dancers, and to its viewers. There are a
few naivetes, and the national dances of the third act - staged and
rehearsed by another Moscow artist, Alla Boguslavskaya - are beyond the
competence of any Western European dancers. (When Natalia Makarova staged
ENB's previous Swan Lake she excised them, rather than see them abused. As
performed by the Russian artists they can be the best thing of the evening:
a look at a currently available video of the Kirov Swan Lake testifies to
this. But Petersburg and Moscow train specialists in national dance; we give
them to the nearest available dancer). Only the tarantella, brightly done by
Alice Crawford and Eugenio Scigliano on Monday night, when I saw the
staging, looked credible.
This Swan Lake, as with so many Soviet-age productions, has the happy ending
demanded by socialist realism. Love conquers von Rothbart's spell, and
though the stage action sits oddly on the music (and von Rothbart's last
moments are not unlike a man trying to tango with himself), we are spared
the sight of Odette and Siegfried going to paradise in a spectral dodgem
car. We accept the good emotional intentions.
The production, in sum, is a success, and more than that, it has engaged the
attentions of ENB's artists, who are dancing with a sense of purpose that
seemed missing in the quagmire of last season's repertory. But Swan Lake is
still a 19th century ballerina-vehicle, and in an age perilously short of
artists worthy of the title, this must present serious problems. Agnes Oaks,
the Odette/Odile on Monday night, has a clear, true physique. Her view of
the double role is dutiful, but as yet she has not found the lyric urgency,
the hallucinatory beauty, that will bring this choreography to full
emotional life. At her best, in the final act, she shows a grieving dignity
that is appealing, and a largeness of physical outline to make the final
happy resolution credible.
It is Thomas Edur, as Siegfried, who dominates the evening by the elegance
of his means. As dancer, his every step, every action, is polished,
graceful. His manner combines purity with very considerable technical
resource - movement deeply satisfying not just because he jumps high, turns
well, but because he shows how noble is his art in its physical ideals. As
an actor he is sensitive, and establish a climate of feeling proper for the
action. His 'quietness' on stage is fascinating: nothing is forced, or
mis-shapen by temperament. He is an aristocrat, and he dignifies everything
he dances.
In an age over-populated with swans - most of whom, as readers of these
columns must be aware, are hideous mutants - this staging does its duty by
Tchaikovsky and by the popular image of Swan Lake. It shows not only what
audiences want to see, but what they deserve to see. And that is no mean
achievement.
English National Ballet is touring this new 'Swan Lake': at the Mayflower
Theatre, Southampton until February 27; at the Manchester Opera House from
March 8 - 13. Production sponsored by Unilever

FT  24 FEB 93 / People: Thorpe picks Imro over SFA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Top jobs at City regulatory institutions have been much on offer recently -
with the Securities &amp; Investments Board and three self-regulatory
organisations, Imro, the SFA and PIA, the controversial new retail financial
services SRO, all looking for chief executives in the past month or two.
Following SFA boss John Young's appointment to SIB, Phillip Thorpe, deputy
chief executive of the securities and futures industry SRO, and widely
regarded as a strong candidate to replace Young, has decided to take up the
seat at Imro that falls vacant on the retirement of John Morgan.
Thorpe (right) who, since October, has been working on the Large review of
the workings of SIB to be presented to the chancellor next month, says it
was the 'element of reconstruction' that attracted him. 'I am not saying
that there hasn't been a lot of work done at Imro in the wake of the
post-Maxwell soul-searching. But there is still considerable capacity to be
added. And then there is the key part, which is making it all work.'
A straight-talking New Zealander, whom industry observers hope will inject a
breath of fresh air into the sometimes clubby and inward-looking world of
money management, Thorpe, 38, had spent a year before his current assignment
on secondment from the SFA to London FOX following the discovery of
irregularities at the exchange.
He acknowledges that most of his experience, in London and Hong Kong, has
been in legal and regulatory posts involving securities and futures broking
 -one reason for accepting the challenge of Imro rather than courting the
SFA position - but he says he reminds his new parishioners that he was also
chairman of the unit trust and mutual fund committee in Hong Kong in the
late 1980s.
Adds Charles Nunneley, Imro's chairman: 'We wanted someone who would work
with a firm hand. We would have preferred to go for a practitioner and we
saw one or two but we decided in the end on the best person for the job.'
Morgan, 61, who had previously managed the British Rail Pension Fund, steps
down in July.
*****
Peter Hedges, who stepped down as chairman of Taylor Woodrow's property
division last September, has resurfaced as a non-executive director of Ward
Holdings, the Kent-based housebuilder which has been one of the companies
hardest hit by the slump in house-building in the south-east.
Hedges, 49, joined Taylor Woodrow in 1966 as a development surveyor and was
appointed a member of the board in 1986. As chairman of Taylor Woodrow
Property he was responsible for a number of big property developments in the
UK and overseas. There has been a considerable reshuffle at the top of
Taylor Woodrow over the last year and some analysts speculated that Hedges
quit because he may have been passed over for the top job.
He joins the board of the family-controlled Ward Holdings as it is starting
to recover from the severe slump in the industry. It lost Pounds 5.3m last
year and passed its final dividend. Apart from a directorship of
TransEuropean Properties, Hedges has been working as a consultant for
Bankers Trust and various firms of liquidators since he quit TW.
*****
Graeme Wall, who has particular responsibility for the Anglian operation,
has been appointed to the main board.
*****
Brian Pearse, the 59-year-old chief executive of Midland Bank, has picked up
his first non-executive directorship. He joins the board of Smith &amp; Nephew,
the 137-year-old healthcare group on March 1.
Pearse, who started his banking career with Liverpool's Martins Bank in
1950, is one of two new non-execs. He is joined by Sir Anthony Cleaver, 54,
who is chairman of IBM UK and a director of General Accident.
S&amp;N, whose earnings have fallen for the past couple of years, has been
regarded as one of the more paternalistic companies in its sector with its
board dominated by 'Smith &amp; Nephew men'. However, Eric Kinder, who took over
as chairman in May 1990, has been bringing more non-executives on to his
board and says that he has now reached his target of a 50/50 balance between
execs and non-execs.
S&amp;N is a big fan of Pro-Ned, the Bank of England-backed organisation that
promotes non-executives. Kinder says it has no 'vested interest'; it just
puts 'good people in touch with good companies'.
Sir Francis Kennedy, who has been on the board since 1988, was found through
Pro-Ned, as was Nancy Lane, a microbiologist at Oxford University, who
joined in October 1991. Sir Anthony also came via Pro-Ned. However, Pearse
was introduced to S&amp;N by Sir Francis Kennedy some years ago and it has been
keen to recruit him for some time.
Kinder says he did not want to recruit 'good' non-execs per se but was keen
that they have different areas of expertise.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Management: Forcing a change of direction / Challenging the
belief that private-sector managerial practices will reform the police and
the National Health Service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pace of structural and managerial change in the UK police force is about
to quicken. But the trepidation felt by many officers is not confined to the
likely introduction of performance-related pay and the short, fixed-term
contracts which will come in if forces are amalgamated.
Some chief constables doubt whether ideas being considered by Kenneth
Clarke, the home secretary, for bringing private-sector style personnel and
financial management practices into the police force have been proven.
When the inquiry into police responsibilities and rewards under Sir Patrick
Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, reports in May it will almost certainly
endorse and encourage moves, under way in some forces, to thin out senior
levels of command and develop a flatter management structure. The
introduction of performance-related pay is also being considered.
Clarke is separately conducting an examination of structure that could
reduce the present 43 forces in England and Wales to 20-25. Lay members will
join the Inspectorate of Constabulary for the first time in its 137-year
history, to bring financial and personnel management experience to the task
of scrutinising police performance.
He is likely to follow this by putting appointees with business experience
on police authorities.
Although chief constables' day-to-day operational powers exceed those of
many public-sector managers, the service remains a local government
responsibility. Police authorities draw two-thirds of their members from
local councillors and one-third from magistrates.
Appointing people with business experience would mirror the structure of
trust hospital boards established by Clarke when he was health secretary.
Some chief constables - and some National Health Service managers - wonder
if all private-sector appointees have quite as much to teach public-sector
managers as ministers may assume.
'Police forces employ thousands of people, have multi-million pound budgets
and provide a complex range of services 24-hours a day,' says Peter Ryan,
chief constable of Norfolk. 'I frequently show private sector business
people around my headquarters and many of them comment that they don't have
anything like our management expertise in their own companies.'
Norfolk and its neighbour Suffolk are typical of forces Clarke may have in
mind as potential candidates for amalgamation - possibly with Cambridgeshire
as well - into an East Anglian force.
Serious crime and other specialised police activities are already
co-ordinated across forces. Consortium tendering arrangements give smaller
forces benefits of scale when purchasing equipment. And chief constables
value their links with local authorities.
Is there, to set against all this, a convincing business case for creating
combined forces such as West Midlands, Greater Manchester, West Mercia and
Devon &amp; Cornwall?
'The best that can be said for the case in favour of larger forces is that
it has not been proved,' says Anthony Coe, chief constable of Suffolk, who
has studied the effects of size on police forces. 'There may be scope for
some amalgamations, just as some existing forces may be too big. I do not
believe there is a single ideal size. It depends on the structure,
demography and sociology of particular communities.'
Coe acknowledges that amalgamations would generate savings at chief officer
level, although he suspects these would be marginal compared with a tendency
towards greater bureaucracy in bigger organisations. 'But there is no
automatic correlation between force size and performance.'
Measuring performance between police forces is difficult because communities
differ as do demands on their local police. But using 1991-92 data from the
Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, Coe concludes the
average cost per officer in the six largest non-metropolitan forces was 2.4
per cent - or nearly Pounds 750 per head - higher than in the six smallest.
If crime figures are used as an indicator of police performance, Coe's
analysis shows crime has risen faster in areas policed by big forces, while
detection rates in those areas have fallen.
'There are many possible explanations,' he cautions. 'All I am saying is
that the case in favour of bigger forces is presumably based on the belief
that they are more cost-effective and efficient. Those putting forward the
argument should be aware that there is no clear evidence to support it.'
Coe believes financial demands on smaller forces such as his own encourage
efficiency. 'Because we are small we have to be cost-conscious and get to
grips with the minute detail of budgets.'
Suffolk, in common with about half Britain's provincial forces, has
flattened its management structure, reducing the number of officers in
senior posts and devolving responsibility to local level. This saved Pounds
750,000 a year - the equivalent of an extra 45 officers on the beat.
Such processes are likely to go further after the Sheehy report, which could
lead to the abolition of some ranks - chief superintendent and chief
inspector are favourites to go, but others, like assistant chief constable,
could be at risk.
One of the distinctive features of police work is the high degree of
day-to-day decision-making responsibility it places on the individual
constable. This reality is likely to be increasingly recognised in the way
the service is managed.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Management: Growing NHS casualty list
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WENDY MOORE

<TEXT>
An unwelcome aspect of the drive for greater efficiency in the NHS has been
the tendency to imitate the private sector's more ruthless employers.
The increase in job insecurity in the National Health Service can be gauged
by the response to a helpline run by the Institute of Health Services
Management. Calls from managers asking for legal advice on mainly employment
issues have now risen to 50 a month.
General managers with 20 or 30 years' experience are being 'written off',
says Pam Charlwood, lHSM director, with no attempt at retraining or personal
development and despite widespread shortages of managerial skills.
She cites examples of managers leading their hospitals to self-governing
trust status - in the teeth of fierce local opposition - only to be denied
the post of chief executive without so much as an interview.
'I think we flatter ourselves and abuse private-sector management by
assuming it does things more crudely than we do,' says Charlwood. 'Sometimes
it is almost the reverse.'
At the same time the fashion for merging health authorities means managers
are effectively competing for their own jobs.
The prospect of further mergers and another round of trusts means the
casualties will continue to mount, she believes.
Amid the battlefield, though, one region's approach is being heralded as a
model of good practice.
North West Thames regional health authority has reorganised into seven
health commissions, causing 20 managers to compete for seven new posts. But
the bloodshed has been minimised by a programme designed to balance the
future of individuals against the needs of the organisation. Personnel
manager Janet McKeown examined practice in both public and private sectors
before opting to develop her own system.
This gave existing general managers first call on the new posts. Only if a
suitable candidate was not selected would outsiders be allowed to apply.
Before competition began all were guaranteed every help in continuing their
careers within the region or elsewhere in the NHS. Each underwent an
independent assessment with a top company of occupational psychologists
followed by career counselling.
If the region could ultimately offer no job it guaranteed 'fair' severance
terms. 'It has been enormously powerful in persuading managers that we would
deal with them decently and with dignity,' McKeown says.
Sound business reasons were one motive. 'We need to attract high-calibre
managers in the future so it is important we have a good reputation as an
employer.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / Managment: An unwelcome visitor calls - The imminent arrival
of works councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After more than 20 years of wrangling between the European Commission,
employers and unions, the European works councils will soon become a reality
 -and there will be no escape for about 100 of Britain's larger
multinational companies.
Within a couple of years companies such as ICI, Shell, British Airways and
Unilever, will have to meet representatives of employees at European level
at least twice a year to inform them of key investment, rationalisation and
merger decisions.
It will not cost them much - perhaps Pounds 50,000 a year to cover travel
and interpreters - but the majority of employers strongly resist the
proposal arguing that the councils will merely interfere with companies'
existing information systems.
They are also frightened by the enthusiasm for councils shown by unions,
which see them as the first step towards Europe-wide collective bargaining.
About 18 European multinationals, mainly French and German, have voluntarily
established Europe-wide councils and according to the research group
Industrial Relations Services another 31 are planning to follow. Those
companies are convinced that councils can help improve worker integration
and productivity but they are in a small minority.
The imminent arrival of mandatory works councils in British companies will
come as a surprise to many. Is not the EC's social dimension in retreat, as
a result of recession and disagreements between member states? And has not
Britain achieved its famous 'opt-out' from key aspects of future social
legislation?
Both points are true, but, as the recent dispute over Hoover's transfer of
jobs from France to Scotland shows, the rhetoric of the social dimension
still has political resonance. And it is Hoover that has placed the European
works council back in the limelight.
Assuming that Britain continues to block the introduction of works councils
through existing mechanisms for social legislation and assuming the
Maastricht treaty is ratified, the issue will move to the Social Chapter
mechanism agreed at Maastricht before the end of this year.
The Social Chapter, from which Britain has excluded itself, allows a far
wider range of issues, including works councils for informing employees, to
be covered by majority vote (rather than unanimity), and most observers
believe that legislation on works councils will be top priority.
The 11 Social Chapter countries will probably then send the issue to the
'social partners' - European employers and unions - for nine months of
discussion to see if they can reach agreement on the controversial details.
Employers say that the current directive, which has just been amended by
Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, has an arbitrary trigger mechanism
requiring a council to be set up in companies with more than 1,000 workers
which operate in at least two EC countries (with a minimum of 100 workers in
one of the countries).
Senior managers who make the important Europe-wide decisions must meet
employee representatives at least once a year. But the criterion for
subsequent meetings is vague - any management proposal with 'serious
consequences' for the interests of employees - which IBM Europe says could
have required 3,000 meetings last year.
About 900 undertakings operating in Europe would have been hit by the
original works council plan, of which more than 300 are British. About
one-third of those UK companies will still be hit, despite the opt-out,
because they qualify even excluding their British operations.
British companies with a council for their German, French and Italian
workers are unlikely to exclude their British workforces, even though they
could.
But Alan Wild, personnel director at Grand Metropolitan, says that if
companies include their British workers why not the Scandinavians too - and
at GrandMet's Burger King the relevant management decision-makers also cover
Africa and the Middle East.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Weather wise - Typhoons,
hurricanes and the threat of global warming are pushing up insurance rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE GET zapped every five minutes,' says Richard Keeling, underwriter with
Lloyd's syndicate 362, reviewing the impact of recent hurricanes, gales and
typhoons on the London insurance market.
Recent storms, each more damaging than the last, culminated in last year's
hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of Louisiana and Florida and caused
losses estimated to be at least Dollars 16bn and perhaps as much as Dollars
20bn (Pounds 14bn), the United States's biggest-ever insured loss.
That has triggered tough bargaining in the London insurance market and one
of the hardest 'renewal' seasons, as reinsurers seek to impose big rate
increases.
Most significantly, in a move that could lead to higher insurance rates for
many years, insurers are also beginning to ask whether recent storms are a
sign of global warming or other long-term shifts in weather patterns. The
question has led to an unlikely convergence with environmental pressure
groups such as Greenpeace, which last month published a long report
welcoming insurers' alertness to the risk.
In the recent round of negotiations, brokers buying cover for US clients -
who have avoided heavy increases in recent years - have found the going
toughest.
However, across the board, direct insurers are now paying more for their
reinsurance. Keeling says that since October 1987, reinsurance rates have
increased by 650 per cent for European insurers, 450 per cent for US buyers
and by 1,000 per cent for Japanese companies.
The increases partly reflect reinsurers' efforts to restore profitability
after heavy losses from weather and from other disasters such as the 1988
Piper Alpha oil rig explosion and the Exxon Valdez oil spill the following
year.
Both Swiss Re and Munich Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, have seen
profits dented and have been forced to draw deep into their reserves to meet
claims, especially from the European storms of 1990. Many smaller reinsurers
have withdrawn from the market. More than a third of Lloyd's Names and
nearly half the syndicates have left the market since 1989. As competition
for business has dwindled, bigger players have found it easier to force
through rate increases.
Underwriters are also now beginning to take a deeper look at the risk of
storm damage. They recognise that denser population in potentially exposed
regions, such as the south-eastern coast of the US, is partly responsible
for the rise in losses. 'Windstorm' cover has also become a more common
element of householders' policies over the last two decades in most
countries.
And increasingly many are questioning whether the recent increases in land
and sea temperatures are leading to greater atmospheric instability and more
frequent and intense winds. Scientists have warned for several years that
gases such as carbon dioxide, emitted from burning fossil fuels, could cause
global warming.
The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, set up to
investigate the phenomenon, has suggested the average increase could be
somewhere between 1.5'C and 3.5'C over the next 100 years.
However, scientists have emphasised there is still uncertainty about the
processes involved - the models find it hard to take account of clouds,
which could slow down warming. They also say it is impossible to conclude
from recent storms and warm summers that climate change is already
happening.
Despite scientific uncertainty, insurers feel they need to protect
themselves. Walter Kielholz, general manager of Swiss Re, one of the first
insurance companies to question whether global warming could be responsible
for worsening weather, agrees that 'the statistical data is too short to
conclusively prove that there is a trend'. But he adds: 'It might just be a
hiccup but we can't afford to wait for the long-term before taking action.'
Research commissioned by Keeling and several other Lloyd's underwriters by
the University of East Anglia's climatology department also concludes: 'The
possibility that the trend (of more frequent gales in north-western Europe)
is related to global warming cannot be rejected.' Insurers should assume
that 'gale frequencies will remain at the level of the 1980s' and could rise
further, the report says.
In Greenpeace's recent study, the pressure group called for insurers to join
the lobby for limits on the emission of 'greenhouse gases'. Keeling
acknowledges: 'We have to do something constructive but the insurance
industry will never be a lobby. We are too diffused.'
Instead, as well as increasing rates insurers have begun to toughen the
terms of storm insurance. Kielholz says that since 1990 Swiss Re has begun
to isolate the risk of 'windstorm' from other exposures it underwrites.
The group now likes to cover windstorm through an excess of loss reinsurance
contract (in which the reinsurer covers a tranche of risk up to a pre-set
limit) rather than by covering it alongside other risks as part of a
proportional reinsurance deal (in which the reinsurer accepts an agreed
percentage of exposure).
'Reinsurers have become more and more reluctant to include windstorm in
proportional property treaties,' says Kielholz.
Reinsurers are also urging direct insurers to make policyholders pay the
first portion of any loss themselves, as an incentive to protect their
property against storms. Householders would then be more likely to carry out
essential maintenance and commercial customers to follow building codes more
strictly, they argue. During Hurricane Andrew many new buildings, especially
those with steel frames and metal casings, proved to be particularly
vulnerable to wind damage, according to Swiss Re.
Higher rates and tougher terms are the insurance industry's perhaps
unsurprising response to recent storms and the potential threat of global
warming.
The environmental movement has shown itself reluctant to acknowledge
scientific doubts about climate change, while climatologists - who might
stress that uncertainty - have few reasons to get involved in debates on
insurance charges. Customers may have to hope the new higher rates help
preserve some of the financially weaker groups, and so preserve competition
in the industry.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Travelling down a cleaner
track - Plans for a high-speed rail service between Boston and New York are
under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Compared with the sleek bullet trains of Japan and the high-speed railways
of Europe, the plodding US system sometimes seems hopelessly outdated.
Environmentalists have complained that the lack of sophisticated public
transportation in the country has increased the number of cars on the road
and contributed to the smog which plagues many US cities.
New plans for a high-speed rail system between Boston and New York could,
though, soon make a difference for the north-east region of the country.
Amtrak, the privately-owned rail group, has announced plans to run a
high-speed train along this route, pledging an investment of some Dollars
300m (Pounds 210m) for new equipment.
The concept of high-speed train travel has become fashionable in the US.
President Bill Clinton mentioned high-speed rail during his campaign as a
way of improving the economy and alleviating highway pollution. Funding for
high-speed rail travel is part of the administration's new economic stimulus
plan.
Installation of the system would require Dollars 200m in federally-funded
track and signal improvements, but Amtrak has already garnered plenty of
political support. The Coalition of North-east Governors (Coneg), which
represents the governors of all the New England states, is behind the
proposal, and several members of Congress are working on legislation to
allocate funding to the system.
A study prepared by engineering consultants Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade &amp;
Douglas for Coneg said the new system would cut pollution in the north-east
by reducing air and highway travel between Boston and New York. According to
the study, high-speed rail in the region would eliminate an annual 2,522
tonnes of carbon monoxide, 329 tonnes of hydrocarbons and 265 tonnes of
nitrogen oxides.
These benefits would be partially offset by a 385-tonne surge in sulphur
dioxide and a 48-tonne increase in particulates annually through emissions
generated by the new, electrified rail system.
Still, PBQD says the environmental impact would be overwhelmingly positive,
with an estimated 2,683-tonne reduction in pollutants every year. The
north-east rail corridor has long been a problem for Amtrak. The tracks are
among the oldest in the country, and were laid out to service the sea ports
of New England.
The Amtrak service winds along the coast from Boston to New York, providing
travellers with some breathtaking views, but making for an unusually long
journey - four and a half to five hours. A car can cover the distance in
four hours, and an aircraft in just one.
Amtrak claims that a high-speed train system would make the same trip in
just three hours, stealing nearly 3m passengers a year from airline and
highway traffic between the two cities. 'About 80 per cent of that will come
from air, 20 per cent from cars,' says David Carol, director of the
high-speed rail project for Amtrak.
Until now, the rail tracks in the north-east have been unsuitable for
high-speed service. The rail line makes the equivalent of 12 full circles
between Boston and New York, meaning that bullet trains, which travel along
a straight line at very high speeds, are unusable.
The straightening of the lines would be expensive, particularly since the
federal government allocates less money than countries such as Germany and
France to the upkeep of the railroads.
A new system inaugurated in Sweden in 1990, though, has made high-speed
service a possibility for New England. The X2000 model, built by ABB
Traction of Sweden, part of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish group, uses
a special tilting system which allows it to take curves at high speeds. An
X2000 can round a curve at 125 miles per hour, compared with 80 miles per
hour for a regular train.
The new high-speed system requires the electrification of the entire
north-east route, which is now suitable only for diesel trains. The diesel
cars have caused environmental havoc along the New England tracks, where
Amtrak is often out of compliance with provisions of the federal Clean Air
Act.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington DC, the
electric system would be kinder to air quality. Advocates hope the system
will also eliminate the need for highway and airport expansion around Boston
and other urban centres in the north-east.
But the high-speed rail system would not be good news for everyone. The
airlines, for instance, stand to lose a great deal of business on the
popular New York to Boston route. And critics say Amtrak's estimates of 3m
extra passengers a year may be exaggerated, considering Americans' penchant
for travel by car.
Still, the project has garnered much support and could be in operation
within a few years. Amtrak says if the north-east route is as successful as
it hopes, the group will install high-speed services along other corridors,
including between San Francisco and Los Angeles, Los Angeles and San Diego
and Chicago and Detroit.
'We are convinced that the regional benefits of this project would be a big
boost to the north-eastern states, both on the economic side and the
environmental side,' says Thomas Bolle, head of the department of
transportation at Coneg. 'That's why we've given full support to the idea of
high-speed rail in New England.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / Jobs: Even boredom can be a surprise - Although emotions
affect people's performance, no one knows much about how they work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO you happen to be bored out of your skull? If so, then although the Jobs
column will make every effort, perking you up is likely to prove a struggle.
The reasons, if we are to believe German researchers Reinhard Pekrun and
Michael Frese, are twofold.
The first is what's technically called mood-congruence. Memory tests show
that people in a happy mood tend to be best at recalling happy things, and
sad folk sad ones. So presumably anyone who starts out bored will be
mentally predisposed to find anything that happens more wearisome still.
The second reason why you'll probably resist my struggles is that the very
topic of boredom is boring, even to psychologists. Although there is clearly
a lot of it around in the workplace and elsewhere, hardly any of them have
bothered to study it.
Still, such research as they've done is not without surprises. For example,
while it seems tediously obvious that people in crassly monotonous jobs will
function like zombies, that is not always so. On occasion, they are almost
super-humanly productive.
A possible explanation is that dreary tasks sometimes go beyond merely
boring us into a stupor, and goad us into exasperated action. Shrinks have
now noted the difference in their jargon. They use the term 'boredom' only
for the stupefying kind, calling the energising sort 'satiation a state of
high arousal with a strong negative emotional content of resentment.'
Alas, whether you're satiated or just bored, the mood tends to persist. In
particular, it has more sticking-power than the 'positive emotions' like
happiness that can slip away like wet soap in a bath.
Even they produce the odd surprise in a work setting, the German pair say*.
Take decision-making for instance. Although positive emotion 'seems to
enhance an intuitive and holistic mode of thinking', it 'can induce
risk-aversion for higher risks' even while promoting a happy-go-lucky
approach to lighter risks. By contrast, sadness apparently 'induces more
analytic, detail-oriented, narrowly focused ways *In International review of
industrial &amp; organizational psychology, 1992. John Wiley, Pounds 30.
of cognitive problem-solving and making decisions'.
Yet when it comes to helping colleagues and customers, the opposite moods
tend to have the same effect. If either happy or sad, compared with feeling
some emotion between, we're more apt to help. Either way, too, the motive
may be selfish: helping in hope of hanging on to slippery happiness on the
one hand, or on the other in the hope of earning relief from our own sad
mood.
Perhaps fortunately, however, that isn't a certainty. For the two Germans'
prime finding is that what goes for boredom applies to emotions in general.
Although they clearly have a marked effect on our work, they have been very
little studied. Hence I'll return to them occasionally in weeks to come -
unless readers would find it too boring, that is.
NOW to the table alongside giving extracts from Day Associates' latest
three-monthly survey of pay and perks in City of London banks. Anyone
wanting the full report - covering 283 jobs in 123 banks of various sorts
and priced at Pounds 220 to those not taking part in the study - should
contact Joe Clark at Suite 2.31, 75 Whitechapel Rd, London E1 1DU; tel
(0)71-375 1397, fax 375 1723.
Limited to 16 managerial posts, the table starts with basic salaries. The
lower quartile refers to the person a quarter way up from the foot of a
ranking of all in the same type of job, the median to the person half way,
and the upper quartile to the one a quarter way down from the top. Next
comes the average salary, then the percentage of it typically received as a
bonus. The last two columns show the percentage of the job-holders with
cars, as distinct from car allowances which look to be coming into vogue,
followed by the vehicle's average price.
FINALLY today - a rare job, offered by Paul Child of Kramer Westfield for a
UK group he may not name. He promises to honour applicants' requests not to
be identified to the employer at this stage.
Having applied for a public telecommunications operator's licence, the group
is seeking a business development director to turn its plan into profitable
reality. With seven senior managers to help, the recruit will lead the
planning and implementation of all marketing and sales, including not only
product definition and customer development, but also negotiations with
regulatory bodies and potential associates.
Candidates must have made a name in the same field as hands-on managers as
well as strategic planners. They need to be as credible to merchant bankers
concerned with the industry as to technical staff working within it.
Salary indicator - which surely makes the banking figures to the left look
lavish - around Pounds 50,000 with car among perks. Inquiries to Garden
House, London Rd, Sunningdale, Berks SL5 0LL; tel (0)344 875087, fax 874877.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Private car clampers may be banned
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CLAMPING vehicles on private land in England and Wales may be outlawed by
the government as one of six options to tackle cowboy operators outlined
yesterday.
The others are good practice guidelines and self-regulation of the
wheel-clamping industry; clarification of the civil law; statutory
regulation of the wheel-clamping industry; statutory licensing of
wheel-clamp operators; and statutory licensing of land on which wheel-clamps
may be used.
The paper comes as pressure increases to tackle the methods used by cowboy
operators. These include:
Parking decoy cars to attract unsuspecting motorists.
Charging up to Pounds 240 to have a clamp removed.
Clamping cars while the engine is still running. Clamping disabled
motorists' cars.
Mr Michael Jack, home office minister, said: 'Any case for intervention must
strike the right balance between the interests of motorists and landowners.
This will be difficult to achieve as it involves both matters of public
interest and controls on essentially private transactions.'
The RAC described the consultation paper as an 'overdue' first step in
curbing excesses, while the AA echoed the need to strike a balance between
the rights of landowners and motorists.
Mr John Spellar, Labour MP for Warley West, whose 10-minute rule bill to
outlaw private car clampers in England and Wales is due for its second
reading on Friday, welcomed the paper.
He said: 'It's taken a long while . . . but it's a good document. It fairly
deals with the options and, although I would have a preference for a
complete banning, nearly all the options will spell the end of the cowboy
clampers.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour to seek social chapter vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR WILL tomorrow press its demand for another debate on Maastricht's
social chapter so that MPs can vote on a new amendment which - if passed -
the party believes could yet embarrass the government into including the
chapter in the treaty.
The opposition has new confidence that it has found a way of forcing the UK
government to choose between accepting the social chapter and being unable
to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
Comments from Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, on Monday have
encouraged both Labour and the Tory Euro-rebels to believe that a new social
chapter amendment might affect the UK government's ability to ratify. Labour
would then go on to argue that the social chapter should be included in
order for ratification to proceed.
Sir Nicholas appeared to concede that an amendment to exclude the social
protocol - which contains both the social chapter and the UK's 'opt-out'
from it - from the part of the bill extending the powers of the European
parliament would wreck the treaty.
This follows the government's conversion last week to the view that passing
the earlier Labour amendment, simply excluding the social protocol from UK
law, would not affect ratification.
When the Commons resumes detailed discussion of the Maastricht bill tomorrow
Mr George Robertson, the opposition European affairs spokesman, will ask Mr
Michael Morris, the deputy Speaker who chairs the proceedings, for an
opportunity to re-open the debate on social issues. An amendment along the
lines referred to by Sir Nicholas was tabled on Monday.
If Mr Morris does not allow MPs to talk about and vote on the new and
apparently effective Labour amendment, then the issue could be revived only
if MPs voted through any change to the bill, which would trigger an extra
stage of discussion.
Either way, the critical vote would not come for some weeks, giving time for
the government to exert pressure both on potential Tory rebels and on some
opposition parties.
All of the groupings will want to be sure of the legal position before
deciding what to do.
In particular, ministers believe that once the amendment was clearly
established as one that would wreck the treaty, the Liberal Democrats might
decide not to vote with other opposition parties.
Ministers are still confident that they will succeed in passing the bill and
emphasise that there is a majority in favour of Maastricht at Westminster,
in spite of this week's setback.
Tomorrow, when debate resumes on the planned Committee of Regions, Labour
will press for the committee's members to be elected - and may be joined by
MPs of other parties. Ministers believe, however, a Labour victory would not
jeopardise ratification.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley outlines plan for NHS
ranking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS VIRGINIA Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday announced a range of
measures aimed at enabling the National Health Service internal market to
operate freely while maintaining sufficient overall control.
The government also intends to start publishing league tables of health
service performance next year, based initially on indicators including
hospital waiting times, numbers of cancelled operations and ambulance
response rates. Other indicators, based, for example, on waiting times for
consultations with specialists, will follow later.
Ministers have spent many months trying to devise a structure for regulating
the reformed service without stifling it. Under the proposals announced
yesterday both regional health authorities and regional outposts of the NHS
management executive - set up to monitor trust hospitals - will be retained.
Some trust hospital managers had argued for the abolition of regional health
authorities, fearing that they will challenge the independence of trust
boards.
Mrs Bottomley said regions must remain to handle such issues as resource
allocation, financial control, and ensuring that comprehensive services were
available for patients. They would, however, be slimmed down from an average
of 560 staff to about 200.
The health secretary, speaking at a National Association of Health
Authorities and Trusts conference in London, emphasised the importance of
purchasing authorities and GP fundholders in targeting resources, obtaining
value for money and monitoring quality.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, is to visit all regions later this
year and assess progress on purchasing and contracting in the market.
Mrs Bottomley regards publication of the performance information, being
developed by the NHS management executive and the Audit Commission, as a
means of involving and empowering patients in the internal market.
Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the NHS, said yesterday that hospital
waiting lists were a rather 'crude and one-dimensional' way of monitoring
performance.
At present there was no way for the public to see which hospitals were
meeting standards set in the government's Patient's Charter, he said.
Labour accused Mrs Bottomley of 'dithering' over the best way to control the
internal market and described her speech as a combination of muddle and
fudge.
Calling for a 'far more radical redirection of policy', Mr David Blunkett,
the shadow health secretary, said yesterday's statement did nothing to
improve NHS accountability or make the service more responsive to patients.
He later pressed home his attack in the Commons, saying the speech was an
admission the market had failed.
Why pay Pounds 8m a year to members of English NHS trusts when central
control was now to be exercised, he asked.

problem 'spreads far beyond any government'.
Earlier, the issue was discussed in cabinet but officials said no

FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Attack on PM over long-term jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Smith accused Mr John Major of failing to understand the country's
deep concern about unemployment, as he launched a fierce attack over
yesterday's long-term jobless figures, David Owen writes.
The Labour leader marked the day when the number of people who had been out
of work for longer than one year officially crossed the 1m threshold by
reminding Mr Major that overall unemployment had risen 'every single month
since you took office'.
Taunting the prime minister that a problem had to reach 'crisis proportions'
before it appeared on the government's agenda, Mr Smith said it was
'appalling' that one in five of Britain's long-term unemployed were aged
between 18 and 24.
Mr Major retorted that the Labour leader had nothing but 'sound-bite
politics' to offer. The government had put in place 'the most varied,
comprehensive programme ever' to help the long-term jobless, he said.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd defends role on UN security
council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S ROLE as a permanent member of the UN security council was strongly
defended by Mr Douglas Hurd in the Commons yesterday.
Opening a debate on international peacekeeping the foreign secretary said
Britain would not participate in any US operation to airlift humanitarian
aid to Bosnia.
Mr Hurd said he felt 'some irritation' at comments that assumed nothing was
being done in Bosnia after the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
decided to suspend some aid convoys.
Dr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, said he was concerned aid
efforts on the ground could be disrupted by air drops.
'We need convincing that this will not only work in practice for the people
it is targeting, but also it will not fatally damage the effort . . . on the
ground,' he said.
Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister, made it clear that if talks on the
the Owen-Vance peace formula failed to make progress the UN security council
would be asked to tighten sanctions to seal the frontiers of Serbia and
Montenegro. He also indicated that Britain would be unlikely to participate
in any peacekeeping force to underpin an agreement unless the government
could be satisfied on a number of key conditions.
During the debate Mr Hurd said Britain was prepared to play a constructive
part in any discussion about the reform of the UN charter to take account of
changes in the international scene since it was drawn up in 1945, but he
stressed the need for caution.
'I do not believe, for example, that a simple proposition to add Germany and
Japan to the list of permanent members could survive without others from
other continents putting forward their claims.'
He argued that the Maastricht treaty took account of the fact that Britain
and France were the only nations in the European Community to hold permanent
membership of the security council.
Mr Hurd stressed: 'The treaty recognises our responsibilities under the
charter, and we accept the need to take the views of our partners into
account.'
Permanent membership of the security council also carried its obligations,
and he doubted whether it could be easily extended to countries which - for
their own constitutional reasons - would be unable to contribute troops to
the full range of UN peacekeeping activities.
Mr Hurd envisaged that discussion about possible reforms would continue for
a long time, and warned that it should not be allowed to frustrate or
undermine the efforts of the actual security council, which had never been
more in demand, in international peacekeeping.
National governments and international institutions needed to take account
of three main lessons: that it was better to move early to avert a disaster
than to clear up its consequences, that there had to be an equitable sharing
of burdens, and that there had to be a disciplined analysis of risks and
benefits so that the international community did not lurch into enterprises
without thinking them through.
Editorial Comment, Page 19
                      *      *      *
Other trouble spots highlighted by Mr Hurd included:
Arab-Israel dispute. The peace process sponsored by the US and Russia was
'really the only game in town'. While no one could realistically expect an
early and complete solution, all sides now seemed to genuinely contemplate
'the possibility of compromise, of real peace'.
Iraq. Severe punishment inflicted on the two imprisoned Britons Mr Ride and
Mr Wainwright in no way fitted their supposed offence. 'Iraq would gain some
credit for releasing them, and no gain from continuing to keep them in
unjust captivity,' Mr Hurd said.
Cyprus. Britain was helping to prepare ground for next round of talks which
he hoped would be attended by newly-elected President Clerides and Mr
Denktash under the chairmanship of the UN secretary-general.
Somalia. Mr Hurd praised the unified task force, particularly the US, on the
success of the humanitarian mission Operation Restore Hope. Britain remained
the second-largest aid donor, and the RAF had helped with the airlift, he
told MPs.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Peers criticise leasehold bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans for leasehold reform came under attack from all sides
yesterday, as the House of Lords began debating the bill to give certain
long-leaseholders in flats the right to join together to buy the freehold of
their block.
Criticism from peers that the proposals were too generous towards tenants
had been widely expected, but concern was also expressed by others that the
bill would not improve tenants' rights.
Tory backbench peers suggesting changes dominated the debate. As in the
Commons, the prospect of forcing government concessions will be greater
where there is an alliance of Tory backbenchers and opposition parties than
where it depends on Tory rebels alone.
Some Tory peers were clearly sensitive to the charge that they were speaking
in support of the large landlords, and underlined the impact the bill could
have on a small freeholder living in a block he or she owns. The Duke of
Westminster, London's leading landowner, listened to the debate but did not
take part.
The Lords do not pass amendments that would wreck legislation pledged in the
election. However, Lord Boardman, a Tory backbencher, emphasised that the
bill went beyond the Tory manifesto promise to improve the rights of
resident long-leaseholders.
Other Tory backbenchers pressed the case for widening the categories of
leaseholders entitled to have their leases extended. Under the plans, a
leaseholder in a block of flats which qualifies for enfranchisement is not
entitled to a lease extension, even if the tenants in the block do not buy
the freehold.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: 'Skill shortages' fuelled steep
1980s pay rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKILL shortages caused the rapid increase in pay during the tight labour
market of the late 1980s, not successful union bargaining, according to the
economic department of the Trades Union Congress.
Mr Bill Callaghan, head of the department, said yesterday at a pay seminar
organised by the Employment Policy Institute: 'Pay premia for scarce skilled
workers reflected a failure to train rather than a success of union
bargaining.'
Mr Callaghan said decentralisation of bargaining may have benefited unions
in the short term but initiatives were still needed to allow unions and
employers to take a longer-term view on pay.
'The collective bargaining outcomes of the past decade have not been ones
that the unions would find acceptable,' he said. Those who have received the
largest pay increases have not been union members, he added.
Mr Callaghan did not rule out a return to an incomes policy in 1994 or 1995
as an alternative to higher interest rates or big cuts in public spending.
He said the government had already 'crossed the Rubicon' with its public
sector pay policy.
Pay restraint in the private and public sectors should make unions
concentrate on employment protection and creation and on the improvement of
training and equal opportunities, he said. 'In the public sector there may
be scope for a co-ordinated approach on employment stability as the number
one bargaining objective.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith set to spell out vote stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, is expected today to indicate the extent
to which he still backs the principle of 'one-member-one-vote' when the
party's National Executive Committee debates Labour's links with trade
unions, Ralph Atkins writes.
Mr Smith, who backed the principle during his campaign for the party
leadership last summer, will respond to a review group's interim report on
options for reducing Labour's trade union links.
A proposal for 'associate membership' for trade union members has been
opposed by Mr Neil Kinnock, former Labour leader, who supports
one-member-one-vote.
Decisions are expected to be put forward by the NEC for approval at the
party conference after consultations with party members.
The review group has proposed an end to the union block vote at conference
and the eventual introduction of one-member-one-vote for the selection of
candidates and election of the party leader. But Mr Smith faces pressure
from unions for a strong link.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Juvenile crime measures pledged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major yesterday promised new measures 'very shortly' to deal with
juvenile crime, while emphasising that responsibility for addressing the
problem 'spreads far beyond any government.'
Challenged at prime minister's questions, Mr Major included the family,
churches and schools among institutions with a duty to help stem the problem
of persistent young offenders. Children who played truant were 'far more
likely to be involved in juvenile crime,' he said.
His remarks came after the form the new measures would take was discussed in
cabinet. Officials said no conclusions were reached, however, due partly to
differences over where the money to fund a new programme would come from.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Council contracts out its exchequer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Borough of Bromley is to contract out most of its exchequer
department in the largest out-sourcing contract signed for local government
financial services.
The contract has been won by Capita Managed Services, a subsidiary of the
fast-growing Capita Group.
The value of the contract is Pounds 24m over five years, four times larger
than the previous largest contract for such services. It is expected to save
the council Pounds 1m, according to Mr David Bartlett, Bromley's borough
treasurer.
The 170 staff will be transferred to Capita on their existing terms and
conditions. The company plans to set up a centre in Bromley to provide
services to public-sector organisations throughout the south-east, including
councils, NHS trust hospitals and grant-maintained schools.
Capita will take over the collection of council tax and national
non-domestic rates. There will be performance-related payments if it meets
targets for revenue collection.
The contract also covers the payment of salaries to the council's 10,000
workforce and the administration of pensions. Other financial services in
the package include the payment of councillors' allowances.
Payment of housing benefit and council tax benefit will also be
administered. Capita is the only out-sourcing company to have taken over the
payment of these benefits. The first such contract was won in East
Cambridgeshire last spring.
Three companies were shortlisted for the contract secured by Capita, and all
presented their plans to the workforce. Capita won the greatest backing in a
ballot of staff, 98 per cent of whom endorsed the decision to contract out.
Mr Bartlett said: 'This move will help us to protect the position of our
employees, whose work is shrinking as schools opt out and we contract out
other functions. If they are in the private sector, they can bid for other
contracts in the very large public and private sector market for these
services.
'It also fits with our strategy of turning Bromley into an enabling
authority. By contracting out work such as financial services, we can
provide a more cost-effective service for residents.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Euro-rebels to promote phone poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ORGANISERS of Dial for Democracy, the telephone referendum on the
Maastricht treaty, are to advertise in newspapers in an effort to encourage
greater participation, David Owen writes.
The advertisements, which the organisers plan to place in local papers such
as the Evening Standard in London, would be designed to lift the number of
callers to about the 100,000 mark.
Since the poll was launched to great fanfare with the help of Baroness
Thatcher in Westminster three weeks ago more than 50,000 calls have been
received. But backers are so far giving no indication of which way callers
are voting.
The organisers hope the exercise will both build a picture of how the
British electorate would vote and increase pressure on the government for a
real referendum.
Since the launch one national newspaper - The Sun - has regularly carried
the two 0891 numbers which eligible voters are invited to dial. The
two-minute calls cost 48p per minute outside cheap rates.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Rosyth shipyard sheds 550 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS AT the Rosyth naval dockyard in Fife, who have been anxiously
awaiting a government decision on the location of future submarine work,
were yesterday surprised by the announcement of 550 redundancies among the
4,100-strong labour force.
The news came just two weeks after the Ministry of Defence made clear it
intended to keep Rosyth and the rival facility at Devonport in Plymouth
open, irrespective of which yard won the battle to become the UK's sole
refitter of submarines.
The decision on the submarine work, which both yards consider crucial, has
been postponed several times and is not expected for some weeks.
Devonport has repeatedly said that, since the two yards were placed under
private-sector management in 1987, it had shed more than 6,000 jobs compared
with fewer than 2,000 lost at Rosyth.
Rosyth, managed by the Babcock Thorn consortium, said the latest
redundancies were unconnected with the contest. It blamed the measure mainly
on reductions in the scope of work required on recent navy refitting
contracts.
Although no contracts had been taken away, they were affected by pressure on
naval support expenditure, it said.
Labour defence spokesman, George Foulkes, said Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the
defence secretary, should bring forward the date of the announcement and end
the uncertainty for both dockyards: 'This has dragged on for too long and
these latest job losses are a direct result of the government's dithering.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / Pensioners set to exceed forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of people over retirement age will be much higher in the next
century than had previously been forecast, according to new figures from the
1991 census.
Numbers in England and Wales over pension age will reach 14m by 2029, 9 per
cent higher than the 1989 forecast of 12.8m. The proportion of people aged
75 and over will be 18 per cent higher than forecast in 1989, at 5.9m.
This will further increase the age dependency ratio - the number of retired
people as a proportion of those of working age.
At present this stands at 30 for every 100 people of working age and is set
to rise by 2029 to 45 per 100, compared with the 1989 projection of 41.
Overall, the population of the UK will go on increasing slowly from 57.6m in
1991 to 62.1m in 2031, then fall with increasing rapidity, dropping below
the 1991 level by 2061.
For England and Wales the number of children under 16 is projected to
increase by about 7 per cent between 1991 and 2001. The number will then
decrease slowly until 2020, levelling out subsequently at 10.2m.
The population of working age will grow by 6 per cent between 1991 and 2011,
and then fall 7 per cent over the following 20 years.
Within this group, however, the numbers under 30 will fall rapidly for the
rest of the century and are not expected to return to the current level in
the next 40 years.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Motor trade deficit soars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRADE deficit in the motor industry almost trebled last year to Pounds
2.8bn from Pounds 1bn in 1991 under the impact of a sharp rise in the value
of imports.
Automotive products ac-counted for a fifth of the total UK visible trade
deficit of Pounds 13.8bn and for more than a third of the Pounds 7.6bn
deficit last year on manufacturing exports.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said it was 'likely to be
some time' before the full effects of sterling's devaluation would be felt
in the industry's trade balance.
Devaluation had enhanced the competitiveness of UK products, it said, but
exporters had been unable to take full advantage of the improvement 'because
of the contraction in many of the main UK export markets'.
The value of motor industry exports rose by 3 per cent last year to almost
Pounds 11.1bn, but was overshadowed by an 18 per cent rise in the value of
imports to almost Pounds 13.9bn.
In the final quarter of the year the motor industry trade balance fell into
a deficit of Pounds 226m compared with the short-lived surplus of Pounds
121m achieved in the corresponding period a year earlier, the first
quarterly trade surplus since the early 1980s.
The society said the recent trend in exports of automotive products had been
'more encouraging' with an 11 per cent increase in the value of export
earnings in the final quarter to Pounds 3.2bn.
But this improvement was also offset by an acceleration in the value of
imported automotive products in the final quarter, which rose by 24 per cent
to Pounds 3.4bn.
There was a sharp improvement in car exports in the final quarter of last
year with a 34 per cent rise in value to Pounds 1.4bn and a 22 per cent
year-on-year increase in volume.
For the whole of last year the value of car exports rose by 5 per cent to
Pounds 4.06bn, but the volume of exports declined by 3 per cent.
The improvement in the final quarter reflected in particular higher exports
by Vauxhall, the General Motors subsidiary, and by Nissan, the Japanese
carmaker, which started production last autumn of a second model range at
its Sunderland assembly plant.
The deterioration in the motor industry trade balance last year and in the
final quarter was caused above all by the sharp increase in the value and
volume of imports of cars and parts and accessories.
Car imports rose by 20 per cent in value to Pounds 6.5bn and by 15 per cent
in volume to 942,020. The value of imports of parts and accessories rose by
16 per cent to Pounds 6bn.
Exports of parts and accessories rose by 4 per cent to nearly Pounds 5bn.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Doleful days for young jobless: Fears that an 'underclass'
is being created
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST YEAR 20-year-old Diana Blackwood was unemployed and frustrated. 'I kept
thinking there is some job out there I could be doing - how do I set about
doing it? Is it my lack of qualifications or what?'
The 18-24 age group which Ms Blackwood falls into showed one of the highest
increases in long-term joblessness, although Ms Blackwood, a single parent,
has just come off the register because she has gone on a childcare training
scheme.
Long-term unemployment among 18-19-year-olds rose by 51 per cent in the year
to January, while for the 18-24 age group as a whole the increase was 42.5
per cent. The overall increase was 38 per cent.
The 18-24 age group is seen by the government and bodies including the
Confederation of British Industry as probably the most vulnerable among the
long-term unemployed. They believe that new initiatives must be aimed at
them. One of the options is compulsory training or work experience.
Many, however, finish Youth Training, the main scheme for 16-18-year-olds,
with no qualifications. The scheme has a deteriorating record of getting
people into jobs - from a peak of 68 per cent in 1989 to about 50 per cent
now.
Providers of training say many long-term unemployed in this age group have
failed to benefit from school or training.
Mr John Philpott, of the Employment Policy Institute, an independent think
tank, said: 'Around a fifth of the long-term unemployed are between 18 and
24, many of whom have not worked at all or only irregularly. Yet this is
precisely the group in whom the habit of work needs to be instilled if they
are to become active citizens. There is a clear danger that many such
individuals may be lost permanently from the labour market if nothing is
done to change their situation.'
Mr Philpott says economists see this age group as the best-placed to get a
job when the recession ends - but he argues that it is also the age group
most susceptible to becoming a British 'underclass'.
Eighteen is the peak age for male offenders, although those dealing with
young offenders say there are no direct causal links between crime and
long-term unemployment.
However, Ms Vivien Stern, director of the National Association for Care and
Resettlement of Offenders, says: 'Studies in the US suggest that
unemployment has consequences that lead to the loosening of the social
controls that prevent crime.' These include a decline in loyalty, family
pressures, respect for other people and in hope.
Ms Blackwood said: 'Most of my friends are on the dole. They know it's
really difficult to get a job and some of them cannot be bothered to fight
for one.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / BA and Virgin close to settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways and Virgin Atlantic last night appeared to be moving towards
an agreement intended to end their 'dirty tricks' battle and to lift the
threat of a further, protracted legal fight.
After a day of talks in London which continued into the night - well beyond
the 24-hour deadline for agreement set on Monday by Virgin - Mr Richard
Branson, the head of Virgin, said there were signs of a breakthrough.
Mr Branson said he was more optimistic that the two sides could reach
agreement, although 'stumbling blocks' remained.
Virgin last month won Pounds 610,000 in libel damages from BA and a public
apology, following revelations that BA had been engaged in covert operations
to undermine Virgin's business.
BA last night made an offer in response to Mr Branson's demands for cash
compensation for the commercial damage inflicted on his airline by BA. Mr
Branson said: 'They have put some money on the table, finally, to pay for
the people they have taken from us.' Although the sum Virgin has sought has
never been disclosed it is thought to be about Pounds 25m.
Virgin has also been seeking a legally binding agreement from BA that it
will not repeat its activities against its smaller competitor. Mr Branson
indicated last night that this issue was still causing disagreement. BA, he
said, was still suggesting that it should be able to talk to Virgin
passengers to persuade them to upgrade to Concorde flights.
Allegations earlier this week that some BA employees in the US were
encouraging Virgin passengers to switch airlines placed a further strain on
relations between the companies.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Fraud against companies rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of fraud perpetrated against British companies has nearly trebled
in five year to more than Pounds 468m in 1992, figures released yesterday by
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick show.
KPMG's 'fraud barometer' says total reported fraud was Pounds 1.6bn from
1987 to 1992, covering 349 separate incidents.
The figures are based on newspaper reports of fraud charges above Pounds
100,000 brought to UK courts. Any case with a not-guilty verdict is removed
from the records.
Mr Philip Haberman, a partner from the firm's forensic accounting unit, said
it was unclear whether the increase represented a jump in the number of
frauds or a rise in the level of detection.
But he said reported frauds probably represented less than 10 per cent of
total frauds. Many companies were reluctant to publicise frauds and others
did not have sufficient evidence to bring prosecutions.
He said there did not seem to be a particular increase in frauds related to
the recession, although a lot more had been revealed as a result of the
effects of the recession.
The largest amount of fraud in the last five years - nearly a third of the
total - was in the banking and finance sectors, such as forged cheques and
mortgage fraud.
A further 29 per cent were in commercial companies and 15 per cent were
against the public, including investors. Other areas included social
security and legal aid frauds.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Battersea Power Station sale expected soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BATTERSEA Power Station, the derelict south London landmark, is expected to
be sold soon to a Hong Kong property family in a deal negotiated with the
banking syndicate that backed the failed scheme to turn the site into a
leisure complex.
Representatives of Mr George and Mr Victor Hwang, the brothers who are
leading negotiations on behalf of their family, said that contracts had been
exchanged between the brothers and the banks.
This was confirmed by Mr John Broome, whose company, Battersea Leisure, owns
the 31-acre site but details of how ownership would be transferred remained
unclear. He said last night that the brothers were 'buying the bank debt'
but said the brothers' statement yesterday that the deal was to acquire the
power station and site 'means the same thing'.
He said: 'The exact position is that they have bought into my syndicate bank
position and I am involved with them on that level and many other levels.'
As one of the brothers was due to fly in today to complete the deal, their
spokeswoman said that they had made no guarantees that Mr Broome would
continue to be involved in the development. She said: 'The deal has not been
finally concluded although it's very, very close.'
Mr Broome said he would be coming out of the deal clear of debts on the
site. The bank debt, he said, was probably being sold at a discount.
The listed art deco power station has been the focus of a long-running
debate about its future amid the concerns of local residents that it was in
danger of falling into an irreparable state of decay.
The announcement appears to have surprised both Wandsworth Council and
English Heritage, the government-funded conservation body, which together
have the power to veto any proposed planning alterations to the listed
building.
The Hwangs are controlling shareholders in the Hong Kong Parkview Group,
which developed and built the Hong Kong Parkview Complex in Tai Tam, one of
the colony's prime residential developments, valued at more than Pounds 1bn.
The group's interests cover property, hospitality and leisure, transport and
energy.
The spokeswoman stressed that the deal was being negotiated with the family
and not with Hong Kong Parkview, but could not give details how the sale was
being structured.
Mr Broome said he had been personally involved in the negotiations, but it
is understood that the main negotiations have been with the consortium of
banks led by Bank of America, which originally backed Mr Broome's project to
develop the power station into a leisure complex. Work on the site stopped
after the banks refused further finance when projected development costs
overshot by Pounds 60m to Pounds 230m.

FT  24 FEB 93 / BAe sells stake in truck group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE has severed its ownership link with Daf through the sale
of its 10.9 per cent stake in the failed Dutch truckmaker for a nominal sum.
The BAe holding in Daf had become almost worthless following the
truckmaker's collapse into receivership three weeks ago.
In information filed with the stock exchanges in Amsterdam and London, Daf
said that BAe had sold its entire holding of 10.9 per cent of the Daf issued
share capital via the Amsterdam stock exchange to unknown buyers.
BAe confirmed the share disposal last night and said that it had received
only a 'modest amount'.
Mr Friso Meeter, one of Daf's two Dutch receivers, said earlier this week
that shareholders in the old Daf would not receive anything for their
shares.
'It is definite that shareholders will not have a turn' when it came to
dividing the company's assets, he said.
The core heavy truck manufacturing operations of the old Daf company in the
Netherlands and in Belgium are to be transferred later this week into a
newly capitalised company Daf Trucks NV.
BAe announces today its 1992 financial results, which will include an amount
for the write-down of its Daf stake.
Overall BAe has done well out of the 40 per cent stake in Daf it acquired in
1988 when it took over Rover for Pounds 150m. In 1989 it disposed of more
than half of the Daf stake for Fl 321m (Pounds 90m).

FT  24 FEB 93 / Lawyers warn on shortage of judges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHORTAGE of Commercial Court judges is threatening London's future as a
centre for resolving international business disputes, the heads of the legal
profession say.
A letter to Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, from Mr Mark Sheldon,
president of the Law Society, and Mr John Rowe QC, chairman of the Bar,
warns that at stake is the Pounds 450m contributed by English commercial law
to invisible foreign earnings each year.
The normal complement of Commercial Court judges is six. At present there
are only five. The problem is made worse because a general shortage of High
Court judges means that the five commercial judges are frequently required
to sit in other divisions of the High Court.

BASIC SALARIES for international bank employees in the City rose by just 0.9
per cent last year. But when bonuses are included the rise was 2.9 per cent,
say pay consultants Day Associates, Diane Summers writes.
The survey of more than 120 international banks and investment banks found:
A drop in basic salaries in the capital markets sector of 2.7 per cent. But
bonuses produced an overall earnings increase of 2.9 per cent.
Fund management staff did better than other groups, with a basic increase of
3.6 per cent - 6.4 per cent with bonuses.
Back-office salaries rose 1.5 per cent - 3.6 per cent with bonuses.
There was little movement in pay for corporate finance and legal jobs.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Daf vans buy-out seeks state funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFORMAL TALKS have started on possible government funding for the
prospective management buy-out team at the threatened Leyland Daf van plant
at Washwood Heath, Birmingham, Mr Michael Heseltine said yesterday.
Speaking in Birmingham, the trade and industry secretary said that the talks
about funding through the regional selective assistance scheme had been
between the van plant management and department officials.
He ruled out government finance to meet the day-to-day losses of the plant.
'Companies come to us for help in capital projects and it is in this context
that assistance is available,' he said.
Regional selective assistance is available under the Industrial Development
Act 1982 for companies in Britain's assisted areas.
To qualify for funding projects must cover either new ventures and
expansions which create employment, or modernisation and rationalisation
schemes which safeguard existing employment.
The administrative receivers for Leyland Daf said yesterday that they had
made a breakthrough in agreeing financing arrangements to allow dealers to
re-start sales to customers.
Sales have been hampered since the company collapsed into receivership three
weeks ago by legal problems over the ownership of vehicles in dealer
showrooms and in the supply pipeline.
Technically, most of the vehicles at dealerships are owned by Leyland Daf
Finance, which is not in receivership.
Leyland Daf Finance, a subsidiary of Daf Finance in the Netherlands, was
responsible before the collapse of Daf for much of the dealer stock
financing and customer hire purchase and leasing arrangements.
The UK receivers said yesterday that the arrangements would permit dealers
to continue supplying Leyland Daf vehicles to customers.
Mr David Gill, joint managing director of Leyland Daf, said that vehicles in
the supply pipeline, many of which had confirmed customer orders, could now
be sold. Dealers would be able to resume trading 'in a conventional way'.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Ford launches Pounds 200m R&amp;D expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD of Europe is launching a five-year programme to expand its research and
development centre at Dunton, Essex, at a cost of Pounds 200m.
The programme, disclosed by Mr John Oldfield, Ford of Europe's
vice-president for product programmes, vehicle engineering and design, is
expected to create up to 500 more jobs at Dunton, which is the largest motor
industry centre for R&amp;D in the UK.
But the jobs are expected to be filled by existing Ford employees moving
from nearby satellite research operations at Aveley, Basildon and Dagenham.
Last year Ford announced its intention to restructure all its European R&amp;D
operations, consolidating them at Dunton and at a similarly sized operation
at Merkenich, near Cologne in Germany.
Under this consolidation it was intended that a total of 1,200 engineering
staff would eventually move to Dunton from the three satellite plants. The
influx would lift Dunton's total establishment to 4,000, from the current
3,000.
Although not formally confirmed by Ford management last night, it is this
process that appears to be getting under way .
In spite of no new jobs being created, the Dunton expansion should finally
set to rest fears which began circulating early last year that Ford might be
considering closing Dunton and moving all its research and development
activities to Germany.
At that time Ford said it was transferring about 20 to 30 jobs from Germany
to the UK. In Germany, about 1,300 staff were relocated to Merkenich from
other sites in Cologne.
Mr Oldfield said at the time that Ford was seeking to bring together design
and production engineers at one site so that 'we can achieve better
communication and teamwork and thereby generate significant quality and
efficiency gains'.

FT  24 FEB 93 / EC computer security breached by schoolboy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SCHOOLBOY computer hacker breached security surrounding computer networks
at EC headquarters in Luxembourg, the Financial Times in London, European
medical organisations involved in research and treatment of cancer, and
universities, a court heard yesterday.
Such was Mr Paul Bedworth's level of illegal activity that he was unable to
pay his phone bill, British Telecommunications cut him off, and he then used
his mother's telephone line, Mr James Richardson, prosecuting, told
Southwark Crown Court.
Other hackers faced similar charges. Mr Richardson said Mr Bedworth, now 19,
who carried out his computer forays using a Pounds 200 microcomputer, was
caught when Leeds University set up a data line monitor after the level of
illegal activity on their system became so great genuine users could not
access it.
At one stage, claimed Mr Richardson, Mr Bedworth said he obtained access to
a Lloyds Bank computer. Another hacker replied he was not into stealing
cash.
'There is no suggestion that any of these had any part in fraud but the
effect that access was gained to banks demonstrates the dangers of what they
were doing and the nuisance value of what they were doing,' said Mr
Richardson.
Mr Bedworth pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to obtain telecommunication
services dishonestly, the unauthorised modification of computers and
unauthorised access of computer material.
Mr Karl Strickland, 22, unemployed, of Liverpool, and Mr Neil Woods, 26,
unemployed, of Oldham, admitted conspiracy to obtain telecommunication
services dishonestly and plotting in the unauthorised publication of
material under the Telecommunications Act 1984.
The trial was adjourned until today.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Lawyers warn on shortage of judges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHORTAGE of Commercial Court judges is threatening London's future as a
centre for resolving international business disputes, the heads of the legal
profession say.
In a letter to Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, Mr Mark Sheldon, president
of the Law Society, and Mr John Rowe QC, chairman of the Bar, warn that at
stake is the Pounds 450m contribution made by English commercial law to
invisible foreign earnings each year.
Delays in hearing international business disputes because of a lack of
judges and uncertainty about their future availability could drive
international clients of the Commercial Court to litigate in other
commercial law centres such as Rotterdam or Frankfurt, they say.
International businesses use the London court by choice largely because of
its ability to offer fixed hearing dates within a reasonable time.
'Businesses need to be able to plan ahead, to allocate the time of
management and other witnesses,' Mr Sheldon says.
The normal complement of Commercial Court judges is six. At the moment there
are only five. But the problem is made worse because a general shortage of
High Court judges means that the five commercial judges are frequently
required to sit on cases in other divisions of the High Court.
Mr Justice Saville, the head of the Commercial Court, wants a full
complement of six judges and for them all to sit full time on Commercial
Court cases.
The lord chancellor is considering a report by a working party chaired by Mr
Justice Kennedy on judicial staffing in the High Court.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Women at Freemans win equal pay case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEMALE warehouse workers at Freemans, the mail order company, yesterday won
an industrial tribunal case in an equal pay claim that has been running more
than eight years.
Since October 1984 aspects of the case have been heard at industrial
tribunals, the Employment Appeal Tribunal, the Court of Appeal and the House
of Lords.
The Equal Opportunities Commission, which is backing the women, said the
case demonstrated the need for legislation on equal pay to be simplified. It
has been calling for sex discrimination and equal pay laws to be replaced
with a single equal treatment act and said this would 'stop women having to
undergo such lengthy ordeals in order to get equal pay'.
Mrs Rene Pickstone, who brought the action with four colleagues, worked at
Freemans' Peterborough base where catalogues and goods are assembled and
despatched. As 'warehouse operatives' they were claiming their work was of
equal value to that of a male 'checker warehouse operative' who, in 1985,
earned Pounds 5.85 more pay a week.
The tribunal yesterday accepted an independent expert's view that the
difference between the jobs was not 'one which in the real world can be
regarded as a material difference'.
Freemans said after the ruling it had worked closely with unions and had
been conscientious in establishing 'true values for the many different
employee grades'.
The company might appeal against the tribunal decision.

FT  24 FEB 93 / NatWest denies free banking set to end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD ALEXANDER, chairman of National Westminster Bank, yesterday insisted
that his bank had no immediate plan to end 'free' banking for personal
customers who remain in credit.
Lord Alexander however said he supported the principle that banks should end
internal subsidies to forms of business which make a loss. One bank has
estimated that up to 80 per cent of its personal accounts operate at a loss.
Lord Alexander said at the presentation of the bank's full-year results for
1992: 'In principle, the banking industry has to aim for a situation where
it gives good services and receives a fair price with a minimum of
cross-subsidies.'
His remarks follow a warning from Sir Nicholas Goodison, president of the
British Bankers' Association, that efforts to end internal subsidies were
likely to put 'free' banking at risk.
In spite of speculation that NatWest could be the first bank to introduce
such charges, Lord Alexander said: 'We have no current plans to introduce
charges for personal customers whose accounts are in credit.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / When trust is at a premium: Criticisms of how the insurance
sector tackles fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S insurers, slowly emerging from two years of the worst trading
conditions in their history, were attacked yesterday for failing to address
properly the problem of insurance fraud.
The criticism by Mr Julian Farrand, the industry's ombudsman, has
highlighted the difficulties of dealing with what has become a growing
problem during the recession.
In his annual report for 1992 Mr Farrand said: 'It does seem that insurers
may carry a measure of responsibility for encouraging fraudsters to believe
that insurance fraud is easy to get away with.'
Last year the Association of British Insurers, the industry trade body,
launched an advertising campaign in an attempt to reduce fraudulent claims,
which it said cost the industry more than Pounds 400m in 1991.
When the campaign was launched last June the association estimated that 12
per cent of claims were fraudulent. Ten per cent of claims were inflated
while 2 per cent were completely fraudulent.
Subsequently the Chartered Institute of Loss Adjusters said that at least
one in four household claims is inflated fraudulently, and advised insurance
companies to strengthen procedures for investigating claims.
Last month Mr Bev Fitzgerald, of the institute, said: 'There is a feeling
among the public that 'I'd be daft not to'.'
While acknowledging the association campaign Mr Farrand said that actions
spoke louder than words and that insurers did not always seem to 'help
themselves or their honest policyholders as much as they should'. He said
that because of the difficulty in proving fraud, many insurers were inclined
to find something 'in the small print' as a basis to reject a claim.
Mr Farrand said that it was 'negative' simply to repudiate a claim. Without
positive action by insurers, fraudsters would simply 'move on to the next
unsuspecting insurer', he said. Insurers should not 'pass the buck' to the
bureau but should investigate a case properly before allowing it to come to
the insurance ombudsman.
The bureau 'cannot be expected to support unsubstantiated accusations
against policyholders', said Mr Farrand, 'by for instance 'reading between
the lines' as some insurers put it'.
Yesterday the association said the situation was changing as a result of its
campaign and insurance companies were showing an increased determination to
prosecute for fraud.
The association said too many people did not appreciate that a successful
fraudulent claim would eventually be paid for by policyholders through
increased premiums. It said, however, insurers faced a number of practical
diffi-culties. 'Proving fraud is difficult when you are relying on trust as
the basis of the contract.'
Companies meanwhile responded to the ombudsman's accusations by stressing
the practical difficulties of proving fraud.
Royal Insurance said: 'It is true that too many people regard insurance
companies as fair game. We're aware of it but the problem is that the burden
of proof rests with us. You have to have evidence and that can be difficult
to get hold of.'
Mr Bob Scott, general manager of General Accident UK, rejected Mr Farrand's
comments and insisted that his company was making progress in tackling
fraud.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Government urged to curb regulators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGULATION of privatised utilities has reached a crisis and the government
should include a new list of principles for their regulation in a white
paper, Mr Dieter Helm, director of Oxford Economic Research Associates, said
yesterday.
Mr Helm, a consultant to the energy industry, has added his voice to growing
calls for the reform of regulation. 'We've given regulators enormous
discretion over the utilities without the appropriate accountability,' he
said.
He called for the merger of the gas and electricity industry regulators
Ofgas and Offer, as the two industries were now so interdependent.
Mr Helm, speaking at the launch of the group's utility index, which tracks
the performance of UK utilities, said there should be considerable
restraints placed on the powers of the regulators.
'Regulatory behaviour and uncertainty over regulation is increasingly a cost
to the utilities. Investors need protection from regulators using their
discriminatory powers,' he said.
Mr Helm stressed that the problem for regulators was that prices to
customers which were set at privatisation - for supplying gas, electricity
and water and providing telecommunications services - were often too low to
encourage competing companies into the market. 'Regulators face the
inconsistency of the need for high prices on the one hand to encourage
competition, but the pressure to keep prices low on the other hand to
protect consumers.'
The utility index provides a record of the financial performance of the
utilities, weighting them by the size of their core utility business and
excluding their diversified interests.
The consultants believe it will be a useful tool for regulators and
investors.
Mr John Dorken, deputy director of Ofgas, said he did not feel the need for
greater co-ordination with Offer. 'They are separate industries with some
interactions, but those are not so great as to imply the need for a single
regulator.'
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the director-general of Offer, agrees with
Ofgas that regulation should be separate for both industries. 'The gas and
electricity markets are distinct and at different stages in their evolution
towards competition.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / Littlechild warning to power generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Stephen Little-child, the electricity regulator, yesterday warned
he might try to increase his powers over the industries' two main generators
 -or refer them to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission - if he found they
failed to pass the fall in the price of coal to consumers.
He was speaking after publishing a report which disappointed supporters of
the coal lobby by approving the decisions of regional electricity companies
to buy gas from new stations which they are helping to build.
The report was welcomed by the regional companies but criticised by the
generators, who found 'serious flaws' in the report's analysis. National
Power and PowerGen, the main generators in England and Wales, said they were
confident the prices in their contracts with the regional companies for
coal-fired power were fully justified.
Prof Littlechild's investigation into the generators' margins and costs in
their coal and other contracts might cast a shadow over the companies for
some time. He said 'immediate and unambiguous answers to questions about
their future profitability' were not likely. He was still seeking
information from the two companies, he added.
Although the regional distribution companies were relieved by the
regulator's approval of the gas contracts, there is concern about his
examination of the application of yardstick price controls to them. This
could mean that, if gas stations did not prove to be the cheapest source of
electricity available during the period of the contracts, the regional
companies would have difficulty in passing the costs to customers.
Prof Littlechild said he was looking for a form of price control that
provided a sharper incentive to the regional companies to purchase
economically. One form of yardstick would mean that the companies would only
be able to pass on average costs incurred by all the sector.
Alternatively there could be an index related to fuel costs rather than
electricity costs.
Prof Littlechild said that whatever was decided it would not be appropriate
to apply yardsticks to the five-year coal deals already agreed tentatively
between British Coal, the generators and the regional companies. This will
be a relief to the government, which wants the tentative contracts to
underpin any deal it comes up with to rescue some of the 31 UK pits
threatened with closure. In clearing the regional companies in their 'dash
for gas' Prof Littlechild said that on average contracts with independent
gas stations accounted for 17 per cent to 18 per cent of requirements for
electricity between 1995 and 1998.
Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen chief executive, said his company remained
unconvinced of Prof Littlechild's analysis. 'In our view he still does not
do justice to our coal-backed offer.' More than 300 jobs are to go in
Gloucestershire with the closure of the Meco Mining Equipment factory near
Tewkesbury, it was announced yesterday.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Gas plan 'may force prices up'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAS Consumers' Council said yesterday that prices for domestic consumers
could rise if the Monopolies and Mergers Commission forced British Gas to
sell its pipelines and storage arm as proposed by Ofgas, the industry
regulator.
Mr James Cooper, chairman of the Gas Consumers' Council, said in a letter to
the commission, which is reviewing the structure of British Gas's business:
'The council is not convinced that consumers will gain more from total
divestment in the manner that Ofgas has recommended.'
The consumers' council, which represents the interests of customers, said
Ofgas's proposals threatened price stability to industry, commerce and
householders throughout Britain.
British Gas has already agreed with the Office of Fair Trading to put its
transportation division into a separate subsidiary. But Ofgas believes true
competition will not be achieved until the pipelines business is under
separate ownership.
Mr Cooper said: 'I think Ofgas runs the risk of jeopardising some of the
tremendous achievements it has made, such as the 'RPI minus 5' pricing
formula.' The tough formula restricts British Gas's price increases to 5
percentage points below the rate of inflation for the next five years, which
means price cuts when inflation falls below 5 per cent.
Mr Cooper said the council was greatly concerned about how a residual gas
trading company, acting on its own and with few assets, would maintain the
service to consumers that an integrated British Gas now provided.
The sale of the pipelines business would leave a gas trading company that
might not be able to meet its supply obligations, Mr Cooper said. 'These
changes are irreversible, it can't just be changed back if it doesn't work.'
He said he was not necessarily against the sale of the pipelines business.
'What we're trying to say is: prove to us that it's a good idea.'
Mr Cooper also said he had yet to receive any proof from Ofgas that its
proposals would benefit consumers. 'The package consumers have, which gives
British Gas a supply obligation and keeps prices low, is a good one and we
want some pretty strong proof that anything that puts that at risk will be
better for consumers.'
Ofgas, however, believes more competition means more choice for consumers.
Mr John Dorken, deputy director of Ofgas, said: 'I don't see that it
necessarily leads to an increase in prices.'
Ofgas wanted to spell out the way forward for the industry, said Mr Dorken,
and not move in a piecemeal way. 'The Gas Consumers' Council is taking a
slower, more cautious approach,' he said.
The regulator is due to make a further announcement next week about the
future of British Gas, including the way pipelines could be separated from
the rest of the company.

FT  24 FEB 93 / EC says Britain can ban porn TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government has the power to take immediate action against Red Hot
Dutch, the pornographic TV channel transmitted to Britain via satellite from
Denmark, a top European Commission official said yesterday.
Mrs Colette Flesch, director-general of the EC's audio visual, information,
communication and culture group, told a Financial Times conference in
London: 'We in the Commission firmly believe that the UK authorities have
the means to suspend and stop such a broadcast.'
Red Hot Dutch, which recently changed its name to Red Hot Television,
broadcasts after midnight to a subscription-paying domestic audience. It is,
however, unlicensed in the UK although it is believed to have 25,000
subscribers around the country.
Speaking at the FT Cable and Satellite conference, Mrs Flesch said the
Commission regarded Red Hot Dutch as being effectively established in the
UK.
'So far as we are concerned the situation seems clear. It's up to the
responsible authorities (in the UK) to take whatever steps they consider
right and applicable,' she said.
The government said yesterday that it was actively exploring ways of taking
action against the pornography channel but that it did not share Mrs
Flesch's interpretation of the EC directive. If the British government
decides it has the power to take action against Red Hot Television under UK
law it could take action against those supplying the decoders and other
services in the UK.
The subscriptions and the decoders, which unscramble transmissions for
fee-paying viewers, are sold by Continental Television, a Manchester-based
company registered in the Netherlands and licensed by Continental Television
BVio, a Dutch registered channel.
Lawyers for Continental Television have written to the National Heritage
Department threatening legal action if any action is taken to suppress Red
Hot Television.
The letter argues that Community law has already decided that freedom of
communication within the Community requires that any restrictions be imposed
by the country from which broadcasts are transmitted.
Under the European directive on cross-frontier broadcasting, it was assumed
it is legal to broadcast any channel that is acceptable to the country from
which the signal originates.
Separately, Sir George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television
Commission, told the conference that an early re-advertisement of a Channel
5 licence under similar terms to last time was an option that had not been
ruled out.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Fall in confidence shrugged off: US outlook is still bright,
economists say
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economic outlook remains bright in spite of an unexpected fall in
consumer confidence this month, economists said yesterday.
The Conference Board said its closely-followed index of consumer confidence
fell 8 points to 68.5 this month. This followed a smaller dip in confidence
in January.
Most analysts, however, brushed off the figures, pointing out that the
survey was conducted during the wobbly initial weeks of the Clinton
administration, when the focus was on divisive issues such as gays in the
military and the search for an attorney general.
The successful launch last week of President Bill Clinton's deficit-cutting
economic package is expected to shore up confidence in March.
Many forecasters now expect the Commerce Department to revise up its
estimate of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of last year to
show growth at an annual rate of nearer 5 per cent than the 3.8 per cent
initially reported.
This would reflect new data showing a higher level of corporate inventories,
a stronger trade performance and more buoyant consumer spending than
previously estimated.
However, the consensus view is still that growth will decelerate somewhat in
the current quarter to an annual rate of about 3 per cent, reflecting a
cooling of consumption spending and weaker net exports as a result of the
economic slowdown in Europe and Japan.
Looking further ahead, however, the sharp recent decline in long bond yields
to below 7 per cent - a reflection of bond market approval of the
administration's plan to cut the deficit - is expected to stimulate growth
by sharply reducing the cost of servicing consumer and corporate debt.
Mr Fabian Linden, for the Conference Board, said the drop in confidence
mainly reflected apprehension about future prospects rather than current
economic conditions.
There had been a significant rise since January in the proportion of
respondents expecting conditions to worsen and jobs to become scarcer.
A rebound in confidence seems likely, however, because more recent polls
indicate strong initial confidence in the administration's plan to
strengthen the economy. In congressional testimony yesterday, Treasury
secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the plan provided an immediate stimulus and a
'down payment' on the longer-term investments that would create jobs.

MR Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, has put his tax team into place
with the nomination of Mr Leslie Samuels to be assistant secretary for tax
policy, and of Mrs Peggy Richardson to be commissioner of the Internal
Revenue Service, George Graham writes from Washington.
Mr Samuels is a partner with the New York law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb,
Steen and Hamilton. Mrs Richardson is a partner in the Washington office of
Sutherland, Asbill &amp; Brennan, specialising in tax and insurance regulation.
The appointments to the senior tax positions at the Treasury have been the
subject of considerable interest for foreign companies and tax specialists,
because of the recent attention which has been paid to issues of transfer
pricing and multinational taxation.
Washington lawyers said Mr Samuels was a widely respected practitioner with
an extensive background in foreign taxation issues.
In addition, he has worked closely before with some of Mr Bentsen's aides
from the Senate finance committee who have already been installed in the
second tier of the tax policy division.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Dark cloud of devaluation gathers over Mexico: Stephen
Fidler and Damian Fraser examine an issue increasingly preoccupying business
and government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE THE broad and widely-applauded economic reforms of the government of
President Carlos Salinas, concern about a devaluation over the next two
years is growing among Mexican bankers, businessmen and - though loath to
admit it - government officials.
'I've a lot of clients in the US and elsewhere and all they are talking
about is the exchange rate, the exchange rate, the exchange rate,' says Mr
Jonathan Heath, who heads Macroeconomia Asesoria, one of Mexico City's
largest private economic consulting firms.
The reason is an expanding current account deficit, widely forecast to rise
to Dollars 27bn (Pounds 19bn) this year (about 8 per cent of gross domestic
product) from an estimated Dollars 21.5bn in 1992. Imports have been growing
at 24 per cent a year since 1989; the figure for exports is 7 per cent.
Unlike in the early 1980s the problem is not the government running a budget
deficit, but the private sector.
It is, nonetheless, a potential government problem. The current account
deficit is expanding even as economic growth is slowing, from 3.6 per cent
in 1991 to an estimated 2.7 per cent last year. The government has to keep
interest rates high and the budget in surplus to ensure that capital
continues to flow into the country to finance the deficit, a policy that is
further slowing growth and partly explains recent declines in the
stockmarket.
For now the flows are continuing. However, a significant proportion - an
estimated third to a half - is unstable capital. Mexican and foreign
investors are switching funds out of dollars to invest in Mexican Treasury
bills, local currency deposits and other short-term funding to take
advantage of interest differentials between the US and Mexico. 'The cost of
current policy is that Mexico is very vulnerable to capital flows. The
picture can change in less than 30 days,' says Mr Heath.
Some economists think the government would be well advised to devalue the
currency sooner rather than later - the usual suggested figure is by 10 to
20 per cent - in an atmosphere of calm, rather than risk a crisis next year
when Mr Salinas steps down.
Mr Rogelio Ramirez de la O, a private consultant based in Mexico City,
thinks that if the currency is devalued early, accompanied by further
structural reforms, then Mexico could again enter a virtuous cycle and the
government would no longer be so vulnerable to capital flows. It would also
allow interest rates to fall and government spending to increase, giving
growth a push.
The government made an unexpected change in exchange rate policy last
October. It switched from a pre-set daily devaluation against the dollar
equivalent to 2.4 per cent a year, to an exchange rate target range which
widens daily. If the peso falls to its lowest permitted point, the new
policy would permit a 9 per cent depreciation of the peso this year.
Government officials say that under pressure they would widen the target
band to allow for a faster depreciation.
But Mr Ramirez reckons this could be the worst of all worlds: higher
interest rates would be needed to compensate investors for increasing
exchange rate uncertainty, without removing the threat of a devaluation.
However, the idea of a steep devaluation faces strong opposition, led by Mr
Pedro Aspe, finance minister, in the Mexican cabinet. 'It would be like
committing suicide because you're afraid of death,' said one senior official
last week.
He said a devaluation would probably be reflected in higher inflation rather
than increased competitiveness, and rejected claims that the size of the
current account deficit suggested a weakness in the economy. On the
contrary, he argued, the government's economic reforms had resulted in a
faster and deeper structural adjustment in manufacturing industry than
expected. But this had meant that more old factories were being closed -
indicating a swifter depreciation of existing capital stock - and had raised
demand for new investment (and imports).
The structural adjustment, by increasing productivity, should be worth a 10
per cent devaluation in terms of competitiveness and, once completed, should
allow the economy to grow at an annual 5 per cent rather than 3 per cent,
the official said.
However, some observers think the government's resistance to devaluation has
much more to do with politics than with economics. 'Politics aside, a
devaluation would be a good thing economically,' says Mr Heath.
'Politically, it would be a disaster: nearly every Mexican devaluation has
been accompanied by the resignation of the finance minister and central bank
governor.'
Mexican public opinion, moreover, is not sensitive directly to increased
interest rates because people have little access to credit or mortgages. On
the other hand, opinion is more sensitive to inflation, since only a
minority has access to interest-bearing bank accounts to cushion its
effects.
Furthermore, a devaluation would damage the annual pact between government,
labour and business which had trade unions agreeing to keep wage rises below
10 per cent this year. Devaluation to make Mexican goods more competitive
might also harm efforts to get the North American Free Trade Agreement
ratified by the US Congress this year.
Indeed, Nafta is the key from the government's point of view. With the
uncertainty about its ratification removed, more direct investment would be
expected to flow into Mexico, bolstering confidence and providing an anchor
for more short-term capital. If Nafta were called off, the shock would make
a devaluation all but inevitable.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Oil companies prepare for battle over energy levy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US OIL companies have begun to challenge President Bill Clinton's proposal
for a new tax levied on the energy content of fuels, but the administration
is hitting back by dubbing its critics lobbyists for special interests.
The American Petroleum Institute has questioned the administration's figures
for the tax, claiming that it will cost the average family Dollars 475 a
year - four times the Treasury's estimate of its impact - and claims it will
cost 700,000 jobs.
But Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, yesterday said the API's
figures were 'just wrong', and other members of the administration weighed
in against the oil industry assault.
'A plan that is bold like this is going to have a lot of special interest
opposition across the board, and so you are seeing the beginnings of it,' Mr
Leon Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said
yesterday.
However, some oil industry executives have backed the tax. Mr Lodwrick Cook,
chairman of Arco, said that by spreading the cost throughout the economy,
the proposed tax would not unfairly burden any single sector of the economy
or region of the country.
The new tax will be imposed at a rate of 25.7 cents per million British
thermal units on coal, nuclear energy and gas, and at a much steeper rate of
59.9 cents per million BTUs on oil. Mr Clinton said yesterday he would soon
propose easing bank regulations to try to alleviate the 'credit crunch' that
many businesses feel has stopped them from getting loans. Meanwhile, Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a congressional committee
there was no question the credit crunch still existed, and said the Fed
believed some banks had become too cautious about lending.

THE Argentine government will conclude an accord with international bank
creditors on April 7, said Mr Domingo Cavallo, the Argentine economy
minister, and Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank, in New York
yesterday. Citibank heads Argentina's bank advisory committee.
Argentina will conclude the deal by exchanging two types of new concessional
bonds for the Dollars 20bn (Pounds 14bn) in bank loans held by more than 750
creditors.
Creditors holding 99 per cent of the debt have already signed the debt
accord, which was agreed in principle last April 7.
Argentina will also issue Dollars 8bn of new bonds covering interest
arrears, but they will be placed in an escrow account until the claims from
creditors for past due interest are fully reconciled.

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commission plans to press for minimum prices on east European steel
exports go against the spirit of free trade agreements with emerging
democracies to the east, according to Britain, Andrew Hill writes from
Brussels.
Brussels has said the EC should persuade east European governments to impose
minimum prices over three years, or face stiff anti-dumping duties.
Community industry ministers will discuss the plan tomorrow, when they are
expected to give initial political backing to an overall programme of
support for the ailing EC steel industry, in exchange for deep cuts in
capacity.
Britain made the development of partnerships with eastern Europe a priority
of its EC presidency, which ended in December, and believes the Commission
proposals run counter to the conclusions of the Edinburgh summit.
EC leaders at Edinburgh called for implementation of last year's commercial
and political agreements with the Czech and Slovak republics, Poland and
Hungary 'speedily and in full'.
However, it is already clear that the British position is unlikely to win
much support in tomorrow's council. Germany, Italy and Spain are said to be
particularly eager for more protection against cheap imports.

<TEXT>
THE US administration will stick by last July's agreement with the EC
limiting government financial support to their respective civil aviation
industries, despite President Bill Clinton's recent attacks on Airbus
subsidies.
A spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, said a senior
US official yesterday responded to the European Commission's request for
clarification of the president's remarks by saying 'we won't be opening (the
subsidies agreement) up; we intend to stick to it.'
Earlier yesterday the Commission had again challenged the US to live up to
its undertaking with the EC.
Officials pointed out that the terms of the agreement precluded either a
review or any party's withdrawal before July 1994.
Last July's deal settled a potentially explosive five-year dispute over
Airbus subsidies, provoked by the European consortium's increasing success
against Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in world markets. The agreement outlaws
future production and marketing subsidies, and caps development subventions
at 33 per cent.
The EC claims that US manufacturers get big indirect subsidies through the
American defence and space budgets. Under the pact indirect subsidies will
be capped at 3 per cent of industry turn-over, or 4 per cent of company
sales.
In London, Downing Street indicated that Mr John Major would take a firm
line in defending the financial support given to the Airbus project when he
meets Mr Clinton in Washington today.
Downing Street pointed out that the US government supported its domestic
aircraft industry via Nasa. The UK provided Pounds 700m of launch aid to
Airbus and had already recouped Pounds 140m from levies on the sale of the
A320 aeroplane, it added.
Britain expects all the launch aid to be repaid over the life of the Airbus
project.
Mr Clinton told cheering Boeing workers on Monday that he would seek 'tough
new discipline' on subsidies granted to Airbus while 'closely monitoring'
the pact. Any new measures tightening the rules on subsidies are likely to
be brought up in the multilateral negotiations under the Gatt aircraft code,
according to sources close to the administration.
When the bilateral deal was concluded last July it contained an agreement to
'multilateralise' the limits on support.
Failure to do so after a year could clear the way for either party to
withdraw from the agreement. However, even if the subsidies limits are
agreed multilaterally, both the US and Airbus country governments still have
the option of walking away from the pact.
The administration is by no means set on a course of action. The US industry
has been reluctant to act against a rival which is also a customer. But one
option under consideration is the filing of a countervailing duty case under
US trade law. This would at least counter Airbus subsidies in the US market.

A PRIVATELY-OWNED Turkish construction company is to build a Dollars 115m
(Pounds 81m) petrochemical plant in Russia, financing the scheme by selling
the product on interna tional markets.
Tekfen Holding, one of Turkey's largest companies, initialled an agreement
in Moscow with Zangas, the state agency which runs the gas complex at
Stavropol.
Construction will take two years. The proceeds from sale of the output will
be paid into an escrow account to repay the banks. The company hopes to win
financial support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
as well as Turkey's own Eximbank.
Tekfen, the first Turkish group to build a petrochemical plant, will install
equipment delivered to the site more than three years ago by the British
company John Brown Engineering, but never erected.
The plant will have annual capacity of 100,000 tonnes of polypropylene, a
raw material for the plastics industry.
Tekfen has already secured a government licence to export the product.
However, agreement has still to be negotiated with Gasprom, the Russian gas
utility, to supply the plant's raw material. Tekfen also has to agree
financing guarantees with the banks.

FT  24 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Time for stocktaking in steel talks - US
and EC negotiators meet today in a sombre mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE mood at today's Geneva negotiations aimed at formulating a multilateral
steel agreement is likely to be tense. World steel exporters continue to
fume at US dumping and countervailing duties that have virtually closed the
US market to their products, while the EC is mulling steel production quotas
and considering Ecu900m (Pounds 743.4m) in aid for steel plant closures.
'It should be apparent within five minutes whether headway is likely to be
made,' said one senior US official. Three days have been set aside for the
talks, which broke down in Geneva in March last year. Officials say it will
be an encouraging sign if talks continue into the third day.
Negotiators are not expecting any breakthrough. US negotiators may not quite
be working in a policy void, but will need more time to receive clear trade
guidelines from the new Clinton administration.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, former US ambassador to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, has yet to be confirmed formally as deputy to Mr Mickey Kantor, the
US trade representative, and until that time negotiators have no one to take
instructions from.
Similarly, EC officials seeking a solution to the problems of chronic steel
overcapacity among member states may not appreciate their hands being tied
at this stage by a multilateral agreement. A meeting in Brussels tomorrow on
reorganisation of Europe's steel industry is probably a more pressing
priority.
The meeting will thus focus on 'stocktaking', taking the draft agreement
abandoned in March last year and ensuring there is agreement on what the
package aims to achieve.
For many the meeting will be a first opportunity to vent spleen against a
blizzard of dumping actions taken over the past three months.
Most sweeping have been US actions, announced late in January, which
targeted carbon steel products from 19 countries, levying duties of up to
110 per cent. Significant also have been EC duties imposed on exporters from
eastern Europe.
The firm message from US steel producers is that there must be no dilution
of US national trade laws - in particular the countervailing duty laws that
target foreign subsidies. These and dumping actions have been used to great
effect since November to shore up the domestic industry.
As imports have been priced out of the market by high dumping duties, local
steel prices have risen by at least 5 per cent, giving much-needed relief to
less-efficient local producers.
A year ago, the EC and other steel exporters were demanding that the US
agree to a period for consultation before unleashing dumping or
countervailing duty actions. They will be keen to know whether the US
remains as fiercely opposed to this today as it was last March.
The issue of subsidies will be high on the agenda. The last draft
multilateral steel agreement bans subsidies for steel industries except
where specific waivers are agreed. These would be confined to environmental
needs, research, aid for laid-off workers, and for company closures. The US
is likely to see the latest EC proposal to provide Ecu900m in aid for
steel-workers laid off by plant closures as a litmus test: US steel
companies have had no such help in coping with closures.
An issue that is not likely to be pressed by US negotiators will be the call
for renewal of any 'voluntary restraint agreements' - the expiry of which in
March last year triggered the US dumping and countervailing duty actions.
The VRAs were in force for 10 years, but by 1991 exporting countries were
taking up no more than 60-70 per cent of the quotas allowed them under the
restraint agreements. 'The problem was not the volume of imports, but the
price,' commented one US trade lawyer.
A lonely US lobbying voice is likely to be the steel users, who insist that
the recently imposed dumping duties 'are already generating shortages, price
increases, inflation, and increased retaliation' by trade partners such as
Mexico and Canada.
The American Institute for International Steel, which represents these
importer interests, says dumping margins were overstated by at least 12 per
cent because of currency fluctuations.
US trade experts said these contrary US voices were unlikely to receive much
attention in the US until shortages of certain steel products became acute,
perhaps by May. By then, President Bill Clinton's trade policies are likely
to be more clearly formulated, and substantive negotiations towards an MSA
may be renewed.
Meanwhile, it will not be overlooked by US negotiators that the EC
delegation is taking the opportunity of its visit to Geneva to present to
the Gatt its case for contesting the US dumping and countervailing duties as
illegal under international trade law. This is the first step towards a
formal Gatt panel investigating the US actions.
Both sides will be hoping that a multilateral steel agreement can be in
place soon enough to avert a full Gatt challenge.

</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA is taking steps to ensure that the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) is on the statute book before the general election later
this year.
Mr Michael Wilson, trade minister, may introduce in parliament as early as
today legislation implementing the Nafta provisions. The accord, signed by
the US, Mexico and Canada last year, is due to take effect next January 1.
Passage of the bill through parliament is likely to take several months and
to be fought at every stage by both main opposition parties, the Liberals
and New Democrats. However, Mr Wilson and his Conservative colleagues appear
eager to present Nafta as a fait accompli during the election campaign which
is expected to start in late summer or early autumn. The Liberals, who are
far ahead in public opinion polls, have yet to spell out a clear policy on
the agreement.
Opposition to North American free trade is far more widespread in Canada
than in either the US or Mexico. A Gallup poll last autumn revealed that 60
per cent of Canadians believe Nafta will on balance be bad for the country,
against 27 per cent who think it will do more good than harm. Only 24 per
cent of Americans and 17 per cent of Mexicans were against free trade.
A trade official said Ottawa expected the Clinton administration to submit
Nafta legislation to Congress in late spring or early summer, pending
negotiations with Congress. After that, it thought passage of the bill would
be relatively quick.
In Mexico, most of the Nafta provisions are self-implementing or can be put
into force through executive regulations.
US, Canadian and Mexican officials are due to start talks next month on
parallel agreements covering environmental and labour issues.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday told Israeli leaders
that Arab countries were willing to resume peace talks which have been
stalled since December when 415 Palestinians were expelled from the country.
On the last and toughest leg of his tour of the Middle East, Mr Christopher
met Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister; Mr Shimon Peres, foreign
minister; Mr Ehud Barak, army chief-of-staff; and the heads of the Israeli
delegations to the peace talks, who expressed their similar desire for the
peace negotiations to be revived.
However, Palestinians insist that all the deportees should be repatriated
before the talks resume. Mr Christopher last night met Palestinian leaders.
Their spokeswoman, Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, told him she thought it unlikely peace
talks would resume under present conditions, despite indications that Israel
might be ready to make further concessions on the deportees.
Israeli officials said the message they had received from the US secretary
of state was that the Arab countries had softened their stance and were
willing to return to the negotiating table. This the Arabs would be prepared
to do even without the immediate return of all the deportees, although
further concessions on Jerusalem's part were expected.
Under international pressure, Israel agreed three weeks ago to allow 101
deportees to return and to halve the expulsion terms of the rest to one
year.
'Our impression from the meeting is that at least, insofar as the Arab
countries are concerned, the deportee issue has not been presented as a
condition for resuming the peace process,' said Mr Gad Ben-Ari, the prime
minister's spokesman.
'It's an issue for which we will have to find a solution, but it is
certainly not a condition for reviving the talks.'
During his meeting with Mr Rabin, the US secretary of state was reported to
have raised the issue of human rights violations in the occupied
territories.
He was told by the prime minister that Israel would like to delegate more
power to the Palestinians, although not at the expense of its own security.
Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said he understood from Mr
Christopher that the US intended to increase its involvement in the Middle
East peace talks.
However, 'I think the most important message given by the secretary of state
is that after his recent tour he sees there is a chance to advance the peace
process. As far as we are concerned, this is the best news,' he added.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Delhi fails to ring telecom changes: India is finding the
practice of deregulation harder than the theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN India announced in 1991 that private companies would be permitted to
enter its tightly-controlled state-owned telecommunications industry,
executives from the biggest names in the business hurried to New Delhi to
examine the opportunities in what promised to be a multi-billion dollar
market.
They need not have rushed. Eighteen months later, the government has come to
a grinding halt in its efforts to attract domestic and foreign groups into
two key areas - the supply of telephone switching equipment and the
establishment of cellular telephone networks in the four big cities of
Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. Companies seeking the switching gear
contract have run into a complex dispute over technical standards.
Bidders for the cellular phone licences have fared even worse - the tenders
have been referred to the Delhi High Court amid allegations of corruption,
mismanagement and nepotism.
The telecom disputes highlight an important failing of India's much-vaunted
economic reforms - the inability to implement policy decisions. As a
telecommunications ministry official admits: 'Having opened up the market to
international investors, the government has failed to devise a system for
the award of the contracts which is not only fair but which also appears to
be fair.'
The contracts for cellular telephones were awarded amid tough competition,
controversy, and protests in parliament about the need for a sophisticated
mobile network. Many MPs felt the money would have been better spent on more
ordinary telephone lines which number just 0.52 per hundred Indians.
Eight companies, two for each city, were shortlisted from 30 original bids.
The successful foreign groups, all teamed with Indian partners included
General Mobile and Vodafone of the UK, Societe Francaise du Radiotelephone
and France Telecom from France, the Australian and Overseas Telecom
Corporation (AOTC), and three Bell companies from North America.
Two unsuccessful bidders decided to sue, accusing the government of
corruption and arbitrariness. IXL, a telecom company belonging to the
Delhi-based Dalmia group, and Anido, a member of Bombay's Onida electronics
group, filed a joint petition in the Delhi High Court in November,
maintaining that 'the selection criteria were neither properly evolved or
applied'.
A month later, Hutchison Max, a joint venture between the Hong Kong-based
Hutchison Whampoa and the Delhi-based Bhai Mohan Singh group, filed another
petition, claiming that though its tenders for Bombay and Delhi ranked
highest in the selection process, they were disqualified because of a
typographical error in their compliance statement. Both petitions allege
that BPL Systems and Projects which has tied up with France Telecom and been
awarded the Bombay contract, has 'grossly violated tender conditions'.
Hutchison Max's petition has been supported by a winning bidder - Tata
Cellular, which together with Bell Canada, has been awarded part of the New
Delhi network. Tata Cellular contends that the selection process 'is
subjective and based on erroneous assumptions'.
The Hutchison Max petition complained of 'hidden evaluation criteria'. It
alleged that Mr B R Nair, a member of the government's Telecom Commission,
who as 'chiefly responsible for recommending the rejection of the Hutchison
Max bid was well aware of the fact that the key beneficiary of this decision
would be BPL. Knowing that his son was working with BPL, such a decision
smacks of nepotism/favouritism and an arbitrary exercise of power.' Mr Nair
denies the allegation.
A judgment from the Delhi High Court is still awaited, over two months after
the hearings ended, and India's cellular mobile plan will have to wait.
The government's plan to purchase switching equipment worth Rs1.5bn (Pounds
35m), to meet its ambitious target of providing 1.1m new telephone lines in
1993-94, also ran into trouble, with almost all the major bidders, including
Siemens and Ericsson, failing to pass the stringent technical validation
tests stipulated by the telecommunications ministry. Fujitsu of Japan passed
the validation test and is awaiting a firm contract from the government. No
one is openly questioning the ministry's technical expertise to evaluate the
tenders but the foreign bidders are unhappy with the selection procedure.
'What was most frustrating was that at no point did the government specify
which of the 40-odd tests each company had failed to clear,' says a senior
manager of one of the unsuccessful companies.
The disputes and delays have brought sharply into focus the need for reform
of the public sector tendering system and for a less arbitrary and
bureaucratic method of selection.
The snags in India's telecom privatisation programme could adversely affect
the country's entire economic reforms effort, admit government officials.
'Though the importance of telecoms is slowly dawning on the government,
there seems a bureaucratic reluctance to get projects off the ground, and
give foreign investors the impression that things are moving,' says a top
official of a telecom company.
The World Bank, in a report on Indian telecommunications, suggested radical
management and infrastructural reform. The telecom services in India, notes
the report, are pitifully thin compared with other developing countries.
Subscribers sometimes wait ten years for a telephone connection. The bank
felt that even eight times the existing 5.8m lines could be effectively put
to use by a population exceeding 850m.
The government's expansion plan envisages only 20m lines by the year 2000.
Businessmen and others can pay stiff fees to secure lines on a priority
basis. But they are still hampered by the poor quality of much of the
network. Thus, cellular phones are expected to be very popular - if and when
the government allows companies to provide them.

YEMEN'S parliamentary elections on April 27 are viewed by some as a test
case for democratic reform in the Arab world.
But a weak economy, social unrest and political squabbling have clouded the
electoral process and there are no guarantees of a smooth transition to the
hoped-for democracy.
At issue are the 301 seats in the Yemeni parliament. But the future of the
present government is in doubt since the parliament must choose a new
president. 'And that' said a Yemeni academic, 'is what the whole contest is
all about.'
The government was formed on May 22 1990 when the former North and South
Yemens united. Essentially a coalition between the south's Yemen Socialist
party and the north's General Peoples' Congress, the government was charged
with effecting democratic elections by the end of November 1992.
Elections were delayed because disagreements between the coalition partners
held up the selection of a committee on electoral procedures.
Since then, the country has witnessed continued wrangling between the ruling
parties, riots which left some 15 dead and 100 injured, and a spate of bomb
attacks which killed two people and narrowly missed 100 US soldiers
quartered in Aden as part of Operation Restore Hope.
Though partners in the transition government, the GPC and YSP are also
contenders in the election. This has created tension and, according to
Yemen's prime minister, Mr Haydar Abu Bakr Al-Attas, it is the lack of
accord between the two ruling parties which has caused the recent troubles.
Referring to 'differences' between the YSP and the GPC, the prime minister
said in December that they 'had paved the way for erroneous action and
behaviour and for all the damage these could cause to the economic, social
and political situation'.
Led by the President, General Ali Abdullah Saleh, the GPC was once
considered the favourite to win any election. Seen as the architect of
unification, a highly emotive issue in Yemen, Gen Saleh was at the peak of
his popularity in the early days of the new state.
But 36 per cent unemployment, 100 per cent inflation for the second year
running, and widespread suspicion of corruption in his government, now mean
Gen Saleh can not count on a majority in the election. The GPC has lost
ground and is campaigning to regain voter confidence.
The YSP has gained considerable ground in the past nine months. Headed by
the vice-president, Mr Ali Salem Al-Beidh, the YSP was highly unpopular at
the time of unification and generally considered a spent political force.
Since then the YSP has used key positions in the government, civil service,
the military and the labour unions to extract concessions from the president
and to drum up popular support. And, in contrast to the GPC, the YSP is not
under suspicion of corruption. Still, the more populous northerners harbour
doubts about the Socialists and are unlikely to grant them a clear majority
in parliament either.
The other main contender for power is the Islah party, an uneasy union of
tribal and Islamic elements, headed by the tribal leader Sheikh Abdullah bin
Hussain Al-Ahmar and the fundamentalist preacher Abdul Mujeed Az-Zindani.
Islah represents some of the most conservative elements in Yemeni society
and has appeal in a country where nearly half the population of 14m live in
villages of fewer than 250 inhabitants. However, Islah it is perceived as a
party rooted in the past and although it will be a force in the elections,
it is unlikely to carry a majority.
Apart from the GPC, the YSP, and Islah the remainder of Yemen's 40 or so
political parties are loosely grouped together in a rainbow coalition called
the National Conference. Although it has become a political conscience,
condemning the transition government at every opportunity, it lacks popular
appeal and is unlikely to command much electoral support. But through its
criticism, the National Conference will be a focus for public scrutiny of
the major parties.
So far there appears to be no clear victor in sight, but if the squabbles
continue, democracy could be the loser. The recent troubles have at least
brought recognition of the potential crisis facing the country and of the
pressing need to do something about it.

<TEXT>
THE success of the transfer to New Zealand's central bank of control over
monetary policy will be fully tested in the next few years by more rapid
economic growth, the OECD says in a review of the country's Reserve Bank
Act, writes Terry Hall.
In its latest survey of New Zealand, the OECD says the act, which makes
price stability the sole objective of monetary policy, has 'significantly
enhanced' policy credibility over the past two years in securing low
inflation targets.
'Despite the exchange rate depreciation of 1991, the adjusted CPI increase,
used as a measure of underlying inflation, is still running at the bottom of
the Reserve Bank interim target band for 1992 of 1.5 to 3.5 per cent, and is
expected to remain within the target range of nil to 2 per cent to the end
of this year.'
The OECD said the recession had contributed to the achievement, but the
existence of the target had seemingly strengthened the resolve of the
authorities to take necessary (monetary policy) measures.
'The importance of the act lies in its future contribution to sustained
price stability.' It said this will be tested in the coming years.

FT  24 FEB 93 / India plans new reforms for economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian government yesterday committed itself to further economic reform,
including cuts in the government deficit and subsidies, closure of unviable
state-owned enterprises and further exchange-rate liberalisation.
Tax and customs duty rationalisation and overhaul of the financial system
are also on the agenda, under the annual economic survey presented to
parliament yesterday, in advance of Saturday's annual budget, when specific
measures will be announced. The report spells out problems the government
faces, such as the cost of social security for workers dismissed from
loss-making enterprises, and the need to invest in education and
infrastructure.
Wide-ranging reforms Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, launched in
mid-1991 were beginning to yield results, the report says. It forecasts 4
per cent economic growth for the year to March 1993, up from a revised 1.2
per cent for the previous year. Wholesale price inflation is seen at under
10 per cent, down from 13.6 per cent.
Agricultural output is expected to rise 5 per cent, because of good rains
last summer. But industrial output is growing by less than previously
expected, at a likely 4-4.5 per cent. The report says India still has
difficulties with its balance of payments, with exports growing slower than
expected due to declining trade with former Soviet bloc countries.
In dollar terms, exports have risen 3.4 per cent in the eight months to
December 1992, though exports to countries outside the former Soviet bloc
climbed 11.4 per cent. Even this is short of the government's 15-20 per cent
export growth target. Current-account deficit should be cut from a likely
2.8 per cent of GDP in 1992-1993 to under 1 per cent in 1995-1996.
The report acknowledges the inter-religious violence after destruction of
the Ayodhya mosque on December 6 hit output, exports and tourism, but does
not estimate the losses. Last year's Bombay securities market scandal also
hit confidence. The scandal highlighted the need for comprehensive financial
reform, including banking reform. A key proposal is for cutting the
proportion of cheap bank loans to the government, a rule which cramps
commercial banking.
'The policy initiatives introduced after June 1991 have been seen to work.
This gives us confidence we can overcome the constraints on our economy,
assuring a more prosperous future.'
Mr Sudhakarrao Naik, chief minister of Maharashtra State which includes
Bombay, the city which bore the brunt of the recent inter-religious unrest,
has resigned. Mr Naik, a leading member of the ruling Congress (I) party,
was ordered to go by Mr Rao after being heavily criticised for his handling
of the riots which left more than 600 dead in Bombay.
The atmosphere in Delhi remains tense, due to a clash between the government
and the Bharatiya Janata party, the right-wing Hindu party whose supporters
sacked the Ayodhya mosque. The clash came over the BJP's plans for a rally
in the capital tomorrow. The BJP intends to defy a government ban on the
event.

THE Kenyan government yesterday pressed the International Monetary Fund to
resume aid, after effectively floating its currency, the shilling, last
week, Reuter reports from Nairobi.
Government officials said Mr Musalia Mudavadi, finance minister, and Mr
George Saitoti, economic planning minister, discussed Kenya's faltering
economic performance with a visiting IMF team, but declined to divulge any
details.
State radio said the government had taken 'far-reaching financial reforms'
and that aid should not be withheld because it 'weakened the economy and
caused misery to millions'.
The IMF delegation is in Nairobi for two weeks to examine government books
to see if Kenya can qualify for aid worth about Dollars 350m (Pounds 246m) a
year, frozen in November 1991 to force the government into economic and
political reforms.
Western donors said they could not prejudge the outcome of the talks but
thought it unlikely aid would be resumed soon, despite measures over the
past two weeks which should impress the IMF.
They said recent action to liberalise the foreign exchange market and grain
trade had gone far to meet demands sought by bilateral and multilateral
donors, but that the government still had a lot to do.
Last Friday, on the eve of the IMF team's arrival, Mr Mudavadi announced the
effective flotation of the Kenyan shilling. He said only government debt
servicing and imports would use the official central bank exchange rate of
around 36 shillings to the dollar, and importers could henceforth freely buy
foreign exchange from commercial banks.

AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications group, moved
yesterday to establish a much stronger presence in the potentially huge
Chinese market by signing a memorandum of understanding with the Beijing
government's state planning agency for joint development of the country's
communications infrastructure.
Mr Randall Tobias, vice-chairman of AT&amp;T, said that projects contemplated in
the partnership were 'potentially among the most extensive in our company's
history'.
The putative projects include local manufacturing and research and
development in at least 10 areas, ranging from network management to
customer premises equipment and cellular communications systems.
The first stage of the partnership would be the establishment of a joint
venture to make AT&amp;T's advanced 5ESS switch in China.
This would require US government approval.
However, no difficulties are expected as AT&amp;T already sells switching and
transmission systems to China.
AT&amp;T said the agreement could lead to billions of dollars in revenues. But
it will face fierce competition for contracts from European and Japanese
equipment manufacturing rivals, notably Alcatel of France, which is believed
to be the largest supplier of switching equipment to the Chinese market.

NORWAY yesterday announced plans partially to lift economic and trade
sanctions against South Africa, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
A ban on trade, services and investments, implemented in 1986 and 1987,
would be lifted from March 15 but an embargo on sales of oil and weapons
would be upheld.
Norway's exports to South Africa, comprising mainly iron ore, fish, fish
products and mechanical equipment, fell to NKr56.2m (Pounds 5.6m) in 1987,
after sanctions were implemented, from NKr348.3m in 1986.
Norway said the time had come to introduce new political instruments to
promote democracy in South Africa; it had formulated a five-point programme
to provide assistance during the transition. Meanwhile the Swedish
government said yesterday it hoped to lift sanctions against South Africa
within a few weeks, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
Mr Carl Bildt, Swedish prime minister, said: 'It is a matter of weeks', but
he stressed removal of sanctions would be conditional on continuing
democratic reforms in South Africa.
Sweden banned investments in South Africa in 1979 and imposed a ban on trade
in 1987.

</HEADLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND'S economy should continue to grow by 2.5-3 per cent a year until
1994, with growth led by exports and increasingly supported by domestic
demand, the OECD says in its latest survey.
Low inflation and more efficient use of labour should lead to increasing
international gains in competitiveness. But import demand is also likely to
pick up, making further improvements in the current account difficult.
The competitiveness gains follow a long and painful period of adjustment
since 1984, and 'may provide a harbinger of stronger growth based on
expanding the range and market share of New Zealand exports'.
But there are risks which 'could deny this outcome', the greatest of which
would be a deteriorating external environment. A slowdown in world economic
activity or increasing trade protection abroad could adversely affect export
revenues, either by depressing prices of traditional commodities exports or
by limiting opportunities for other products.
With high levels of public debt and sizeable projected budget deficits, the
economy also remained exposed to adverse interest rate movements and other
external shocks.
The OECD noted the budget deficit in the year to June 1992 was 1 percentage
point higher than projected, at 3.4 per cent of GDP. The government's
finances were an area of concern, and continued spending restraint was
essential.
'Given the high level of external debt, it is vital that the confidence of
foreign investors in fiscal policy is maintained and any risk to long-term
interest rates minimised.' The deficit was projected to rise in the current
year, before falling to 2.7 per cent of GDP by 1994-1995. But this depended
on a sustained recovery with inflation of 0-2 per cent.
In a generally optimistic report, the OECD said the present policy
environment in New Zealand would support a transition to faster growth,
lower inflation, greater labour flexibility, stronger export performance and
the growing international orientation of the business community. But greater
attention should be paid to training, education and skills shortages.

economy sinks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN IS facing one of the most comprehensive, complex and severe economic
crises since the end of the second world war.
The sharp fall in land, property and share prices from the heyday of the
speculative bubble economy between 1987 and 1989, has led to a steep fall in
private demand.
Manufacturers overinvested and overproduced in the late 1980s. In cars and
electronics especially, they have been carrying huge stocks of idle machines
and unsold products. Consumer demand for them appears to be saturated.
The population's propensity to consume is falling as people's anxiety about
the outlook leads them to build up precautionary savings.
The financial sector is hobbled by mounting bad debts at the banks, a
prolonged slump in share prices and very low trading volumes on the stock
market, which is punishing the profits of securities houses.
Without a healthy financial sector, the economy will find it difficult to
generate the credit needed to finance recovery.
Japan's much vaunted industrial companies let their personnel and investment
costs grow rapidly in the 1980s, an increase disguised at the time by the
very low cost of raising capital.
As Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, put it yesterday,
the rapid economic expansion at the end of the decade merely delayed the
need for Japanese companies to cut costs in line with slower growth.
This combination of pressures has left the economy in a vulnerable and
volatile state. The stock market is drifting listlessly around the 16,800
level, open to a further sharp fall as companies revise profits down before
the end of the financial year at the end of next month.
The sudden appreciation of the yen against the dollar in the past two weeks
has hit exporters. The growth in the trade surplus fuels worries about a
resurgence of trade friction with the US.
Many companies are waiting to see whether the economy can recover. They are
holding fire on plans to cut their payrolls and restructure some of the
international operations they acquired at great cost in the 1980s. The
electronics company JVC signalled at the weekend what might be in store by
announcing plans to close subsidiaries in the Netherlands and Germany.
Companies may not have to wait for long. The forces behind the downturn will
come to a head in the next few months. Things may well get worse before they
get better.
The response of Japan's politicians, bureaucrats and executives will
determine whether the economy slumps into a prolonged period of very slow
growth or whether it can stage a modest recovery from the end of the year.
They will have to confront some of the most powerful taboos of Japanese
economic and corporate life to rescue the economy.
Fiscal policy - public spending and tax cuts - will be vital to compensate
for the fall in consumer spending. But income tax cuts will require higher
government borrowing, turning back the hard won consolidation of public
finances during the 1980s. The Liberal Democratic party will have to assert
itself over the Finance Ministry which rules budgetary policy. The party's
leaders will have to face up to their seniors, still influential older
leaders such as former prime ministers Nakasone and Fukuda who oppose higher
borrowing.
The hard-pressed banks will come under increasing pressure from the Bank of
Japan to deal with their bad debts. Many would make sharply lower profits if
they had to write off non-performing assets. Some would be forced into
losses. No Japanese bank has made a loss since the end of the last war.
Industrial companies are just embarking on a long retrenchment, which will
force them to amend some of their traditional values and practices.
At companies such as Matsushita in electronics and Bridgestone, the tyre
maker, this has already involved dramatic changes in senior management. More
companies in cars, steel and electronics are likely to follow Nissan's plan
to reduce its workforce by almost 10 per cent in the next few years. Sanyo,
the electronics group, is not alone in decentralising to give its divisions
more autonomy.
Everywhere, Japanese companies say that after three years of declining
profits, the imperative is to improve profitability rather than the
traditional goal of expanding market share.
Japanese policymakers and companies are well known for their long-termism,
their strategic approach to investment and their patience over earning
returns upon it.
The reality is that the creativity of the Japanese economy has been largely
the product of crisis - from the occupation after the second world war to
the oil shocks of the 1970s and the high yen recession of the mid-1980s.
With the economy close to the core of another such crisis, everything will
turn on whether the response is another bout of feverish creativity or a
lapse into complacency.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Japan Responds to Downturn: Nissan takes a sharp turn to
stay on the road - Emergency directors' meeting orders radical restructuring
of the company in the face of losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN HAS been shifting the bullet around its mouth since last summer.
Yesterday it finally bit it.
Early in the morning an emergency meeting of its directors agreed a radical
restructuring plan to stem the car manufacturer's mounting losses. By the
afternoon the details were echoing from factory public address systems as
managers outlined the plan to the company's 53,000-strong workforce.
As one executive put it: 'This re-structuring is deeper and more
comprehensive than any previous measures we have taken. We have cut costs
before; this time we are trying to change the company's structure.'
The plan involves the closure in 1995 of the 29-year-old Zama vehicle
assembly plant near Tokyo, a 9.4 per cent reduction in the workforce by
March 1996, and a sharp cut in the variety of models Nissan will make and
the components it uses.
The financial imperatives have become inescapable. Nissan said it expected
to make a pre-tax loss of Y29bn (Pounds 170m) in the year to the end of
March, almost double its November estimate of Y15bn. The previous year it
made a Y87bn pre-tax profit.
The reasons for an operating loss which is expected to reach Y39bn are not
hard to find. Sales will fall from 1,318,000 units last year to 1,180,000.
At the same time Nissan's costs are rising, largely to pay for its heavy
investment in the late 1980s.  Depreciation will rise from Y96.9bn in the
1990 financial year to Y160bn in 1994.
Nissan hopes the restructuring plan will return it to profit next year,
allow it to resume cash dividends in the following one, and secure a
'reasonable level of profit' in 1996.
But the plan to save Y200bn a year by the spring of 1996 is not just a
response to the sharp fall in demand from the boom years of the late 1980s.
It is designed to cope with very slow growth in the 1990s. 'Nissan is
committed to slim down its operational structure so that it will be able to
secure a reasonable level of profits even under no growth in production
volumes,' the plan says.
The ageing Zama production plant, which is in an expensive area close to
Tokyo and employs about 4,000 workers, will be closed in the spring of 1995.
Production of the Sunny model will be shifted to Kyushu, where the world's
newest car plant opened last year at a cost of Y100bn.
The Kyushu plant has been producing at an annual rate of only 423,000 cars,
well below its 600,000 capacity. The transfer from Zama will take it to full
capacity.
The other car made at Zama, the low-volume Presea, will be transferred to
the Maruyama plant which is making about 325,000 cars a year compared with a
capacity of 480,000.
Zama's workers will be transferred to other jobs. But the Nissan workforce
will be reduced by 5,000 to 48,000 by March 1996 mainly through restricting
recruitment and natural wastage. More than 3,000 people leave Nissan's
employment each year.
Most significantly, 80 per cent of the reduction will be in white collar
jobs, the first time restructuring has touched the highly protected salaried
workers. About 32,000 of Nissan's workforce are office and administrative
staff.
During the recession of the mid-1980s Nissan reduced its workforce by 6,000,
but mainly by not renewing contracts for temporary workers. Now full-time
jobs will be cut.
The number of model variations which Nissan offers will be cut by 35 per
cent in 1996, compared with June 1992, while the variety of parts will be
reduced by 40 per cent. This should produce almost half the overall cost
savings.
A string of smaller changes, including giving manufacturing staff much more
influence over how cars are designed to make sure they can be made
efficiently, are the main ingredients of a plan to increase factory floor
productivity by 10 per cent a year.
Nissan said its international operations would be fully involved in the
cost-reduction programme, which would include moves fully to integrate
international research, development and design.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Japan Responds to Downturn: Matsushita chief quits in
mid-term - Scandal and poor results force Tanii to resign

THE surprise announcement by Matsushita Electric, the world's largest
consumer electronics group and owner of MCA, the US film studio, that its
president, Mr Akio Tanii, would quit immediately has sent shock waves
through the Japanese business community and increased concerns about the
state of the company.
Mr Tanii who leaves his post in mid-term, will be succeeded by Mr Yoichi
Morishita, the executive vice-president
As Japanese companies usually take their time in preparing for the
succession to the top post, the abruptness of Mr Tanii's departure has
fanned speculation he was forced out to take the blame for the company's
poor performance.
Mr Tanii said he was taking responsibility for the involvement of National
Lease, a subsidiary, in a financial scandal that rocked Japan in the summer
of 1991. 'I felt it was important to clarify responsibility for certain
unfortunate matters that occurred during my presidency,' Mr Tanii said.
National Lease had extended loans totalling Y50bn (Pounds 292.39m) to Toyo
Shinkin bank, a former branch head of which had made illegal loans to an
Osaka restaurateur. The involvement of National Lease in the Toyo Shinkin
scandal led the Matsushita subsidiary to post a Y20.9bn loan loss.
Mr Tanii was expected to take responsibility for the scandal and resign last
autumn, when the company's interim results were released.
He raised eyebrows in Japan when he failed to do so, and criticism of the
group has intensified as it has struggled to put behind the bad news and
direct its energies toward improving battered fortunes.
Yesterday's announcement failed to explain the timing of his resignation and
it
heightened concerns that unless the group takes drastic measures it could
find itself in serious trouble.
The group reported dismal third quarter results for the three months to
December 1992. Its consolidated third quarter results showed pre-tax profits
were down 60 per cent to Y50.2bn in the three months to December. Sales were
6 per cent down to Y1,882.8bn.
Net income fell by 76 per cent to Y12.6bn from a previous Y52.4bn. In the
nine months to December, the group saw pre-tax profits fall 63 per cent to
Y118.1bn (Y322.7bn).
While all consumer electronics companies have been hurt by the downturn in
consumer spending worldwide, Matsushita has also been rocked by the impact
of defects that were found in 700,000 of its refrigerators in addition to
the National Lease scandal.
The company has been restructuring its operations in an attempt to increase
profits while sales remain flat but this has added to grumblings from
disgruntled retailers unhappy about new tight-fisted measures by Matsushita.
The consensus however has been that more needs to be done.
'The organisation is bloated, there is a lack of vertical and horizontal
communication,' one industry analyst said. 'The question being asked is what
is the company going to do from now on?'
Hope was expressed yesterday that Mr Morishita would be able to breathe some
fresh air into the company. The new president, who is 57 this year, has
risen rapidly up the ranks, having just been promoted to executive
vice-president in December, and is known as a man who can get things done.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Japan Responds to Downturn: Mieno urges banks to write off
bad loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE banks should accelerate the disposal of non-performing assets and
write off their bad loans, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's governor
warned yesterday.
Mr Mieno said Japanese banks were slower than their US counterparts had been
to deal with their bad debts. He called on them to more actively strengthen
their battered balance sheets.
There could be no increase in the overall amount of credit without
additional equity, he said.
The Bank of Japan is concerned that the banks' strategy to gradually pay for
the losses over several years could be a long term constraint on both their
profitability and their ability to lend.
Speaking to a lunchtime meeting of businessmen in Tokyo, organised by the
Yomiuri newspaper group, he said the banking system's bad debts were still
manageable.
The non performing loans of the country's top banks were Y12.3bn (Pounds
71.92m) at the end of last September, about 3 per cent of their outstanding
loans.
However, Mr Mieno warned that individual banks which were particularly
exposed would face painful restructuring.
In a wide-ranging review of the economy the central bank governor said the
Bank of Japan was facing a challenge without precedent in the post-war era:
to maintain the stability of the financial system while securing
non-inflationary growth after the excesses of the speculative bubble
economy.
Comparing the rate at which Japanese and US banks were clearing up their bad
debts, Mr Mieno said Japanese banks needed to step up their efforts and make
them public to win back trust in the country's banking system.
He emphasised that the Bank of Japan would not offer the commercial banks
any quick fixes. 'The banks must resist looking for any easy way out. They
must do this through self help,' he said.
Mr Mieno said the central bank's role was to create a conducive environment
for the banks to restructure, providing liquidity if necessary to support
troubled institutions.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Japan Responds to Downturn: LDP has new plan to boost
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ruling Liberal Democratic party, working closely with Japan's most
powerful economic bureaucrats has drawn up a timetable for further measures
to stimulate the economy, once the budget for 1993 is passed, according to
senior officials familiar with the plans.
The measures are largely the result of intensive talks behind the scenes
over the past few weeks between Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the head of an LDP
economic task force, Mr Mamoru Ozaki, the powerful vice-minister at the
finance ministry and Mr Eisuke Hamamoto, director general of the ministry's
tax bureau.
The finance ministry officials have swung Mr Mitsuzuka away from an early
cut in income taxes by suggesting that tax cuts targeted at capital
investment and housing would be more effective.
The powerful economic bureaucracy and the political leadership of prime
minister Kiichi Miyazawa agree the next few months will be critical, either
laying the foundations for moderate economic recovery later in the year or
confirming pessimistic forecasts of a prolonged period of slow growth.
The lower house of parliament will pass the mildly expansionary budget for
1993 early next month. Tokyo is then expected to announce that all public
works spending will be brought forward from the second half into the first
half of the year to maintain the strong growth in public investment, rising
by an annual rate of about 11 per cent.
There is expected to be a five stage timetable for fresh measures to
stimulate the economy, most of which parliament could pass before its
current session ends on June 20. This would allow Japan to present the
entire stimulus package to the Group of Seven Tokyo summit scheduled for
early July.
The LDP will propose tax cuts for investment and housing. It may also
propose relaxing the rules governing public borrowing to allow public bodies
to buy computers and other electronic goods.
A decision on whether to cut income taxes will be delayed until April and
May to allow time to see whether the economy is recovering or whether it
needs further stimulus.
The finance ministry and the Bank of Japan want to avoid repeating past
mistakes such as in early 1987 when overstimulation started the inflation
which led to the bubble economy of the late 1980s.
A further interest rate cut later in the year has not been ruled out. The
Bank of Japan, which recently cut its official discount rate to an all time
low of 2.5 per cent has refrained from suggesting that this will be the last
cut.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the bank's governor yesterday emphasised that interest
rate policy would be guided by the state of the real economy. 'We have to
focus upon the real economy. If necessary we have to resolve to cut interest
rates.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / Pay deal for east German workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IG CHEMIE, Germany's chemical, paper and ceramics union, agreed to a 9 per
cent wage increase for its 100,000 members in eastern Germany following
arbitration talks which ended yesterday.
But IG Metall, the giant engineering union, yesterday said it would start
holding demonstrations throughout east Germany unless its members were
promised a 26 per cent pay increase in line with its timetable for parity
with western workers by 1994.
IG Chemie's pay rise falls short of the union's demand for a wage increase
which would match east German inflation, running at an annual rate of about
11.5 per cent, but is more than the 7.5 per cent originally offered by the
employers' association.
Mr Bernd Leibfried, the spokesman for IG Chemie, said the 13-month
agreement, which will be backdated to February 1, would bring wages in
eastern Germany's chemical sector up from 62 per cent to 70 per cent of west
German levels.
Last week IG Bergbau and Energie, the energy and utilities union, accepted a
9.3 per cent rise. Neither has sought income parity between east and west
German workers by 1994, unlike IG Metall.
In March 1991 it agreed with Gesamtmetall, the employers' association, to
income parity by April of next year. But Gesamtmetall pulled out of the
contract, saying economic conditions had changed.
IG Metall said demonstrations would start tomorrow in the car manufacturing
region of Ludwigsfelde, south-west of Berlin.
The pay talks come amid rising job losses in east German industry, where
employment fell by 40 per cent last year. Manufacturing and mining were the
hardest hit, according to federal statistics.
Employment in the sector in the whole of Germany was 9.5 per cent down in
December 1992 over 1991, or from 7.46m workers to 7.12m a year before.
Registered unemployment is expected to exceed 18 per cent.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Spanish money market rates rise: Devaluation fears as
pressure continues on the peseta in ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPANISH money market rates rose sharply yesterday amid continuing pressures
on the peseta within the European exchange rate mechanism.
The cost of borrowing Spanish pesetas for one month rose to around 20 per
cent yesterday, amid fears on financial markets that the currency may be
forced to devalue within the ERM.
The Bank of Spain yesterday left its official money market intervention rate
unchanged at 13 per cent, despite the rise in money market rates in the
morning. Later in the day the bank was forced to provide daily funds to the
market at an average rate of 15.32 per cent, compared with 14.61 per cent on
Monday.
Throughout yesterday the Bank of Spain defended the beleaguered peseta with
aggressive purchases of the currency. The developments appeared to have
gained a certain breathing space for the peseta which steadied yesterday at
Pta72.50 to the D-Mark against a Monday close of Pta72.95.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, also came to the peseta's
aid with a statement that pledged a 'rigorous observance' of the convergence
criteria leading to economic and monetary union and discounted any
temptation to abandon the European exchange rate mechanism.
'(The peseta's) permanence in the European monetary system is beyond all
doubt and so also is its discipline within the exchange rate and monetary
policies,' Mr Gonzalez said.
In what amounted to a fine balancing act, the bank was able to keep its
benchmark money rate unchanged at yesterday's routine auction of
certificates of deposit because the shortage of liquidity in the domestic
system ensured punitive lending rates on the inter-bank market. One-day
rates rose as high as 22 per cent and those for three-month Euro-pesetas
were above 16 per cent.
Some currency dealers had forecast the bank would raise its intervention
rate back up to 13.25 per cent, where it stood earlier this month before the
Bundesbank eased its interest rates, or even higher. Although the peseta,
which has a 6 per cent fluctuation band within the ERM, remains well off its
Pta77.28 to the D-Mark floor in the mechanism, the Bank of Spain appears
determined to prevent any downward slide much beyond its Pta72.70 parity. Mr
Gonzalez' stout defence of the ERM is in line with orthodox economic
thinking in Spain that seeks to use the mechanism's constraints to wring as
much inflation as possible out of the domestic economy.
'Exit from the ERM means stop and go, boom and bust,' said Mr Jaime de
Pinies, head of research at Banco Santander de Negocios.
Currency speculators, however, seem to be betting on the government's
inability to resist mounting pressure to refire the economy following a
recent string of depressing statistics that included an unemployment total
of just over 3m, or 20 per cent of the labour force. The Madrid stock market
index was down by more than 4 points yesterday to close at 227.92, a drop of
nearly 2 per cent and one of its heaviest falls this year.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Poland poised to be a post-communist success story: But
eastern Europe's beacon of stability is showing signs of strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POST-COMMUNIST Europe needs a success story. It is beginning to look as
though Poland, which was the first to shake off the communist yoke and the
first to embark on 'shock therapy' economic reforms, might provide one.
After three years of industrial decline when production slumped 40 per cent
and unemployment climbed from zero to 13 per cent of the workforce, the
economy stabilised last year. Strong export growth to western markets, a
fast growing private sector and signs of greater efficiency in the public
sector have combined to produce sharp productivity gains and the basis of an
export-led economy. Poland appears poised for sustained economic growth
which the government hopes will double GDP over the next decade.
But the pain is far from over. Officially, more than 40 per cent of Polish
families survived at minimum income levels last year, according to central
planning office figures. These underestimate the extent of moon-lighting and
the under-reporting of real wage and profit levels for tax evasion purposes.
But there are also clear signs of social strain. Last year the birth rate
was the lowest in 50 years and the death rate was at its highest since the
second world war. A third of the population, around 13m people, live in
ecologically risky areas. Official unemployment, while slackening in pace,
is still rising; it will exceed 3m, or 16 per cent of the work force, before
hopefully peaking later this year, provided the slowdown in Germany and the
rest of EC markets does not curb export-led job creation.
There is a sense that the worst is over and that a period of economic and
social development lies ahead.
Production is rising at the new foreign and Polish-owned plants that are
mushrooming. State-owned enterprises are also responding to market
disciplines introduced over the last three years.
It is not only central Warsaw that gives the impression of a boom-town, with
aircraft and hotels full of western businessmen, streets crowded with
imported cars and increasingly sophisticated shops. Economic activity and
change in neighbouring countries - such as Ukraine and Germany - are
fuelling Poland's entrepreneurial activity. The eastern border has become,
in effect, the new border between east and west, although as the recent
35-nation interior ministers meeting in Budapest revealed, this is not a
status with which Warsaw is happy. Poland as seen from the east now looks
like a beacon of stability and modest prosperity. The fear is that the
country will attract economic refugees like moths to a light if the economic
and political situation to the east deteriorates, as looks probable.
Warsaw has its own problems. It has to keep the budget deficit within the 5
per cent of GDP level agreed with the International Monetary Fund. This
means a tight rein on spending, the introduction of VAT and measures to
broaden its tax base and improve tax collection.
Next month the IMF is expected to approve a Dollars 660m standby loan whose
symbolic importance far exceeds its financial value. A new agreement will be
seen as a vote of confidence in Poland's ability to maintain stable
government and pursue structural reforms.
The three years of deep recession which followed the 'shock therapy' imposed
by Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the then finance minister, killed hyper-inflation
and forced Polish companies to seek new export markets in the west. This
process was re-inforced by the subsequent collapse in trade with the former
Soviet Union. Since the middle of last year, however, the first tentative
signs of an upturn in industrial production and economic growth have
multiplied.
Until now Poland, the most populous of the former Soviet satellites with an
internal market of 39m people, has received far less foreign investment than
Hungary or the Czech Republic. but has the most entrepreneurial private
sector. But unlike its neighbours it is spared the ethnic tensions which
have split Czechoslovakia, complicated Hungary's relations with its
neighbours and led to civil war in Yugoslavia and along the southern borders
of Russia.
The growth potential of Poland is attracting attention from strategic
investors, including US and European pension funds and other institutions.
Next month's expected IMF agreement will unlock more than Dollars 1bn in
structural adjustment loans from the World Bank, permit completion of the
second stage of the Paris Club agreement on a 50 per cent reduction in
Poland's Dollars 33bn official debt, and facilitate negotiations with the
London Club for a similar reduction in more than Dollars 12bn of commercial
debt.
The IMF agreement is also expected to facilitate redeployment of the
untouched Dollars 1bn zloty stabilisation fund created by donations and
loans from the US and other western governments in 1990 to underpin zloty
convertibility. It was not needed but now Warsaw is trying to persuade
donors that the fund should be converted to clean up bank balance sheets
prior to privatisation.
The climate for private investment is also expected to improve. The largest
single project to date is Fiat's Dollars 2bn commitment to build small cars
in Poland. This has attracted matching investments from Fiat's traditional
suppliers, including Dollars 200m from Lucchini which is modernising the
Huta Warszawa steel plant, and smaller machine tool and component companies
attracted by Poland's low wage costs and high skill levels.
More than 50 per cent of output now comes from the private sector which
employs 56 per cent of the labour force. International Paper, Pilkington and
Unilever are three of the lengthening list of multinational investors. while
increasingly Poland is attracting smaller investors such as a Danish shoe
company which is setting up three plants there. They employ 150 people each
at wages comparable to the Far East and the company is also buying cheap,
high quality Polish hides. As with other EC producers the Danish company
finds it cheaper and more efficient to sew leather uppers to soles in Poland
and ship the finished goods by truck than spend a fortune on air-freight.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Boutros Ghali agrees on US air-drops to Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A US plan to drop relief supplies into blockaded areas of eastern
Bosnia-Hercegovina appears likely to go ahead by the end of this week after
President Bill Clinton won the agreement of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the
United Nations secretary-general.
Mr Boutros Ghali, who had earlier voiced doubts about the plan, said he was
in complete agreement with Mr Clinton after a meeting yesterday at the White
House. 'There is no problem. This will be done in complete co-operation,' Mr
Boutros Ghali said.
Asked if he believed there was a danger the relief mission could lead to
escalated violence, Mr Boutros Ghali said: 'No. . . we will take all of the
precautions to avoid any kind of an escalation.'
President Clinton said that the operation he planned was 'purely
humanitarian and quite limited,' with 'no combat connotations whatever'. His
remarks appeared designed to soothe the Serbian commanders, who had warned
yesterday that the move could escalate the fighting in the country.
'The airdrop would almost certainly pave the way to the massive use of
military force and the spread of armed conflict with unforeseeable
consequences,' General Milan Gvero, the deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb
army, said.
In a strongly-worded statement, Mr Iljija Djukic, the Yugoslav foreign
minister, warned the US against violating its borders. While stressing that
Yugoslavia, now comprised of Serbia and Montenegro, shared the humanitarian
concern for besieged Moslems, Mr Djukic said: 'Yugoslavia will not hinder
the realisation of the operation, but it will not tolerate the violation of
Yugoslav territory and airspace.' He said the Yugoslav army was not involved
in the civil war in Bosnia, but feared incidents in the republic could veer
out of control.
Meanwhile, the US has informed its Nato allies that it plans to go ahead
with the air-drop towards the end of this week, following consultations
between Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, and his Nato
colleagues at a meeting in Brussels on Friday.
The White House made clear the administration wanted allied backing for the
relief effort. Though the plan has been welcomed by the UN Security Council
and most of Washington's allies - and Turkey and Holland have offered to
participate in the operation - it has caused misgivings in both the US and
some allied defence establishments.
Aviation experts warned that, if the aircraft were to fly high enough to
reduce the risk of groundfire, they would be unable to target their drops
accurately. 'You're going to get some material in the hands of good guys,
and some of it, maybe most of it, in the hands of the bad guys,' said Rear
Admiral Eugene Carroll, of the Center for Defence Information, a Washington
defence policy research group.
Pentagon officials privately acknowledge that they have themselves put
forward this argument, but have been overruled because of the
administration's desire to demonstrate support for the Bosnians, having
failed to come up with a viable alternative peace plan to that presented by
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.
Britain has adopted an ambivalent attitude to the US plan. While formally
welcoming it, Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, yesterday said that
the RAF would not participate in an operation to drop relief supplies.
Downing Street described the US plan as 'complementary' to British
humanitarian aid efforts, using ground convoys. 'What is important is that
the US is getting into the aid operation in Bosnia,' the Foreign Office
said.
Yesterday the Bosnian Serb army said it would allow overland convoys to
deliver emergency aid to besieged Moslems. An envoy of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees reached Tuzla after being delayed by Serb troops,
but Serb fighters yesterday stopped another UNHCR convoy in Podromanija, 38
miles north of the besieged enclave of Gorazde.
Reuter adds from New York: Lt-Gen Satish Nambiar of India will shortly
relinquish command of the 23,000-strong UN Protection Force in former
Yugoslavia and is likely to be replaced by Lt-Gen Lars-Eric Wahlgren, of
Sweden, UN sources said.

<TEXT>
Railway workers in Silesia, Poland's most heavily industrialised region,
backed wage demands yesterday with a two-hour stoppage which disrupted local
passenger and freight traffic, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
They are demanding that wages for railway workers in the region, which
carries two-thirds of the country's freight traffic, should be 18 per cent
more than for rail employees elsewhere.
The stoppage comes after last week's successful 24-hour strike by miners in
the Solidarity trade union to demand that married people be taxed jointly on
their annual incomes, as was the case in 1992.
Meanwhile, Solidarity in the recession-hit textile town of Lodz, 120km west
of Warsaw, has called a 48-hour general strike beginning tomorrow to demand
the appointment of a special government official to oversee restructuring
plans for the area.

DR Horst Jannott, chief executive of Munchener Ruckversicherung, the world's
largest reinsurance company, died unexpectedly on Sunday, writes David
Waller in Frankfurt.
Dr Jannott joined Munich Re in 1954 and has been chief executive since 1969,
only the sixth chief executive since the company was founded in 1880. Gross
premium at the group has grown from DM300m when he first started to nearly
DM16bn (Pounds 6.7bn) in 1991-92.
Dr Jannott, who was 65, was due to step down from his position as chief
executive on March 1 to become chairman of the company's supervisory board.
Personally self-effacing, Dr Jannott , was a central figure in German
business life, an eminence grise who was chairman of four supervisory boards
and a member of the supervisory boards of eight large companies, including
Degussa, Dresdner Bank, Hoechst, MAN, Mannesmann and Veba.
He is to be succeeded as chairman of the board of managing directors (chief
executive) at Munich Re by Dr Hans-Jurgen Schinzler, 52, Dr Jannott's
deputy, for a number of years and the group's finance director since 1981.

FT  24 FEB 93 / EC and weather hit agrochemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR WEATHER and the reforms of the EC's common agricultural policy that
oblige cereal farmers to set aside 15 per cent of their land led to a
decline in west Europe's agrochemicals market in 1992.
The market, the world's largest, fell 2 per cent to Dollars 7.29bn (Pounds
5.13bn), according a report* prepared by Allan Woodburn Associates, the
specialist market research group. However, the drop was worse - at about 5
per cent - in local currencies. In real terms, including inflation, the fall
was between 9 per cent and 10 per cent.
The decline was mostly weather-related, said Mr Allan Woodburn, director. In
the summer it was too dry in southern Europe, and too wet in northern Europe
last autumn. He warned that the full impact of the CAP reforms would only be
seen during 1993. The report estimated the reforms would eventually lead to
a decline in the European market of between 15 and 20 per cent by 1996. Last
week Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, Rhone-Poulenc's chief executive, said the fall
could be up to 30 per cent.
Fungicide manufacturers are likely to be most affected, according to the
report. Herbicide demand is expected to be less severely hit.
The European insecticides market is small and more likely to be hit by the
weather than by CAP reforms. The groups most affected by the downturn are
those with the highest proportion of turnover in Europe, according to Mr
Woodburn. These include Schering of Germany (60 per cent of sales in the
region); Rhone-Poulenc of France (51 per cent); Hoechst of Germany (42 per
cent); and Bayer of Germany (37 per cent).
The report said Ciba-Geigy remained the world market-leader. Zeneca
(turnover Dollars 1.97bn) has been overtaken for the second spot by Bayer
(Dollars 2.05bn), almost entirely because of exchange rates.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Amato challenges critics with confidence vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, will seek a vote of
confidence in parliament later this week to force the four parties in his
coalition to publicly demonstrate their support following the weekend
cabinet reshuffle.
Such support is needed to allay fears of waning enthusiasm for Mr Amato from
elements with the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties, the two main
partners in the fragile coalition. These fears, accentuated by Mr Amato's
inability to move Mr Giuseppe Guarino, the industry minister, in the
reshuffle, led to further falls in the lira yesterday.
The Socialist prime minister has used the confidence vote to good effect to
bring his fragile coalition into line on several occasions during his eight
months in office.
Yesterday he challenged parliament to come up with an alternative
government, adding: 'If this is not possible, then it is both necessary and
urgent that the government be able to get going again with all its energy in
a climate of certainty.'
This approach is a reversal of his stand immediately after the reshuffle on
Sunday when he ruled out such a vote. He argued the ministerial changes were
limited and policy was unaltered since the former communists of the
Democratic Left unsuccessfully brought a motion of no confidence at the
beginning of the month.
Mr Amato must also contend with a cabinet which contains a minister clearly
identified as the odd man out - Mr Guarino, the independent-minded
constitutional lawyer in the industry portfolio. Mr Amato sought at the
weekend to move him because he was holding up privatisation. Mr Guarino was
offered the education or science ministries but refused to budge. An Italian
premier can only sack ministers in a complete change of government. This is
the first occasion a minister has not resigned under such circumstances.
Yesterday, Sole 24 Ore, the leading financial daily, said it was so
disgusted by Mr Guarino's behaviour that in future the minister would not be
referred to by name.
Mr Guarino yesterday stressed his willingness to work with the cabinet, but
his position remains anomalous.
It is also potentially destabilising as he has the backing of some powerful
members of the old-guard in the Christian Democrat party.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Giscard says utilities not for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S big 'monopoly' utilities run no risk of being privatised, Mr Valery
Giscard d'Estaing, leader of one of the centre-right opposition parties
tipped to win next month's parliamentary election, said yesterday.
All companies in the competitive sector could be privatised, Mr Giscard
d'Estaing said, 'but there are no plans to privatise the big companies in a
position of monopoly' in such areas as telecommunications, transport or
energy.
The ex-president of France thus removed the ambiguity left in his Democratic
Union (UDF) party's recent joint programme with the Republican Assembly
(RPR) Gaullists. This stated that 'all banks, insurance companies and
enterprises in the competitive sector will be privatised', leaving undefined
what the opposition considered 'non-competitive'.
France Telecom, Electricite de France (EdF), and Gaz de France (GdF) are
probably profitable enough to be sold, but have been used as instruments of
industrial policy.
Reacting to pressure from Brussels for a liberalised electricity market, EdF
has commissioned a study of the privatisation of the UK electricity industry
which is due to be unveiled here today. The study is expected to be critical
of the British energy sell-off which, however, appears to have benefited the
French utility. Out of its total 54.8bn kW/hours of power exports last year,
EdF sold 17bn to the UK.
Even while keeping utilities in state hands, Mr Giscard d'Estaing forecast
that the stock market would be able to bear privatisation of the order of
FFr40bn (Pounds 5bn) this year and FFr60bn in each of the two following
years. Proceeds would be used to reduce public debt and taxes.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Reluctance of leaders threatens peace settlement
negotiations

   NEW YORK,, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE negotiations for a peace settlement in Bosnia, which have been stalled
for the past three weeks, are in serious danger of having to be wound up
altogether in the absence of two of the three leaders of the warring
factions. Doubts about an early resumption of the talks in the UN increased
last night as a lawsuit against one of the key participants threatened to
delay his arrival in New York.
However Lord Owen the EC mediator, still voiced confidence that Mr Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serbian leader, who is the object of the legal action,
would return.
'Certainly it is necessary now to get the leaders as quickly as possible
here and I think it can be cleared up,' he told reporters.
A 'more complicated situation', he added, was that of President Alija
Izetbegovic of Bosnia, who might need some strong persuasion to drop his
reluctance to attend the talks. Mr Izetbegovic was due to meet US
Vice-President Al Gore in Washington this week and then go on to New York
for the peace talks, but reports from Sarajevo said he might not make the
trip.
Mr Karadzic is threatened with a multi-million dollar civil class action
that three US human rights organisations filed in a New York court 11 days
ago, charging him with responsibility for atrocities carried out by forces
under his control in Bosnia. Mr David Larner, a spokesman for the
plaintiffs, said last night that any grants of immunity would be challenged
in Federal court, although he acknowledged that Mr Karadzic need not fear
arrest while he was in the US.
When he led the Bosnian Serb delegation to the peace talks earlier this
month, Mr Karadzic's movements were restricted by the US immigration
authorities to six blocks from the United Nations building and several
hotels indicated he was an unwelcome visitor.
He has made it clear that he would much prefer the talks to return to Geneva
and that he was unwilling to return to New York unless his security could be
guaranteed, possibly through a personal invitation from Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the UN secretary-general.

A United Nations convoy nears the besieged town of Gorazde, taking food and
medicine to 70,000 Bosnian Moslems who have received no aid since
mid-January because of a blockade by Serbs.
The US has told its Nato allies that it will go ahead this week with its
plan to air drop supplies to the blockaded areas of eastern Bosnia. Britain
welcomed the plan but said British aircraft would not take part in the
operation. The deputy commander of the Bosnian Serb army, General Milan
Gvero, said the air-drop would lead to a massive use of force and the spread
of armed conflict in Bosnia.

FT  24 FEB 93 / Manchester wins right to stage chess championship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER yesterday won its battle to stage the next world chess
championship between Gary Kasparov, the reigning champion, and Nigel Short,
the British challenger, with a bid placed just seven minutes before the
deadline.
The city's final offer of SFr2.538m (Pounds 1.16m) beat two rival British
bids, and one from the Spanish city of Santiago de Compostela. The bookish
Short, Britain's first world championship contender, will meet Kasparov, the
world's highest-ever ranked player, in the Royal Exchange Theatre in August.
Manchester, bidding to host the 2000 Olympic Games, will hope to rekindle
the excitement generated by the highly publicised 1972 match between Russian
Boris Spassky and American Bobby Fischer in Reykjavik in Iceland.
The personalities in the Short-Kasparov clash are likely to match
Spassky-Fischer in terms of animosity at least. Short has said the Georgian
world champion is overbearing. Kasparov, when asked about the match,
replied: 'It will be Short and it will be short.'
Although Iceland paid just Dollars 125,000 (Pounds 88,000) in 1972, it
believes it reaped a rich reward from the Spassky-Fischer tournament through
increased tourism, and is still enjoying the spinoffs.
'It got us total attention in the media at that time - that is something
that was very helpful for us or for any city,' said Mr Magnus Oddson,
marketing director of the Icelandic tourist board.
Although not the highest, Manchester's was the only British bid to conform
to the complex sponsorship rules of Fide, the world chess governing body,
which stipulate that bids must be unconditional, in Swiss francs and backed
by a bank guarantee.
International Management Group, a sports management agency, and Channel 4
television offered SFr2.616m but failed to provide a bank guarantor and
demanded conditions attached to world TV rights, exclusive daily interviews
with the players and the right to stage matches anywhere.
The other British bid - from the London Chess Group, a coalition of
London-based companies co-ordinated by a public relations group - was for
Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 1.05m), but also failed to meet Fide's conditions.
Manchester Airport will be the sole sponsor of the eight-week championship.
Although Mr Short lives in London, he was born and brought up in Greater
Manchester, so will be on home ground.

FT  24 FEB 93 / UK regions risk losing Pounds 1bn in EC aid dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S most depressed industrial regions risk losing about Pounds 1bn in
EC aid as a result of a row between the European Commission and the UK
government over what Brussels claims is Whitehall's failure to provide
matching finance.
Mr Bruce Millan, EC regional policy commissioner, has written to the British
government seeking talks to resolve the dispute.
His move follows complaints from local authorities to Brussels that London
is not 'matching' EC regional grants with equivalent funds, as required by
the unanimously approved Community rules.
Last night the Department of Trade and Industry in London said the EC's
funds would be matched but 'final details' on the grants had to be finalised
between Whitehall departments.
Officials confirmed that a letter had been received by Sir John Kerr, the UK
permanent representative, and said a reply had already been sent.
The latest row over regional funds for industrially stricken regions such as
Merseyside and Strathclyde comes as the government faces pressure to act on
unemployment which hit 3m last week.
The government agreed last February, after a prolonged row which divided the
cabinet, to abide by EC rules from this April. The government also agreed to
ensure that adequate 'matching' funds were provided to the regions in the
interim in order to secure financing from Brussels.
The funds earmarked for UK regions are worth Ecu1.26bn (Pounds 1.04bn) for
1992-93.
The Commission had withheld for over a year Ecu160m in regional funding to
regenerate British coalmining areas. These were only released when the
previous row was settled with Britain shortly before last year's general
election.
A senior EC regional policy official said there had been 'a slight
improvement' since then, but that 'we are getting too many complaints that
they are not releasing the money'. He added: 'We are reaching the point when
we have to react; they are making fools of us.'
Another official said there was 'concern that the UK is not going to be able
to take up the (EC) money, and that they will lose it at the end of the
year,' when the current regional policy programme is replaced by a
seven-year scheme.
The Commission has maintained that a significant portion of EC aid to
targeted UK regions is leaking out to other local authorities which are
ineligible, because it all goes into a single Treasury pot. The UK argued
that this was merely an accounting difference but last year pledged greater
'transparency'.
Yesterday, however, in a memorandum before today's Commission discussion on
the Ecu141.4bn 1994-99 structural aid programme, the regional policy
directorate said: 'There is no justification for treating Community
resources as being there merely to 'reimburse' national funds which would
otherwise have been spent.'
Government departments in Whitehall have been engaged in a so far unresolved
wrangle over how to highlight in the national accounts EC funds that are
additional to normal spending.
Opinion has veered towards a system that would mean each department
specifying in its annual budget the amount of funds coming from Brussels.
But some departments have been reluctant to separate EC from national
spending.
Whitehall's problem has been complicated by the need to decide the amounts
of funds which should pass into the ambit of a specific department. As
England has no structure of regional government, EC funds pass through
individual departments on their way to individual projects.

FT  24 FEB 93 / British Coal criticised on pits plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL failed to follow its own guidelines in selecting two of 10 pits
earmarked for immediate closure last October, according to a confidential
report commissioned by the government.
The findings in the draft report, by John T. Boyd, the US mining
consultancy, provide the latest in a series of blows to British Coal over
its programme to close up to 31 pits.
The report said Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire and Taff Merthyr in Mid
Glamorgan were closed even though they did not meet the two closure criteria
of being unviable in the foreseeable future and lossmaking.
Boyd said Grimethorpe was profitable historically and could remain so
'providing a market is available'. It said Taff Merthyr in Mid Glamorgan was
closed even though it was viable in the immediate future. However, Boyd does
not recommend reopening it because of its limited reserves.
British Coal is already embroiled in a legal battle with unions over the
future of the 10. In December, High Court judges ruled illegal the decision
by British Coal and the government to close the 10, which have already
ceased production, and the other 21 which are under threat.
The government wants to use the Boyd report as the basis for an independent
assessment of the prospects for the 10 pits ordered by the court. Unions
have rejected the idea that Boyd is independent, but will point to the
report for what they see as evidence of wrong decisions.
British Coal will, however, take comfort from the report's conclusion,
disputed by unions, that the fabric of all 10 pits is being maintained in
accordance with assurances given by British Coal to the High Court.
This means that in theory any of the 10 pits could be reopened, although
this seems remote for all but Grimethorpe and Betws, South Wales.
The report believes Betws could thrive in the private sector, although all
the economically recoverable coal, using British Coal's mining procedures,
is depleted. 'This is not to discount the ability of a private mining
company successfully to operate a salvageable . . . system,' the report
says. British Coal made no comment on the report yesterday but is likely to
dispute the finding. It will argue Grimethorpe is not viable because it
shares facilities with Houghton Main, another of the 10.
In addition, British Coal will argue that, even if Grimethorpe is
potentially viable, the market constraints will work against it having a
future. The government is struggling to find a market even for the 21 pits
which British Coal considers more viable. Boyd says: 'If there is not a
market. . . a colliery is not viable regardless of cost of production.'

FT  24 FEB 93 / Japan acts to aid recovery as top groups shed 35,000 jobs

<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government and three of the country's top companies yesterday
separately took steps to respond to the most deep-seated economic crisis the
country has faced since the second world war.
Nissan, one of the world's top five vehicle makers, and NTT, the
telecommunications group, said they would shed 35,000 jobs between them over
the next three years.
The job cuts came at the same time as news that the board of Matsushita, the
world's largest electronics group which faces a steep fall in profits, had
forced the resignation of its president. The move shook Japan's
traditionally conservative business community where corporate changes tend
to be orderly.
The corporate shake-ups coincided with a decision by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, and other top policymakers in the ruling Liberal Democratic
party to draw up further measures to stimulate the economy.
These are likely to include bringing forward public works spending and tax
incentives for housing and capital investment, once the budget for 1993
passes through parliament next month.
The move confirms that the government believes the economy is still
deteriorating despite the Y10,700bn (Pounds 62.8bn) emergency package
announced last summer. The economic downturn has spread to embrace finance
and industry in every region.
Gross national product grew at only 1.1 per cent in the third quarter of
last year, over the same period in 1991. Machine tool orders last year fell
by 37.8 per cent and industrial production generally, fell by 6.1 per cent.
Bank lending grew by just 2 per cent in January, the same rate as in the
previous two months.
The gathering sense of gloom was reinforced by Mr Yasushi Mieno, the
governor of the Bank of Japan, who repeated his call to Japan's banks to
speed up moves to write off their mounting bad debts. Mr Mieno, in a speech
to business leaders in Tokyo, confirmed that Japan's banks face their worst
crisis since the second world war. He urged them to rapidly strengthen their
balance sheets by writing off bad debts and raising new equity to make sure
they could create the credit to finance economic recovery.
The restructuring plans unveiled by Japan's corporate sector yesterday
included:
NTT, the world's largest telecommunications group will shed 30,000 of its
workforce of more than 200,000 over the next three years and cut by a third
its 1,300 retail outlets. NTT reported a 22 per cent fall in pre-tax profits

Nissan plans to close a production plant near Tokyo by the spring of 1995
and reduce its workforce of 53,000 by 5,000 by 1996 as part of a plan to
save Y200bn. Nissan said it would make a pre-tax loss of Y29bn in the year
to the end of March.
Matsushita may introduce similar changes after its board yesterday suddenly
removed its president Mr Akio Tanii. He will be replaced by Mr Yoichi
Morishita, the vice-president. The company reported a 63 per cent fall in
pre-tax income for the nine months to the end of December.
The government's index of leading indicators for December published
yesterday suggested little hope of an early upturn. It stood at 27 per cent,
the ninth consecutive month below the 50 per cent threshold which signals
that the economy will expand.

<TEXT>
TAIWAN will seek aerospace technology from the US as part of its purchase of
150 F-16 jet fighters for about Dollars 6bn, Taiwanese officials said
yesterday, Reuter reports.
The government will ask General Dynamics, which makes the aircraft, to
provide local companies with technology to repair and produce parts when
company executives visit Taiwan early next month.
'Such an offset agreement would not only expand business opportunities for
our companies, but help us improve maintenance for military aircraft,' said
Mr David Chu, head of the Taiwanese cabinet's Committee for Aviation and
Space Industry Development.
The US gave permission last September for the F-16s to be sold to Taiwan.
Taiwan's parliament approved the first instalment of the purchase price last
month, but adopted a resolution requiring the government to negotiate
technology transfers that would let Taiwanese companies produce parts worth
at least 10 per cent of the contract.
The island is eager to develop its fledgling aerospace industry.

<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration yesterday appointed a new co-ordinator of US aid
to the former Soviet Union, less than a week after the current co-ordinator
said Russian President Boris Yeltsin's days in power were numbered, Reuter
reports from Washington.
The new co-ordinator is Mr Thomas Simons, the US ambassador to Poland, who
will replace Mr Richard Armitage, a Bush appointee who is likely to stay in
office until April or May.
The administration has sought to distance itself from comments by Mr
Armitage that he expected Mr Yeltsin to be ousted before his presidential
term ends in 1996.
When asked whether Mr Armitage's remarks had hastened Mr Simons'
appointment, a State Department spokesman said the administration had been
working for a month on appointing a new co-ordinator to work for Mr Strobe
Talbott, President Bill Clinton's designated ambassador-at-large to the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
The spokesman said Mr Simons would take over from Mr Armitage 'as soon as he
can wind up affairs in Poland'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRATION talks between Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers
association, and IG Metall, Germany's engineering union, yesterday broke
down in the east German state of Mecklenburg-western Pomerania.
The collapse of the talks, which follows a similar pattern in the four other
east German states, now means that IG Metall will have to decide which steps
to take in its demand for a wage increase of 26 per cent for its members in
eastern Germany.
As expected, Gesamtmetall insisted that it could not afford such a rise, and
offered a 9 per cent increase. IG Metall said Gesamtmetall was effectively
breaking the contract agreed in March 1991 which would bring wages up to the
level of their west German counterparts by April 1994.
East German wages in the engineering sector are currently 70 per cent of
west German levels. Gesamtmetall offficials yesterday said the wage increase
would reflect the lower productivity levels, and income parity should
perhaps be phased in gradually, even beyond 1994.
IG Metall, fearing that if it makes a substantial compromise it will
undermine Germany's centralised wage bargaining system, now has three
options. It can now go to the courts and prove that Gesamtmetall has broken
the contract, it can ask its members to approach the courts individually if
they do not receive the 26 per cent pay rise on April 1, when it was due, or
it can call a strike.
But a trend towards lower wage settlements in other sectors of the economy
does not bode well. IG Metall membership of 300,000 could shrink further,
particularly since more than half work in industries still held by the
Treuhand, the agency overseeing the privatisation of east German industry.
IG Chemie, which yesterday opened arbitration talks in Berlin, may be
prepared to settle for as low as 8 per cent. AVOC, the employer's
association, yesterday offered the union's 80,000 members 7.5 per cent,
effective from May, but with no back-date between January and April. But IG
Chemie said this represented an annual pay increase of 6.5 per cent, which
it sharply criticised. These talks are still continuing.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (9): Double decker glories - The arts
dance onwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY SAY that Americans seeking a weekend's cultural refreshment go
increasingly to Toronto rather than New York. It is not hard to see why.
There is a good feel to Toronto, purposeful without being pressured. The
downtown streets and subway are clean and safe to walk of an evening - and a
Toronto winter's night is generally more benign than Europeans imagine.
There is nothing, then, to inhibit a visitor in search of the cultural life
of the city.
Cats and Miss Saigon are both showing in Toronto. However, with some 40
other theatres and 140 professional theatre companies, Toronto is the
capital - after New York and London - of English language theatre. On Yonge
Street, close to record stores where Europeans greedily swallow up CDs for
CDollars 18 or less, theatregoers will discover a jewel: the Elgin and
Winter Garden Theatres.
This complex is the last surviving example of the double-decker theatres
which flourished in the heyday of vaudeville. Opened in 1913 the Winter
Garden transported its audience into an English country garden, with trompe
l'oeil paintings of stone walls, flowers and butterflies. After only 14
years the Winter Garden was shut up and forgotten while the Elgin became a
sleazy cinema. Five years ago this last gasp of Edwardiana was restored at a
cost of CDollars 30m and reopened (telephone (416) 963-3571 for theatre
bookings).
Down at the Harbourfront Centre on the shore of Lake Ontario, the Du Maurier
Theatre is hosting a world drama festival. At the nearby Dance Centre, dance
groups from all over the world are taking part in the CIBC Dance Season. Out
of town, the noted Shaw Festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake, 40 years old this
year, with three stages, is the largest repertory company in north America.
This year's programme starts on April 21 and includes Shaw's Saint Joan and
Coward's Blithe Spirit (telephone (416) 468-2172).
A sunset view of Toronto's financial centre is a memorable sight. The
Toronto Dominion Centre was designed by Mies Van der Rohe and built after
his death. The springing palm-tree vaults of Calatrava's Galeria at BCE
Place, and a magnificent 1930s bank in Egypto-Celtic style, are other
highlights. (To book an architectural walking tour, telephone (416)
922-7606.)
The Royal Ontario Museum opened in 1914, is a place of enchantment,
splendidly Victorian in its heterogeneity, with art and natural sciences
under one roof. Perhaps its chief glory is the Chinese collection, one of
the most magnificent in the world.
The fine arts scene is lively. At the Harbourfront, the Powerhouse gallery
hosts travelling shows of Canadian and foreign artists. The Art Gallery of
Ontario reopened last month; now literally twice the place it was. Designed
by Barton Myers Architects Inc and built in association with the local
partnership of Kuwabara, Payne, McKenna, Blumberg, the gallery is now one of
the largest in north America.
Many Toronto visitors count discovery of the Group of Seven, the famous
nationalistic movement in landscape painting founded in the 1920s, as one of
the city's great resources. A half hour from Toronto in the wooded hills of
the Humber Valley, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection is a shrine to
these artists and their contemporaries.
In September, Toronto's Festival of Festivals is the best-attended film
festival in the world. The city is also home to the Canadian Opera Company.
Brian Dickie, its director, was formerly general administrator at
Glyndebourne, and standards are high. Thus far without its own opera
theatre, the company uses the enormous O'Keefe Centre - or the Elgin Theatre
for more intimate works. The year's opera programme includes new productions
of Smetana's Bartered Bride and Mozart's Don Giovanni. The Toronto Symphony
Orchestra also uses the O'Keefe Centre. Telephone (416)-598-3375, or pick up
'Now', Toronto's weekly free arts scene listings magazine.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (7): Generating capacity glut - A look at
Ontario's powerhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONTARIO HYDRO, the powerhouse of Ontario's industrial might, is taking a
dramatic shift in direction to cope with zero demand growth.
The utility, owned by the provincial government, has long been a North
American technical leader and chief salesman for Canada's heavy-water
nuclear reactors. But more recently it has had to withstand withering
criticism from industry and consumers for steeply rising power rates.
Heavy cost overruns and start-up problems at its CDollars 15bn 3,600MW
Darlington nuclear plant near Toronto have raised questions about its
technical competence and financial management. Ontario Hydro's planners
over-estimated demand growth for the 1990s. They were caught on the wrong
foot when the Bank of Canada warned in 1988 it was aiming for zero-inflation
even at the risk of serious recession.
The result is a glut of generating capacity expected to last through the
year 2000, together with a 30 per cent three-year jump in electricity rates,
caused partly by financing Darlington over a 14-year construction period
without offsetting revenue.
Since 1989, during the worst recession since the 1930s, Ontario has seen
power demand shrink from a 5 per cent annual average increase to an actual
contraction. Far from buying more power from Ontario Hydro, industrial
consumers such as Falconbridge, the world's second biggest nickel producer,
and Chrysler Canada, with proportionately more output in Canada than Ford or
General Motors, want to build co-generation plants to fill their own needs
at lower cost.
'Hydro's been an excellent supplier for our mine and mill, helping us to
save energy, but it's done a terrible job on prices and we can generate the
power ourselves at lower cost,' says Mr Warren Holmes, president of
Falconbridge's Kidd Creek division.
Industrial users complain that the steep rise in rates is making the
recession worse and robbing Ontario of one of its key economic advantages:
low-cost energy to compensate for higher labour, construction and borrowing
costs, higher taxes and a cold climate. Hydro, with assets of nearly
CDollars 50-bn, debt of about CDollars 36bn and total system capacity of
33,000MW, says that Darlington's technical problems are over and all four
reactors should be operating fully by summer - four years late.
Furthermore, moves to adapt operations to slow or zero load-growth are now
being speeded up. Mr Maurice Strong, former business executive and organiser
of the 1991 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio, took over as chairman late
last year, just as the utility was caught in the eye of a political storm
over its rates. Mr Strong admits Ontario Hydro is 'in crisis', but says it
is moving swiftly to put its financial house in order. 'In a few years we
could be looking back to 1992-93 as the key transition point.'
The utility has scrapped its demand forecasts, cut capital spending and
trimmed its manpower. It is working on an overall cost-cutting programme. Mr
Strong promises that rate rises will be reined in to current inflation or
less, and that ways will be found to ease the CDollars 3.5bn annual interest
burden. A CDollars 3bn refurbishing of the Bruce A nuclear plant is being
reviewed, and some fossil-fuelled capacity is being mothballed.
A CDollars 13bn multi-year power purchase agreement with Manitoba Hydro has
been cancelled - and with it a large Western hydro-electric project. The
utility is trying to reduce its long-term uranium fuel costs.
A discussion paper will soon open the issues of privatisation and supply
monopoly to public debate. Britain's experience is being closely watched.
But the present social-democratic Government says it is not ready to support
privatisation. Private-sector co-generation projects, where surplus power
would be sold to Ontario Hydro, have been frozen, while industry and
municipal projects are considered.
For the first nine months of 1993, Ontario Hydro's revenues were CDollars
5.59bn - up 7 per cent, mainly because of higher rates. Sales of electricity
were stagnant. Operating costs rose modestly, but financing charges were
sharply up. Final net profit was CDollars 209m against CDollars 121m.
The utility borrowed heavily in domestic and international markets in 1992,
partly for refinancing at lower rates. Net new borrowing was about CDollars
2bn (it will decline in 1993 to about CDollars 1.4bn). With Darlington on
full stream, and existing coal and oil-fired and hydro capacity, the nuclear
component would meet 60 per cent of present demand.
Mr Allan Kupcis, the president, says that going ahead with 60 private power
projects would only put upward pressure on rates, because of the heavy cost
of closing equivalent Ontario Hydro capacity. 'We must hold the line on
current rates, and urgently rethink our cost structure. I mean a major
culture change. We're working frantically to change direction.'
He says the utility is suffering from the legacy of Darlington and poor
timing on investments in new plant. 'But surplus generating capacity, after
providing the normal reserve, is about 2,000MW - quickly absorbed with new
economic growth. I don't have any mega-projects in view.'
Capital spending is now running at about CDollars 2.5bn a year. The focus is
turning to refurbishing and upgrading the transmission and distribution
system.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (8): Green with controversy - 'Reduce,
re-use, recycle' are the watchwords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS AT the Ontario environment ministry in Toronto are required to sort
their litter into four separate containers. Three are for recyclable
materials: newspapers, other kinds of paper and aluminium soft-drink cans.
Whatever is left goes into the 'normal' rubbish bin.
There is a snag. In the ministry's zeal to cut down disposable waste, the
bin issued to each office is only the size of an indoor flower pot.
The 'three R's' - reduce, re-use, recycle - are the driving forces of
Ontario's environmental policies. The province has gained a reputation as
one of the world's 'greenest' jurisdictions.
The environment ministry makes the educated guess that more than four in
every five households in the province take part in a 'blue box' programme in
which newspapers, cans, plastic and other recyclable materials are separated
from other garbage. What is more, about 20 per cent of homes have composters
in their backyards for organic waste. The ministry claims that the province
now recycles more than half its newsprint and wood wastes, 40 per cent of
corrugated cardboard and a third of container glass.
The volume of garbage shipped to landfill sites is estimated to be between
20-25 per cent per person lower now than it was in 1987 (although it is not
clear how much is caused by environmental awareness, how much by recession).
Many programmes are voluntary and enforcement is still spotty, but the
variety of carrots and sticks used to raise standards and tighten
enforcement against polluters is steadily growing.
Penalties for environmental crimes are being stiffened. The head of an
Ontario chemicals company was sentenced to an eight-month jail term last
year. A fine of CDollars 364,000 was levied on a man found guilty of
illegally stockpiling scrap tyres.
Any company or government agency involved in an environmental assessment
must pay the costs of outside 'intervenors' who want to testify at a public
hearing, including those opposing its application. Less formally, a group of
private pilots volunteer, as part of their flying practice, to report
obvious signs of pollution around the province - such as an unfamiliar plume
of smoke or a dirty slick in a river.
But being in the vanguard of environmental policy inevitably brings
controversy.
Toronto municipal leaders are furious at the NDP government's decision to
veto the city's plans to transport its garbage by rail to a disused mine in
a remote part of northern Ontario. Although the northern community
enthusiastically supported the scheme, the province has decreed that
municipalities must seek solutions to their garbage problems closer to home.
A ban on solid-waste incineration by municipalities - the first of its kind
in North America - has by no means found universal favour, either.
The government has so far been more successful in forging a consensus for a
pioneering Environmental Bill of Rights, which would greatly increase public
participation in the review and enforcement of clean-up regulations.
According to Mr Peter Victor, a senior environment ministry official, the
bill is designed to increase political accountability in environmental
policy, with less emphasis on action through the courts. It will allow
members of the public, including businesses, to request a review of
government policies and regulations through an Environmental Commissioner,
accountable to the provincial legislature. The public could also ask the
commissioner to order an investigation of an alleged polluter.
The Bill of Rights would require the creation of a registry, probably
accessible through a computer terminal, to notify the public of all
significant environmental decisions, such as government permits and
regulations. In addition, the bill would protect 'whistle-blowing' employees
who report environmental abuses within their companies or public agencies.
Three private-sector representatives have endorsed a task force report on
the Bill of Rights. But the business community is withholding final judgment
until it sees the details of empowering legislation, expected to be tabled
this spring.
Mr Joe Couto, policy adviser to the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, says that
the governing New Democrats have watered down some of the positions they
advocated in opposition. 'They have realised that the environment doesn't
only belong to the environmentalists,' Mr Couto says.
A cornerstone of the effort to reduce liquid-waste pollution is the
Municipal and Industrial Strategy for Abatement (MISA). The first set of
guidelines, whose chief aim is to reduce the toxic content of effluents, was
put in force last year for the petroleum industry. Rules are now being drawn
up for another eight industries.
Among other initiatives is a compulsory environmental self-audit by large
companies and government agencies, including such places as hospitals and
shopping malls. Regulations, which are expected to come into force within
the next year or so, will require a biennial update of plans and targets to
reduce pollution.
A ministry official says that ways to enforce the audits have not yet been
determined. But participants will be required to keep their audits
continuously displayed for employees - and on file for spot checks by
government officials.
In general, Mr Victor says, the ministry tries 'to encourage voluntary
activity.'

Small, quality-driven wineries and shrewd marketing have put Ontario wines
on the map. Now the province's big three - TG Bright &amp; Co Ltd, Cartier Wines
&amp; Beverages Corp and Andres Wines Ltd - are joining them, emphasising
vinifera or hybrid vintages rather than bulk table wines. Today there are
more than 20 wineries in the Niagara Peninsula, a short drive from the
famous falls. Others are to be found on the north shore of nearby Lake Erie
and Pelee Island.
They include Inniskillin Wines Inc (now part of Cartier) which pioneered the
'boutique' trend in 1975; Hillebrand Winery Estates; Cave Spring Cellars
Ltd; Stonechurch Vineyards and Reif Winery Inc. In the 12 months to November
1992, Ontario produced 2.2m cases of wine, up from just over two million
cases a year earlier. About two-thirds of this was white wine, reflecting
consumers' preference for lighter drinks.
Ontario's climate - 'Algerian summers and Siberian winters,' says veteran
winemaker Paul Bosc of Chateau des Charmes - and wine-makers' technique come
together in icewine. This rare and expensive wine is one of the province's
specialties, winning prizes at international competitions such as Bordeaux's
VinExpo. To make it, the grapes are left on the vines after harvest time,
and the semi-dried fruit is picked only when the temperature drops below
minus 7C, usually just after Christmas. It is pressed while still frozen.
The result is a powerful essence of wine, concentrated but not over-sweet
despite its high residual sugar.
Last November, in a pre-Christmas promotion, the Liquor Control Board of
Ontario released icewines from 15 wineries. More than half the 2,800 cases
on offer have been sold, reports Chris Layton, spokesman for the Liquor
Control Board of Ontario, the monopoly that sells and distributes wine in
the province. Icewines, he says, are 'moving up quite well,' given the
recession and the high prices (about CDollars 35 to CDollars 50 a
half-bottle). Robert Joseph, editor of Britain's influential Wine magazine,
says Canadians have overtaken the Germans as masters of icewine-making
because of their attention to detail. 'When you make sweet wines,
wine-making skills pay off. The character of the grapes is less important.'
Such skills are also in evidence in other Ontario wines. 'Canadians are
producing more and more handcrafted wines,' Robert Joseph says. But because
Ontarian winemakers recognise the limitations of their climate, which is
something like Germany's (only more extreme), they are concentrating on
white wines, crafting Rieslings and Chardonnays which have drinkers coming
back for more. The problem now is to establish a distinctive character to
the wines - between the fat, buttery taste associated with California wines
and the steel of French Chablis.
Jean-Laurent Groux, the French-trained winemaker at Hillebrand Estates
Winery, in the Niagara Peninsula, is proud to describe his Chardonnays as
'Canadian,' with subtle essences of citrus and pear. He is also producing
impressive red wines, part of Hillebrand's Trius line of vineyard-designated
Cabernets and Chardonnays.
Ontario winemakers' credibility has been strengthened by the Vintners
Quality Association (VQA), a programme run with the provincial government.
Mr Don Ziraldo, a co-founder of Inniskillin, dreamed up the idea in the
mid-1980s. His original idea was for an alliance of small producers who
would concentrate on top quality wines. It has now been expanded to cover
Ontario's three main winegrowing areas. Modelled on the French appellation
controle system, the VQA has established strict criteria for certifying a
wine. Most important, wines must be made from varietal or hybrid grapes -
eliminating labruscas, which give Ontario wines their much maligned, foxy
taste.
Sales of VQA wines rose by 72 per cent in the year ending September 1992:
474,000 litres, up from 276,000 litres the previous year, according to the
Canadian Wine Institute. This helped to increase Ontario wines' market share
to 42 per cent - after years of losing ground to imports.
Inniskillin is represented in Britain by Averys of Bristol, and Hillebrand
is distributed through London-based wine merchants Corney &amp; Barrow, which
sells its barrel-aged Chardonnay and Brule blanc.

FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (4): Businesses back off - Dissatisfaction
has driven some companies south of the Canadian border, but others are doing
fine

SOME BUSINESSES are so disenchanted with Ontario that they have moved their
factories lock, stock and barrel elsewhere - invariably to the US or Mexico.
Tridon, a Canadian-owned maker of motor vehicle indicators, windshield
wipers and hose clamps, closed its Ontario operations in mid-1991 with the
loss of over 600 jobs. The same items are now produced at three plants near
Nashville, Tennessee.
Lawson Mardon, the packaging group controlled by Cragnotti and Partners of
Italy, put up the shutters at its detergent carton factory on the outskirts
of Toronto last year at the same time as it started producing the same items
at a new plant in Syracuse, New York. The mining industry, a backbone of
many rural communities, is especially unhappy. American Barrick, the gold
producer whose head office is in Toronto, is not spending a penny on
exploration in Ontario (or any other part of Canada) this year. Citing low
returns on investment and Ontario's recent labour law, Mr Bob Smith,
Barrick's president, asks rhetorically: 'Where the hell would you put your
money?' Barrick is now focusing its efforts on the US, Mexico and Chile.
Ms Martha Hoffman, project manager at the Western New York Economic
Development Corp in Buffalo, estimates that 200-300 Canadian companies have
set up operations in that part of New York state since the mid-1980s.
According to Ms Hoffman, the gap between costs in Ontario and New York is
not as wide as it is often perceived to be. But incentives offered by US
agencies - such as extended property tax concessions and low financing rates
 -are more generous than those available in Canada.
The expectation of wider access to the US market is the clincher for many
companies. 'By being here, they feel they have a better chance of
penetrating it than they do from Canada,' Ms Hoffman says.
Tridon's move to Tennessee is typical of the manufacturers which have headed
south. Mr Murray Kingsburgh, executive vice-president of Devtek, Tridon's
controlling shareholder, says the impetus came from competitors in the
northern US, which were moving to the southern states and Mexico in search
of lower costs, especially labour. 'We knew it had to be done to remain
competitive,' Mr Kingsburgh says. The move was driven entirely by a
comparison of costs. He specifically mentions high wages and taxes in
Ontario. Neither the old nor the new workforces was unionised.
With trade barriers crumbling between the US and Canada, Ontario faces the
challenge of proving to investors that it is the best base for serving not
only Canada's industrial heartland but also a wide swathe of north-east
North America.
Lawson Mardon's new carton plant in Syracuse, for instance, supplies both
the US and Canadian markets. Customers south of the border, such as Procter
&amp; Gamble, Colgate and Unilever, encouraged the company to move as stiffening
competition from US suppliers cut into Lawson's market share.
