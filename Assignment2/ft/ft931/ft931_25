Nymex PLATINUM group metals were down at midday amid nervousness over
President Clinton's state-of-the-union speech, which also kept trading in
Comex GOLD thin. Gold futures were down in early trading on disappointment
at the failure to attract safe-haven buying during the US stock market's
drop. NICKEL prices closed at six-week highs on the LME. Three-month metal
came within a whisker of Dollars 6,300 a tonne. Technical factors continued
to aid the market, as prices built on overnight US merchant buying. London
robusta COFFEE futures finished with trimmed gains. Light origin selling
helped to halt an earlier advance. Dealers said a close above Dollars 945 a
tonne on May would have been technically constructive and might have
triggered some fund buying today, but after peaking at Dollars 954 the rally
stalled. In Chicago WHEAT prices were sharply higher at midday in reaction
to trade talk that Turkey would tender for up to 400,000 tonnes of optional
wheat.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fragile Opec deal leaves
credibility gap - Sticking to quotas will be even harder than agreeing them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH IT proved harder for the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to reach its agreement on second quarter output than most member
countries had expected, the hardest part is still to come: sticking to it.
By the time ministers gathered in Vienna last Saturday, the oil market had
already discounted the main elements of the deal reached late on Tuesday.
Strong signals from Saudi Arabia and Iran during a pre-meeting tour by Mr
Alirio Parra, the Opec president, that they wanted to remove at least 1m b/d
from the cartel's first quarter ceiling of 24.58m b/d had added more than
Dollars 1.5 to the price of a barrel.
Opec will largely succeed in its aim of shoring up prices, therefore, if it
can hold that premium. But this will rely entirely upon member countries
holding hard to their respective allocations and actually delivering a
ceiling of 23.58m b/d from March 1 - thus taking 1.4m b/d off the market,
given Opec's leakage earlier in the year.
Saudi Arabia, the architect of the deal, and Iran both said in Vienna that
they would immediately begin notifying customers of their allocated cuts
under the agreement - statements the cartel's two biggest producers hoped
might add some credibility to the Vienna deal. The kingdom has said it will
cut by 400,000 b/d to 8m b/d, while Iran is to trim to 3.34m b/d from 3.49m
b/d.
Industry analysts attending the meeting were unanimous that the agreement
would offer real support to prices only once it became clear in mid-March if
Opec members were keeping their word. Several suggested that even with some
leakage, perhaps to a real output figure of 23.7m b/d or even 23.8m b/d,
prices might still find support. European traders did not seem impressed
yesterday, however, and nearby prices for Brent crude slipped back below
Dollars 18 a barrel.
The agreement's fragility was signalled clearly by Mr Ali al-Baghli, the
Kuwait oil minister. After having bowed with enormous reluctance and only
after four days of stern pressure from Saudi Arabia and Iran to cut Kuwaiti
production to 1.6m b/d for the second quarter, he said: 'I'm going to watch
this market; and any additional barrel or two and I am at liberty'. If there
was any cheating elsewhere, he said, Kuwait would immediately pump to what
it claims will be a 2.1m b/d capacity in the second quarter.
The tough wrangling that finally brought Kuwait back within a regime of Opec
allocations for the first time since the Gulf war revealed a more serious
flaw in the latest agreement, however.
Kuwait agreed to its cut only on condition that at the next Opec meeting in
June it will be accorded a third quarter ceiling 'in parity with the
production allocation to other countries with similar production capacity,
historical market share and quota'. It took eight hours of negotiation for
Opec members to agree this wording on Tuesday and thus enable a
deal-finalising communique. But it became apparent soon after the
communique's release that there was no real agreement on what it meant.
Mr al-Baghli said immediately after the meeting that this represented an
'explicit agreement' that Kuwait would be awarded parity with the United
Arab Emirates when allocations for the third quarter are decided at Opec's
next meeting in June. Kuwait and the UAE were both awarded quotas of 1.5m
b/d under Opec's last formal quota system, agreed in July 1990, just before
the Gulf war. Before the war both countries had roughly similar production
capacity of around 2.5m b/d. Under the present deal the UAE will pump 2.1m
b/d.
Kuwait was determined above all at the latest meeting that it should
re-establish its claim to its pre-Gulf war share of Opec output, even though
its oil industry had not yet physically reached the point where it could
sustain pre-war capacity. Mr al-Baghli said on Tuesday that he considered
that battle won.
Minutes after Mr al-Baghli spoke, however, his Iranian counterpart, Mr
Gholamreza Aghazadeh said that the communique gave absolutely no guarantee
that Kuwait would be given any sort of parity when ministers met again in
June, with the UAE or anyone else. 'Maybe that's Kuwait's perception,' he
said curtly.
Iran opposed any mention of parity or any overt reference to Kuwait's
special post-war circumstances largely because it already had its eyes on
Iraq's eventual return to the oil market. Before the Gulf war, and under a
hard-bargained Opec compromise between the two big Gulf neighbours reached
during the Iran-Iraq war, both countries were awarded exact parity at a
quota of 3.14m b/d. Above all things, Iran now wants there to be no
precedent set that might tie them back into parity with Iraq.
Iran says it has already spent Dollars 3.5bn on raising output capacity
towards a target of 4.5m b/d by March and hopes to go on to achieve an
eventual sustainable capacity of 6m b/d. Whenever Iraq returns to the
market, once the UN agrees that it has met all the terms of the Gulf war
ceasefire and sanctions are lifted, it will do so with considerably lower
output capacity than Iran - even given that most industry estimates say
Tehran's claims for present capacity are inflated.
Iraq is certain to latch firmly on to any precedent Opec has set for Kuwait
during its post-war reconstruction and Iran fears this means it will seek to
achieve agreement that it should once again be tied into an equivalent quota
to its neighbour. Indeed, Iraq said firmly after the latest deal that it
regarded the July 1990 quota system, with its entrenched parity between Iran
and Iraq, as the sole benchmark for Opec allocations.
However successful Opec is, therefore, in achieving its target for the
second quarter, its members have already drawn the battle lines for a far
tougher fight in June over market share. Iraq's return to the market is
still somewhat distant - indeed Saudi Arabia is confident that the country
will never re-enter the market fully while Saddam Hussein remains in power.
But the arguments to accommodate Iraq have begun and are likely to detain
Opec delegates for much longer than four days when they next meet in June.

FT  18 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although Australian wool prices have become a little dearer this week, with
the Wool Corporation's market indicator reaching 470 cents a kg. yesterday
compared with 457 a week earlier, there are still very heavy withdrawals by
farmers to take into account. Withdrawals at reserves during the sale
amounted to about 15%, but in addition 10% to 25% was withdrawn at the three
selling centres prior to the start of the sale. Thus anything from 25% to
40% of the originally scheduled offering was not sold. China is listed as
the main buyer.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China invites explorers to
prime oil areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER YEARS of procrastination China yesterday invited foreign oil companies
to explore in promising onshore areas, including the vast Tarim basin in the
country's remote north-west.
Mr Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corporation, said
yesterday that exploration bids for five blocs covering 72,730 square km
(28,000 square miles) in the south-eastern sector of the Tarim basin would
be called in March. There would be a second round of bidding for additional
acreage by early next year, he said.
Worries about flagging domestic production - China may become a net importer
by 1995 - and the need to speed exploration in remote areas apparently
dispelled lingering reservations about opening up territory to foreign
explorers. The booming economy - GNP growth reached 12 per cent last year -
is putting added strain on dwindling oil reserves.
Oil company representatives welcomed China's decision to open its 'wild
west' to exploration - Shell and BP in particular expressed strong interest
 -but they indicated caution about commiting resources to such a remote
region. Transporting oil to the coast would require a 2,000 km pipeline
across some of the world's roughest terrain. Many offshore explorers had
their fingers badly burnt in China in the 1980s. A representative of
Australia's BHP Petroleum noted ruefully yesterday that the company had
drilled 23 dry wells in the Yellow Sea and the Pearl River Delta.
China had previously allowed foreign participation in onshore exploration,
but restricted this to relatively unpromising areas in 11 southern
provinces. The extension of foreign exploration leases to northern and
western regions is certain to excite considerable explorers'interest.
Based on fairly sketchy seismic data, China claims that the Tarim basin
contains massive reserves of perhaps more than 100bn barrels. Even if only a
fraction of such deposits are recoverable at reasonable cost the region
would become one of the world biggest oilfields.
Mr Wang Tao also announced the opening of existing oilfields to foreign
participation. China's 'mature' fields face increasing difficulties
maintaining production without sophisticated enhancement techniques. China
at present produces about 2.8m barrels a day and its exports are hovering
around 400,000 b/d. The country ranks sixth in the world in oil production.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Short-dated gilts fall as retail data wipe
out rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED UK govern-ment bonds fell as news of better-than-expected retail
sales figures wiped out hopes of a cut in the base rate before the March 16
budget.
Meanwhile, longer-dated issues edged higher on domestic buying interest,
resulting in a further flattening of the yield curve.
Retail sales climbed 1.6 per cent in January from December, showing the
strongest increase in more than 18 months and a sharp turnround after the
revised 1 per cent fall in sales during December.
Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, warned that there were no plans to adjust
interest rates.
The 10 per cent gilt due 1994 fell from 105 15/32 to 105 3/8 by late
afternoon to yield 5.75 per cent.
GERMAN government bonds closed higher, with investors encouraged to buy
bunds because of the strength of the D-Mark against the dollar.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 93.70 and traded up to a high of
93.88 before ending the day at around 93.85. Dealers said hopes of a
relatively good M3 figure and yesterday's repo gave the market a firm tone.
The Bundesbank accepted bids amounting to DM70.7bn in 14-day securities
repurchase agreements, representing a net injection of DM2.4bn in liquidity.
The repos were allocated at 8.49 per cent and above, compared with 8.50 per
cent and above at the previous repo.
Elsewhere in Europe, French government bond prices closed firmer, taking
their cue from the bund market. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due
2003 moved from 7.84 per cent to 7.76 per cent.
Among short-dated issues, the rally was less pronounced as the market
expects the Treasury to sell FFr17bn-FFr19bn of two and five-year bonds
today.
JAPANESE government bonds continued to rally, helped by the combination of a
strong yen, initial stock market weakness, and good investor demand for
nine-year and 10-year paper.
The June futures contract, which opened at 109.88, rose to a new high of
110.02 before ending at 109.90. The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB moved
from 4.17 per cent to 4.14 per cent, corresponding to the high price of the
day, but ended at 4.165 per cent.
US Treasury prices firmed across the maturity range yesterday as investors
bet that President Clinton would announce a credible package of
deficit-cutting measures in his State of the Union address to Congress,
which was scheduled for last night.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 100
9/32 , yielding 7.097 per cent, a new historical low. At the short end of
the market, the two-year note was up  1/8 at 100 13/32 , to yield 4.014 per
cent.
Prices initially firmed in the expectation that further losses in equities
would drive investors into government securities. The absence of another big
sell-off in the stock markets, however, kept those gains to a minimum.
Sentiment was also buoyed by the day's main economic news  - a 7.2 per cent
decline in January housing starts.
In the afternoon, Treasuries rose further on hopes that the president would
announce he will stick to his plans to raise taxes and cut spending as a way
of reducing the deficit. In particular, bond investors were looking for him
to unveil measures that would have a serious chance of passing through the
House and Senate.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Argyll turns to sterling
bonds to raise Pounds 150m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGYLL, the supermarket group, yesterday became the latest UK company to
raise fixed-rate finance through a sterling bond issue, a further sign that
UK finance directors believe long-term sterling interest rates are unlikely
to fall much further from their current levels.
The group raised Pounds 150m through an issue of seven-year Eurobonds to
meet part of the Pounds 600m cost of its store development programme this
year.
The bonds, with an 8 1/8 per cent coupon, were priced to yield 8.1 per cent,
or 80 basis points more than the 9 per cent gilt due in 2000.
Falling UK interest rates, and a move by many companies to shift their
borrowing to shorter-dated instruments, has left the Eurosterling market
starved of longer-dated paper, with demand reported in particular for bonds
of seven years or longer. As a result, yield spreads between corporate and
government debt have narrowed steadily in recent months.
Other issues recently have been concentrated in the long-dated domestic
debenture market, with Forte, the hotels group, last week raising Pounds
200m, the largest issue of secured bonds for 18 months.
Mr Colin Smith, finance director of Argyll, said the money raised yesterday
has not been swapped into a floating-rate liability, since the company is
matching the coupon payments to the expected cashflows from store
developments.
Although unrated, Argyll was said by bankers involved in the transaction to
be seen by investors as a similar credit to rival supermarket group Tesco,
which carries a AA3 rating. A Tesco Eurobond issue maturing in 2002 was
yesterday yielding around 70 basis points over gilts. Argyll's bonds firmed
in later trading yesterday, with the spread over gilts narrowing to 76 basis
points.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P asked to withdraw rating
for Dai-Ichi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAI-ICHI Mutual Life Insurance Company has taken the unusual step of
requesting Standard &amp; Poor's to withdraw its credit rating, after the US
agency lowered the company's rating on claims paying ability from triple-A
to double-A+, S&amp;P said, writes Tracy Corrigan.
'In the light of the withdrawal, S&amp;P will no longer be able to maintain
surveillance of this insurer's financial strength at a time of growing
uncertainty surrounding Japanese financial institutions,' the agency said.
The downgrade was prompted by the earnings and capital deterioration caused
by the economic downturn in Japan. S&amp;P said that the sharp decline in the
Japanese stock market had greatly reduced unrealised gains in Dai-Ichi's
equities portfolio.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Quebec and World Bank join high-quality
issuers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international bond market had an active day as several high-quality
borrowers launched deals in a variety of currencies.
Among the previously-announced global deals, the Canadian Province of
Quebec's CDollars 1.4bn offering due 2023 was priced yesterday to yield 90
basis points over comparable Canadian government bonds, and kept to that
spread when they were freed to trade in the afternoon.
Syndicate managers said that a significant proportion of Quebec's bonds were
placed in the US and Canada but that there had also been demand from
Switzerland, Germany and Japan.
The day's other global issue, the World Bank's Y200bn due 2003, is due to be
priced early today to yield 25-27 basis points above the benchmark Japanese
government bond No 145 due 2002, the same as the yield of the World Bank's
first global yen deal which also matures in 2002.
An official at IBJ International, the joint lead manager and book-runner of
the deal along with Morgan Stanley and Nikko Europe, said he expected the
issue to be priced towards the tighter end of the indicated range, in view
of the level of demand so far.
The official added that between 40 to 50 per cent of the issue was likely to
be placed in the Far East, about 30 per cent in Europe and the remainder in
the US.
The good reception to these two global deals raised hopes that the Kingdom
of Sweden's first global offering in dollars would proceed smoothly. The
terms of the deal are expected in the next few days.
Elsewhere, the European Investment Bank fulfilled market expectations by
launching a Ecu500m seven-year bond. The bonds were priced at 98.41 to yield
8.056 per cent, the same yield as the French government's 9 1/2 per cent
Ecu-denominated OATs due 2000.
The pricing represents a yield spread of 18 basis points above the
theoretical Ecu yield curve, which is based on the value of bonds
denominated in component currencies. The differential between theoretical
and real yields is widest at seven years. For example, the yield spread in
the three-year area is virtually flat, in five years it is 10 basis points,
and in the 10-year area, three basis points.
Syndicate managers said the fact that the EIB's bonds were pitched at the
cheapest part of the curve from the investors' viewpoint indicated that
there was political pressure on the supranational agency to continue to
restore investor confidence in the Ecu-denominated sector of the Eurobond
market.
'It is in the EIB's interest that the deal goes well,' said one syndicate
manager.
When the bonds were freed to trade, they quickly rose to 98.65 bid, giving a
yield of three basis points below that of the OATs.
In the D-Mark sector, the Spanish region of Andalucia reaped the benefits of
a successful presentation to investors in Frankfurt last week, which enabled
it to raise the amount of its previously-announced five-year offering from
DM300m to DM400m, its maximum requirement.
'The deal was well pre-placed,' said an official at the lead manager
Dresdner Bank. He added that the bonds had been evenly distributed in
Germany and Switzerland. When the syndicate broke, the bonds rose as high as
101 from a re-offer price of par, but eased back to 100.70 bid in the late
afternoon.
Compared with other sectors of the market, the D-Mark sector has been
relatively neglected in recent weeks, but syndicate managers expect some
sovereign and supranational issuers to tap this area in the near future.
Belgium is reported to be considering a DM600m offering, while the European
Community may raise more than DM1bn.
Meanwhile, continued good conditions in the swaps market prompted the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Kingdom of
Denmark to raise Canadian dollars for the second time in less than a month.
Yesterday, both borrowers raised CDollars 250m each via five-year offerings.
When the syndicate broke on the EBRD deal, the bonds traded at their launch
spread of 26 basis points above comparable Canadian government bonds.
Denmark's deal was launched later in the day, at a yield spread of 44 basis
points above comparable Canadian government bonds, and the bonds were not
freed to trade by late yesterday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANON, the office equipment and camera manufacturer, last year suffered a
small decline in sales but posted a marginal increase in profits due mainly
to the strength of its computer peripherals business.
Pre-tax profits moved up 1.3 per cent to Y77.13bn (Dollars 637m) as turnover
dipped by 0.9 per cent to Y1,063bn.
Canon expects a modest improvement in both sales and profits this year on
the back of a second-half recovery. It forecasts anincrease in sales to
Y1,100bn and a rise in pre-tax profits to Y77.5bn.
The company, chaired by Mr Ryuzaburo Kaku, which is considering buying the
computer hardware operations of Next Computer, the US company, saw sales in
its computer peripherals business rise 25 per cent to Y405.45bn in 1992.
In the computer peripherals division, the company's laser printers sold
particularly well in the second half after it introduced a new model, while
its bubble jet printers increased sales last year as awareness of their
advantages spread.
Copiers also performed well. Sales increased by 4 per cent to Y332.9bn,
largely on the strength of colour copiers, application equipment such as
feeders and chemicals such as toners.
But cameras suffered a 24 per cent fall in sales to Y167.29bn, as the
economic slump dampened consumer spending. Cameras, which were Canon's
mainstay in its early years, accounted last year for only 16 per cent of
sales, against 21 per cent in 1991. Sales of communication equipment also
fell back 12 per cent, to Y114.42bn, but this was largely a result of a
transfer of the company's personal communications equipment business to a
new company it set up last year in Hong Kong.

ADollars 31.8m (USDollars 21.6m) on its development properties after

The write-off reduced net profits for the six months ended December to
ADollars 3.51m, from ADollars 10.51m, off-setting more than doubled
operating earnings of ADollars 36.1m.

<TEXT>
AECI. the South African chemicals group in which ICI of the UK and
Anglo-American Industrial have large share stakes, reports lower profits for
1992 but plans to maintain its dividend.
Earnings per share fell to 106 cents from 121 cents and compare with the 203
cents achieved in 1989. The dividend is being held at 58 cents.
Mr Mike Sander, managing director, said 1992 had been a worse year than
originally predicted for two reasons: the lack of growth in world economies
and the very severe drought in South Africa.
Exports make up a significant portion of AECI's business. About 20 per cent
of its turnover goes directly to the agriculture sector.
Turnover for the year rose by 1 per cent to R5.36bn (Dollars 1.7bn) and net
trading income was unchanged at R403m. Cost controls saw margins maintained
in most sectors, though at low levels. A slightly higher tax bill and a
decline to R16m from R28m in investment income saw attributable income drop
to R164m from R187m.
Exports rose by 28 per cent to R643m (R502m), accounting for 12 per cent of
turnover.

THAINOX Steel, the Thai stainless steel joint venture in which Ugine of
France is the largest foreign shareholder, yesterday announced that a
consortium of six Japanese companies had been brought into the project.
ILVA of Italy was brought into the venture last year.
The latest move is the final stage in a restructuring of Thainox's equity,
which began when several international steel producers found themselves
planning rival factories with a combined capacity far too large for the Thai
market.
Under the final arrangement, Ugine will have 21 per cent of Thainox while
ILVA and the Japanese consortium will hold 14 per cent each. The four Thai
partners will share the remaining 51 per cent. Ugine and its partner, PM
Group of Thailand, will retain joint management and operational control.
Nippon Steel will co-ordinate the Japanese consortium, which says it will
have the right to supply 30 per cent of the raw material for the plant in
Rayong and to sell 30 per cent of Thainox's output to the Japanese
companies' traditional customers in Thailand.
The factory is due to start production in October this year of up to 60,000
tonnes a year of cold-rolled stainless steel sheets, an amount slightly
higher than the present size of the entire Thai market.
The sheets are used to make a range of products, including washing machines
and car exhaust systems.
Thainox says its plant will be the first producing stainless steel in the
six-country Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), where demand is
growing at more than 10 per cent a year.
The other Japanese participants are Nisshin Steel, Kawasaki Steel, Sumitomo
Metal Industries, Nippon Metal Industry and Nippon Yakin Kogyo.

<TEXT>
BURNS Philp, the Australian food and hardware group, yesterday announced a
32 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 54.5m (USDollars 37m) for the
six months ended December, on sales up 17 per cent to ADollars 1.35bn.
The group said its North American consumer foods and European yeast
operations performed 'particularly strongly'. The recently-acquired
Durkee-French spice business in the US also made a 'significant'
contribution.
Mr Andrew Turnbull, managing director, said the group was 'pretty happy'
with the result. He forecast an improvement on last year's full-year net
earnings of ADollars 101m.
The board raised the dividend from 8 cents to 8.5 cents, helping to maintain
the shares at a peak ADollars 4.08 on the Australian Stock Exchange, despite
a weak market.
Burns Philp said that two thirds of pre-tax profits were contributed by the
food operations in North and South America, which reported a 66 per cent
improvement in operating earnings to ADollars 65.9m.
Most of the improvement was contributed by Durkee-French, purchased last
year for ADollars 113m, which recorded pre-tax profits of ADollars 18.4m.
The group said the division also gained from improved productivity and
higher returns from its Argentine operations.
The food ingredients businesses in the Asia/Pacific region, which includes
Australia, raised operating earnings by 25 per cent to ADollars 20.9m,
largely as a result of the benefits of rationalisation.
However, Burns Philp said pre-tax returns from its BBC Hardware division
fell by 11 per cent to ADollars 17.9m, mainly because of high unemployment
and low consumer confidence in Australia.

to full-year profit

<TEXT>
FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand forest products and energy group,
expects to return to profit this year following strong first-half gains.
The company forecasts profits of NZDollars 200m (USDollars 103m) for the
year ending June, 1993 on the back of positive factors in most of its
operations. For 1991-1992 the group made a loss of NZDollars 158m after
writing down its Australian property portfolio.
As reported in late editions yesterday, the six months ended December
achieved earnings of NZDollars 153.5m excluding abnormal items, up from
NZDollars 121m a year ago.
Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, said the result reflected good
performance in energy, both in New Zealand and Canada, a strong recovery in
its New Zealand operations, an improving trend in Canada, and continued
growth in sales to Asia, which reached NZDollars 1bn for the first time.
The group had also achieved a significant reduction in its interest expenses
and improved the cash flows from existing businesses.
Mr Fletcher pledged that the company, which was widely criticised in 1991
and 1992 for continuing to expand rather than repay debt, would not make any
further acquisitions until it had improved its international investment
grade ratings. He said a number of further assets were to be sold, including
nearly all its investment properties in New Zealand.
Discussing the future, Mr Fletcher said the company saw 'reasonable ' growth
prospects in New Zealand, North America and Asia, excluding Japan. 'We
expect conditions in Britain and Australia to be difficult, but to show
continuing improvement,' he said.
Mr Fletcher said an aggressive restructuring programme was under way with
the company concentrating on expanding output, reducing employees and
developing new products to increase profitability. He said that despite
these improvements a recovery in prices is necessary to restore
profitability.
He said the immediate outlook was that with the exception of methanol and
wood pulp, most of the company's products and services appeared to have
reached the bottom of their cyclical trough, and had begun an upward
movement.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Thai Stock Exchange seeks
improved disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange of Thailand yesterday announced plans to improve
financial disclosure by listed companies after the shutdown of First City
Investment, a small listed finance and securities company.
FCI suspended payment of mature promissory notes this week and the Bank of
Thailand, the central bank, said the company was 'temporarily closed'
because of liquidity problems pending further efforts to arrange a rescue.
FCI is thought to have several billion baht of bad and doubtful debts on its
books. The BoT said an investigation last year showed that FCI had extended
loans to affiliated companies without collateral.
Bangkok Bank, the country's largest commercial bank, has been asked by the
BoT to rescue FCI in exchange for broking licences and other incentives, but
a deal has yet to be completed.
Mr Seri Chintanaseri, SET president, said after an SET board meeting
yesterday that companies suspected of providing misleading financial
information would be reported to the newly-formed Securities and Exchange
Commission.

Dollars 300m write-off

   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPBELL SOUP, the US foods group, yesterday disclosed a second-quarter net
loss of Dollars 115.9m, or 46 cents a share. The deficit was caused by an
anticipated Dollars 300m write-off taken in connection with a restructuring
and divestiture programme that included plant closures. Last year Campbell
achieved second-quarter net profits of Dollars 160.6m or 64 cents.
The New Jersey-based company said sales reached record levels in the
quarter, having risen by 2 per cent year-on-year to Dollars 1.79bn.
Six-month sales rose 6 per cent to Dollars 3.48bn, while first-half net
earnings were Dollars 40.7m, or 16 cents a share, down from Dollars 289.8m,
or Dollars 1.15 last time.
Mr David Johnson, president and chief executive of Campbell, said that
before restructuring charges the company's net earnings were actually 18 per
cent higher in the first six months.
'In the teeth of a tough competitive environment worldwide, we have
delivered strong results for the second quarter,' Mr Johnson said.
Campbell's North and South American division, the single largest business,
reported a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter operating earnings before
restructuring charges. Sales for the division were 4 per cent better at
Dollars 1.29bn.
The biscuit and bakery division had a 2 per cent decrease in operating
earnings before charges with sales 1 per cent lower at Dollars 214.2m in the
quarter.
Operating earnings in the second quarter for Campbell Europe/Asia increased
by 10 per cent before restructuring charges. Sales were 1 per cent lower at
Dollars 290.2m.

TELEGLOBE, Canada's fast-expanding international telecommunications group,
earned CDollars 18m (USDollars 14m) or 34 cents a share in the final quarter
of 1992, up 50 per cent from CDollars 12m or 26 cents a share a year
earlier, on a revenue gain of 11 per cent to CDollars 143m.
The gains came from rising telecommunications volume and lower financial
charges.
Operating profits for 1992 came to CDollars 30.6m or 72 cents a share up
from CDollars 25.7m or 54 cents a share the year before, on revenues of
CDollars 489m, up 12 per cent.
But net restructuring charges of CDollars 81m brought attributable losses
for the year of CDollars 50.6m or CDollars 1.19 a share.
Newbridge Networks, a Canadian-based international telecommunications
equipment producer, earned CDollars 34.5m or 96 cents a share in the nine
months ended January 31, up from CDollars 5.1m or 15 cents a share a year
earlier. Revenues were CDollars 207m, up from CDollars 129m, because of
major contract deliveries.
SHL Systemhouse, a big Canadian systems integrator, plans expansion in
Mexico and other Latin American countries, besides the US and Europe.
Norcen, an international energy group controlled by Edper-Hees, reports net

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Increased sales help push EdF to
FFr2.5bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ELECTRICITE de France (EdF), the state-controlled utility group, achieved a
32 per cent increase in net profits to FFr2.5bn (Dollars 452.3m) in 1992,
from FFr1.9bn in 1991.
Mr Gilles Menage, chairman, said the rise was due to increased sales of
electricity (both in France and other countries), to lower primary prices
and to debt reduction.
EdF, which has made significant productivity improvements in recent years,
promised earlier this month to start cutting its prices in France by 1.25
per cent a year.
Sales rose to FFr177.5bn last year from FFr171.4bn in 1991 while gross
operating profits climbed to FFr77. from FFr71.5bn.
In France, which accounts for 86 per cent of turnover, sales grew by 3.6 per
cent to FFr159.7bn last year, in spite of despite the unusually mild
climate.
International sales rose by 3 per cent to FFr12bn.
Although EdF suffered a reduction in demand in some markets, such as
Germany, it managed to compensated through price increases.
The group plans to continue its international expansion outside France but
has opted to do so through joint ventures, notably in Spain and eastern
Germany rather than by selling electricity directly as it does in its UK
operation.
Mr Menage said that EdF, which will have to invest heavily at the start of
the next century to renew its nuclear power plants, had held investment
expenditure at FFr32.4bn in 1992, compared with FFr32.3bn in 1991.
This helped it to reduce debt to FFr194.8bn last year from FFr214bn in 1991.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Third-best results for
Desjardins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS

<TEXT>
CANADA'S biggest co-operative financial institution, the Quebec-based
Mouvement des Caisses Desjardins, says 1992 proved its third best year
despite the recession, higher loan loss provisions and commercial property
problems at its affiliated trust company.
Desjardins operates nearly 1,500 retail banking branches in Quebec, Ontario,
Manitoba and New Brunswick, life and general insurance units and a wholesale
banking operation.
Overall, 1992 profit was CDollars 286m (USDollars 228m), up 18 per cent from
1991. Assets rose 9 per cent to CDollars 56bn, well ahead of its Quebec
rival, National Bank of Canada.
The core Quebec retail banking business generated most of the profit, with
good gains in personal and mortgage lending and in deposits.
The trust company's loss was CDollars 22.2m, up from CDollars 16.6m in 1991,
because of larger provisions to cover third property loans for the second
year running. It has dropped its dividend and wants to convert CDollars 25m
of debentures into shares.
Desjardins trimmed its workforce by 1,400 to 36,000 last year. It warned of
further rationalisation by shutting down a loss-making Montreal branch hit
by an eight-month strike in 1992.

HEWLETT-PACKARD, the US computer and electronics manufacturer, reported
higher than expected first-quarter earnings. The quarter, ended in January,
is the first since Mr Lewis Platt succeeded Mr John Young as president and
chief executive in October, when Mr Young retired.
Net earnings were Dollars 261m, or Dollars 1.03 per share, compared with a
net loss of Dollars 30m or 12 cents per share in the first fiscal quarter of
1992, when HP took an after tax charge of Dollars 332m to reflect a change
in accounting for retiree health care benefits.
Excluding the charge, HP had net earnings of Dollars 302m or Dollars 1.19
per share in the first quarter a year ago.
Wall Street analysts had been predicting net earnings of around 96 cents per
share. HP's stock jumped sharply yesterday, closing Dollars 4 5/8 up on the
day at Dollars 72 1/4 .
Revenue for the quarter totalled Dollars 4.6bn, compared with Dollars 3.9bn
in the same period last year. US revenues were Dollars 2.1bn, up 24 per
cent, while revenues from outside the US rose 14 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn.
The company noted that acquisitions accounted for about three percentage
points of the growth in revenues.
New orders booked during the quarter were a record Dollars 5.2bn, up 24 per
cent, signaling strong revenues in the future. US orders totalled Dollars
2.1bn, up 18 per cent over 1992, while orders from outside the US grew by 28
per cent to Dollars 3.1bn.
'We're extremely pleased with our growth in orders, which was well balanced
by business and geography,' said Mr Platt. 'Our revenue growth was strong
and earnings were good, even though they were lower than those of our
outstanding first quarter of 1992.
'The year is off to a good start,' he added. 'Our challenge is to turn
strong order growth into higher profitability. We're cautious, however,
because continuing order growth depends in part on worldwide economic
conditions, which still show signs of weakness in key geographies.
'We're encouraged by the success of our new products, and we're finding
opportunities even in this tough environment. Our focus will remain on the
strong product programmes and lean organisations that success requires.'
Operating expenses for the first quarter rose 11 per cent , with about 2
percentage points of this increase due to the effects of acquisitions.
Operating expenses fell as a percentage of net revenue from 34.7 per cent in
1992's first quarter to 32.5 per cent.
'We're very pleased with the progress we've made on reducing operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenues,' said Mr Platt. 'We must continue
our efforts to reduce operating expense ratios in all our businesses.'
Separately, HP announced that Mr John O'Rourke, formerly of Bellcore and
Bell Labs where he had more than 25 years' experience directing
telecommunications programs, has joined the company in the newly created
position of general manager, Telecommunications Operations, and chief
telecommunications architect.
In this post, Mr O'Rourke will lead development of an integrated strategy to
increase significantly HP's position in the telecommunications industry, the
company said.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: TWA presents plan to emerge from
bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS World Airlines (TWA), the bankrupt and debt-laden US carrier,
yesterday presented its long-awaited reorganisation plan, in which it
informed a Delaware court it hoped to emerge from bankruptcy this spring.
The plan - presented jointly by the airline and the official unsecured
creditors' committee - provides for the elimination of about Dollars 4bn in
total claims against TWA. It also calls for the distribution of new TWA
common and preferred stock to the airline's creditors and employees and the
issuance of new debt securities.
Under the plan TWA's creditors would receive cash and new debt and equity
securities. TWA employees would end up owning 45 per cent of the common
stock of the reorganised airline; the employees have agreed about Dollars
660m of wage and benefit cuts over a three-year period.
The remaining 55 per cent of common stock, as well as 100 per cent of
preferred stock and new debt securities, would be distributed to various
unsecured creditors.
Mr Glenn Zander and Mr Robin Wilson, TWA's co-chief executives, said the new
plan set the stage for the airline to emerge from bankruptcy ahead of the
peak summer travel season. They claimed it established the framework of a
sound debt and capital structure under which TWA could return to
profitability.
Mr Charles MacDonald, chairman of the creditors' committee, called the plan
'a watershed event' and said that while negotiations would continue the
filing of the plan meant the major elements had now won general acceptance.
The next step is expected to be a court hearing on TWA's statement, to be
held soon. The plan cannot become effective without further bankruptcy court
proceedings and acceptance by TWA creditors.
The plan's strategy includes shrinking TWA operations to eliminate
unprofitable routes and reconfiguring the aircraft fleet; using a lower cost
structure based on renegotiated aircraft leases and cutting wages and
benefits by 15 per cent.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: HK investors buy into Westcoast
Petroleum
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE wealthy Hong Kong investors are taking a substantial stake in western
Canada's oil and gas industry by buying Westcoast Petroleum, a subsidiary of
Westcoast Energy of Vancouver.
The Hong Kong consortium will pay CDollars 247.5m (USDollars 196.4m) for
Westcoast, which has been seeking extra capital for some time to finance
exploration programmes in western Canada, as well as Libya and Indonesia.
The buying group is led by Mr Cheng Yu-Tung, chairman of New World
Development, Mr Stanley Ho who heads Shun Tak Holdings, and Mr Lee Shau Kee,
chairman of Henderson Land Development.
Canada has been one of the main beneficiaries of the flight of capital from
Hong Kong ahead of the colony's 1997 handover to China.
The Westcoast purchasers are following in the footsteps of Mr Li Ka-shing,
who controls Husky Oil, one of Canada's biggest independent oil and gas
producers.
Husky has incurred sizeable losses in recent years however, and has been a
heavy burden on Mr Li's Hong Kong companies.
Mr Stephen Letwin, Westcoast's chief financial officer, noted yesterday that
his company was smaller than Husky and more focused on upstream exploration
and production. 'We think these investors are going to be more than pleased
with what they get,' Mr Letwin said.
Westcoast, which is based in Calgary and classified as a mid-sized producer,
suffered a CDollars 5.7m loss in the first nine months of 1992 on operating
revenues of CDollars 82m.
The setback was due largely to lower natural gas prices, which have staged a
recovery in recent months. Westcoast Energy was due to release its annual
financial results late yesterday.
Westcoast Petroleum produced an average of 14,400 barrels of oil and 76m cu
ft of gas a day last year.
Westcoast Energy is selling the oil and gas division to concentrate on
natural gas distribution following its CDollars 600m purchase last year of
Union Energy, an Ontario gas company.
Proceeds from the disposal will be used to reduce borrowings used to finance
the Union acquisition. Westcoast is also planning an equity issue.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cigna falls sharply in final
term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIGNA, one of the largest composite insurance companies in the US, has
announced a sharp drop in fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 50m, down from
Dollars 108m a year earlier.
Full-year 1992 profits of Dollars 311m were also well down on the previous
year, when the company earned Dollars 449m, although the latest results were
depressed by a Dollars 26m charge to cover the adoption of new accounting
standards.
Earnings would have been worse but for realised investment gains, which
brought in Dollars 19m in the fourth quarter and Dollars 192m in the year.
In comparison, investment gains in 1991 netted only Dollars 52m.
The company, which described its results as 'unsatisfactory', said its
property and casualty operations incurred a loss of Dollars 374m last year,
despite investment gains of Dollars 111m.
The bulk of the losses were due to a big increase in catastrophe losses,
which jumped from Dollars 68m in 1991 to Dollars 251m, largely as a result
of Hurricane Andrew which devastated parts of southern Florida and Louisiana
in August.
Earnings from Cigna's employee life and health benefits business also fell
sharply in 1992, although income from its financial services division rose
slightly.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Aker foresees job cuts in face
of steep North Sea output fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AKER, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, is gearing up for
a large-scale restructuring of its oil and gas division, because it is faced
with a steep fall in North Sea oil and gas activity, expected by 1995.
Mr Tore Bergersen, president of the division, said that to adapt to future
market conditions, a significant down-sizing operation might be necessary,
with the possibility of up to 3,000 to 4,000 engineering and fabrication
jobs being shed within the division, which currently has 11,000 employees.
In 1991 the division achieved turnover of NKr7.9bn (Dollars 1.1bn), but by
the first eight months of last year turnover had already reached NKr7.5bn.
Aker is due to report 1992 results on March 4.
The group's oil and gas technology division supplies engineering, equipment
and fabrication work to the oil and gas industry. It comprises nine
sub-divisions and has a current order book valued at NKr26bn.
Norwegian Contractors, a core sub-division, will see turnover of NKr3.3bn in
1993, Mr Bergersen forecast. The figure is slightly lower than what is
expected for 1992, but up from NKr2.3bn in 1991.
The division will also have to adapt to more compact development projects,
by building much smaller scale oil and gas platforms, so that existing North
Sea oil and gas infrastructure can be utilised after production from these
massive installations winds down, Mr Bergersen said.
Another way the division will adapt to leaner times is by entering
'partnering' projects, an industry term describing projects which extend
over several years to provide oil companies with a wide-range of
maintenance, engineering and fabrication projects, mostly for existing
platforms.
Mr Bergersen said the division recently entered a partnering relationship
with British Petroleum Norway which will endure for an unlimited time or as
stipulated by BP.
Another way in which Aker's oil and gas technology division will adapt is by
taking on international projects.
The first step was taken two years ago through the acquisition of Gulf
Fabricators in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Houston-based Omega Marine.
Aker believes it will benefit greatly in future from earlier relationships
established with major international oil companies for which it has already
engineered and built numerous platforms in the North Sea. As the majors
expand oil and gas production worldwide, they will need the services which
Aker can provide, particularly for high-technology deep water oil and gas
projects.
Aker also believes Norwegian oil companies Statoil, Saga Petroleum and Norsk
Hydro will demand its services as they develop oil and gas reserves which
they are hoping to discover in offshore regions such as south-east Asia and
West Africa.

<TEXT>
BELLSOUTH, the largest of the Baby Bell regional telephone companies that
was spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984, has unveiled plans to spend up to Dollars
9bn during the next three years updating its telecommunications network.
The Atlanta-based company said Dollars 5.7bn would be spent to keep up with
the business' growth and to replace outdated equipment, and another Dollars
3bn would be invested in newer technology for the network infrastructure.
Some of the money will go towards the installation of more fibre optic cable
and the continued replacement of analog central offices with digital
equipment.
So far, BellSouth has installed 900,000 miles of fibre optic cable in its US
network and plans to install fibre-to-the-curb systems for 130,000
residential and business customers over the next three years. The
incorporation of self-healing capabilities into the network to enhance
reliability will also continue under the capital investment programme.
In a separate development, BellSouth has signed preliminary agreements with
Intel, RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson Telephone to develop new products and
services for the mobile computing market.
The four companies said they planned to expand the availability and increase
the usage of standard Intel processor-based mobile computers able to perform
two-way wireless communications via the nationwide dedicated public mobile
data networks run by RAM.
BellSouth and Intel also said they would be exploring new mobile computing
products and services that can be used on a variety of communications
networks.

with its larger rival

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AEROMEXICO and Mexicana, Mexico's two main airlines, have agreed to a share
swap deal giving Aeromexico control over its larger rival. The move will
allow them to restrict competition on some routes and share reservation
systems.
Under the alliance the companies' shareholders will swap shares in each
other's businesses. The more efficient Aeromexico will gain the controlling
interest in a new holding company which will run both airlines. However,
Mexicana and Aeromexico will survive as separate entities, in name at least.
Despite rapid growth in Mexican air travel, both Mexicana and Aeromexico
have been losing money. Mexicana, whose principal shareholders include Sir
James Goldsmith, incurred net losses of 223,892m pesos in the first nine
months of last year. The company owns 11 airbuses, 20 Boeing 727-200, and
six DC-10's. The agreement marks a triumph for Aeromexico, which has just
bought a controling interest in AeroPeru, and is looking to expand
internationally.
THe agreement appears to have received the green light from the Mexican
government, and raises questions about official commitment to competition
policy. Many sectors of the Mexican economy are dominated by
quasi-monopolies, including television, telecommunications, and now
airlines.
United Airlines, the US airline controlled by UAL, is offering for sale its
17 flight kitchens located throughout the US and has engaged First Boston to
serve as its financial adviser for the transaction, Reuter reports from
Chicago.
The flight kitchens employ about 5,000 people, who prepare more than 125,000
meals daily in 14 cities for United and for other airlines on a contract
basis.

NYKREDIT, the large Danish bond-issuing mortgage credit institution with
total assets of about DKr351bn (Dollars 55.7bn), reported a fall in pre-tax
profits last year to DKr263m from DKr1.10bn in 1991.
Write-offs and provisions for loans increased from DKr1.43bn to DKr1.78bn,
while a gain in 1991 of DKr625m on the value of the securities portfolio
became a loss in 1992 of DKr308m. Operating profits increased by 23 per cent
from DKr1.91bn to DKr2.35bn.
The result was described by the group as acceptable in view on the long
economic recession, which is also expected to affect the 1993 results.
Equity capital and reserves showed little change at DKr17.93bn, which gave a
capital adequacy ratio of 9.3 per cent compared with the 8 per cent legal
minimum, said the group.

Vinyl arm

<TEXT>
BF GOODRICH, the Ohio-based specialty chemical and aerospace products group,
yesterday announced that it is going to spin off its Geon Vinyl division.
Goodrich expects to gain as much as Dollars 310m from an initial public
offering Geon's stock, as well as Dollars 200m in special distributions
before the completion of the offering.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Geon Company
said BF Goodrich intended to offer about 50 per cent of Geon Vinyl stock to
the public, if market conditions were favourable. Geon is expected to assume
about Dollars 30m of BF Goodrich's existing debt.
Geon Vinyl produces vinyl resins and compounds which are used in a variety
of applications, including construction products, business machine
components and appliance parts.
The division is based in Independence, Ohio, and operates 14 manufacturing
plants in the US, Canada, and Australia. Geon Vinyl has 2,500 employees,
while BF Goodrich has about 13,200.
BF Goodrich said Geon Vinyl had revenues of Dollars 950m in 1992, down
slightly from Dollars 981m in 1991. Geon Vinyl logged a net loss of about
Dollars 3.3m last year, and a loss of Dollars 26.5m in 1991.
BF Goodrich itself had revenues of Dollars 2.5bn in 1992, with net income of
Dollars 2.5m and a per share loss of 23 cents.
Mr John Ong, BF Goodrich chairman, said his company intended to use the
proceeds of the Geon Vinyl spin-off to expand Goodrich's specialty chemicals
and aerospace businesses.
Whirlpool, the leading US producer of home appliances, expects its American
sales to increase between 3 per cent and 4 per cent in 1993 from the
previous year, Reuter reports.
Mr William Marohn, chief operating officer said that recovery in the US
would boost sales in the industry by between 3 and 4 per cent this year.
'Based on what we have seen so far in the first quarter, my sense is that we
are still living with that projection,' he said.
Its North American sales were around Dollars 2bn with group sales of Dollars
7.3bn last year.

NORGESKREDITT, the Norwegian private sector mortgage company, yesterday
announced plans to become a commercial bank, following recent approval for
the move by the finance ministry.
The company said it would seek backing for the proposal at its annual
general meeting scheduled for April 1. Norgeskreditt said bank status would
give it access to the domestic retail market which would constitute an
important supplement to financing from the bond market, and thereby
contribute to stability in its funding situation.
'Access to the deposit market, the ability to borrow from the central bank
and membership of the banks' traditional safety net are also anticipated to
have a positive effect for (the group's) bondholders,' Norgeskreditt said.
Norgeskreditt's assets dipped to NKr19.7bn (Dollars 2.8bn) at the end of
December from NKr21.3bn a year earlier. The company strengthened
significantly its capital base through a NKr750m share issue in 1992, when
it converted to a limited company.
In addition, NKr384m of repayable contributions by foundation members was
converted into share capital to boost total capital to NKr1.53bn.
Norgeskreditt's preference shares have been trading on the Olso bourse since
last July.
It said approximately 30 per cent of the preference share capital had
changed hands since the listing, and that about 11.6 per cent of its total
share capital is held by foreign investors.
Separately, the company announced it had returned to the black with net
profits of NKr679.7m in 1992 from losses of NKr16.9m in the previous year.
The turnround was helped by extraordinary income of NKr575.5m, gained from a
change in rules for loan loss provisions allowing these provisions to be
booked on profit and loss accounts. Profits before extraordinary items rose
to NKr131.3m from NKr100.5m, helped by a rise to NKr267.6m in net interest
income from NKr242.3m and a reduction in securities losses to NKr33.8m from
NKr57.9m.
Credit losses, however, rose to NKr66.4m from NKr51.3m in 1991. The company
said that last year it repossessed commercial property with a book value of
NKr34.3m, and that these assets provide a net yield of 8.9 annually.
Norgeskreditt had a capital adequacy of 14.2 per cent of risk-weighted
assets according to Bank for International Settlements rules.

CAMPBELL SOUP, the US foods group, yesterday disclosed a net loss of Dollars
115.9m, or 46 cents per share, in its second quarter ended January 31.
The quarterly deficit was caused by a previously anticipated Dollars 300m
write-off taken in connection with an international restructuring and
divestiture programme that included plant closures. Campbell achieved
Dollars 160.6m net profits, or 64 cents per share, in the same quarter a
year ago.
The New Jersey-based company said its sales reached record levels during the
quarter, having risen by 2 per cent year-on-year to Dollars 1.79bn.
Sales for the first six months of the fiscal year were 6 per cent improved
at Dollars 3.48bn, while net earnings for the six months were Dollars 40.7m,
or 16 cents per share, down from Dollars 289.8m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, in
the first half of the 1992 fiscal year.
Mr David Johnson, president and chief executive of Campbell, said that
before restructuring charges the company's net earnings were actually 18 per
cent higher in the first six months.
'In the teeth of a tough competitive environment worldwide, we have
delivered strong results for the second quarter,' Mr Johnson said. He noted
that Campbell Soup had launched more than 70 new products and said the
group's new strategy would further focus on strong brand names.
Campbell's North and South American division, the single largest business,
reported a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter operating earnings before
restructuring charges. Sales for the division were 4 per cent better at
Dollars 1.29bn.
The biscuit and bakery division had a 2 per cent decrease in operating
earnings before charges with sales 1 per cent lower at Dollars 214.2m in the
quarter.
Operating earnings in the second quarter for Campbell Europe/Asia increased
by 10 per cent before restructuring charges. Sales were 1 per cent lower at
Dollars 290.2m.
On Wall Street, the Campbell Soup share price was Dollars 1 lower at Dollars
40 1/2 .

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Flanders offers Fl 55m to Daf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BELGIUM'S Flemish regional government is prepared to provide Fl 55m (Dollars
29.5m) in capital for a new, slimmed-down Daf, the UK-Dutch truckmaker which
went into receivership two weeks ago.
Mr Luc van den Brande, head of the Flanders government, disclosed this
yesterday after meeting on Tuesday with Daf's receivers and Mr Koos
Andriessen, the Dutch economic affairs minister, in The Hague.
Meanwhile, Daf NV's banks, led by ABN Amro, were expected to have more
meetings with its receivers today to hear details of a proposed
restructuring plan and consider whether to co-operate in any further
refinancing. Current short-term financing of Daf runs out on February 26.
The government of Flanders said the majority of its Fl 55m capital injection
would involve a direct equity stake in both the Dutch and Belgian arms of
the proposed new Daf company. A smaller portion would take probably take the
form of a subordinated loan.
It said the Fl 55m figure would represent 12 per cent of a total of Fl 450m
in shareholders' equity needed to revive Daf. Its equity stake would give it
input into policy at Daf in the Netherlands, while its stake in the Flemish
arm would give it a blocking minority in Flanders.
The Dutch government indicated earlier it would be willing to put up around
Fl 200m to relaunch Daf.
The Belgian financing is conditional on guarantees that the new-style Daf
would employ around 753 people in Flanders, compared with the more than
1,400 people who currently work at the company's cab and axle factory in
Westerlo. It also wants job guarantees for 410 Belgians working at Daf's
headquarters in Eindhoven.
Production of Leyland DAF vans resumed in Birmingham yesterday after
components suppliers, including GKN, resumed deliveries. But lines at the
truck plant in Leyland, Lancashire, were quiet, with suppliers reluctant to
restore delivery. At Birmingham's Washwood Heath plant ''about a dozen''
suppliers are in negotiation with the receivers.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIGOROUS cost-cutting and heavy demand for dental work ahead of reforms to
the German health system helped Degussa, the German metals, chemicals and
drugs group, to increase profits by 14 per cent in its first quarter.
Pre-tax earnings jumped to DM49m (Dollars 30m) in the three months to the
end of December, compared with the 'weak' DM43m last time, the company said
in a letter to shareholders yesterday.
Group sales, up 9 per cent at DM3.3bn, were bolstered by a 37 per cent
increase from the pharmaceuticals division, which increased turnover from
DM384m to DM527m.
The core metals sector saw sales rise 9 per cent to DM1.66bn, including a 20
per cent increase to DM913m in turnover from precious metals, but 'as in the
previous year, there was a substantial loss', the letter said. Precious
metals, meanwhile, showed improved earnings.
Sales from the chemicals division stagnated at DM1bn, although earnings
improved.
The payroll was cut by 2,000 in the last full financial year and a further
530 jobs went in the quarter under review. As a result, group labour costs
rose just 3 per cent in the three months to January.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: France to provide extra capital
to two state-controlled groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government is providing extra capital to two state-controlled
companies by offering FFr1.5bn (Dollars 271m) in equity-linked debt to Air
France and a short-term FFr2.5bn loan to Groupe Bull, the computer company.
The injections come little more than a month before the parliamentary
elections. The ruling socialists are expected to be defeated by the
centre-right coalition, which has made privatisation a central theme in its
campaign.
Air France is to receive its FFr1.5bn of equity-linked debt from Caisse des
Depots et Consignations (CDC), the state-controlled financial institution
that already owns 0.5 per cent of the carrier.
CDC is providing a FFr750m subordinated perpetual loan with share warrants
attached and FFr750m of bonds repayable in shares.
The loss-making airline needs the money for the purchase of 17 aircraft.
Bull, which is struggling back to profit after three years of losses, is to
receive a three-month loan of FFr2.5bn. The government is directly providing
72 per cent with France Telecom, the state-controlled telecommunications
company, contributing the rest.
The two companies are receiving state support at a time when the
government's relationship with public sector companies is under the
spotlight.

RIGOROUS cost-cutting and heavy demand for dental work ahead of reforms to
the German health system helped Degussa, the German metals, chemicals and
drugs group, to increase profits by 14 per cent in its first quarter.
Pre-tax earnings jumped to DM49m (Dollars 30m) in the three months to the
end of December, compared with the 'weak' DM43m last time, the company said
in a letter to shareholders yesterday.
Group sales, up 9 per cent at DM3.3bn, were bolstered by a 37 per cent
increase from the fast-growing pharmaceuticals division, which increased
turnover from DM384m to DM527m.
Even excluding sales from the newly-consolidated Arzneimittelwerk Dresden
and the recently-purchased Sankin Industry, a leading Japanese dental
supplier, turnover in this division rose 10 per cent.
The domestic dental business profited from extra demand created by impending
health service reforms which will oblige patients to pay more for treatment.
However, the reforms will have a negative effect on sales and profits from
the pharmaceuticals business, which has grown rapidly to account around a
fifth of total group turnover.
The core metals sector saw sales rise 9 per cent to DM1.66bn, including a 20
per cent increase to DM913m in turnover from precious metals, but 'as in the
previous year, there was a substantial loss', the letter said. Precious
metals, meanwhile, showed improved earnings.
Sales from the chemicals division stagnated at DM1bn, although earnings
improved.
The management has split the group into three clear divisions, decentralised
decision-making, and thinned down the bureaucracy.
After adjustments for acquisitions, the payroll was cut by 2,000 in the last
full financial year and a further 530 jobs went in the quarter under review.
As a result, group labour costs rose just 3 per cent in the three months to
January.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: CDC profits fall due to
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAISSE des Depots et Consignations (CDC), one of France's largest
state-controlled financial institutions, saw net profits fall by almost 40
per cent to FFr2.1bn (Dollars 380m) last year from FFr3.5bn in 1991 after
making sizeable provisions on its property and equity investments.
Mr Philippe Lagayette, the former deputy director of the Bank of France who
last year replaced Mr Robert Lion as CDC's chairman, said he hoped to see a
return to profits growth this year.
CDC said it was extending its investments by providing FFr1.5bn in
equity-linked debt to Air France, the state-controlled airline. CDC already
has a small stake in the carrier through CDC Participations, one of its
subsidiaries.
Mr Lagayette said CDC's banking activities and other financial operations
had fared well during 1992, with gross profits (before provisions) rising 18
per cent to FFr6.4bn.
However, CDC, like other French financial groups, was affected by the impact
of the economic slowdown on its industrial investments and property
holdings. It also suffered from the poor performance of its cable television
interests, which lost FFr540m during the year.
These problems fuelled a steep increase in overall provisions, which reduced
gross profits to FFr3.3bn, against FFr4.85bn in 1991.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Skopbank narrows losses to
FM3.61bn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LOSSES at Finland's Skopbank narrowed to FM3.61bn (Dollars 609m) in 1992
from FM4.90bn the previous year, despite higher credit losses and
non-performing loans.
The bank, majority owned by the government guarantee fund, said it expected
another big loss this year and it warned it would probably need a further
FM1.5bn in capital support this year, in addition to the FM5.5bn already
received.
Its announcement came as two other Finnish banks, Postipankki and Okobank,
saw their 1992 performance deteriorate, although the latter still managed to
outperform most in the sector by making a profit. Losses deepened at
Postipankki to FM700m from FM135m, while profits shrank at Okobank from
FM274.8m to FM83.8m.
All three banks were hit by the deep Finnish recession, high bankruptcy
levels and rising unemployment. They also suffered from heavy write-offs on
loans to the former Soviet Union.
Skopbank achieved a better result, thanks only to a sharp drop in
extraordinary losses, with its 1992 operating loss at FM3.46bn, actually 14
per cent higher than in 1991.
Credit losses rose 10 per cent to FM2.78bn from FM2.55bn, with 58.5 per cent
of the write-offs stemming from operations in Finland. Income from financial
operations amounted to just FM219m, reflecting the burden of non-performing
loans which at the year-end totalled FM5bn.
Mr Kaarlo Jannari, Skopbank's chief general manager, said its restructuring
programme, which cut operating expenses by 24 per cent to FM1.1bn, could not
make up for the impact of the high level of write-offs and erosion of net
interest income. At December 31 1992, the bank's capital adequacy ratio
stood at 8.2 per cent, just above the international minimum of 8 per cent.

FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Audi presses ahead with new
models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUDI, the luxury car division of Volkswagen, is pressing ahead with its
ambitious development plans in spite a sharp reversal of fortunes this year.
According to Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, 42, the company's new chairman,
production will fall in 1993 by between 10 and 15 per cent because of
falling domestic demand and the effects of the rise of the D-Mark on sales
in important export markets such as Italy.
The slump follows the sudden end of the boom last year, when Audi made
492,000 cars - 9.3 per cent more than in 1991 - and 'a good, positive
operating profit,' Mr Kortum said yesterday. Full details would be announced
in April, he added, although he admitted profits-to-sales ratios had
suffered.
Even so, projects for new models to extend the brand's appeal at both the
top and lower ends of the market remain on schedule. A flagship V8-powered
car with aluminium bodywork will be launched next spring, to be followed
later in the decade by a new version of the old Audi 50 at the bottom of the
range.
The next key decision, which will be made this year, is whether to start
manufacturing in the US. Possible sites are believed to have been narrowed
down to two in Indiana and Kentucky. However, it is still possible that the
hard-pressed parent company may choose the cheaper alternative of extending
its existing VW works in Mexico.
Mr Kortum - the successor to Mr Ferdinand Piech, who last month took charge
at the parent group - is keen to rebuild Audi's reputation and position in
the US market after years of decline. He can probably count on support from
Mr Piech, who has publicly acknowledged that the dangers of failure in the
US market include loss of ground elsewhere.
In Mr Kortum's view, a north American plant is important to guarantee a
place in the North American Free Trade Area (Nafta) and to ensure
competitiveness with other Nafta-based manufacturers, be they Japanese or
US-owned.
Audi sales in the US have started to recover after falling from 75,000 in
1985 to around 12,000 in 1991. Following last year's increase to 14,800, the
more recent past had seen a renewed 'decisive upwards trend' of 30 per cent
monthly growth, Mr Kortum said.
Sales promotions, including discounts and special service deals have also
helped, but Audi models have been made more expensive by the recent
depreciation of the dollar against the D-Mark.

WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank, the state bank for North-Rhein-Westphalia, with the
Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, its Baden-Wurtemmberg associate, will take a
49.9 per cent stake in the Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein in Kiel, it was
announced yesterday.
The move is the latest in a protracted bout of rationalisation within the
German public banking sector which has been lent added complexity by a
scramble to take over the state banking functions for the new Lander, or
states, in the eastern part of Germany.
No price was given for the deal, which has been expected in one form or
another for some months. The shape of the final agreement was surprising,
however, in that it excluded any participation from the Norddeutsche
Landesbank, the Hanover-based state bank which was to have joined forces
with the WestLB to buy a minority stake in the Schleswig-Holstein bank.
Mr Bjorn Engholm, prime minister of Schleswig-Holstein, said yesterday he
regretted that Norddeutsche's participation remained 'out of reach' despite
intensive negotiations which concluded on Sunday. Negotiations had failed
because it had proved impossible to arrange an equitable distribution of the
holding. Under the final agreement, SudwestLB is to take a 9.9 per cent
stake and WestLB a 40 per cent holding in the Kiel-based bank.

earnings slide to FFr200m

<TEXT>
PECHINEY, the state-controlled French aluminium group that this week emerged
as a potential investor in CarnaudMetalBox, the packaging company, saw net
profits fall to around FFr200m (Dollars 36.2m) last year from FFr820m in
1991.
Mr Jean Gandois, chairman, who earlier this week said Pechiney might be
interested in buying the 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalBox owned by
MB-Caradon, the UK building products group, described his group's
performance as 'mediocre' in an interview with Les Echos, the French
financial newspaper.
However, he said that Pechiney International, the packaging company in which
Pechiney has a 67 per cent stake, achieved healthy net profits growth from
FFr842m in 1991 to around FFr2bn in 1992 due to net exceptional gains of
FFr1bn.
News of the forecast fall in Pechiney's profits comes at a time when it,
like other French state-controlled companies, is positioning itself as a
candidate for privatisation after next month's parliamentary elections.
France's conservative coalition, now with a clear lead over the socialists
in the opinion polls, last week announced sweeping privatisation plans.
Mr Gandois said that Pechiney 'should be privatised', but not until its
performance had improved and 'the price of aluminium is a bit higher'.
Pechiney saw sales fall to FFr35.38bn in 1992 from FFr37.37bn for 1991 (this
figure has been restated to allow for the sale of the group's nuclear
interests in July).
It broke even at the operating level in both the first and second half of
1992 and made restructuring provisions of FFr782m.
Pechiney International was forced to set aside FFr600m in restructuring
provisions, but still managed to achieve overall exceptional gains of FFr1bn
because of the proceeds from asset sales.
Mr Gandois said that Pechiney might consider increasing Pechiney
International's capital to expand the business.
He added that the parent company would be willing to reduce its holding, but
only to 50.5 per cent as it intended to retain control.

FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Wimpey to reorganiseland bank structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGE WIMPEY is to reorganise the way in which it buys building plots in an
attempt to avoid the mistakes of the late 1980s when housebuilders were left
with large amounts of overpriced land.
The group, Britain's second largest housebuilder, announced yesterday that
it was to establish a new subsidiary which would be responsible for making
long term land acquisitions.
The company will take over Wimpey's existing long term land portfolio of
more than 2,000 acres and sell the sites on to the group's 10 regional
housebuilding subsidiaries as required.
It will also be expected to generate profits from selling sites to other
housebuilders and earn fees from managing greenfield sites by taking land
owned by outsiders through the planning process to the point of development.
Mr Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's chief executive, said the group's housing division
would be expected to monitor its success by measuring return on capital.
Traditionally, UK housebuilders have evaluated their performance simply by
taking the cost of land and building and deducting this from the sale price
of a home to arrive at a gross margin. Little heed was paid to the cost of
holding land.
This approach worked while high inflation ensured that house and land prices
enjoyed unbroken increases throughout the 1970s and for most of the 1980s.
As a result shares of housebuilders with large tracts of land, acquired many
years earlier at low prices, were often more highly valued than those
working on short duration land banks.
Housebuilders, however, were caught badly at the end of the 1980s when house
and land prices fell steeply, forcing Wimpey and others to make substantial
provisions against land bought at the top of the market.
Wimpey's housebuilding subsidiaries will, in future, be expected to base
land purchases on foreseeable production and house prices. The new
subsidiary, which Mr Dwyer says will work under tight financial disciplines,
will provide a reservoir of longer term land for the group, which expects to
build more than 6,000 homes in the UK this year.
The plan is the work of Mr Richard Andrew, a former executive director of
Scandinavian Bank in the UK, who last year was appointed chairman and chief
executive of Wimpey's housebuilding division.
Mr Dwyer said yesterday that it was an unusual appointment but that it was
felt that a banker would bring the appropriate financial experience to an
area where asset management, increasingly, was the key to profitability.

FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Vardon beats forecast and buys seal
sanctuary for Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VARDON, THE leisure attractions group which runs the London Dungeon, the
York Dungeon and the Sea Life Centres, is acquiring Seal Sanctuary in
Cornwall for Pounds 1.8m in cash and paper.
Separately the group, which obtained its Stock Exchange listing in October,
reported full year pre-tax profits ahead of flotation forecasts.
The seal sanctuary at Gweek, on the banks of the Helford river, was set up
in 1973 and is a profitable visitor attraction based on the rescue, care and
release of injured seals.
It attracts more than 200,000 visitors a year and, after charging interest
and non-recurring items of Pounds 251,000, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 124,000 in the year to end February 1992.
Together with two new Sea Life centres being built in Southend-on-Sea,
Essex, and Scheveningen in the Netherlands, which are due to open later this
year, the acquisition of the Gweek sanctuary will increase Vardon's
operating attractions from 11 to 14.
Vardon's pre-tax profits in the year to December 31 reached Pounds 2.43m,
compared with a flotation forecast of Pounds 2.29m, and Pounds 797,000 in
the previous year.
Turnover increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 9.73m (Pounds 7.62m). The
acquisition of Sea Life has been accounted for as a merger, while the
results of the Dungeons are included from their acquisition at the end of
March last year.
Vardon acquired the Dungeons for Pounds 5.6m from Kunick after Mr David
Hudd, chairman, and Mr Nickolas Irens, chief executive and former finance
director of First Leisure, joined the board of Winchmore, restructured the
company and changed its name.
The latest results include Pounds 171,000 (Pounds 24,000) of investment
income and a Pounds 273,000 extraordinary charge related to the cost and
losses of the sale of Headley Agencies.
Earnings per share of 4.2p were 5 per cent ahead of forecast and the company
is paying a final dividend of 0.5p, making a taotal of 0.75p for the year.
Mr Hudd said the results were 'very pleasing' given the state of the
economy.
Visitor attendances during the year totalled 2.9m, a 6 per cent increase on
a like-for-like basis.

Etonbrook Properties, the development and dealing group, said yesterday that
there had been a dispute as to the beneficial entitlement to 373,000 shares,
some 9.74 per cent of its ordinary equity, currently registered in the name
of Palmerston Investment Trust.
Etonbrook had received a notice from Mr Andrew Perloff, which seeks to
prevent the registration of the transfer of these shares to any other
parties.
The company understood that the reason for the notice was that a group of
existing shareholders, including Mr Keith Moss, managing director, believed
that they were entitled to these shares.

FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Throgmorton Trust net assets decline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fully diluted net asset value per share of Throgmorton Trust was 57.8p
at November 30 1992, against 70.2p a year earlier.
Net revenue for the 12 months fell from Pounds 7.44m to Pounds 6.68m for
earnings per share of 2.35p (2.63p). The recommended final dividend of 1.4p
maintains the total for the year at 2.3p.
Lord Stewartby, chairman, said that although there had been a significant
improvement in the past two months - net assets per share had risen to 71.4p
by January 31 - the figures for the past year related to a period of almost
unprecedented turbulence and difficulty for the financial markets.
During the summer there had been a serious loss of confidence, with a
consequent weakening of UK investment values, the chairman said.
However, since September, the combination of lower interest rates and more
competitive exchange rates had improved the outlook for the economy.
There were now clear signs of positive interest in smaller companies, and
the reduction in the value of the trust's portfolio last year had, by the
end of January, been more than recovered.

FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Rapid development for a bright idea -
Andrew Bolger looks at Menvier-Swain's growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFETY LIGHTS are poised to go on all over Europe, thanks to rapid expansion
by Menvier-Swain Group, a USM-quoted company based in Banbury, north
Oxfordshire.
Menvier, which also makes fire and security alarms, is the leading UK
supplier of emergency lighting for commercial and industrial premises, with
30 per cent of the British market. Its latest French acquisition, Nugelec,
was funded this month by a Pounds 9m rights issue, and expands the group's
European network, which stretches from Denmark to Portugal.
Since being floated in 1986, Menvier's market capitalisation has grown from
Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 82.8m. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.64m on sales of
Pounds 12m post-flotation, and analysts now expect the group to make pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 7.3m on sales of Pounds 51m in the current year to
April.
The success represents the fulfilment of a youthful dream by Mr Roger
Fletcher, 44, the group's chief executive. While studying electronics at
Southampton University in the late 1960s he became friends with an
electrical engineering student, Mr Christopher Swain, whose father Charles
had built up an electrical contracting business in Banbury.
Mr Fletcher said: 'Like all students, Christopher and I used to sit up late
at night drinking coffee and making plans. I always wanted to branch out on
my own.'
Instead, Mr Fletcher joined Marconi and worked for five years on
defence-related electronics. His opportunity came in 1975, when the Swains
approached him and said they could not obtain a decent emergency light.
The Swains invested Pounds 2,000 and Mr Fletcher started working, assisted
by two women, in the attic of one of the stores. Together they developed a
converter enabling a florescent light to switch to battery back-up after an
electricity failure - a product which gave the group eventual leadership of
the UK market.
In 1988, Menvier bought Blessing Electronics, a Netherlands emergency
lighting group, and has since made acquisitions in France, Portugal,
Denmark, Greece and Italy. Most of the deals have been relatively small,
although the group's first French acquisition, Luminox, was funded by a
Pounds 6.6m rights issue in 1989.
Menvier turned to Europe, both because it saw limited scope to increase
market share in the UK, and because the unified European market seemed to
offer exceptional opportunities. EC directives require all new buildings to
be fitted with adequate emergency lighting from this year, and all existing
buildings in northern Europe will need to be upgraded before the end of
1995, with Greece and Portugal being allowed a further two years to upgrade.
Not all Menvier's overseas ventures have been successful. In 1987 it bought
a Boston-based emergency lighting company, but sold it in 1991, having lost
about Pounds 700,000 in what Mr Fletcher now characterises as a useful - if
expensive - learning process.
'We thought we knew better than all the other British companies who have had
their fingers burnt in the States. Over there, all people seemed to be
interested in was the price of our product, whereas in Europe people are
more interested in whether it will do the job.'
The Boston company was a loss-maker, and Menvier has since then avoided
turnrounds. Instead, it has concentrated on buying profitable European
companies with good market positions, offering the vendors earn-out
agreements and shares in the UK group.
Mr Fletcher said Menvier tried to impose very light controls on its
subsidiaries at the operating level, although all must file weekly reports
of sales, cash and stocks. Each country's regulations differ, requiring
particular product adaptions, and Menvier allows individual subsidiaries to
keep their own names and choose whether to identify with the group.
Although the bulk of Menvier's business still comes from emergency lighting,
the group is expanding its fire alarm activity and has identified security
alarms as the 'third layer' which it has started to move into.
Menvier's share price has tripled since early 1991, as institutions have
supported the group's overseas strategy and welcomed the increasing
liquidity of the stock. Mr Christopher Swain, who emigrated to Australia two
years ago, sold his near-20 per cent stake.
His father, who last year stepped down from being executive chairman to
become life president, placed a 16.7 per cent stake this month, but still
holds 3 per cent.
Analysts like the company, which now employs about 1,000 people, but are
concerned that the spread ot its activities might stretch management
resources. Menvier has recognised the concern, and said the group would
concentrate for the next year on consolidation, rather than further
acquisitions.
Mr Fletcher, who has been national champion of the UK's most powerful class
of powerboats for three of the last four years, believes that Menvier can
continue to make headway against the tides of recession. More than half the
group's business comes from continental Europe, and he is even growing more
optimistic about the UK: 'We are at last seeing clear signs of recovery.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: RTZ shares fall on warning of Pounds 52m
provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, fell yesterday after it
revealed that its 1992 results would include exceptional charges totalling
Pounds 52m.
The share price dropped 20p in early trading but later recovered to close at
651p, down 5p.
RTZ said low metals prices were forcing it to curtail operations at its 54
per cent owned Greens Creek mine in Alaska, which produces zinc and lead and
is the biggest silver producer in the US.
About 230 employees are affected.
The group said it hoped to resume operations at Greens Creek when economic
conditions improved but meanwhile it would make a provision of Dollars 48m
(Pounds 32m) after tax against the book value of its investment in the mine.
Greens Creek cost Dollars 114m and started up as recently as 1989. Last year
it produced 6.979m troy ounces of silver, 36,800 tonnes of zinc and 15,100
tonnes of lead - less than 1 per cent of the lead and zinc mined last year
in the world outside the former eastern bloc countries.
RTZ also revealed that Indal, its wholly owned Canadian subsidiary which is
active in a broad range of North American construction-related markets, had
been badly hit by the recession and, after exceptional restructuring costs
of CDollars 38m (Pounds 20m), recorded an after-tax loss for 1992 of
CDollars 58m.
The group said it would be publishing 1992 results next month on the basis
of the new financial reporting standards and would treat both charges as
exceptional items.
RTZ reported net attributable profits of Pounds 308m for 1991 after a Pounds
74m exceptional charge for replacing its copper smelter at Bingham Canyon,
Utah.

FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Control Securities talks continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROL Securities, the property, brewing and hotels group which is
currently negotiating a refinancing deal with its banks, will today announce
interim results up to the end of last September.
It will also call an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to ask authority
for the board to continue negotiations with banks and credit-ors.
The group had hoped to be able to agree terms of the refinancing by the end
of this month and put them to shareholders.
However, negotiations appear to be taking longer than expected, although
people involv-ed stressed this was not necessarily a bad sign.
The shares have been suspended since October 1991, when the group's offices
were raided by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with the investigation
into the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Control was not under investigation, but Mr Nazmu Virani, its former
chairman and chief executive, was arrested in March last year in connection
with BCCI.
Control also said yesterday that the liquidators of BCCI now controlled, and
would be able to vote, 14.9 per cent of Control shares.
BCCI had had a 5.2 per cent stake in Control and other holdings totalling
9.7 per cent had been pledged to the bank. Some of these other shares are
understood to have been owned by the Virani family.

FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Boots sets date for US launch of heart drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS, the retail and pharmaceutical group, said yesterday that it would
launch Manoplax, its new drug for congestive heart failure, in the US on
March 29.
The company's shares rose 6p to 491p.
The drug, which is expected to be a significant profit earner for Boots'
pharmaceutical business through the 1990s, won approval from the US Food and
Drug Administration on December 31.
It was launched in the UK last September, after gaining a product licence in
August. In November Boots said that marketing costs relating to Manoplax had
reached Pounds 8m in the first half of the financial year to September 30,
and would continue at or above that level in the second half.
Boots agreed a co-marketing deal with Parke-Davis, part of Warner-Lambert,
the US drug company, in July 1991 which will cover Manoplax in the US. About
3m Americans suffer from congestive heart failure and 400,000 new cases are
diagnosed each year.
Under the FDA approval, Manoplax is indicated in patients not responding to
or unable to tolerate other treatments. It is hoped that later Manoplax will
be used more widely.
The drug is manufactured in the UK but packaged in the US. Boots is already
building up supplies to the US market. It has a fairly limited use at
present
The price of the drug in the US will be in line with the UK price, at
Dollars 60 (Pounds 42) for 30 50mg or 75mg tablets and Dollars 120 for 60
100mg tablets.

FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Out of favour with US institutions - Peter
John looks at the depressed state of the share prices of UK drug makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK pharmaceuticals stocks are more than out of favour with the big US
institutions.
From late last year, when the US began to scent economic recovery and
jitters developed over President Clinton's administration plans for health
reform, the whole sector has been shunned.
With the added pressure on sterling-based stocks of a 30-cent fall in the
pound against the dollar since last autumn, UK stocks have become
increasingly less popular.
The three UK drug companies with significant exposure to the US - Glaxo,
Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham - have regularly seen their share prices
pick up in the morning in London only to fall back when trading begins on
Wall Street.
Since the close of trading on November 3, the date of the US presidential
election, Glaxo's share price has dropped more than 170p to 662p, Wellcome
has fallen almost 100p to 898p and SmithKline A shares have fallen by the
same amount to 439p.
In contrast, the FT-SE 100 has risen more than 100 points.
Although currency shifts cloud the issue the falls in the UK drug stocks
have been broadly in line with those of their US counterparts.
Over the past three months Glaxo has dropped 26.6 per cent against the S&amp;P
Composite index, SmithKline 23.8 per cent and Wellcome 15.4 per cent.
Meanwhile, Merck has lost 19.3 per cent, Pfizer 23.8 per cent and Lilly 17.8
per cent.
Of the three UK groups, Wellcome generates the highest amount of business in
North America but has the lowest exposure to the US stock market. Some 43
per cent of turnover and 49 per cent of profits come from the region
although only 6.05 per cent of the company's shares, about 52m, were held in
the form of American Depositary Receipts at the last official announcement
in December.
Subsequently, the stake has fallen by about 2m shares but the company argues
that it is not exposed to the threats faced by the industry, particularly
the call for price cuts. 'Historically we haven't particularly been reliant
on price increases but volume growth,' says Wellcome's Mr Mike Wort.
SmithKline has the biggest exposure to the US in share terms, about 27 per
cent, and believes that the ADR holding has fallen by about 0.5 per cent, or
some 56m shares, over the past three months. The company generates about 40
per cent of sales in the US and is heavily exposed to the managed health
care sector which is one of the principal targets for the Clinton reform.
It is also the only one among the three companies to manufacture in Puerto
Rico. There is a belief that President Clinton will cut back existing tax
breaks for companies operating there. Finally SmithKline's main drug,
Tagamet, comes off patent next year.
The greatest sufferer in share price terms has been Glaxo. The company
generates about 38 per cent of sales in the US where, at the last official
count in November, 23.8 per cent of its shares were held as ADRs in New
York.
The company was hesitant of commenting on the falls ahead of today's
announcement of full year profits and is avoiding the temptation to jump the
gun on the Clinton price reforms.
Nevertheless, the political changes in the US only add to worries in some
quarters that Glaxo is too much of a one-drug company and until some new
products are flushed through the research and development pipeline the
shares could remain under presure.
However, Mr Jonathan Gelles, of Wertheim Schroder in New York, argues that
concerns over Zantac and, indeed, over the group as a whole, are overdone.
'We believe that, at these levels, the sector is basing out very firmly
indeed and investors should be taking major positions. The wise man should
be buying Glaxo and Wellcome,' he said.
An interesting point is that the ADR listings of the three companies do not
appear to have changed as greatly as the widespread US selling would
indicate.
One reason for this is the trickle-down effect of small retail investors
picking up stock offloaded by the big institutions.
Also, in the UK where the attitude to the sector is more positive, some
institutions have been buying via the ADRs.

FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad renews its attack on
Airtours' bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS ABROAD yesterday launched its most robust defence against the hostile
Pounds 215m bid from rival Airtours, claiming the smaller group was
exaggerating the quality of its management.
Owners Abroad said that not only did the Airtours shares included in the
offer undervalue the group, they would also leave Owners Abroad shareholders
with an interest in a group that was facing fundamental problems with its
own business.
The latest defence, delivered in a letter to shareholders, comes days before
the Office of Fair Trading is to recommend to the trade and industry
secretary whether the Airtours bid should be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
Owners focuses particularly on Airtours' relatively new Airtours
International aircraft operation. It accuses Airtours of choosing a
September end for its financial year in order to inflate profits.
It asked whether Airtours chose its year end just before 'empty legs' are
flown - the flights at the end of the holiday season when aircraft pick up
passengers from resorts but carry none out. In this way Airtours was able to
take the profit from the holidays sold but defer the cost of the empty legs
as long as it was adding passengers year on year.
Owners Abroad also said that part of the huge increase in Airtours' profits
resulted from additions to the aircraft fleet.
As long as Airtours was adding aircraft to its fleet just before the summer
 -as it has been doing - it would each year take the benefit of a greater
number of profitable summer aircraft than loss-making winter aircraft.
Owners asked what would happen once Airtours' fleet size had stabilised. The
document asked whether Airtours was trying to buy its way out of trouble. It
questioned whether recent Airtours' approaches to other tour operators such
as Cosmos, Aspro, Iberotravel, and Unijet, represented a clearly defined
strategy for growth 'or just a desperate need to buy almost anything with a
meaningful market share in an attempt to bolster volume'.
Owners Abroad also released its annual report and accounts, which revealed
that net asset value had risen only Pounds 700,000 in the year to October,
in spite of pre-tax profits of Pounds 25.5m.
The difference was the result of a more conservative treatment of goodwill
in connection with the 1991 acquisition of Olympic Holidays.
The accounts also revealed that the highest paid Owners Abroad executive
earned Pounds 418,000 and the chairman earned Pounds 364,000 during the
year, some of it in respect of the two previous financial years.

FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: GPG buys Brown Shipley stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMOOTH passage of Brown Shipley Holdings, the investment and broking
business, into the arms of its largest shareholder was called into question
yesterday when it was disclosed that Guinness Peat Group had bought shares
at above the offer price.
GPG, the UK investment vehicle for Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand
entrepreneur, has bought a 7.5 per cent stake in BSH. The last purchase of
shares was at 33p, which is 3p above Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise's offer.
KBL already owns 29.8 per cent of the equity.
The move by GPG was welcomed by one shareholder who said it was proving
difficult to decide whether KBL's offer was adequate.
BSH's share price gained 2p to close at 35p.
GPG would only say it had taken the stake for investment purposes. In last
November's document accompanying the lifting of a near-two-year suspension
of its shares, it said it planned to identify opportunities for acquisition
and investment particularly in the UK 'to achieve a more even balance
between the level of investment in Europe and Australasia.'
Two weeks ago BSH's board reluctantly recommended KBL's offer, which values
the group at Pounds 4.8m against net assets of Pounds 8.1m.
The sale appeared a forced one because KBL was about to pass on claims of up
to Pounds 2.4m arising from its purchase of Brown Shipley &amp; Co, the merchant
bank, last year.
When news of the claims and KBL's potential offer broke, BSH's share price
fell from 51p to 35p.

FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Mersey Docks 24% higher at Pounds 16.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERSEY DOCKS and Harbour reported a third successive record year for 1992,
with pre-tax profits up 24 per cent from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 16.4m.
Turnover showed a similar increase to Pounds 86.4m, against Pounds 69.5m.
Tonnage through the port was up 12 per cent at 27.8m tonnes (24.74m tonnes),
partly a result of the company taking over Coastal, an Irish Sea container
line, in 1991.
Improved margins reflected tight cost control, plus benefits from joint
ventures or subsidiaries in shipping services, stevedoring, security,
management consultancy and warehousing.
Earnings per share were 18.01p (16.98p). A proposed final dividend of 5p
brings the total to 7.5p (6p).
Although 1992 was the first year in which the company faced a full tax
charge, Mr Bill Slater, chairman, said earnings compared well with the last
tax-free year of 1990, when the figure was 17.92p.
There was no contribution from property development, although sales of land
and shares in subsidiaries amounted to Pounds 1.59m. This was offset by
severance costs and exceptional maintenance on the Port of Liverpool
Building totalling Pounds 1.58m.
The results, together with the return to a full tax charge, marked the end
of 22 years of reconstruction following the government's rescue of the old
Mersey Docks and Harbour Board which came close to defaulting on its bonds
in 1970.
The rescue forbade dividends while the company owed the government money,
but the government wrote off Pounds 111.5m of repayable grants and loans -
used for modernisation - in 1989.
The company now employs 1,640 people - fewer than half of them dockers,
compared with 7,000 dockers in the mid-1970s.
Mr Slater said the government, the biggest shareholder, had told the company
it had no immediate plans to sell its 20.67 per cent stake.
Mr Trevor Furlong, managing director, said Mersey Docks was still looking to
buy an east coast port that would provide synergy at the European end of a
UK land bridge. Liverpool is now a principal hub for transatlantic, Irish,
Mediterranean and West African cargoes.
Development within Mersey Docks includes PowerGen's Pounds 40m coal
terminal, which starts working this year, and a new timber products
warehouse. A euro rail terminal for the Channel Tunnel is complete, as is a
business park in Birkenhead.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Emap buys 14 Thomson titles for Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON Corporation, the Can-adian-controlled travel and publishing group,
has sold 14 business magazines, three directories and some related
exhibition interests for Pounds 20.65m to Emap, the rapidly growing UK
publishing group.
The sale includes such titles as Drapers Record and CTN, which is read by
newsagents. It comes a day after Thomson in Canada said it would be
substantially slimming down its 70-strong free newspaper business in the UK
through sale or merger.
Mr Robert Kiernan, managing director of Thomson Information Services Ltd,
said Emap had made an offer which had 'prompted a strategic review'. 'While
still recognising that these were a strong portfolio of major brands, we
acknowledged that the business had moved away from TISL's core development
area,' Mr Kiernan said.
On the business side, the sale leaves Thomson with a handful of titles,
including Construction News and International Financing Review, as well as a
large number of professional tax and legal publications.
For Emap, the acquisition represents a further consolidation of its position
as one of the UK's most substantial business publishers. With 65 titles,
after acquisition, Emap's business publication sales will rise to about
Pounds 70m, about Pounds 30m short of the market leader, Reed International.
This represents a doubling of Emap's business publications business in the
past 18 months.
Emap said the titles it has acquired complemented its existing magazines, it
was not interested in the pursuit of size for the sake of it. Emap bought 26
of its titles from Maxwell Business Communications last March for Pounds
21.5m. Four of the magazines - TV World, Screen International,
Communications International and International Broadcasting, with combined
sales of Pounds 4.75m - have continental European circulation and
advertising revenue.
The titles acquired had sales of Pounds 18.9m in the year to December 1992
and were loss making. Emap will be funding the acquisitions from the Pounds
78m proceeds of its rights issue last June.
Mr Colin Morrison, chairman of Emap Business Publishing, said that the deal
with Thomson had been done 'very quickly in the last couple of weeks - most
of the work was done in the last three days'.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Clean break from acquisition strategy: Metallgesellschaft is
selling assets and providing environmental services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive of the Metallgesellschaft mining and
industrial group, has pursued one of the most aggressive acquisition trails
of any German company in the four years he has been chief executive. But
now, in a turnround of this strategy, the company is about to embark on a
large-scale programme of asset sales.
As Mr Schimmelbusch an-nounced last week, the plan is to sell non-core
businesses to raise nearly DM1bn (Pounds 400m) by the end of the next
financial year. He is not saying which companies are for sale but he has
been through the group's 258 subsidiaries and a list of potential targets
has been prepared.
This strategic reorientation - combined with a 40 per cent cut in capital
spending this year - follows two difficult years for the company. In the
year to end-September 1992 pre-tax profits fell 23 per cent to DM245m, in
spite of a 20 per cent rise in turnover to DM25.6bn reflecting acquisitions.
In the previous year, profits had dropped 35 per cent from DM483m in 1990.
The combination of the poor figures and the switch in strategy raise
fundamental questions about what Mr Schimmelbusch - a 48-year old Austrian
who worked for a Wall Street investment bank before he joined
Metallgesellschaft more than 20 years ago - has achieved during his time as
chief executive.
'We diversified because we were about to lose our shirt, our last shirt,'
says Mr Schimmelbusch. 'We had to get out] Five years ago, we decided that
it was essential to reduce our dependency on low-value added cyclical
commodities like zinc and copper and base our future on the
commercialisation of the technology we had developed to clean up our own
metals business.'
Over the five years, the group has spent at least DM1bn on smaller
acquisitions. In addition, Metallgesellschaft completed one of Germany's
largest corporate transactions at the beginning of last year with the
DM1.45bn acquisition of the non-paper divisions of Feldmuhle Nobel from
Stora of Sweden. These include Buderus (heating equipment, building
materials and stainless steel goods) and the Dynamit Nobel explosives and
plastics company.
The net result of the strategy is that via 88 subsidiaries in the sector,
Metallgesellschaft has annual turnover of DM4bn in environmental services
such as recycling, pollution control and decontamination. This, Mr
Schimmelbusch boasts, makes Metallgesellschaft the biggest environmental
services group in Europe.
'There is an endless market in eastern Europe,' he says, confident that the
move into environmental services was correct. He points to 12
de-sulphurisation plants commissioned last year - one in Ukraine, two in
Russia, three in Czechoslovakia and six in Poland - which brought DM500m of
revenue.
Environmental services may indeed be the market of the future, but for now
profits from this area are not large. In fact, if the purpose of the
diversification was to reduce the group's dependence on the cyclical base
metals markets, it has not succeeded. Along came the next slump, and the
group's profits tumbled as if there had been no diversification programme.
'We would have sailed through the downturn quite happily', says Mr
Schimmelbusch, 'had the former Soviet Union not broken apart. When we were
at the very height of our diversification programme we were hit by a massive
flood of imported metals from the former Soviet Union.'
He says that average non-ferrous metal prices have dropped by Dollars 200 a
tonne over the past two years. 'When you're producing 1.2m tonnes a year,
this leads to a substantial amount of lost earnings,' he says.
Even without the influx of cheap metals from the east, there would have been
problems. 'The corporate hospital is always full,' Mr Schimmelbusch says.
The sickest patient in this hospital is Kolbenschmidt, Metallgesellschaft's
car components subsidiary. Exposed to the full brunt of the downturn in the
world car industry, Kolbenschmidt lost DM88.6m last year before tax. 'We
would have been able to compensate for this, for everything, if it had not
been for the imports from the east,' Mr Schimmelbusch argues. But he
concedes that one big problem is of the company's own making.
Mr Schimmelbusch says he and his board were aware of the irony of a base
metal producer - one of the world's dirtiest industries - setting itself up
as a provider of environmental services. It was important to bring the
group's smelters up to the highest possible standards of cleanliness. Now,
the smelters look like 'pharmaceutical factories, with people walking around
in white coats'.
This cost in excess of DM1bn over the past five years, money which Mr
Schimmelbusch now admits was spent too hastily and in too large quantities.
Customers have not appreciated the fact that their zinc or lead was produced
in a more environmentally friendly way than a cheaper, dirtier version.
Earlier this month, Metallgesellschaft said it would be closing its
Ruhr-Zinc smelter for two months from the middle of April.
The time will come when all producers in Europe will have to meet the high
standards set by Metallgesellschaft, Mr Schimmelbusch believes. But in the
meantime the group has to concentrate on making itself more profitable and
winnowing down its portfolio of businesses.
In the UK or the US, such a consolidation phase would often be seized upon
as an opportunity to launch a hostile bid - especially as the stock market
value of Metallgesellschaft's holding in other quoted companies exceeds its
own market value of DM2.9bn. 'Some cold capitalist with no heart for the
environment would make a bid and sell off the holdings,' jokes Mr
Schimmelbusch.
He is free from such pressures as 70-75 per cent of the company's shares are
in the hands of safe, long-term shareholders such as Deutsche Bank, Allianz
and Dresdner Bank. They, Mr Schimmelbusch says, are prepared to be patient.
Anything but patient, Mr Schimmelbusch jumps up and brings the interview to
a close with a half-joke: 'I have to go now and sell some companies to
improve the group's profitability.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / Bellway issues Pounds 33.6m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BELLWAY yesterday became the first UK housebuilder to take advantage of the
recent revival in house sales to announce a rights issue. It is seeking to
raise Pounds 33.6m from a two-for-seven issue at 320p. Bellway's share price
fell 2p to 394p on the news.
The last round of cash calls by housebuilders was in 1991, when many
companies took advantage of a short-lived improvement in house sales to
strengthen their balance sheets.
Mr Amarjit Chhina, construction analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said
yesterday that further rights issues for builders were likely. 'Some
companies still need desperately to reduce debt and bolster balance sheets.
Others, like Bellway, will seek opportunistically to exploit the recent rise
in construction share prices on the back of a perceived revival in the
housing market,' he said.
Bellway, which raised Pounds 25m in a five-for-eleven issue at 220p in March
1991, said yesterday that it needed the money to expand output from an
expected 2,200 homes during the 12 months to the end of July, to 4,000 homes
a year by the mid-1990s, which would make it one of the six largest
housebuilders in the country.
Bellway said that the number of house sales agreed by the company had risen
by 50 per cent since the beginning of this year, compared with the
corresponding period in 1992. It forecast that pre-tax profit in the year to
the end of July would be not less than Pounds 16m, compared with Pounds
13.02m in 1991-92.
Mr Alan Robson, finance director, said total dividends should be at least
maintained, on the increased share capital, at last year's level of 11.5p.
He said the group had net cash of about Pounds 15m on shareholders' funds of
approaching Pounds 100m. He expected gearing to reach 10 per cent by 1994 as
the group expanded.
Cash raised in the 1991 rights issue had been used to expand the group's
regional operations and increase its land holdings from 5,500 plots with
planning permission to 7,000, said Mr Robson. The number of homes built by
the group has risen from 1,500 in 1990-91 to 1,841 last year and 2,200 in
the current year.
Bellway said that its latest issue has been fully underwritten by
Charterhouse Bank.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Seaq to list Russian venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the few eastern European ventures listed on a western stock market
will make its debut today on Nasdaq, the US over-the-counter market, and
will shortly also be traded on London's Seaq International share market.
Petersburg Long Distance, which owns part of an international telephone
system in St Petersburg, is thought to be the only publicly traded stock
which gives equity investors a straight exposure to the Russian economy.
The listings on Nasdaq and Seaq International follow a move by one of the
original investors to place its 29 per cent stake in the venture through
Smith New Court, the London-based securities house, for Dollars 24m (Pounds
16.6m).
The company's main asset is a 50 per cent holding in PeterStar, a joint
venture company partly owned by the St Petersburg city authorities.
PeterStar, formed last year, is setting up an international telephone
service aimed mainly at other western joint ventures and tourists in the
area. It will charge customers in US dollars.
The company's system is already connected to St Petersburg's Grand Hotel
Europe, and is expected to be linked to two other hotels in the next two
months. It is only the second international telephone ex-change in the
former Soviet Union, after Moscow's 10,000-line exchange.
PeterStar chairman Mr Gordon Owen, a former group managing director of Cable
and Wireless, said the project involved few technical or financial risks,
and that the main risks for investors were likely to be political ones.
Shares in Petersburg Long Distance, which are already quoted on the Toronto
stock market, have proved volatile in recent months. Since the venture was
set up a year ago they have risen from a low of CDollars 5 each to a high of
CDollars 12. Earlier this week, they were trading at CDollars 9 3/8 ,
valuing the company - which expects to come into profit this year - at
nearly CDollars 75m (Pounds 41m). The shares are held mainly by specialist
funds.
The venture joins a small group of Hungarian companies listed in Vienna, and
just three listed funds investing in the region, as the only vehicles
available to western stock market investors looking to put money into
eastern Europe.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Rhone-Poulenc foresees full privatisation after election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RHONE-POULENC, the chemical group in which the French government holds a 43
per cent stake, yesterday raised the possibility that it would be fully
privatised soon after the elections in March when the Socialist government
is expected to be defeated.
Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, finance director, said that if, as he expected,
the new government sold its entire stake, the privatisation would be worth
between FFr12bn and FFr15bn (Pounds 1.9bn). He also raised the possibility
of a simultaneous rights issue to reduce the group's debts, currently
FFr33.7bn.
Announcing Rhone-Poulenc's full-year results, Mr Jean Rene Fourtou, group
chairman, warned that the state of the European economy was worse than
during the 1973 oil shock and would show no signs of improvement until next
year at the earliest.
Operating income rose 8.1 per cent to FFr6.7bn but sales dropped 2.5 per
cent to FFr81.7bn, with all divisions apart from health registering falls.
Mr Fourtou predicted the group's profitability would increase over the next
three years.
Net debt to equity, which Rhone-Poulenc had predicted last year would fall
to 70 per cent, rose to about 80 per cent, or FFr33.7bn. The group benefited
from a fall in net interest payments from FFr3.4bn to FFr3.2bn.
Operating profits from health activities increased 16 per cent to FFr5bn.
Turnover rose only 4.2 per cent to FFr30.5bn, because of disposals and
adverse exchange rates. The agrochemicals division saw operating profits
fall from FFr1.2bn to FFr900m. In volume terms, sales fell 8 per cent
following farmers' concerns about reforms of the EC's common agricultural
policy. Mr Fourtou said the reforms could cut the size of the European
agrochemical market by up to 30 per cent.
The speciality chemicals division reported operating profits up from FFr100m
to FFr600m on turnover of FFr14.4bn (FFr14.8bn). The organic and inorganic
intermediates division saw a 5 per cent fall in prices and operating profits
fell from FFr800m to FFr500m. Operating profits at the fibres and polymers
division fell from FFr700m to FFr500m.
Net earnings per ordinary share rose 24.7 per cent to FFr25.6. The group is
paying a dividend of FFr18 (FFr15.75).

FT  18 FEB 93 / Frustrated or furious? Charterline will answer all queries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURIOUS with the local council? Wild about your water bill? Hopping mad with
a hospital? Livid with the taxman?
Help could soon be only a telephone call away according to the government,
which yesterday put a face - or a voice - behind Mr John Major's cherished
Citizen's Charter.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, announced details of
Charterline, a new telephone helpline 'designed to help people who find it
daunting or frustrating to get information from large bureaucracies'.
The announcement came at the end of the third six-monthly Downing Street
seminar on the charter, intended to ensure that the impetus behind the
initiative is not lost.
Once Charterline goes nationwide from the end of the year, the full
resources of the Citizen's Charter will be at the disposal of the ordinary
citizen - and all for the price of a local telephone call.
A call to Charterline will give access to details of the complaints
procedures of more than 1,400 public organisations, from British Rail to
Basildon district council, from the Inland Revenue to the Apple and Pear
Development Council.
The well-groomed operators - to be known as Customer Service Representatives
 -will tell you what standards of service you are entitled to and how to get
re-dress when these are not met.
CSRs will be under instructions to answer the phone in four rings. They
should be sympathetic but never give an opinion on a public service. And
they must never lose their tempers.
And if you cannot find satisfaction through the usual channels, Charterline
will tell you which ombudsman to approach. If there is no ombudsman, there
will be someone else who can take up your case, such as the independent
adjudicator announced yesterday to deal with complaints about the Inland
Revenue.
Apart from providing useful information for complaints, Charterline will
allow Mr Waldegrave to see those public services which do not make the
grade. They will be 'helped' to upgrade their customer handling procedures
and perhaps even install their own helplines.
A pilot study, which will be contracted out to a private telephone services
operator, is to be launched in May. It will cover Leicestershire, Derbyshire
and Nottinghamshire, three counties which research indicates are a microcosm
of the UK.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Generators told to pay part cost of pit rescue: Government
ultimatum on five-year coal plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has warned the two main electricity generators in England and
Wales that they or their customers must agree to carry part of the cost of
taking more coal to keep pits open or it will force them to do so through
legislation.
The threat - revealed in a leaked memorandum and letter by Mr John Baker,
the chief executive of National Power - was made earlier this month in
heated talks between Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and
National Power and PowerGen.
It demonstrates the difficulties that the government is having in persuading
the two companies to take the 65.5m tonnes of extra coal over five years
that it believes is necessary to win backbench approval for a pits rescue
plan.
If it is unable to secure a deal it would have to completely revise its
strategy for saving about a dozen of 31 threatened pits.
The documents, sent anonymously to Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the
National Union of Mineworkers, show that the generators have agreed that
they could use an additional 40m million tonnes over the five years.
They are also prepared to stockpile a further 15m tonnes against future
usage provided British Coal - or the government - is prepared to meet the
cost. That is not on offer.
However, the generators say there is no market for the 65.5m tonnes.
The government plan, revealed in the documents, involves British Coal
supplying 15.5m tonnes next year and 15, 14, 11 and 10 in the subsequent
years.
Although the memorandum and letter were written in the first week of
February, the generators have not changed their position substantially since
then. Unless the government is prepared to lower its targets - and thereby
risk backbench opposition to any plan it produces - the likelihood is that a
white paper is unlikely this month as the government had hoped.
In his memorandum, intended for use within the company, Mr Baker quotes
himself as having told Mr Heseltine that 'matters had come to an
extraordinary point if the government saw itself at risk of losing office,
of sacrificing the whole of its energy policy and of intending to
restructure several of the energy industries all because of the sake of
10.5m tonnes of coal'.
The minute says that Mr Heseltine 'said that if we couldn't take the
additional tonnage he would be forced to legislate . . . in so far as there
were further costs, they should simply be passed to the customer'.
In his letter to Mr Heseltine, Mr Baker says of the tonnages above 40m:
'Yesterday . . . you indicated for the first time that you expected the
shareholders (of National Power and PowerGen) to carry the burden. It is now
clear to us that in responding so positively to your requests to find more
space for British coal, we were unwittingly invited to dig our own grave
somewhat deeper.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / UN tells Bosnian factions to allow full-scale relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS, ROBERT MAUTHNER and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, NEW YORK, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council last night called on the warring
factions in Bosnia-Hercegovina to allow full-scale humanitarian relief
operations to resume.
It was stung into issuing the demand after a surprise decision by Mrs Sadako
Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, to suspend almost all aid
deliveries because of political interference.
While the council backed Mrs Ogata's decision, some diplomats privately
criticised her for bringing the issue to a head without consulting them.
Mrs Ogata said that political leaders on all sides had 'made a mockery' of
UN efforts to get food and medical aid through to people caught up in the
ethnic conflict in the former Yugoslav republics. 'I have done everything I
can to persuade leaders to distinguish humanitarian aid from the conflict,'
Mrs Ogata told a news conference in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
Deliveries to the besieged city of Sarajevo are being blocked by the Bosnian
government to draw attention to the plight of Moslems stranded in towns in
eastern Bosnia. Serb forces meanwhile are preventing aid getting through to
the Moslems in those towns.
UNHCR officials said a 10-lorry convoy bound for the Moslem enclave of
Cerska, eastern Bosnia, would be ordered to return to Belgrade. Serb forces
blocked the convoy again yesterday for the fourth day, as well as holding up
a convoy heading for besieged Moslems in Gorazde, south of Cerska.
Mrs Ogata said blocked convoys would be moved back to their bases and all
relief activities in Serbian-controlled Bosnia suspended immediately.
All UNHCR activities in Sarajevo would be suspended and all staff withdrawn,
leaving only a skeleton UNHCR presence. Land convoys and the airlift to
Sarajevo would also be suspended.
Relief operations in areas of Bosnia where UNHCR could still operate would
be maintained at a reduced level.
Mrs Ogata said Serb and Bosnian leaders would have to signal a clear
commitment to giving the UN access before aid could be resumed.
Backing her up, the Security Council condemned the blocking of relief
supplies. It said this was endangering the lives of aid workers and putting
the civilian population at risk.
It demanded that all parties in the Bosnia conflict give Mrs Ogata the
guarantees she is seeking to allow a full-scale aid programme to resume
immediately.
Mr Yuli Vorontsov, the Russian ambassador to the UN, described Mrs Ogata's
move as 'a rather unexpected decision'.
Lord Owen, the EC peace mediator on the former Yugoslavia, said he
understood the 'frustration and anger' that led to Mrs Ogata's move, but
said aid must be restored as soon as possible.
Lord Owen and his co-mediator, Mr Cyrus Vance, will today meet the newly
appointed US and Russian envoys to the peace talks, with the optimistic aim
of reaching agreement with the warring factions by the end of the month.
British troops in Bosnia returned fire twice last night after coming under
attack in a disputed village. Army headquarters at the Croatian port of
Split said there were no casualties among the British forces.

FT  18 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Bellway
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent flurry of evidence hinting at a housing market recovery is
rapidly developing into a storm. Yesterday, Bellway echoed the experience of
other housebuilders by revealing a 50 per cent increase in reservations
since the start of the year. Low interest rates and cheap and steady house
prices finally appear to have stimulated the market, particularly for
first-time buyers.
Doubts must remain about whether the upturn in activity can be sustained.
Unemployment is still growing and negative equity constrains demand. While
Bellway was happy enough to call the turn, its cautious management was only
prepared to back its hunch with other people's money. Its Pounds 33.6m cash
call certainly looks cheeky. With cash of around Pounds 15m in the bank from
its last rights issue, Bellway could easily have geared up with bank
borrowings.
Nevertheless, such opportunism highlights the relative strength of nimble
second tier housebuilders. Bigger competitors, such as Tarmac, are too
financially constrained to fund much expansion. Investors, who have bid up
the construction sector by 20 per cent in the past three months, may worry
about increasing their exposure by backing the string of rights issues which
will doubtless follow. Or they may see plenty more room for recovery. The
80-odd construction stocks still have a combined market value of less than
Pounds 4bn. That is about the same as Argyll or National Power.

FT  18 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems that Opec's feet were not sufficiently close to the fire when the
cartel met in Vienna last weekend. The rebound in the oil price since
Christmas reduced pressure on producers to announce convincing cuts. Four
days of discussion to patch up an agreement will hardly persuade the market
that the cartel really intends to make cuts. Indeed, with Saudi Arabia's
production 45 per cent higher than before the Gulf War, its apparent
reluctance to trim gives a poor lead.
Perhaps most Opec members are maintaining their market share against the day
that Iraq is re-admitted to the world market. But unless attitudes change
and quotas are more strictly enforced, crude prices are likely to languish.
That gives little support to the big oil companies who have also seen their
refining and marketing operations squeezed by the world recession.
With revenues under pressure, US companies have switched to cost cutting as
a way of boosting earnings, and the habit is spreading. It will be
interesting to see how much of these savings the oil majors can hang on to,
and how much leaks away in competitive market pressures. Given the
overcapacity in refining and chemicals, the omens are not good. Highly
geared companies are thus exposed. They may have better recovery prospects
once growth resumes, but with Europe and Japan in recession and the US
recovery hesitant, the likes of BP face an endless climb without fresh
equity.

FT  18 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Accounting Standards Board gets its way, that large portion of UK
companies currently floating off-balance sheet will soon come back into
view. Its latest proposals are admirably clear: companies should show assets
and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet if they enjoy economic
benefits or face risks. In theory, the market should then be able to assess
the real rate of return on assets and the true extent of gearing. Whether
the ASB has done enough to frustrate the financial engineers remains an open
question.
The tighter definition of a subsidiary introduced by the 1989 Companies Act
has already put a stop to the more obvious abuses of off-balance sheet
finance. Yet complex sale and repurchase agreements using options are all
too common, notably in the leisure and property sectors. The ASB insists
such assets should be shown in the main accounts if the option to repurchase
is likely to be exercised. That will be open to interpretation. One can only
hope the combination of plain language and explicit examples will be enough
to hold the line.
The ASB deserves credit, though, for backing away from rules which would
have stopped banks taking assets off-balance sheet by securitising through
the capital markets. That would have placed the UK financial sector at a
competitive disadvantage. Yesterday's draft marks a common-sense compromise:
banks will have to show all assets on the face of the balance sheet, but can
include a figure net of securitisation alongside. Purists might complain at
this proliferation of categories. But a treatment which accurately reflects
the transfer of risk and the retention of reward is the kind of innovation
the market should welcome.

FT  18 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Budget shopping
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont continues to give every impression of succumbing to
short-termism. When the last set of retail sales and unemployment figures
turned out disappointing, his knee-jerk response was a full point cut in
interest rates. Yesterday's improved retail sales figures for January
prompted a quick assertion that there is now no room for more. Perhaps
today's employment data will support that stance. But it will be awkward if
next month sees another run of poor figures. Mr Lamont cannot easily change
his mind again.
It is not as if business on the high street is booming. January's 1.6 per
cent rise in retail sales after December's 1 per cent fall points to faulty
seasonal adjustment. The underlying trend shows only modest growth. Sales in
the three months to January rose only 0.2 per cent over the previous three
months. The main advance came from department stores able to offer large
discounts and from food stores. If last Friday's inflation figures are
anything to go by, demand was not strong enough to allow the latter to raise
their prices much despite the devaluation. The basic message remains the
same: consumers are prepared to spend, but not on credit and only if there
is a price incentive.
That should not tie the chancellor's hand. The real constraint is
self-imposed. After a succession of warnings from the Bank of England, Mr
Lamont has felt obliged to play along. But he may have deprived himself of
the opportunity to announce a rate cut in the budget - unless he is also
planning some painful fiscal tightening.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Leading Article: An overmighty president
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSULTATIVE committee set up by President Francois Mitterrand last
November, to consider reform of the French constitution, has produced a
useful clutch of detailed proposals for up-dating and reforming the French
constitution. None of them is dramatic; most of them are rather
constructive; cumulatively, they should strengthen the position of the
government, enhance the role of the parliament, and in general improve the
democratic process.
On the most central issue, however, the report is a disappointment; for the
committee has balked at two key questions: should the president's
policy-making power be more clearly defined (and circumscribed), and should
his time in office be more restricted?
On paper, the functions granted to the president are those of an ultimate
arbiter above the political fray; in practice, every president since General
de Gaulle has exercised dominant authority in foreign policy and defence;
and as a result of creeping presidentialism, there is now virtually no
aspect of public business which is not subject to President Mitterrand's
influence. If the constitution has a serious defect, it is that the
president's power is not merely untrammelled (because undefined), but also
irresponsible (in the literal sense of the term) because it is uncontrolled.
The committee walks gingerly round the issue, but leaves it in a fudge.
Shorter term
The power of the presidency is manifestly due partly to the length of the
mandate, which is seven years renewable, and which allows the president to
outlast any government. Many political leaders, including President
Mitterrand, have argued for various forms of shorter term; but the committee
was unable to agree on any alternative.
These two shortcomings are regrettable. By most criteria, France has been
(and continues to be) well-governed, and there is no serious justification
for minority demands for a wholesale change of republic. But creeping
presidentialism has contributed to the growing wave of popular discredit,
which has affected both the image of the president and the reputation of the
political class.
If President Mitterrand's popularity is at a low ebb, it is both because he
is held responsible for the policy failures of the Socialist government, and
because he stands aloof with all the trappings of an absolute republican
monarch. If the Socialist party is unpopular, it is partly because of the
combined effect of high unemployment and low financial scandals, but partly
because parliament's reputation is necessarily depreciated by the tentacular
power of the president.
Useful reforms
Despite having avoided the central issue, the committee has proposed some
useful reforms. The legitimacy of new governments will be enhanced if they
have to secure a parliamentary vote of confidence. The National Assembly
should become more influential, if members are forbidden to double up as
mayors of large towns or as regional presidents, and if ex-ministers
automatically recover their seats in parliament. The political class may
regain some popular respect, if it cannot twist the electoral system except
by a two-thirds majority. Governments may pay more attention to public
opinion, if MPs or even ordinary voters can mobilise popular referenda.
At the end of the day, however, the committee seems content that France
should continue to live under a presidential system, with all its advantages
and all its disadvantages. So far the system has proved remarkably
resilient; but it may be severely tested if the March general elections
produce a serious political conflict between an ageing president at the
tail-end of his second term of office, and a combative conservative
government with a 200-seat majority in parliament.
The issue of the presidential mandate is not closed, however. A draft law
for reforming the constitution will be laid before the Senate some time next
month, and it will obviously follow the recommendations of the committee.
But the new conservative majority in the parliament which will be elected in
March could well impose an amendment to shorten the presidential term.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Clinton's state of the Union
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MR CLINTON is not the first
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and will not be the last - elected politician to abandon what he promised
during an election campaign. Nor is he the first to give as his excuse the
unexpectedly dire state of the public-sector finances. The Republicans hope
that voters will blame him for abandoning his 'middle-class tax cut'. Having
bought votes on the basis of promises he knows he ought not to keep, Mr
Clinton is certainly taking a gamble in the tax increases he now proposes.
But what matters most is not whether the president's lips were worth reading
during the campaign. It is whether they are worth reading now.
Mr Clinton is a Democrat. Unsurprisingly, therefore. his economic plan
represents a decisive shift from 12 years of Republican rule. Higher taxes
are certain, with the planned increase amounting to well over 1 per cent of
US gross domestic product. Meanwhile, the spending cuts are supposed to be
greater than the planned increases in spending. This is not so much a case
of 'tax and spend' as of 'tax and reallocate spending'.
The fact of higher taxation - Dollars 240bn more over four years - is not
the decisive indicator of the change. It is the nature of those taxes. Some
70 per cent of the increase in taxation is to be contributed by people
earning over Dollars 100,000 a year (Pounds 69,000). But tax increases are
not restricted to the 'rich' individuals and corporations. Higher taxes on
energy, for example, will fall on virtually all Americans.
Deficit reduction
Meanwhile, spending is to be cut by Dollars 250bn over four years, with some
Dollars 80bn from defence, Dollars 50bn from non-defence discretionary
spending and no less than Dollars 90bn from entitlements. But - mark the
weasel words - spending reductions are to be phased in over time, while
there is to be a Dollars 160bn increase in 'investment'.
The bottom line is a reduction in the federal budget deficit from Dollars
332bn (5 per cent of GDP) in the current fiscal year to Dollars 207bn (2 1/2
per cent of GDP) in 1997. Total deficit reduction is to be some Dollars
500bn over four years, with the deficit in 1997 to be at least Dollars 140bn
below the Congressional Budget Office's forecast for that year. What makes
this reduction in the deficit rather less plausible, however, is the
unnecessary stimulus of Dollars 30bn in the first year. Joy comes first;
pain later.
This plan is plausible only if the president can obtain the tax increases
and the control over spending he wants. Plans for higher taxes will confront
outraged interest groups, perhaps an outraged public. His voters may feel
happy about taxing 'the rich'. They will be less happy about taxes on
themselves. As for spending control, the president may propose, but Congress
disposes.
Right direction
Politically, the plan seems brave. Economically, it still falls short of
what is needed. At present, the US has the lowest national savings rate of
any industrial economy, bar Greece, and a federal deficit that absorbs 30
per cent of private gross savings. A faster rise in the US standard of
living demands a marked increase in its rate of capital formation. For that
the US needs a balanced budget, perhaps even a surplus. Without one, Mr
Clinton will fail to deliver on his promise of a transformed US. The need
for a smaller structural deficit must be still greater when higher taxes
fall heavily on those who save most.
Mr Clinton is in a dilemma. He believes in higher public spending, but he
has also decided, rightly, that the structural budget deficit must be cut.
So he offers less deficit reduction than required, higher taxes than
expected and less additional spending than his supporters desire. Not only
is he bound to make more people unhappy than happy, but much political
capital will be spent on selling a programme that falls short.
The temptation for a Democratic administration that cannot deliver
substantial spending increases through the budget is to deliver them
off-budget, instead. Costs can be loaded on businesses via higher minimum
wages, for example. Costs can also be loaded on consumers, via protection
against imports. Such regulatory changes could have dire long term effects
on US employment and growth.
Though Mr Clinton's budget plan may not be frugal enough. it is broadly in
the right direction. But many and dangerous are the temptations that remain.

the welcome they've been given is now coming home to roost, with worshippers

The 'unpleasant excretory consequences' are a growing problem, the synod was

Anyone puzzling over the true significance of the juggler that forms part of
Transport Development Group's corporate livery might be forgiven for
concluding it had something to do with chief executive Alan Cole's
profligacy with finance directors. He will soon be on his fourth in just
over two years.
First an early retirement, then a promotion, and now a 'mutually agreed'
departure of Paul Kilduff who set foot in TDG only last August . . .
Shareholders can be forgiven for wondering why Cole's finance directors are
coming and going more frequently than the company's annual report and
accounts.
Could it have anything to do with Cole's fancy Harvard Business School
upbringing? 'He does have a tendency to work everything down to a Venn
diagram,' was the assessment of one less than generous City analyst.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As a riposte to newspapers' enthusiasm for publishing performance rankings
of educational establishments, the UK's most pukkah public schools have
turned the tables by producing a ranking of journalists who cover
educational matters.
The counterblast, appearing in the schools' trade magazine Conference and
Common Room, rates the press pundits on five criteria: accuracy, balance,
educational attitudes, delivery and enlightened reporting.
Oddly enough, not all of those named appreciate the results. One, for
example, rebutted the criteria as being too narrow, which, ironically, is a
criticism schools often make of newspaper tables in which they fare poorly.
The Financial Times - which pioneered such rankings in 1970 with its annual
table of university graduates' job-market performance - came in fifth.

The dealing room at Smith New Court has always prided itself on being the
slickest - and the most cut-throat - in the City, rarely giving an inch, let
alone a pound of flesh.
So RSC director David Thacker, toying with the idea of setting the Barbican
Theatre's planned production of The Merchant of Venice in modern dress in
the City, deputed designer Sheelagh Keegan to check it out. Her task was to
see if the Square Mile really is a good substitute for the Rialto.
Even though obviously enthralled as she photographed away with shouting
dealers seething around her, she envisages difficulties in translating the
characters to fit the present-day City.
One problem is how to treat Shylock's Jewishness, although she stresses that
he is by no means an unsympathetic character. 'This is a play about racism,
not antisemitism.' A further misgiving is that she sees him as 'more of a
banker than a dealer'.
On the credit side, the shipowner Antonio could surely be converted into the
man from Lloyd's. What's more, a lot of the ladies who cater for executive
diners nowadays seem to be called Portia (even if they don't necessarily
drive one - Ed.).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nyet a rouble. The Russian government has still had nothing back from its
relationship with America's ace sleuth Jules Kroll, despite 12 months' work
and a Dollars 1m down-payment.
But whose fault is it?
Kroll, hired by Moscow a year ago to hunt millions of dollars spirited out
of the country by the Communist party and tax-shy trading outfits, has found
the tracking task far stonier than his previous forays in recovering the
ill-gotten gains of third world dictators.
He says he hasn't given up hope, blaming the lack of progress on his being
denied any clear line of communication with the Russian authorities.
Moreover, public prosecutor Valentin Stepankov has said that, apart from his
own office, his country has failed to provide the hitherto golden gumshoe
with the feedback he required to continue his searches in the west.
On the other hand, complaints about the usefulness of Kroll's work so far
have been voiced by Mikhail Gurtovoi, who lost his job as head of the
anti-corruption commission with its disbanding last week by President
Yeltsin.
The task has now been handed to the vice-president, Alexander Rutskoi,
backed by continued probing by the president's own government inspectorate.
Even so, Stepankov has been calling for the setting-up of a replacement
commission.
The tangled web surely testifies that, here again, Russia's new authorities
lack the political will and efficient management needed to crack a serious
problem. Nor is solving it made any easier by lousy civil service pay and
enduring state control over most assets.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Personal View: Europe's 'nervous system' out of kilter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN VALLANCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications has become the nervous system of modern society; business
and industry today are increasingly dependent on the instantaneous
transmission of information in all forms. Social life and family life also
rely heavily on the telephone; new technical developments will make these
services even more important for Britain's industrial competitiveness and
quality of life.
Many advanced economies of the world have recognised the need for efficient
technical and service innovation in telecommunications. They see the need
for an environment in which new ideas can be brought to market without
interference from state bureaucracy, public financing policies or defensive
monopoly thinking. But in most of Europe, similar progress has not been
made.
The European Commission has made valiant efforts, culminating in its
Telecommunications Services Directive in 1990, which set out to open up the
market for all services, except public voice telephony. But competition, in
practice, is still rare. No member state, except the UK and, to some degree,
France, has effectively implemented the directive.
This is in stark contrast to the countries which have opted to expose
telecommunications operators to competition and open up their markets to
private sector investment. Britain, the US and Japan have led the way,
followed by Australia, New Zealand and Sweden. The results have been
startlingly successful. Services have proliferated; new market entrants have
multiplied; customers have learned to provide services for themselves and
sell them to others; prices have fallen while the market has grown. Quality
has improved out of all recognition.
In Europe, meanwhile, current Community policy is still that public voice
services (overwhelmingly the most important) and the ownership and running
of network infrastructure are 'reserved' for state-controlled national
monopolies.
Ordinary customers, many ill-served by the local monopolies, have yet to
grasp fully what they are missing. Member states have recognised the needs
of Europe by calling, in the Maastricht treaty, for trans-European networks,
transcending national boundaries and providing Europe with the needed
seamless networks and services. But they are reluctant to face up to the
implications - that private capital and private enterprise, competing right
across the Community, are needed to achieve this end.
Last autumn the European Commission issued a consultative document
suggesting four possible ways forward: to do nothing; to regulate monopolies
far more intensively at the European level, to force them to improve their
performance; opening up of all markets; or, more modestly, opening up just
cross-frontier networks and services.
Many still pray fervently for the first option. No one seriously advocates
the second. The fourth is better than nothing, but it would have widely
differing effects on the markets in member states according to their size
and location and it presents formidable problems of definition and
enforcement.
In fact, the Treaty of Rome has recognised, since 1958, the presumption that
commercial activities should be carried on in a free and open market and the
third course is the obvious way forward.
There is one possible objection: existing operators are required to provide
universal service and incur substantial losses in doing so. Competitors
would exploit the higher prices inevitably required in the unsubsidised part
of the market. But experience in the UK and elsewhere shows that it is quite
possible to deal with this by financial means. The subsidy should be reduced
as far as possible by progressively aligning tariffs to costs. For any
residual subsidy either government should foot the bill or, perhaps more
realistically, new competitors should bear their fair share of the burden.
This is clearly possible; indeed, it has been done (imperfectly, but quite
successfully) both in the UK and in the other liberalised countries of the
world.
In BT's view, the commission should legislate, now, to open up the markets
across the board. The world is moving quickly and action to build on the new
laws will be difficult and take time. Europe is falling behind in its
'nervous system'. Indeed, it may well already be too late.

FT  18 FEB 93 / A battle on the Italian front: Haig Simonian on the
wide-ranging problems facing the new Japanese boss of a European state steel
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Napoleon Bonaparte, the island of Elba represented a brief period of
exile before he moved on to greater glories. For Mr Hayao Nakamura, the
Japanese manager who today takes over as managing director of Italy's Ilva
state steel group, the company could be the stepping stone to a bigger
corporate crown, or the unenviable termination of an impressive career.
Ilva - the Latin name for the iron ore-bearing Mediterranean island - was
supposed to mark a fresh start for the state steel industry after the
collapse of Finsider, the former public-sector steel giant, out of which
Ilva was born in 1988.
Instead of rising from Finsider's ashes, Ilva has staged a remarkable replay
of its demise. It has been trapped in a downward spiral of rising losses and
soaring borrowing, estimated to have reached L8,300bn (Pounds 3.78bn) last
year.
Many of the problems at Ilva, Europe's fourth-biggest steel maker after
Usinor-Sacilor of France, British Steel and Thyssen of Germany, are common
to the industry. Prices in Europe have dropped by about 30 per cent since
1989 as a result of recession and oversupply, notably because of cheap steel
imports from eastern Europe. Last month, the outlook worsened with the
threat of US duties on European steel.
Yesterday, the European Commission proposed a restructuring plan for the
EC's ailing steel makers in return for financial aid of at least Ecu480m
(Pounds 394m) to help cover social costs.
An Ilva spokesman welcomed the Commission's suggestions for action against
what he called 'suspected dumping' of eastern European steel in the EC.
However, he warned that 'capacity cuts by EC producers must be accompanied
by measures to alleviate the social impact of the job losses involved'.
Ilva is likely to remain one of Europe's weakest producers, however. 'It is
in an appalling mess,' says Mr Jonathan Aylen, a lecturer in economics and
steel industry specialist at Britain's Salford University. 'If you take
indicators such as labour productivity, product quality or innovation, Ilva
is very much in the second rank in Europe.'
In 1991, Ilva lost L504bn after minority interests and setting aside L411bn
in extraordinary gains in a special restructuring fund. Recently its
financial decline has become alarming with losses of L1,750bn in the first
11 months of 1992.
Last month, IRI, the Italian state holding company which controls Ilva,
decided to draw the line. Shocked by the deterioration in Ilva's earnings -
IRI had been forecasting a much lower Ilva loss of between L1,000bn and
L1,300bn as recently as early January - it demanded the resignation of the
steel maker's board of directors. The following day, it appointed Mr
Nakamura, a former Nippon Steel executive, to the top job at Ilva.
While the group's problems are symbolic of those facing most European steel
makers, they are also a legacy of Italian state intervention in industry,
where investments and strategic business decisions have been made as much on
political as on commercial grounds.
Under the government of Mr Guiliano Amato, which came to power last summer,
the Italian authorities have demanded that public sector companies improve
their financial performance. The government's sweeping privatisation plan is
vital to lowering Italy's budget deficit, which at L163,150bn last year
equals almost 11 per cent of gross domestic product. Where possible,
profitable state enterprises such as the SME foods group have already been
put up for sale. In the case of acute loss-makers such as Ilva, financial
restructuring and management changes represent the first steps toward
improving earnings and encouraging private investment.
Last month's decision to seek the resignation of Ilva's former board of
directors and choose a foreigner as managing director was an indication of
Mr Amato's determination to minimise the influence of political
considerations in industrial decision-making. Top management changes at
Iritecna, the loss-making state-owned civil engineering and contracting
group, suggests a similar strategy is under way there.
The choice of a foreigner at Ilva was nevertheless unusual; the selection of
a Japanese executive is unprecedented in one of Europe's most protected
markets. But the appointment of Mr Nakamura indicates IRI, struggling to
reduce group debts of nearly L70,000bn, is determined to sort out its
wayward steel subsidiary.
Mr Nakamura has impressive credentials. At 56, he has a solid background in
the steel industry, most recently as Nippon Steel's Italian representative.
Having lived in Italy for almost 30 years, he knows the country and language
well.
He is also one of a handful of Japanese businessmen who understand Italy's
state sector. Mr Nakamura, who takes over today spent time in the 1960s as
the Rome representative of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry. In the 1970s, he worked closely with Finsider on the expansion of
its vast Taranto integrated steel works, still Italy's biggest but now a big
drain on Ilva's resources. Later, he advised on the development of the Novi
Ligure facility.
In spite of his qualifications, observers are asking how Mr Nakamura will
better the performance of his predecessor, Mr Giovanni Gambardella, in
addressing Ilva's problems when most of Europe's steel makers are losing
money.
Mr Gambardella is blamed for many of Ilva's woes. He initiated its L1,500bn
acquisition drive, which expanded its activities from basic steel making
into more value-added and specialised products, such as coated steels for
consumer durables. The strategy, however, drove up debts. Group borrowings
surged from L3,500bn in 1989 to L6,300bn at the end of 1991.
He is also accused of failing to control costs, although such attacks are
harder to sustain in view of his success in closing 15 ex-Finsider plants,
transferred to Ilva after 1988, and selling as many again. In the same
period, the workforce was reduced by 30,000. The cut was 'quite an
achievement', in view of Italy's tough labour laws, admits one IRI
executive.
But with earnings steadily deteriorating, the pace of cost-cutting was not
quick enough, say Mr Gambardella's critics. Last November, IRI gave Ilva's
former management a mid-1993 deadline to prepare a new restructuring plan.
It is up to Mr Nakamura to finish the task.
Speaking in Tokyo this month, Mr Nakamura indicated he would follow two
paths to return Ilva to profit within three years. First, he hinted at
further job cuts, notably at Taranto, and implied he would not seek
consensus with the group's unionised workers at any price.
Second, he hinted he wanted to change attitudes at the steel group. Ilva had
some of the world's most modern plant - much of it built in collaboration
with Nippon Steel - but suffered from weaknesses such as poor quality, bad
marketing and unreliable delivery times. The three had fostered excessive
wastage, inadequate attention to customers and lax financial controls.
Improving such faults would require a greater sense of commitment from the
workforce, he suggested.
Joining the group as a rank outsider may help Mr Nakamura take painful
decisions on further redundancies and closures. 'He has to do for Italian
steel what Ian MacGregor (then chairman) did for British Steel about 10
years ago,' says Mr Aylen, of Salford University. But failing a surprise
upturn in demand, it is hard to see how much extra room for cost-cutting Mr
Nakamura will have.
Mr Nakamura dismissed suggestions that his appointment marked a bridgehead
for Nippon Steel to purchase a stake in Ilva or mount an outright takeover,
although he left the door open for closer technological co-operation.
Above all, he echoed Mr Gambardella in stressing Ilva's need for fresh
capital to reduce borrowings. Last year, Ilva's former bosses openly
discussed gaining a stock market quotation - and access to fresh money  - by
buying out minority shareholders in its Dalmine tubes subsidiary and merging
the two companies.
That may still be on the cards, although the move will depend on first
transferring the bulk of Ilva's debts to a separate company to make it more
attractive to investors. A similar manoeuvre took place on Ilva's birth,
when Finsider was retained as an empty shell containing about two-thirds of
the group's L9,000bn debts.
Just possibly, Mr Nakamura's arrival at Ilva could persuade outside
investors that the company has the potential to be an interesting recovery
stock. Contacts with foreign bankers had already taken place under the
previous management. But before outsiders offer to help, the group will
first have to show it is willing to tackle its problems fast and
effectively.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Letter: Road tolls - financial penalty and social costs
understated (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr IAN SMITH and Dr FELIX FITZROY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Tomkins correctly argues for the inclusion of accident and
environmental costs of road transport in a cost-benefit analysis of
motoring. However, his case is weakened by the use of estimates for the
social costs which are far too low, namely Pounds 6.1bn for accidents and
Pounds 1.7bn for the environment. The Umwelt und Prognose Institute in
Heidelberg has published careful estimates for external costs in West
Germany in 1989 which are roughly comparable to the current UK situation.
They calculate total accident costs at about DM70bn and all external costs
of road traffic at DM250bn, equivalent to 12 per cent of German national
income. Even allowing for higher traffic density and accident rates in
former West Germany, the corresponding UK figure should be at least six
times that quoted by Tomkins.
Urban congestion can be most effectively reduced by improving public
transport with priority lanes and restricting car access, as in Zurich and
other Continental cities. The general problem is most effectively dealt with
by higher fuel taxes rather than cumbersome new road taxes.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Letter: Road tolls - financial penalty and social costs
understated (1)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH FAIRCLOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Tomkins makes an excellent try at balancing the pros and cons
of motorway tolls, ('For whom the road tolls', February 13).
However, suggesting that motorists might be paying Pounds 3.9bn less than
motoring's true price, thanks to the 'cost of capital' element of Pounds
7.2bn, ignores the financial penalty that we would face if no motorway
network had been built. The Confederation of British Industry puts the cost
of congestion at Pounds 15bn (at 1988 prices). Without motorways, delays
would be taking an economically crippling toll. Therefore the capital
element has no legitimate place in the balance sheet, leaving UK motorists
more than Pounds 3bn in credit.
The key question is, will the Treasury allow us to have a motorway network
to meet our economic and social needs? The answer is that it will not, and
direct charging for the use of motorways appears likely.
The AA opposes motorway charging unless (a) all income raised from motorway
charging is used for improvement, maintenance and management of the motorway
network; and (b) motorway charges must be matched by a corresponding
reduction in motoring taxation.
For Britain's road-based economy the government's total spend on roads is
Pounds 5.5bn against a tax take from motorists of Pounds 14.7bn (excluding
VAT). British motorists won't give the government a blank cheque, but they
will demand that their money is used to provide a quality road system.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Letter: Not a sterling response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Why is it that every person I speak to overseas asks me why the British
are not taking advantage of cheaper sterling to boost exports? My answer is
that they are using cheaper sterling to widen their margins rather than
increase sales. Meanwhile, the Japanese and the Germans are gaining market
share. 'Not very clever', as someone said recently in Johannesburg.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Letter: Wrong angle on short-term disturbance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GERALD PARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your odd-angled, close-up photograph of machinery (February 15, page 7)
is about as fair and sensible an illustration of 'unsightly opencast mining'
as a below-the-rim photograph of an unflushed lavatory would demonstrate the
poor quality of bathroom decor and design.
The serious environmental problems of deep mining should not be ignored.
These include the disposal of colliery spoil, subsidence, and the need for
high-level equipment. By contrast, the comparatively short-term disturbance
arising from opencasting is followed by restoration which often recreates
landscapes that have disappeared as a result of long-term agriculture.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Worst of friends: Foreign critics of Clinton have been
unfair, argues Jurek Martin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a jumpiness about America's friends and allies in the early days of
the Clinton administration that has been widely noted. It needs to be held
in check.
The European Community, Britain and Japan have all been guilty of excess
nervousness above and beyond that which is normal when the US acquires a new
government. That the US is now the world's only superpower is not an excuse.
Narrowing the general to the particular, those accused include Sir Leon
Brittan, the EC commissioner, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, and unnamed Japanese 'officials'. Excluded from the charge sheet,
however, is Lord David Owen, the EC's Balkan negotiator, for reasons that
will be explained later.
The evidence is as follows: last week, at his 'town meeting' in Detroit,
President Bill Clinton was asked by a questioner from Seattle, where Boeing
is the number one employer, what needed to be done about lay-offs in the US
aerospace industry.
He replied, probably for the 73rd time, that one of the competitive problems
facing the US industry was subsidised foreign competition, viz Airbus
Industrie. In the opinion of the EC and Sir Leon, he thus overlooked the
fact that the US and the Community had temporarily buried the hatchet on
Airbus subsidies last year.
That agreement may well be the equivalent of the Magna Carta in European
bureaucratic and industrial eyes, but it is doubtful that it has entered Mr
Clinton's consciousness yet. It is, therefore, ridiculous to assume that he
was making policy on the hoof, which seems to have been the reflex reaction
in European capitals last Friday.
This was not Sir Leon's first offence. He had leapt all over the Clinton
administration, accusing it of 'unilateral bullying', when the steel dumping
rulings were announced in the first week of the new US government. He may
have done so for tactical reasons, but he also did so in the certain
knowledge that this was a process, unfair as it may be, set in train under
President Bush and, regardless of the occupant of the White House,
unalterable under US procedures.
Mr Hurd, by reputation so cool, calm and collected, also has charges to
answer. He knew perfectly well, because the British embassy in Washington
had told him so, that there was nothing sinister in Mr Warren Christopher's
comments a while back about the composition of the UN Security Council. The
secretary of state had been asked, at his own 'town meeting' with his new
staff, if it was not the case that the Security Council's composition should
reflect the global power structure of today and not that of 1945 when it was
established. He replied that of course it should reflect contemporary
realities, but, in hedging his answer with many qualifications, he did not
leave the impression that he wanted Britain kicked off it.
Mr Hurd, however, needlessly rose to the British tabloid bait, huffing and
puffing about the importance of British membership, after a perhaps
gratuitous reference to US financial arrears to the UN.
It is hard to keep track of the Japanese egregiousness in a fistful of
mostly anonymous Tokyo briefings questioning US trade policy. This is a
legitimate concern though mostly derived from reading what once liberated
academics such as Laura Tyson have written over the years and which
conveniently forgets that few heads of the Council of Economic Advisers,
which she now is, have exercised real policy clout in living memory.
More than that, these same sources have been questioning the moral fibre of
American society. There are reasons for such questions, especially when
Japanese visitors to the US have suffered violent physical attacks. But the
extrapolation of specific incidents into a general decay takes a little
stomaching on this side of the Pacific, where people are aware not only of
Japan's trade practices but also of its unwillingness to sully itself by
taking more than the bare minimum of the 18m refugees now littered around
the world.
Lord Owen, whose excoriation of the presumed US policies towards Bosnia
were, until last week, conspicuous, at least had both legitimate grievances
(lack of consultation by the new administration and the blackening of the
reputation of his negotiating partner, Cyrus Vance) and an immediate
purpose. This was to try and dissuade Washington from rearming the Bosnian
Moslems, which, he was convinced, would have scuppered the Vance-Owen peace
process.
He played his thin deck of cards for all it was worth, not only with the
administration, with success, but also, exquisitely if with mixed results,
with the pundits of The New York Times.
But the combination of all the above, excepting Lord Owen, guilty only of
typically bad manners, has not exactly been to make friends and influence
people in Washington. America's friends and allies have seemed petulant and
self-serving rather than recognising reality - which is that they need the
new US administration as much as, if not more than, at any time since the
reconstruction after the last world war.
What should be borne in mind is that, for the first time in 12 years, the US
has a government from a different party. Its instincts, its priorities and
its value judgments may well be some miles removed from its immediate
predecessors, especially from President Bush, schooled almost exclusively in
the clubby and cold war-dominated world of international affairs still
inhabited by so many western leaders.
Europe, the UK and Japan have to learn that this administration may take its
time to make up its mind on policy issues and that, to paraphrase LBJ on J
Edgar Hoover, it is better to be on the inside of the tent urinating out
than vice versa. Given the fractured state of Europe and Japan's
uncertainty, the only nation currently capable of putting up the tent is the
US. And if Mr Clinton is too polite or too canny to say so, then there are a
lot of Americans with influence who are not. Just for starters, most
consider Bosnia to be 'a European war'.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Letter: French compounding exchange rate problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICK PARSONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan sets out concisely the balance of opposing forces on the
French Franc/D-Mark exchange rate ('Modest repairs to ERM 'fault lines'',
February 15). Rather than a European Monetary Institute, or council of
so-called 'wise men' though, a mechanism already exists for spotting
currency misalignments and making necessary adjustments. It is the Dollars
300bn a day foreign exchange market.
No EC country can be immune from the dramatic economic slowdown in Germany
but France's rigid adherence to the ERM and the interest rates necessary to
prevent speculation in the foreign exchange market are making a bad
situation worse in the short term. The interest rates set by the Bundesbank
may or may not be appropriate for Germany but it is hard to imagine they are
appropriate for France at the moment.
What have the authorities to fear from a floating franc? If they believe
their own rhetoric about fundamentals, the currency may even appreciate on
interest rate cuts designed to stimulate economic growth. The way to find
out is to float openly or to set such wide fluctuation bands that the
exchange rate is not a policy constraint.
Mr Brittan suggests that the searching for correct exchange rates 'is like
looking in a dark room for a black cat which is not there'. The French view
of European monetary union compounds this problem by keeping the cat to
guard against a German mouse which is not there either.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Letter: A flawed capital rules strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof STEPHEN M SCHAEFER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, News that the International Organisation of Securities Commissions
(Iosco) has decided to abandon its attempts to devise a set of rules
governing minimum capital requirements ('Iosco drops common capital rules
plan', February 11) should be welcomed by all those who regard the
prudential regulation of securities companies as an important matter.
The Iosco proposals were flawed in at least two important respects. First,
under the banner of 'level playing fields' they sought to impose rules which
completely failed to take into account the substantial differences in
structure which exist between different securities markets.
Second, the rules would have forced companies to look at risk in ways which
were 40 years out of date and inconsistent with best practice in leading
financial institutions.
It is inevitable that at some stage the question of harmonisation will
re-emerge on the agenda of international regulation. When it does, let us
hope that political problems in reaching consensus do not, as on this
occasion, lead to second-rate solutions to an important regulatory problem.

The most useful thing I can do as British unemployment once more rises to 3m
is to summarise the main features of the problem as I see them.
The immediate reason for the jobless explosion is the severity of the
recession and the slow recovery from it.
That in turn reflects the severe collapse of property prices, which has made
both individuals and companies more anxious to repay debt than to take on
new commitments. It has also made the banks, whose own balance sheets have
been hit, ultra-cautious about new lending.
There may also be a further feedback from unemployment itself. A Barclays
Bank survey suggests that 40 per cent of the adult population and 50 per
cent of those at work are more hesitant about borrowing because of the fear
of job loss. Businessmen who say that the recession is not the only factor
are correct. But they often mistake what the fundamentals really are.
For instance, Mr Percy Barnvik, the president of the ABB, the world's
largest power engineering group, told the Financial Times (Jan 4) that
inexorable advances in productivity were leading to large-scale permanent
unemployment.
This is the most frequently recurring scare in world economic history and is
sometimes dignified by the name 'lump of labour fallacy'. It is based on the
idea that total output is fixed, so that if fewer workers are needed in one
line of activity they must end up on the scrap-heap.
This fallacious diagnosis leads to fallacious remedies, mainly designed to
reduce the labour supply, such as emigration, compulsory reduction of
working hours, early retirement, and so on. It was embraced in the 17th
century by James I of England, otherwise known as the 'wisest fool in
Christendom', who wanted to carry off the unemployed to Virginia and
Newfoundland.
What such practical men fail to see is that unemployment is a market
relationship, but one of some complexity.
The most widely understood aspect is that between unemployment and
inflation. There is indeed no long-term trade-off between the two.
Employment is not higher in Latin America countries prone to double-digit
inflation or in the former Soviet Union than it is in sound money countries.
But it is true, that the move from a high rate of inflation to a lower one
involves a temporary rise in unemployment, as the UK saw in the early 1980s
and again in the early 1990s. Similarly an inflationary upturn is often
accompanied by a temporary reduction of unemployment to abnormally low
levels, as in the late 1980s.
The approach via inflation does not however explain why the number of people
out of work should now be so high over the average of the business cycle. UK
unemployment exceeded 3m in the aftermath of the last recession. But the
drop to below 1.7m in 1990 proved an unsustainable after-effect of the
previous boom. It looks as if the equilibrium rate of unemployment cannot be
very far from 2.5m.
We need to move back a step. Just as there is a relationship that goes from
unemployment to nominal pay (that is pay in money terms) there is another
relationship that goes from real pay to unemployment. The higher the level
of real pay per head, the smaller the number of workers likely to be offered
jobs.
At a common-sense level the relation is simple enough. The more that
anything costs, the less of it will be bought. But it is difficult to
demonstrate statistically in the national labour market, with so much else
going on in the economy at the same time.
There is the statistical problem of which measure of real pay best
represents employers' costs. The more basic problem is that the true cost of
employing labour depends on the margin above labour and other costs that a
business can get away with imposing, which is difficult to explain without a
good model of how the whole economy works. Such models are not easy to come
by.
The Treasury did have a shot at the subject in 1985 under a chancellor,
Nigel Lawson, who was not afraid to talk about the link between pay and
jobs. Its paper, The Relationship between Pay and Jobs, estimated that a
change of 1 per cent in real wages would ultimately be associated with a
change the other way of 110,000 to 220,000 jobs, an estimate still often
cited.
Emphasis on the word 'real' may help to explain why pay can still be a
problem, even when earnings increases are, at 5 per cent a year, the lowest
for several decades. But so too is inflation, down to 1 1/2 to 3 per cent,
according to the measure used. Real pay per head is thus rising by 2 to 3
per cent. By contrast, Professor James Meade remarks in a fascinating
memorandum to Labour's Borrie Commission (contactable via IPPR at 071 379
7400) that 'to absorb 2m extra workers into employment would require a
considerable reduction in real wage costs, involving an absolute fall in the
real wage rates, in order to induce employers in a free enterprise economy
to expand their output sufficiently'.
The level of benefits clearly affects the wage which workers are willing to
accept. But of course real pay is not the only non-cyclical influence on the
jobs market. Levels of education and training, international and
technological developments and real interest rates all play a role.
But in most markets price - in this case pay - is the final equilibrating
mechanism between supply and demand after all other influences have been
taken into account; and in the labour market it reacts sluggishly and
incompletely.
One reason for the difficulties economists have in tracing the pay-jobs
relation is that they look too much at national averages and not enough at
pay for specific skills and categories of workers, where market-clearing
differentials have widened out in recent years. In an Economic Viewpoint of
January 14, I summarised how the US has had a better jobs record than
Europe, but at the expense of driving down real pay for the less skilled.
There are also cultural and moral influences which economists do not much
like discussing. Indeed, it is often the most enlightened businessmen who
are most resistant to any talk of a link between pay and jobs and who boast
of their small but well-paid labour forces.
They have indeed good reason to be worried, even if their own actions are
not as helpful as they think. For driving down real wages to market-clearing
levels could have morally unacceptable effects on the distribution of
income, unless low rates of pay are supplemented by some other means.
Prof Meade's main interest is in moving from a conventional welfare state to
a modest citizen's income available to all. But similar reasoning applies to
workfare, special employment measures and all the other palliatives. They
are all basically ways of employing people without making employers pay the
full going rate. One of the best analyses I have seen is that of RS Musgrave
(Workfare, 24 Garden Avenue, Samwellgate Moor, Durham, DH1 5EQ). As he says,
in a totally free market the unemployed have the choice of doing nothing, or
doing a job other than their usual one for a while. Governments have usually
subsidised only the choice of doing nothing.
Nevertheless there is no reason why job subsidies should be confined to the
public sector or to special projects of any kind. Whatever is valuable in
the workfare idea can be achieved by marginal employment subsidies to normal
employers on a temporary and a limited basis.
Of course these measures are putting sticking plaster on the problem and it
will be quite a while, if ever, before the labour market can be
fundamentally reformed. It was a political mistake for the Thatcher and
Major governments to wind down their special employment programmes on the
back of a temporary economic upturn which could not be expected to resolve
the underlying jobs problem.

Wandsworth is regarded as one of the toughest prisons in the UK but it has
opened its doors to director Roger Graef and his camera team to record
Turning the Screws, which begins a three part series on Channel 4 at 9pm.
Graef's earlier investigation on the workings of the police force 10 years
ago made such an impact that the approach to interviewing rape victims was
changed. This time he examines life in prison from the point of view of the
staff rather than the convicts, and arrives at Wandsworth just as a dispute
is brewing about operating practices between a liberal governor and the
Prison Officers Association.
After successfully going their separate ways in TV comedy sitcoms, French
and Saunders combine their talents again after a three-year break on BBC 2
at 9pm. The first show seems to be based around that easy formula, the
lampooning of popular movies, including Silence of the Lambs and In Bed with
Madonna.
That is preceded by yet another series about skiing, with Muriel Gray as the
presenter and the return of Top Gear, which concerns the launch of Ford's
replacement for the Sierra, the Mondeo.

THE BAD LIEUTENANT (18) Abel Ferrara
A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (PG) Robert Redford
THE LAST DAYS OF CHEZ NOUS (15) Gillian Armstrong
MEAN STREETS (18) Martin Scorsese
'No one can kill me. I'm blessed. I'm a Catholic,' says detective Harvey
Keitel in Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant. In Sleeper Woody Allen,
masquerading as a surgeon in the year two-thousand-and-something, was called
on to reconstruct a human being from a single disembodied nose. Many of us
could imaginatively reconstruct the rest of Ferrara's film from that single
line of dialogue.
This is the one about the bad, possibly mad, certainly dangerous cop. Harvey
Keitel's lieutenant, a corruption-prone veteran of the New York Police, is
so bent that you could use him to arrest people around corners. His
specialities are violent crime, drugs and sexual offences. In order to stop
himself enjoying all three, he must keep invoking his Catholic beliefs.
Assailed by bleeding visions of Christ, he knows that redemption is possible
if he can only get his moral act together.
Violence is 'in' today. See Reservoir Dogs, Man Bites Dog and other films
with or without canine titles. So the small handful of once-panned movies in
writer-director Ferrara's filmography, from Driller Killer to King Of New
York, have lately been undergoing revision as masterworks of gutter realism.
Result: the flattered Ferrara catches the biggest dose of pretension since
De Palma made The Bonfire Of The Vanities. After the cynical, crackling
promise of early scenes - Keitel snaffling drugs from crime-scene cars,
Keitel pocketing a convenience-store robber's loot, Keitel forcing a
'freebie' from two ladies of the night - God gets his call to the set.
The violent rape of a nun on a church altar by two hoodlums - no
sensationalist possibility omitted there, I think - first gets our hero
thinking about redemption. Putting his knitted brows and musclebound stoop
into action, Keitel keeps shambling back to the church where the crime was
committed. Here he first sees a vision of Jesus complete with bleeding head
and nimbus of light. Then he re-encounters the abused nun, Sister Plot
Device, who counsels him to forgive rather than to avenge.
If you imagine Mickey Spillane adapting Graham Greene's The Power And The
Glory for Michael Winner, you might have an idea of the battle raging here
between holiness and hokum. All stops are out visually and viscerally. But
one finally concludes that the reason Ferrara rubs our noses in depravity -
real needles entering real arms, realistic blood showering real walls or
windows - is that if he allowed us once to stand back and see the panoramic
for the particular we might rumble the movie's idiot self-importance.
Idea for thesis: artist's trichological condition as trigger to his creative
style. In A River Runs Through It America is seen by director Robert Redford
as if through the golden cascades of his own hair. We are ushered into the
story by RR's voice-over, purring gilded sentences from the homonymous
boyhood memoir by Norman MacLean. Then, in the feature-length flashback that
is the film, young Redford lookalike Brad Pitt takes over as one of the
tale's two brothers, sparring for self-fulfilment with each other and with
pastor father Tom Skerritt.
Actually - just for confusion - the un-Redfordish Craig Sheffer, who
resembles John Malkovich with hair, plays the putative young Redford, based
on the young MacLean. Pitt is his handsome sibling Paul, hellraising in
early-century Montana and making Pa Skerritt so goshdarn angry. (Watch that
milk jug as you thump the table, Pop.) For while Norman is college-bound and
chastely enamoured of Britain's Emily Lloyd (plus American accent), Paul is
deep in whores, whisky and poker debts.
We have seen this story before, have we not? About - I take a guess - 100
times. But here there is a novel metaphor. The scenes of fly-fishing in the
sparkling, russet-banked rivers are given a real lyricism by Redford and his
cameraman Philippe Rousselot (The Emerald Forest). Long fishing-lines arc
and curl in sun-caught silver; Coplandish music by Mark Isham warbles on the
soundtrack; and even the hardest heart melts a little at this shrewdly
gorgeous image of an American Dream woven from man-made discipline and
close-to-nature freedom.
For while the scenery fills the brothers' spiritual lungs, Dad sharpens
their mental mettle by teaching them the 'Presbyterian way' to cast a line.
This involves metronomes and much mind-over-matter. Brief filial revolts are
inevitable - like Paul taking Norm off on a rapids-shooting trip - but soon
the the boys will surely thank and respect Dad and even grow up to write
about him.
The lectures never quite crush the life out of the lyricism. Even when
wondering 'Is Norman MacLean an outdoor version of Norman Rockwell?', we
glow as the images glide past in this river trip through a never-never
America. And when the sun goes down each day and we traipse indoors for the
movie's lecture sessions - yes, the heart and mind, animus and anima must
rule equally - we know it is only until morning that director-producer
Redford has pushed his hair back under his mortar-board.
Idea for another thesis: The Euro-actor as today's equivalent of the
Wandering Jew. Germany's Bruno Ganz seems no clearer about what he is doing
in Australia in Gillian Armstrong's The Last Days Of Chez Nous than he was
about being in England in David Hare's Strapless or in America in The Boys
From Brazil.
Let me supply the answer. He is the soul of Western art and civilisation. In
Armstrong's tale of Bohemian lives among a group of Aussie fortysomethings,
Ganz alternates meal-table tantrums ('For two years I have been looking for
zese cheeses]' when someone takes a bite from his precious Brie) with
burgeoning romantic disenchantment ('Do you think we'll ever make love
again?' mourns girlfriend Lisa Harrow).
He is adrift, as is the audience, in a world where the affirmative hedonism
of the 1960s has turned to live-and-make-do. Gillian Armstrong made the
famous, overrated My Brilliant Career. Here she goes for another
pin-down-the-zeitgeist tale; but a film about formlessness is harder to do
than one about formativeness. As the characters yatter around the
sempiternal kitchens and Late Flower-Power sitting rooms - also present are
Harrow's pubescent daughter (Miranda Otto) and pregnant half-sister (Kerry
Fox) - we feel as if we are at the wrong party, pressed to the wall by
yesterday's people shrilly insisting they are today's.
Mean Streets, which 20 years ago marked Martin Scorsese's breakthrough as a
feature film director, is yesterday's movie but still of today. Vivid,
visionary, sardonic: everything that Bad Lieutenant tries to be but fails.
It even has the same star, Harvey Keitel, here fresher in his mannerisms as
the Mafia 'collector' who moves through the bars of Little Italy as if
through the ante-chambers of Hell. Also present: Robert De Niro in his
starmaking role as Keitel's victim pal, a human jack-in-the-box who jumps
out through the screen the more the plot pushes him down.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Arts: Maxwell Davies's double bass concerto - London
concerts on the South Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Maxwell Davies's set of Strathclyde Concertos for the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra, planned to be ten in number, is moving toward completion. (The
series-name does honour to the enlightened action of the Strathclyde
Regional Council in commissioning them.) Each one features a different
instrumental soloist or concertante combination. Number seven - given its
first London outing on Tuesday, at the Queen Elizabeth Hall - is for the
double bass, and is perhaps the most fascinating yet.
In these works a Maxwell Davies has been revealed quite different from the
adventurer of youth, the confronter of angular, sometimes violently dramatic
music-theatre conceptions. His musical mode here is a subtly woven web of
discourse in which purely musical ideas - about the characterisation of solo
instrumental voices, the relationship of individual and group strands, the
movement forward of sonata-style argument - are examined and developed.
Maxwell Davies has set out in each case to fulfil his proposition as
fluently, and as 'continuously', as Bach or Haydn might have done. (It is
probably for this reason that the concertos have already received some
rather testy dismissals from former Maxwell Davies admirers.)
The proposition, in this seventh concerto, is that the double bass should be
treated not as a vehicle for rhythm, or weird animal-imitation effects, or
lumbering comedy, but as a lyrical voice in its own right. The gently
meditative opening, in which the that voice is musingly tested, with bare
support from other low strings, is masterly. The particularly Klang of the
concerto, at once warm, rather lean and full of internal variety, is
achieved with a sobriety that can nevertheless run to quietly astonishing
virtuoso effects of textural contrast.
On a first hearing I also admired the self-effacingly expert way the work is
moved forward, via gradually unfolding melodic devices and disgorging of
consonant-sounding harmonies. The sheer functional intelligence of the music
is disguised, as it should be, by all its many civilised surface qualities.
The performance, by Duncan McTier and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra under
the composer's baton, was excellently run-in. Not surprising: the concert -
which also billed works by Edward Harper and Judith Weir and the (rather
garish) first concert suite from Maxwell Davies's ballet score Caroline
Mathilde - had been given in five British cities previously, as part of the
latest Contemporary Music Network Tour.
Final SCO performances this weekend, in Sheffield, Bath and Northampton

FT  18 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Fantastic' without fantasy - London concerts on the
South Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the end of a piece, the conductor Zubin Mehta likes to swing straight
round to the audience even while the last chord resounds, with uplifted arms
that mean something like 'Hey, WOW]] - yeah?' (We have to remember his 13
years with the New York Philharmonic.) He did it after his Berlioz Symphonie
fantastique with the London Philharmonic at the Royal Festival Hall on
Tuesday, and drew an instant 'Bravo]' from a voice in the usual place: rear
right in the Terrace.
Though there was some modest justification for that, there had been none
earlier, at the close of the same composer's Beatrice and Benedict overture.
The 'caprice written with the point of a needle', as Berlioz put it himself,
was remarkable chiefly for the cautious tempo Mehta chose for the main
material (almost unaccented, certainly without any glint of embattled wit)
and the leaden glumness of the 'romantic' episodes. If one wanted to have
Berlioz condemned to programme-filler status, a performance like this would
reinforce the cause.
The 'Fantastic' was better, but only by a few public degrees. Mehta
engineered a thoroughly professional reading. There were stage-explosions in
the right places, and they were properly led up to by purposeful
developments - extrovert, candid, muscular. At the subcutaneous level,
nothing happened at all. Berlioz's most original strengths can be detected
only beyond the literal notes; here, hardly anything of his tremulous
confessional vein, his sudden catches of breath or his abrupt violence made
itself felt - just bold colours and professional energy. Not at all bad, but
not very good: the visionary aspect of the score was reduced to newsprint
photos.
In Bartok's 2nd Piano Concerto there were more penetrating flashes, thanks
entirely to Andras Schiff's account of the solo part. They were mostly
confined to the lyrical piano intermezzi, however, on which he lavished
quirkily elegant insights. In the rougher music Schiff's lack of percussive
conviction, of forceful rhetoric, left him an easy prey to the devouring
orchestra.
In fact the LPO sounded raw, much less well rehearsed than for the
'Fantastic'. For the central Adagio the hazy, muted strings and timpani were
evocative enough, but in the bright outer movements the whole band never
achieved the leanness and tautness that the music demands. I had to put on
the Philips recording, by Zoltan Kocsis and Ivan Fischer with the Budapest
Festival Orchestra, to remind myself how much more is invested in Bartok's
score.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Arts: Luisa Miller - Opera in Geneva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a tenor is on form, it is the tenor's opera - even when it is named
after the soprano. This was the case with Neil Shicoff's performance in
Luisa Miller at the Grand Theatre, Geneva (broadcast live by Radio 3 on
Saturday evening).
Verdi could have written the part of Rodolfo for Shicoff. He may not fit the
conventional picture of a romantic suitor: the neurotic expression, bookish
spectacles and delicate build conjure visions of an operatic Woody Allen
rather than the squire's son who falls hopelessly in love with a village
girl. But he still looks youthful enough for the part. The key, of course,
is the voice: Shicoff remains the focus of attention simply through the
emotive power of his singing.
The American tenor's trademark is his tragic, tearful vocal timbre. He does
not overwork it, and despite the Italianate ardour of his delivery, he never
resorts to the sobs, scoops and other mannerisms that all too many Italian
tenors equate with feeling. Nor does he force the tone. On a good night like
this, he hits the notes accurately, fearlessly, musically. He also gives you
the impression that he is totally committed to the part, rather than sailing
through it en route to the next celebrity concert.
Where Shicoff appealed to the heart, the German film director Werner
Schroeter succeeded in making Verdi's first bourgeois drama appeal to the
head. Schroeter's staging, designed by Alberte Barsacq and first seen last
season in Amsterdam, uses period costumes, but otherwise dispenses with the
customary anecdotal trappings. In their place is a permanent multi-level
construction of platforms and staircases, a metaphor of the complexity and
claustrophobia of Tyrolean village life. The chorus watches from
side-galleries as the emotions of the principals are systematically laid
bare. The result may strike some as clinical, and until the final scene the
characters remain stereotypes; but the story is intelligently told, the
music never crowded out.
That meant ample opportunity to appreciate the style and sparkle of the
accompaniments under Carlo Rizzi, who lifted the responses of the Geneva
orchestra and chorus a good notch or two above normal. Kallen Esperian's
rapturous Luisa was more successful in the lyrical outpourings of the second
part of the evening than the coloratura of the first. Paul Plishka, in fine
voice, captured the domineering selfishness of Count Walter. Even more
impressive was the crisp, penetrating delivery of the Polish bass Romuald
Tesarowicz, whose Wurm recalled Obadiah Slope in the Barchester Chronicles:
beneath the oily hauteur lies a scorpion. Antonio Salvadori, replacing
Thomas Allen, was a workmanlike Miller.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Technology: Dress sense in Antarctica
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trudging to work in February may present as much of a challenge as many of
us ever want in finding suitably warm clothing. But for Sir Ranulph Fiennes
and Michael Stroud, who have just completed a record-breaking crossing of
the Antarctic, suitable clothing required more than just comfort.
'When you're walking across the Antarctic comfort becomes less important
than performance,' points out Les Jacques, textile centre manager for ICI
Fibres. 'It's a question of life or death.'
The performance requirements of polar explorers are peculiar. 'They don't
carry a single waterproof item,' explains Oliver Shephard, who accompanied
Sir Ranulph on many of his explorations. In the South Pole it simply does
not rain.
Nor, for the most part of the day, do the explorers require very warm
clothing. 'Pulling a 450lb sledge you get mighty warm,' Shephard points out.
Instead the main requirement on a continent where winds can reach speeds of
up to 200mph are for clothes that are windproof, and 'breathable' - so that
perspiration is not held against the skin. If that does happen the moisture
can freeze when the garment is removed. That can be life-threatening, as the
human body loses heat six to eight times more quickly when the skin is
moist, burning up calories.
All the fabrics worn by the explorers were man-made. They included
specialist 'breathable' underwear, topped by thick, wind-proof trousers and
a shirt. Thick jackets, resembling duvets, would be put on each morning.
Once the men became warmer the thick jackets would be swapped for lighter,
windproof outer clothing.
Socks and gloves are made of specially treated fibres to ensure no sweat is
retained next to the skin.
The technology to produce fabrics incorporating 'moisture management', as it
is known, has been pioneered in the sports and ski-wear industry. Aerobic
outfits, for example, can be lined with a coating, such as ICI's Tactel, to
take the moisture away from the skin and prevent post-exercise chill.
Gore-Tex has proven particularly popular as a fabric coating to protect from
wind and rain, for mountaineering equipment or ski-wear. Other coatings are
being developed: these days some garments are even coated with Teflon, more
popularly used on non-stick saucepans.
'It is very easy to make things which are waterproof, windproof or
breathable,' says Andrew Geere, marketing manager of Berghaus, which makes
mountaineering and other outdoor equipment. 'It's getting all three into a
fibre which is very difficult.'
Given the effectiveness of the latest high-technology fabrics it is perhaps
surprising that recent expeditions have still favoured the duck-down
sleeping bed as the favoured form of night-time insulation. And Shephard is
rueful that pressure from animal rights groups means explorers can no longer
wear animal skins. Wolf-skins, he points out, are far more effective than
their synthetic imitators. 'If it keeps the wolf warm just think what it
does for you.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / Technology: A clear view for contacts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Contact lenses, which float in the eye's tear fluid, are for those who want
improved vision and prefer the inconvenience of taking them in and out - and
the risk of losing them - to the inconvenience of wearing glasses. Their use
became possible this century with the development of modern plastics,
whereas spectacles have been around since the Middle Ages.
But the idea of a lens fitting straight over the eye has been around for a
long time. Leonardo da Vinci drew a design for such a device in the 15th
century. Four hundred years later, the first contact lens appeared. It was
made of glass and covered most of the eye.
Today's lenses parallel some of the developments in spectacles - such as the
availability of tints and application to presbyopes as well as to people
with congenital sight defects - but they also have to overcome difficulties
of their own.
The first contacts were hard and not always easy to wear. But the rapid
development of soft and disposable lenses, with a high water content, has
decreased the hard products' market share. Because they sit on the eye,
contact lenses are prone to deterioration and protein build-up.
Today's hard lenses are gas permeable, allowing eyes to breathe. In the view
of Gary Mulloy, chief executive of California-based Pilkington Barnes-Hind,
part of Pilkington of the UK, manufacturers need to be more innovative,
especially in catering for presbyopes.
Companies do have products for these users. Essilor's Lunelle division has
brought out Variations, which it says is the first progressive soft lens for
presbyopes; it contains 78 per cent water. But Mulloy sees prospects for
further design and materials innovations in this area, as well as to bring
back customers who found contacts awkward to use. 'Drop-outs have been a
major problem.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / Technology: Sights set on wider horizons - Wearers of
spectacles and contact lenses want to look good as well as see better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One day, the chances are that if you are not a myope or a hyperope, you will
become a presbyope. You may have done so already.
There is nothing to worry about; the terms do not denote weird changes of
appearance or behaviour. They define the main types of eyesight problem
which require people to wear spectacles or contact lenses, either from
childhood or, somewhat disconcertingly for those born with perfect vision,
from the onset of their 40s.
Almost everybody needs lenses at some stage of their life - spectacles have
a bigger slice of the market than contacts - and companies are striving to
bring out new products that combine improved optical quality with greater
elegance. These include new thinner and lighter plastics, special coatings
and tints, and the blending of varying optical strengths on the same lens to
eliminate the bifocal effect.
Essilor, the French company which leads the world spectacle lens market,
reckons that (excluding the statistically opaque eastern European region and
China) one in five people wears a corrective lens. This means 700m pairs of
lens-covered eyes.
In the western industrialised countries, the proportion is much higher: some
60 per cent of people in North America have lenses, as do 40 per cent in
western Europe, and 41 per cent in Japan. Half the lenses are sold to
presbyopes - the greying over-40s who find that a hardening of the eye's
crystalline lens makes it harder to focus sharply.
With a higher proportion of older people in the populations of developed
countries as the post-war 'baby boom' generation ages, the demand for lenses
to correct presbyopia will obviously rise sharply. More than 90 per cent of
those aged 45 and over in the US wear lenses, and over 70 per cent in other
industrialised countries.
'The presbyopic is the fastest growing market,' says Jacky Fremont, head of
Essilor's UK operation. The other common types of lens wearer for which
companies cater are myopes, who can see well at short distances but poorly
from afar, and hyperopes, with the opposite problem. In western Europe,
there are nearly 60m myopes (including 5m in the UK alone) and more than 35m
hyperopes (4m in the UK).
Whatever their vision problem and however serious it may be, most people do
not just want to see better through their lenses. They also want to look
better while wearing them. Much of the fashion effort goes into producing
more elegant, colourful and stylish frames. But the appearance of the lens
is also important, especially for those whose sight is bad enough to warrant
a thick prescription lens.
By far the biggest share of the spectacle lens market is accounted for by
plastic, which is much lighter than glass. The original CR39 polymer resin,
developed in the US and first used by Essilor in the 1950s, is about half
the weight of glass. It is shockproof and accepts artificial tints better
than glass.
But it is also about 30 per cent thicker than glass and less
scratch-resistant. Much of the optical companies' recent work, therefore,
has been on thinner and lighter lenses from more advanced resins. This
development began in Japan, where there is a high level of myopia and thus a
greater degree of sensitivity to the wearing of very thick lenses.
The California-based Sola Group expects the thin, light end of the market to
grow at about 20 per cent annually in the next few years. Its new
Spectralite lenses are made of tough, versatile plastic material and have
aspheric designs which make them flatter than spherical lenses. These
compete with Essilor's Ormex lenses, which are up to 55 per cent lighter
than glass and 30 per cent lighter than its Orma material introduced in the
1960s. Both companies' products use material with a high refraction index
which requires less curvature.
Essilor and Sola (owned by Pilkington of the UK which has put it up for
sale) are the main players in the world spectacles market, but there are a
host of smaller competitors such as Rodenstock and Zeiss in Germany, Hoya,
Seiko and Nikon in Japan, and American Optical, Signet Armorlite and Vision
Ease in the US.
'The market is highly competitive,' says John Heine, Sola's chief executive.
In the expanding presbyope market, so-called progressive lenses have gained
in popularity as they do away with the segment lines on bifocal or trifocal
lenses and the need to switch between glasses for reading and other uses.
With a progressive lens, the wearer - there are 130m presbyopes in Europe -
can move through a family of lenses whose outer curve changes gradually as
eyesight worsens. Essilor's Varilux Multi Design, in plastic or glass, has
12 lenses, while Sola has its rival Graduate and XL products; as with all
corrective lenses, it is the carving out of the inner curve which gives the
lens its individual character.
'It's quite a complex operation to shape the surface and get the power
without a segment line showing,' says Colin Perrott, Sola's head of
technology. 'In future, there will be a multiple choice of different lens
designs according to people's lifestyles and different materials according
to taste.'
Apart from frame and lens shapes and the materials used, spectacle wearers
can also satisfy their varying tastes by having coatings applied. These are
used to make plastic lenses scratch resistant, eliminate reflection, repel
water, and either tint lenses or enable them to darken in sunlight.
At Essilor's UK plant near Bristol, the quartz anti-reflection coating is
put on in a special vacuum chamber using sophisticated computer-controlled
machines. The coating works by turning the light reflection back on itself.
Fremont says Essilor's anti-reflection coating increases sight transmission
from 92.5 to 99.6 per cent. Most coatings absorb damaging ultra-violet rays.
For work on screens - now covered in the EC by a special directive -
companies have developed tints that soothe the eyes. Essilor, in partnership
with PPG Industries of the US, has also come up with a way of giving plastic
lenses something approaching the photochromic quality of glass, enabling
them to darken fashionably in sunlight. Vanity may not rule the world of
optics, but it has a strong influence.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Brushing off the
welcome mat - Michael Skapinker looks at Holiday Inn's efforts to improve
standards and woo back customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Raymond Lewis, Holiday Inn's head of marketing, tells the story of an
apprehensive American woman who arrives in Beijing, sees a building with a
Holiday Inn sign on it and weeps with relief.
There are other stories, such as the couple, travelling through the US some
years ago, who entered a Holiday Inn and left minutes later, appalled by the
squalor.
Lewis does not deny such things have happened. Holiday Inn accepts that by
the end of the 1980s standards at some of its US hotels had deteriorated,
damaging the company's reputation.
When Holiday Inn began in 1952 its aim was to spare travellers unpleasant
surprises. Kemmons Wilson, its founder, built the first Holiday Inn in
Memphis, Tennessee, after despairing of the poor quality of US hotels.
When Bass, the UK brewing and leisure group, bought Holiday Inn in 1990, its
priority was to restore the company's good name, probably the world's
best-known hotel brand. The company owns an advanced computerised booking
system, which it values at Dollars 250m (Pounds 177m). But unlike some hotel
companies, Holiday Inn has not been a big investor in property assets. The
company owns only 104 of the more than 1,700 Holiday Inns worldwide. It
manages some others, but most are run by franchisees. The Holiday Inn brand
is the company's most important asset.
'A brand describes a set of expectations,' Lewis says. 'How you deliver
against those expectations is the strength of your brand. Anyone can get a
customer in the door the first time. But the way you build a business is by
getting them back.'
The first challenge was to raise the standards of its hotels, about 90 per
cent of which are in the US, to ensure customer expectations of a reliable
service were met.
Bryan Langton, Holiday Inn chairman since the Bass takeover, says the
company needed a sense of urgency. He found 2,450 staff at the company's
headquarters in Memphis, many under-employed. 'You could have had a heart
attack and died at your desk and you wouldn't have been discovered for a
couple of weeks,' he says. He moved the headquarters to Atlanta, reducing
staff to just over 1,000.
Michael Leven, the executive charged with raising the franchised hotels'
standards, is ideally suited to the task, having once been thrown out of the
Holiday Inn system after a disagreement over spending on upgrading. Holiday
Inn later hired him as president of its franchise division. He believes the
brand pulls in customers. Nevertheless, when he came to Holiday Inn the
first thing that struck him was the lethargy. 'The franchise division was
living on past glories,' he says.
Inspection of franchised Holiday Inns has been increased from once to twice
a year. In his first year, Leven deprived 75 Holiday Inns of their
franchises. Last year, 30 were thrown out. Leven expects this year's number
to be 75.
He closed down the Holiday Inn training 'university' in Mississippi,
replacing it with smaller courses at the Atlanta headquarters. By the end of
1994, all the US hotels will have facilities to do their training on their
own premises. A group of 32 trainers, dubbed 'Roads Scholars', travel to the
hotels. However, they will soon be replaced by 42 trainers, known as Area
Service Delivery Consultants.
The second challenge facing Holiday Inn is to protect and expand its
position in the crowded, medium-priced market. In the 1950s, there were two
medium-priced hotel chains, Holiday Inn and Howard Johnson. By the 1980s,
they had been joined by chains such as Renaissance, Clarion, Ramada, Quality
and Courtyard.
Holiday Inn's previous managers had created two new brands, Embassy Suites
and the budget Hampton Inn chain. Under Bass, the company has decided to
keep the Holiday Inn name, using sub-brands to expand its share of the
medium-priced market.
In the US, in addition to its standard hotels, the company has set up
Holiday Inn Express hotels which are pitched at the cheaper end of the
middle market. In Europe and South Africa, Holiday Inn Garden Court hotels
aim to draw in a more budget-conscious market.
Above its standard hotels, the company has the more up-market Holiday Inn
Crowne Plaza hotels, a name created by the previous management. Langton sees
the Crowne Plazas as the solution to another problem: the difference in
quality between Holiday Inn's hotels in the US and in Europe, where they are
considerably smarter.
The absence of a uniform standard is a weakness at a time of increasing
international travel. All the large hotel groups try to persuade their US
customers to use their hotels when they travel. Langton argues Crowne Plazas
offer a worldwide standard.
Managers in competing companies say the rehabilitation of the Holiday Inn
name has some way to go. The Crowne Plaza hotels are seen as particularly
vulnerable to competition from more expensive brands.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The high cost of
creativity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies are paying through the nose for the consultancy, creative and
production skills involved in UK newspaper and magazine advertisements.
That has long been suspected; now there is supporting evidence, according to
collaborative research conducted by the Incorporated Society of British
Advertisers, in conjunction with Advertising Research Marketing, a marketing
communications company applying fixed-cost methods.*
The results make grim reading. Why, for example, should one advertiser have
paid production costs of Pounds 4,115 and a different advertiser Pounds
80,000, both for a four-colour double-page spread advertisement? Even
allowing for variation in specifications, such as photography, there is no
strong reason for the anomaly.
The report reveals many instances of agencies seeking to augment profits by
loading inadequately invoiced costs on to the production stage of the press
advertising process.
Such costs are not those incurred in buying media space; they are the simple
and easily accountable costs involved in producing the creative concept, the
artwork, photography and so forth.
A recently privatised national public utility received a bill for Pounds
17,000 for the production work on a newspaper advertisement; another
advertisement for the same utility, which reproduced the same images as its
earlier ad with slight changes to the copy, was billed at Pounds 41,000.
Such findings are bound to generate considerable controversy among
advertising agencies, which are continuing to feel the pinch in the current
recession. The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising revealed at the end
of January that in 1992 another 1,000 jobs had been lost among IPA members
based in London.
Moreover, a new book to be published in March - Industrial Marketing
Communications** - indicates the proportion of industrial and business-to
 business advertisers dispensing with the services of an advertising agency
has increased from 9 per cent in 1977 to 20 per cent today. Advertising
agencies are increasingly losing out to direct mail and public relations
activities.
The ISBA/ARM research suggests that press advertising in the UK is subject
to 'generally poor costing standards' and that there are 'very widespread
and fundamental inadequacies in the standard of management controls and
procedures throughout the estimating and invoicing path'.
John Orsmond, chairman of ARM, says: 'Until agencies abandon variable-cost
practices, they will never achieve the transparency and costing stability
their clients are now demanding.'
One area of complete opacity in the production of press advertising is that
of consultancy charges. One advertiser was charged Pounds 52,000 for 'the
thinking that lay behind' the pan-European concept of the advertisement in
question.
When it came to invoicing for the creative aspect of the production process,
91 per cent of those surveyed had no idea how the figure they were charged
was arrived at by their agency.
In the recession the finance director has regained status viz-a-viz the
marketing boss; advertisers are demanding explanations of large bills
without clear, item-by-item invoicing.
Following the lead set by the ISBA, which published its own guide to best
practice in dealing with advertising agencies in 1992, the IPA has just
issued its own guidance note on best practice in the selection of an
advertising agency.
Among the advice aimed at advertisers considering how best to select from
the many excellent advertising agencies on the IPA roster, though, there is
nothing about how to tell from invoices if the agency work is above or below
what might be considered a reasonable market rate.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Anyone for pizza?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Peter Boizot brought authentic Italian pizza to Britain in the
mid-1960s some early customers suggested he put chips on the Pizza Express
menu. Others mistook the oregano for grass.
But Boizot stood firm and ultimately his recipe for high-quality pizzerias
proved a classic marketing success. From a single Soho restaurant in 1965
the Pizza Express chain has grown to include 68 company-owned and franchised
restaurants which generated Pounds 1.5m in operating profits on turnover of
Pounds 16.3m last year and sold 6.5m pizzas.
Today its shares will begin trading on the stock exchange for the first time
following a complex reverse takeover by the publicly quoted Star Computer
group worth almost Pounds 15m.
Mintel, the independent market researchers, said in a report last autumn
that since 1987 the size of the pizza/pasta market in the UK has more than
doubled to an estimated Pounds 694m last year.
Pizza Express has become Britain's most popular pizza chain despite spending
little on advertising. Instead it has relied on its predominantly upmarket,
loyal customers to spread the word.
Along the way Pizza Express has succeeded in trouncing a handful of
look-alike rivals including Pizza Hut, the market leader in terms of
outlets, PizzaLand and Deep Pan Pizza. So what is the secret?
David Page, who ran the largest group of franchised Pizza Express
restaurants and is managing director of the new publicly quoted group,
believes the success is due to Boizot's refusal to compromise on quality or
authenticity.
For example, Boizot insisted on using real Italian pizza ovens which provide
a very hot, dry heat. The Pizza Express interiors have all been designed by
Enzo Apicella to exploit the character of each individual building.
Similarly the menu has changed little in the last 28 years - even the
introduction of cappucino coffee machines has been resisted - and only
genuine mozzarella cheese and Italian tomatoes are used.
Robert Bird has been in charge of food quality control for 14 years and the
group runs a 'secret eater programme' designed to check everything from
quality of food and service to the tiling in the toilets.
Aside from pizza, Boizot's other passions include Venice, hockey and jazz,
all of which have become associated with the group. More than Pounds 300,000
has been donated to the Venice in Peril appeal fund from a 25p surcharge on
Pizza Veneziana.
It might be tempting for Pizza Express's new management to try to squeeze a
few more margin points out of the business by scaling down some of these
activities, or tinkering with the formula.
But Page, Luke Johnson and Hugh Osmond, who put the Star Computer deal
together, insist there are no plans for change. 'It has been successful
because it is authentic,' says Page.

FT  18 FEB 93 / People: Nomura hires Ruland to head German team
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nomura, which last October closed its European equity market-making
operations and sacked 50 people, has hired Heino Ruland as head of its
German equity research and marketing, a new post.
Japan's largest securities house denies any inconsistency in its strategy
for the Continent, pointing out that Germany is its most important market in
Europe after the UK and says that it will continue to provide and expand in
areas which it thinks are profitable.
Ruland, who will be based in London, lives in Frankfurt and spends a good
proportion of his time in Germany, will be responsible for pulling together
Nomura's German resources - currently two country analysts in Frankfurt
together with the London-based sector analysts. Since the events of last
October, the latter look at industries very much on a pan-European basis.
Unusually for a German financier, Ruland, who is just 36, has moved about in
his 15 years in the securities business. He joined Dresdner Bank straight
from school - later doing an economics degree at night school - but has also
been at Bank in Liechtenstein, Morgan Stanley and Bank Julius Baer. Then, he
had only been at Barings Securities as the co-head of its Frankfurt
operations for ten months when the UK merchant bank decided to reorganise
its activities in order to concentrate on southern Europe.
Nomura says that his depth of experience, his youth, and his 'bicultural'
approach, singled him out as the strongest candidate. His penchant for
collecting classic Mercedes convertibles as well as for riding Harley
Davidson Soft Tails presumably also distinguished him somewhat from the
herd.

FT  18 FEB 93 / People: Why Paul Kilduff has left TDG
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Cole, chief executive of Transport Development Group, is on the lookout
for what will be the fourth finance director he has worked with since he
stepped into the boss's seat just over two years ago.
Paul Kilduff, who joined from National Westminster last August, has just
resigned 'by mutual agreement'. While Cole will not admit that there was a
personality clash, he says 'it didn't work out. We both agreed we had made
the wrong choice.' Asked what Kilduff had done since he arrived, he added
'he has not had time to do a lot'.
Kilduff, 39, had been headhunted from NatWest where he had spent just 10
months as head of group strategy. The same firm of headhunters is now
looking for his replacement. Previously, Kilduff had been finance director
of Sealink for three years, before it was taken over by Stena; the Swedes
brought in their own team, though sources close to Kilduff indicate he
parted on very generous terms. Before Sealink the Peat Marwick-trained
chartered accountant had been at Lonrho as finance director of Metropole
Group between 1985 and 1987. Earlier in his career he had spent a year as
chief financial executive of Micro Focus at the time of its stock market
flotation.
Five months after Cole became chief executive, David Horner, who had been
finance director since 1973, took early retirement at age 57. Stephen
Bodger, from ML Holdings, was his successor, but last August Bodger was put
in charge of TDG's troubled French operations. Bodger, who remains on the
board, had wanted a 'managerial role', according to Cole, who emphasises
that the move constituted 'career enhancement'.

The Earl of Limerick (above) has been given a licence to print money. The
former merchant banker has taken over the chairmanship of De La Rue, the
world's largest commercial printer of banknotes.
Pat Limerick, 62, replaces Peter Orchard, chairman for the past five years,
who died suddenly last month. He has been on the De La Rue board since 1983

De La Rue is also strengthening its board. John Robb, Wellcome's 56-year-old
chief executive, has been appointed a non-executive director and Robert
Gardner, 56, managing director of De La Rue's payment systems division, also
joins the board. He came from Gestetner in July 1990.
Despite his aristocratic background, the Old Etonian sixth Earl of Limerick
is well plugged into the City - which could be useful if corporate predators
were ever to show interest in De La Rue again.
A chartered accountant by training, he spent 20 years as a director of
Kleinwort Benson rising to be deputy chairman. A former chairman of the
British Overseas Trade Board and British Invisibles, he has a number of
other chairmanships including Pirelli UK and AMP Asset Management.

Bill Morrison, deputy senior partner of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick has
announced that he is to leave the firm at the end of September this year.
Morrison, 55, insisted yesterday that his departure was 'completely
amicable' and that he was leaving 'to pursue an alternative career'. He
would not say what that would be, but he will remain a consultant to the
firm.
His departure raises a question over his continuing in the role of chairman
of the Auditing Practices Board, the UK's new standards-setting body for
auditors, when the current term comes up for renewal, but he says he would
be happy to continue.
Morrison has been deputy senior partner since KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock
was formed in 1987 after the merger between KMG Thomson McLintock, of which
he was managing partner, and Peat Marwick Mitchell.
He was also president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland
in 1984-85, and has been visiting professor in accountancy at the University
of Strathclyde since 1983.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Accountancy Column: Time for auditors to come out of their
shells - Michael Fowle clarifies the profession's role in business and its
future direction and development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL FOWLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS time that auditors 'came out'. We should demonstrate that our
profession is a fundamental part of risk management in the economy, that we
are proud of our contribution and want to do our job even better in the
future than we have in the past.
I am an auditor and I am proud of it. My predecessors built my firm on a
reputation for providing a service to those who used the accounts of their
audit clients - and not by kowtowing to the wishes of company directors.
That is the past of auditing and so must it be its future. I am passionate
about auditing and its contribution to business society.
The UK Auditing Practices Board (APB) paper on the future development of
auditing issued last November gives us plenty to think about. Its authors
make clear that it is intended to promote public debate, and is certainly
not a worked-through proposal, let alone a legal framework. But reflecting
the diversity of public concern, its scope is so wide-ranging that it runs
the risk of prompting a series of unending debates.
I want to return to basics. The public role of auditors is to audit
accounts. They may - and indeed do - fulfil other functions which contribute
materially to the benefit of the economy, but the essential issue is that of
competence in their primary function.
An audit report is a matter of opinion - an opinion in support of facts, and
on their presentation. Failures in audit evidence do occur, but they are
surprisingly rare and we have to remember that no process of inquiry can be
absolutely conclusive.
Opinion on presentation is an opinion on the way in which the directors have
set out the facts and arrived at judgments where these are required. Neither
opinion is of any worth unless it is objectively arrived at.
The APB paper notes that the small number of audit reports which are
qualified is seen by some as indicating a lack of objectivity. But this
confuses a qualified audit report with an auditor's badge of virility.
Auditors do their duty to the stakeholders by assisting, advising - and, on
occasions, persuading - their clients' directors to publish accounts which,
in the auditors' opinion, show a true and fair view.
A qualified audit report is not only an expression of the auditors' opinion
that the directors have failed to comply with the law. It is also an
admission by the auditors that they have failed effectively to influence the
directors. Qualified audit reports are indeed rare, but this is a sign of
success, not failure.
On every single public interest audit engagement, auditors in my firm work
for at least four separate client constituencies, whose interests may well
conflict. There are shareholders; other stakeholders and regulators who may
represent their interests; the board; and executive management. If auditors
cannot build a working relationship with the executive directors and
management of their client company, they can never undertake a truly
efficient and effective audit.
There is no point in being frightened of conflicts of interest. The world is
built on them. My favourite working definition of a professional is somebody
who can identify conflicts and make judgments amongst them. Good auditors
understand that not only can they serve all four client constituencies, but
that they must serve all four. If the audit fails to do so, it fails as an
audit.
That is why the Cadbury Report on corporate governance is entirely right to
concentrate not on auditor independence but on achieving auditor
objectivity. Good auditors have always known that because they serve four
constituencies, their first duty is not to the directors of their client
company but to the company itself. It is the company and only the company
which can be the proxy for the stakeholders - in particular the
shareholders, who are the prime stakeholders.
On this issue auditors are in the same position as the directors. But this
legal relationship in no way detracts from the essential fact that both
directors and auditors owe their duty to the shareholders and stakeholders.
Auditors know this very well.
Auditors also know the importance of understanding the framework within
which they operate. Their critics sometimes find this less essential. One
example is accounting standards, which are not the province of the Auditing
Practices Board but of the Accounting Standards Board. The roles of these
related but necessarily distinct bodies are often confused in the public
mind.
Another instance is the failure to grasp that it is management that manages
companies, and directors who set and monitor a direction. It is directors -
not auditors - who are responsible for reporting to shareholders on the
company's business, its financial results and future prospects.
The heart of the question is not the narrow one of professional liability
nor the details of what an audit report is meant to say. It is the
fundamental issue of the function of auditors and where they stand in
relation to management. We do not wish to take cover behind a defensive
barricade. We welcome the opportunity to contribute more effectively to the
economic process, and in so doing to respond to the needs of the market.
But the APB suggests that the purpose of an audit should be re-defined
beyond the auditors' current role to encompass reporting both on the proper
conduct of the company's affairs and/or future risks attaching to the
company. Surely these suggestions address not the role and scope of audit,
but the role and scope of annual reports by directors to shareholders?
It is for the directors to report to the shareholders and other stakeholders
and only then for the auditor to express an opinion on this report. If you
move to a position where reporting is in the first place the duty of
auditors not directors, this denies the auditors' essential role as
objective commentators and effectively makes them another tier of
management.
There are strong arguments for suggesting that directors should be given an
enhanced responsibility to stakeholders other than shareholders. There are
strong arguments that directors should report each year to shareholders on
the way the company's affairs have been conducted and on how they have
satisfied themselves on the propriety and perhaps the efficiency of that
conduct.
There are also strong arguments for suggesting that the directors should
report to shareholders about the risks inherent in the group's business and
the way in which they ensure that those risks are appreciated and
appropriately limited. This last proposal is covered in the Operating and
Financial Review proposal from the Accounting Standards Board circulated
last April.
Auditors are neither guarantors, nor guardian angels, nor soothsayers. But
if the reporting standards for directors encompass the issues of proper
conduct and future risks, and if the benchmarks are there, we auditors will
be able to obtain information, verify it, make judgments and arrive at
opinions on those matters of conduct and risk on which an objective opinion
is both practicable and relevant. It is then for the business world to judge
whether the cost will match the benefit.
Michael Fowle is senior UK audit partner at KPMG Peat Marwick.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Familiar ground is scoured again: Alan Pike predicts what
Virginia Bottomley is likely to tell Michael Portillo when his search for
savings moves to the NHS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, will tread hallowed
ground when he takes the government's review of public expenditure into the
Department of Health.
It is less than five years since a small ministerial committee, including
Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister, and Mr John Major, her successor,
undertook a similar task as part of the review leading to the 1991 National
Health Service reforms.
They discovered that the NHS stands up to international comparison as a
broadly efficient means of delivering healthcare - one reason why Britain's
GDP expenditure on health is relatively low. But they also discovered that
healthcare costs rise faster than general inflation, and that public
expectations - fuelled by factors such as the growing number of elderly
people in the population - rise faster still.
Mr Portillo will make the same discoveries. Health has benefited from more
generous financial settlements than most Whitehall departments in recent
years. Yet his spending review will start its quest for savings when doctors
and other NHS staff are again saying the service is underfunded - and when
there is little appetite among ministers for radical reform. The unthinkable
about the NHS was examined five years ago during the Thatcher review, when
the main alternative way of funding health care - through individual
insurance - was examined.
The No Turning Back group of Conservative MPs - of which Mr Portillo is a
member - and free-market think tanks put forward ideas such as offering tax
concessions for taking out private insurance and opting out of NHS
provision.
The government decided to retain the taxation-based system, and given the
political problems encountered in introducing its health reforms there is no
enthusiasm among ministers - and little among backbenchers  - for reopening
these arguments.
Re-examination would, in any case, almost certainly lead to retention of the
status quo. Tax incentives were rejected because they would encourage
working-age people, who use the NHS least, to opt out. Their tax revenue
would be lost, while NHS costs would be little changed.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, will tell Mr Portillo she is
trying to attract more private-sector investment. Health authorities and
hospitals are being urged to seek joint ventures with the private sector in
providing expensive equipment and services such as waste incineration and
energy conservation.
The Independent Healthcare Association would like the government to go
further and involve the private sector in overall national health planning,
and increase opportunities for private hospitals to treat NHS patients. This
is starting to happen through the activities of GP fund-holders, but is
unlikely to offer great savings to the NHS.
Mrs Bottomley will tell Mr Portillo the NHS is becoming more efficient as a
result of the 1991 reforms. She will point to an increase in the number of
patients treated through cost-effective advances like day-case surgery. She
will cite her plans to reform London healthcare as a further example of her
determination to get maximum value from her Pounds 29bn budget. But these
developments will, at best, help reduce the NHS's appetite for extra funds
rather than provide opportunities for savings.
Attempts by politicians to curb health spending, either by raising
prescription and other charges or reducing activity, are almost as old as
the NHS itself. They invariably cause political agony.
Lord Lawson, the former chancellor recalls in his book The View from Number
11 that when in 1982 the Thatcher government was presented with a think tank
programme of cuts, including replacing parts of the NHS with compulsory
health insurance, it caused 'the nearest thing to a cabinet riot in the
history of the Thatcher administration.'
After a decade of accusations that its good faith towards the NHS was in
doubt, the government would find such decisions even more difficult now -
even if it did not have a manifesto commitment to annual increases in real
NHS resources.
Next month Mrs Bottomley will speak at a British Medical Association
conference on health rationing. This marks the beginning of a brave attempt
by politicians and doctors to tell the public that no healthcare system can
deliver every possible good thing. Priorities must be agreed.
Such an approach, which implies putting gradual limits on the scope of NHS
activities, offers the best long-term hope of containing health expenditure.
But it is a difficult and sensitive debate, and one that has hardly started
in Britain.
Mr Portillo will be looking for speedy savings, not philosophical shifts in
attitudes. The NHS has few to offer.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Inflation 'may breach government target'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION may rise above the government's target of between 1 per cent and 4
per cent by the end of this year, an independent think tank said yesterday.
The forecast, in the latest quarterly report from the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research, comes a day after the Bank of England warned
that interest rate cuts could threaten the government's inflationary goals.
According to the report the retail prices index, excluding mortgage interest
payments - the measurement taken by the government for underlying inflation
 -will be 4.6 per cent higher in the last quarter of this year than in the
same period last year. The figure for the final quarter of 1994 is 4.7 per
cent. That is considerably higher than the government's goal for underlying
inflation of less than 2 per cent by the end of this parliament.
The index including mortgage interest payments will be 5.1 per cent higher
in the last quarter of 1994 than in the same period this year.
The report's economic growth projections are more optimistic than the
government's most recent forecast of 1 per cent for this year. The institute
says the economy will grow by 2 per cent this year.
The report predicts that unemployment will continue to rise and peak at 3.2m
in the first quarter of next year.
The institute, which is headed by Mr Andrew Britton, one of the 'seven wise
men' on the Treasury's recently formed advisory panel, recommends that the
chancellor should present a 'neutral' Budget in March. Although tax
increases might be necessary in December, the report says, they should be
avoided next month.
It adds: 'If the economy develops as our central forecasts predict, then we
must expect to be recommending increases in interest rates by this time next
year.'
As a result of devaluation, the report predicts that average import prices
will be 12 per cent higher this year than in 1992, representing a key
inflationary pressure. Sterling is expected to sink further against the
dollar in the short term, although the report also predicts a slight rise
against European currencies next year.
The report's forecasts for the public sector borrowing requirement are
similar to the those of the government: borrowing is expected to reach
Pounds 37.8bn in 1992-93, rising to Pounds 43.4bn in 1993-94.
Concern is also expressed about the way responsibility for combating
inflation is divided between the government and the Bank of England.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Rate-cut boost for house sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE revival in house sales is continuing with the help of low interest rates
and low house prices, estate agents and builders said yesterday.
A survey of more than 100 English and Welsh estate agents published by the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reported that the improvement in
sales seen over Christmas and the new year had been sustained.
It said that the revival had spread to even previously worst affected
markets such as the east Midlands, East Anglia and south-east England.
The survey warned, however, that it was too early to talk of a long-lasting
recovery while potential house buyers continued to worry about the
possibility of losing their jobs.
Some 65 per cent of estate agents said that prices had remained static
during the three months to the end of January, while one third said that
prices were still falling.
Wimpey, Britain's second largest housebuilder, said yesterday that last
weekend was the best for sales for several years.
Agreed sales were running at more than a fifth higher than during the
corresponding period last year.
Housebuilder Bellway said that agreed sales had risen by 50 per cent since
the new year compared with 12 months earlier.
More consumers are repaying credit, indicating that they may have more
disposable income, according to a report by Infolink, a consultancy which
supplies information about consumer loans.
It says that in the final quarter of last year 91.2 per cent of consumers
with credit accounts were up to date with their repayment installments. That
compared with 89.6 per cent in the equivalent period in 1991.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Packaging sector rise signals upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS of an economic upturn have been strengthened by indications of
sharp growth in recent months in the production of cardboard packaging,
Peter Marsh writes.
The material is used in a wide range of consumer and manufacturing sectors,
and the amount produced is considered a good advance indicator of economic
trends.
According to Maurice Palmer Associates, a consultancy specialising in
packaging, cardboard production increased 3.1 per cent in the final quarter
of last year compared with the same period in 1991.
For last year as a whole, production grew by 2.1 per cent compared with the
previous year. The consultancy believes consumer goods production will show
a 2 per cent year-on-year rise in the first quarter of this year.
About 3.4bn sq m of cardboard packaging were produced in Britain last year,
with virtually all of this sold to UK-based companies in industries
including food, drinks, household goods, medicines and factory equipment.

FT  18 FEB 93 / London's vacant office space falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL London's empty office space fell by 7 per cent in the second half of
last year, reversing a six-year trend that pushed vacancy rates up to record
levels.
Available office space in London, including developments due for completion
within six months, peaked at 34.3m sq ft last June, according to DTZ
Debenham Thorpe, property advisers.
By the end of the year, it had fallen to 32m sq ft, equivalent to 17 per
cent of the total office space in London.
The main factor in reducing available space was the sharp drop in completion
of new offices. The amount of new offices coming on to the market in the
fourth quarter of last year fell to 2.9m sq ft, its lowest quarterly figure
since 1987.
In addition, the take-up of offices rose to 10.6m sq ft, an increase of 15
per cent on the previous year, but only about two-thirds of the peak annual
level reached in 1989-90.
DTZ Debenham Thorpe said the balance of supply and demand was likely to
remain fundamentally different from that before 1987.
It said total office stock in central London had increased by over a fifth
since 1986 while employment levels in the financial and business services
sector had dropped below 1986 levels.
The oversupply of London office space has resulted in a fall in rent of
about 30 per cent in the year to November 1992.
In the same period, capital values have dropped by 24 per cent in the City
and by 17 per cent in the West End.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Bart's will hold talks on merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS at St Bartholomew's hospital in the City of London yesterday agreed
to take part in talks on a merger with the Royal London hospital.
The move came only 24-hours after an announcement on the future of
healthcare in London by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, had
left Bart's in a seriously exposed position.
Professor Michael Besser, Bart's chief executive, met officials of the North
East Thames Regional Health Authority yesterday and told them the hospital
was prepared to discuss arrangements for a new National Health Service trust
merging the management of Bart's and the Royal London. Bart's will explain
its decision in a statement today.
Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report on London healthcare concluded that the
health needs of the City and east London would be best served by a merged
Bart's-Royal London hospital on the latter's site in the East End.
Bart's fought to retain its independence in the most high-profile of all the
campaigns against the Tomlinson recommendations.
Although Mrs Bottomley's announcement on Tuesday presented three options for
Bart's - closure, merger with the Royal London or continuation as a much
smaller, specialist hospital - it was immediately clear that its chances of
independent survival in the NHS market were slim.
Prof Besser said last night that Bart's would enter discussions on merged
management with the Royal London on equal terms. Bart's had rejected the
option of continuing as a scaled-down specialist hospital because the
proposed unit would have been so small the market could have been
manipulated to deprive it of funds.
Mr Michael Fairey, chief executive of the Royal London trust, said last
night: 'I shall be delighted if Bart's managers wish to enter discussions
with us.' A merged hospital could only benefit from the high level of
medical excellence Bart's possessed.
It would be for the new trust management to rationalise services, and some
Bart's managers and doctors will hope to retain a range of activities on
their City site. But the full cost benefits of the Tomlinson recommendations
will be achieved only if locations are vacated, and there will be strong
pressures to transfer services to the Royal London's 26-acre site.
Doctors and managers at the Charing Cross Hospital in west London vowed
yesterday to fight on to save their institution, which faces an uncertain
future.
Their hopes are pinned on a government review of specialist services.
Charing Cross has, among its specialist departments, the second-largest
cancer treatment centre in Britain and managers believe they can make a
convincing case for the hospital's retention.

BUSINESSES which make extensive use of private telecommunications networks
will be able to predict their costs with greater confidence following an
agreement between British Telecommunications and the industry regulator
Oftel.
The organisations have agreed to a formula controlling the prices BT will
charge for private circuits for the period 1993 to 1997. It sets a cap on
the rate of inflation on three families or 'baskets' of private circuits -
national analogue circuits, national digital circuits and international
circuits.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Trust manager is suspended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WESSEX Asset Management, a Winchester-based unit trust manager with roughly
200 unitholders, has been suspended from carrying on further investment
business by Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry.
The unitholders have invested in a single unit trust called the Wessex UK
Growth Fund. The suspension followed a review of the company's
administrative procedures in December.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Demand from funds on costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Association of Pension Funds is urging regulators to make fund
managers disclose full costs to their clients, Norma Cohen writes.
According to Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the association's investment
committee, the association will soon ask Imro, the self- regulatory body for
the fund management industry, whether Imro considers the extent to which
full disclosure of fees and charges is made when deciding whether a fund
manager is 'fit and proper' to carry out investment business.
Yesterday the association, the trade body for the pensions industry,
unveiled the results of a year-long study on fees and indirect charges which
concludes that practices in the industry allow managers to profit without
their clients' knowledge.
While fund managers typically charge their clients a 'headline' fee equal to
between 0.15 and 0.25 per cent of assets under management, there are other
charges which are not easily evident, the association says. These include
additional management fees for investments in unit trusts and custody
charges.
'We found that trustees and clients did not know what their manager was up
to and their consultant could not help them,' said Mr John McLaughlan,
investment director at United Friendly Insurance and chairman of the NAPF
group that wrote the report.

FT  18 FEB 93 / BT deal on private circuit charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESSES that make extensive use of private telecommunications networks
will be able to predict their costs with greater confidence following an
agreement between British Telecommunications and the industry regulator
Oftel.
The organisations have agreed to a formula controlling the prices BT will
charge for private circuits for the period 1993 to 1997. It sets a cap on
the rate of inflation on three families or 'baskets' of private circuit -
national analogue circuits, national digital circuits and international
circuits.
The agreement brings to an end a period of controversy over the control of
private circuit prices. Businesses, many of which have extensive and
long-established private analogue circuits, had been concerned about prices
which changed from year to year and made budgeting difficult.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Package sector rise signals upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS of an economic upturn have been strengthened with indications
of sharp growth in recent months in the production of cardboard packaging.
The material is used in a wide range of consumer and manufacturing sectors,
and the amount produced is considered a good advance indicator of economic
trends.
According to Maurice Palmer Associates, a consultancy specialising in
packaging, cardboard production increased 3.1 per cent in the final quarter
of last year compared with the same period in the previous year.
For last year as a whole, production grew by 2.1 per cent compared with the
previous year, after a 1.5 per cent annual fall in 1991. The consultancy
believes consumer goods production will show a 2 per cent year-on-year rise
in the first quarter of this year.
About 3.4bn sq m of cardboard packaging were produced in Britain last year,
with virtually all of this sold to UK-based companies in industries
including food, beverages, household goods, medicines and factory equipment.
More consumers are repaying credit, indicating that they may have more
disposable income, according to a report by Infolink, a consultancy which
supplies information about consumer loans. It says that in the final quarter
of last year 91.2 per cent of consumers with credit accounts were up to date
with their repayment installments. This compared with 89.6 per cent in the
equivalent period in 1991.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Fund managers 'fail to disclose full fees'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Association of Pension Funds is urging regulators to make fund
managers disclose full costs to their clients.
According to Mr Angus Matheson, chairman of the association's investment
committee, the association will soon write to Imro, the self-regulatory body
for the fund management industry. The letter will ask whether Imro considers
the extent to which full disclosure of fees and charges is made when
deciding whether a fund manager is 'fit and proper' to carry out investment
business.
Yesterday the association, the trade body for the pensions industry,
unveiled the results of a year-long study on fees and indirect charges which
concludes that practices in the industry allow managers to profit without
their clients' knowledge.
While fund managers typically charge their clients a 'headline' fee equal to
between 0.15 and 0.25 per cent of assets under management, there are other
charges which are not easily evident, the association says. These include
additional management fees for investments in unit trusts, custody charges
and failure to pay competitive interest rates on cash balances or on
balances arising from settlement failures.
The association says it has been unable to determine the extent of fund
managers' revenues earned from hidden fees.
However, Mr Nick Fitzpatrick, partner at consulting actuaries Bacon and
Woodrow, said his firm had conducted its own study and concluded that, on
average, fund managers earn nearly twice as much from clients as the
'headline' charge to the client indicates.
Mr Fitzpatrick said the Bacon and Woodrow study probably underestimated the
actual remuneration because it could not accurately quantify the additional
fees earned by fund managers who arranged foreign exchange and securities
transactions through their own affiliates.
'We found that trustees and clients did not know what their manager was up
to and their consultant could not help them,' said Mr John McLaughlan,
investment director at United Friendly Insurance and chairman of the NAPF
group that wrote the report.
In particular, the group singled out property investment, saying clients are
in the dark about how much they are paying. Because fee structures are
unclear and because they are largely transaction-driven, they could
encourage property fund managers to buy and sell portfolios for no other
reason than to generate income, the group added.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Manchester Olympics 'would bring in Pounds 4bn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH-WEST England would benefit to the tune of at least Pounds 4bn and gain
the equivalent of 11,000 full-time jobs if Manchester were to succeed in its
attempt to stage the Olympic Games in the year 2000, according to KPMG Peat
Marwick, the management consultants.
About Pounds 2.5bn would be generated by capital investment in new
facilities, environmental improvements and regeneration projects. Running
the games would be worth a further Pounds 1.5bn in sponsorship, media
activity, merchandising, tourism and additional income.
Manchester's final bid document was yesterday given the official blessing of
Mr John Major, the prime minister, to underline the government's commitment.
Manchester is bidding against Brasilia, Berlin, Milan, Istanbul, Beijing and
Sydney.
Mr Major said legislation was expected soon to give the organising committee
the necessary powers to plan and implement the event. He plans to visit
Lausanne in April to see Mr Juan Samaranch, president of the International
Olympic Committee.
Mr Tim Johnston, who led KPMG Peat Marwick's study team, said the figures
were conservative. Other benefits might include extra tax revenues to the
government of about Pounds 400m and a contribution to the UK balance of
payments, which a 1990 study by two academic economists put at Pounds 500m.
'We have only attached figures to what we can be reasonably be sure of,'
said Mr Johnston. 'We have not even tried to assess the inward investment
that might flow because of increased worldwide interest in Manchester,
although it would be very easy to say this might be worth 30,000 jobs.'
The games would generate 110,000 person-years of work, the study says.
Economic regeneration will be one of the criteria used by the International
Olympic Committee when it awards the games in September.
The compactness of the Olympic site will also be a criterion. The bid
document says 21 of the 25 Olympic sports would be within a 20-minute drive
of the Olympic village in Manchester.
The soccer tournament would use stadiums in Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield,
Birmingham, Nottingham, Sunderland and Newcastle, as well as Manchester,
while baseball would be staged at Old Trafford cricket ground.
Sailing would be in Cardigan Bay, based on Pwllheli, north Wales, with
shooting and modern pentathlon at Chester. Liverpool would stage the boxing
and volleyball in an arena at King's Dock - next to the Albert Dock - which
is to be developed to a Richard Rodgers architectural design.
The government has already given Pounds 70m towards the bid, and work is
under way on a velodrome for cycling and an arena for gymnastics.
Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority yesterday announced an
extension of its tram system to the main Olympic stadium site, which is
already being cleared.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Holiday company ceases trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUR OPERATOR Riva Travel yesterday said it had ceased trading because it
could not meet its financial obligations. It has 300 customers abroad and
60,000 bookings.
The company has links with Mr Harry Goodman, former chairman of the
International Leisure Group, which collapsed in 1991. Riva said last night
that Mr Goodman had worked as a consultant to the company. Ms Jackie
Kernaghan, Riva's managing director, formerly worked for ILG.
Riva was fully bonded, and the company said that customers' money was
protected and holidaymakers abroad would be repatriated. Repatriation and
administration of bookings will be handled by the Civil Aviation Authority.
The company had 52 employees including 40 in the UK. Staff were told late
yesterday afternoon that they no longer had jobs. Riva operated tours to the
Mediterranean, Florida and the Caribbean.
'The difficulties of the economic climate, the dramatic fall of sterling and
the resultant downturn in business for all tour operators made it impossible
for the company to obtain the additional funding it required,' Riva said
last night.
The company said that until noon yesterday it was negotiating with several
unnamed organisations 'to arrange a possible restructuring of its trading
operations. These negotiations having failed, the board had no alternative
but to cease trading'.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Watchdog to probe complaints against taxman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDEPENDENT adjudicator is to be appointed to consider complaints about
tax officials who are rude, slow or make mistakes.
The move is part of a new package of Citizen's Charter proposals unveiled
after a Downing Street seminar chaired by Mr John Major yesterday morning.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the Treasury financial secretary, said an adjudicator,
to be appointed by May, will have a remit to scrutinise complaints about how
the Revenue handles individuals' tax affairs, but will not trespass on areas
covered by existing rights of appeal.
The Revenue received 15,000 complaints last year, of which 100 were referred
to the government's ombudsman. Yesterday it said it expected the adjudicator
to handle 20 to 50 complaints a month.
Mr Dorrell said the adjudicator would be 'a person of standing' from outside
the Revenue, and described the new procedure as a readily available 'safety
valve'.
Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the Inland Revenue board, said the
appointment of the adjudicator would give taxpayers the assurance of an
impartial review and give tax officials greater protection against unfair
complaints.
The Revenue expects that most complaints will still be dealt with locally
but says that the new arrangements, which will apply to tax matters arising
after the beginning of April, will help to improve its standards of service.
The adjudicator's work will also cover the Valuation Office, and he or she
will publish a report annually to the Inland Revenue board, which will be
intended to draw general lessons for the service as well as redressing
individual grievances.
At the same time, the Revenue published three codes of conduct based on
existing practice, covering investigations, inspection of employers' PAYE
records, and dealing with its own mistakes.
The third six-monthly Downing Street seminar, intended to ensure that the
impetus behind the Citizen's Charter is not lost, also yielded a trickle of
other moves forward.
Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, said publication of
comparative information would be extended into areas such as hospitals and
further-education institutions.
Other initiatives for the seminar include a promise of a charter for the new
Child Support Agency; the introduction of a lay element into the police
inspectorate; and a commitment that charter standards would be included in
the contracts for holders of rail franchises under privatisation plans.

FT  18 FEB 93 / EC coal meeting likely next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL, MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is likely to visit
Brussels next week to present draft plans to the European Commission for
keeping open some of the UK's threatened coal mines.
The trip will add to speculation, already growing in the coal and
electricity industries, that the government will not now publish its white
paper on coal before the end of the month. The government has previously
said that it wanted to bring out the white paper as early as possible in
February.
Documents leaked last night demonstrated that the government is some way off
securing a deal with generators to take on extra coal, the main plank in its
draft white paper. Even if it can secure an agreement, it will then have to
clear its proposals with Brussels.
Although the rescue plans involving the generators should receive broad
approval from Commission energy officials, Mr Karel van Miert, the EC
competition commissioner, will insist that subsidies to UK pits should be
scaled down after 1995. According to draft plans circulating in London, coal
subsidies would be eliminated by 1998.
If Britain decided to subsidise coal beyond 1995, Mr van Miert has said he
will press for a reduction in the level of indirect aid granted to the
British nuclear industry. That could present problems for the government,
which wants to change present plans for the nuclear industry as little as
possible.
British and Commission officials in Brussels said yesterday that a firm date
had not been fixed for Mr Heseltine's visit. Much will depend on the
generator talks and whether he wants to consult the Commission before or
after presenting his draft plan to the UK cabinet.
Mr van Miert and Mr Abel Matutes, EC energy commissioner, are jointly
responsible for approving the British plan. Mr Matutes is anxious to avoid
penalising the EC's most efficient pits by hampering rescue efforts.
The Commission competition authorities are also believed to have considered
reviving anti-trust probes into medium-term contracts in the UK electricity
industry as a means of putting pressure on the British government over
subsidies.
British officials dismissed such threats this week, saying that the liberal
thrust of UK energy policy was in line with Commission thinking.
'Everything (the Commission) has said to us suggests there will be no
problem (with the Heseltine plan),' said one.
Commission energy officials argue that Brussels could not formally block a
five-year state aid plan for the British coal industry, because UK pits
would qualify for subsidies under current EC rules. The new coal subsidy
regime - which is supposed to take effect from next year - has not yet been
approved by member states.
The government yesterday played down the prospect that it might decide to
transfer a portion of the nuclear levy to coal as part of a pits rescue
package, David Owen writes.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said such a step only 'makes sense' if it was
assumed Nuclear Electric's liabilities were not 'genuine liabilities.' This,
he said, had not yet been established.
A High Court judge is expected to rule today on union claims that British
Coal is failing to comply with a previous ruling on consultation over 10
pits earmarked for early closure.

FOR Dr George Carey, ecumenism a la Maastricht has its limits. Although the
archbishop of Canterbury gives a general blessing to European integration,
he draws the line at the idea of monetary union leading to the head of his
Church disappearing from English pound notes.
'I want the Queen's head on the banknotes,' Dr Carey says. 'The point about
national identity is a very important one. For me being British is deeply
important. I don't want to become French or German.'
Speaking squashed into a window seat overlooking Westminster Abbey during
the Church of England synod this week, the archbishop spelled out his vision
of how Britishness and Europeanness could come together.
'To be British is not in competition with being European,' says Dr Carey,
who developed the theme during a visit last week to Strasbourg and Brussels
to see leaders of the European parliament, the Council of Europe and Nato.
His talks showed him: 'There is a great anxiety and desire for Britain to
belong to Europe and be committed to it.
'We as a nation come across to mainland Europe as reluctant Europeans. We
are brought into it squealing rather than rejoicing . . . Our future is in
Europe. Away from Europe we would decline into a little offshore island
because America is not going to do very much for us and the rest of the
world isn't (either).'
Dr Carey displays studied benignity towards Maastricht's arch-opponents. 'I
think the Maastricht treaty is rather like Stephen Hawking's A Brief History
Of Time and the Satanic Verses. People have got very fixed opinions about it
without having read it. I think we need to help people understand the
general shape of it.'
Asked about Lord Tebbit's distinctly Biblical description of the treaty as a
'foul abomination', Dr Carey rejoins: 'I respect Norman Tebbit as a clear
thinker. We need to pay close attention to his views. We mustn't rubbish
people. We need a real debate. We need to educate people. We need to help
one another to realise that where there are fears which are bogus, they need
to be laid.'
The archbishop takes a similarly understanding view of the FT's disclosure
last year that nearly Pounds 500m has been wiped off the value of Church of
England property investments as a result of heavy borrowing to finance
speculative property developments.
Dr Carey set up an inquiry, due to report after Easter. 'I'm grateful for
the Financial Times. I want an open church in an open society. Largely as a
result of that (the FT report) I've set up this inquiry of very able people
who will report. I can promise we're not going to whitewash it. The church
people who have given the money need to know where the money is going to.'
Dr Carey added, a touch archly: 'I hope the FT will not only look at the
Church of England but also at other big businesses which probably have
greater portfolios than ourselves, where more people are likely to go to the
wall than the dear old Church of England.'
Dr Carey says his Church, along with churches elsewhere in Europe, has a
central role in steering Europe down the path of righteous integration.
'When you are European in the Community you are member of a trading
community. But one of the points I've been putting out there is that you
have to move from selfishness to altruism. Most of us are in the Community
for selfish reasons, for economic reasons, for materialistic reasons. That's
not a good enough reason to belong. There have got to be cultural and
spiritual reasons . . . If we end up with a fortress Europe, that's not a
Christian Europe.'
The archbishop voices support for EC emphasis on subsidiarity - allowing
government decision-making to be carried out at the lowest level. 'This is
deeply important . . . It comes from a Christian philosophy. You only do
together what you have to do together. It respects some degree of
sovereignty for the state.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / Olympic Games spin-off put at Pounds 4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH-WEST England would benefit to the tune of at least Pounds 4bn and gain
the equivalent of 11,000 full-time jobs if Manchester were to succeed in its
attempt to stage the Olympic Games in the year 2000, according to KPMG Peat
Marwick, the management consultants.
About Pounds 2.5bn would be generated by capital investment in new
facilities, environmental improvements and regeneration projects. Running
the games would be worth a further Pounds 1.5bn in sponsorship, media
activity, merchandising, tourism and additional income.
Manchester's final bid document was yesterday given the official blessing of
Mr John Major, the prime minister, to underline the government's commitment.
Manchester is bidding against Brasilia, Berlin, Milan, Istanbul, Beijing and
Sydney.
Mr Major said legislation was expected soon to give the organising committee
the necessary powers to plan and implement the event.
Mr Tim Johnston, who led KPMG Peat Marwick's study team, said the figures
were conservative. Other benefits might include extra tax revenues to the
government of about Pounds 400m and a contribution to the UK balance of
payments, which a 1990 study by two academic economists put at Pounds 500m.
'We have only attached figures to what we can be reasonably be sure of,'
said Mr Johnston. 'We have not even tried to assess the inward investment
that might flow because of increased worldwide interest in Manchester,
although it would be very easy to say this might be worth 30,000 jobs.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / Rover to create 300 jobs at Cowley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER GROUP is to create 300 to 350 jobs at its recently modernised Cowley
plant near Oxford to double production of Maestro and Montego models to 600
a week.
The jobs are being offered initially on a six-month temporary basis and will
allow the introduction of two-shift working.
This temporary employment approach has been made possible because of Rover's
deal with unions last year to sweep away restrictive working practices.
Rover Group, the vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, said last night
that it needed the extra shift to meet what it described as a sharp upturn
in demand for the cars in the UK and continental Europe.
Recently the Cowley plant, which employs 4,700 people, introduced a night
shift for the 800 range, which has become the UK executive car sector
leader. The shift was also to prepare for the new Rover 600 model, developed
with Honda, which is to be launched in April.
Mr Paul Kirk, managing director of Rover's large cars division, said that
sharply increased UK demand for diesel versions of the Maestro and Montego
and a sales surge in Spain were mainly responsible for the expanded output.
The new jobs represent the first significant recruitment drive at Cowley -
where Rover has invested nearly Pounds 200m in recent years - for more than
five years.
Throughout much of the 1980s both unions and local authorities expressed
fears that Rover's long-term intentions were to close the complex.

OPPOSITION MPs yesterday accused Touche Ross, liquidators of the collapsed

future of corporate customers of the bank.
In the latest in a series of parliamentary early day motions, 44 MPs focused
on the case of Mone Bros, a small Leeds-based company, and charged Touche
with 'dishonouring agreements and putting jobs at risk'.
Having paid 'the full Pounds 250,000 agreed price for essential equipment,'
the motion stated, Mone was told that this was to be 'confiscated by Touche
Ross'.

PEUGEOT TALBOT warned its 3,500 manual workers not to go on all-out strike
from the end of tomorrow for higher pay. It said they would threaten their
own future job security.
In a letter to all employees Mr Mike Judge, the company's personnel
director, said Peugeot Talbot would not improve its two-year pay offer of
3.5 per cent this year and the greater of a further 3.5 per cent in 1994 or
the rate of in-flation.
The threat of disruption at the company comes after a prolonged period of
industrial relations peace there.

<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS in the electronics industry should recruit more school leavers and
train them to technician levels rather than employing graduates to perform
similar tasks, according to a study from the Policy Studies Institute.
Many of the companies in the study slashed their apprenticeship training
programmes in the early 1980s, believing that the future need was for
graduates skilled in both hardware and software systems.
This belief persisted in the face of experience. Graduates were harder to
recruit and tended to have higher rates of turnover than other levels of
staff.

TIMEX Electronic announced yesterday it was dismissing all 300 striking
assembly workers at its Dundee plant and replacing them with new staff as
soon as possible, Robert Taylor writes.
The US-owned company said it was going ahead with the sackings because the
strikers refused to accept a settlement of a 20-day dispute over a pay and
conditions package.
Last Sunday and again yesterday the workers agreed to return to work under
protest and accepted a company offer of arbitration. But they refused to
accept a wage freeze for the rest of the year, a cut in fringe benefits and
a profit-sharing scheme which the company was demanding.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Radical plan for balance sheets announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AMOUNT of debt declared in companies' accounts will increase
substantially and profits will fall under radical proposals unveiled
yesterday by the UK's accounting standards body.
Under the proposals companies, particularly banks, will be forced to include
on their balance sheets information which they have previously been able to
conceal in obscure notes to their accounts.
The draft rules introduce tough requirements on the treatment of many
complex accounting devices used by a growing number of companies to conceal
liabilities or inflate profits. They could become mandatory by the end of
this year.
Fred 4, the financial reporting exposure draft on off-balance-sheet
financing, is likely to lead to the biggest row yet between companies and
the Accounting Standards Board since its creation more than two years ago.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board, said: 'The whole subject has had an
unsavoury air in the past. These proposals break new ground and will cast
much-needed light into a murky corner.'
The draft says that companies must show on their balance sheets as assets
any transactions from which they receive benefits, and as liabilities any by
which they are exposed to risk.
Such transactions - previously off balance sheet - will include sale and
repurchase agreements, by which a company appears to have transferred an
asset to a third party but in fact has the right or requirement to buy it
back after a certain period.
Companies with certain securitised assets - those placed in a separate
company and sold on to other parties - will have to provide a 'linked
presentation' on the balance sheet showing the true state of underlying
assets and liabilities.
Businesses with a range of currency exposures will also have to show the
full extent of these risks separately rather than offsetting them against
one another.
The draft standard includes a series of illustrative examples of
transactions in an effort to ensure that companies obey the spirit, and not
simply the letter of the regulations.
Mr Tweedie warned that the board would act quickly to stamp out any attempts
by companies to introduce any new devices intended to skirt the rules.
Bankers complained that the plan would make it difficult for them to
securitise credit card business, which they are now considering.
Mr Malcolm Veale, head of NatWest securitisation, said the process required
by the rules was 'totally impractical'.
A growing number of companies have been using an expanding range of obscure,
rule-bending devices to conceal their full liabilities from readers of their
accounts.
'It's impossible to generalise,' said Mr Tweedie. 'Every scheme I have
looked at is different.'
It has taken a long time for standard-setters to take the subject seriously.
This partly reflects a rearguard action by companies. Banks were concerned
that they would breach the European Community's capital adequacy
requirements if forced to include securitised assets such as mortgages on
their balance sheets.

It would allow owners in multi-occupier developments to own the freehold

A TWO-SPEED Europe could deprive south-east England of annual income of up
to Pounds 10bn, according to a report published today backing a full UK role
in European integration.
The study, by the European Policy Forum, was commissioned by the Corporation
of London to underline the potential losses to the City if Britain failed to
ratify the Maastricht treaty.
The report says that Britain should maintain the policy of 'attachment' to
Europe, practised particularly after the single market programme was drawn
up in 1985.

FT  18 FEB 93 / 'Cracks' are identified in accounting standards rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCONSISTENCIES are creeping into the Accounting Standards Board's new
requirements and their implementation, an academic warned yesterday.
Speaking at the launch of the latest annual survey of company accounts from
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Mr Len Skerratt
of the University of Manchester said 'cracks' were appearing in the new
regime.
'The Accounting Standards Board has done a really good job,' he said. 'But
it's a bit like a game of Scrabble. The first words are easy to fit in. The
real problem is getting the last ones to be compatible.'
From a sample of 300 companies, the survey shows wide variations in those
choosing to allocate items such as foreign currency differences, goodwill
and revaluations between extraordinary items, exceptional items and reserve
movements.
Mr Skerratt highlighted an inconsistency in the way the ASB requires
companies to pass goodwill through the profit and loss account, while
passing the effect of revaluations through reserves.
He said its decision to require companies to classify all convertible
capital instruments as debt rather than shareholders' funds until they were
converted was inconsistent with its statement of principles, which says the
substance of a transaction should take precedence over its legal form.
He also pointed to variations in the way companies and their auditors had
interpreted the ASB's urgent issues task force ruling on the treatment of
goodwill on disposal of acquisitions.
The survey highlighted the growing use of 'pro-forma accounts', which do not
need to be audited but are included in the accounts because of significant
events after the balance sheet was approved.
It also showed that just 4 per cent of the companies had qualified reports
from their auditors, down from 6 per cent last year.
The proportion of companies showing intangible assets, such as brands and
patents, on their balance sheets jumped considerably from 59 per cent to 67
per cent. That comes in advance of an ASB discussion document on
intangibles.

people out of work for more than one year creeps up towards 1m again the
employment establishment is sticking as firmly as ever to the training
creed.
The government appears to accept the argument that training is of limited
use, especially to the well-qualified, white-collar unemployed. It is now
allowing Training and Enterprise Councils to choose who they train more than
ever before.
Money saved on training could go towards make-work schemes such as the
popular Community Programme, scrapped in 1988, which at its height employed
250,000. Or it could go to improving counselling by the Employment Service.
Experts say the service is amateurish at assessing people and needs to
establish a proper audit of the skills and aptitudes of each person as they
become unemployed.
But when the economy is simply not generating jobs, better assessment and
placement cannot do much. The apparent success of the compulsory Restart
interview for the long-term unemployed was partly based on diverting people
to the kinds of benefit support that takes them off the unemployment
register, such as disability.
The main training scheme for adults, Employment Training, was launched in
1988 at a time of skill shortages and worries about a shortage of
youngsters. This year it will cost Pounds 920m and train 200,000 people.
Critics say it is training too many electricians to become bricklayers and
bricklayers to become electricians. They also point out that a person who
has been on ET, who must have been unemployed for more than six months, has
only a 25 per cent chance of getting a job. Someone who has merely gone
through the Employment Service counselling service does better than that.
Counselling costs Pounds 275 for each successful job placement - ET costs
Pounds 10,000.
Supporters of training and make-work schemes see a lack of real conviction
by the establishment.
'Schemes for the unemployed have always been regarded as temporary things,
which is very damaging, and has meant that we have never really had a
worthwhile scheme,' says a senior civil servant.
The training lobby takes issue with the official figures for training versus
counselling. They say that ET has to deal with a more difficult client group
while the Employment Service creams off the best. Further, they say, ES
figures are not properly audited.
It is still the case that the unemployed are less well qualified than the
population as a whole, and unlike the early 1980s more than 50 per cent of
the long-term unemployed are under the age of 35. Skills they acquire could
have a lasting value.
Ms Karen Blackwood, 24, is one who has benefited. She left school in 1984
with 7 CSEs, but was made redundant after working as an audio-typist and
remained unemployed for eight months with employers saying her skills were
out of date.
Eventually she saw an advertisement in a paper for an ET course offering
'upskilling' as the way to get a job. 'I thought, that's what I need, it's
because I haven't got the right skills that I'm having such a hard time',
she said. Soon after that she found a job. Ms Blackwood illustrates the fact
that, while training can be part of the solution, it is no panacea.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Unemployment in the UK: Sharing out the available work may
top the political agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE past 20 years have proved anything, it is that there are no simple,
cheap solutions to high unemployment.
Yet there are some relatively low-cost options which could soon be on the
agenda. One idea is to spread the available work more evenly across the
whole population. Another is to overhaul the benefit system to make it more
employment-friendly. A third involves limited subsidies to induce employers
to take on the long-term jobless.
The 'redistribution' school - which ranges from the women's lobby to those
who believe automation wipes out jobs - argues that unemployment of more
than 2.5m is here to stay, and that the only way of getting more people into
work is to repackage existing working time to include them.
They welcome many of the 1990s trends towards more flexible part-time work,
and want to encourage more job-sharing while discouraging systematic
overtime. More radically, some of them talk of a cultural revolution with
'more men accepting a role as half breadwinner and half house-husband',
according to Ms Anna Coote, a prominent campaigner.
The UK has a higher female participation rate than most other EC countries,
with women taking most of the new, mainly part-time, jobs. Men, says Ms
Coote, may have to be readier to accept 'female' jobs if male unemployment
is to be substantially reduced.
The 1990s could be the decade the redistributionists have been waiting for.
The double-earner household is now the norm, so it is easier for men to work
shorter hours and take a greater role in child-rearing, something they now
seem readier to do. Job sharing and part-time or two-third jobs may also
suit well-paid managerial and professional workers whose jobs are now
threatened for the first time, and who can better afford the trade-off
between work and leisure or family duties.
There is mainstream political support for such ideas. Mr John Smith, the
Labour leader, says he wants a definition of full employment which
'recognises the rights of part-time workers and forges a new balance between
the demands of family life and paid work for both men and women'.
There are plenty of ways to encourage the jobs market to share out work even
more and make sure the unemployed get some of it. The French government tops
up the pay of older workers who give up half their job and covers
administrative costs. Grants to employers for job-splitting and job-sharing,
abandoned in the late 1980s, should also be restored.
Making the benefit system more employment friendly could help. It is
difficult for the Employment Service to help people to help themselves back
into paid employment because of social security rules which assume that most
of the jobless are work-shy.
Income support, the most important benefit for the unemployed, has an
'actively seeking work' rule which precludes more than 16 hours paid work
per week or 21 hours of formal education, and can prevent people working for
nothing in the voluntary sector. The government seems ready to relax some of
these rules.
Just as important would be raising the threshold of what the unemployed can
legitimately earn, and removing the 'mortgage trap'. For the first two years
on income support people are allowed to earn only Pounds 5 before having
every pound earned clawed back through reduced benefit. That is raised to
Pounds 15 after two years. but is still not much of an inducement to
small-scale self-help.
If an unemployed person, or someone in their household, takes part-time work
over the hours threshold it can lead to the withdrawal of mortgage interest
payment, which takes 16 weeks to reinstate if you then lose the job. The
main in-work benefit for the low-paid - family credit - pays rent but not
mortgages.
The best way to get a new job is to have one already, but Ms Ruth Wharton, a
single parent from Cumbria, complains: 'You can't risk coming off income
support in the hope that a part-time job might turn into a full-time one.'
To make it easier for people such as Ruth reformers propose raising the
working hours threshold to 20 hours and the weekly earnings threshold to
about Pounds 40 (plus more flexibility for allowances to be 'rolled up' to
promote seasonal work).
Would that simply mean part-time workers on benefit taking jobs from
part-time workers not on benefit? It might, but Dr Eithne McLaughlin of
Queen's University, Belfast, is convinced from her work with the unemployed
that many would go out and create new work, mainly in the household service
sector.
Subsidising the employment of the long-term jobless is the most traditional
idea. Job subsidies have been rejected in the recent past because they are
too indiscriminate - too many of the 7m who will take new jobs this year
would attract unnecessary subsidy - or too expensive. But if employers could
waive national insurance payments for new recruits who had been jobless for
18 months it would be easy to implement and cost-effective.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Unemployment in the UK: What to do if it happens to you
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How long will it take to get another job and how will I find it?
Two thirds of all unemployed people get a new job within six months. Of more
immediate use - although scarcely more reassuring - is the fact that new
jobs are not to be found in the most obvious places.
For executives, typically earning more than Pounds 30,000 a year, answering
job advertisements is likely to net a job in just 20 per cent of cases.
Approaches to headhunters score 10 per cent, while mail shots to companies
will do more for the Post Office's revenue - just 5 per cent of jobs are
landed by this method.
The most effective method is to network: half of executives who get back
into work do it through networking, according to outplacement consultants
Drake Beam Morin (DBM).
What is networking?
The first rule is not to blow your best contacts while you're feeling
shattered - wait until you have regained your equilibrium. You are not
asking those you network for a job but, as Mrs Michele Cozzi from DBM
explains, co-opting them to help with your research.
For example: 'I understand from our mutual friend Fred Bloggs that you're
very knowledgeable about the current state of the widget market. Would you
be able to spare me a few minutes over a coffee . . . ?' The objective of
the phone call is to set up a face-to-face meeting; the purpose of the
meeting is to come away with the names of two or three other people you can
network - plus permission to use your latest contact's name.
It's so long since I've had to write a CV. What's the style?
It needs to be professionally presented, just two pages if possible, and
clear and factual. Do not include salary details unless requested because
you could close off options.
Reverse chronological order, focusing on the past 10 years, is preferable.
You can organise a CV by function, for example sales experience or
management skills, but doing it this way could arouse suspicions. An
employer may think you are concealing your age or that you have been
job-hopping.
Where do I start?
With practicalities. Go to the Jobcentre to sign on. Unemployment benefit is
Pounds 43.10 for a single person, Pounds 26 extra for an adult dependant.
Even if you are not eligible for benefit (most people are - it is not
means-tested) you will get National Insurance credits. You may also be
eligible for other benefits and help with mortgage interest payments.
Towry Law, financial advisers, recommends alerting your bank, mortgage
lender, and education authority if you have children at college and also
compiling a budget.

decline

Wolverhampton: long-term unemployment - short-term thinking Lewes: painful
attrition in the south-eastMidlands Correspondent
WOLVERHAMPTON is a symbol of the nation's industrial decline. It ran into
trouble in the 1970s and the recession of the 80s dealt its economy a blow
from which it has not recovered. The recession of the 90s is akin to
stopping a baby's feed when the milk bottle is half full: the baby survives,
but miserably.
The unemployment rate in the town is nearly 16 per cent. As many as a third
of males in some inner city areas are out of a job. 'In under 20 years we
have gone from full employment to the worst area of the west Midlands in
terms of unemployment,' says Mr Dennis Turner, Labour MP for Wolverhampton
South East.
Twenty years ago, civic leaders complained that 'national policy on the
location of industry continues to leave this important industrial area
without its second-generation metal using and forming industries, and
appears to deny it growth of almost any sort.'
That chicken came home to roost in the late 1970s. In the eight years to
1986, manufacturing industry shed 20,000 jobs. In autumn 1986, when the
national economy was experiencing high growth, unemployment in Wolverhampton
was above 20 per cent. In 1978 there were 20 companies with more than 500
employees. By 1989 there were only nine.
Mrs Gillian Shepherd, the employment secretary, said last weekend that two
out of every three people now losing their jobs were back at work within six
months. In Wolverhampton, the proportion out of work for longer than a year
was more than 40 per cent.
The Rev Michael Godfrey, an Anglican industrial chaplain, is one of those
trying to pick up the pieces. He is attempting to keep open the Cannon
Industries' fires and cookers plant. The company, part of the GEC group,
wants to close its local plant and consolidate production at Stoke-on-Trent.
'Every young person you speak to has had a period of unemployment, and they
just take it,' he says. 'Unemployment shifts the attitude of loyalty and
community because they don't have any to a particular employer. People just
think short-term.'
There is, he suggests, a 'great survival mentality' which comes out in 'the
sheer determination to hold on if you do have a job, and this is what I
detect at Cannon'.
Expectations are narrowing, leading to what Mr Andy Flockhart, deputy chief
executive of Wolverhampton borough council, calls the key structural problem
 -'a low skills level, low aspirations and the loss of semi-skilled jobs'.
A third of the town's employment is in manufacturing, still higher than the
national average. 'While this has contracted from 40 per cent, our services
sector has not been growing to take up the slack,' Mr Flockhart says.
The civic vision is of Wolverhampton as 'the biggest and most prosperous
centre between Birmingham and Manchester,' according to Mr Bill Clarke, the
Conservative council leader.
Its service sector would be enhanced by redevelopment of the Molineux
football ground and the Dunstall Park racecourse. Its manufacturing base
would be strengthened by the creation of a science park linking the local
university to engineering leaders such as GKN Technology, Goodyear, IMI and
Lucas Aerospace.
Such plans, in the face of two decades of decline, have been slow in
emerging. Mr Turner put that down partly to 'the general reluctance of
government to see local authorities playing any real part in the
regeneration of industrial communities.' Mr Clarke believes that 'the view
has taken root across political parties in Wolverhampton that, unless there
is a joint approach, development will not take place'.
Either way development will be slow. 'People don't use the word 'hope','
says Mr Godfrey. Yet many feel that Wolverhampton could do more to help
itself. Services for the unemployed such as training are 'fragmented', says
the local Training and Enterprise Council.
'We have commissioned research to see what is being done by the myriad of
services to co-ordinate things better,' says a Tec official. 'Our resources
are not as well used as they could be,' comments Mr Turner. 'There is a
crying need for greater co-ordination.'
Yet, while the biggest fillip would be industrial growth in an expanding
economy, civic leaders believe that, to nurture green shoots in brown
fields, they need the extra watering which could come from more government
funding and more European Community cash.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Unemployment in the UK: The man fighting to survive in
Sussex

<TEXT>
'I'M 48, married, I have three children at school, a mortgage and a
profession I cannot use. At my age I sometimes wonder whether I will ever
work again.'
Sitting in the back room of his home, the old toll cottage on the Lewes to
Uckfield Road, Mr Christopher Coomber reflects.
Three years ago he was senior architect at McCarthy and Stone in Eastbourne;
one day between jobs in the 1960s was the extent of his experience of
unemployment.
He is not alone. Lewes, the county town of East Sussex, has bustled its way
through previous economic slowdowns, cushioned by jobs in local government,
Sussex University, and the affluence that naturally gravitates towards the
pretty market town. But this time it has suffered along with the rest of the
country.
'I suppose it's a better-quality unemployment you get here,' shrugs Mr John
Crawford, chief executive of Lewes District Council, peering over an aerial
view of the South Downs which shows the town clumped in the middle.
'When I came to Lewes I thought nothing would ever touch its economy. I
thought it was so strong with the law courts, County Hall, and the fact that
the retailers enjoyed a very established market. But I would revise that
opinion now.'
The town has not been the victim of headline-grabbing redundancies. Instead
it has suffered from the gradual attrition of a once stable employment base,
resulting in one in 10 people out of work. 'It has been a few here and a few
there,' says Ms Madeleine Mayhew, a reporter on the Sussex Express.
Unemployment hit Christopher Coomber hard; first the dog and then the family
felt the brunt of his quickening temper. Money, he says, was one reason.
'The subs for the my children's scouts are Pounds 10 a term - and when I
look at the Scoutmaster smiling and asking if I can pay next week, it really
hurts.'
At times even now the pressure gets too much. Then Christopher is to be
found walking out across the fields behind his house, smoking cigarettes he
can't afford. 'I think back to what I was earning, and how I thought that
wasn't enough. And now I have nothing.'
Meanwhile he has lost touch with his profession. 'I have lost interest in
what is happening, and the gossip. I used to be in contact with what other
people were doing, but I have dropped out and don't really care any more.'
East Sussex County Council's figures show that unemployment in the Lewes
district - which includes Newhaven and Seaford - rose by 37.6 per cent last
year, while Ms Mayhew reports that Stena, the ferry operators in Newhaven,
received more than 400 applications for one recently advertised clerical
post.
Wealthy commuters living in Lewes's surrounding villages have lost jobs, and
virtually all have seen the value of their homes tumble. This has put
pressure on local retailers.
'The high street is all charity shops, banks and building societies - the
kiss of death,' says Mr Rudi Simmonds, president of the Lewes Chamber of
Commerce. 'Lewes is fed by its hinterland, by the people who make their
money in London. But they are drawing in their horns.'
The quiet crisis has compelled the district council to produce an economic
development strategy. But the council knows its limitations and is aware
that it cannot compete against other areas in East Sussex for increasingly
tight government funds.
'We are trying to break through the perception that everything must be all
right because it is the south-east, says Mr Robin Beechey, chief executive
of the county council.
Already the county has the lowest average wages in the south-east. The fact
that more than 75 per cent of companies in East Sussex employ 10 people or
fewer has made the region particularly vulnerable to this recession.
Mr Brian Renville at the Lewes Jobcentre says he has seen everyone from
accountants, systems analysts and engineers, as well as unskilled workers
join
the ranks of people like Mr Coomber, who at the age of 48 is considering
retraining even though the prospect is daunting. 'I am thinking of doing
anything at all, because in another 10 years I am going to go nowhere,' he
says.
Ms Sarah Jay, 36, did decide to retrain. She enrolled on a degree course in
urban planning at Sussex University before redundancy hit her post as a
financial supervisor at Clothkits Lewes headquarters. But seven months since
graduation and 15 job applications later she has had no luck.
'The probability of finding a job in local government did not seem
unrealistic when I started the degree,' she says.
Even when the national economy picks up some fear that Lewes will lag behind
the rest of the country. An export-led recovery would make little impact on
a county where only 14 per cent of the workforce is in manufacturing - the
lowest percentage for any county in England.
For Lewes's unemployed there can be poignant moments. Mr Coomber's
father-in-law was so concerned that the family was cold that he bought them
a hundredweight of coal for Christmas. 'You say 'Thank you, God', because
you know you just can't afford it.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / Unemployment in the UK: A scar that will persist for years
to come - Britain faces the certainty of 3m unemployed. If the figure is not
reached today, it soon will be. More chilling is the fact that the total
will remain high after economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF unemployment does not pass 3m in today's headline figures it will next
month. The prospect of another year of sluggish growth means the jobless
total will grow well into next year.
Yet the attention-grabbing fall and rise in the level of unemployment over
the last few years obscures the more chilling feature of Britain's record:
the rising level of unemployment that persists whether the economy is in
recession or growing fast.
While the pace and timing of the recovery is hotly disputed, no City
economists expects unemployment to return to pre-1970s days when fewer than
1m were out of work:
Optimists such as Mr Kevin Gardiner at SG Warburg Securities expect
unemployment to peak at 3.2m in the fourth quarter of this year and to fall
below 3m in early 1995.
Pessimists such as Mr Gerard Lyons of DKB International expect a sickly
recovery to push unemployment to a peak of 3.6m in 1995 and keep it above 3m
throughout the next decade. Either way painfully high unemployment levels
are here to stay for years.
Why is the underlying level of unemployment so much higher today than 20
years ago? Britain's repeated rollercoaster rides between boom and recession
make it tempting to blame government mismanagement for persistently high
unemployment, especially after three wrenching recessions in fewer than two
decades.
But while the UK has had much deeper recessions than its European
counterparts, it is not alone in being dogged by persistently high and
rising unemployment, even though the rise in continental European
unemployment may have occurred less spasmodically.
Britain's unemployment rate has risen by more than that in any other member
of the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries over the past two
years.
However,a the rate started rising from a lower level than in most of the
country's European counterparts, and is even now barely above that in
recession-bound France.
The standard explanations for persistently high unemployment - powerful
trade unions, generous unemployment benefits or an immobile workforce - do
not fit well with Britain's 1980s experience.
The Thatcher government deregulated the labour market, making it easier to
hire and fire workers, and encouraged a large rise in female employment; it
saw trade union membership fall and the number of strikes decline; it cut
the level of unemployment benefits relative to average wages; and more
workers than ever before bought their houses and moved between regions.
Yet at the peak of the late 1980s boom, when skilled and unskilled vacancies
across the country had recovered to their levels of the late 1970s,
unemployment remained higher than in any other post-war decade.
The explanation lies in the attributes and the aspirations of the unemployed
themselves. Technological change and competition from low-cost producers in
developing countries has reduced the demand for unskilled labour other than
in low wage, often part-time employment. These jobs, often in the service
sector, have been mainly taken by female entrants into the labour market.
Meanwhile, the demand for the services of unskilled men has collapsed, at
least at wages they are willing to accept. Most of the long-term unemployed
in the 1980s were male, lived and worked in the industrial heartlands of the
north of England and had no educational qualifications.
Many of these men have slipped off the unemployment count and are now
officially counted as economically inactive.
The mythology of the current recession suggests that this time round it is
architects, lawyers and other middle-class professionals in the south-east
who are suffering. But this a misleading caricature.
Like all myths, there is some element of truth behind it. Unemployment has
risen much faster in the south than in the north and has hit
mortgage-holders harder than people who live in rented accommodation.
Unemployment rates for professional workers have risen, while they barely
changed in the 1980-81 recession; and unemployment rates have risen for all
groups, regardless of educational qualifications. The fear of unemployment
among professional and indebted home-owners is also partly to blame for the
lack of recovery.
Yet the professions and service sectors have not taken the brunt of this
recession. Employment in service industries has fallen by a little under
500,000 since the recession began, but manufacturing employment has fallen
by over 700,000. The unemployment rate for people who worked in
manufacturing has risen by 5.8 percentage points since 1989 compared with
2.4 percentage points in banking and finance. Unemployment rates have risen
much faster for men and young people than women, and for people in unskilled
blue or white-collar occupations than professionals.
The recession is spreading the effect of falling demand for low skill labour
to the south and to the service sector. Even when recovery comes, many of
these lost jobs will only return at increasingly low wages. It is the poorly
educated, not the frightened middle classes, who will still be bearing the
brunt when this recession is just a painful memory.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown signals shift in economic
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN yesterday shifted decisively the ground on which Labour will
formulate its economic strategy by stressing that the advancement of
individual opportunity would lie at the heart of its plans for economic
regeneration.
Confirming his party's determination to drop the tax and spending policies
judged to have cost it the last election, Mr Brown argued that economic and
industrial modernisation could only be achieved by advancing individual
opportunity.
In an attempt to sideline past Conservative attacks on Labour's tax plans
and to defuse internal party debates about the respective roles of the
public and private sector, the shadow chancellor unveiled what he termed
'the new economics of individual potential'.
Mr Brown, whose strategy was endorsed earlier this week by the shadow
cabinet, said Britain's relative economic decline could not be attributed to
governments choosing the wrong exchange or interest rates or spending and
borrowing too much or too little. 'The real problem is our limited capacity
for sustainable economic growth which in turn arises from a failure to
invest in the future of Britain and in individual potential,' he said.
He said Labour's approach would from now on be guided by the principle that
the main enemy of growth is 'simply the failure to employ the skills
energies and talents of the people'.
Against that background, Labour should approach tax and spending without 'a
prior disposition in favour of either,' he argued.
'We are not against wealth. We are against poverty and the unfair waste of
individual potential'.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith rallies party over Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, succeeded yesterday in rallying most
Labour MPs around a strategy of not backing 'wrecking' amendments to
Maastricht.
The move will help the government ratify the treaty. But Mr Smith reiterated
to Labour MPs his determination to continue pushing for implementation of
the social chapter. He said he was not convinced by the government's legal
verdict that Labour's amendment 27 on the chapter could be ignored if
passed.
Meanwhile, the government has decided that either the attorney-general or
solicitor-general will be 'on call' whenever the Maastricht bill is debated
by MPs.
The decision follows the embarrassing U-turn on Monday when Mr Douglas Hurd,
foreign secretary, told MPs that earlier Foreign Office legal advice had
been wrong.
Last night, Mr Hurd warned Tory backbenchers that if Britain did not ratify
Maastricht, it risked losing influence at the United Nations and in the US,
as well as in Europe. But he met some anxiety among Tories that the latest
legal advice might not stand up to its likely probing.
Mr Smith's test came when Euro-sceptic Labour MPs tried to get a pledge that
a Labour amendment opposing the European Central Bank would be pushed to a
Commons vote. If passed, the amendment would wreck the bill.
Mr Smith said the issue was a 'straight political question' - whether Labour
wanted to reject Maastricht or build on the treaty. He backed greater
accountability of the proposed bank but said there would have to be
compromises.
He cited the conference decision last year that Maastricht was 'the best
agreement that can currently be achieved.' A leadership amendment backing
the official line was passed by 112 votes to 46. The central bank amendment
will be withdrawn after debate.
The leadership will not say how it will instruct its MPs to vote when the
bill reaches its third reading - the final Commons stage. Several shadow
cabinet members say Labour should abstain if the social chapter is not
incorporated.
Severe criticism of the government's handling of Maastricht was voiced on
both sides of the Lords as peers debated Europe yesterday. The Tory attack
was led by Lord Ridley, a former cabinet minister.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Harsh realities for Labour -
Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RANK and file of the Conservative party were described by Mr John Smith
this week as unsettled, uncertain and potentially rebellious. Fresh from his
latest man-oeuvring over Maastricht, it is a judgment with which Mr John
Major would find it hard to disagree.
Mr Smith's problem is that the prime minister could apply the same
description to MPs on the Labour benches. The Tories have emerged battered
and bewildered from the horrors of the past few months. Their opponents
appear equally unsettled by their failure to reap the political rewards.
For what they are worth, the opinion polls confirm that popular
disenchantment with the government has yet to translate into solid
enthusiasm for the official opposition. Ten months in to the new parliament
many Labour MPs - particularly among the newcomers - are beginning to learn
that the fun of political point-scoring provides a strictly temporary
diversion from the harsher realities of opposition.
The party's so-called modernisers and their traditionalist enemies have
abandoned for now the synthetic dispute over what should be learnt from Mr
Bill Clinton's election victory. Mr Clinton's decision to renege on his
pre-election tax pledges should dim the adolescent enthusiasm of those who
imagined the Democrats had rediscovered the holy grail of centre-left
politics.
The group reviewing Labour's links with the unions has come up with a
classic fudge worthy of the infamous smoke-filled rooms in which policy was
made in the 1960s. Its list of options should pave the way for
one-member-one-vote elections for party leader and for parliamentary
candidates. But the unions will retain a powerful and visible presence at
annual conference.
Neither development has lifted the party's MPs. Between the advocates of
radical change and the defenders of a romanticised past is a broad swathe
who have lost past certainties but found nothing to replace them. Mr Smith
has yet to fill the vacuum. The party lacks any sense of excitement.
The inevitable tensions between opportunism and the more arduous task of
framing credible alternative policies re-emerged during yesterday's debate
in the PLP on Maastricht. Mr Smith was decisive. Yet the episode reinforced
the demands of those who want his leadership to be consistently stronger.
The modernisers - represented notably by Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown
but joined recently by Mr Jack Straw - believe that Mr Smith took a step in
that direction in his Bournemouth speech earlier this month.
The speech, dismissing the theological disputes over ownership which have
dogged Labour since Mr Hugh Gaitskell's abortive attempt more than 30 years
ago to abolish Clause 4 of the constitution, was over-hyped.
But its importance was that, after months of wavering, Mr Smith put himself
on the side of those who believe that Labour must change before it can win.
On one level he provided a framework for the party to replace reflex
interventionism with the concept of a state which supports rather than
frustrates personal ambition. Mr Blair has been adamant that Labour can move
nowhere until it projects with clarity an ideology in which the community is
seen as a buttress to individual aspiration.
More practically, commitments on taxation, public spending, nationalisation
can now be rewritten or dropped. Mr Brown moved further along that road
yesterday with his disavowal of tax increases for the middle classes.
Mr Smith though is more cautious than his lieutenants; and his caution is
obscuring the process of change. He is resiting calls for the decisive break
with the unions sought by Mr Blair. His aides say they cannot risk offending
the paymasters. Nor will he seek to abolish Clause 4, arguing that its
importance is symbolic.
But symbolism may be more powerful than Mr Smith is prepared to admit. The
changes being wrought by Messrs Blair and Brown are important. But a
sceptical electorate is unlikely to be convinced by statements of
philosophical intent. It may continue to judge Labour on the television
images of trades unions casting millions of votes at party conference.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Institute advances 'opt-out'
pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT could allow people to 'contract out' of the basic state
pension without breaking its manifesto pledges, the free-market Adam Smith
Institute says today, Ralph Atkins writes.
Setting out plans for extending the government's privatisation programme,
the institute says the state pension is poor value for many people.
It also calls for greater choice when council services are privatised. The
institute says, as an example, that contracts for refuse collection could be
given to two companies - with each paid according to how many local people
chose their service.
Citizens, not just local authorities, would then be making decisions about
services, the think tank argues.
The report comes as the government embarks on its wide-ranging review of
public spending. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has said no
areas are sacred, but has promised to honour 1992 election pledges.
On pensions the Tory manifesto said: 'The basic state retirement pension
will remain the foundation for retirement.' But the institute says the basic
state pension could remain for those who did not want to provide their own,
so its proposals would 'in no way contradict the government's manifesto
pledge'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF executive of Mirror Group Newspapers, Mr David Montgomery, last
night faced a storm of criticism from Labour MPs following this week's
resignation from the Daily Mirror of Mr Alastair Campbell, its political
editor.
Mr Neil Kinnock and Mr Roy Hattersley, the former leader and deputy leader
of the party, tabled a Commons motion deploring the actions which 'forced'
his departure.
As senior Labour officials voiced fears that Mr Montgomery was set on
abandoning MGN's traditional support for Labour, more than 150 of the
party's MPs signed the motion.
Noting that other changes instituted by Mr Montgomery had jeopardised the
newspaper's 'traditionally high standards of journalism' and 'its
independence from Conservative politics', the MPs said they had no
confidence in him as chief executive.
Mr Montgomery insisted that the paper had no plans to change its traditional
allegiance to Labour.
But officials close to Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, said that there
were now severe strains between Mr Montgomery and Lord Hollick, the Labour
peer and MGN board member behind his orginal appointment last October.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Dorrell defends project funds plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's policy of increasing the involvement of private finance in
public projects is a long-term supply-side reform and not 'creative
accounting', Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said
yesterday.
He told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee that the plans were
a part of a long-term policy shift which aimed to see the government as an
enabler, motivator and purchaser - rather than supplier - of services.
Involving the private sector more in public projects was motivated by a wish
to bring private-sector management skills and capital to the public sector.
He rejected suggestions from MPs that the scheme was intended primarily to
ease the public sector borrowing requirement, which the government has
forecast will reach Pounds 37bn in 1992-93.
Mr Dorrell said the new policy should increase overall infrastructure
investment because investment by the private sector in public projects would
no longer lead to corresponding reductions in government spending plans.
The minister said Mr Kingsley Jones, a Treasury official, has been appointed
to co-ordinate the initiative and said companies with questions about the
scheme should contact him at the Treasury.
Mr Dorrell also announced revised guidance procedures to increase the amount
of contracting out of energy management by the public sector.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont legal bill sparks review
call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL chapter in the parliamentary saga of Mr Norman Lamont's legal bill
was written yesterday as the Commons public accounts committee called for a
review of government rules on using public funds for ministers' personal
expenses.
The cross-party spending watchdog regretted that the Treasury had not
highlighted in its accounts the decision to pay Pounds 4,700 towards the
Pounds 22,000 costs of evicting an unwanted tenant from the chancellor's
private home.
Treasury officials said in evidence to the committee that the decision was
so clearly within the rules that there was no particular need to raise it.
But, drawing on officials' own words, the committee said: 'The fact that the
decision was given 'exceptionally rigorous high-level consideration', and
the fact that Sir Terence Burns (the Treasury permanent secretary)
acknowledged that others may have made a different decision, suggests that
to follow Treasury guidance to err on the side of notation rather than of
omission would have been the wiser course of action'.
The MPs recommend that the review of the rules should produce clear guidance
to officials and ministers about the use and disclosure of public resources
for ministers' non-official expenses, and emphasise the presumption against
using public funds.
While the committee makes clear that it is not concerned with Mr Lamont's
conduct, it notes in the report that it 'remains for ministers to decide
whether or not to allow such payments to be made'.
The report comes the day after Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, was
rebuked by another Commons committee for not declaring work on his garden
that was paid by a food company.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Retreat on taxing foreign companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has had to execute an embarrassing climbdown in his
claim that foreign-owned companies could be made to pay billions of dollars
more in US taxes.
In his campaign manifesto, Mr Clinton said that making foreign companies pay
their fair share of taxes by stricter enforcement of the transfer pricing
rules that govern transactions between subsidiaries and their parents would
bring in Dollars 45bn in four years from 1993 to 1996 - the second largest
source of savings identified in the document.
This number was less extravagant than the estimate of Dollars 30bn a year
that commonly circulates in congressional subcommittees, but it was still
widely ridiculed.
Last night's economic package, more modestly, estimates only Dollars 1.8bn
over the same 1993-96 period, or a total of Dollars 3.8bn over a longer
six-year period from an initiative to enhance penalties on transfer pricing
abuses. Even this estimate appears to involve a good deal of guesswork; this
line contains far the roundest numbers in the entire Treasury document
detailing the new tax increases.
A Treasury official said the tighter enforcement would involve penalties
that may be levied when a company is found to have cheated on transfer
pricing arrangements. Companies must have contemporaneous documents
justifying their pricing structure, instead of being able to construct post
hoc justifications.
At the same time, the Treasury plans to increase compliance with transfer
pricing rules by spending Dollars 38m on more tax inspectors and doubling
the frequency with which foreign companies are audited, and an official said
the additional revenue from this enforcement drive, while as yet
uncalculated, would be large.
A second measure in the Clinton package will also affect some foreign
companies: earnings stripping rules, designed to prevent companies from
converting taxable dividends into tax deductible debt repayments by lending
money to their subsidiaries for capital, will be tightened to cover bank
loans guaranteed by the parent company. The administration estimates this
could bring in Dollars 579m over the 1993-98 period.
More significant revenue, however, could come from measures aimed at US
multinationals with foreign subsidiaries. By reforming the foreign tax
credit for oil multinationals, including royalties in the passive basket of
the foreign tax credit, and stopping deferral for excessive accumulated
foreign earnings, the Treasury hopes to reap Dollars 4.3bn in the 1993-98
period.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Burden falls mainly on the affluent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PROMINENT feature of President Clinton's economic plan was a set of
'burden' tables showing that affluent families will bear the lion's share of
tax increases.
Families with taxable incomes of Dollars 140,000 or more will face a new top
income tax rate of 36 per cent, against 31 per cent under President Bush. A
10 per cent surcharge will be applied to taxable incomes in excess of
Dollars 250,000, resulting in an effective top marginal rate of almost 40
per cent.
These measures are expected to raise an extra Dollars 27.7bn in fiscal 1994
(which begins this September) and a total of Dollars 126.3bn by fiscal 1998.
Officials said the new 36 per cent band would apply only to the top 1-2 per
cent of taxpayers; 85 per cent of those affected by the surcharge would have
assets in excess of Dollars 1m, making it effectively a levy on
millionaires.
Affluent families will be hit by a range of other 'fairness' measures.
Employee and employer contributions towards Medicare, the federal scheme for
the elderly, will be levied on all earnings, rather than only earnings up to
a limit of Dollars 135,000 a year. This will raise Dollars 2.7bn next fiscal
year and a total of Dollars 29.2bn by fiscal 1998.
Executive pay in excess of Dollars 1m a year will no longer be tax
deductible. And only 50 per cent, rather than 80 per cent of the cost of
business meals and entertainment, will be tax deductible under the plan.
These measures will raise nearly Dollars 17bn by fiscal 1998.
The affluent elderly will also have to pay higher taxes on their social
security (federal pension) benefits.
If enacted such measures will have a significant impact on the distribution
of the US tax burden. For families with annual incomes of Dollars 200,000 or
more federal taxes as a percentage of pre-tax incomes will rise 2.9
percentage points to 23.8 per cent. For families with incomes of Dollars
100,000 a year or more, the ratio will rise 0.9 points to 21.8 per cent.
For the poorest families, with incomes of Dollars 10,000 or less, federal
taxes will decline 0.2 percentage points as a percentage of pre-tax incomes
to 7.6 per cent. Increases for families with incomes of Dollars 30,000 or
less will be negligible.
If the impact of spending changes, which favour low- income groups, is taken
into account the plan is skewed even more decisively in favour of poor
families. If nothing else Mr Clinton could yesterday claim to have delivered
on his campaign promise to reverse the fiscal policies of the 1980s which
had favoured affluent Americans.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Betrayed Franco puts boot into Brazil's lumbering state
sector: Indebted and inefficient, public companies have lost the president's
backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Brazilian President Itamar Franco assumed office last year one of
his first complaints was that the use of an elephant to symbolise the state
in the campaign for privatisation was 'derogatory' to such a valiant sector.
Not only did he suspend the elephant but the entire privatisation programme.
Mr Franco's rose-tinted view has since been clouded by the discovery of the
sector's drain on the exchequer. The state sector now holds almost as much
debt as Brazil's entire foreign debt. Its arrears on taxes and social
security contributions amount to Dollars 8.7bn (Pounds 6.1bn) - more than
the government is struggling to raise through its proposed fiscal reform.
Already this year the central bank has provided Dollars 400m to enable state
companies to keep up payments to international creditors.
Saying he feels 'betrayed' by state companies and 'their intolerable
privileges', this week Mr Franco ordered an investigation into their
activities and slashed salaries of directors by as much as half. Legislation
is awaiting Senate approval to allow parastatals to be declared bankrupt and
Mr Franco says he may review the monopoly status of some.
As a result of an intensive state-led development programme begun in the
1950s to make the country self-sufficient, Brazil has 159 state companies
involved in everything from gold-mining, oil, aerospace and shipping to
manufacturing of computers, steel and fertilisers, and employing 730,000
workers.
This year state companies are projected to lose Dollars 5bn through waste
and inefficiency, spend Dollars 6bn servicing debt of Dollars 93.3bn, and
take out of the budget Dollars 8bn for investment. In return they will pay
back Dollars 10bn in taxes, leaving a net drain of Dollars 9bn. Mr Joel
Korn, president of Bank of America in Brazil, says 'this is the real cause
of inflation'.
While Mr Franco may have ideological objections to selling off these
companies, he wants to stop them bleeding the economy. To the alarm of the
company presidents, he is refusing to authorise the traditional monthly
inflation-plus adjustments in tariffs without cost plans. Even Petrobras,
the usually sacrosanct state oil company, is to undergo an audit.
Unravelling the finances of state companies is not an easy task. Not only
are their costs often a mystery but a huge web has been created of
interlinking debts.
According to Economy Ministry figures, the champion debtor is the electrical
sector. Eletrobras, the holding company with assets of Dollars 36bn, owes
Dollars 59.2bn including the debt on Itaipu, the world's largest
hydroelectric project, and has arrears of Dollars 12.4bn against projected
profits this year of just Dollars 100m-Dollars 500m.
More than half the state sector debt is in foreign and domestic bank loans
and multilateral financing. A further Dollars 18.9bn is in debentures issued
over the last decade to capitalise holdings. Another Dollars 2.9bn is owed
to suppliers and construction groups.
Many state companies would have been declared bankrupt long ago had they
been in private hands and, if the new legislation is approved, several may
not be long for this world. Favourite candidates are Cosipa, a steel mill,
which has overdue debt of Dollars 1.1bn - equal to its yearly revenue and
needs Dollars 300m to pay suppliers, and Lloyd, the paralysed state shipping
company, which retains 1,100 workers for just two ships and last year lost
Dollars 65m.
Seven out of 10 parastatals are inefficient, according to Mr Jose Manoel
Goncalves de Oliveira who recently co-ordinated a 1,400-page study on
Brazil's infrastructure for the Electrical Association. In the energy
sector, for example, Brazil needs five times as many people as Canada to
produce three times less energy.
The telephone service, it says, is 'falling from third to fourth world
levels' with 24 out of 100 calls not connecting. Brazilian ports are the
least efficient in the world with costs of Dollars 15 to load a tonne of
soya compared to Dollars 2 in the US and Dollars 4 in neighbouring
Argentina. 'How can a country think about being competitive internationally
with these conditions?' asks Mr Goncalves.
However, state companies' directors claim that, had they not been state-run,
they would not be in this situation. They point out that successive
governments have kept public sector tariffs artificially low to suppress
inflation and have constantly meddled with directors for political or even
corrupt ends.
Petrobras has had seven presidents in the last three years. Directors of the
National Steel Company complain that the bureaucratic straitjacket of the
state has denied them the flexibility to compete with recently privatised
Usiminas. The government cash crisis has also blocked desperately needed
investment.
Privatisation would seem the obvious answer, but for Mr Franco's belief that
there is something inherently wrong with selling off state assets. His
decree on privatisation issued last month gave him imperial powers over the
process and investors have not been optimistic that the programme will
restart as promised next month.
However, there are signs Mr Franco may be changing his mind. He said this
week: 'The concept of a state enterprise that I defend is one that serves
the interests of the state and not of interest groups.'
He left little doubt on which category he thinks Brazilian parastatals
belong to.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Canada warned on government borrowing risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN economists have warned that foreign investors are nearing the limit
of their willingness to satisfy increasingly heavy borrowing by the federal
government and 10 provinces.
In one of the biggest recent borrowing onslaughts, Ottawa and the provinces
have flooded domestic and international markets with new debt issues to
finance soaring budget deficits.
Growing Canadian public-sector debt has been reflected in a widening gap
between Canadian and US interest rates, and bond yields, in the last six
months and, more recently, in increased volatility of the Canadian dollar.
The risks were outlined in a report by the CD Howe Institute of Toronto, a
leading economic think-tank, following a recent seminar attended by 20
economists, most of them employed by banks and securities firms.
Mr Ed Neufeld, chief economist of the Royal Bank of Canada, said that
finance ministers should distinguish between short-term cyclical budget
deficits and 'structural issues'.
The economists urged measures to improve fiscal imbalances, ranging from
deep cuts in transfer payments to the provinces to the elimination of
overlapping government services. However, they had little enthusiasm for
large tax increases.
The warning coincides with growing political awareness of the risks posed by
fast-growing budget deficits, especially in the provinces. Tax increases and
public-spending cuts are expected to be a feature of the spring budget
season.
The provinces raised more than CDollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in debt in
January, including a CDollars 3bn global Euromarkets issue by Ontario.
Quebec earlier this week raised CDollars 1.4bn in its first global offering.
The recession has badly dented tax revenues at all levels of government and
put heavier demands on Canada's generous social security system.
Mr Donald Mazankowksi, finance minister, last December revised the federal
government's 1992-1993 budget deficit upwards from CDollars 27.5bn to
CDollars 34.4bn. Ontario's shortfall is now projected at almost CDollars
11bn, three times the level two years ago.
The combined debt of Ottawa and the provinces has soared from CDollars 50bn,
or 29 per cent of gross domestic product, in 1975, to CDollars 665bn, or 96
per cent of GDP. Canada's foreign debt-service burden relative to the size
of its economy is now higher than that of Chile and Venezuela, and
approaching the levels of Brazil and Mexico.
Mr Peter Nicholson, of Bank of Nova Scotia, said: 'There is a limit for
tolerance of even greater Canadian debt in foreign markets. This limit is
likely to be reached suddenly and without a lot of warning.' Other
participants at the seminar said the federal election later this year or
political uncertainty in Quebec might reduce appetite for Canadian loans.
But a government-finance specialist at one Toronto securities firm said
yesterday that there was no sign yet of foreigners shunning Canadian
government debt issues.

Mr Lou Guttman, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, and his former

complaint by the enforcement division of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the futures industry regulator, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago.
The charges are associated with allegedly pre-arranged sugar options trades
made on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in 1989.
Mr Guttman stepped down from Nymex chairmanship in July when the CFTC
notified him civil charges were pending. When no action had been taken by
December, he resumed his post. He is campaigning for a third term.

US HOUSING starts fell 7.2 per cent in January to the lowest level in six
months, the government said yesterday, AP reports from Washington.
Analysts attributed the decline in part to bad weather, but most agreed that
housing growth was likely to slow from last year's pace. Construction
advanced 18.4 per cent in 1992.
Starts rose only in the south in January. The Commerce Department said
construction of new single-family homes and apartments totalled 1.19m at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate in January, down from 1.29m a month earlier.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Americans to pay more for energy: Clinton administration
spells out its economic programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW energy tax levied on the thermal content of fuels will raise net
revenues estimated at Dollars 22bn a year once it is fully in force, US
Treasury officials said yesterday.
The tax will be imposed at a rate of 25.7 cents per million British thermal
units on coal, nuclear energy and gas, and at a much steeper rate of 59.9
cents per million BTUs on oil.
The administration plans to phase in the tax in three stages, charging one
third of the full rate from July 1, 1994, two thirds a year later, and the
full rate from July 1, 1996.
When fully phased in, the tax is expected to add 7.5 cents to the price of a
gallon of petrol, 26.25 cents to a thousand cubic feet of natural gas, and
Dollars 2.25 to the monthly electricity bill of an average household.
Environmentalist groups greeted the details of the new tax with cautious
approval. While many groups have favoured much heavier taxes, or a tax based
directly on carbon content, to discourage consumption of polluting fuels,
some analysts noted that a BTU tax has an advantage over an ad valorem tax
in environmental terms because it hits coal, which is cheaper per BTU than
other fossil fuels, more than some cleaner fuels.
At the same time, by imposing a higher rate on oil President Bill Clinton
could have some effect on fuel consumption in motor vehicles.
The new tax, which will be collected at the pipeline, mine or refinery, is
expected to raise the price of natural gas by 13.5 per cent, of coal by 18
per cent and of oil by 23.6 per cent.
Renewable energy sources will for the most part be excluded from the tax,
although hydroelectric power will be taxed at the average cost of the fossil
fuels used by power generators.
Some groups have argued against the energy tax on the grounds that it hurts
lower income families, but the administration has tried to offset the impact
of the energy tax with increased spending on food stamps and a programme to
subsidise heating bills for low income families, as well as by an expanded
earned income tax credit, again for low income families.
Officials calculate that without these offsets, a family with an income of
Dollars 25,000 a year would spend Dollars 105 a year more for its energy
bills, while a family earning Dollars 40,000 would pay Dollars 118 and a
family earning Dollars 60,000 would pay Dollars 133.
One senior administration official said this would only be a modest burden
on the average American, contrasting the extra cost of around Dollars 10 a
month with the cut in interest rates that has taken place since the
election. That has already yielded savings of Dollars 60 a month on a
Dollars 100,000 mortgage.
Mr Clinton's decision to impose a broad energy tax could have international
implications. Last year, there was some discussion of an international
agreement to levy a carbon tax, but the EC, Japan and the US were unwilling
to commit themselves alone for fear of creating a competitive disadvantage
for their economies.
But Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said yesterday the US decision
would make it easier for EC member states to adopt an energy tax.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Investment stressed while spending cuts are outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPENDING has become a dirty word in Washington. Investment, however, carries
far more positive connotations, especially for a new administration
convinced that one of the worst US structural defects is the investment gap,
as measured against the record of its main foreign competitors.
Matched against that, the administration has sought to come up with credible
attempts to cut spending. The principal targets outlined yesterday are
four-year savings of Dollars 91bn on 'entitlements' (social programmes),
Dollars 76bn on defence and about Dollars 50bn on other discretionary
budgetary items.
President Bill Clinton's proposals divide investment into the short term, to
help create an additional 500,000 permanent and temporary jobs, and the
longer haul, intended to ensure that the human capital in society gets its
due.
Just over Dollars 16bn in extra spending is planned for the current year,
mostly on the public works side. Included, for example, are an extra Dollars
3bn in road building and another Dollars 1bn on other forms of transport,
Dollars 2.5bn in block grants to local communities, Dollars 1bn in summer
youth employment programmes, Dollars 3bn in federal loan authority, Dollars
300m for the mass immunisation programme, and Dollars 845m for waste water
clean-up.
All these proposals build on existing programmes and, according to senior
officials, fall within the discretionary spending totals for the budget of
the current fiscal year, ending in September.
The four-year Dollars 160bn investment plan is much more ambitious in scope
and in its potential demands on the public purse, assuming it meets
congressional approval.
Some Dollars 48bn is earmarked for infrastructural development, including
Dollars 17bn on technology, involving more funding for the National Science
Foundation and assorted government research and development programmes,
Dollars 9.6bn for housing and community initiatives such as enterprise
zones, Dollars 8.4bn on transport, embracing high speed rail and new
investments in mass transit, and Dollars 8bn on the environment.
What is known as 'lifelong learning' is to get Dollars 37.8bn over the four
years, with principal sums going to education reform, worker training, Mr
Clinton's youth national service programmes and continued and full funding
of the Head Start programme for disadvantaged children.
Another Dollars 25bn is destined for 'rewarding work', mostly concerning the
government safety net such as the earned income tax credit and extended
unemployment compensation, but also including extra funds to combat crime.
A further Dollars 26bn is planned for expansion of existing health care
programmes, though this sum is separate from whatever recommendations emerge
from the task force on health care reforms being chaired by Mrs Hillary
Clinton.
Finally, Dollars 24bn is targeted for investment incentives that increase
productivity and jobs. Most of this sum is made up of assorted capital gains
tax relief, and extended investment tax credits.
Many of the above causes are dear to Democrat hearts, though the great
emphasis on private sector investment more reflects President Clinton's
thinking. However, there must be a heavy probability that the mix of
investment plans proposed by the administration will change as Congress goes
to work.
One of the most controversial measures is a proposal to cancel the ambitious
Freedom space station to clear the way for a smaller and cheaper station.
Freedom was first proposed 10 years ago as an Dollars 8bn project; its cost
is now estimated at Dollars 30bn, but many critics charge that its real
lifetime cost could be as much as Dollars 180bn. While many scientists
believe the station has little scientific use, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration has spread the project's construction work around a
great many congressional districts.
Because of termination costs, Mr Clinton will save little money in the short
term, but could achieve significant savings in the longer term.

Crowds took to the streets in the eastern city of Cumana and in Barinas, in

decision to suspend 'temporarily' a repeat of gubernatorial elections,
scheduled for March 14. The results of the original elections, on December 6
last year, were inconclusive.
The army, national guard, and marines took control of the two cities, where
one person was reported killed, scores injured and several hundred arrested.
Clashes continued in Cumana yesterday.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Erosion of support for Canadian Reform party in run-up to
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new element of volatility has entered Canadian politics in the run-up to
this year's general election with a rapid erosion of support for the once
fast-growing Reform party, writes Bernard Simon.
Reform's populist, right-of-centre policies had been expected to drain
considerable support from the ruling Progressive Conservative party,
especially in the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.
Many political observers had predicted that the most likely outcome of the
election, expected in early autumn, would be a minority Conservative
government supported by as many as 30 Reform MPs. Reform currently has only
one MP.
But according to the latest Angus Reid/Southam poll, support for Reform in
Alberta, its stronghold, has halved in the past year to 21 per cent, with a
five-point decline in January.
An Angus Reid official said yesterday that many voters, nervous at the
prospect of a hung parliament, appear to be returning to the three
traditional parties - the Conservatives, Liberals and New Democratic party.
The Liberals, the main opposition party, remain well ahead, with 46 per head
of the decided vote, against 18 per cent for the Conservatives.

JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday strongly hinted that an
income tax cut would not be included in a special package to stimulate the
economy, expected to be announced this spring.
Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the LDP's policy affairs research council
who is co-ordinating the party's plans, said an income tax cut would be
discussed only after a package of stimulative measures has been agreed.
Mr Mitzusuka said the LDP would push ahead with plans for housing-related
tax concessions which would be designed to maintain the momentum of the
rally in house building which has recently shown signs of running out of
steam.
The party would also consider proposals for one-off tax rebates, rather than
cuts in tax rates, Mr Mitsuzuka said. He indicated that the outlines of a
special economic package would be announced as early as April 1, immediately
after the 1993 budget is due to be formally agreed.
Mr Mitsuzuka's comments are the clearest sign yet that the LDP may be
backing away from plans for a straight income tax cut, which is strongly
opposed by the powerful ministry of finance.
The finance ministry believes a tax cut would deliver only a negligible
boost to consumption, while at the same time risking starting a long-term
deterioration in the country's public finances.
The timing of further moves to stimulate Japan's flagging economy has been
complicated because the Y10,700bn (Pounds 62bn) special package announced
last year is still working its way into the country's economy. However, a
recent official survey found that only 5 per cent of companies had felt any
benefits from the package.
About a third of the public works projects including in last year's packages
are unlikely to be started until later this year.
Japan's industrial production fell 1.3 per cent in December from the
previous month, according to revised figures issued by the ministry of trade
and industry. The original figures reported a 1 per cent fall.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Singapore refines its status as an oil centre: Kieran Cooke
reviews the recent and rapid growth of petroleum-related investments
throughout Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week British Petroleum, Caltex and the local Singapore Petroleum
Company announced a SDollars 1.3bn (Dollars 850m) refinery project in
Singapore. This is significant, not just in dollar terms, since the centre
of the world oil market is gravitating towards Asia.
The project was the latest in a long list of petroleum-related investments
by Shell, Mobil, Exxon and others in Singapore. Even at a time when its
balance sheet is dipping into the red, BP is investing about SDollars 380m
in this new facility.
In the west, oil refining and related activities are either stagnating or
declining. In Asia, and particularly in Singapore, they are growing rapidly.
Singapore has become the world's third-biggest refining centre after
Rotterdam and Houston. It now has a refining capacity of slightly over 1m
b/d, supplying almost 40 per cent of Asia's imports of refined products.
Singapore has also become - along with London and New York - one of the
world's three main oil trading centres.
Singapore's geographical position, at the centre of the supply chain from
the Middle East to Asia's main markets in Japan and South Korea, is one
reason for its growth as a petroleum centre but it also benefits from the
rapidly developing economies of southeast Asia.
Oil consumption in the Asia region is now rising by nearly 4 per cent per
year compared with a world average growth of about 0.5 per cent.
While Asia's own oil resources have been developed, the region's demand far
outstrips supply. Only about 44 per cent of Asia's oil needs come from the
region: the rest is imported, mainly from the Middle East.
New oil fields being developed in the region are unlikely to alter this
trend. By the end of the decade, oil analysts estimate that the Asia region
will be consuming nearly 20m b/d compared with 13.8m b/d at present.
China and Indonesia, both big regional producers, expect to become net
importers by the end of the decade. The Gulf war, as well as Asia's fast
economic growth, encouraged the expansion and upgrading programme in
Singapore.
Kuwait had been supplying large amounts of refined products, particularly
gas oil and naphtha, to Asia. Suddenly there were shortages. The war
underlined the fact that Asia had not been investing enough in refineries.
Policies quickly changed: Japan brought mothballed refineries back into
production, increasing refining capacity to nearly 5m b/d, and South Korea
plans to double its refining capacity to 1.6m b/d.
But other less financially endowed countries baulk at the idea of spending
precious financial resources on refineries. A relatively unsophisticated
facility with a capacity of 100,000 b/d now costs between Dollars 1bn and
Dollars 1.5bn.
In 1989 Indonesia announced plans to build nine more oil refineries. So far
only one new refinery is under construction: expansion and upgrading work at
existing plants was recently put on hold due to the introduction of tight
government borrowing policies.
Singapore is in the fortunate position of having an established refining
industry: it is far cheaper to expand and upgrade existing plants than build
new ones. The oil majors have all been refining in Singapore for several
years. Shell now has its largest refinery world-wide on the island.
While the upgrading process has been heavily capital intensive, it has led
to cost efficiencies: Singapore is now regarded as among the world's most
efficient refining centres and is attracting business from producer
countries, most recently Kuwait and Bahrain.
A petrochemical industry has developed alongside Singapore's refining
sector. Du Pont, Mobil, GE plastics and others are investing more than
SDollars 2bn in a variety of projects. A landfill project is planned which
will unite five islands off the main island of Singapore into a SDollars 4bn
petrochemical complex.
Singapore interests have teamed up with Indonesian concerns to build what
will be one of the world's biggest oil storage depots on the Indonesian
island of Karimum, nearby to Singapore.
In time both Japan and China could become refining competitors of Singapore.
But Japan's refining costs are still more than 10 per cent above those of
Singapore, while China's domestic demand for refined products is likely to
blunt any growth in exports. Thailand, which has embarked on a large
refinery building programme, could provide some additional competition. But
for now Singapore is sitting pretty.

THE OPENING of the beef market has put more meat on Japanese tables, but an
estimated 57 per cent of consumers are concerned about the safety standards
of foreign producers, according to a study by the Economic Planning Agency.
When a strict quota system was relaxed in April 1991, after several years of
difficult negotiations between Washington and Tokyo, there was a presumption
in both countries that the lower prices of the imported product would
encourage Japanese to eat more beef.
But the EPA's survey found that only 23 per cent of Japanese reckon that
they consume more imported beef than before liberalisation and 12 per cent
now eat less imported beef, even though it is 20 to 30 per cent cheaper than
comparable domestic cuts.
The reason for the reluctance to buy more imported beef, most of which comes
from Australia and the US, appears to be the success of campaigns run by
Japanese farmers' groups to discredit the safety of imported meat.
From a video showing a family becoming ill after consuming imported meat to
a flood of leaflets on food safety, the farmers' groups and affiliated
consumer groups have created significant public concern about the use of
growth hormones and additives.
Only 6 per cent of those surveyed considered that imported beef is tastier
than the home grown version, while 48 per cent concluded politely that the
foreign meat 'does not compare unfavourably.'
However, 15.4 per cent said 'it looks bad' and a mere 1.7 per cent suggested
that it is very tasty.
There was a striking difference in the place of purchase, which reflects the
difficulty foreign products have in penetrating the country's small,
specialist stores.
About 21 per cent of consumers said they bought their Japanese beef at
specialist stores, while only 5.6 per cent used the same stores for imported
beef.
However, 42 per cent bought the imported meat at large supermarkets, which
tend to carry a broader range of products and are less bound by traditional
distribution relationships. About 27 per cent of consumers bought their
Japanese beef at large supermarkets.
The findings also highlight the success of Japanese producers in cornering
the top end of the beef market, leaving the US and Australian suppliers to
fight it out for market share in hamburger beef and cheaper cuts.
About 59 per cent of respondents said Japanese beef costs too much, while
only 4 per cent thought foreign beef was overly expensive.

<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S president-elect, Mr Kim Young-sam, yesterday appointed a group
of reformists as his senior advisers in the Blue House, the executive
mansion.
The appointments indicate that Mr Kim will pursue economic and political
changes promised in last year's presidential election.
There has been considerable speculation in Seoul about whether Mr Kim would
pursue reforms since his power base in the ruling Democratic Liberal Party
is weak.
Mr Kim did not join the DLP until 1990, when he merged his opposition party
with the government of President Roh Tae-woo.
The new presidential aides, some of whom have criticised Mr Roh's policies,
will play a key role, since Mr Kim appears determined to re-assert the power
of the Blue House over the bureaucracy.
The Blue House, which strictly ruled the country under the former military
dictatorship, has seen its power diluted under Mr Roh, who promoted
bureaucratic decentralisation as part of his democratisation programme.
Mr Kim, however, believes that the bureaucracy is hindering political and
economic reforms.
Mr Park Kwan-yong was appointed as chief presidential secretary, the most
influential post in the Blue House.
Mr Park is a close confidant of Mr Kim and holds a parliamentary seat in
Pusan, the new president's home town.
He joined the DLP in 1990 after being an opposition MP and began his
political career by serving as an aide to Mr Li Ki-taek, who now heads the
main opposition Democratic Party. He has criticised the National Security
Law, which has been used to punish domestic dissidents, and has promoted
inter-Korean relations.
Mr Park Jae-yoon was appointed as the president's economic adviser. A former
director of the Korea Institute of Finance and professor at Seoul National
University, he has advocated financial deregulation to improve the country's
economic performance.
Mr Choo Don-shik, who has argued for political reform as an editorial writer
for Chosun Ilbo, the country's largest newspaper, will the adviser for
political affairs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIME MINISTER Paul Keating of Australia yesterday stepped up efforts to win
the support of voters in marginal seats by offering ADollars 600m (Pounds
285.7m) in federal funds to assist a financially embarrassed state Labor
government.
Mr Keating said federal financial support was essential to help the state of
South Australia recover from a ADollars 3bn loss incurred by the
government-owned state bank.
The offer was widely seen as an attempt to shore up Labor support in South
Australia, where the government is defending four marginal seats in the
federal election, due on March 13.
Labor trails the conservative Liberal/National Party coalition by up to 12
points in the opinion polls. The coalition needs a swing of 0.9 per cent to
take power. Mr Keating's offer was accepted by Mr Lynn Arnold, leader of
South Australia's minority Labor government. He said the bank would be
privatised to reduce the state's ADollars 7bn debt burden.
The privatisation, which was expected, is likely to take place next year.
Analysts said the sale would probably return about ADollars 1bn to the state
government. Mr Keating's offer follows claims by the South Australian
conservative opposition that the federal coalition would provide ADollars
400m to the state over 10 years if it wins the election.
Mr Keating said he was not worried the offer would be regarded as an
electoral bribe.
The government and opposition are also locked in a bidding war for the
support of voters in seven marginal seats in the Queensland and northern New
South Wales sugar belt.

CHINA yesterday released the last two student activist leaders rounded up
after the 1989 pro-democracy protests that led to hundreds of deaths in
Beijing's central Tiananmen square after the army fired on protesters.
The early release of Wang Dan, who topped the most-wanted list, and
fellow-student Guo Haifeng is a further indication that China is anxious to
cool criticism of its human rights record. Several other dissidents have
been released recently.
The New China News Agency said the freeing of Wang and Guo meant that 'all
the students who violated the criminal law during the anti-government
disturbances in 1989. . . have been released'.
The freeing of the students, several months before their terms expired,
comes on the eve of delicate trade talks with visiting US officials, the
first high-level team from the Clinton administration to visit Beijing.
At the talks, China's huge trade surplus with the US will be discussed.
The dissidents' release also coincides with the presentation this week to
International Oympic Committee members of documents supporting Beijing's bid
to stage the Olympic Games in the year 2000.
Human rights groups have been opposing Beijing's candidacy in protest at
China's continued imprisonment of political activists.
The release of the two students by no means closes the chapter on the
Tiananmen square episode, however.
A number of 'non-student' dissidents rounded up after the incident remain in
prison.
In another gesture yesterday, China also freed a 76-year-old Roman Catholic
bishop, who had been sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment.
Bishop Zhu Hongsheng's continued detention had prompted protests
internationally.

FT  18 FEB 93 / ANC fails to ratify power sharing plan

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE African National Congress yesterday failed to ratify a power-sharing
plan agreed in principle last week with the government, damping hopes of
rapid progress toward a constitutional settlement in South Africa.
ANC officials said the organisation's policy-making national executive
committee had decided to defer ratification until its members had been
consulted. This could take weeks or months, and delay the planned timetable
for transition to democracy, which calls for the first multi-racial
elections early next year.
Multi-party constitutional talks, due to begin later this month, could open
on schedule, but progress will be frustrated unless the ANC gains rapid
endorsement of the power-sharing plan from its members at regional level,
who tend to be far more radical than the national leadership.
If regional leaders reject the the plan, which calls for multi-racial
power-sharing until the end of the century, the government had made clear it
would consider putting the deal to a national multi-racial referendum, over
the heads of the ANC, to try to break the logjam, the officials said.
ANC negotiators, who agreed the principles of power-sharing with the
government last week, remain confident they will be able to persuade the
wider membership to endorse the deal, though yesterday's decision represents
an embarrassment for them, and possibly a serious defeat.
Hard-line national executive members are understood to have criticised the
deal in Tuesday's meeting, even booing members of the organisation's
negotiating team. The radicals believe power should be shared with the
ruling National Party only during a nine-month period, while a
post-apartheid constitution is written, and not for the five-year period
agreed in negotiations with the government.
The ANC faction which supports the deal hopes endorsement from the regions
can be gained within a fortnight, posing no serious obstacle to progress in
negotiations. Much will depend on whether the ANC decides to canvass
membership opinion exhaustively, or through regional executive structures
which can be rapidly sounded out.
The executive's failure to ratify the deal shows the ANC's constant dilemma
in negotiations: whether to conclude deals secretly and present members with
a fait accompli, or try to gain support from the organisation's diverse and
fractious membership at every stage. The role of ANC leader Nelson Mandela
will be crucial. If he backs a power-sharing deal, it seems unlikely the
executive would oppose him.

A CAMPAIGN launched yesterday for the release of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the
detained Burmese opposition leader, has rekindled a fierce debate in Asia
about human rights and the merits of Asian countries intervening in their
neighbours' affairs.
Eight Nobel Peace Prize winners, after being refused entry to Burma, came to
neighbouring Thailand to start the campaign for their fellow laureate. Ms
Suu Kyi won the prize in 1991 and has been held under house arrest for over
three years by Rangoon's military junta.
The campaign has won support from the Clinton administration and
prizewinners unable to come to Thailand, such as Mother Teresa and Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev, former Soviet president. But China issued two warnings to
Thailand in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the Dalai Lama, the exiled
Tibetan spiritual leader, from taking part. China invaded Tibet in 1950.
The campaign to release Ms Suu Kyi marks a break from the traditional
South-East Asian policy of 'constructive engagement' with Burma. Thailand's
armed forces, enjoying lucrative logging concessions there, have criticised
the Thai government for hosting a visit they fear will damage Bangkok's
relations with both Beijing and Rangoon.
Gen Vimol Wongwanich, army commander, said such campaigns should be held in
the US, not Thailand. 'It's like inviting the battle into our house,' he
said. The Thai army banned the screening of an interview with the Dalai Lama
on one of the TV stations it controls.
Previous Thai governments have bowed to Chinese pressure over the Dalai
Lama, refusing him a visa in 1987 and 1990. But Mr Chuan Leekpai, the
civilian prime minister elected on a liberal ticket last year, has allowed
all the Nobel laureates into the country. Both he and King Bhumipol are
scheduled to meet them.
In Bangkok yesterday, the Dalai Lama avoided overt criticism of China or
Thailand, but implicitly chided them for supplying weapons and aid to the
Burmese junta and suggested an arms embargo would be a good idea.
'In Thailand and everywhere, the value of human rights and of democracy is
increasing,' he declared. 'In a new era, everyone is concerned about
democracy, human rights and freedom.'
The visiting laureates, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa,
northern Ireland peace campaigners Ms Betty Williams and Ms Mairead Maguire,
and an Amnesty International representative, are to meet Burmese refugees
today.
At the weekend some of them will go to Geneva to make a submission to the UN
Human Rights Commission.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian government has announced a partial deregulation of the domestic
fuels market as part of a pre-budget package which also includes a steep
increase in sugar and coal prices.
New Delhi is keen to show that its economic reforms package is regaining
momentum after last year's setback of the destruction by Hindu extremists of
the mosque at Ayodhya.
To this end, it has liberalised the import of kerosene and liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) and has also allowed the private sector, both domestic
and foreign, to enter the tightly controlled domestic fuels market.
A dual pricing system will make domestic fuels, at present in short supply,
more expensive, but freely available on the open market.
The government will continue to retail kerosene oil through its public
distribution system at subsidised rates, staining it blue to distinguish it
from the open market kerosene.
Users of LPG cylinders will not be entitled to subsidised kerosene on ration
cards as they are at present.
Opposition parties have criticised the government's 20 per cent increase in
the price of sugar and the dual pricing policy of domestic fuels, even
before the budget is presented on February 28.
The government yesterday announced an additional rise in the regulated price
of coal, amounting to an increase of 11.8-12.8 per cent for different
grades.
Soft coke, used for domestic purposes, has been spared.

LITTLE IS likely to induce a deeper sense of deja vu in the Middle East than
the arrival in the region of a new American secretary of state on yet

There is equally little to suggest that Mr Warren Christopher is going to
learn much during the next few days about the peace process that he has not
already gleaned from his experienced state department advisers and from his
conversations in the past two weeks with the leading players.
This may be the inevitable price to be paid for a change of US
administration.
But it could be a costly exercise at a moment when events and time are
pressing ever more heavily on those in the Middle East most committed to
negotiations.
Nearly 16 months and eight rounds of talks have passed since the opening
ceremony in Madrid.
But with each succeeding week the initial optimism of Madrid is being eroded
and the risk is increasing of events making it impossible for one or more of
the participants to continue negotiations.
US officials rightly point out that the fundamental reasons which brought
the representatives of Israel, the Palestinians, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon
to the talks are still valid.
To a greater or lesser extent all of them accept the need for a negotiated
settlement to the conflict that has blighted the world for more than four
decades.
However, since the autumn of 1991 nothing has been done to build popular
support for that stance. No delegation wishes to abort the process but the
Palestinians in particular are finding it ever more difficult to continue.
The immediate crisis stems from Israel's decision on December 17 to expel
415 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza solely on suspicion of being
active in Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two radical organisations opposed to the
peace process.
Under intense US pressure and under the unprecedented threat of United
Nations sanctions, Israel last week agreed to re-admit 100 and halve by one
year the expulsion period for the remainder.
Mr Christopher and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, hoped that
last Friday's UN statement welcoming the concession as a step in the right
direction would allow peace talks to resume. Their hopes were premature.
Mr Rabin's extreme reaction to the worsening violence in the occupied
territories was designed in large part to placate Israeli public opinion.
The response by the Palestine Liberation Organisation and its negotiators is
no less dependent on the mood in the West Bank and Gaza.
There, the harshness of the deportations, the increase in the killing of
young people by Israeli troops and the arbitrary destruction of homes is
working to increase the support for Hamas.
And it is cutting the ground from under the feet of the Palestinian
negotiators who live in the occupied territories.
These events have to be seen against the hopes raised by Labour's victory in
the Israeli elections last summer, won on a platform of reaching a swift
agreement with the Palestinians, and on an American policy which, under the
guidance of Mr James Baker, then secretary of state, had appeared to Arabs
more even-handed than for many years.
The haste with which Mr Christopher welcomed Mr Rabin's offer to take back
100 of the deportees as a virtual end to the issue suggested to some that
the US was tilting back more emphatically in Israel's favour.
If Mr Christopher wishes to reverse this impression, persuade the
Palestinians to resume negotiations and bring the parties back to the
substance of the peace process, he will, like so many of his predecessors,
eventually come to the core of the issue which is the US-Israeli
relationship.
Although Russia is the co-sponsor of the peace process, responsibility for
it is essentially American.
The US continues to give more than Dollars 3bn annually in military and
civil aid to Israel and is additionally providing loan guarantees for a
further Dollars 2bn a year.
Both governments officially refuse to acknowledge that these huge sums offer
scope for diplomatic leverage.
But a middle-class America which is being asked to pay higher taxes could
well come to a different conclusion if Israel is deemed to be unhelpful in
building on what President Clinton described on Tuesday as an 'historic
moment' in the Middle East.
Mr Christopher says he wants to listen rather than to talk during his week
in the region.
If he then concludes that what is most required is a clear and emphatic
American response, his trip will not have been wasted.
The lesson learned by President Jimmy Carter, the last Democrat to inhabit
the White House, remains valid. Israelis and Arabs cannot make peace on
their own.

FT  18 FEB 93 / How Mr Pung makes gold pay 8%: Its high status in Cambodia
is the result of two decades of war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE much conventional wisdom, the belief that gold never earns interest is
wrong. You can earn as much as 8 per cent annually and add 80 grammes to
each 1kg bar every year; but to achieve this, you have to take the gold to
Phnom Penh and deposit it in a small Cambodian bank called Canadia Gold and
Trust Corporation.
Asked how he can pay 8 per cent interest on gold deposits, Mr Pung Kheav Se,
the general manager, gives a banker's answer: he lends out the gold at 18
per cent. 'Gold,' he says, 'is accepted by everybody.'
The unusually high status of gold as a medium of exchange in Cambodia is the
result of more than two decades of war and financial chaos. Cambodians know
that the riel, the local currency, has a tendency to plummet in value, and
they remember that the guerrillas of the Khmer Rouge, who seized power in
1975, abolished money during their reign of terror.
Mr Pung, a Cambodian of Chinese ethnic origin, was a businessman in Phnom
Penh when the Khmer Rouge took over and force-marched the inhabitants of the
capital into the countryside. After three years of working in the rice
paddies and hiding his bourgeois origins, he took refuge in Thailand,
eventually emigrating to Canada (hence the bank's name).
Canadia Gold and Trust, a joint venture in which Mr Pung's family holds a 70
per cent stake and the central bank the remaining 30 per cent, was
established in 1991.
Mr Pung imports 25kg boxes of gold from Swiss Bank Corporation in Hong Kong,
puts it through a mill and, with the authority of the central bank, issues
gold bars in the traditional Cambodian weights.
Jewellers in Phnom Penh's busy central market display the bars alongside the
watches and gold necklaces worn as a form of security by a people unable to
shake off the fear they may one day have to flee at a moment's notice.
Gold, its price in dollars and in fast-devaluing riels set daily by a group
of ethnic Chinese traders, is routinely used for the purchase of property in
Cambodia and for transactions involving local products such as tobacco or
beans, although it has lost out to the US dollar as a means of paying for
imports.
'Cambodian property-owners don't worry about the US dollar,' says Mr Pung.
'They compare gold and riels. . . so they always think they are making
money.'
Mr Pung says Canadia has issued Dollars 80m (Pounds 56m) worth of gold since
December 1991 (there was a surge in demand at the peak of the property boom
last year), but the actual amount that has come into Cambodia is much
greater. Hundreds of kilogrammes are flown in tax-free every month and
smuggled into neighbouring Thailand and Vietnam to avoid import duties in
those countries.
Inside Cambodia, soldiers serving with the United Nations peacekeeping
forces, particularly from the Indian sub-continent where there are curbs on
gold imports, are as eager as the Cambodians to buy gold. Some of them have
it made up into chunky bracelets so they can take it home unhindered.
The overall effect of the UN presence, however, has been to undermine the
gold market by flooding Phnom Penh with cash dollars; dollars are more
liquid and more convenient to carry than gold, even if they are easier to
counterfeit.
When Mr Pung opened Canadia in 1991, half his business was in gold and half
in dollars. Now dollars account for about 75 per cent of turnover, gold for
22 per cent and riels for 3 per cent. (Canadia pays a remarkably high 8.5
per cent interest on dollar deposits, lending dollars at a much higher rate
to local property developers).
But Cambodia's chronic instability, and the departure of most of the 22,000
UN soldiers and civilians after elections in May, may secure a place for
gold in the country's domestic business dealings.
'The gold market will continue in the future unless the government issues a
law not to allow the circulation of gold,' says Mr Pung. 'I don't think they
will do that.'

FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Kantor warns of trade review by Washington
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is reviewing a number of US trade positions,
including the Airbus agreement reached with the EC last summer to limit
government support, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said
yesterday.
'It is a new day and a new administration,' he said. The administration
would be assessing whether or not to proceed on the path set by its
predecessors or to 'change course'. On many issues it is likely to change.
Last week President Bill Clinton raised the issue of Airbus when answering a
question in a televised 'town hall meeting' in Seattle. 'The Europeans are
going to have to quit subsidising Airbus,' he said. 'I'm not going to roll
over and play dead.'
Mr Kantor said both sides had the option to withdraw from the Airbus
agreement. It was supposed to have been 'multilateralised' by summer.
On other issues, Mr Kantor said the US and EC might hold meetings with Japan
as a way to get the Uruguay Round international trade talks moving and that
US, Mexican and Canadian trade officials would meet during the week of March
15 to discuss side agreements to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
This was agreed in talks yesterday between Mr Kantor and Mr Jaime Serra
Puche, his Mexican counterpart. During the meeting Mr Kantor put intense
pressure on the Mexican government to withdraw from a fund which was
advertising its intent to attract US businesses to Mexico.
National Financiers (Nafinsa), a Mexican development bank, was one of the
limited partners in the AmeriMex Fund, which has issued a brochure
advertising its intention to buy US companies and then move 'a portion or
all of the manufacturing operations . . . to Mexico to take advantage of
savings in the cost of labour'.
Mr Serra told Mr Kantor he knew nothing about the brochure. Shortly after
they met he called the trade representative to say Nafinsa would withdraw
its investment from the fund.
The fund had drawn fire from Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader,
who wrote to Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari saying such funds
should not be allowed to operate.
Mr Kantor praised the swift Mexican action, saying he was 'impressed by it
and pleased'.
The side agreements are to deal with labour, the environment and import
surges. Mr Kantor said the development of enforcement mechanisms was vital,
as was finding a way to address labour standards so that businesses did not
flee south of the border to evade US rules.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL Aircraft Industries, flagship of Israel's troubled state-owned
defence sector, has received a welcome shot in the arm by winning a Dollars
240m contract from the US Defence Department for 56 unmanned aircraft in
partnership with San Diego-based TRW.
IAI will make the so-called drones - increasingly used by armed forces to
probe behind enemy lines without exposing the lives of pilots - their
payloads and ground stations in Israel. TRW will manage the project and
carry out testing and training.
Earlier this month, the government agreed to provide a Dollars 280m
restructuring package for IAI, the country's biggest company, to help it
overcome a slump in sales which will result in a Dollars 50m-Dollars 60m
loss when its 1992 results are reported. Now set to lay off 1,500 of its
17,400 workforce, IAI is struggling to stay competitive with its
international rivals and increase its sales of civilian products.
Ironically, last year it was the cancellation or postponement of several
civilian aircraft contracts which knocked its annual overseas sales of
Dollars 1.25bn back by Dollars 100m. IAI accounts for some 17 per cent of
all Israel's industrial exports.
One of its successes has been its leading world role in producing unmanned
aircraft, used chiefly in military reconnaissance work. IAI drones were used
by the US armed forces during the Gulf war to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait.

FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Clinton gets tips on fine-tuning Nafta -
An influential report offers policy signposts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGGRESSIVE enforcement of national labour laws in Mexico and a Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 2.1bn) environmental clean-up fund are called for in an assessment
of the North American Free Trade Agreement released yesterday by the
influential Washington-based Institute for International Economics.
The recommendations address fierce criticism of Nafta, particularly from US
labour and environmental interests which have been lobbying the Clinton
administration for amendments to the regional trade agreement.
Nafta was signed late last year by President George Bush, Mexico's President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, and Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister.
It is to be put to Congress for ratification later this year.
President Bill Clinton has committed the new administration to amendments to
the text, taking account of these pressures.
The IIE assessment - giving an overall B+ grade to the 2,000-page agreement
 -is intended to provide signposts to the policies he could adopt. It gives
clear support for the administration's call for supplementary agreements to
Nafta on labour and the environment, and recommends a Dollars 3bn 'Nafta
fund' in preference to a proposal from Democratic senator Max Baucus for a
special Nafta transaction tax.
The Nafta fund would finance the environmental clean-up on the US-Mexican
border and would help to underwrite work by the Environmental Protection
Commission, already suggested by Mr Clinton, in sponsoring broad assessments
of environmental conditions in each country. The IIE calls on the three
Nafta signatories to earmark for the fund Dollars 300m a year each for five
years, from 1994.
The Environmental Commission should also set up procedures to encourage
harmonisation of environmental standards, and set fines, or 'green fees',
for countries distorting trade inside the region because of poor
environmental standards.
The study predicts that Nafta would create a net 171,000 new jobs in the US,
with US surpluses in its trade with Mexico varying between Dollars 7bn and
Dollars 9bn a year up to 1995.
'Ross Perot got it wrong,' said Mr Fred Bergsten, director of the IIE.
'There has been a huge sucking sound, as Perot described, but it has been
due to US exports and the creation of American jobs.' Mr Perot last year
predicted Nafta would create the 'sucking sound' of US jobs lost to Mexico.
Mr Bergsten noted a Dollars 13bn swing in favour of the US in trade with
Mexico since 1989, a shift which he estimates has already created
200,000-300,000 jobs in the US.
While 316,000 jobs would be created by Nafta, the IIE report forecasts that
145,000 jobs would be 'dislocated' - a bare 2 per cent of the 8.9m jobs lost
in the US in the five years to 1990 because of plant closures, bankruptcies
and lay-offs. It calls for Dollars 335m a year to be spent from existing
tariff revenues for adjustment programmes linked with Nafta job losses, but
calls for this to be part of a wider national worker training programme.
Mr Gary Hufbauer and Mr Jeffrey Schott, the authors of the report, recommend
new negotiations to establish Mexican commitment to 'aggressive enforcement
of national labour laws and regulations'. They call for a trinational
commission to enforce labour standards, and authorise sanctions if
governments fail to halt abuses.
However, they insist the ultimate value of Nafta is in its boost to the
competitiveness of regional industries, rather than in job creation.
'Efficiency benefits and growth stimulus could exceed Dollars 15bn annually.
This figure, rather than jobs gained or lost, is the true measure of the
economic gain from the Nafta agreement,' which they see as one aspect of a
wider US strategy aimed at improving competitiveness and productivity.
The assessment confirms, but is more optimistic than, the findings of a
study just released by the US International Trade Commission on the
potential impact of Nafta.
This predicts the trade pact would provide a lift of up to 0.5 per cent of
real GNP in Canada and the US, with a potential increase of 11.4 per cent in
Mexico.
The ITC says US exports to Mexico could be boosted from 5.2 per cent to 27
per cent by the agreement, with Mexico's exports to the US jumping by
between 3.4 per cent and 15 per cent. It predicts aggregate employment gains
in the US of 'less than 1 per cent' of a workforce that currently totals
117m.
The commission says industries which will see greatest benefit will be
machine tools, bearings, industrial machinery, steel mill products,
pharmaceuticals, textiles, grains and oilseeds, cotton, wood products and
motor parts. Industries likely to suffer will be the motor industry,
garments, flat glass, glassware, household appliances, shrimps, peanuts, and
vegetables.
It points to 'an almost discernible effect on US wage rates for both
low-skilled and high-skilled workers' - a conclusion shared by the IIE
study.
The studies coincide with signals from labour groups that they may be poised
to moderate claims that Nafta will be a catastrophe for workers and
consumers.
As leaders of the influential AFL-CIO trade union grouping held their first
executive council meeting since the presidential election, they hinted that
US workers must come to terms with closer integration in Mexico, pressing
for higher minimum wages in Mexico instead of opposing Nafta itself.

FT  18 FEB 93 / World Trade News: European business in plea to Japan - Tokyo
urged to open door for imports

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN business leaders yesterday added their voice to a growing chorus of
discontent with Japan's burgeoning trade surplus and called on the Japanese
government to take a more affirmative and managed approach to the problem.
The Council of the European Business Community said cultural factors were in
part to blame for Japan's growing trade surplus and suggested a more managed
approach would go further in dealing with a problem that natural market
forces had failed to solve.
The views expressed by the council, which represented European interests at
the Fourth Import Board - an international forum of foreign businessmen and
Japanese government officials held in Tokyo yesterday - are similar to those
of an increasingly popular school of thought in the US. This says that,
because of unique cultural factors, trade with Japan cannot be left to
ordinary free market forces.
'The natural market forces are not sufficient to bring, in the short term, a
new situation in which imports have a share commensurate with their relative
price and quality,' the council said. Since normal market forces have not
been effective in changing the situation, 'we are deeply convinced that the
sectoral approach would be the most efficient means to reach improvements'.
European representatives at the forum also called on the Japanese government
to introduce succeeding supplementary budgets with firm funds directly
allocated to government purchases of imported products. 'What we are asking
for is a special programme of imports for use by government agencies,' Mr
Henri Martre, honorary president of Aerospatiale, said.
Japan also needed to make bidding procedures for government procurement more
open and fair and to ensure purchase decisions are not politically motivated
but based on commercial considerations.
It was difficult to understand why Airbus, which has 30 per cent of the
world market, had just 10 per cent of Japan's market, he said.
The council recommended that the Japanese government try to quantify the
benefits of any programmes to boost imports and that it seek to match the
best practice of the most liberalised countries in the EC rather than align
itself with the minimum level of liberalisation.
In spite of the Japanese government's efforts, Japan had a trade surplus
with the EC last year amounting to Dollars 32bn (Pounds 22bn). Imports into
Japan from the EC fell 1.6 per cent while exports to the EC increased 14 per
cent.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Lira at record low amid political fears
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that talks between Italian political parties on broadening the ruling
coalition could undermine Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's eight-month-old
government yesterday pushed the lira to a record low of L950 to the D-Mark.
The parties are discussing a broader coalition to provide greater authority
for reform of Italy's unmanageable system of proportional representation.
A parliamentary commission has proposed a new first-past-the-post system for
electing the majority of the two houses. But big differences remain on the
details and a strong government is needed to cope with the question of
whether to go along with calls for a referendum on the reform.
The coalition, of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and
Liberals, has only a narrow parliamentary majority, and increasingly lacks
legitimacy as Italy's political class falls foul of the ever-widening
corruption scandals.
The proposals for widening the coalition centre on bringing in the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the small Republican Party and
the populist Lombard League.
The PDS is making tough demands, urging a softening of the austerity budget
to halt rising unemployment, while Mr Umberto Bossi's the Lombard League
wants a commitment to early elections.
Both parties, and the Republicans, would also prefer to join a government
with a new prime minister.
Magistrates yesterday told Mr Gianni De Michelis, former foreign minister
and currently deputy head of the Socialist party, that he was under
investigation over two incidents on top of the allegations of kickbacks in
the Veneto region for which he is being investigated, writes Haig Simonian
in Milan.
The new allegations concern Italy's aid programme to developing countries
and the investigation into alleged political corruption in Milan.

FRANCE'S centre-right coalition is on course for a crushing victory against
the ruling Socialists in next month's parliamentary elections, according to
the latest opinion poll. This suggests the coalition could win four-fifths
of the National Assembly's 555 mainland seats,
The Sofres poll suggested that 40 per cent of French voters favour the
conservative RPR and UDF alliance, with 21 per cent backing the Socialists.
This would give the conservatives 453 seats and the Socialists 80, compared
with their present tally of 247.
Support for the ecologists, who pushed the Socialists into third place in
recent polls, has slipped to 15 per cent.
President Francois Mitterrand, who has hitherto stayed aloof from the fray,
will tonight stage the first of two live television programmes in which he
will answer questions from voters. The Socialists hope the programmes will
be as successful as his TV debate before September's Maastricht referendum.
Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy, however, is still hampered by the row over
the FFr1m (Pounds 120,000) interest-free loan he received from Mr
Roger-Patrice Pelat, a financier later charged with insider trading. The
justice ministry on Tuesday rejected a judge's request to investigate the
loan. But Liberation, the centre-left newspaper, yesterday published a
stinging editorial, criticising Mr Beregovoy for accepting it.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Bundesbank rejects further rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER cuts in short-term interest rates could lead to a 'stop-go' policy
for the German economy, risking higher long-term rates and endangering jobs,
the Bundesbank warns in its latest monthly report.
There was no sense in making counter-cyclical cuts in rates in an attempt to
revive the economy, the report adds.
The weakening of the western German economy became clearer towards the end
of last year. Gross domestic product in the final quarter fell by an
adjusted 1.5 per cent from the previous three months and by 0.5 per cent
against the last quarter of 1991.
In manufacturing the seasonally adjusted production figure for the fourth
quarter was 5.5 per cent down on the comparable period in 1991. Separately,
the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin said yesterday
that west German GDP was likely to fall by a real 1 per cent in the first
quarter this year against the last quarter of 1992.
But the Bundesbank said there was no cause for undue pessimism.
Manufacturing industries were not representative of the economy as a whole:
construction and services in general were doing better than those sectors
hard hit by falling exports.
It said that in contrast to many other countries Germany was not suffering
the delayed effects of overheating in the late 1980s.
Shares and property prices had not collapsed in Germany, nor were there
problems in the financial system.
Long-term interest rates were far more important for German industry than
the short-term rates set with reference to the Lombard and discount rate
which the Bundesbank cut two weeks ago today. The discount rate was cut by
25 basis points to 8 per cent and the Lombard rate by 50 basis points to 9
per cent.
Over 80 per cent of bank credits in Germany were provided on a long-term
basis, the Bundesbank pointed out. These rates had fallen 'extraordinarily
sharply,' dropping 1.5 per cent to under 7 per cent since September, the
Bundesbank said.
This fall reflected the markets' confidence that the German central bank
would ultimately be successful in its battle against inflation, which
reached an annual rate of 4.4 per cent in January.

FT  18 FEB 93 / 'We cannot keep asking for more': As east German
unemployment rises, Judy Dempsey witnesses fierce debate in a Berlin cafe
over whether workers are pricing themselves out of jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIGITTA Strater has seen better days. 'Before the Wall fell, I was selling
450 white loaves and 600 mixed loaves a day. Now I am selling about 20
white, and 90 mixed loaves.
'People aren't buying that much any more. Its not because my prices are too
high. Its because of the unemployment.'
Her small, brightly lit bakery is in Kopenick, once the pulse of east
Berlin's industrial heartland. Before 1989, more than 25,000 men and women
worked in the region's six biggest factories. Today, fewer than 5,000 have
secure jobs.
The customers, who in the space of half an hour passed through her shop on a
bitterly cold and snowy morning, were all unemployed, except for Heinz.
'I have a job, over the road with BICC,' he said pointing across to the
large 19th century cable factory which the British-based BICC bought earlier
this year.
'I am lucky. The managers know what they are doing. They said they will make
the plant competitive with other big German firms. There's some hope for
me.'
Heinz, an electrical engineer, earns DM1,800 (Pounds 762) a month, low by
western German standards, but high by eastern ones.
He says he can get by. 'I know everyone is complaining about the price
rises, especially for housing. You know we are losing all our subsidies. I
now pay DM600 for my flat, a rise of DM350. And the flat hasn't even got hot
water. But I think I would settle for jobs rather than a higher income at
the moment.'
His remarks provoked a lively discussion in the bakery. 'Are you crazy?'
shouted Andreas. 'The unions said we could get the same wages as the Wessies
(the term used for west Germans).'
Andreas used to work in a small tool shop, close to the cable factory. 'The
shop closed down last year. No one would buy any of our stuff. The unions
said we would get 26 per cent more this year. We need the money.'
'And then what will happen?' said Heinz. 'There will be even more
unemployment. We have to make compromises, at least for a short time. We are
talking about getting our country off the ground.' Frau Strater, dressed in
her big, white baker's apron, said it was time for everyone to make
compromises. 'The old structures are dead. We have to start all over again.'
She added that I G Metall, Germany's giant engineering union which is
holding arbitration talks with the employers' federation in the five east
German states in order to secure a 26 per cent rise for its members, would
have to settle for less. 'The people want to work. Jobs will come here
eventually. But we can't keep asking for more and more.'
'I am not asking for more. I only want my job back,' said Irmgard, a
26-year-old with a three-year-old daughter. After maternity leave, which was
generous under the former communists in east Germany, Irmgard returned to
the Berlin Plastikwerke, her employers, last March.
'They said my place was no longer guaranteed. I now have DM600 a month to
live on. I am angry. I'm not looking for the higher wages. I am looking for
work.' Every day, Irmgard comes into the bakery and flicks through the
Berliner Zeitung. 'Something has to turn up,' she said.
In a nearby smoke-filled pub, young men were downing litres of beer by eight
o'clock in the morning.
Henry, 22, a truck driver, kept criticising the unions. 'They should get us
more money,' he said. His drinking colleagues said they didn't really care
about the unions. 'I'm telling you. We are finished if we lose our jobs,'
said Gerhard, 43, a driver for Coca-Cola.
Out in the streets, which three years ago were full of activity, Cornelia
was hurrying to work - across the River Spree to west Berlin. Until last
year, Cornelia, 49, had worked as a nurse in an old people's home in east
Berlin.
'I could have stayed there. But the money is better in the west. I now earn
DM3,000 a month. I consider myself lucky on one level. But also I got up and
did something about my situation. We can't keep moaning. We can't keep
demanding higher wages if we are not producing anything.
'Eventually, things will get better here, and in the rest of Germany. We
have to make it work,' she said.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Brussels clears BA takeover of Dan-Air
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has approved the merger between British Airways and
Dan-Air, arguing that it does not significantly affect services between
Belgium and Britain.
The presence of BA, Sabena, the Belgian flag carrier, and British Midland
meant there were three large competitors on the rapidly growing
Brussels-London route.
The three airlines between them fly 23 times a day from Heathrow to
Brussels: BA has seven, Sabena eight and British Midland eight. BA gained
four flights as a result of acquiring Dan-Air's low-cost operations at
Gatwick last year. But Sabena acquired two extra slots at Heathrow last
month.
The Belgian government complained in November about the possible
anti-competitive impact of the deal. This followed calls from the heads of
Air France, the French flag carrier, and Sabena for the Commission to take a
more critical view of BA's expansion plans in Europe.
Air France, which has a stake in Sabena, also complained about the original
Commission decision not to launch a full-scale anti-trust inquiry into BA's
acquisition of Dan-Air for a nominal Pounds 1, plus assumption of the ailing
airline's liabilities.
Belgium resorted to a previously unused clause in the EC's merger rules
which allows the Commission's anti-trust authorities to investigate the
impact on competition on their national territory.
But the Commission said the effects of the BA/Dan-Air merger applied only to
the Gatwick-Brussels route. BA's acquisition 'neither creates nor reinforces
a dominant position' in Belgium.

FT  18 FEB 93 / EC hints at shift in stance over Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday dropped hints that the
deeper-than-expected recession in Europe may require a retreat from the
strict economic performance targets required for European monetary union.
Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, said cyclical economic
factors and their impact on budget deficits may have to be considered in
1996 - the earliest date when a majority of EC states could vote to join
Emu.
He stressed the performance targets themselves could not be changed because
they were in the Maastricht treaty. But he cited the example of a member
state with a budget deficit of 3.5 per cent of national output, just above
the 3 per cent target set down in the Maastricht treaty. If it could show
its deficit was heading clearly downward to, say, 2.5 per cent of GDP, it
would be well placed to qualify for Emu.
Mr Christophersen's comments reflect a widely held view in Brussels that the
poor prospects for growth make more likely a generous interpretation of the
Emu 'convergence' criteria on inflation, budget deficits, and government
debt.
'There is room for judgment,' he said, stressing that EC states at
Maastricht rejected 'purely mechanistic' criteria for Emu. But in the same
breath he said all countries that fulfilled the criteria in 1996 had not
just 'a duty but an obligation' to apply for Emu.
Under Maastricht, the Commission will present a report in 1996 on member
states' economic performance in the run-up to Emu. But the final arbiters of
who qualifies for the Emu club will be the member states themselves in the
Council of Ministers.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THYSSEN and Krupp, Germany's two largest steel producers, and Saarstahl, the
sixth largest, are holding talks on future co-operation in their output of
certain products.
The aim of the talks, precipitated by the crisis in the steel industry, is
to decide whether significant cost reductions can be made by greater
specialisation between the three companies.
The first details emerged as 10,000 steel workers demonstrated on the
streets of Dortmund against the threat of mass job losses, and the closure
of an entire steel plant belong to Hoesch Stahl, in the process of merging
with Krupp Stahl.
At the same time Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German Steel
Federation, warned that the industry in west Germany alone might have to
shed 25,000 to 30,000 jobs, under the latest capacity cuts proposed at the
European Commission in Brussels. East Germany would lose 10,000 jobs.
The negotiations between Thyssen, Krupp and Saarstahl follow two abortive
efforts at co-operation agreements between German steel producers in the
past 18 months.
This time they have been personally agreed by Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief
executive of Krupp holding company, and Mr Heinz Kriwet, head of Thyssen
group.
Thyssen Stahl said the talks would focus on 'whether cost improvements could
be achieved in the long products sector (girders, rods and the like) through
a division of labour in the process of an exchange of programmes.
Thyssen and Krupp were involved in a previous round of talks on possible
co-operation in special steels production - virtually all Krupp's long
products output consists of special steels. These talks ended abruptly last
year when Thyssen decided instead to amalgamate its two producing companies,
Thyssen Stahl and Thyssen Edelstahl.
A further round of talks was initiated by Krupp last year with
Klockner-Werke and Saarstahl, which also foundered. However the recent slump
in the European steel market has forced the big producers to reopen their
talks.
Klockner-Werke, currently in negotiations on debt relief with its major
creditors, has been excluded from the latest talks.
The threat of thousands of job losses throughout the German industry has
caused a surge of labour militancy, barely restrained by IG Metall, the
giant engineering and steel workers' union.
The union has called for a mass national demonstration on March 26, but
workers fear that will come too late to prevent agreement on further plant
closures.

FT  18 FEB 93 / IMF loan facility likely for Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLISH parliament's approval last week of a tight 1993 budget has paved
the way for agreement on a new Dollars 660m (Pounds 456m) IMF standby loan
at the next executive board meeting of the International Monetary Fund in
early March, a senior IMF official said yesterday.
Mr Daniel Kaeser, the executive director for Poland, said the vote
restraining the budget deficit to around 81,000bn zlotys(Pounds 3.4bn), or 5
per cent of GDP, opened the way to board approval. It also underlined the
Fund's assessment that 'the reform process in Poland is becoming a success
story with economic growth picking up,' he added.
Approval of a new loan to replace an earlier Dollars 1.7bn facility aborted
by earlier government instability and above-budget spending, is expected to
unlock a series of significant financial agreements and encourage private
investment.
IMF approval for the Polish government's letter of intent will lead to a 20
per cent reduction in Poland's Dollars 32bn official government debt. This
is the second and final stage of the 50 per cent total official debt
reduction agreed by the Paris club of official creditors in March 1991.
An IMF agreement is also required for completion of Poland's negotiations
with the London Club for a similar reduction in Warsaw's Dollars 12.1bn debt
to commercial banks. The first round of commercial debt negotiations took
place in Vienna last week following the recent appointment of Mr Krzysztof
Krowacki as Poland's chief debt negotiator.
A green light from the IMF is also expected to be followed by World bank
board approval of more than Dollars 1bn of new loans for the energy sector,
industrial restructuring and farm modernisation. Loans in the pipeline
include a Dollars 450m facility to help finance bank debt restructuring
prior to privatisation.
Several government credit agencies, including the UK government's ECGD, are
also expected to resume export credit cover for Polish business once the
above official debt agreements are in place.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPORTERS of President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday proposed a
constitutional 'compromise' which would effectively neutralise the Russian
parliament led by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, his arch-rival.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a deputy prime minister, said last night that parliament
should refrain from exercising its rights to 'interfere' with the
government's economic programme until a constitution was adopted. He said
they should also not have a say in adopting a new constitution spelling out
the division of power between the executive, parliament and the government.
He said that for the Congress of Peoples' deputies - the full parliament -
to adopt a constitution is 'like the situation when a man is the judge of
his own case.'
Mr Shakhrai said the constitution, drafts of which are now being prepared
and exchanged by teams representing the president and parliament, should be
agreed by a constituent assembly or alternatively by a referendum. Mr
Shakhrai is a member of the president's team in the talks.
Mr Yeltsin, he said, should also refrain from interference with the
government. The government, however, is mainly at odds with parliament.
It was clear in Mr Shakhrai's account of the president's strategy that Mr
Yeltsin is prepared to confront Mr Khasbulatov on the economy. The main
issue is the lack of agreement between the government and the central bank
on the issuing of credits. Mr Shakhrai said the government should end the
'abnormal situation' in which it has no power over the bank's credit policy.
Over the next few days, the joint presidential-parliamentary commission is
due to thrash out a constitutional agreement which must then be ratified by
a one-day extraordinary Congress of Peoples' Deputies in early March.
Mr Shakhrai stressed that if agreement could not be reached, a referendum
set for April 11 on the constitution would proceed.
He warned of chaos and dictatorship if agreement could not be found, saying
that in that case a constitution would be beside the point because 'there
would be no elections for 30 or 40 years.'
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister for foreign economic
relations, warned last night that if foreign creditors forced Russia to pay
more than Dollars 2.5bn this year towards the interest due on the Dollars
80bn debt it inherited from the Soviet Union it would do so, but the result
would be 'catastrophe,' particularly for the other former Soviet republics
which would be deprived of cheap oil because Russia would sell more oil for
hard currency.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Bonn gives the signal for railways reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday approved a reform plan for the country's
entire loss-making railway system, designed to relieve a DM70bn (Pounds
30bn) debt burden and pave the way for its privatisation.
The west German Bundesbahn and east German Reichsbahn will be turned into a
joint stock company from January 1 next year, but with its shares remaining
in government ownership for the next 10 years.
The entire plan requires the support of the opposition Social Democrats in
order to gain the two-thirds majority needed in the federal parliament to
change the constitution.
Mr Klaus Daubertshauser, SPD parliamentary leader in charge of transport,
said parliament would have to make sure the reforms did not jeopardise
loss-making rail routes.
The creation of a joint-stock company, called Deutsche Bahn AG, aims to free
the railways' management from red tape and the vested interests of
politicians.
At the moment, any investment above DM5m requires the approval of the
finance ministry.
The reform will also remove the special status of many employees who, as
public servants, have jobs for life and enjoy special benefits.
The German Industry Federation, in a statement in support of the reform
plans, said yesterday the railways could not operate if it remained subject
to state-owned companies' regulations.
But the change in employees' status might bring the government into deeper
conflict with the Social Democrats and the unions, who want to protect the
jobs and benefits of the railways' employees.
The means of financing the rail reform is likely to create further political
conflict.
Last week, the government's three coalition parties agreed to levy a yearly
fee on users of motorways and to transfer the revenues to the railways.
But the proposal was denounced by Greens and politicians from all sides.
Equally controversial is the possibility of raising a petrol tax to finance
the railway reforms.
A government working group is due to come up with a report on both issues on
March 10.
The loss-making railways will have debts of DM70bn by the end of this year
and interest payments of DM12bn.
Mr Gunther Krause, the transport minister, said that without reform the
railways' debt would climb to DM569bn by 2003.
The reform package should reduce this to DM139bn, he said.

FT  18 FEB 93 / EC steelmakers to face more closures, Brussels warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday warned EC steelmakers they would have to
close even more plants than originally envisaged if they wanted commercial
and financial support from the Community.
The call for more cuts came as the Commission unveiled a rescue package to
help protect the industry, which is suffering from overcapacity, competition
from cheap non-EC imports and the worsening recession. The EC would provide
Ecu900m (Pounds 740m) of financial support for closure costs, but only if
member states match funding promised by the Commission
The Commission refused to estimate how many jobs might be lost in the EC
industry as a result of capacity cuts, but an internal Brussels report has
suggested that the original, more modest closure programme could lead to at
least 50,000 redundancies. A German steel industry spokesman yesterday
warned that it alone might have to shed 35,000 to 40,000 jobs under the new
proposals.
In their original forecasts, steel producers suggested they could reduce
production of crude steel by up to 25.8m tonnes over the next three years,
and rolled products by 17.9m tonnes. Mr Bangemann said yesterday that this
was 'not sufficient', and steelmakers would have to cut a further 4m or 5m
tonnes of capacity. Altogether, the Commission is looking for cuts of up to
30m tonnes in crude steel, and about 19m tonnes in rolled steel.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert,
responsible for competition, said they hoped the plan would receive the
political backing of industry ministers at a special meeting next week.
However, they will not ask member states to take a formal decision on the
package before May.
Mr Fernand Braun, the EC's 'steel envoy', is to renew contacts with 70
steelmakers in the hope that they can offer more capacity cuts to satisfy
the Commission before the May meeting. The producers will be asked to commit
themselves to a binding closure programme by the end of September, and to
carry it out by the end of 1995.
The draft programme approved yesterday includes controversial plans to
reduce alleged unfair competition from cheap steel imports from eastern
Europe.

UP TO one-quarter of the workforce has experienced unemployment since it
started rising in early 1990 and almost exactly half the unemployed are now
homeowners, according to a Financial Times analysis of government data.
These, and other figures, illustrate why unemployment is taking a far
heavier toll of economic confidence than in previous recessions, and why the
government is urgently considering a package of measures aimed at the 'white
collar' jobless to accompany the March 16 Budget.
The government will today announce that the raw unemployment total, not
adjusted for seasonal variation, has breached the 3m barrier for the second
time in a decade.
The seasonally adjusted figure will remain just below the 3m mark but today
will still be marked by nationwide demonstrations and a lobby of Parliament
organised by the Trades Union Congress.
The FT analysis has found that 49 per cent of the unemployed own or are
still buying their homes compared with 50 per cent who live in rented
accommodation - the corresponding figures in 1984 were 42 per cent and 57
per cent.
The increase in unemployment among mortgage holders is also illustrated by
the government's figures for income support, the main benefit for the
unemployed, which covers mortgage interest payments. In 1990 income support
was paying out Pounds 544m for mortgage interest. This rose in 1991 to
Pounds 949m, almost 10 per cent of the Pounds 10bn which income support
spends on the unemployed.
Manufacturing continued to lose a far higher proportion of jobs than the
service sector between 1989 and 1992 - minus 14 per cent compared with minus
1.5 per cent. But in previous recessions the same 10 to 15 per cent of the
workforce moved in and out of employment, whereas unemployment has this time
extended much further occupationally and regionally.
About 11.3m have joined the unemployment count since April 1990, but up to
half of them will have been counted more than once. This still means that
around one-quarter of the workforce have been affected and polls show that
half of all households fear that a member could become unemployed.
The increase in unemployment in the south is also shown by the fact that 35
per cent of the long-term unemployed live there compared with 58 per cent in
the north. In 1984 the corresponding figures were 29 per cent and 67 per
cent. Nationwide, about 1.5m people have been unemployed for more than six
months but one quarter find a job within one month.
The white-collar and qualified component of the unemployed has increased
since 1984 when 50 per cent of the unemployed had no qualifications - that
figure was down to 35 per cent by 1992.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Clinton sets out Dollars 500bn package to cut deficit: State
of Union address outlines tax rises and spending curbs to save Dollars 140bn
by 1997
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night launched a four-year Dollars 500bn package
of tax increases and spending cuts designed to cut the annual US budget
deficit by Dollars 140bn to Dollars 206.5bn in 1997.
The programme combines long-term tax increases and spending cuts with a
short-term boost to the economy, involving expanded infrastructure spending
and a short-term investment tax credit.
'Unless we have the courage to start building our future and stop borrowing
from it, we are condemning ourselves to years of stagnation, interrupted
only by recession,' President Clinton said in his State of the Union address
to Congress in which he outlined his programme.
But Mr Robert Michel, the Republican leader in the House of Representatives,
immediately attacked the Clinton plan.
'When you hear a Democrat call for taxes, do not ask for whom the tax rises
 -it will rise for you,' Mr Michel said, adding that the 500,000 jobs Mr
Clinton says his plan will create this year would cost the taxpayer Dollars
55,000 apiece.
Before Mr Clinton's speech administration officials mounted a spirited
defence of the programme after Tuesday's sharp fall on Wall Street. Mr Roger
Altman, deputy treasury secretary, described as 'exaggerated' reports that
middle-class Americans were going to pay a lot more.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, and
Mr Leon Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, also made
efforts to soothe market fears.
Before the speech, stock markets remained relatively calm, with the Dow
Jones Industrial Average closing 2.7 higher at 3,312.19.
Bond prices rose sharply on hopes that the measures would have a realistic
chance of passing through Congress. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
climbed  1/2 point to 100 5/16 , pushing the yield down to 7.095 per cent,
its lowest level for more than six years.
In Tokyo, shortly before the address, the dollar opened steady against the
yen and a fraction firmer against the D-Mark. There was heavy buying of US
government bonds, with prices rising steadily.
The tax package includes:
A new top-income tax rate of 36 per cent for couples earning more than
Dollars 140,000 in taxable income.
A 10 per cent surtax on taxpayers earning more than Dollars 250,000.
A rise in the corporate tax rate from 34 per cent to 36 per cent.
A new energy tax levied on the thermal content of fuels.
An expanded earned income tax credit for low-income taxpayers.
Income tax levied on 85 per cent of social security retirement payments,
instead of 50 per cent.
At the same time, Mr Clinton plans a short-term Dollars 30bn stimulus
package to create the 500,000 jobs by 1994 through a temporary investment
tax credit and an accelerated programme of public spending on
infrastructure, housing, education and the environment.
Over the long term, Mr Clinton wants to reduce government spending on
wasteful programmes and excessive administration, cutting the number of
federal jobs by 100,000, or almost 5 per cent, by 1995.
He also wants to cut more than Dollars 125bn from the five-year defence
budget outlined by the former president, Mr George Bush, and save Dollars
60bn over the same period by controlling health costs.
The impact of the new taxes will only be felt in later years: this year, new
revenues of Dollars 2.9bn will be more than offset by a temporary
incremental tax credit for large businesses and a permanent investment tax
credit for smaller businesses. The energy tax, which will be phased in in
three stages starting in July 1994, will be levied at a rate of 25.7 cents
per million British thermal units on coal, gas and nuclear energy, but at a
higher rate of 59.9 cents on oil. The tax is eventually expected to cost the
average family with an income of Dollars 40,000 a year an extra Dollars 118,
and will bring more than Dollars 22bn a year into the Treasury.
One important potential source of new revenue included in Mr Clinton's
campaign documents has been greatly scaled back: the administration now
expects to raise an additional Dollars 3.8bn over a six-year period from new
rules governing transfer pricing by foreign and US multinationals, not the
Dollars 45bn in four years Mr Clinton estimated during the campaign.
However, Treasury officials said they planned to spend Dollars 38m on hiring
more tax inspectors and doubling the rate of audits on foreign-owned
subsidiaries, in the hope that this would yield significant extra revenues.
Mr Clinton, who promised voters last year to lower taxes for the middle
class, is taking a calculated risk by presenting an economic package that
requires immediate pain in the interests of a long-term improvement in the
health of the US economy.
While components of the programme are expected to arouse fierce opposition
from affected interest groups, many members of Congress believe that their
voters want them to give the new president a chance.
The House of Representatives, where the Democrats have an 80 seat majority,
may swallow the Clinton plan as a package. In the Senate, where party
discipline is often weaker, some Democrats believe the president's best
chance of success will come if he can enlist the support of Senator Bob
Dole, the Republican leader.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Stronger retail sales lift recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, EMMA TUCKER and PHILIP STEPHENS,
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER than expected retail sales statistics yesterday lifted hopes for an
end to the recession and re-opened the debate about whether the government
should raise taxes this year.
Retail sales volumes increased by 1.6 per cent last month compared with
December, and by 2.3 per cent on the previous January in the biggest annual
rise for nearly four years.
The latest figures were released as it emerged that Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, is coming under conflicting pressures over raising taxes to cut
the government's growing budget deficit.
Mr Lamont will be cautioned by cabinet colleagues this morning not to risk
aborting economic recovery by introducing large tax increases in his March
16 budget.
But it also emerged that the Treasury is coming under pressure from
officials at the Washington-based International Monetary Fund to raise taxes
in order to cut the rising gap between government receipts and spending. The
public sector borrowing requirement is expected to rise to about Pounds 37bn
in 1992-93 from Pounds 13.7bn in 1991-92.
The Treasury indicated last night that the deficit would be reduced as the
economy recovered, and noted that underlying inflation was within the target
range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent.
However, the cabinet's traditional review of the background to the budget
will see the chancellor warn that the sharp deterioration in public finances
may force some increase in taxation in one of his two budgets this year.
That view is thought to be shared by a number of leading cabinet figures
including Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary. Many are convinced that Mr
Lamont will have no alternative but to extend VAT to goods and services
which are at present zero-rated.
But a majority of senior ministers are thought to favour delaying
significant changes until the second budget in December even if Mr Lamont
decides to 'flag' them next month.
Despite the relatively upbeat tone of the latest retail figures, sterling
fell last night to a new closing low in London against the D-Mark.
The pound slipped against the German currency on the back of expectations
about a further cut in UK interest rates, even though Mr Lamont told
journalists he had no reductions in mind.
Sterling dropped 1 1/4 pfennigs against a stronger D-Mark to a London close
of DM2.35 and eased to DM2.3489 in New York. Against the dollar, the pound
slipped by a third of a cent to Dollars 1.4440, but gained to Dollars 1.4455
in New York.
Mr Lamont welcomed the retail sales figures as 'extremely encouraging' and
said interest rates were 'at a suitable level' to keep inflation down and
were also consistent with recovery.
The seasonally adjusted retail figures from the Central Statistical Office
indicate that retailers, helped by heavy discounting, have bounced back in
recent weeks after a disappointing December in which sales volumes dropped a
revised 1 per cent on the previous month.
In the three months to the end of January, sales volumes were up 1.4 per
cent on the same period a year previously.
But underlining the patchy nature of the recent trends in the sector, sales
volumes in the three months to January 31 were up by a modest 0.2 per cent
compared with the previous three months, significantly less than the
quarterly rises seen around the middle of last year.
In the three months to January 31 compared with the previous three months,
food retailers saw sales volumes rise by 1.7 per cent while shops selling a
mixture of food and other goods reported a 2.2 per cent rise. Stores selling
clothes, shoes and household goods experienced sales drops of 2.5 per cent
and 0.7 per cent respectively over the same period.

FT  18 FEB 93 / Brussels calls for broader cuts in EC steel industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday warned EC steelmakers they would have to
close even more plants than originally envisaged if they wanted commercial
and financial support from the Community.
The call for more cuts came as the Commission unveiled a rescue package to
help protect the industry, which is suffering from overcapacity, competition
from cheap non-EC imports and the worsening recession. The EC would provide
Ecu900m (Pounds 740m) of financial support for closure costs, but only if
member states match funding promised by the Commission
The Commission refused to estimate how many jobs might be lost in the EC
industry as a result of capacity cuts, but an internal Brussels report has
suggested that the original, more modest closure programme could lead to at
least 50,000 redundancies. A German steel industry spokesman yesterday
warned that it alone might have to shed 35,000-40,000 jobs under the new
proposals.
In their original forecasts, steel producers suggested they could reduce
production of crude steel by up to 25.8m tonnes over the next three years,
and rolled products by 17.9m tonnes. Mr Bangemann said yesterday that this
was 'not sufficient', and steelmakers would have to cut a further 4m or 5m
tonnes of capacity. Altogether, the Commission is looking for cuts of up to
30m tonnes in crude steel, and about 19m tonnes in rolled steel.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert,
responsible for competition, said they hoped the plan would receive the
political backing of industry ministers at a special meeting next week.
However, in an indication of the political sensitivity of the issue, they
will not ask member states to take a formal decision on the rescue package
before May.
Mr Fernand Braun, the EC's 'steel envoy', is to renew contacts with 70
steelmakers in the hope that they can offer more capacity cuts to satisfy
the Commission before the May meeting. The producers will be asked to commit
themselves to a binding closure programme by the end of September, and to
carry it out by the end of 1995.
The draft programme approved yesterday includes controversial plans to
reduce alleged unfair competition from cheap steel imports from eastern
Europe. Mr Bangemann said the EC will ask the Czech and Slovak republics,
Hungary and Poland to impose minimum prices on steel exports to the EC over
the next three years - or face anti-dumping duties. He denied the Community
was backtracking on its commitment to encourage fair and free trade with
eastern Europe.
Demands for greater cuts by the industry will go down particularly badly in
Spain, which has still not received EC approval for controversial plans to
subsidise new steel-making capacity, in exchange for cuts elsewhere. Mr Van
Miert said yesterday he hoped the Spanish would recognise that other
countries' industries were also expected to make sacrifices as part of an
overall programme.
Mr Van Miert warned member states to avoid the temptation to 'renationalise'
the steel sector, through subsidies.

<TEXT>
TAYLOR Woodrow yesterday raised Pounds 55.5m through a debenture issue in a
rare move by a construction group to borrow money through bonds secured on a
property portfolio.
The bonds were added to an existing debenture issue, first launched in 1989.
The company raised Pounds 80m at that stage, though it later bought back
Pounds 35m of the bonds to record a Pounds 7.5m profit.
Explaining the decision to issue more of the long-dated bonds, which are due
to mature in October 2014, Mr David Green, finance director, said:
'Historically, these are the lowest long-term interest rates in 25 years. I
doubt very much that they will go very much lower.'
The bonds were issued with a yield of 10.037 per cent.
Institutional investors in the UK, who buy such bonds to match future
pension or insurance liabilities, would be resistant to buying bonds that
yield less than 10 per cent, suggesting that this is a good time to borrow,
said Mr Green.
The money will be used to repay a sterling eurobond.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Goldman Sachs wins key role
in Repsol share sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPSOL, the Spanish state-controlled energy group, yesterday appointed the
US investment bank Goldman Sachs as global co-ordinator of a planned share
issue that is expected to raise at least Dollars 500m.
The decision to appoint a separate co-ordinator - Lazard continues to advise
on the overall management of the transaction - reflects the scale and
complexity of the deal, which is likely to have one of the biggest
international distributions of any share issue this year.
More than three-quarters of the shares are expected to be sold abroad in the
first large Spanish share issue targeted exclusively at institutional
investors.
Previous privatisation issues have been sold mainly to retail investors in
Spain, involving lengthy underwriting periods and a fixed price for the
shares.
The latest Repsol offer, by contrast, will be the first Spanish share sale
to be conducted on the international book-building model.
The placement, which is likely to reduce state-held equity in Repsol from a
54.5 per cent to around 47.5 per cent, will be divided into five tranches -
Spain, the US, the UK, continental Europe and the rest of the world.
Analysts believe it will be weighted strongly towards Wall Street.
The issue is due in the first half of the year, though the good market
conditions at present mean that the sale is likely to be launched early,
perhaps as soon as the end of next month.
In an attempt to spread the spoils of the placement among the domestic
banking sector, Repsol named Banco Bilbao Vizcaya as joint global
co-ordinator and appointed the rival big commercial bank, Banco Central
Hispano, lead manager of the Spanish tranche.
Banco Santander de Negocios, Spain's premier merchant bank, will jointly
lead the UK tranche with SG Warburg.
Goldman Sachs co-ordinated the placement of 26 per cent of Repsol's shares
in 1989.
It also led a subsequent major flotation by Endesa, the state-controlled
electrical utility.
The renewed business that Goldman Sachs has won from Repsol underlines the
pre-eminence that the US bank has established in major Spanish deals.
Repsol said that Paribas and Credit Suisse First Boston would be joint
leaders of the continental Europe tranche.
Morgan Stanley has been entrusted with the placement in the rest of the
world, it added.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Timex suspends threat to sack 300
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT at the Dundee-based Timex Electronics plant yesterday issued and
withdrew a threat to sack about 300 striking workers pending the outcome of
a mass meeting of the workforce to be held this morning.
The factory's 500 production workers are in their third week of an all-out
strike over management's decision to lay off 200 of them - including all the
shop stewards and the factory convener - after the US-owned company
experienced a 'prolonged' downturn in demand.
Timex said: 'Management were intending to issue dismissal notices to about
300 striking workers.' The company had agreed to 'delay' issuing the notices
ahead of today's mass meeting at the request of the AEEU engineering and
electrical union.
It is understood the workforce will consider a previously rejected
four-point peace plan that was drawn up by management in both Dundee and in
the parent Timex Corporation in Walterbury, Connecticut.
The package offered employees a 50 per cent share in this year's profits and
arbitration on the issue of lay-offs, following an immediate return to work
in return for a cut in fringe benefits and a wage freeze for the rest of the
year, the company said.
Earlier, scuffles briefly broke out between police attempting to keep the
roads around the factory clear and pickets. Police said the incident had not
resulted in any injuries or arrests.
As many as 305,344 workers have lost their jobs in manufacturing industry
over the past two years, according to the latest job-loss survey by the
Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union published yesterday.
A total of 33,352 went in 377 different companies between October 9 last
year and Monday of this week, with the largest contractions being in London
and the south-east and the west Midlands.
Mr Bill Jordan, the union's president, said the figures showed the jobs
crisis in Britain was deepening.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COCA-Cola Enterprises, the world's largest bottler of Coca-Cola products,
reported an increase in operating income in the fourth quarter, although
special charges and other considerations led to a per share loss.
Operating profit, excluding required accounting charges, rose to Dollars
181m, up from an adjusted Dollars 121m a year earlier. For the year the
operating profit came to Dollars 725m excluding one-time special charges, up
from Dollars 667m. Fourth quarter sales were Dollars 1.3bn, up from Dollars
1.2bn. For the year, sales were barely changed at Dollars 5.1bn, compared
with Dollars 5bn.
The bottler, 44 per cent owned by the Coca-Cola Company, underwent extensive
restructuring in 1992, trimming administrative staff and decentralising
operations. It said the weak US economy and unusually cool, wet weather, cut
soft drink demand.
Mr Summerfield Johnston, chief executive, said: 'We view a 9 per cent
increase in cash operating profit as tangible evidence of the company's
progress.'

FT  17 FEB 93 / CGIP seeks higher CarnaudMetalbox stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CGIP, the French holding company, confirmed it is considering raising its
stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the packaging company, by buying shares from
MB-Caradon, the UK building products group, but stressed that it would not
buy all of MB-Caradon's 25.3 per cent holding.
Pechiney, the French state-controlled packaging group, has emerged as a
potential purchaser for another part of the MB-Caradon stake. Mr Jean
Gandois, chairman, said Pechiney could 'not remain aloof' from the
situation.
MB-Caradon announced on Monday that it planned to seek shareholders'
permission to sell its stake in CarnaudMetalbox. CGIP already owns 25.3 per
cent of CarnaudMetalbox and has pre-emptive rights over MB-Caradon's shares.
The Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV), the market watchdog, yesterday
stipulated that if CPIG raised its stake by more than 7 per cent it would be
forced to mount a full bid for CarnaudMetalbox. CGIP said there was
'absolutely no question' of a full bid.
MB-Caradon hopes to secure shareholders' approval to sell its
CarnaudMetalbox holding, valued yesterday at Pounds 505.5m (Dollars 725m),
at an extraordinary general meeting on March 4. There is speculation that
MB-Caradon has already lined up a potential purchaser.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Pacific, the transport, resources and industrial holdings group,
has bought Compagnie Maritime Belge's 43 per cent stake in their joint
venture Canada Maritime - the container shipping service which operates
between Montreal and several European ports.
The price of the deal was not disclosed, but CP also acquired two older
container vessels from CMB.
Canada Maritime was formed by CP and CMB in 1984 in a broad consolidation of
north Atlantic container services following the severe 1982-83 recession.
Container rates hit new lows last year but north American shipping lines
have pushed container rates up by 10 to 15 per cent and this has improved
returns.
Eastbound traffic is firming, say shipping sources, but westbound is still
very depressed.
The Canada-Europe container service will continue to be dominated by Cast
North America and Canada Maritime, now fully owned by CP.

updating of network

BELLSOUTH, the largest of the Baby Bell regional telephone companies that
was spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984, yesterday unveiled plans to spend up to
Dollars 9bn during the next three years updating its telecommunications
network.
The Atlanta-based company said Dollars 5.7bn would be spent to keep up with
the business' growth and to replace outdated equipment, and another Dollars
3bn would be invested in newer technology for the network infrastructure.
Some of the money will go towards the installation of more fibre optic cable
and the continued replacement of analog central offices with digital
equipment.
So far, BellSouth has installed 900,000 miles of fibre optic cable in its US
network and plans to install fibre-to-the-curb systems for 130,000
residential and business customers over the next three years.
The incorporation of self-healing capabilities into the network to enhance
reliability will also continue under the capital investment programme.
In a separate development, BellSouth said it has signed preliminary
agreements with Intel, RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson Telephone to develop new
products and services for the mobile computing market.
The four companies said they planned to expand the availability and increase
the usage of standard Intel processor-based mobile computers able to perform
two-way wireless communications via the nationwide dedicated public mobile
data networks run by RAM.

CIGNA, one of the largest composite insurance companies in the US, yesterday
announced a sharp drop in fourth quarter earnings to Dollars 50m, down from
Dollars 108m a year earlier, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Full year 1992 profits of Dollars 311m were also well down on the previous
year, when the company earned Dollars 449m, although the latest results were
depressed by a Dollars 26m charge to cover the adoption of new accounting
standards.
Cigna's earnings would have been considerably worse but for realised
investment gains, which brought in Dollars 19m in the fourth quarter and
Dollars 192m in the year. Investment gains in 1991 netted only Dollars 52m.
The company said its property and casualty operations incurred a loss of
Dollars 374m last year, despite investment gains of Dollars 111m.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cummins forges diesel engine
link with Komatsu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUMMINS ENGINE of the US and Komatsu, Japan's biggest construction equipment
group, yesterday announced agreement in principle to establish a
co-operative business relationship in diesel engines.
The deal is one of the most important recent link-ups in the diesel
industry, and represents the first significant co-operation between a
western diesel engine producer and an integrated Japanese user and producer
of engines.
The announcement raised questions among observers on which company would be
gaining most from the arrangement, and which of Cummins' plants would be
affected.
But Mr Henry Schacht, Cummins' chairman and chief executive, said the deal
was both mutually beneficial and a 'logical extension of the pressures being
exerted on diesel engine producers and end-users.' It was a deal, he
indicated, that would not have been contemplated 15 years ago.
The diesel engine industry has been spending heavily to produce engines that
comply with increasingly tough emissions regulations.
The two companies said yesterday they would 'apply their technological
expertise to the joint development of high-quality engines able to meet the
standards of tomorrow's diesel engine industry'.
Cummins and Komatsu have had links since the 1960s. The Japanese company was
a Cummins licensee before it developed its own engines in the 1980s, while
Cummins already supplies engines to Komatsu in the US, Latin America and
part of the Japanese company's European production at Birtley in the UK.
But the latest relationship, which has been under discussion for several
years, goes much deeper. The companies plan to review their product lines,
eliminating areas of redundant investment and reducing costs by unifying
certain engine models and promoting combined production.
As a first step, the two companies are considering producing Cummins' small
B series engines in Japan, to be installed in Komatsu equipment or sold by
Cummins in its regional markets.
They are also considering producing a large Komatsu engine at an unnamed
Cummins facility with distribution planned through the Cummins network. In
the UK, Cummins' Daventry plant would appear to have the best chance of
getting the work.
Mr Schacht said both companies would benefit by being freed from the need to
develop these engines. For Cummins, the deal offers increased volumes to
support its technical spending and local production in Japan, while Komatsu
gets access to Cummins' diesel engine expertise.
Mr Allan Rawnsley, a UK-based consultant, said Cummins had spent heavily to
comply with emissions regulations. The deal with Komatsu was a low-cost
route to replacing the ageing 28-litre Vee-form engines, currently made only
in India.
The two companies said the new relationship would lead to joint ventures in
Japan and the US. They hope to reach a definitive agreement later this year.

half

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EDPER Enterprises and Pagurian, two leading holding companies in the
business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, have cut their
quarterly common share dividends in half.
The cuts reflect a thinning stream of dividend income and shrinking cash
resources in the upper layers of the Bronfman group.
Several operating companies, most notably in the property and financial
services sectors, have reduced their common dividends in the past year.
Bramalea, a property developer, has halted preferred dividends.
Edper, which is Mr Peter Bronfman's top public company, is reducing its
dividend to 20 cents a share from 40 cents. Pagurian, the main vehicle for
the Bronfmans' senior managers to participate as shareholders in the group,
has cut its dividend to 7.5 cents from 15 cents.
Mr Edward Bronfman, brother of Mr Peter Bronfman, has a minority interest of
19 per cent in Edper.
The top Bronfman companies have also lost an important source of dividend
income with last week's sale of the group's 38 per cent stake in John
Labatt, the brewer. Labatt has recently contributed about CDollars 32m
(Dollars 25.3m) a year to Brascan, its immediate holding company.

<TEXT>
OCE-VAN DER Grinten, the Dutch copier and office systems maker, said net
profit for the full year 1992 fell 14 per cent due to the weak economic
climate and unfavourable currency exchange rates, AP-DJ reports from
Amsterdam.
The company said net profit for the year slipped to Fl 87.3m (Dollars 48m)
from Fl 100.9m a year earlier.
The company said it was pressured by greater competition, lower margins, and
a strong guilder.
Meanwhile, net profit per share fell 16 per cent to Fl 5.49m a share from Fl
6.58 a year ago.
Oce said a dividend totalling Fl 2.25 per ordinary share, unchanged from
1991, would be paid.
Sales increased 3 per cent to Fl 2.66bn from Fl 2.58bn. This growth was due
in part to a broader range of goods, which Oce had been building up over
previous years to broaden its market share.
Oce noted that weakness in the US market had an unfavorable impact on Oce
Office Systems, its US division.
Although interest income from leasing activities rose 52 per cent, to Fl
72.9m from Fl 47.8m, that increase was in part offset by higher financing
costs, which rose 6 per cent to Fl 82.8m from Fl 76.5m.
*****
BP Oil Espana, the Spanish unit of the oil company British Petroleum, has
agreed to sell 30 per cent of Productos Quimicos del Mediterraneo SA
(Proquimed), its chemical subsidiary to Ube Industries, the Japanese
industrial group, AP-DJ reports from Madrid.
The sale will take place this year. No financial details were given.
Proquimed is Spain's sole producer of the chemical caprolactam, used in
making synthetic fibers.
Ube Industries is a world leader in caprolactam production, BP Oil Espana
said. It acquired Proquimed in 1991.
*****
Allianz, the German insurer, said its expansion plans would be focused on
east and south-east Asia in geographic terms and on lifting its position in
industrial insurance, Reuter reports from Munich.
'We want to expand our basis in Asia,' Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, the
managing board chairman, said. Allianz has subsidiaries in Japan, Singapore,
Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand. 'But that is not enough,' he said.
*****
Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, has bought 30 per cent of
the shares in Indelec, a Spanish mobile phones and transmission equipment
maker, Reuter reports from Stockholm. No financial details were disclosed.
Telefonica de Espana, the Spanish state telephone company which owns 30 per
cent of Indelec, will have to sell its stake by 1995 to comply with European
Community rules.
Ericsson would then probably be able to increase its stake, according to
Ericsson.

the first time, after a fall in its net asset value for the third successive
year.
The group said yesterday that its net asset value at December 31, 1992 was
estimated at SKr11.5bn (Dollars 1.6bn), down 20 per cent from SKr14.4bn the
previous year, and down nearly 42 per cent from SKr19.7bn in 1989.
Skandia has paid a dividend every year since it was founded in 1855, with
the 1991 payout totalling SKr4 per share.
The company yesterday declined to comment on its dividend policy.
The group's shares fell SKr8 to SKr109 yesterday.
Skandia said a sharp fall in the value of its Swedish and foreign real
estate portfolios was one of the main reasons for the decline in net asset
value last year.
It blamed losses associated with its 48 per cent stake in Svenska Kredit and
its 26 per cent holding in International Credit, two credit insurance
operations which collapsed during 1992.
A final factor was the impact of hurricane Andrew in the US, which pushed up
claims costs and led to a sharp deterioration in the group's international
insurance result.
Mr Bjorn Wolrath, the chief executive, said the group would continue with
its reorganisation strategy, which has seen it disclose plans to halve its
international non-life reinsurance operations over two years.
He said it planned a further concentration of its international business
operations, but did not elaborate.
'The reorganisation which we are now in the process of implementing, coupled
with falling interest rates makes me believe that we have the possibility to
achieve growth once again in the net asset value of the shareholder
operations in 1993,' Mr Wolrath said.
He added that the group's Nordic operations were continuing to perform well
and lower interest rates and rising share prices were improving the returns
of the Swedish Skandia Life activities.
Skandia will announce its preliminary result on March 18. In the first half
of 1992, the group's management operating result was a SKr636m loss.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Mrs Fields' shareholders left with just the
crumbs / A look at the background to the financial restructuring of the US
cookie maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUMBLE all-American chocolate chip cookie does not travel well, as UK
investors have found out to their expense.
This week's news of a financial restructuring at Mrs Fields, the
controversial USM-quoted cookie company, leaves 1,700 UK investors with
nothing more than a nominal holding in a private company owned and managed
by US banks.
Shareholders have also been told that they can expect no dividend until the
banks have been repaid. Just when that might be is still somewhat of an open
question, even for the banks concerned.
Most of those left holding what one shareholder called 'virtually worthless
paper' are private individuals, with only three large UK institutions on the
register.
Ignoring the warning bells of a disastrous flotation in the spring of 1986,
they rushed to buy in the following year amid the hype of one product wonder
stocks such as Sock Shop and Tie Rack.
The company's ability to meet the forecast on which it was floated was taken
as a good sign. Its shares rose from a low of 105p to 272p in June 1987,
against a flotation price of 140p.
Within months, however, cracks in the company's strategy began to appear. An
ambitious expansion programme was reversed as rents soared, branches
languished and the economy took a nosedive. Little more than four years
after its market debut, Mrs Fields was forced to sit down with bankers to
hammer out a survival strategy.
This week it became clear that the company has been all but bankrupt for
some time, in spite of a shift toward less capital intensive franchising and
licensing operations. One significant UK shareholder said it had written the
investment off in 1990, a year before the shares were suspended at 10p.
The agreement announced on Monday has taken two years to negotiate. Mrs
Fields, the high profile founder of the company, and her husband, Randall,
had already pledged most of their 80 per cent stake to the banks to keep the
business afloat. But the banks will return control of an 8.4 per cent stake
to her over the next three years as long as she remains with the company.
Mrs Fields will remain as chairwoman, albeit on a slightly reduced salary of
Dollars 450,000 a year. The banks have decided apparently that to lose her
face from marketing campaigns would be like losing Anita Roddick from the
Body Shop, said one observer.
This logic was also behind the decision to cancel 'interaffiliate' debts of
Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 10.2m) - basically monies owed by companies controlled
by the Fields. Her husband, who resigned as chairman in March 1991, has also
had his compensation package reduced.
For shareholders, there is little solace in the terms agreed by the banks.
After the refinancing, the group will still have debt of Dollars 50m with a
Dollars 64.5m deficit in shareholders funds. It is certain to be some time
before even the banks can begin to think of getting a return.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Customs seize jet parts destined for Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS AND Excise officers are interviewing a number of UK businessmen
after seizing about 12,000 counterfeit engine parts for US-made Iranian jet
fighters.
The Customs investigation is centred on a company called DBI based near
Maidenhead, Berks. The company is run by Mr Richard Patrick, a Canadian-born
former wing commander.
The Customs and Excise Department refused last night to comment on the
investigation.
Customs have seized about 7,500 compressor blades for Northrop F-5 fighter
engines with a sale value of about Dollars 1m.
The parts were ordered by the Iranian government's foreign procurement
mangement centre and the end user is believed to be the Iranian Air Force,
which operates 65 ageing F-5E and F-5Fs.
The blades are copies of parts made by General Electric of the US. The
company said last night it had been contacted by UK Customs officials
following the seizure of the blades to help in their identification.
A General Electric representative based in the UK was instrumental in
identifying the unmarked blades as copies of those used for a J85 engine
used in F-5 fighter aircraft. General Electric ceased manufacturing the
blades in 1987.
DBI subcontracted the work to two unidentified engineering companies which
apparently did not know the parts were destined for Iran.
Mr Patrick, 75, has been investigated previously by Customs officers. On the
last occasion in 1988 a prosecution was withdrawn when he agreed to pay a
Pounds 40,000 customs penalty for exporting ball bearings for Iranian jet
aircraft.
The previous investigation involved a company called Dixie Barings
International, then based at Heathrow.
Mr Patrick, who could not be contacted last night, was reported in the
magazine to have said that the Iranians told him the blades were for use on
civilian Fokker F27 aircraft.
Fokker said in the same report it had no knowledge of any kit designed to
convert the propeller-driven F27 to be driven by jet engines.
Six businessmen were initially charged after the previous customs
investigation into Mr Patrick's exports, but all are understood to have
reached a 'compounded settlement' with Customs which involves paying hefty
penalties in return for the withdrawal of the prosecution.
Sales of military spare parts, such as the blades for engines, to Iran have
been subject to embargoes in the US and the UK both following the 1979
revolution and as a result of the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq in
the 1980s.
One defence industry expert in the US said last night that the embargoes
were unlikely to be lifted while Tehran persisted in its death threat
against Salman Rushdie.
In Tehran Mr Akbar Torkan, the minister of defence, made clear recently,
however, his country's overwhelming need for spare parts for equipment
bought from the US before the downfall of the Shah in 1979.
The Iranian Air Force includes among its aircraft some 60 F-4D and Es, and a
further 60 F-5 Es and Fs in addition to squadrons of more modern F-14s and
MiG-29s.
Details of the investigation appear in today's issue of Flight International
magazine.
Mr Andrew Chuter, the editor, said: 'These are quite old aeroplanes and they
are quite old engines used in them. But to actually make the blades, which
are the most important parts of the engine, is probably beyond them, so they
have to look elsewhere.
'They can't get them from the Americans because of the embargo. So they have
clearly decided to get them engineered elsewhere. It's reverse engineering
or it's pirated - call it what you want.
'Because this is mid 1950s technology we are talking about steel compressor
blades - rather than the state-of-the-art stuff today which might be
titanium or composites - the materials are probably not exotic as they are
these days.'

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Framatome earnings fall to
FFr900m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRAMATOME, the state-controlled French nuclear reactor group, yesterday
reported a fall in net profits to just over FFr900m (Dollars 164.6m) last
year from FFr980m in 1991 because of the continuing contraction of the
nuclear reactor market.
Mr Jean-Claude Leny, chairman, told Les Echos, the French financial
newspaper, that, in spite of the fall in profits, Framatome had performed
better than expected last year. The group experienced a sharp fall in sales
to FFr12.5bn in 1992 from FFr14.2bn in 1991.
Framatome received a substantial nuclear order, its first for some time, at
the start of this year and late last month won a Dollars 120m steam
generator replacement contract from Asco of Spain for its Framatome-Siemens
consortium.
However, Mr Leny warned that 1993 would be more difficult than 1992 because
of the continuing economic pressures.
He said he did not envisage a recovery until 1994.
Mr Leny was concerned that Framatome's position in China, one of the few
buoyant markets for nuclear reactors, could be imperiled by the row between
France and China over the sale late last year of 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter
jets to Taiwan by Dassault, the French state-controlled aircraft maker.
The Framatome chairman told Les Echos that French companies 'have not yet
stopped paying' for the damage to Sino-French relations. However, there were
signs this week of an improvement when Alcatel, the telecommunications
equipment division of Alcatel-Alsthom, the state-controlled industrial group
that owns 44 per cent of Framatome, won Dollars 400m of contracts in China.
Alcatal Alsthom saw net sales rise to FFr161.65bn in 1992 from FFr160.08bn
in 1991. The group said it had suffered from the strengthening of the franc
after the autumn currency crisis.
The level of orders was virtually stable at FFr166bn last year, against
FFr165.3bn in 1991.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Salvation Army claims Pounds 6m fraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALVATION Army said yesterday it had become the victim of an Dollars
8.8m (Pounds 6.19m) fraud.
A writ issued in the High Court alleges that Tilen Securities Inc, Mr Stuart
Christopher Ford of Birmingham, its owner, and Mr Gamil Naguib conspired to
defraud the Salvation Army of the money. The Salvation Army refused to give
details of its relationship with the three defendants. It said that in spite
of repeated requests for money owed to it, only Dollars 500,000 had been
repaid.
Mr John Larsson, the head of the charity in the UK, said it had no
alternative but to take legal action to seek recovery of the restof the
money.
The High Court action follows proceedings initiated by the charity in
Luxembourg last month, when bank accounts containing about Dollars 520,000
were frozen. The legal action has the support of the Charity Commission. The
Salvation Army has asked Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, to
investigate.
The charity, which is the largest provider of social services after the
government, last year had an income of almost Pounds 80m, of which Pounds
12m came from public donations.
Mr Larsson said: 'I firmly believe that the public will see that we are
acting decisively and will continue to give us the magnificent support for
which we have always been so grateful.'
None of those named on the writ could be contacted for comment last night.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CGIP, the French holding company, confirmed it is considering raising its
stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the packaging company, by buying shares from
MB-Caradon, the UK building products group, but stressed that it would not
buy all of MB-Caradon's 25.3 per cent holding.
Pechiney, the French state-controlled packaging group, has emerged as a
potential purchaser for another part of the MB-Caradon stake. Mr Jean
Gandois, chairman, said Pechiney could 'not remain aloof' from the
situation.
MB-Caradon announced on Monday that it planned to seek shareholders'
permission to sell its stake in CarnaudMetalbox. CGIP already owns 25.3 per
cent of CarnaudMetalbox and has pre-emptive rights over MB-Caradon's shares.
The Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV), the market watchdog, yesterday
stipulated that if CPIG raised its stake by more than 7 per cent it would be
forced to mount a full bid for CarnaudMetalbox. CGIP said there was
'absolutely no question' of a full bid.
MB-Caradon hopes to secure shareholders' approval to sell its
CarnaudMetalbox holding, valued yesterday at Pounds 505.5m (Dollars 725m),
at an extraordinary general meeting on March 4. There is speculation that
MB-Caradon has already lined up a potential purchaser.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Japan cool on UN peacekeeping plea: Boutros Ghali asks
Miyazawa to send troops to Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, yesterday
asked Japan to play a bigger part in world peacekeeping, saying this would
help counter complaints that the UN was dominated by the US, Reuter reports
from Tokyo.
But Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, facing strong domestic opposition to a
wider role for the Japanese army, responded cautiously in a meeting with the
visiting UN chief.
He said Japan would not hurry to expand its participation in UN peacekeeping
activities, which began last year when a contingent went to Cambodia.
Mr Boutros Ghali specifically asked Mr Miyazawa to send troops to
Mozambique, after earlier suggesting in a Japanese television interview that
it commit troops to Somalia also.
'I think the situation in Mozambique meets your country's condition (for
sending troops),' Mr Boutros Ghali told Mr Miyazawa. 'There is a solid
ceasefire agreement and operations are under way for rehabilitation of
refugees.'
So far only 100 UN peacekeepers are overseeing the formerly Marxist
country's transition to democracy. The force will eventually number more
than 7,000. The government and Renamo rebels signed a peace pact last
October.
Earlier, Mr Boutros Ghali suggested Japan commit troops to Somalia, where he
envisages a new type of peacekeeping operation.
Mr Boutros Ghali has suggested that conventional peacekeeping operations be
upgraded to 'peace-enforcing operations' which would allow the UN to act
without the consent of warring factions.
Mr Boutros Ghali and Mr Miyazawa did not discuss the question of sending
Japanese troops to Somalia.
The UN chief said the world body was undergoing a crisis of confidence
because some member states have accused it of coming under the sway of a
lone superpower.
'That is why we need the participation of countries like Germany, Japan and
Brazil in these and other United Nations operations,' he said.
Mr Miyazawa said post-war Japan had vowed never again to become a key
military power and should not rapidly expand its participation in
peacekeeping operations.
Japan's peacekeeping law, enacted last year after 20 months of wrangling in
parliament, forbids troops from taking part in United Nations combat duties.

RISING unemployment, increasing foreign debt and lower private consumption
will characterise the Finnish economy in 1993, the finance ministry said
yesterday. It predicted flat GDP this year, overturning a forecast 2 per
cent growth made last October. But it expects the economy to grow 3 per cent
next year. Private consumption will fall 4 per cent in 1993 and unemployment
peak at 450,000 (20 per cent of the workforce). Foreign debt is predicted to
rise to FM250bn (Dollars 42bn), with net interest payments on it amounting
to FM27bn this year.
State borrowing requirement for the year is put at almost FM80bn (nearly 50
per cent of GDP) against 16.5 per cent at the end of 1991. Exports are
predicted to rise 11 per cent this year. The banking sector's combined
credit losses will be about FM20bn this year against FM21bn in 1992.

<TEXT>
The UN relief operation in Bosnia yesterday remained deadlocked over the
Serb blockade of besieged Moslem enclaves, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
For the third day, Serb commanders refused to allow the passage of emergency
aid across Serb lines to Cerska, a Moslem stronghold in eastern Bosnia.
The British government condemned the Bosnian Serbs for their continued
blockade and called on Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to exert
pressure on them to allow the free passage of aid.
In a sharply worded protest, British diplomats in Belgrade, the Serbian
capital, reminded Mr Milosevic of his pledges to let aid through to Moslem
enclaves.
The UN yesterday accused the Bosnian government of playing political games
with their boycott as warehouses reached full capacity in Sarajevo.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UN, EC push for autonomy solution: Krajina Serbs urged to
drop calls for independence from Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS and European Community mediators have advised representatives
of the Krajina Serbs to drop demands for independence from Croatia if they
want to reach a durable peace settlement with Croatia at talks which began
at the UN yesterday.
Instead, the mediators are pushing for a solution under which the Krajina
Serbs, like the Albanian majority in Kosovo, would be given a large measure
of autonomy within Croatia, in the first case, and Serbia in the second.
There could be no question of a change in national borders unless they were
agreed by all parties involved, a conference spokesman said.
Krajina Serbs, represented by Mr Goran Hadzic and Mr Mile Paspalj,
respectively self-styled president of the assembly and foreign minister,
began the presentation of their case to Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord David Owen
yesterday before Croatian representatives join the negotiations tonight or
on Thursday.
The international mediators, already heavily involved in the search for a
solution of the Bosnian conflict, have been asked by Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the UN secretary-general, also to broker an agreement between the
Croats and the Krajina Serbs as a basis for a long-term renewal of the UN
protection force's mandate in Croatia.
Pending such an agreement, Mr Boutros Ghali has proposed an interim
extension of the Unprofor mandate, due to expire on February 21, until March
31.
Last week Mr Boutros Ghali indicated that the failure to implement the
original UN peacekeeping plan of January 2, 1992, and to negotiate a
settlement of the conflict between Croatia and the Serb populations living
in UN protected areas and Serb-controlled so-called 'pink zones,' were at
the root of the problem. They were among the main causes of the recent Croat
offensive in Krajina.
Reuter adds: Mr Vance is expected to quit the peace talks once the New York
stage of negotiations is completed, diplomats said last night.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Czech Republic prepares to alter bankruptcy law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CZECH government is preparing to revise the country's bankruptcy law to
protect companies facing serious financial difficulties. Unamended, the
existing law could force hundreds of companies out of business.
The law was approved by the former Czechoslovak parliament last year, and
ministers are expected to discuss draft amendments today. The government
wants the revised law in place by April 20, when current provisions expire,
Mr Karel Dyba, minister for the economy, said in an interview with the
Financial Times.
The need to amend the law is highlighted by a recent spate of calls by large
companies for urgent financial help from the government.
Many companies are locked in a circle of bad debt caused by unpaid bills
from customers. Some of the biggest Czech companies whose main markets were
in the former Soviet Union and other communist countries have been
particularly badly hit by the collapse of these markets. They cannot pay
their bills to suppliers who threaten to cut off essential supplies.
Officials fear that many other companies could be affected if major
companies, which have called on the government for urgent financial help,
are allowed to go bankrupt.
'We want to avoid a chain reaction, but a little more pressure on a
non-paying company is needed. It's a question of how big a dose of medicine
needs to be given,' Mr Dyba said.
He rejected suggestions that thousands of companies are near bankruptcy.
'That's rubbish. Nobody has the data. People talk about inter-enterprise
debt as too high, but it's quite normal in a market economy. One should not
worry too much about its increase. The real problem is bad debts of some
enterprises to banks. That's what we must solve.'
The government wants the law to allow out-of-court settlements. 'The
(revised) law will force interested parties to act and give them time to
reach out-of-court settlements.'
The courts were overburdened with thousands of bad debt cases, and had
neither the capacity nor the ability to solve all these problems, he said.
The revised law may allow companies initially to pay back only part of their
debt. The government wants the National Property Fund, responsible for
privatisations and a big shareholder in many companies, and the
Consolidation Bank, set up to deal with state-owned companies' bad debts, to
help by taking equity in companies threatened by bankruptcy or by providing
finance.
The government may intervene directly if there was a clear company
commitment to resolve its financial situation. 'But there will be no
bailing-out without guarantees,' said Mr Dyba, adding that the government's
role would be that of a catalyst.
Government intervention would be limited to at most 12 big companies.
A solution would have to involve 'sharing the burden among workers,
managers, owners or would-be owners, the banks and the government.'

Ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries said they
had agreed to cut oil output by around 1.4m barrels of oil per day in an
attempt to rescue weak petroleum prices. Current output is estimated near 25
million bpd.
The deal, which came after four days of bargaining, also brought Kuwait back
into the group's system of production quotas, from which the emirate had
been exempt as it rebuilt from the 1991 Gulf War. Earlier story, Page 20

FT  17 FEB 93 / Letter: Subcontractors victims of Dutch auctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN W CLARKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Taylor's story ('Builders 'forced to bid 10 per cent below
cost'', February 9) pinpoints exactly the untenable situation that
subcontractors in the construction industry have been suffering for many
years. The present recessionary times only make the pain more intense.
It is the case that construction companies 'Dutch-auction' their offers for
tender to specialist engineering contractors such as members of our
association, in order to gain work at a sub-economic price. They then use
the subcontractors' money to fund their own deficits.
From the Dutch auction process they follow up by forcing through onerous
contract clauses, including 'pay-when-paid' terms, late overall payment,
withholding of retention money and many other abuses. A recent survey of our
members showed that just 257 companies are currently owed Pounds 48m in
retention money alone. It is certainly time that these issues were more
fully presented to a wider audience rather than the situation that has
existed hitherto, where the main players have largely been talking to
themselves.
It is to be hoped that the government's construction industry inquiry, long
germinating, will finally begin its work and, in consultation with all
parties, put an end to these practices.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Letter: Policy aims to minimise weapons destruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAN PLESCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his excellent article 'A disarming achievement' (February 12), David
White comments: 'Surplus armoured vehicles, artillery weapons and aircraft
covered by the terms of CFE have to be destroyed in the next three years.'
This is correct, but hides the fact that Nato is using every means at its
disposal to minimise the numbers of weapons to be destroyed. Under the
policy known as 'Cascade', Nato countries whose forces exceed the CFE
treaty-limited equipment (TLE) quotas pass on, free of charge, their surplus
weapons to Nato countries with sub-TLE forces. The beneficiaries of this
policy have thus far been Greece and Turkey: 916 tanks, 150 armoured combat
vehicles, 72 artillery systems and 100 mortar systems cascading into Greece;
and 1,057 tanks, 600 armoured combat vehicles and 71 artillery systems
cascading into Turkey. This represents a massive modernisation of these
nations' forces at the time when every thoughtful analyst fears they may be
dragged into war with each other over Macedonia and Kosovo.
Responding to these fears, the UK defence secretary, Malcolm Rifkind wrote,
in a letter to Basic: 'I do not see that the tragic events in the former
Yugoslavia provide a reason to change the rationale for the programme.'
These words may well come back to haunt him.
Cascade, however, is indicative rather than exceptional. Germany is
assisting in a rearmament of Hungary. No one in NATO seems to believe these
policies are problematic, though concern is voiced when the former Soviet
Union states do the same thing.
The scale of these Nato-blessed arms transfers far outweighs, and flatly
contradicts, any tentative positive steps towards peace-keeping recently
made by the alliance.

FT  17 FEB 93 / A cause without Delors: Europe must launch a 'crusade for
democracy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was one memorable phrase in Mr Jacques Delors' speech to the European
Parliament last week. Unfortunately, it was embedded in a passage of classic
Euro-speak.
After proclaiming that 'democracy, subsidiarity and transparency were the
European Commission's watchwords', Mr Delors went on to say: 'With an eye to
the next institutional reform, scheduled for January 1996, I feel obliged to
point out that, had the 1991 intergovernmental conference accepted the
Commission's idea of a hierarchy of norms, the subsidiarity principle could
have been applied more rationally.' If that sentence is transparent, my
name's Norman Tebbit.
But in the next sentence came the memorable phrase. The Commission, said Mr
Delors, 'intends to conduct this crusade for democracy'. Although the word
'crusade' was perhaps ill-chosen, given the unfavourable connotations it has
for Europe's Moslem inhabitants, something like a 'crusade for democracy' is
desperately needed.
Yet the Commission is ill-placed, and Mr Delors himself ill-qualified, to
lead such a crusade. I do not question his democratic convictions, but his
language, his public image and his past career are essentially those of a
technocrat. He rose to political office in France via the civil service and
a series of 'technical adviser' roles. Not coincidentally, this was also the
preferred role of the EC's founding father, Jean Monnet. Throughout its
history the EC has been a brilliant conspiracy of Europe's governing elites.
Each step forward in its history has been the work of an intergovernmental
conference (IGC), at which national governments negotiated a treaty. Each
successive treaty has amended or enlarged the preceding one.
The result is a text of ever-growing complexity, largely incomprehensible to
ordinary people. That in itself should not matter. Most acts of national
parliaments are no easier for the layman to follow without expert guidance.
But we accept them as the work of people we have elected to legislate for
us, and who do at least debate the acts in public.
In IGCs, by contrast, the work is done at best by ministers, more often by
officials, following the conventions of diplomatic negotiation, not
parliamentary debate. They meet behind closed doors. Yet the texts emanating
from these bodies are much more important than most acts of national
parliaments; indeed, they define ground rules within which national
parliaments are obliged to operate ever after, unless they take the extreme
step of withdrawing from the EC altogether.
These texts do, of course, require national ratification. But the fact that
national ratification of the latest one - the Maastricht treaty - is proving
so difficult shows that the limit of public tolerance has now been reached.
It is pure self-delusion to imagine that things would be better if only the
last IGC had accepted 'a hierarchy of norms'. From here on a different
approach is needed.
Mr Delors mentioned 'the next institutional reform, scheduled for January
1996'. Actually the Maastricht treaty (article N2) says nothing about
January. But it does say that 'a conference of representatives of the
governments of the member states shall be convened in 1996 to examine those
provisions of this treaty for which revision is provided'. In other words,
yet another IGC.
Revision of the Maastricht treaty will certainly be needed, in 1996 if not
before, because whole chunks of it will be unworkable even with 12 member
states, let alone the 16 the Community will probably have by 1996. What is
actually required is a constitution: that is, a rule book for the European
union - something all Europeans could understand, and to which they could
appeal when any of the union's governing bodies appeared to exceed its
lawful powers.
Many states, including most of the EC's member states, have such a document
to regulate their internal affairs. How did they get it? By electing a
special assembly, called a constituent assembly, to draft it for them, and
in most cases by ratifying the result in a referendum.
So that's what we need in 1996, not another IGC but a European constituent
assembly, empowered to revise the treaty and present the results to member
states for ratification. One way to get it would be to agree in advance that
the next European Parliament will have such powers - but that may not be
possible, because it would mean getting agreement before the next European
elections, which are little more than a year away.
Either way, we shall not get such an assembly without the agreement of
national governments, since only the member states could endow it with the
necessary powers. This means we shall not get it unless there is a
widespread and intensive public campaign for it throughout Europe, one so
big that national governments dare not ignore it. A crusade, if you insist.
National governments will fight hard and dirty to avoid this surrender of
power, equating - as always - their own power with national sovereignty, and
depicting the proposed assembly as a federalist monster. But the answer to
that is simple. The decisions of the assembly would not be binding on any
member state until it had ratified them. I suggest this should be done by
holding a national referendum in every member state on the same day; but if
some states insist on using a parliamentary procedure, so be it. The
important point is that democracy and transparency would have been part of
the process from the start, instead of being dragged in as a half-hearted
afterthought, which is what has happened with Maastricht.
There is no time to lose. The crusade should start now.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof RONALD DORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have just come across your leader of February 8 congratulating John
Smith, the opposition leader, for learning lessons from President Clinton
about being in tune with 'the aspirations of ordinary people'. And about
time, too. Hurrah] etc.
But the aspiration of most of us ordinary people is to be free riders if we
can get away with it. To have a first-rate health service and run it on
peanuts. To pay the non-ordinary unemployable homeless enough to keep them
from begging on the streets and turning our parks into shanty-towns, but not
out of our own pockets.
Democratic politics used to be thought to be about using persuasion to
change other people's aspirations so as to bring them more in line with (a)
one's own perception of reality and (b) one's own values.
Take current aspirations as given, as your leader does, and politics is
either about clever public relations deception, or about the spendthrift
piling-up of American or Italian-style fiscal deficits.
Is that the sort of democracy we really want?

FT  17 FEB 93 / Duo preaches rewards of rigour: South Africa has accepted
the need for economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took the ruling National party in South Africa more than 40 years to come
to its senses about apartheid, and it was the economic failure of the policy
 -not its moral repugnance - which finally tipped the balance.
Now, with the National party on the point of abandoning its hegemony and
entering government with the African National Congress, it is keen to put
behind it the peculiarly South African form of state socialism which
bolstered apartheid. It fears that the ANC might otherwise decide to ape
this policy, using the state to further African interests at the expense of
the Afrikaner.
So at the last moment, the National party has been converted to economic
discipline, to the kind of free-market policies without which post-apartheid
South Africa cannot flourish. Faced with an economy which can only employ
just over half of the available labour force, where productivity is low and
real wages high by international standards, and where the civil service is
large and inefficient, there is no alternative to economic reform.
That has been true for years, and it has not previously stopped Pretoria
from denying reality. But the country's finance minister, Mr Derek Keys,
finally seems to have removed the blinkers from both government and
opposition eyes. With a clever slide show demonstrating the depths of the
economic crisis, which he has presented to everyone from the cabinet to the
leaders of the ANC, Mr Keys has concentrated the minds of politicians on the
need for a rapid political settlement. More than anything else, this has
driven progress in the constitutional talks between the National party and
the ANC which last week yielded an outline agreement on power-sharing.
Mr Keys, with his commitment to tight fiscal policies, is a powerful ally
for Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, the country's central
bank. Mr Stals has fought for years to instil monetary discipline. Last
year, he managed to restrict money supply growth, as defined by the broad
measure of M3, to within a tight target of 7 to 10 per cent.
The finance minister, who took office last May after a successful career as
executive chairman at Gencor, the country's second-largest mining company,
says South Africa has now entered a 'sane economic era' which can lay the
basis for future growth. The credit for that must be shared between Mr Keys
and Mr Stals, whose uncompromising monetary policy has helped push inflation
to a 15-year low. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of just under 10
per cent in December (see chart.) There are also signs that inflationary
expectations are also beginning to fall. Fund managers, for example, are
expressing renewed interest in fixed-interest securities.
But Mr Keys' achievement in promoting economics to the centre of the
political debate should not be underestimated. Through force of intellect
and personality, he has frightened the politicians out of their previous
leisurely approach to negotiations, while maintaining good relations with
both sides.
More technocrat than politician (probably the main reason for his success),
Mr Keys has gained the respect of the ANC. But more important, he has won
over the president, Mr F W de Klerk, who alone can authorise the painful
economic restructuring now being planned.
Pretoria has yet to release details of the restructuring programme, but Mr
Keys has made clear that stimulating investment is the centrepiece. That can
only be achieved by reducing government consumption expenditure so as to
channel more of national income into private fixed investment, and by
restoring investors' confidence after years of political uncertainty and
high inflation.
Mr Keys has taken his reform message to every forum that will listen. He
mourns the fact that gross domestic fixed investment has fallen from 26 per
cent of national income in 1983 to 16 per cent now - only 1 per cent more
than is needed simply to replace worn-out and obsolete capacity. That, he
says, is the most important element restraining economic growth, which has
been negative for each of the past three years. A modest recovery, to real
growth of between 0.5 and 2 per cent, is expected this year.
Government expenditure is the obvious target to free more funds for
investment. Mr Keys points out that government consumption spending has
risen from about 10 per cent of national income in the 1960s to more than
double that now. Over the same period, Japanese government consumption
spending was held to 9 per cent of national income.
But politically, there could hardly be a worse time to restrain government
expenditure. Many blacks expect a multi-racial government to make up for the
deprivations of apartheid overnight. Scope for cuts is also limited,
although Mr de Klerk (under Mr Keys' influence) has said that civil servants
must take a large pay cut in real terms, of perhaps 3 to 5 per cent, in the
coming fiscal year. Taxes will also be increased, while civil service
personnel should be cut by 5 per cent by the end of March.
Nonetheless, the budget deficit, which is expected to end the financial year
at more than 8 per cent of gross domestic product, will probably remain high
at 6 or 7 per cent of GDP in fiscal 1993-94. Finance department officials
say that to cut the deficit to 5 per cent of GDP would require drastic
action, the equivalent of a 7 percentage point rise in value-added tax (now
10 per cent).
Despite the deficit, finance ministry officials point out that spending
targets were largely achieved this year. They say that the deficit resulted
from a revenue shortfall due to recession and severe drought, and they
predict spending will show only a very modest real increase next year.
Mr Stals says he believes 1993 will set the tone for the new South Africa.
If Mr Keys proves to have the courage of his convictions on curbing
government spending - and crucially, if the ANC and the trade unions resist
public protests against such measures - then the central bank governor
predicts this 'can easily become a decisive year in which the foundations
will be laid for future economic development'.
With the labour force shrinking by 2 per cent in 1991 and 3 per cent in the
first half of 1992 - adding to the 40 per cent of the economically active
population already without formal employment - something must be done to
revive growth.
But nobody believes anything can be done quickly. Indeed, many economic
commentators are sceptical that inflation will remain in single figures, as
the finance minister has promised, and that economic growth will resume.
But with Mr Keys at the Finance Ministry and Mr Stals at the central bank -
posts both could retain in an interim government - South Africa has the best
chance in years of breaking out of what Mr Keys calls 'the down-and-out
trap'. And unless economic success can be achieved, South African democracy
will rest on fragile foundations.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Letter: A much better idea than selling off the roads
network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From B W BARTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest your article, 'Road network sell-off proposed'
(February 12). My experience of the motorway network suggests that, on the
rare occasions when the traffic is actually flowing, so fragile is this
phenomenon that the tip vortices from a passing butterfly are sufficient to
produce a 10-mile tailback. One toll booth would bring the whole of the
country to a standstill. Has the refugee from the land of the cerebrally
challenged who thought up this one ever driven round the M25?
I have an idea of how the government could raise the Pounds 2bn it requires.
Charge an annual levy on every road user; Pounds 100 a year from 20m of them
should just about do it. The government could call it a road fund licence
and supply little round stickers to put in your windscreen as proof of
payment. If it wished to charge according to usage it could (revolutionary,
this one) impose a tax on fuel. About 6p a litre should raise the same
amount.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Arts: Entertaining Mr Sloane - Theatre revivals in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane, which will be 30 years old next
year, it is easy to feel that it is a modern classic. Since it has been
absent from the London stage for over 10 years, 10 years in which Orton's
legend has grown, this Greenwich revival is well timed. This is still the
blackest of black comedies. The themes of youthful criminality,
manipulation, bisexuality, misogyny and murder still prompt an audience to
appalled laughter at regular intervals. At Greenwich, however, no-one as yet
falls off his or her seat with laughter. Orton, even 29 years on, should be
funnier.
That the director has comic gifts is not in question. He is Jeremy Sams, who
is also one of our theatre's leading translators and musical arrangers. His
very successful directorial debut, with Schippel the Plumber, occurred less
than a year ago, in this same theatre. Very occasionally in that, and quite
often in the rhymes of his translations, he has liked to nudge along a
comedy with extra clevernesses of his own. In Entertaining Mr Sloane,
however, he resists that. In this respect he shows a new kind of maturity.
He also makes us feel something quite surprising: that Orton is not far from
Pinter - and that Entertaining Mr Sloane is the flip side of The Servant.
It could be that, within another week of performances, the laughter will
quadruple. (At present the violent scenes are so choreographed that you can
almost hear the counts.) That the comedy sometimes hangs fire as yet is
largely to do with Sams's handling of Mr Sloane himself and his landlady
Kath. Ben Daniels has the right kind of promising late-adolescent
musculature and body-language; the way he turns over on the settee as he
refers to Eddie doing 'a bit of servicing' says volumes. But he lacks
Sloane's hilariously alarming mystery. He even tries to make us understand
his thuggish, panicking, nervous system. Nice work, but wrong play.
Janet Dale, as Kath, is funny from the first minute - from the moment she
explains that the room should have the summer curtains, which 'are more of a
chintz.' And her beady-eyed, squashy, puglike face is a hoot - until you
notice how sometimes she pulls it into consciously 'funny' expressions. That
she does not possess the buxom figure her lines suggest need not be a
problem. But she seems not to imagine she is voluptuous; and she
characterises Kath so sharply as a slatternly lower-class dowd that she
misses her hypocritical pretensions to gentility and 'ideas of morality.'
(And 'My teeth, since you mentioned the subject, Mr Sloane, are in the
kitchen in Stergene' should raise a louder guffaw.)
Remembering the first-rate performances Dale has given with such directors
as Trevor Nunn (Nicholas Nickleby) and Nicholas Hytner (The Madness of
George III), I imagine that another director would have elicited a more
rounded and suggestive performance from her. But, as her brother Ed (whom
Orton himself felt should be 'the central pivot of the play'), Ian Gelder is
perfect. Early on, as he finds himself encouraging Sloane to wear leather
trousers without pants, he tries to laugh; the laugh becomes a choke, he
goes red in the face, and there in a jiffy he shows you the whole character
 -bent, horny, closeted and apoplectic.
There are one or two puzzles. Sams runs Acts 2 and 3 together. Though this
spoils Orton's suspense, it makes dramatic sense. But why make a momentary
blackout between them? And why stress Sloane's terror, rather than his
manipulation? Earlier on, preparing for her seduction of Sloane, Kath puts
on some easy-listening music; and only when Act 1 ends on their sex does the
record get stuck in a silent groove. But Orton's stage direction is funnier.
Kath has hardly put the music on than 'the needle jumps a groove, slides
across record. Automatic change switches record off.' God (said Blake) is in
the detail; and so is Orton.
At the Greenwich Theatre, until March 20

A populist night on the box tonight. Rowan Atkinson's character Mr Bean, a
cross between Chaplin and Mr Magoo, has proved tremendously successful and
there will be a vast audience for his latest misadventure, Mr Bean in Room
426, on ITV at 8pm tonight.
That is followed by The Brit Awards, the record industry's annual prize
giving. Much has been made of the fact that many of the nominees, especially
Elton, Eric and Phil, are pushing 50, and hardly represent the future, while
others, like Kate Bush, have not made a new record in years. However, the
ceremony serves to draw attention to British pop music, which is currently
going through a bad patch and needs all the publicity it can get.
A much more competitive musical event goes out at 7.20pm on BBC 2, the final
of The Choir of the Year competition. The keen rivalry of the participants
is only matched by the sporting behaviour of the six choirs singing it out
for the two titles. Perhaps the fact that there is no money involved ensures
the wonderful atmosphere.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Arts: 'Alfie' - bold, brash, dated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What a terrible lot we must have been in the 1960s: bold, brash, relatively
affluent and up to the ears in sex. The late Bill Naughton's Alfie, set in
London 1963, now looks like a period piece from an age when men referred to
women as birds, the women did not object, and southern audiences were
delighted by such northern frankness. The play is not as funny, nor as
outrageous, as it used to be, but it still has tricks up the sleeve.
Alfie is an out-and-out womaniser, full of male vanity. Yet he is not wholly
an exploiter. Most of the women are at least as eager as he is. A few of
them, like Ruby - the owner of a small chain of hairdressers and a fur coat
to boot - come out on top. Occasionally he even feels remorse; the
suggestion is that he is at heart a sentimental fellow who just cannot keep
his eyes off skirts, or indeed off Alfie. He is remarkably well-groomed and
dressed: women want to cook for him, press his clothes, iron his shirts and
even wash his floor.
In 1993 the obvious question is whether Britain really was like that 30
years ago. How does he find the money to buy his smart blazers and sports
jackets, let alone own a car, when he appears to have no fixed job? At most,
he is a part-time hired driver. He spends one act of the play in hospital
under what must have been an excellent national health service: the nurses
go to bed with him.
The questions are not answered: perhaps in those far-off days no-one thought
of raising them. Even the funds for an abortion are found quite easily:
Pounds 30 at 1963 prices, bargainable down to Pounds 21. This must be one of
the last British plays to pretend that social and economic problems did not
exist. It was acclaimed as a breath of fresh air: with hindsight it looks
like pure fantasy.
Alfie, originally played by the classical actor John Neville, is now taken
over by Adam Faith, a survivor not so much from the 1960s as the 1950s.
Faith looks as young as ever, as though nothing has changed. He also has
great charm and there is the odd good twist in the text. Some very strong
supporting performances include notably Sara Richardson who triples as the
doctor and two of Alfie's girl-friends. Faith directs himself; whether he
realises that this ought to be a museum piece is open to doubt.

'Would you trust the dancing?' This was the question George Balanchine asked
a TV director when discussions were under way about recording some of his
ballets. Balanchine was concerned with preserving his choreography's
identity for television, and 'trusting the dancing' is a central problem for
anyone who transfers stage work to the screen. The cases are all too
numerous of choreographer's intentions traduced by oh-so-clever camera work.
A variety of dance programmes on television during recent months - some
recordings; some work specially conceived for the medium - have shown that
TV often does not trust dance. (That it perpetuates a great deal of mediocre
choreography and feeble performance is another, equally serious, matter.)
Two fine directors of TV dance - Derek Bailey, Colin Nears - invariably
provide scrupulous accounts of the choreography with which they are
entrusted. Bailey's skill was very welcome in his recording of MacMillan's
Winter Dreams on BBC2 at Christmas. Faced with a stage text which was a web
of incident linking actuality and memory, he collaborated with MacMillan,
and succeeded in preserving the poignant moods we knew from stage
performance well and good.
But to 'trust the dancing' is also to respect it in the context of history
and of society, and the American series Dancing, which is currently clogging
BBC 2 on Sunday evenings, is a horrid example of how not to present and
explain dance on television. Dancing has such obvious and worthy intentions
 -its message, oh dear, concerns 'the importance of dance in world culture'
 -that adverse comment seems like mocking the afflicted. Afflicted the
series sadly is: by uncertain vision, by tedious disquisitions from
chattering heads, by historical inadequacy, and by a strand of what I take
to be 'political correctness', so that the duller and more inconsiderable
its social and ethnic concerns, the more unquestioning its acceptance of the
material. (It is possible to know too much about shimmying posteriors in the
Cook Islands, and about West African ritual.) Even to my willing gaze, the
programmes are prodigiously earnest; to the less-than-dedicated, they must
seem a festival of tedium.
There have been visually exciting and informative sequences. The Japanese
material was strong: impossible not to enjoy the hieratic splendour of the
Gagaku ceremony, or the great Kabuki performers Tamasaburo and Ennosuke.
Their art responds to the camera - the close study of Tamasaburo's onnagata
playing, femininity concentrated to its most potent essence, was magnificent
 -and they spoke revealingly about their craft. Fascinating, too, a section
in the first programme about young Indian men in Birmingham who have revived
bhangra dance, and have discovered in it cultural roots and the means of
joyous wedding celebration. But we must set against these the footage - the
mileage - about Brazilian and African dance, infinitely worthy, and flatter
than Holland. How can movement so vivid in life, and so responsive to life,
be made so dreary in the cause of information?
With a certain naivete the programme-makers decided to define 'dancing' on
their own arbitrary and sometimes questionable terms. Military ceremonial
was 'choreography', as was a religious procession. Historical antecedents
were sketchily evoked: comment about the court ballet of the 17th century
was less than serious; discussion about the Christian religious dance
tradition would have been better excised, so feeble was it. Faced with a
subject vastly too large even for an eight-part series - and for what must
have been a massive budget - the makers opted for something between the
Readers' Digest and a bluffers' guide to ethnology.
Dancing fails because it has no single controlling idea of what is meant by
its title, no central and inspiring spokesman. The golden example of an
extended arts series is Kenneth Clark's Civilisation. It remains a memorably
valuable display of popular education because of Lord Clark himself. He
persuaded us of the passion he felt for art in many forms, and his
scholarship, so lightly worn, was a delight shared with his viewers.
Enthusiasm is contagious on the small screen. Today, obsessive gardeners,
manic cooks, are the Ancient Mariners of the box, holding us with a
glittering eye.
There have been moments in dancing when a voice, clear and authoritative,
has won through: I thought Sheila Walker, an anthropologist from Texas,
spoke with exemplary directness about American/African culture. But for the
most part the commentary, read by Miranda Richardson, is a laundry-list of
pieties. Scripts are carefully crafted from safe remarks - there seems
neither desire nor time to be anything other than bland - interspersed with
babble from 'authorities'. Too often their views have rung with special
pleading; on occasion they have been inexact enough to make an aficionado
wince.
The programmes have lacked style as well as intellectual rigour. There have
been too many of those generalisations which, by their need to inform on
basic terms, tie history in granny-knots. (Relics of my former mess-deck
vocabulary surfaced when we were told that Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty is
16. Petipa, whose creation she was, gave her age as 20). In a programme
which offered an uneasy juxtaposition between classical ballet and Kabuki
drama, the statement that ballet had 'retained an essential character for
300 years' set the jaw agape. One could equally question beliefs that were
voiced on the value of a young dancer in the role of Aurora because 'it
helps the character'. It takes a ballerina much of her career to learn how
to dance the part. The linking of Petersburg classicism with Kabuki seemed
gratuitous, and exasperatingly clever in the closing sequence which zipped
with fine insensitivity between Beauty and Tokyo while the band played
Tchaikovsky-ishly on.
As the weeks have gone by, the series has taken on the air of being
assembled in committee by anthropologists and sociologists. Editorial
choices have looked odd, at times wilful, and fatally quaint. There is
little point in showing newly-fashioned Baroque dances - they lack
historical credibility - or in stressing the work of Katherine Dunham,
interesting as it was in its time, while ignoring much of Spanish dance, and
whisking through twentieth century ballet as if on the big dipper.
The programme on American modern dance matched good spoken sense - Twyla
Tharp, haranguing the camera, had vigorous opinions that should have made
viewers realise that dancing is a lively art - with revealing film. But this
was a rarity. On March 7, the final programme, introduced by the opera
director Peter Sellars - hair by Stan Laurel - will be devoted to the 1990
Pacific Rim festival of 'Dancing in one World'. I find it the apotheosis of
everything that is well-intentioned, woolly-minded and depressing about this
series, as cohorts of dancers hop, skip and jump in the cause of ethnic
bonhomie.
That television can excite the viewer by exploring the communicative power
of dancing was seen in a brave programme last summer. In The Far End of the
Garden for BBC 2, Ross McGibbon, a Royal Ballet dancer turned director,
looked at the choreographer Jonathan Burrows. McGibbon provided a sharp-eyed
portrait of Burrows and his awkward, heart-tearing movement. He trusted the
dance, and we understood its nature. Dancing, alas, has merely clouded the
issue.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Arts: A second Stiffelio - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC relay of Verdi's Stiffelio from Covent Garden a couple of weeks ago
will hopefully have won new friends for this important, neglected opera. On
television the production's wide-screen views of life in the Protestant
communities of Montana looked marvellous and the opera's concentration on
the intimate issue of marital fidelity will have been brought home with
extra force.
In the theatre, the Royal Opera has shown that it works just as well. The
censorship that was forced upon the opera in the 19th century - the plot
concerns a Protestant minister and his adulterous wife, which would have
been contentious enough, if the story did not also reach its climax at a
church service depicted on stage - meant that Stiffelio was soon forgotten.
There is no tradition of performance. Few singers have it in their
repertoire today.
For that reason it is worth noting that the Royal Opera fielded a second
tenor in the all-important title-role on Monday. Following Jose Carreras as
Stiffelio came Giorgio Lamberti for the last two performances of the run.
Looking suitably grave, a man of the church respected and even revered, he
caught well the studied outward control that is an integral part of
Stiffelio the man.
As the evening continued, however, it started to look as though this was as
much a sign of his own nervousness as an intended feature of the character.
It is always difficult to step into a role when everybody else in the cast
is well rehearsed; doubly so, no doubt, when the opera is a rare one. But
Lamberti sounded unsure of himself, husbanding his resources, lifting the
voice up to notes, gingerly approaching climaxes which were asking for
unfettered passion.
Fortunately the power of the opera was only marginally diminished. The other
singers, notably Catherine Malfitano in full, confident voice as the wife,
had their roles well within their grasp. In the pit Edward Downes built up
formidable dramatic tension, even if early Verdi ideally asks to burn on a
shorter fuse. I note that Placido Domingo is due to take on Stiffelio in New
York. The Royal Opera should consider a revival of this production for him,
if it has not already done so.
Final performance February 18 (Box Office 071-240 1066)

FT  17 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Monkeying about with medicine
/ A look at a project to export macaques from Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Off the south-west coast of tropical Java lies the 1,000-hectare Deli
island. Indonesia has more than 13,000 islands but Deli is unique because of
its indigenous population - 10,000 Macaca fascicularis monkeys.
The island is under a 25-year lease to CV Primates (Indonesia), an exporter
of monkeys for use in medical research. The first shipment of 100 animals
was made last December to the US. Primates aims to export a further 500 this
year to the US, Japan and Europe.
By 1995, exports from Deli could total 3,000 monkeys or 15 per cent of
current world demand for Macaca fascicularis, which account for at least 85
per cent of laboratory monkeys.
Paul Houghton, foreign partner of Primates, says the Deli island project
should appease environmentalists. As the island comes on stream, the company
will run down its trade in wild monkeys, which have historically provided
the bulk of laboratory animals.
And Primates will consider breeding a different species of macaque, Macaca
nemistrina, if tests confirm it as a suitable model for Aids research.
This would reduce the use of chimpanzees, an endangered species but
currently judged the only suitable model for Aids research.
The monkey population on Deli is free-ranging and Houghton accepts that,
other than supplementary feeding and veterinary care, there is little
difference between a wild monkey and a Deli monkey.
'It's a grey area. Somehow this business is always in the shade,' he says.
But he hopes Deli island will make the business more respectable and,
potentially, more profitable.
With the island as a captive breeding centre, Primates will screen the
monkeys for diseases - and disease resistance - which would make them
unsuitable for medical programmes.
An unscreened monkey fetches between Dollars 200-Dollars 300, while a
screened animal can fetch six times that price.
Perhaps unintentionally, therefore, the campaign against trapping wild
animals has created an opening for Primates - value-added monkeys. 'Within
this decade the average price of these animals will be Dollars 2,000,'
estimates Houghton.
Animal sympathisers might take heart in knowing that captive-bred, screened,
monkeys should reduce the overall number required by laboratories for
research. Deli island may also be used to replenish the wild population in
areas where hunting and destruction of habitat have taken their toll.
Houghton dismisses talk that using monkeys in laboratories is immoral and
insists vaccine-research into diseases such as Aids, hepatitis, malaria,
dengue and arterial sclerosis requires their use. He hopes the Deli island
project will be a first step to attracting more medical research to
Indonesia.
He also believes the project is essential if a wedge is to be driven into an
emerging monkey trade cartel.
Four companies, excluding Primates, currently dominate the trade in monkeys:
Siconbrec and AT Viri of the Philippines, Bioculture of Mauritius and CV
Primaco of Indonesia.
Of these, Siconbrec, Bioculture and Primaco have an exclusive contract with
Bausch and Lomb of the US which, in addition to manufacturing Ray-Ban
sunglasses and alcohol-free mouthwash, also controls up to 70 per cent of
the world monkey trade, says Houghton. Within the European Community,
Houghton estimates Bausch and Lomb hold a 90 per cent market share.
Primates hopes to break this stranglehold but is currently restricted by an
EC ban on the import of monkeys from Indonesia on the grounds of alleged
violations of the international treaty on trade in endangered species.
Houghton believes some members of the EC regulatory body are simply against
research and stresses the damage that restricting monkey imports could do to
the European pharmaceutical industry.
'Those who control the monkeys control the drugs which come out on the
markets,' he explains.

FT  17 FEB 93 / People: Lloyd brothers divide and rule
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Chemists, Britain's second largest chemists' chain after Boots, has
split the role of chairman and chief executive.
Allen Lloyd (above left) will remain executive chairman of the highly
acquisitive group while his younger brother, Peter Lloyd (above right), who
is currently director of retail operations, takes over as chief executive.
Separately Sir Eric Pountain, non-executive chairman of Tarmac, the
construction group, IMI and James Beattie, was named as Lloyds' third
non-executive director.
The boardroom changes, which had been foreshadowed in recent comments made
by Allen Lloyd, mean that the structure of the board now follows the Cadbury
recommendations.
Institutional investors are understood to have commented on the desirability
of strengthening the board and splitting the chairman and chief executive's
roles in the wake of Lloyds Chemists' recent rapid growth.
Last March Lloyds overtook its rival Macarthy.
Commenting on the changes, Allen Lloyd said: 'After 20 years building the
business, I believe now is the appropriate time to strengthen the board and
split the roles of chairman and chief executive.'
Peter Lloyd joined the group in 1978 as financial controller and was
appointed to the board in 1979. For the past two years he has assumed much
of the work of chief executive, leaving his brother to concentrate on broad
strategic issues.
Sir Eric will join Lloyds Chemists' two existing non-executive directors,
Tim Brooks and Paul Byrne, on the board and will also be a member of the
audit and remuneration committees.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Both sides claim victory in
'who should pay' case - A long-running dispute over insurance coverage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurers, including underwriters at the Lloyd's market in London, have
welcomed the judgment by a California appeals court in the Shell Rocky
Mountain Arsenal case, one of the biggest disputes about insurance coverage
for environmental pollution in the US. Insurers' confidence over the
judgment, though, could be at best premature and at worst entirely
misplaced.
At the centre of the Rocky Mountain Arsenal case is a 27-square mile site
near Denver, Colorado. Its owners, the US Army, made chemical weapons there
 -including nerve and mustard gas - from 1942 until 1969, leasing part of
the site to Shell Oil, the US subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, which made a
range of pesticides and herbicides there - and deposited waste products -
between 1952 and 1969.
Current estimates of the total clean-up costs range between Dollars
1bn-Dollars 2bn. Shell has agreed with the army to pay 50 per cent of the
first Dollars 500m in costs, 35 per cent of the next Dollars 200m and 20 per
cent of any remaining cost.
Impartial observers believe that verdict, handed down on 21 January by Judge
Ming Chen, encourages both sides. 'There is enough in this for both sides to
claim victory,' suggests Chris Clarke, environmental specialist with the
fortnightly newsletter, World Insurance Report.
And while Shell and its lawyers are understandably cautious, policyholder
lawyers have been heartened by the verdict. Randolph Fields, a lawyer who
acts on behalf of policyholders in similar cases, says the result is a 'a
terrible defeat for Lloyd's'.
Last month's legal ruling is the latest stage in litigation about who should
pay. Shell originally notified potential claims on several hundred
comprehensive general liability insurance policies from February 1982,
resorting to legal action when its insurers refused to pay.
In the judgment, the California court ruled Shell could not collect on
policies which it had bought after 1969, when insurers introduced a clause
which limited coverage to pollution caused by a 'sudden and accidental'
release of pollutant.
That part of the verdict produced a triumphant response from insurance
lawyers, who say it means Shell is unable to claim on approximately
two-thirds of the policies potentially triggered by the claim.
'In terms of financial impact it's very significant for London. We got more
out of it than the policyholder,' says Barry Bunshoft, a San Francisco-based
attorney with Hancock Robert and Bunshoft, which represented Lloyd's
underwriters in the case.
However, Shell and its lawyers are placing equal emphasis on a second part
of the judgment.
When the case was first in court in 1988 the jury found that Shell could not
collect on insurance policies because the pollution it had caused at Rocky
Mountain had been 'expected and intended' and therefore was not covered by
the wordings on policies bought by Shell between 1952 and 1969.
Last month the appeals court ruled that in 1988 the jury had been improperly
instructed to determine whether Shell knew or should have known that it was
contaminating the site.
Instead, the court ruled jurors should have been asked to determine only
whether Shell actually expected or intended the pollution. That part of the
case will now be heard again by a lower court, opening up the possibility
that Shell can claim on its older policies.
Bunshoft, the Lloyd's lawyer, said the judge's view on this issue amounted
to 'nit-picking'.
Shell, though, insists that insurers could still be liable for a significant
portion of the clean-up cost. At the very least the legal battle seems set
to continue for some time. Clarke says: 'The reality is that more stages of
judicial argument lie ahead before final resolution of this enormous case.'

FT  17 FEB 93 / People: Bowater - Woodhouse takes over
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bowater's acquisition of Specialty Coatings International has prompted
chairman Norman Ireland to bring forward the announcement of his retirement
after six years in the job. He will be succeeded by Michael Woodhouse, a
director since 1989 and former deputy chairman of Courtaulds.
Ireland had planned to announce the step with the company's preliminary
results in March, having completed two three-year terms, but will now make
way for the new chairman at the annual meeting in May. He remains a director
of BTR, the industrial holding group of which he was formerly finance
director.
Woodhouse, 65, and David Lyon, Bowater's chief executive, go back a long
way. Woodhouse was Lyon's first boss when he was at Courtaulds between 1959
and 1970 and taught him much about industry. Lyon then went on via Rank
Organisation and Redland to become the well-regarded chief executive of
Bowater.
Woodhouse, educated at Lancing College and Queen's College Oxford, is an
industrialist, unlike Ireland who is a finance man, and has spent his whole
career at Courtaulds. He started there in 1951, rose to become a director in
1976 and was deputy chairman from 1986 until his retirement in 1991. He has
been a non-executive director of Bowater since 1988 and is also on the
Prince's Trust for Volunteers.
*****
Michael Steyaert, a 51-year-old Belgian, has been appointed managing
director of GEC Avery, the weighing equipment subsidiary of the General
Electric Company. He succeeds David Scahill, who has become md of GEC
Meters.
Steyaert has many years of experience managing GEC companies in mainland
Europe. He will be responsible for combining the operations of Avery and
Maatshappij van Berkel's Patent (Berkel) into the world's second largest
integrated weighing and food processing equipment company. GEC bought a
majority stake in the struggling Dutch company in 1990 and is now acquiring
the remaining shares. Steyaert will remain Berkel's president.

FT  17 FEB 93 / People: Fry moves up as Burmah Castrol splits role
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jonathan Fry (right), managing director of Burmah Castrol and chief
executive of Castrol, will succeed Lawrence Urquhart as Burmah Castrol's
chief executive on June 1. Urquhart, 57, will continue as chairman of the
lubricants, chemicals and fuels group, on a non-executive basis.
Tim Stevenson, 44, currently chief executive of Burmah Castrol Fuels group,
will join the main board in March and take over from Fry, 55, as chief
executive of Castrol in August.
Analysts say Fry's step-up had been expected, as he had recently been taking
an increasingly high-profile role. He joined the group in 1978 as planning
director and won his spurs as chief executive of the chemicals group by
integrating acquisitions.
He has been chief executive of Castrol since 1987, a period which has seen
the lubricants business build on its strong brand identity.
Splitting the role of chairman and chief executive does accord with
recommended practice in the City, but Burmah Castrol says this development
had been under consideration since the group was reorganised in 1990 -
before the Cadbury report was published.
Stevenson, described as 'one of the group's best strategic thinkers', has
been chief executive of Burmah Castrol Fuels since 1990, having previously
been chief executive of Burmah Castrol Chemicals' sealants division.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Archaeology in the pipeline -
The discovery of an Iron Age man
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The body was found in a curled position, as if the Iron Age man had been
seeking protection from the harsh Humberside winds. Scattered around him
were the flint tools he had used more than 2,000 years ago and fragments of
pottery which once held offerings left by grieving relatives.
The skeleton might have remained undisturbed for another 2,000 years, had
not Kelt Energy, the UK-quoted independent, set upon the Humberside wolds
for its latest onshore gas venture. The Caythorpe field, which produces the
first onshore gas to be sold to an independent marketing company, was opened
by Kelt and its partner, DSM Energy, last month.
The opening was accompanied by an exhibition of artefacts - ranging from a
brightly enamelled Roman brooch to a crude 4,000-year-old flint saw -
discovered in an eight-week excavation sponsored by Kelt.
The archaeological dig was less the result of Kelt's philanthropic
tendencies, than a preventive measure to ensure the smooth passage of
planning permission for its 4.5m pipeline. Following Department of the
Environment guidelines issued in 1990, planning committees are increasingly
likely to consider heritage concerns to be as important as other
environmental issues. This has placed new strains on many companies such as
Kelt.
The Caythorpe region is a minefield for any developer. 'This area has one of
the densest concentrations of archaeological sites in the country,' says
Peter Cardwell, a partner of Northern Archaeological Associates.
However, Kelt sought to pre-empt planning objections by hiring the
archaeological consultancy at an early stage of Caythorpe's development. The
pipeline's route was determined only after aerial photographs and in-depth
research had pinpointed the main archaeological sites to avoid. The route
was then subjected to magnetic soundings. More sites were discovered, and
Kelt duly altered the initial pipeline path.
The company then decided to fund the excavation of sites which it could not
avoid. The guidelines are vague as to who has to foot the bill; however, the
local council can force a developer to find financing for both the
excavation and subsequent analysis of the finds. Kelt took the view that it
would be quicker - and, in the end, cheaper - to fund the research itself.
'The excavation added about Pounds 50,000 to our costs,' says Paddy Spinks,
a director, somewhat ruefully. Post-excavation research brings the total
spent to Pounds 120,000, about 2 per cent of the total production budget for
Caythorpe. But for that price, the company had roughly halved the time it
might have taken to gain planning permission and won the council's support.
'Our relationship with Kelt has been very good,' says John Crook, senior
planning officer with Humberside County Council. 'The work they did before
submitting the planning application did help to ensure a relatively smooth
passage.'
For the region's archaeologists, development was offset by the enticement of
funding. 'It was almost certainly the largest excavation in the area in the
past year,' says Cardwell. Sites were discovered which would otherwise have
gone unnoticed or unfunded.
A study prepared for the official opening of Caythorpe cites the most
important findings: a previously unidentified Roman settlement, dating from
between 100 AD and 410 AD; the fact that this particular site was
continuously occupied through the Anglo-Saxon period, to about 600 AD, set
academic hearts aflutter. Until that discovery, there had been no evidence
of such continuous occupation in the region.
Kelt may have had to sacrifice time and money to get Caythorpe going.
However, the unexpectedly good finds, combined with the site's encouraging
output - at the top end of forecasts for between 5m and 10m cubic feet a day
 -is already making such concerns less material.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Management: A time and motion study for the House - Can
parliament be more efficient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Reform in this House proceeds exceeding slow. It makes a snail look like
Nigel Mansell.'
Sir Peter Emery, Conservative MP and Commons procedure committee chairman.
Management consultants have infiltrated the gates of Whitehall, as
government reform of civil service working practices bears witness. But the
barbarians have yet to penetrate the Palace of Westminster. MPs jealously
continue to guard the right to decide how business in the engine room of
Britain's democracy is conducted. The result is that little ever changes.
But what might such a team of unelected executive mercenaries come up with
if unleashed on the green leather benches of the House of Commons debating
chamber? How would they suggest that business might be ordered more
efficiently? Here is an idea of what Messrs Rag, Tag and Bobtail might
propose.
First the good news: the Commons scores full marks for effort.
While ritualistic trappings give proceedings a leisurely and anachronistic
air, the chamber sits for longer than any comparable legislature. MPs work
on average a punishing 62-hour week - though increasingly outside the
debating chamber. Even critics of current practice, such as John Garrett -
Labour MP for Norwich South and, incidentally, a management consultant -
admit parliament 'processes thousands of pages of legislation, produces
hundreds of reports and airs countless grievances at remarkably little
cost'.*
But when it comes to organising this time there is room for improvement:
Hours. The Commons needs a comprehensive time-management study. Delaying the
start of sittings four days a week until 2.30pm was fine before 1911 when
MPs were unpaid and of necessity part time. But it means the Commons
frequently rises well after midnight. With most MPs on the go from 9am or
earlier, such a schedule is an inducement to work absurdly long hours and
scarcely conducive to effective debate.
On Fridays, when MPs are keen to return early to their constituencies,
business starts at 9.30am. So there seems little reason why the current
timetable should not simply be brought forward five hours from Tuesday to
Thursday.
No fewer than 83 per cent of MPs responding to a questionnaire prepared by a
cross-party committee examining possible reforms in 1991 favoured reducing
the number of late sittings.
When it reported last year, the committee's recommendations advocated merely
one extra morning sitting per week, along with some Fridays off and greater
efforts to wind up at 10pm.
Committee stage of bills. The development process in the Commons for
Westminster's core product line - legislation - could do with an overhaul.
Currently, effective scrutiny of a bill is too often subordinate to party
political skirmishing. This means the care with which a bill's contents are
examined and amendments considered, frequently bears little relation to the
measure's intrinsic qualities.
One way of correcting this imbalance and ensuring all clauses of a bill
receive equal scrutiny would be to provide for automatic time-tabling from
the outset of the committee stage of detailed consideration.
This innovation would also save time in the chamber by making debates on
time-tabling motions to limit debate redundant.
Summer recess. The Commons' holiday arrangements should correspond better
with the need to subject the government to year-round scrutiny.
As Labour's Harry Barnes and Jeff Rooker have argued, parliament's
three-month summer recess deprives MPs of the ability to tackle ministers
with written and verbal questions to which they must publicly respond. It
also strips MPs of the protection against libel which the parliamentary
privilege applied to everything uttered in the chamber provides.
The system championed by Joan Walley, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent North,
providing for a five-week cycle of four weeks at Westminster and one week
away, would be a sensible improvement.
Votes. There can be few spheres in which Bulgaria has anything to teach
Britain on productivity. But voting in the national parliament is one of
them. The wizardry of their electronic voting system means Bulgarian MPs can
conduct a vote in a twinkling of an eye compared with their British
counterparts, conserving valuable parliamentary time for other matters. For
example, the two cliff-hanging votes in November which secured Maastricht's
return to the Commons took a total of 31 minutes.
Installing an electronic voting system would represent a big step forward in
updating British parliamentary practice. But there is little chance of the
government agreeing to it. As the Maastricht debacle demonstrated, there is
nothing like having MPs queueing up to troop through the lobbies to make the
government whips' task of dissuading backbench rebels that much easier.
Prime Minister's Questions. Since MPs have only about 30 minutes per week in
which to question publicly the prime minister, it is bizarre to waste vital
seconds in pro forma inquiries about his engagements. This happens because
verbal questions must be submitted some two weeks ahead of time. It is
difficult then for the questioner to frame a topical question; so most fall
back on the formula, revealing their real interest only in follow-up
questions. The required innovation - abolishing the notice-period - is
self-evident.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Management: Keeping in Czech - Fund manager Viktor Kozeny
aims to exert control over his portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dispersion of shares among thousands of very small investors has been
highlighted by critics of eastern Europe's mass privatisation programme
(MPP). They say this approach militates against the emergence of powerful
new owners with enough clout to impose their will on management.
Viktor Kozeny, an American-educated Czech financial whiz-kid whose Harvard
Capital and Consulting company (HC and C) is widely credited with breathing
unexpected life into the Czechoslovak MPP last year, is out to prove them
wrong.
After five rounds of competitive bidding spread over almost a year, nearly
50 per cent of the coupons representing shares in around 1,500 newly
privatised Czech and Slovak companies are held by a small group of nine
investment funds. They intend to use their concentrated power to exert
effective control over the companies in their portfolios.
The unexpected concentration of shares in only nine out of the 400 funds
which blossomed last year follows Kozeny's success in persuading millions of
sceptical and inexperienced Czechs and Slovaks to take up the government's
voucher offer. He did this by promising to buy the Kcs 1,000 (Pounds 24)
privatisation vouchers for Kcs 10,000 12 months after the government
converts them into shares in the newly privatised companies. This is now
expected to happen early in 1994.
The offer turned what many potential investors had originally perceived as a
dubious bargain into an apparent sure-fire money spinner. Interest in the
coupons soared, and eventually 8.5m Czechs and Slovaks took advantage of the
government offer and subscribed the equivalent of an average week's wages
for their coupon books. Only 28 per cent of the vouchers were retained by
individuals. The bulk were entrusted for management to the 400 or so funds,
with Kozeny's and eight others run by banks and insurance companies taking
the lion's share.
The majority of coupon holders had only the vaguest notions about the
potential value, or even the identity, of the state-owned enterprises whose
shares they were invited to bid their coupons for during the first wave of
the MPP. Kozeny's HC and C, the first fund which offered to manage the
coupons on behalf of their new owners, is one of the biggest.
Unlike most of his imitators among the new funds, who scattered their
delegated coupons among the enterprises on offer, Kozeny limited his
purchases to 50 companies which his research identified as the 'vertebral
column' of the Czech and Slovak economies.
With the political divorce in view, MC and C created two Slovak funds,
denominated in Slovak crowns, and six Czech funds which hold 85 per cent of
the assets under management. Most Slovaks opted to invest the bulk of their
coupons in Czech enterprises, but they will not be able to participate in
the second wave of Czech coupon privatisation.
The laser-beam approach to portfolio-building has left the funds managed by
HC and C with stakes in key Czech and Slovak enterprises which are
sufficiently large to give the fund managers, Kozeny in particular,
effective proprietorial rights in strategic sectors of the economy.
The list includes two of the leading banks, Komercni Bank where the fund's
17.5 per cent holding translates into 40 per cent control over an
institution with assets of around Dollars 10bn (Pounds 7bn), and 13 per cent
of voting shares, again equivalent to 40 per cent control, in Ceska
Spositana, the savings bank.
Other key holdings built up by Kozeny's funds include strategic stakes in
CEZ, the main Czech hydro-electric company, Slovnaft, the Bratislava
refinery, and minority stakes in companies such as Tabak, now controlled by
Philip Morris, and Cokoladny, controlled by Nestle.
The latter offers both income growth and a sop to national feeling by
ensuring Czech investors retain a stake in what many see as 'family silver'
companies. More to the point, given Kozeny's pledge to redeem the coupons
entrusted to the fund at 10 times their nominal value, shares in companies
with large foreign shareholders are perceived as more liquid and more easily
marketable than the bulk of new shares whose market value will only be
definable once they are exchanged for coupons and become tradeable.
With an eye on the most successful Czech export sectors, Kozeny's funds have
also acquired significant stakes in breweries, paper and pulp companies, a
dozen brick and cement companies and four out of the five biggest
construction companies. 'One of the brick companies in southern Bohemia is
selling bricks costing 80 pfennigs for DM5.80 (Pounds 2.52) apiece in
Munich,' he says, underlining the profit potential for low-cost Czech
companies able to benefit from the Bonn-financed reconstruction of former
east Germany and the high-wage west German economy.
By contrast, Kozeny adds: 'We have not invested a single coupon in the iron
and steel industry or engineering.' These sectors, he adds, are saddled with
over-capacity, low productivity and high environmental liabilities.
Kozeny's selective approach has given HC and C funds 15-20 per cent stakes
and one or two board seats in 37 companies, and 7-8 per cent stakes in 13
others. This gives the funds run by Kozeny, who founded HC and C with
Dollars 3,000 and retains 100 per cent ownership, a management voice in
assets with a book value of around Dollars 1bn or an estimated Dollars 1.5bn
at current prices.
Making these newly acquired assets profitable, though, will require some
drastic surgery. If Kozeny has his way 'up to 60,000 or 70,000 people in the
enterprises we now help manage, roughly 25 per cent of the present work
force will have to go'. That includes the banks which are in the midst of a
heavy investment programme in new computers and equipment.
The ability of Young Turks such as Kozeny to influence enterprise management
depends on the willingness of millions of inexperienced small investors to
resist the temptation to liquidate their shares at the earliest opportunity.
If investors take the long view, the new funds, or at least the handful
which have built up strategic stakes, should retain the concentration of
ownership required to exercise ownership rights. If not, some of the funds
could be swept away by liquidity pressures. These are nervous times for
those involved in the boldest mass privatisation programme to date in the
former communist bloc.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Jobs: The real lessons of 'Yes, Minister' - Denmark's
premier is not the only Scandinavian to take Machiavellian manoeuvres
seriously
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'YOU wouldn't expect a managerial revolution to start in Scandinavia, but
this could be it,' the Jobs column remarked to its partner Bill Hall. He
just went on tapping his keyboard and peering at his screen. But I wasn't to
be deterred.
'You've surely seen the story about Denmark's new premier training his
cabinet by making them read Yes, Minister scripts?' I persisted . . . and
seemingly got through. 'Printed it two weeks back,' said Bill, best known
for his Observer column on the FT's centre pages, then he added with
scarcely a pause:
'What I want to know is why your announcement says your chief executive left
amicably when the buzz is he's taken the cash reserves with him, not to
mention the chairman's wife' - or some such words, which took me aback until
I saw what had happened. In the brief interval, he had put on his telephone
headset and begun talking over his tapping to someone else afar off.
His feat at first reminded me of the northern machinist's retort when
work-study experts ordered him to operate with both hands at once: 'Aye, and
if you stick yon broom-handle up my backside, I'll sweep t'floor as well.'
My second thought was to give up the struggle of internal communications and
beg the ears of you readers instead. After all, it's external communications
that are the nub of the managerial revolution which Scandinavian
developments might spark.
While it is admittedly hard to credit that a Dane would take lessons from a
Swede, such would appear to have occurred. For the Danish Social Democrat
premier Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is not the first Nordic eminence to twig that
the Yes, Minister television series - whose manipulations of elected leaders
by cunning bureaucrats are usually just laughed at as satirical comedy - is
underpinned by something serious indeed.
The same fact was seen beforehand by Sweden's Nils Brunsson, professor of
management at the Stockholm School of Economics. What awakened him to the
point, though, was not just watching the telly, but the findings of rigorous
research.
Accordingly, while he would agree that top bosses can learn much from Yes,
Minister scripts, he'd go farther. In his view, the dangers of being
manipulated from below are such that it takes exceptional humility as well
as intelligence on the bosses' part to pick out the right lessons, even
though they are noted in his book The Organisation of Hypocrisy*, discussed
in this corner of the FT in September 1991.
For the benefit of readers not around then, however, I'd better repeat that
he thinks the said dangers are rooted in the growing need for the heads of
companies, let alone countries, to pay heed to external communications. And
oddly enough, an illustration arose the other day when partner Hall kindly
invited me to a post-toil hobnob with colleagues who cover stock market
events.
During the chat, up came the Queens Moat company which, several of us
agreed, is certainly no less good than the rival group Forte when it comes
to managing hotels. So why, someone asked, have Queens Moat's shares failed
*John Wiley, Pounds 17.95.
to stand up on the market as well as those of its bigger competitor. One
reason put forward was that, in contrast to Queens Moat, Forte puts much
high-level energy into its relations with investment interests, not least in
gently preparing them for glitches.
Even so, keeping the share market sweet is merely a small part of the
multiplying demand on companies of appreciable size to woo the approval of
influential outsiders. Others include a welter of variegated pressure groups
together with local, national and yea supranational bureaucracies such as
the European Community.
Hence, Professor Brunsson says, jollying along influence-wielders is
increasingly becoming a full-time job which, of its nature, must largely be
done by high-ranked people. Moreover, besides being potentially at least as
decisive, the work involved in external communications differs from that of
internally managing an organisation.
Dealing successfully with the outside bodies mainly falls into the realm of
politics, which means that upper-rank jobs call more and more for political
skills in handling the mechanics of human interests, ambitions and
alliances, and the multitudinous concatenations of same. Although political
skills are also useful in managing internally, it takes a markedly different
ability to handle the mechanics of making, marketing and delivering goods
and services which people will think it worthwhile to buy.
The result is a division of skills between the externally focused top tiers
of management and the internally centred ranks lower down. True, by
comparison with heads of government, chiefs of companies are usually more
closely acquainted with what they're supposed to run. But thanks to fast
changing technologies and markets, they are hard-pressed to keep up with
developments in the methods by which their outfit's living is earned.
Nils Brunsson therefore argues that the division of skills is likely to
widen, with the chiefs of large organisations ever less capable of knowing
what can, let alone what should be done below. The dilemma is that the
selfsame chiefs are viewed as responsible for said doings by the equally
decisive external interests. So what, if anything, can be done about it?
Where answers are concerned, the Jobs column's suspicion is that the Swedish
professor will part company with the Danish premier. For it looks as though
Mr Rasmussen's aim in making his colleagues study Yes, Minister scripts is
that they'll thereby become knowledgeable enough about Machiavellian
mandarins' tactics to outsmart them at their own games, so ensuring they do
the government's bidding.
Alas it is an aim which, in Nils Brunsson's view, is doomed to fail. In any
complex organisation, he says, it's as good as impossible for people whose
jobs depend on fostering external relations to gain sufficient knowledge of
internal realities simply to impose their will on the more technically
expert staff below. So chiefs of that sort do better to accept their
limitations . . . which is where the need for humility as well as
intelligence comes in.
Certainly such chiefs must take decisions - that's what the outside
stake-holders see as their job. But chiefs should recognise that what they
decide will not necessarily or even usually be put into effect, and still
more so that attempts to force strict obedience are apt to spawn damaging
resistance.
After all, their best ally in their external dealings is a set of
technically expert supporters concentrating on keeping the organisation
doing what it's best at. So the chiefs should ensure the decisions they take
are supportive of that same end. One example Professor Brunsson cites is
decisions to do something already being done.
Most importantly, externally focused chiefs should never become involved in
the detailed implementation of what they decide, and still less show their
approval or the opposite by rewarding or punishing those held responsible.
The reason is that, if they do, their most expert underlings will stop
concentrating on productive work and start playing internal politics.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown to stress economic pragmatism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN will today take the Labour party another step along the road
towards a pragmatic economic strategy by dismissing as irrelevant
traditional internal debates on the respective roles of the state and the
market.
In the second of a series of speeches designed to map out a new approach to
the economy the shadow chancellor will argue that ideological arguments
about the private and public sectors distract from the core of Labour's
argument.
He will stress instead that the enhancement by government of individual
opportunity - using both the public and private sectors - is the
prerequisite for a successful economy.
Last month Mr Brown dropped Labour's pre-election proposals to impose
significant tax increases on the middle classes to pay for new social
welfare commitments.
That was followed by a commitment in the first of the present series of
speeches to position Labour as the party which represents the interests of
individual consumers against the entrenched and often monopolistic power of
producers.
Building on Mr John Smith's recent attempt to portray Labour as the party in
tune with the aspirations of ordinary people, the shadow chancellor will
argue today that it now regards individual and national economic success as
interchangeable.
His speech adds: 'Our argument is that people become better off learning
more, earning more and contributing to the economy by producing more. In
this way self interest equates with the national interest and, as
individuals succeed, companies and the country succeed also'.
Mr Brown blames what he calls a 'failure of ideology' by the Conservatives -
the assumption that economic prosperity will follow automatically if the
government withdraws from the market-place - for the present ills afflicting
the economy, highlighting the trade deficit, mounting public borrowing and
unemployment heading above 3m.
The shadow chancellor will set out instead Labour's alternative to use 'the
power of government' to advance industrial potential and individual skills.
That would go far beyond the training budget to fiscal, industrial,
regional, technology and social security policies.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Gummer called to account for pond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Gummer, the agriculture minister, was told yesterday by a
Westminster committee to declare in the register of MPs' interests
landscaping work on a garden pond in his garden.
Following a complaint brought by Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for
Workington, the cross-party committee of MPs interests reprimanded Mr
Gummer, saying that he should have registered the Pounds 2,000-plus worth of
work paid for by Hillsdown Holdings, the food group.
The work was carried out in connection with an informal meeting of EC
agriculture ministers in September last year, after Mr Gummer had allowed
his Suffolk home to be used to entertain visiting ministers and stage an
agricultural show.
The programme was sponsored by 100 companies including Tesco and
Allied-Lyons in order, Mr Gummer said, to ensure that there was no
particular obligation to a single company.
The report from the committee on MPs' interests emphasised the need for
ministers to keep to the rules for MPs about gifts, and not to rely just on
separate government rules.
The MPs made the same point in their inquiry last month into the failure of
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to declare an anonymous payment of some
Pounds 18,000 towards his legal bill for evicting an unwelcome tenant from
his London home, though they gave Mr Lamont the benefit of the doubt.
They said yesterday that strict observance of the Commons rules for MPs
about declaring business interests was an important way for ministers to
minimise the risks from any activity 'which overlaps the border between
their public duties and private interests'.
In his defence, Mr Gummer wrote at length to the committee, explaining that
he had been left out of pocket by having to carry out other work for the
occasion and clear up after it.
He had allowed his home to be used for the show, he said, in order 'to bring
British agriculture of all types to our guests' and strengthen the UK's
negotiating hand on issues as diverse as bananas and conservation.
He noted that 'even the cleaned out pond and the planting which is accounted
a plus is not done in the way we would have chosen'.
Mr Gummer wrote to the committee yesterday saying that he would register the
work. He also welcomed the committee's acceptance that he had not intended
to conceal the work or the fact that it was sponsored.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley accused of capitulating
to Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, ROBERT RICE and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID BLUNKETT, shadow health secretary, reacted angrily in the Commons
yesterday to Mrs Virginia Bottomley's statement on the future of London's
hospitals.
He told the health secretary that the commercialisation of the NHS and the
introduction of the internal market had turned the capital's health care
problem into a 'crisis'.
Mr Blunkett accused Mrs Bottomley of capitulating to Treasury demands for
cash to pay for the government's 'economic incompetence'.
Existing hospitals would be allowed to 'wither on the vine' while adequate
resources were not being made available to put in place the health care
needed, he said.
Mrs Bottomley said Mr Blunkett had made 'a populist, knee-jerk,
unreconstructed, destructive reaction'. It also reflected the fact that he
was sponsored by the health union Cohse, which always put jobs before
patients.
She stressed that the Pounds 170m additional money being made available to
improve primary health care in London was Pounds 30m above the figure
recommended in the Tomlinson report.
The government's proposals won a broad welcome yesterday from most of the
hospitals affected, Robert Rice and Richard Tomkins write.
Both Guy's and St Thomas' said they were pleased that Mrs Bottomley had
accepted the recommendation that they should merge as a single NHS Trust. St
Thomas' said it particularly welcomed the government's recognition of the
need for a merged accident and emergency department for south London on one
site.
University College and the Middlesex said the planned merger of the two
hospitals was in line with their own strategy.
They expected to merge on the UCH site, redeveloping it to incorporate the
Hospital for Tropical Diseases and the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear
Hospital.
The Royal London said it was uneasy about the proposal to strip it of
responsibility for community services, but it strongly welcomed the
forthcoming review of specialities. Charing Cross, which remains under the
threat of closure, said the report clearly recognised that the hospital's
specialty services had a future: it now had to be established exactly what
form that future would take.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Axe still poised over London
hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'CONCENTRATED effort' was announced by the government yesterday to improve
London's local health services and prepare the capital for hospital
closures.
Ministers have accepted the logic and implications of the Tomlinson report's
recommendations for changes in London's healthcare. They have put off
politically-sensitive decisions about hospital closures until later in the
year but set up a structure which should ensure that - unlike previous
attempts to rationalise hospital provision in London - the decisions are
eventually taken.
Final announcements on the future of some of the capital's most famous
hospitals will come after further consultation and a review of the
allocation of specialist services.
Meanwhile, action will be launched to improve general practitioner and
community services in a London Initiative Zone covering the inner city. This
is likely to lead to extra family doctors being brought into the capital on
short-term contracts, with primary care centres set up in shops, sports
centres, schools and offices.
The job of improving London's relatively poor family doctor and community
services presents ministers with a considerable challenge. But the difficult
political decisions involve hospital closures. Yesterday's announcement, in
a document called Making London Better, represents a compromise between
ministers who have advocated immediate tough action and those counselling
caution for fear of adverse public reaction.
Most of the closure options proposed in Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report
remain on the table for further consideration. A delay until the autumn will
allow the government more time to prepare a detailed case to justify
particular closures.
St Bartholomew's hospital in the City, which has run the most conspicuous
campaign against the Tomlinson report's recommendation that it should close,
remains high on the danger list.
The government intends to conduct consultations on removing its accident and
emergency facilities and says the hospital then faces one of three options:
closure, forming a combined trust with the Royal London - with the new trust
management deciding how to rationalise services - or retaining Bart's as a
much smaller specialist hospital.
The document stresses that the option of retaining a smaller, specialist
Bart's - the solution favoured by its management - 'would need to stand the
test of the specialty reviews and its costs would have to be acceptable to
purchasers'.
Ministers will consider firm proposals in the autumn. But Bart's application
to become a self-governing trust from April will not go ahead and its
management links with the Homerton hospital in Hackney - included in the
Bart's management's survival plan - will be severed.
The Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden specialist heart and cancer hospitals
in Chelsea are among the few clear winners from yesterday's announcement.
Both have campaigned powerfully against Tomlinson's recommendation to
re-house them at the Charing Cross Hospital, and the government says it is
not convinced of the case for doing so.
This decision adds to the threat facing the Charing Cross Hospital, which
Tomlinson recommended should close if the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden
did not move there. The government will consult on proposals to close its
accident and emergency department, and will consider detailed proposals for
the future of Charing Cross in the autumn.
Ministers are supporting proposals for two pairs of hospitals - University
College and the Middlesex and Guy's and St Thomas' to be rationalised on
single sites.
The London hospitals have lost Pounds 50m in contract income this financial
year and are expected to lose a further Pounds 50m next year. On a cautious
estimate, says the government document, the capital's hospitals are likely
to have to shed between 2,000 and 2,500 of their beds - between 15 per cent
and 20 per cent of the total - in four or five years.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories defend pay bodies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FORMER Tory employment ministers last night came out against the
abolition of wages councils, as MPs opposed a Labour proposal requiring the
government to make an annual report to parliament on the conditions of
low-paid workers.
Mr Peter Bottomley challenged the government to explain why it had not 'make
plain' before the last election that a move to abolish the bodies, which set
minimum pay rates for 2.5m low-paid workers, was in the offing. 'The
question is at what level is it worth taking away protection from the
vulnerable,' he asked.
Mr Jim Lester, another former junior minister, said: 'The whole
responsibility of parliament . . is to look after those least able to defend
themselves.'
But a new clause proposed by Labour forcing ministers to report annually to
parliament was defeated by 290 votes to 262 as the Trade Union Reform &amp;
Employment Rights Bill reached its Commons report stage.
MPs earlier backed a new government clause phasing out public subsidy for
union ballots - a move similarly opposed by Mr Bottomley. Mr Michael
Forsyth, employment minister, described continued subsidy as
'inappropriate.'
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, warned that 'third world' pay
levels and working practices were being introduced into Britain.
He sought to dismiss the contention that Wages Councils cost jobs, arguing
that the number of people working in the sectors they covered had actually
risen, while those employed in other industries had fallen substantially.
Labour did not believe wages councils should be abolished as the bill
proposed, but if they were, Labour's suggestions would help to protect those
affected.

MINISTERS staved off defeat in the Lords yesterday over its proposed changes

Lord Ferrers, the Home Office minister, promised that - at all the larger
British embassies and consulates dealing with immigration applications - a
new scheme would ensure that a senior manager would review at the end of
each day all refusals by entry clearance officers. Where a decision was
reversed a visa would be issued.
Peers voted 148-124 against a move to streamline the right of appeal by
introducing a role for an adjudicator who would decide whether someone
should have leave to appeal.

<TEXT>
MINISTERS staved off defeat by an all-party coalition of peers yesterday
over its proposed changes to asylum law, with a last-minute concession which
would introduce a further safeguard into the system.
Led by Lord Ackner, a law lord, many peers argued that there should continue
to be a right of appeal against refusal of entry for a short visit or as a
student, but that this would be streamlined by introducing a role for an
adjudicator, who would decide whether someone should have leave to appeal.
But Lord Ferrers, the Home Office minister, promised that at all the larger
posts abroad dealing with immigration cases a new scheme would ensure that a
senior manager would review at the end of each day all refusals by entry
clearance officers, and where a decision was reversed a visa would be
issued.
An adjudication system would, he argued, be almost as cumbersome as the
present 'appeals edifice' and was not really necessary for the problem it
was aimed at addressing.
Lord Ackner said that some form of filter was needed, because one in about
five cases succeeded in appeal last year, and there was a risk that if there
were no right of appeal the number of cases where entry clearance officers
made a wrong decision was likely to rise to one in two or three. 'Without an
opportunity to have a decision scrutinised,' he said, 'consciously or
subconsciously, arbitrariness tends to become part of the decision process'.
Baroness Flather, a Tory backbencher, said that unless there was a review
procedure the powers that entry clearance officers would have would 'not be
acceptable in a liberal democracy'.
The government won the decision by 148 votes to 124.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Former minister backs pay body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Bottomley, a former Tory employment minister, last night came out
against the abolition of Wages Councils and challenged the government to
explain why it did not 'make plain' before the last election that such a
move was in the offing, David Owen writes.
His remarks came as the Trade Union Reform &amp; Employment Rights Bill,
abolishing the councils that set minimum pay rates for 2.5m low-paid
workers, moved through its report stage in the Commons.
Mr Bottomley also opposed a government move to phase out the public subsidy
for trade union ballots. To Labour protests, Mr Michael Forsyth, employment
minister, described the continued subsidy as 'inappropriate'.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government's response to Tomlinson
receives broad welcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's proposals won a broad welcome yesterday from most of the
London hospitals affected, Robert Rice and Richard Tomkins write.
Both Guy's and St Thomas' said they were pleased that Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, health secretary, had accepted the recommendation that they
should merge as a single NHS Trust. St Thomas' said it particularly welcomed
the government's recognition of the need for a merged accident and emergency
department for south London on one site.
A Pounds 3.25m expansion of accident and emergency facilities is already
under way at St Thomas' to cope with expected rise in attendances following
the closure of the nearby Westminster Hospital.
University College and the Middlesex said the planned merger of the two
hospitals was in line with their own strategy. They expected to merge on the
UCH site, redeveloping it to incorporate the Hospital for Tropical Diseases
and the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital.
The Royal London said it was uneasy about the proposal to strip it of
responsibility for community services, but it strongly welcomed the
forthcoming review of specialities. If the accident and emergency services
department of Bart's was closed, it said, it could easily handle the extra
work. The reaction from Charing Cross, which remains under the threat of
closure, was more cautious. It said the report clearly recognised that the
hospital's specialty services had a future: it now had to be established
exactly what form that future would take.

FT  17 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Analysts unhappy with BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S flag-carrier airline, British Airways, had a volatile and busy
session as the market digested the company's third-quarter results.
Profits for the three-month period to December 1992 dropped by Pounds 80m to
Pounds 20m, but were at the top end of analysts forecasts. The initial
reaction was favourable and the shares moved ahead, with dealers also
cheered by the absence of the feared rights issue announcement.
However, closer examination of the accompanying statements and discussions
with the company, which pointed to a poor trading outlook, later brought a
change of view in the City. The shares retreated as analysts cut year-end
pre-dictions. Smith New Court reduced its forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds
230m, Lehman Brothers came back by Pounds 15m to Pounds 225m, and James
Capel by Pounds 20m to Pounds 200m.
At the day's worst, the shares were down 9 at 270p, but afternoon buying,
mainly by US houses, prompted a rally for a close of 3 off at 276p after
heavy turnover of 10m.
Bowater firm
Paper and packaging group Bowater ignored both overall market weakness and a
potentially dilutive rights issue. The shares climbed to 497p at one stage
and survived the later pressure on UK stocks imposed by sharp falls in the
US to close 8 ahead at 493p.
The company announced a one-for-six cash call at 400p per share to raise
Pounds 295m and finance the Dollars 434m (Pounds 305.6m) acquisition of US
group Specialty Coatings. Mr Tim Rothwell, media analyst with investment
bank BZW, said: 'It is a cracking deal. It is an excellent fit for their
current Rexham business and seems to be a reasonably fair price.' Bowater
also announced a 48 per cent rise in profits in 1992.
Glaxo hit again
Drugs group Glaxo fell sharply in early trading yesterday as the bears
latched on to news that the company is to cut the ex-factory price of its
migraine drug Imigran in the Netherlands by 15 per cent. There were also
recurrent worries that Glaxo is poised to announce a big rights issue to
finance an acquisition.
Finally, there was position-taking ahead of the announcement of Glaxo's
results tomorrow and reaction to US President Bill Clinton's address last
Monday which could herald a tightening of federal health spending. However,
Mr James Culverwell of Hoare Govett argues that the stock has become a
hostage to fortune. 'Glaxo is out of favour but the arguments are
misinformed,' he said.
The slide, which continued through the day to leave the stock 32 down at
667p on turnover of 6.7m, spearheaded more general weakness in the sector.
When Wall Street opened down, Wellcome lost 24 to 900p and SmithKline
Beecham fell 15 1/2 to 449p in the 'A's and 21 1/2 to 391p in the Units on
joint turnover of 9.6m.
Hanson easier
Conglomerate Hanson eased 4 to 250p after announcing first-quarter profits
of Pounds 236m. SG Warburg Securities said that even though the figure
included a Pounds 20m sale it still came in at the house forecast, which was
at the low end of market predictions and had excluded any extras.
Renewed hints of a bid for TSB rumbled on and the shares added 1 1/2 at
173p. Lloyds Bank, the favoured candidate, fell 8 to 505p.
Insurer Legal &amp; General improved 4 to 456p on the back of a bear squeeze.
Oil issues dipped as a full ministerial session at the Vienna Opec meeting,
expected to agree production cuts, was delayed. Opec had been due to hold a
full session which analysts said was expected merely to rubber stamp an
agreed cut in production quotas to a total 23.6m barrels. BP lost 5 to 262p,
Shell Transport 14 to 576p and Enterprise 10 to 458p.
Oil and gas exploration company Pittencrieff jumped 28 to 351p on news that
it plans to make its mobile communications unit an independently financed
corporation and will raise its final dividend. The company added that it had
successfully completed share placings of just over 2.1m shares at 312p per
share. Aviva Petroleum closed 3 higher at 54p on positive drilling news.
Shares in GKN bucked the poor market trend, adding 8 at 465p, with James
Capel said to have been recommending the stock.
Confirmation by Lucas Industries that it is to shed 510 jobs at its diesel
operations in Kent led to renewed bid speculation and the shares rose 3 to
146p, although the company said the move was part of its restructuring
programme.
Both British Aerospace and TI Group continued to suffer from reports that
American Airlines may return some of its 34 Airbus aircraft. The former gave
up 7 to 243p, while the latter lost 12 to 283p. A squeeze in VSEL caused the
shares to advance 8 to 591p.
Leisure conglomerate Pearson moved ahead 9 to 388p after a UK investment
bank turned buyer on the shares.
BZW shifted its recommendation from a sell, arguing that recent cost
reductions would prompt analysts to reverse their recent trend and begin to
raise forecasts.
The house said Pearson will also benefit from the strengthening dollar - BZW
has dollar/sterling averages of Dollars 1.50 for this year and Dollars 1.30
for next. Finally it is looking for UK cyclical recovery.
Selling of the BT partly-paid shares continued ahead of the payment deadline
next month and they closed 3 1/2 adrift at 297 1/2 p. The fully-paid shed 3
to 403p.
Chubb Security added a penny at 264p ahead of planned presentations to UK
analysts next week.
Investors searching for second liner bargains in the food manufacturing
sector picked out Dalepak Foods and the shares rose 12 to 274p.
Old rights issue talk descended on Cadbury Schweppes, 7 adrift at 462p.
Profit-takers took the wind from Unilever's sails, the stock tumbling 17 to
1144p. Positive press comment supported United Biscuits, steady at 348p.
Continued bid talk in Alexon was counterbalanced by speculation that the
recovery story was becoming more credible and the shares rose 6 to 89p.
Concern over the US drugs market hurt Boots, off 3 at 485p. US economic
worries also impacted on Dixons, the high street electricals retailer, which
finished 5 off at 211p.
Other stores stocks responded to a more positive CBI retail survey. WH Smith
rose 4 to 419p, Storehouse was steady at 185p, Sears gained a penny at 100p
and Marks and Spencer lost a penny at 332p. Furniture sales fared less well
in the report and MFI weakened 5 to 121p.
Several leading leisure stocks were in demand as Smith New Court renewed its
recommendation that investors go overweight in the sector. Sentiment
continued to improve in Forte following its recent financing deal and
renewed talk of acquisitions. The shares rose 2 to 192p.
Granada Group found itself in demand, with several securities houses,
including Hoare Govett and Smith New Court, recommending the stock. The
shares gained 7 at 370p.
International drinks stocks stood out, with Grand Metropolitan the best
performer for a second session as more brokers expressed enthusiasm for the
stock. Among these, BZW reiterated its positive stance, emphasising the
deflationary pressures on food costs and the attractions of the group's
mixture of businesses. In particular, the weak North American food market
was thought to be improving.
GrandMet was boosted on Monday by inclusion in NatWest Securities' Top Ten
Buy list, and the house continued yesterday to recommend a switch out of
Whitbread. The latter fell 17 to 457p.
Other domestic brewers also weakened, Courage's figures from Monday again
casting a pall. Scottish &amp; Newcastle lost 9 to 414p and Bass 6 to 567p.
GrandMet, 17 ahead at one stage, closed a net 8 up at 446p. Allied-Lyons
rose 4 to 584p and Guinness 8 to 465p.
Building group Wolseley advanced 8 to 553p on talk that SG Warburg had
reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. Meanwhile, Ibstock Johnsen
shed 2 to 47p on the announcement of Pounds 28m restructuring costs.

FT  17 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: London stocks react to US setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP reaction from both the US currency and Wall Street share prices to
President Bill Clinton's warning of higher taxes ahead pulled the rug from
under the London stock market yesterday. A recovery from early falls,
prompted by favourable views of the latest UK Public Sector Borrowing
statistics, was abruptly reversed and London fell nearly 38 points on the
FT-SE 100 scale as the Dow dropped 78 points in early trading.
London's setback, driven by a plunge in stock index futures where the March
contract fell to a discount, came almost too quickly for the bears to get
out of the market. But there was a good deal of attempted selling of the
blue chips as the pound climbed against the US dollar in late dealings.
The final minutes of the London session saw the Footsie rallying with the
Dow Average after regulatory suspension of dealing in stock index futures on
the New York market.
The final reading left the FT-SE 100 down 33.7 points at 2,812.2, after
dipping to 2,808 earlier. At 3009.5, the FT-SE Mid 250 lost 13 points.
Trading volume increased as the market fell away and traders feared that the
Footsie 2,800 mark could be tested today.
Domestic considerations were entirely blotted out by the setback in New
York. Equities had opened firmly as the January distributive trades survey
by the Confederation of British Industry appeared to indicate a modest
revival in the UK economy. But the 6-point gain on the FT-SE 100 was
replaced by a 17-point drop as traders took on board a heavy profits fall at
British Airways, a Pounds 295m rights call from Bowater and a weak opening
by stock index futures.
Selling was modest and Seaq volume was slow to climb to 400m shares. The
mood brightened quickly when news of a repayment of Pounds 3.83bn on public
sector debt in January cheered the government bond market and prompted some
economists to revise downwards their UK budget deficit forecasts.
In spite of nervousness ahead of Wall Street's reaction to President
Clinton's taxation warning, the UK market was only a few points off as
opening time for the New York market drew nigh.
But all this optimism was swept aside by the Dow's plunge and UK traders
sounded unhappy as the Dow continued its fall after the London market
closed.
Today and tomorrow could prove significant tests for the UK stock market. At
home, investors are braced for the release this morning of the January
retail sales figures and, perhaps more keenly, for disclosure tomorrow of
the unemployment data for the month.
Analysts fear that UK unemployment could breach the 3m total, perhaps even
prompting another reduction in base rates 'from weakness rather than
strength', as one senior trader suggested yesterday.
Today also brings President Clinton's State of the Union Address to Congress
and important auctions in the New York bond market, as well as the outcome
of the latest repo arrangements by the Bundesbank.
After a slow start yesterday, Seaq volume finally advanced to 634.3m shares,
of which around 62 per cent was in non-Footsie stocks. On Monday, equity
retail business worth fell to only Pounds 864.9m, the first daily total
below Pounds 1bn since the Christmas period.

FT  17 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures followed the afternoon slide on Wall Street, falling
sharply after a steady performance earlier in the day, writes Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,854. This proved
to be the high of the day and March drifted down, mainly due to a lack of
buying interest at the higher levels. By mid-morning the contract had
retreated to 2,846.
However, the release of Public Sector Borrowing Requirement figures that
were better than expected provided some comfort and caused a turnround in
the contract as buyers emerged.
But this recovery was wiped out in the afternoon when dealers in London,
seeing the falls on Wall Street as it reacted to the prospect of higher
taxes, rushed to sell March in a bout of almost panic trading. Having traded
at around fair value for most of the day, the contract fell to a discount
which was as deep as 6 points at the worst.
March finished at 2,798, just ahead of the day's low and with a fall of 55
against the previous session. Turnover, at 12,151 lots, was healthy.
Volume in the traded options was also good, reaching 34,541 contracts by the
close. The FT-SE 100 option had 9,581 lots dealt, while some 1,606 contracts
were traded in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. BP, the busiest stock option,
traded 2,568 lots, followed by Tesco with 2,093.

FT  17 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow tumbles on Clinton tax
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices tumbled across the board in very heavy trading yesterday
after investors greeted details of President Bill Clinton's economic
proposals negatively, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 82.94 down at 3,309.49, just off its
low for the day. The index has fallen 133 points, or 3.8 per cent, since it
reached a record high of 3,442.14 earlier this month.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 dropped 10.67 to 433.91, while
the American SE composite finished 9.66 lower at 405.81. The Nasdaq
composite, which has risen the furthest in recent months, was the hardest
hit index, shedding 25.15 to 665.39. Trading volume on the New York SE
swelled to 332.8m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by more than
four-to-one.
After incurring sizeable losses last week, the markets opened in a depressed
mood following the extended President's Day weekend.
Mr Bill Clinton's television address on Monday night was the main cause for
the weakness in equities. In the broadcast he warned that a wide range of
tax increases would be introduced which, coupled with selective spending
cuts, he hoped would go some way towards shrinking the huge federal deficit.
Investors disliked what they heard, fearing that the tax increases and
spending cuts would hinder the economic recovery, which has only recently
begun to gather pace. They were also disappointed that there was no mention
of a reduction in capital gains tax.
Consequently, investors rushed to liquidate some of their holdings in an
attempt to cash in profits earned during the record-breaking rally earlier
this month.
Drug and healthcare stocks were especially hard hit because of concern that
health system reforms will involve placing restrictions on pharmaceutical
prices and healthcare costs. Sector leader Merck fell Dollars 2 1/2 to
Dollars 37 7/8 , while Schering-Plough tumbled Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 59
1/2 and Pfizer Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 60 1/8 .
Leading Dow issues were all victims of the sell-off: IBM fared better than
most, losing just Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 50, while Philip Morris retreated
Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 70 3/8 and AT&amp;T Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 52 5/8 .
Airline shares were troubled by talk of a broad-based energy tax. AMR,
parent of American Airlines, fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 60 5/8 , Delta
lost Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 49 and UAL weakened Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars
119 1/2 .
On the Nasdaq market, selling was particularly fierce. Biggest losers in the
healthcare sector were US Healthcare, Dollars 2 5/8 lower at Dollars 45 3/4
, Healthcare Compare, Dollars 4 1/8 cheaper at Dollars 16 1/2 , Coventry,
Dollars 6 7/8 down at Dollars 20 1/8 , and PacifiCare, off Dollars 7 1/2 at
Dollars 40 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks retreated sharply in heavy trading as Canadian markets were
dragged down by the steep Wall Street setback.
The TSE 300 index closed 31.7 off at 3,410.5 and declines led advances by
443 to 215 after volume of 48.7m shares.
The gold shares group was a bright exception, gaining 2.3 per cent as the
spot price for gold rose USDollars 3.35 an ounce to USDollars 332.30 in New
York. Gold dealers in New York attributed the precious metal's rally to
fears about President Clinton's economic plans.

FT  17 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Late closing bourses feel
effect of US weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEFORE Wall Street opened yesterday, Frankfurt was showing relative strength
in a dull Europe and strategists were saying that the Netherlands,
Switzerland and Spain looked like better value, writes Our Markets Staff.
Afterwards, the late closing markets - including the Netherlands,
Switzerland and Spain - were more obviously marked by the Dow's setback.
PARIS had generally been inactive ahead of Wall Street but then lost 2 per
cent quickly before recovering a little in the last few minutes of trading.
The CAC-40 index finished the day 21.32 lower at 1,878.17 in turnover of
FFr2.4bn.
There was little fresh corporate news to arouse interest. CarnaudMetalbox,
which resumed trading after Monday's suspension, closed 6 per cent lower,
down FFr12.90 at FFr197.10 while CGIP, a major shareholder, dipped FFr49, or
4 per cent, to FFr1,036.
On Monday MB-Caradon of the UK said that it wanted to dispose of its 25 per
cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox and yesterday the stock market regulator said
that it had no objection to CGIP raising its stake by 7 per cent without
making a full bid.
ZURICH, which was promising a strong performance before Wall Street showed
its weakness, came back late on the Dow and the lower dollar to close with
the SMI index 14.4 down at 2,130.4.
Multinationals and banks were the chief victims. Nestle bearers eased SFr15
to SFr1,095 and Brown Boveri by SFr30 to SFr3,930 as CS Holding fell SFr40
to SFr2,130.
The chocolate maker, Lindt &amp; Sprungli, was active on continuing takeover
speculation and the bearers rose SFr600 to SFr17,700.
MADRID took one of the biggest European tumbles on theWall Street slide, the
general index closing 3.25, or 1.4 per cent lower at 233.45. Repsol went
down with the market, losing Pta40 to Pta2,800 on the day that it heralded
an international institutional placement of its equity as a further step in
its privatisiation process.
FRANKFURT refused to consolidate gains seen in London on Monday afternoon,
and the DAX index eased by 0.49 to 1,664.22 in turnover up from DM5.6bn to
DM7.3bn.
Yesterday afternoon was a different matter, as blue chips reacted
individually, rather than en bloc to the slide on Wall Street.
Volkswagen was the most serious casualty, dropping DM6.90 to DM284.10 on the
official session following the DB Research downgrade last Friday, and then
tumbling again to DM278 in the post-bourse.
AMSTERDAM declined towards the close, the CBS Tendency index falling 0.8 to
98.3. Royal Dutch lost Fl 2.10 to Fl 152.30 as the Opec meeting remained
stalled while Oce-van der Grinten fell Fl 2.40 to Fl 41.00 on a 13 per cent
decline in its 1991/1992 earnings.
Elsewhere Akzo shed Fl 1.00 to Fl 149.20 and Unilever was Fl 2.20 weaker at
Fl 195.00.
DUBLIN, with the latest close in Europe, reflected renewed sickness in the
Dow at Wall Street's midsession with the ISEQ overall index 24.32, or 1.9
per cent lower at 1,277.68.
BRUSSELS weakened with Petrofina giving up some of the gains it has made
over the last six sessions. The Bel-20 index closed 3.48 lower at 1,207.57
in turnover of BFr873m as Petrofina shed BFr40 to BFr7,980.
MILAN again featured Fiat on a day which saw mild profit-taking. Fiat,
continuing to deny reports that it might be considering reorganisation plans
or the sale of some of its assets, fixed L141 lower at L5,099 before L5,075
on the kerb.
But the group's chemicals division, Snia, attracted interest, gaining L85 to
L1,130 before rising to L1,150 on the kerb. The Comit index eased 0.02 to
500.27 on the first day of the new account.
STOCKHOLM, which extended the session by 90 minutes following earlier
technical problems, was strong in banks on hopes that proposed accounting
rule changes would benefit the sector. Handelsbanken B shares gained SKr2.50
to SKr53.00 and S-E Banken rose SKr2.50 to SKr14.50. The Affarsvarlden
general index rose a modest 0.9 to 984.6 in turnover of SKr724m.
Skandia went against the trend, falling SKr8 to SKr109 after announcing that
it would pass its 1992 dividend.
VIENNA rose on the day with a gain in the ATX index of 13.85 to 815.18.
Lenzig was one of the best performers, rising Sch16 to Sch570.
ATHENS, once again, seemed to acknowledge that some of its recent enthusiasm
had been misplaced, the general index dropping another 15.46 to 776.75. This
left it 12 per cent down from last week's 1993 peak, but still registering a
gain of over 15 per cent on the year so far.

FT  17 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average dips
below 17,000 on profit-taking

SHARE PRICES lost ground on profit-taking and arbitrage selling and the
Nikkei average closed below the 17,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 201.67 to end at the day's low of 16,916.32,
having risen to a high of 17,172.37 in the morning session, before falling
in the afternoon on heavy selling by investment trusts and tokkin, or
specified money trusts.
Volume was virtually unchanged at 220m shares, against 214m. Declines led
rises by 585 to 330, with 200 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks shed 8.43 to 1,292.33, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
eased 1.29 to 1,039.97.
Investment trusts and corporate tokkin funds which were liquidated ahead of
the March book closing depressed shares, but buying at lower levels by
public funds gave support.
Many investors remained absent ahead of an economic statement from Mr Bill
Clinton, the US president, while others were concerned about the
implications of a court trial linking Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime
minister, to dealings involving art transactions.
Electronic issues were lower on profit-taking by foreigners and
corporations. European investors were seen taking advantage of the higher
yen against European currencies, while tokkin liquidations also depressed
high-technology blue chips. Hitachi relinquished Y10 to Y685 and NEC receded
Y13 to Y637.
Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, lost Y3 to Y375 on trading
by dealers. Other car makers were also weak, with Toyota Motor down Y30 to
Y1,350 and Nissan Motor falling Y13 to Y632.
Housing-related shares, which were higher on hopes of a recovery in the
condominium market, lost ground on profit-taking. Daikyo, the leading
condominium builder, slipped Y4 to Y855 and Mitsui Fudosan retreated Y7 to
Y978. Vending machine manufacturers firmed on increased demand for smaller
vending machines: Fuji Deniki Reiki put on Y10 at Y1,820 and Sanden gained
Y12 at Y562.
In Osaka, the OSE average eased 4.17 to 18,405.85 in volume of 110m shares.
Joshin Denki, an electric appliance retailer, dropped Y110 to Y900 after
investigators raided the company's headquarters on allegations that company
officials had enlisted gangsters to oust the former president.
Roundup
THERE WERE some impressive performances in the region yesterday.
HONG KONG saw a 75-point gain eroded as investors took profits after the
market's recent strong performance on reports of an easing of political
tensions between China and Britain. The Hang Seng index closed a net 16.18
up on the day at 6,065.62 in good turnover of HKDollars 4.3bn.
HSBC Holdings again led the actives, but finished flat at HKDollars 63,
while Cheung Kong advanced 40 cents to HKDollars 21.40 and Jardine Matheson
firmed 75 cents to HKDollars 46.75.
AUSTRALIA began to take the view that the conservative opposition coalition
might win next month's federal election and the All Ordinaries index rose
15.6 to 1,612.1 in turnover of some ADollars 309m. Banks led the way, ANZ
gaining 6 cents at ADollars 3.30 and Commonwealth Bank 10 cents at ADollars
6.54.
News Corp and TNT rose after denying reports that they were seeking an
ADollars 500m loan to fund the international expansion of their jointly
owned airline, Ansett Transport Industries. News Corp added 36 cents at
ADollars 30.44 and TNT 2 cents at 78 cents.
NEW ZEALAND registered its biggest one-day advance in 19 months, as Telecom
climbed 29 cents to NZDollars 2.83 after announcing that it is to reduce its
workforce by some 40 per cent over the next four years. The NZSE-40 index
put on 48.95 at 1,621.65, its highest close since August 1990.
SINGAPORE improved on institutional buying of blue chips, the Straits Times
Industrial index rising 10.79 to 1,629.36 in turnover of SDollars 217m.
Some shipyard stocks were stronger on reports of new repair contracts, with
Far East Levingston Shipbuilding gaining 26 cents at SDollars 3.94.
SEOUL saw a morning rise fail to follow through and the composite index
finished a net 5.30 off at 672.22 in turnover of Won361bn. Many analysts
expect the market to remain flat until the new government is sworn in on
February 25.
TAIWAN declined on profit-taking, with Taiwan Cement easing TDollars 1.50 to
TDollars 57, although the financial sector remained firm. The weighted index
lost 2.03 to 3,874.73.
MANILA advanced on optimism about oil drilling tests taking place off the
south-western island of Palawan. The composite index rose 6.99 to 1,413.08
in combined turnover of 470.5m pesos.
BANGKOK saw weakness in the financial sector as the SET index fell 11.68 to
986.65 in turnover of Bt8.4bn.
Financial First City Investments, suspended from trading since Monday, said
it was deferring the repayment of matured deposits. Bangkok Bank, which has
said it might help to rescue First City, declined Bt3 to Bt137.
KUALA LUMPUR was lifted by bargain hunting in the afternoon session but the
composite index managed a gain of just 0.10 at 635.01.
BOMBAY fell for the fourth trading session, ahead of India's national budget
in 10 days' time. The BSE index shed 32.69 to 2,607.51. Selling pressure in
KARACHI was fuelled by a proposal to ban insider trading. The KSE 100 index
slipped 14.36 to 1,185.20.

FT  17 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Switzerland comes back into favour -
William Cochrane reviews European equity turnover in January
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European bourses approached the tradition of a new year rally somewhat
tentatively this year, with share price declines in France and Germany only
barely offset by gains in the UK and Italy. Where there were gains, traders
rather than investors seemed in the ascendant, and the effect on equity
market activity was generally muted.
January's bourse turnover figures, in aggregate, show a rise of 8 per cent
over December, itself only 2.8 per cent lower than in the preceding month.
Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, which produces the figures, notes
that the biggest volume gainer in January was Switzerland, which rose by 70
per cent on the month, back up to a level not seen since early 1990.
Switzerland produced a barely average advance on the month, according to the
FT-Actuaries World Indices, which had it 0.66 per cent higher over the four
weeks to January 29, against a rise of 0.63 per cent for Europe as a whole.
However, says Mr Cornish, it was the best performer in 1992, a performance
based on a strong economy and currency and a certain independence from the
strains within the ERM, and foreign investors were on feed. 'Swiss share
volumes on SEAQ International (London's screen-based trading system for
foreign stocks) rose by 46 per cent,' he says, 'indicating that non-Swiss
investors were also busy.'
Belgium had a good month, too, with a gain in turnover of 45 per cent
reflecting a rise of 5.3 per cent on the month in local currency terms. The
country had suffered from the stability of its own currency in the final
quarter of 1992, says Mr Geoffrey Taylor of Dillon Read, but the underlying
economic disciplines enabled Brussels to get its interest rates down very
sharply around the year-end.
This produced a lot of turnover in interest rate-sensitive stocks such as
Electrabel; another utility, Tractebel, saw the placing of Petrofina's stake
of around 2 1/2 per cent in mid-January inflate the turnover figures to some
extent.
The market also moved, says Mr Taylor, on the strength of the dollar and a
strong performance in cyclicals such as Arbed, the Luxembourg steel company,
Glaverbel, Solvay and Societe Generale de Belgique, whose major industrial
holdings are in non-ferrous metals, steel and cement.
Elsewhere, the Netherlands saw a gain of 17 per cent in response, says Mr
Cornish, to the market's return to outperformance, with particular help for
Royal Dutch from a 3 per cent rise in the crude oil price. The UK was up 10
per cent on the month as it reached new highs on the cut in base rates.
Germany recovered by 11 per cent after a very weak December, but the
attraction of the Frankfurt market to institutional investors has been
realised this month, following the Bundesbank's cut in key interest rates on
February 4.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar takes late knock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell sharply in late European trading as the US stock market
dropped in response to President Clinton's Monday night address, writes Emma
Tucker.
Strong signals from the US president that he plans an early assault on the
budget deficit prompted fears in the market that high tax increases would
stymie the economic recovery.
Mr Brian Hilliard, international economist at Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull, commented: 'The market is worried that President Clinton's plans
to increase taxes will slow down growth and depress company profits.'
The US currency sank more than 2 1/2 pfennigs to end in London at DM1.6315,
after Monday's close of DM1.6590. The dollar also slid against the yen to
Y119.65 from a previous Y120.90. In New York it finished at DM1.6280 and
Y119.96.
Sterling benefited from the dollar's weakness, ending almost 3 cents better
at Dollars 1.4475, and in New York it closed at Dollars 1.4485. Mr Neil
MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said the pound was
enjoying a temporary respite from bad news on the economy. He added that
today's UK retail sales figures were expected to be quite good and that the
market had already priced in a month-on-month rise of about 0.6 per cent.
A Confederation of British Industry survey earlier this week suggested that
today's official figures could show an even stronger rise. The slightly more
optimistic mood was reinforced by figures showing that the government repaid
Pounds 3.83bn last month. Although the figure will not alter general gloom
about the state of public sector finances in the UK, it was better than
forecasts for a Pounds 0.9bn repayment.
The pound was also higher against the D-Mark, closing a pfennig up on the
day at DM2.3625. In early US trading, however, sterling lost some of its
gain against the German currency, with US dealers said to be sceptical about
yesterday's relatively better economic data.
Trading in other European currencies was quiet, although the Italian lira
suffered from rumours of a corruption scandal and reports that last year's
budget deficit had overshot earlier estimates by L11,000bn.
'So long as there is a question mark over the government's ability to push
through its privatisation programme and bring down its budget deficit, there
will be problems for the lira,' said Mr MacKinnon.
It ended at L943.3 against the D-Mark, down from the previous close of
L935.0. Dealers said the next technical resting point for the lira above a
close of L945 would be L990. Pressure is said to be building on current
levels, and if political worries intensify, dealers expect the Italian
currency to lose ground rapidly.
The D-Mark was mostly stronger, climbing against the dollar, lira, pound and
yen, but it retreated slightly against the Swiss franc after Monday's firm
close.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Money Markets: European futures rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN futures markets were buoyed by yesterday's news that German civil
servants are to receive a lower than expected wage increase next year.
Mr Hermann Otto Solms, parliamentary leader of the Liberal Free Democrats,
said civil servants would get a pay rise of 3 per cent to take effect from
May 1. This was less than the market had expected and prompted an 8
basis-point gain in the March Euromark contract as dealers weighed up the
possibility that the Bundesbank might cut rates earlier than expected. The
December French franc contract rose by about 6 basis points.
The small rally was given an extra boost by a market rumour that the
Bundesbank would surprise everyone by announcing a rate reduction at its
council meeting tomorrow, and that the next set of money supply figures
would be towards the bottom end of the central bank's target range.
German call money rates were tighter, however, as strong outflows of funds
for tax payments continued to drain liquidity from the country's money
market.
In the UK, short sterling futures stood on the sidelines, trading in a very
narrow range, while longer dated interbank rates were virt-ually unchanged
on the day.
However, this inactivity masked some stickiness in Bank of England
operations, where the failure to remove a large liquidity shortage pushed
overnight rates to above 6 per cent.
In the morning the Bank announced a Pounds 950m forecast liquidity shortage,
but did not operate in the early round. A squeeze on rates at the short end
continued when the Bank revised the shortage upwards to Pounds 1.05bn but
removed only Pounds 50m. Tensions were eased in the afternoon when the Bank
more than removed the shortage by purchasing Pounds 1.01bn of bills. The
overnight rate then dropped back to below 6 per cent.
Some dealers speculated that the Bank was underlining its desire to support
sterling at current levels by deliberately keeping liquidity tight, but
others said the failure to remove the shortage in the morning reflected
reluctance among money market practitioners to part with paper.
The March short sterling contract stood at around 94.05 at the close. Mr
Nick Parsons, economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said he
expected to see the contract drift lower to around 93.82 over the next few
weeks as prospects for a pre-Budget rate cut receded.

INDONESIAN cocoa producers have advised against membership of the
International Cocoa Organisation, despite the country's emergence as a
leading world producer.
Indonesia is expected to produce 220,000 tonnes of cocoa in this crop year,
which ends on September 30, replacing Malaysia as the world's fourth largest
producer, according to the Indonesian Cocoa Association (Askindo). The
country's production has soared since 1981-82 when it produced just 23,000
tonnes. Askindo expects production to rise to 250,000 next year and to more
than 400,000 tonnes by the end of the decade.
It estimates that about 330,000 hectares (815,000 acres) are under
cultivation but only 60 per cent are in production, with the remainder
producing a first crop by 1996.
Next week members of the ICCO, which groups main consuming and producing
nations, meet in Geneva to negotiate a new price support mechanism for
cocoa.
The current agreement, signed seven years ago, has failed to maintain world
prices, which have fallen from about Pounds 1,300 a tonne in 1987 to Pounds
730. Traders say the continued refusal of Indonesia to join the ICCO would
weaken any new accord.
Indonesian producers fear membership would have a negative impact on the
domestic industry. 'We are very worried that if we become a member our
production programme may be constrained by outside factors,' explained one
executive yesterday.
Some officials also wish to remain removed from the ICCO's internal
squabbles and financial problems.
The head of one plantation company noted: 'Most important (for a new price
support agreement) is financing. But who is to pay, producers or consumers?
And what about arrears? Some producers owe the association about Dollars
140m'.
Askindo officials take a more pragmatic line, however, saying membership of
the organisation may be inevitable given Indonesia's importance as a
producer and the government's policy of promoting economic co-operation
between developing nations.
They say the preferred option for a new price support agreement would be a
withholding scheme, based on historic production levels, rather than a quota
or buffer stock systems.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Outokumpu tries to salvage
Pechenga smelter project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPERATE attempts are being made to salvage a Dollars 640m project to
renovate one of the world's biggest polluters, the Pechenga nickel smelter
on Russia's Kola peninsula, near the Finnish border.
The scheme was first aborted in March last year because of Russia's
financial problems but was resurrected when Outokumpu, the state-owned
Finnish group acting as technical manager of the proposed project,
reinstated its tender - Dollars 600m for smelter renovation and Dollars 40m
on infrastructure.
Outokumpu said yesterday that it had not proved possible to reduce the cost
of the project any further, so recent efforts had concentrated on reducing
the amount of foreign currency Russia would need by establishing how much
equipment could be supplied from that country.
This study would be completed early next month and then the proposals would
be considered by the Nordic governments. Finland and Norway have promised
environmental grants of up to Dollars 100m towards the project and, with
Sweden, have said they would provide loans for the rest of the required
investment. If Russian remained short of foreign currency, Outokumpu would
be willing to take up to Dollars 100m of nickel a year and would help repay
the banks.
Pechenga spews out about 284,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide a year. Some
falls on the nearby town of Nikel but prevailing winds take two-thirds
across Finland and Norway where the acid rain it causes has severely damaged
forests.
The project would cut sulphur dioxide emissions to only 15,800 tonnes and
enable Russia to meet the undertaking (first given by the Soviet Union) to
halve emissions in the Finnish border area.
Equally important, from Russia's point of view, the project would provide
the Norilsk nickel group, one of the country's most reliable and successful
exporters, with a new smelter. Western observers suggest that the present
Pechenga smelter, established in the 1930s and renovated in the 1940s, has
only a few years of life left.
Pechenga produces about 100,000 tonnes a year of nickel in matte (an
intermediate material), which is sent to Montshegorsk for refining. At first
the pollution abatement scheme was to have cost more than Dollars 1bn and to
have included Montshegorsk but this proved to be economically impossible
because of transport problems.
Outokumpu said yesterday there had been little progress in negotiations with
the Russians in the past year. 'But we are trying to make ourselves useful,
whatever route they choose,' said an official. Outokumpu has spent between
Dollars 3m and Dollars 5m so far on the project.

GOLD moved ahead on the London bullion market after Comex opened ahead
following the US Presidents' Day holiday. New York traders said investor
interest had been sparked by early sell-offs in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and the dollar, which had been put on the defensive by uncertainty
over President Clinton's economic plans. New York raw SUGAR prices were
sharply higher at midday, buoyed by heavy commission house and fund buying
as well as bullish chart factors. The gains were fuelled by market rumours
that Cuba had had to buy 100,000 tonnes of Thai sugar to fulfil its Chinese
contracts, and that Kenya was said to be tendering for physical sugar.
London COCOA futures were depressed by sterling's advance against the
dollar. On the LME BASE METAL trading continued in narrow ranges. Dealers
said the lacklustre markets might prevail for some time yet, as overall
physical interest and activity was slow and stocks continued to build.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Excessive stocks keep wool
market in doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD wool market has deteriorated rapidly in the past three months,
according to the latest report from the International Wool Textile
Organisation.
A forecast fall in supplies has not been as significant as expected, mainly
because of large stocks carried over in Argentina and a higher than expected
clip in Australia.
On the demand side economic problems have kept western European purchases
down, while Japan has 'excessively large' stocks of yarns, fabrics and
completed garments.
The former Soviet Union and eastern Europe, which played an important role
in expanding wool demand during the 1980s, have stayed away from the market,
while Chinese buying has not been as strong as in 1991-92.
Last week the Australian wool indicator price fell by 22 cents to 459 cents
a kilogram. The Australian Council of Wool Exporters said on Monday that
prices would remain under pressure and reported the largest offering of the
season so far - 146,594 bales.
The New Zealand Wool Board has advised its farmers not to send wool to
auction while prices are so low.
The IWTO has revised upwards its estimate for the 1992-93 clip by 3,000
tonnes and for the 1991-92 carry-over stocks by 34,000 tonnes. Total
availability of wool (production plus carry-over stocks) is now put at 2.3m
tonnes for 1992-93, up from a November estimate of 2.26m. While this is well
below the 2.45m tonnes of 1991-92, it is still well ahead of the 1986-91
average of 2.04m tonnes.
Since November the IWTO has reduced its clip estimates for New Zealand,
South Africa, Lesotho and Namibia, but has raised the Australian estimate
from 549,000 tonnes to 557,000 tonnes.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price rally cheers salmon
farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH SALMON farmers meeting in Glasgow yesterday for the start of their
annual exhibition and conference were more cheerful than for several years.
That was because the wholesale price of farmed salmon had recovered after
being at crisis levels for two years.
The happy farmers do not, however, include those from Shetland. The wrecking
of the tanker Braer at the beginning of last month spread a film of oil up
the west coast of the islands, affecting 16 salmon farms that account for
about a quarter of the 10,000 tonnes of salmon produced annually in the
islands.
Moving to protect their industry's reputation, the Shetland farmers declared
an exclusion zone over the affected area, from which no fish can be sold. It
is likely that 2.5m salmon with a market value of between Pounds 8m and
Pounds 10m will have to be slaughtered in the next few weeks and the farmers
compensated from the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund.
Salmon farmers in Norway, Scotland and Ireland have been through hell since
the late 1980s. But even Norwegian farmers accept that their own industry,
by far the largest in Europe, must take most of the blame for what went
wrong. Norway hugely increased its salmon output from 1989, reaching a peak
of 160,000 tonnes in 1991 and driving prices down sharply. Norway was
selling fish at below production cost in the European Community market - in
a word, dumping.
In late 1991 Norway began putting its house in order. Nearly 40,000 tonnes
of Norwegian salmon were bought up, frozen and disposed of outside the EC.
The EC temporarily imposed a minimum price on Norwegian imports. These
moves, plus a slight cut in Norway's output and a drop in salmon catches in
the North Pacific, have reduced world supply and enabled prices to recover.
But during the crisis many smaller Scottish salmon producers went bankrupt,
their sites being bought up by other companies. Unilever last year pulled
out of salmon farming, selling Marine Harvest, the biggest Scottish producer
which also operates in Chile, to MariFarms, a US company in which Hanson has
a large stake.
With salmon produced on a three-year cycle, Scottish farmers reined back
their growing production by reducing the number of smolts (small salmon)
they transferred to cages at sea. Scottish Office figures show that output
dropped last year to 36,000 tonnes from the 1992 record of 40,500 tonnes.
Prices rose by 35 per cent between March and September last year, and
farmers, already benefiting from low interest rates, hope UK demand will
improve this year.
Now the Scottish salmon farmers want to ensure that they never again have to
go through the perilous boom and bust cycle of the past few years, and
Norwegian, Irish and Faroese producers agree. They all propose setting up
compulsory producer organisations to control the release of smolts and
operate an intervention buying system to keep up prices.
All the producer organisations would meet twice a year in a European Salmon
Industry Forum which would review salmon breeding and try to co-ordinate
production, though its recommendations would be voluntary.
The producer organisation idea is backed by nearly 90 per cent of Scottish
salmon farmers. It received public support yesterday from Highlands and
Islands Enterprise, the development body for the Highlands, and has strong
backing in Norway. But the UK government is indicating that though it
supports voluntary organisations it would not enact legislation necessary to
make the producer organisations' rulings compulsory, which the salmon
farmers say is essential.
Mr Donald MacRae of TSB Bank Scotland says: 'It is most unlikely that the EC
Commission would agree to an international producer cartel' and asks whether
the system would be workable, arguing that farmers would produce for
intervention.
But Mr Paul Torgnes, secretary of the Norwegian Fish Farmers Association,
warned in Glasgow yesterday that Norway was now on course to more than
double its production to 310,000 tonnes in 1997. 'It is imperative that we
introduce mechanisms to prevent this development,' he said.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kuwait delays completion of
Opec's output cut deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG DISAGREEMENT between Kuwait and other members of the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries over the wording of a final communique had by
late yesterday prevented ministers from sealing a deal to cut production for
the second quarter, after nearly four days of talks.
Ministers have decided allocations for second quarter production that would
cut output to slightly less than 23.6m barrels a day, that the cuts should
in most instances be pro-rata and that the full reduction of just under 1m
b/d from the first quarter ceiling should take effect on March 1.
Kuwait has also said it is willing to pump 1.6m b/d, nearly 400,000 b/d less
than its claimed output, under this basic agreement.
But it also insisted yesterday that the communique should contain some form
of proviso making clear that present output levels were temporary and
reflected neither its eventual capacity, after full rebuilding of its
damaged oil industry, nor its historic production levels.
Iran and some other delegations, however, flatly rejected any such special
mention for Kuwait and at least three proposed drafted wordings had failed
to bring the parties closer by late last night. Almost all members believe
it is vital for Opec to produce a unanimous agreement, with no stated
reservations or exceptions, if their proposed output cut is to look fully
credible.
The row over the communique scotched momentum towards a deal that by late on
Monday was enough to persuade the Saudi Arabian's to pack their bags ready
to leave. The Algerian, Gabonese and Indonesian ministers all left on Monday
saying the basis of a deal had been reached.
But Kuwait was unwilling to budge after Mr Ali al-Baghli, the country's oil
minister, was understood to have been given assent by Sheikh Saad al-Sabah,
the Kuwaiti crown prince, to accept a level of 1.6m b/d only on condition
that there be some formal Opec acknowledgement of the Gulf state's special
status since the Gulf war.
Several delegations were again settling their hotel bills ready to leave
last night, and there was no little concern in some camps that Opec was
taking so long to finalise a deal for which an apparent pre-meeting
consensus had been so publicly trumpeted.
Although a number of industry analysts attending the meeting said the
proposed second quarter ceiling would be welcomed by the markets, if adhered
to, many also felt that much further delay in finalising the deal cast
familiar doubt on Opec's real internal discipline.
However, Kuwait is determined that the present agreement should not be seen
as somehow freezing the present accident of its lower overall output
capacity.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG 'unprepared' for mining
boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF RECENT events such as the dispute over ownership of the giant Porgera
gold mine caused international investors to turn their backs on Papua New
Guinea for a while, it might be a blessing in disguise, Mr Noel Levi, PNG's
high commissioner in London, said yesterday.
He pointed out that PNG became independent only 17 years ago and in the past
few years had attracted well over Dollars 2bn of foreign investment in
mining and oil projects while exploration expenditure by foreign companies
was running at an annual Dollars 100m. The country had been 'thrown into the
mining boom with no preparation' and might benefit from some breathing
space.
'Perhaps we need time to reflect on the past decade and to put in place
mining laws that are more up-to-date. Perhaps the present laws are not
entirely to our benefit.'
Mr Levi made it clear, however, that he, personally, wanted the USDollars
760m Lihir island gold project, which aims to develop one of the world's
biggest and lowest-cost deposits of the precious metal, to go ahead as
quickly as possible. Start-up of this project, in which RTZ, the world's
biggest mining company has an 80 per cent stake, had already been delayed
from 1992-93 to 1995, he said. 'But if RTZ wants it to happen, it will
happen.'
Mr Levi also pointed out his government's official policy was to welcome
foreign investment 'because the international business community offers
technical expertise and financial resources needed to develop our natural
resources responsibly to build national prosperity.'
At a meeting with institutional investors organised by Prudential-Bache
Securities, the financial services organisation, Mr Levi was closely
questioned about the Porgera mine. PNG has a 10 per cent stake in Porgera
but both the new prime minister, Mr Paias Wingti, and the mining minister,
Mr Masket Iangalio, have indicated this should be raised to 30 per cent,
suggestions that created a bitter dispute with the Australian partners in
the venture: Placer Pacific; Renison Goldfields; and a subsidiary of MIM
Holdings.
It was suggested by Mr Iangalio on Monday that the dispute would be settled
by the end of this week but Mr Levi pointed out that so far the PNG cabinet
had not been asked to approve any move to raise the Porgera stake or to
allocate money to pay for it.

import curbs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICAN exporting countries have accused the European Community of
hypocrisy following its decision to impose import restrictions on their
bananas.
In Costa Rica president Rafael Calderon declared that 'we will continue to
fight if the Europeans are not prepared to do us justice. We will fight
within Gatt (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), though that does
not preclude (other) settlements.'
A commission of the region's banana producing countries is trying to
establish whether the EC's decision actually violates Gatt norms and EC Gatt
representatives are being asked to justify the measures
Meanwhile Mr Guillermo Endara, the Panamanian president, declared that EC
leaders had 'no idea what damage they were causing to our countries'.
In Ecuador, the world's largest banana exporter, the foreign minister, Mr
Diego Paredes, said, however, that his country was not considering
retaliatory measures. Ecuador believed in free trade, he said.
The minister announced that a delegation would travel to Europe early next
month to seek negotiations and make leaders there more 'sensitive to the
problems the import restrictions are causing'.
Last Friday the presidents of the region's banana producing countries
rallied together in a display of solidarity, pledging to challenge the EC
import restrictions.
Yet despite a unanimous condemnation of the EC decision, the nine state
representatives stopped short of adopting more aggressive measures. The idea
of using the Panama Canal to put pressure on some EC countries was rejected
by President Endara, who said that international agreements forbade such
action.
Ecuador has begun to seek alternative markets. Negotiations are under way
with Middle and Far East countries and sales have already been clinched in
Iran.
The import restrictions come at a time when many Latin American countries
have recently made considerable investments to increase banana production.
Mr Sixto Duran Ballen, president of Ecuador, declared that: 'The developed
countries are now showing us that free trade is only a farce. Protectionism
is returning, this time hiding behind more powerful economic blocs'.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Kingdom of Sweden to join the rush for
global issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international debt market is braced for a further onslaught of global
deals today, when the previously-announced yen issue for the World Bank is
expected to be launched.
The World Bank is widely expected to raise between Y200bn-Y250bn through a
10-year deal priced to yield 25 to 26 basis points above the benchmark
Japanese government bond No 145.
Meanwhile, the Canadian province of Quebec's first global bond offering, a
30-year deal raising a larger-than-expected CDollars 1.4bn, was launched
late yesterday. The issuer had said it would be raising a minimum of
CDollars 1bn.
Of the total amount raised, CDollars 150m was placed with the Caisse des
Depots, the Quebec government pension fund, which an official at the joint
lead manager, Merrill Lynch, said was a typical feature. He also confirmed
market talk that the bond was practically sold out before its official
launch.
Quebec's issue is due to be priced today to yield 90-91 basis points above
comparable Canadian government bonds, in line with market expectations.
The Kingdom of Sweden joined the rush yesterday when it announced that it
would be launching its first global bond in the near future. Syndicate
managers expected the US dollar deal to be launched this week.
This offering will almost complete the country's SKr230bn (Dollars 31bn)
foreign borrowing programme which was announced late last year. To date,
SKr200bn has been raised.
Officials at Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers, which have been appointed
as joint lead managers and book runners of the Swedish offering, said the
issue was expected to raise around Dollars 2bn. Both the Canadian province
of Ontario and the Republic of Finland have raised Dollars 3bn through
global offerings in the past.
Some syndicate managers said they expected the Swedish deal to be priced to
yield 45-47 basis points above 10-year US Treasuries, though others said the
pricing was more likely to be pitched in the low to mid-40s range.
Mr Staffan Crona, director-general of the Swedish National Debt Office, said
that after this deal, Sweden would continue to borrow in the foreign debt
market but not as heavily as in recent months.
He added that half of the funds raised to date in the foreign debt market
have been used to shore up the Swedish central bank's foreign exchange
reserves and the remainder has been used to finance the country's budget
deficit.
In the current fiscal year, ending June 30, the Swedish budget deficit is
forecast to be SKr200m but is expected to narrow to SKr160bn in the next
fiscal year.
Elsewhere, the current fashion for Canadian dollar bonds continued as the
European Investment Bank raised CDollars 350m via a seven-year deal priced
to yield 27.5 basis points over the Canadian government bond yield curve.
Syndicate managers said the EIB's deal had gone well considering it had been
pitched at an area of the yield curve where there is little natural demand -
there is no benchmark seven-year Canadian government bond, for example - and
in view of its ungenerous pricing.
All the recently-launched Canadian dollar Eurobonds have had maturities of
three, five or 10 years, so the seven-year area stood out as the obvious
gap, syndicate managers said.
There were reports in the afternoon that the European Investment Bank was
going to launch a Ecu500m seven-year Eurobond today. The bank's president,
Mr Ernst-Gunther Broder, said in Lisbon that the EIB planned to issue up to
Esc70bn worth of escudo Eurobonds in 1993, following a successful Esc10bn
offering two weeks ago.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: PSDR data spark switching into long-dated
paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long end of the gilts market rallied nearly half a point yesterday, on
better-than-expected public sector debt repayment (PSDR) figures in January.
The news prompted switching into long-dated paper, causing a further
flattening of the curve.
The market had already rallied sharply on Friday, when the retail price
index in the year to January fell to 1.7 per cent.
The Bank of England took advantage of the market's strength to issue Pounds
1.2bn of 9 per cent stock due 2011 and Pounds 150m of 4 1/8 per cent
index-linked Treasury stock expiring 2030.
The market absorbed the extra paper easily, taking comfort from the fact
that the government is now well ahead on its funding.
ELSEWHERE in Europe, investors continued to view the German market as a safe
haven. The spread between 10-year French OAT and German bund yields widened
to 89 basis points, from 82 basis points last week. Dealers said that
although the bund market is not particularly bullish, some nervousness about
the franc is encouraging investors to switch.
The spread against Danish and Belgian bonds has also widened on fears of
further currency turmoil. The margin between 10-year German and Danish bond
yields has widened to 184 basis points, while the spread between German and
Belgian 10-year yields has increased to 77 basis points.
TREASURY prices were mixed yesterday as the market digested President
Clinton's deficit-reduction plans. In late trading the benchmark 30-year
government bond was down  7/32 at 99 23/32 , yielding 7.138 per cent. At the
short end, however, prices remained firm, with the two-year note up  3/32 at
100 1/4 , to yield 4.098 per cent.
The president's televised address on Monday night, in which he outlined his
proposals to cut the deficit, was initially well received by the bond
market. By mid-morning New York time, however, local investors' enthusiasm
for Treasuries had waned, and long-dated prices soon moved into negative
territory due to lack of domestic demand.
The long end was also pressured by more good economic news. The Johnson
Redbook service reported a 6.3 per cent rise in US store sales during the
second week of January.
THE government bonds table includes three new benchmark issues from today: a
9 per cent Belgian government bond due 2003, a 6 1/4 per cent US Treasury
due 2003 and a 7 1/8 per cent US Treasury due 2023.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Goldman Sachs wins key role
in Repsol share sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPSOL, the Spanish state-controlled energy group, yesterday appointed the
US investment bank Goldman Sachs as global co-ordinator of a planned share
issue that is expected to raise at least Dollars 500m.
The decision to appoint a separate co-ordinator - Lazard continues to advise
on the overall management of the transaction - reflects the scale and
complexity of the deal, which is likely to have one of the biggest
international distributions of any share issue this year.
More than three-quarters of the shares are expected to be sold abroad in the
first large Spanish share issue targeted exclusively at institutional
investors.
Previous privatisation issues have been sold mainly to retail investors in
Spain, involving lengthy underwriting periods and a fixed price for the
shares.
The latest Repsol offer, by contrast, will be the first Spanish share sale
to be conducted on the international book-building model.
The placement, which is likely to reduce state-held equity in Repsol from a
54.5 per cent to around 47.5 per cent, will be divided into five tranches -
Spain, the US, the UK, continental Europe and the rest of the world.
Analysts believe it will be weighted strongly towards Wall Street.
The issue is due in the first half of the year, though the good market
conditions at present mean that the sale is likely to be launched early,
perhaps as soon as the end of next month.
In an attempt to spread the spoils of the placement among the domestic
banking sector, Repsol named Banco Bilbao Vizcaya as joint global
co-ordinator and appointed the rival big commercial bank, Banco Central
Hispano, lead manager of the Spanish tranche.
Banco Santander de Negocios, Spain's premier merchant bank, will jointly
lead the UK tranche with SG Warburg.
Goldman Sachs co-ordinated the placement of 26 per cent of Repsol's shares
in 1989.
It also led a subsequent major flotation by Endesa, the state-controlled
electrical utility.
The renewed business that Goldman Sachs has won from Repsol underlines the
pre-eminence that the US bank has established in major Spanish deals.
Repsol said that Paribas and Credit Suisse First Boston would be joint
leaders of the continental Europe tranche.
Morgan Stanley has been entrusted with the placement in the rest of the
world, it added.

STANDARDS for trade data messages, aimed at reducing the risk of errors in
cross-border transactions, are to be developed by 21 of the world's leading
securities industry bodies.
At a recent exploratory meeting in Brussels, organised by the Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, the group agreed to set up
by mid-year a neutral standards advisory board representative of and visible
to the securities markets worldwide, as well as a framework to prevent
duplicated or fragmented work on standards.
Both bodies will be recognised by the International Organisation for

of securities message standards.

<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Meff, the Spanish Financial Futures and Options Exchange in
Barcelona, yesterday announced plans to cut fees and extend trading hours on
its Spanish government bond futures contracts.
Trading in three-year and 10-year bond futures on Meff will be extended by
more than an hour each day, and fees reduced to a fixed level of Pta75 (63
cents) per contract side - a 70 per cent reduction from average 1992 levels.
The move comes in response to a decision by the London International
Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) to launch a 10-year Spanish
government bond future next month, in competition with Meff. Mr Jose Luis
Oller, Meff's chief executive, responded fiercely to Liffe's plans, when
they were announced earlier this month, saying that the rival contract would
split liquidity and segment the market.

<TEXT>
TELECOM Corporation of New Zealand yesterday reported a 9.7 per cent
improvement in third quarter net profit to NZDollars 121m (USDollars 65m)
and announced a redundancy and restructuring programme aimed at shedding
about 5,000 jobs.
Mr Roderick Deane, chief executive, said that Telecom, which is 68.2 per
cent owned by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of the US, was on target to report
improved earnings for the full year, despite redundancy costs of NZDollars
350m.
The redundancy costs, which will be treated as an abnormal item, are part of
a restructuring over the next four years that will cut staff numbers from
12,600 to 7,500.
Net earnings for the nine months ended December, were 5.3 per cent higher at
NZDollars 305.8m. For the whole of last year Telecom's net profits totalled
NZDollars 402.3m.
Mr Deane said that the restructuring was designed to rationalise the
company's structure by combining its four operating companies into one.
It would also substantially improve service quality and reduce operating
costs.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fujitsu launches multi-media
games machine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU, the world's second largest computer company after International
Business Machines, took a bold first step into the consumer electronics
market with the launch yesterday of a multi-media video games machine.
The new machine, which is a multi-media CD-ROM player, plugs directly into a
television set to display images, graphics and text stored on a compact
disc.
It will also play conventional CDs and comes with a floppy disc drive to
display material compiled on a PC.
The new machine, which goes on sale in Japan this month and will be known as
Marty, marks a diversification for Fujitsu into the highly competitive
consumer electronics market.
It also reflects the blurring of borders between the computer and consumer
electronics industries with the spread of digital technology.
Computer manufacturers in the US and Japan have been working to develop
multi-media technology, which combines data, graphics, text, video and
sound, not only as an added feature for PC users but as a means to enter the
consumer market.
Dataquest, the high technology consultancy, expects the multi-media market
to be worth Dollars 1.6bn by 1996.
For Fujitsu, the move is a logical step after the launch of its multi-media
PC, FM Towns, four years ago.
The consumer machine will run software for FM Towns in addition to titles
which will be launched specifically for the new consumer machine. Fujitsu
plans to have 300 software titles available by the end of March and 400 by
the end of the year. It aims to sell 200,000 of the new machines in the
first year.
However, Fujitsu's foray into the home entertainment and education market
faces substantial hurdles.
The market already appears crowded, with Nintendo and Sega, the video games
manufacturers, maintaining a firm grasp on the hearts and minds of young
games players. The two companies have a distinct advantage over newcomers in
the large number of installed machines and the popularity of their games
titles, and have been moving aggressively into new software developments
such as games using real film footage.
Meanwhile, other companies, such as Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics
manufacturer, and Tandy of the US have launched their own CD-based
multi-media entertainment machines that aim to provide more than video
games.
Fujitsu does not have any experience of marketing consumer products. The
company has set up a consumer products division in its personal business
department, and plans to market the new machine not only in electronics and
computer stores, but also through retailers such as department stores,
supermarkets and electrical goods stores.
Although Fujitsu has attempted to differentiate its new machine from
conventional video games machines by emphasising its educational potential,
there is little evidence to suggest that the appeal of educational material
could provide a strong boost to sales.
For Fujitsu, the move is a gamble. In the six months to September 1992, it
posted its worst results, turning in a loss of Y7.5bn (Dollars 62m) on a
consolidated basis against a profit of Y30.9bn previously.

growth

<TEXT>
SCITEX, the Israeli maker of colour electronic pre-press systems, yesterday
reported a net profit of Dollars 122.3m in 1992, a 22 per cent increase over
the previous year, as strong growth in both the US and Europe took sales to
Dollars 550m.
Although profit growth was less than in the three previous years in
percentage terms, the results further entrenched Scitex, which is traded on
the New York over-the-counter market, as the star of Israel's successful
high-tech industry.
Mr Giora Bitan, finance director, said demand for Scitex's range of
computerised products for the publishing, printing and graphic design
industries had grown despite a second year of low or negative overall growth
in the company's main markets in north America and western Europe.
He said half of 1992 sales were to new customers. The trend of ungrading
technology in these sectors was not exhausted.
Scitex said fourth-quarter sales of Dollars 153m were 31 per cent ahead of
the same 1991 period and almost one-third were accounted for by products
introduced in 1992.
Over the year, sales to the 'mid-range' market of small print houses, a key
growth target, reached Dollars 69m, compared with Dollars 25m in 1991.
International Paper of the US bought an 11 per cent stake in Scitex during
the year for more than Dollars 200m. This helped leave Scitex with a
year-end cash balance of Dollars 325m. Mr Bitan said he was actively looking
for further acquisitions.
He said Leaf, the US maker of photo-scanning and transmission systems,
bought for Dollars 35m last year, had made a second-half loss which knocked
4 cents per share off Scitex's fourth-quarter earnings.

SAMANCOR, the South African chrome and manganese ore and alloys producer,
yesterday reported a 27 per cent fall in attributable net profits to R110.8m
(Dollars 35.5m) for the six months to December.
Earnings per share tumbled 31 per cent to 59 cents. The company is halving
its dividend to 20 cents a share.
Mr Hans Smith, managing director, said no ferrochrome producer was making
money at current prices. Samancor's ferrochrome operations were running at
about 40 per cent of installed capacity, he added.
Although Mr Smith is keen to stress the success of the restructuring and the
healthy state of Samancor's balance sheet - available cash resources stand
at about R500m - the figures tell a grim story.
Adjusted to take account of the Middelburg Steel acquisition, turnover
declined by 11 per cent to R930.9m and pre-tax profits fell by 72 per cent
to R71.4m, taking in a R42m one-off retrenchment charge
The real trouble for Samancor came on the ferrochrome side, where large
volumes of distress sales from the CIS and former eastern bloc countries
played havoc with the market.

STRONG pharmaceuticals sales helped Sumitomo Chemical to a 28 per cent
increase in consolidated profits before tax in the year ended December, the
company reported yesterday.
However, on an unconsolidated basis, pre-tax profits fell 63.6 per cent to
Y8.9bn (Dollars 74.1m), the third successive annual decline.
Overall unconsolidated sales fell by 11 per cent to Y624bn.
Sales of basic chemicals, which account for about 60 per cent of overall
sales, fell by 13.4 per cent.
Aluminium sales dropped by 21.1 per cent.
Sumitomo Chemical's consolidated income before tax rose to Y40.2bn from
Y31.2bn.
Net income fell by 19 per cent to Y16.3bn.
Net sales fell by 6 per cent to Y1,018bn.
However, a 19 per cent drop in basic chemicals, mainly petrochemicals
supplied to the rest of Japanese manufacturing, was largely offset by a 8
per cent growth in sales of speciality chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
Operating income was marginally lower at Y53.7bn, compared with Y54.2bn the
year before.
The growth of the comp-any's speciality chemicals division was mainly due to
a 21 per cent growth in sales of its pharmaceuticals.
Sales of fine chemicals were also up largely through supplies to other
pharmaceuticals producers.

<TEXT>
THE senior ratings of Mitsubishi Corporation and Marubeni Corporation, the
leading Japanese trading houses, were downgraded yesterday by Moody's
Investors Service, the ratings agency. Moody's said both corporations took
on extra risk through diversification programmes in the late 1980s.
Mitsubishi's rating was lowered from Aa3 to A1, while that of Marubeni was
downgraded from A2 to A3. This means both companies retain investment-grade
ratings. But the downgrading may mean they face slightly higher costs in
raising new funds.
The downgrading of Mitsubishi comes as a surprise in Japan. Under the
stewardship of Mr Shinroku Morohashi, its chairman, it is regarded as one of
the country's most solid institutions, although net profits are expected to
be halved for the year ending March.
Moody's suggested its core trading business had been eroded through
increased competition, prompting Mitsubishi to diversify into satellites,
cable television, and a broad range of direct investments.
Similar observations were made about Marubeni, though Moody's noted the
downturn in international property had affected its development and
construction businesses.

AMPOLEX, the Australian energy group, yesterday announced a 114 per cent
increase in net profit to ADollars 29.8m (USDollars 20m), largely thanks to
revenues from the Kutubu oilfield in Papua New Guinea.
Ampolex said operating profit increased by 207 per cent to ADollars 67.5m in
the six months to the end of December, reflecting a 100 per cent increase in
sales of crude oil to a record 6m barrels.
Net profit was reduced by an increase in tax payments from ADollars 8m to
ADollars 37.6m, mainly as a result of exposure to higher tax rates in PNG,
where the group paid tax of ADollars 28.2m.
Revenue increased from ADollars 89m to ADollars 238.3m, reflecting the
group's 16.46 per cent share of Kutubu output and revenue from the resale of
oil purchased from other Kutubu producers.
Ampolex said Kutubu production is expected to rise to an average of 120,000
barrels a day in the second half, compared with 114,000 barrels in December
and 99,000 barrels over first six months.
The group said gas production for the period rose by 15 per cent to 1bn
cubic feet, due mainly to higher output from its US interests.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Kawasaki Steel warns of loss due
to US shake-up

KAWASAKI Steel yesterday warned that it was heading for a consolidated loss
this year, mostly because of difficulties with its US joint-venture, Armco
Steel.
The warning underlines the mounting costs which Japanese manufacturing
companies face from their aggressive expansion in the late 1980s.
Most of Japan's leading steel makers formed joint ventures in the US in the
second half of the 1980s, partly to supply Japanese car manufacturing plants
which were being set up in North America.
The US steel industry welcomed the injection of Japanese capital and
technology to help them out of a structural crisis. During the late 1980s,
low interest rates in Japan meant many Japanese companies were able to raise
funds for international expansion extremely cheaply.
However, it is now thought that most Japanese steelmakers are losing heavily
on their US joint ventures, which have required substantial investments in
technology and management to compete effectively with low cost mini-mills.
Kawasaki Steel, which is engaged in an extensive restructuring of domestic
plants, said it expected to make an after tax loss of Y29bn (Dollars 240m)
for the year ended March. It made a net profit of Y14bn in 1991-1992.
The company's unconsolidated pre-tax profit is expected to fall 66 per cent
to Y18bn on sales of Y1,320bn, down 4.2 per cent.
The consolidated loss is mainly due to the cost of restructuring Armco
Steel, a joint venture with Armco, the US steel maker.
The joint venture declared an extraordinary loss of Dollars 300m after
writing off some of its production facilities in an attempt to modernise
production and reduce costs.

AT&amp;T, the US communications and computer group, announced yesterday that it
will take a Dollars 7bn charge in the first quarter of this year to comply
with a new standard of accounting for the post-retirement health benefits of
employees.
The size of the charge was at the high end of the company's own forecast,
which had originally put the post-tax liability of the accounting change at
between Dollars 5.5bn and Dollars 7.5bn. In the wake of yesterday's
announcement AT&amp;T's share price fell Dollars 1 1/4 to close at Dollars 52
5/8 in a broadly weaker stock market.
AT&amp;T said that the accounting change would have no effect on its present and
future retirement health benefits, nor would it affect the company's cash
flow, its long-term earnings objectives or its ability to pay for dividends,
research and development and capital expansion programmes.

CANADIAN Pacific, the transport, resources and industrial holdings group,
has bought Compagnie Maritime Belge's 43 per cent stake in their joint
venture Canada Maritime - the container shipping service which operates
between Montreal and several European ports.
The price of the deal was not disclosed, but CP also acquired two older
container vessels from CMB.
Canada Maritime was formed by CP and CMB in 1984 in a broad consolidation of
north Atlantic container services following the severe 1982-83 recession.
Container rates hit new lows last year but north American shipping lines
have pushed container rates up by 10 to 15 per cent and this has improved
returns.
Eastbound traffic is firming, say shipping sources, but westbound is still
very depressed.
The Canada-Europe container service will continue to be dominated by Cast
North America and Canada Maritime, now fully owned by CP.

HONEYWELL, the US elec-tronics and controls group, saw final quarter net
profits slip to Dollars 29m from Dollars 102.6m in the same period a year
ago. Earnings per share fell to Dollars 0.21 from Dollars 0.73.
The company said its fourth quarter figures included a Dollars 3.1m loss on
early redemption of debt. Revenues in the quarter were essentially flat at
Dollars 1.71bn.
For the full year, the company reported profits after tax down to Dollars
246.8m from Dollars 331,100. Earnings per share were Pounds 1.78 compared
with Dollars 2.35 in 1991. Revenues fell slightly to Dollars 6.19bn from
Dollars 6.22bn. Honey-well said net earnings were affected by an Dollars
8.6m charge for early redemption of Dollars 180.8m of long-term debt.
The full year figures also included a Dollars 85.1m or Dollars 0.l62 a share
after-tax charge for the costs of restructuring three business segments.
Honeywell yesterday announced that Mr Michael Bonsignore would take over
from Mr James Renier as chairman and chief executive in April. Mr
Bonsignore, aged 51, has been an executive vice-president and board member
since 1990.
Mr Larry Moore, aged 56, was named as president and chief operating officer.

BELLSOUTH, the largest of the Baby Bell regional telephone companies that
was spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984, yesterday unveiled plans to spend up to
Dollars 9bn during the next three years updating its telecommunications
network.
The Atlanta-based company said Dollars 5.7bn would be spent to keep up with
the business' growth and to replace outdated equipment, and another Dollars
3bn would be invested in newer technology for the network infrastructure.
Some of the money will go towards the installation of more fibre optic cable
and the continued replacement of analog central offices with digital
equipment.
So far, BellSouth has installed 900,000 miles of fibre optic cable in its US
network and plans to install fibre-to-the-curb systems for 130,000
residential and business customers over the next three years.
The incorporation of self-healing capabilities into the network to enhance
reliability will also continue under the capital investment programme.
In a separate development, BellSouth said it has signed preliminary
agreements with Intel, RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson Telephone to develop new
products and services for the mobile computing market.
The four companies said they planned to expand the availability and increase
the usage of standard Intel processor-based mobile computers able to perform
two-way wireless communications via the nationwide dedicated public mobile
data networks run by RAM.

CIGNA, one of the largest composite insurance companies in the US, yesterday
announced a sharp drop in fourth quarter earnings to Dollars 50m, down from
Dollars 108m a year earlier, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Full year 1992 profits of Dollars 311m were also well down on the previous
year, when the company earned Dollars 449m, although the latest results were
depressed by a Dollars 26m charge to cover the adoption of new accounting
standards.
Cigna's earnings would have been considerably worse but for realised
investment gains, which brought in Dollars 19m in the fourth quarter and
Dollars 192m in the year. Investment gains in 1991 netted only Dollars 52m.
The company said its property and casualty operations incurred a loss of
Dollars 374m last year, despite investment gains of Dollars 111m.

<TEXT>
LOSSES at Abitibi-Price, the Canadian forestry group, almost quadrupled last
year as a result of the severe slump in the newsprint and other paper
markets.
The loss from continuing operations was CDollars 200m (USDollars 160m), or
CDollars 2.91 a share, up from CDollars 58m, or 86 cents a share, in 1991.
The company also reported a loss of CDollars 19m last year from businesses
which have been classified as discontinued operations, compared to a
CDollars 18.2m loss in 1991.
In spite of an increase of almost 10 per cent in sales volumes, revenues
were almost unchanged at CDollars 1.7bn.
Metall Mining, the Canadian mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft
group, is buying out the 49.6 per cent minority holding in Minnova, a
Canadian exploration and development company, in a deal worth CDollars 115m
(USDollars 90.8m), writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Metall will offer one of its own shares and CDollars 4 cash for each Minnova
share it does not own. At Monday's market price for Metall, the offer is
worth about CDollars 16.12 per Minnova share, representing a premium of
about CDollars 2 over the market price of Minnova shares.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Price cuts are back in fashion
at Benetton - The priority is to increase sales through international
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S Benetton clothing group will announce a 10 per cent rise in 1992
sales when the group's results are revealed next month. Sales will be about
L2,500bn (Dollars 1.61bn) on earnings which will have remained static at
worst.
But the upbeat figures will again raise doubts about how long the company,
never shy of publicity, can continue raising turnover and earnings at a time
of worldwide recession.
In spite of the downturn in consumer spending, Benetton's profits should at
least equal the net L164.8bn made in 1991. In the first half of last year,
net earnings climbed by 6 per cent to L92.8bn on a 6.9 per cent sales rise
to L1,233bn.
The expected increase in profits has triggered hopes of a higher dividend,
already boosted last year by L50 a share to L300. In 1991, shareholders were
shocked when the company halved its L500 a share payout to generate extra
cash at a time of continuing sharp growth.
Last year's dividend rise restored confidence in Benetton's payout policy.
'Now we've established this good relationship, it's important to maintain
it,' hints Mr Luciano Benetton, managing director.
The company's priority is still to increase sales by expanding
internationally. It has just opened its 7,047th store, this time in Cuba.
But early indications for this year suggest even Benetton's sales growth
could be turning more sluggish.
Turnover growth has fallen below last year's 10 per cent level. 'But we hope
to pick up in the second half,' says Mr Benetton. Benetton has cut prices by
up to 15 per cent this year in order to improve competitiveness.
The price cuts vary between markets and seasons. While price tags in Italy
have hardly changed, prices in France, Germany and the US will be between 6
per cent and 10 per cent lower.
The decision to cut prices was made six months before the lira left the
exchange rate mechanism last September and before the landmark agreement in
July between employers and unions to abolish Italy's 'scala mobile' (wage
indexation system). Both were windfalls for many Italian manufacturers.
'We acknowledged our markets were becoming more difficult,' says Mr
Benetton. 'So we tried to improve the appeal of our products by cutting
prices.'
The strategy has been conducted without putting profits at risk, he claims.
Internal costs have been squeezed. 'We have frozen our costs for the past
two years and expect to do the same in 1993.' Lower borrowing has helped too
by reducing interest charges.
Benetton has been sending a similar pricing message to its hundreds of
independent suppliers although Mr Benetton denies the group has demanded
lower prices. He does admit, however, to having looked askance on suppliers
pushing for price rises.
Highly-geared suppliers have been treated with particular caution, on the
grounds that companies facing heavy interest charges are unlikely to be
pricing as keenly as those with more solid balance sheets.
Mr Benetton acknowledges that last year's 'scala mobile' deal and the lira
devaluation provided unexpected benefits. The two developments have given
Italian exporters an edge after years of declining competitiveness.
The labour agreement 'came out better than we had budgeted,' he says. And
the devaluation of the lira, which has fallen by about 20 per cent against
the D-Mark, has greatly enhanced competitiveness. Meanwhile, recession and
oversupply mean important raw materials, such as wool and cotton, have not
gone up in price in spite of the lira's fall, says Mr Benetton.
Exchange-rate factors will only come through fully in the 1993 accounts,
although there will be some limited effect this year, he says. In spite of
the recession, he remains confident about the year ahead. Sales of the
spring-summer 1993 collection, already ordered by retailers, have exceeded
levels for same season in 1992 - even excluding the additional small orders
that filter through later in the season. Based on such indications, Mr
Benetton's expects turnover to rise by 7 to 8 per cent this year.
But even Benetton has its problems. Plans to expand in Russia, where there
are now 10 of the group's stores, have gone adrift due to the severe slowing
of production at the Armenian factory set up to supply the new shops.
Matters are as gloomy in the US, where Benetton is still struggling to find
the right niche and pricing for its goods. Such difficulties have led to
heavy losses and closures. The store network has been cut to around 300
units from a peak of 700 in 1987.
Mr Benetton admits the company's clothes are 'too expensive' in the US. 'We
have the image of being more of a luxury goods there.'
Theoretically, Benetton should be isolated from such problems. Under its
store licensing system, it is the retailer, rather than the manufacturer,
which bears the burden of pricing policy in the high street - Benetton's job
is done once retailers buy its collections. However, Mr Benetton admits the
group has been hurt by the bankruptcy of several US outlets.
'With the lira having fallen to L1,500 against the dollar, I think we now
have a chance with products made in Europe,' he says. 'We feel very commited
to this market.' Benetton's bruises in the US have given it vital, if
costly, experience in one of the world's toughest retailing markets.
'And that experience comes in very useful elsewhere,' Mr Benetton adds.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sparkle goes out of glamour
stock - Malaysia's partially privatised power utility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's electricity utility, was partially
privatised early last year, it became an instant glamour stock.
Within hours, shares were changing hands at nearly double the initial
offering price of MDollars 4.50 (USDollars 1.70). Tenaga quickly became
Malaysia's biggest listed company, with a market capitalisation of nearly
MDollars 30bn (USDollars 11.4bn), accounting for more than 20 per cent of
total stock market value.
But the lustre has gone out of Tenaga. Both local and foreign investors have
become disenchanted and on the Kuala Lumpur stock market last week the
shares fell 7 per cent, reducing the total market value of the company from
MDollars 28.35bn to MDollars 26.4bn.
The reasons for Tenaga's decline range from acts of God to management
deficiencies and political in-fighting. Things started to go wrong on
September 29 last year, when the lights went out through most of peninsula
Malaysia.
Power in many areas was restored only after several days. Preliminary
estimates of industrial losses due to the blackout came to more than
MDollars 200m. Mr Samy Vellu, the energy minister, blamed the power failure
on a freak lightning strike - an 'act of God'.
Not everyone, and that includes some government ministers, was satisfied.
While about 25 per cent of Tenaga is in private hands - with a fifth of that
controlled by foreign fund managers - the company is still under the control
of the ministry of finance.
Critics say Tenaga is still bureaucratically run, with little accountability
in many areas and too much government interference. The company also finds
itself caught up in high-level political arguments between Mr Vellu and
other cabinet ministers.
There has been anger that a full report on the September 29 blackout has
still not been made public. Recent nervousness about Tenaga has been caused
by renewed blackouts in many areas.
But the company says that essential maintenance and building work means that
a certain amount of power shedding will continue for another year. It says
peak demand in Malaysia's fast growing economy has been greater than
anticipated and has called on heavy industrial users to adjust working hours
to off-peak periods.
This suggestion does not seem to have gone down well with industrialists or
with some members of the government. Mrs Rafidah Aziz, who, as minister of
trade and industry, deals with foreign investors in the country, describes
as 'intolerable' the number of complaints she has received.
'Tenaga's current performance is not up to the mark,' she says.
A system of rebates has been proposed to compensate industrialists. But some
companies say they are investigating legal action against Tenaga. Most
worrying for Tenaga and its future prospects have been suggestions that
other companies be invited to participate in running the national grid, now
solely in its hands.
Independent power producers have already been invited to build, operate and
own a number of power stations in Malaysia. The first such project, a joint
project between National Power of the UK and a local company, is due on
stream by 1995.
Analysts point out that Tenaga has good prospects - if present difficulties
can be overcome and if the government does not decide to drastically limit
the scope of its activities. Tenaga made pre-tax profits of MDollars 1.41bn
in the year ended August, 1992, up from MDollars 702m previously. It has
gained not only from the massive infusion of funds from its partial
privatisation in May last year but also from the appreciation of the
Malaysian dollar against the US dollar, which has resulted in a reduction in
the company's dollar loan portfolio.
Tenaga has entered into several projects with UK companies; it is likely to
benefit substantially from the fall in the value of sterling, particularly
in the purchase of high cost electricity generating equipment.
Tenaga is confident that once the present problems are overcome, medium and
long term prospects are bright. 'Tenaga is a good investment in the long
term,' says Dr Ani Arope, Tenaga's executive chairman. 'In a rapidly
industrialising economy like Malaysia's it is even more attractive because
electricity demand has not peaked and will continue to pace the GDP growth
for many years ahead.'
But public and government patience is wearing thin. 'The power crisis is a
priority for the government,' says Mrs Aziz. 'If Tenaga cannot meet demand,
then the private sector will have to come in. Tenaga will have no more
monopoly of electricity supply.'

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Placer Dome benefits from output

<TEXT>
PLACER Dome, the Van-couver-based gold producer, more than countered a lower
gold price last year with productivity improvements at its mines in north
America and rising output from low-cost properties in Papua New Guinea and
Chile.
Net earnings from continuing operations were USDollars 111m, or 47 cents a
share, compared to a Dollars 242m loss, or Dollars 1.02 a share, in 1991.
The 1991 loss was due to hefty writedowns totalling Dollars 344m on various
mining assets, notably the Mt Milligan property in British Columbia.
Revenues rose to Dollars 1.09bn from Dollars 1.02bn. Long-term debt was cut
to Dollars 69m at the end of 1992 from Dollars 250m a year earlier. Cash and
short-term investments currently total Dollars 477m.
Placer's share of gold output at its mines totalled 1.95m ounces, up from
1.68m ounces in 1991. Average cash production costs fell by 17 per cent to
Dollars 186 per ounce, offsetting a 7 per cent drop in the average price
received.
Placer has interests in 17 mines in north and south America and Australasia.
The biggest producer last year was its 30 per cent-owned Porgera mine in
Papua New Guines, where Placer's share of the output totalled 445,500 oz at
a cash cost of Dollars 92 an oz. Porgera also accounted for the biggest
increase in output in 1991.
The company announced that Mr Robert Franklin is replacing Mr Fraser Fell as
non-executive chairman.

METALL Mining, the Canadian mining arm of Germany's Metallgesellschaft
group, is buying out the 49.6 per cent minority holding in Minnova, a
Canadian exploration and development company, in a deal worth CDollars 115m
(USDollars 90.8m).
Metall will offer one of its own shares and CDollars 4 cash for each Minnova
share it does not own. At Monday's market price for Metall, the offer is
worth about CDollars 16.12 per Minnova share, representing a premium of
about CDollars 2 over the market price of Minnova shares. Metall also
assumes CDollars 65m of Minnova convertible debentures.
Metall bought 50.4 per cent of Minnova from Noranda for CDollars 131m in
October.

<TEXT>
COCA-Cola Enterprises, the world's largest bottler of Coca-Cola products,
reported an increase in operating income in the fourth quarter, although
special charges and other considerations led to a per share loss.
Operating profit, excluding required accounting charges, rose to Dollars
181m, up from an adjusted Dollars 121m a year earlier. For the year the
operating profit came to Dollars 725m excluding one-time special charges, up
from Dollars 667m. Fourth quarter sales were Dollars 1.3bn, up from Dollars
1.2bn. For the year, sales were barely changed at Dollars 5.1bn, compared
with Dollars 5bn.
The bottler, 44 per cent owned by the Coca-Cola Company, underwent extensive
restructuring in 1992, trimming administrative staff and decentralising
operations. It said the weak US economy and unusually cool, wet weather, cut
soft drink demand.
Mr Summerfield Johnston, chief executive, said: 'We view a 9 per cent
increase in cash operating profit as tangible evidence of the company's
progress.'

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cummins forges diesel engine
link with Komatsu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUMMINS ENGINE of the US and Komatsu, Japan's biggest construction equipment
group, yesterday announced agreement in principle to establish a
co-operative business relationship in diesel engines.
The deal is one of the most important recent link-ups in the diesel
industry, and represents the first significant co-operation between a
western diesel engine producer and an integrated Japanese user and producer
of engines.
The announcement raised questions among observers on which company would be
gaining most from the arrangement, and which of Cummins' plants would be
affected.
But Mr Henry Schacht, Cummins' chairman and chief executive, said the deal
was both mutually beneficial and a 'logical extension of the pressures being
exerted on diesel engine producers and end-users.' It was a deal, he
indicated, that would not have been contemplated 15 years ago.
The diesel engine industry has been spending heavily to produce engines that
comply with increasingly tough emissions regulations.
The two companies said yesterday they would 'apply their technological
expertise to the joint development of high-quality engines able to meet the
standards of tomorrow's diesel engine industry'.
Cummins and Komatsu have had links since the 1960s. The Japanese company was
a Cummins licensee before it developed its own engines in the 1980s, while
Cummins already supplies engines to Komatsu in the US, Latin America and
part of the Japanese company's European production at Birtley in the UK.
But the latest relationship, which has been under discussion for several
years, goes much deeper. The companies plan to review their product lines,
eliminating areas of redundant investment and reducing costs by unifying
certain engine models and promoting combined production.
As a first step, the two companies are considering producing Cummins' small
B series engines in Japan, to be installed in Komatsu equipment or sold by
Cummins in its regional markets.
They are also considering producing a large Komatsu engine at an unnamed
Cummins facility with distribution planned through the Cummins network. In
the UK, Cummins' Daventry plant would appear to have the best chance of
getting the work.
Mr Schacht said both companies would benefit by being freed from the need to
develop these engines. For Cummins, the deal offers increased volumes to
support its technical spending and local production in Japan, while Komatsu
gets access to Cummins' diesel engine expertise.
Mr Allan Rawnsley, a UK-based consultant, said Cummins had spent heavily to
comply with emissions regulations. The deal with Komatsu was a low-cost
route to replacing the ageing 28-litre Vee-form engines, currently made only
in India.
The two companies said the new relationship would lead to joint ventures in
Japan and the US. They hope to reach a definitive agreement later this year.

half

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EDPER Enterprises and Pagurian, two leading holding companies in the
business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, have cut their
quarterly common share dividends in half.
The cuts reflect a thinning stream of dividend income and shrinking cash
resources in the upper layers of the Bronfman group.
Several operating companies, most notably in the property and financial
services sectors, have reduced their common dividends in the past year.
Bramalea, a property developer, has halted preferred dividends.
Edper, which is Mr Peter Bronfman's top public company, is reducing its
dividend to 20 cents a share from 40 cents. Pagurian, the main vehicle for
the Bronfmans' senior managers to participate as shareholders in the group,
has cut its dividend to 7.5 cents from 15 cents.
Mr Edward Bronfman, brother of Mr Peter Bronfman, has a minority interest of
19 per cent in Edper.
The top Bronfman companies have also lost an important source of dividend
income with last week's sale of the group's 38 per cent stake in John
Labatt, the brewer. Labatt has recently contributed about CDollars 32m
(Dollars 25.3m) a year to Brascan, its immediate holding company.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Den norske Bank cuts loss by 50%
to NKr3.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
DEN NORSKE BANK, Norway's biggest bank, yesterday announced a reduction in
net losses of almost 50 per cent to NKr3.07bn (Dollars 450.2m) from NKr6bn a
year earlier, and warned of heavy job cuts later this year.
Mr Ole Lund, DnB's chairman, said that although losses had been cut he
considered the bank's result unsatisfactory. DnB's improved operational
performance was helped by substantial foreign exchange gains which doubled
to NKr1.03bn last year from NKr551m in 1991. However, net interest income
fell to NKr4.675bn from NKr4.810bn.
Group operating income increased to NKr2.69bn from NKr2.1bn while credit
losses fell to NKr4.85bn from NKr6.780bn.
DnB was forced to charge 1992 accounts with a NKr815m loss on assets
compared with a charge of NKr631m in 1991. The bank explained the write-off
was mainly due to loss provisions for Scandinavian Banking Partners, a
consortium in which it participates with Sweden's Skandinaviska Enskilda
Banken and Union Bank of Finland.
The group reduced net operating losses to NKr3.058bn from NKr5.842bn in
1991. DnB said that non-performing loans had increased to NKr11.36bn from
NKr10.2bn during the course of 1992, and that by the end of the year it had
repossessed property valued at NKr2.74bn and spent nearly NKr2bn on finance
and operations costs for non-performing assets. 'Although loan loss
provisions are on the way down, the road to recovery is still long for the
Norwegian corporate customer sector,' said Mr Finn Hvistendahl, chief
executive. According to a survey undertaken for the bank, an estimated 41.3
per cent of Norway's 88,199 companies, or some 36,400, suffered an operating
loss or broke even in 1992.
An estimated 17.4 per cent operate with zero or negative equity capital, the
survey revealed.
DnB's figures were weakened significantly by the UK operations, which
increased net losses more than three-fold to NKr785m from NKr207m as credit
losses nearly doubled to NKr617m from NKr325m.
DnB said its shipping business operated at about break-even in 1992, but
credit losses by the sector rose sharply to NKr392m from NKr179m in 1991.
Prior to last year, the bank's shipping operations had generated annual
operating income of an estimated NKr500m. Group operating expenses were
reduced by NKr566m to NKr4.763bn in 1992 and assets were pared back to
NKr187.9bn from NKr195.8bn in 1991.

OCE-VAN DER Grinten, the Dutch copier and office systems maker, said net
profit for the full year 1992 fell 14 per cent due to the weak economic
climate and unfavourable currency exchange rates, AP-DJ reports from
Amsterdam.
The company said net profit for the year slipped to Fl 87.3m (Dollars 48m)
from Fl 100.9m a year earlier.
The company said it was pressured by greater competition, lower margins, and
a strong guilder.
Meanwhile, net profit per share fell 16 per cent to Fl 5.49m a share from Fl
6.58 a year ago.
Oce said a dividend totalling Fl 2.25 per ordinary share, unchanged from
1991, would be paid.
Sales increased 3 per cent to Fl 2.66bn from Fl 2.58bn. This growth was due
in part to a broader range of goods, which Oce had been building up over
previous years to broaden its market share.
Oce noted that weakness in the US market had an unfavorable impact on Oce
Office Systems, its US division.
Although interest income from leasing activities rose 52 per cent, to Fl
72.9m from Fl 47.8m, that increase was in part offset by higher financing
costs, which rose 6 per cent to Fl 82.8m from Fl 76.5m.
*****
BP Oil Espana, the Spanish unit of the oil company British Petroleum, has
agreed to sell 30 per cent of Productos Quimicos del Mediterraneo SA
(Proquimed), its chemical subsidiary to Ube Industries, the Japanese
industrial group, AP-DJ reports from Madrid.
The sale will take place this year. No financial details were given.
Proquimed is Spain's sole producer of the chemical caprolactam, used in
making synthetic fibers.
Ube Industries is a world leader in caprolactam production, BP Oil Espana
said. It acquired Proquimed in 1991.
*****
Allianz, the German insurer, said its expansion plans would be focused on
east and south-east Asia in geographic terms and on lifting its position in
industrial insurance, Reuter reports from Munich.
'We want to expand our basis in Asia,' Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, the
managing board chairman, said. Allianz has subsidiaries in Japan, Singapore,
Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand. 'But that is not enough,' he said.
*****
Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, has bought 30 per cent of
the shares in Indelec, a Spanish mobile phones and transmission equipment
maker, Reuter reports from Stockholm. No financial details were disclosed.
Telefonica de Espana, the Spanish state telephone company which owns 30 per
cent of Indelec, will have to sell its stake by 1995 to comply with European
Community rules.
Ericsson would then probably be able to increase its stake, according to
Ericsson.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: French chemicals group takes
control of Lorex
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYNTHELABO, the French pharmaceuticals company that belongs to the L'Oreal
cosmetics group, is expanding its interests in the UK by taking full control
of Lorex Pharmaceuticals.
Lorex, which was formed in 1983 to market Synthelabo's products in the UK,
specialises in the development of cardiovascular and central nervous system
drugs. Until now it has operated as a joint venture between Synthelabo, with
51 per cent holding, and Searle, the US drugs company which owns 49 per cent
of the shares.
Synthelabo is buying Searle's interest for an undisclosed sum and will run
Lorex with Delalande, the French laboratory that it bought in late 1991. The
Delalande acquisition followed six weeks after the purchase of Delagrange,
another French laboratory. The two deals formed part of the expansion
strategy pursued by Synthelabo under L'Oreal ownership.
L'Oreal has been expanding Synthelabo in order to reduce its reliance on its
traditional cosmetics interests and to add to its expertise in research,
which plays an increasingly important part in product development within the
cosmetics market.
Synthelabo was one of the contributors to L'Oreal's strong performance last
year.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Huhtamaki improves 63% to FM399m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG demand and the benefits of rationalisation led to a 63 per cent
increase in 1992 profits at Huhtamaki, the Finnish confectionery,
pharmaceutical and packaging group.
The group increased its profit after financial items to FM399m (Dollars
73.8m) from FM245m, as operating earnings climbed 41 per cent to FM561m and
net sales rose 9 per cent to FM6.58bn from FM6.03bn. The dividend is being
increased to FM3.20 per share from FM2.70, reflecting a 72 per cent growth
in earnings per share to FM11.07.
A further increase in pre-tax profits is anticipated in 1993 with sales
expected to exceed FM7bn.
Mr Timo Peltola, chief executive, said: 'Huhtamaki's profitability has
improved to a new level earlier than envisaged. Key products enjoyed a
strong demand despite tight market conditions, while consolidation and
rationalisation programmes boosted profitability in each business sector
above targeted levels.'
Finland accounts for less than 20 per cent of Huhtamaki's sales, so the
group was a beneficiary of the sharp weakening of the markka during 1992.
The Leaf group, one of the world's top 10 confectionary producers, saw
operating profits rise 31 per cent to FM312m as net sales climbed 18 per
cent to FM3.86bn.
The Leiras pharmaceutical unit lifted operating earnings by 77 per cent to
FM148m on a 10 per cent increase in net sales to FM744m.
The Finnish banking sector's combined credit losses will be about FM20bn
this year compared with about FM21bn in 1992, the Finance Ministry said in
an economic forecast, Reuter reports from Helsinki.
'The number of bankruptcies will stay very high and banks' credit losses (in
1993) are likely to remain at last year's level or about 20bn markka,' the
forecast said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDIA, the leading Swedish insurance group, is suspending its dividend for
the first time, after a fall in its net asset value for the third successive
year.
The group said yesterday that its net asset value at December 31, 1992 was
estimated at SKr11.5bn (Dollars 1.6bn), down 20 per cent from SKr14.4bn the
previous year, and down nearly 42 per cent from SKr19.7bn in 1989.
Skandia has paid a dividend every year since it was founded in 1855, with
the 1991 payout totalling SKr4 per share.
The company yesterday declined to comment on its dividend policy.
The group's shares fell SKr8 to SKr109 yesterday.
Skandia said a sharp fall in the value of its Swedish and foreign real
estate portfolios was one of the main reasons for the decline in net asset
value last year.
It blamed losses associated with its 48 per cent stake in Svenska Kredit and
its 26 per cent holding in International Credit, two credit insurance
operations which collapsed during 1992.
A final factor was the impact of hurricane Andrew in the US, which pushed up
claims costs and led to a sharp deterioration in the group's international
insurance result.
Mr Bjorn Wolrath, the chief executive, said the group would continue with
its reorganisation strategy, which has seen it disclose plans to halve its
international non-life reinsurance operations over two years.
He said it planned a further concentration of its international business
operations, but did not elaborate.
'The reorganisation which we are now in the process of implementing, coupled
with falling interest rates makes me believe that we have the possibility to
achieve growth once again in the net asset value of the shareholder
operations in 1993,' Mr Wolrath said.
He added that the group's Nordic operations were continuing to perform well
and lower interest rates and rising share prices were improving the returns
of the Swedish Skandia Life activities.
Skandia will announce its preliminary result on March 18. In the first half
of 1992, the group's management operating result was a SKr636m loss.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Deficit at Finnish paper unit
reduced to FM190m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENSO-GUTZEIT, the Finnish pulp and paper group, cut its 1992 loss after
financial items to FM190m (Dollars 35.1m) from FM950m a year earlier as net
sales rose 10 per cent to FM10.24bn.
'Increase in sales volume and higher export revenue as a result of the
devalued Finnish markka were the main reasons behind the growth,' said Mr
Jukka Harmala, Enso chief executive.
The group benefited from lower wood prices and from increased productivity
at its mills and within central administration.
However, the group's recovery was held up by lower prices for many products
in the face of continuing industry overcapacity. Its deficit was exacerbated
by FM80m in exchange rate losses for financing items.
The group's operating profit was FM1.63bn, or 15.9 per cent of net sales.
Asset sales produced extraordinary profits of FM550m, leaving the group with
a profit of FM360m before adjustments and taxes, compared with a FM515m loss
in 1991.
The group said FM300m in exchange rate losses on foreign currency loans
connected to the unfinished Enocell pulp mill project had been entered
against the project.

FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Framatome earnings fall to
FFr900m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FRAMATOME, the state-controlled French nuclear reactor group, yesterday
reported a fall in net profits to just over FFr900m (Dollars 164.6m) last
year from FFr980m in 1991 because of the continuing contraction of the
nuclear reactor market.
Mr Jean-Claude Leny, chairman, told Les Echos, the French financial
newspaper, that, in spite of the fall in profits, Framatome had performed
better than expected last year. The group experienced a sharp fall in sales
to FFr12.5bn in 1992 from FFr14.2bn in 1991.
Framatome received a substantial nuclear order, its first for some time, at
the start of this year and late last month won a Dollars 120m steam
generator replacement contract from Asco of Spain for its Framatome-Siemens
consortium.
However, Mr Leny warned that 1993 would be more difficult than 1992 because
of the continuing economic pressures.
He said he did not envisage a recovery until 1994.
Mr Leny was concerned that Framatome's position in China, one of the few
buoyant markets for nuclear reactors, could be imperiled by the row between
France and China over the sale late last year of 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter
jets to Taiwan by Dassault, the French state-controlled aircraft maker.
The Framatome chairman told Les Echos that French companies 'have not yet
stopped paying' for the damage to Sino-French relations. However, there were
signs this week of an improvement when Alcatel, the telecommunications
equipment division of Alcatel-Alsthom, the state-controlled industrial group
that owns 44 per cent of Framatome, won Dollars 400m of contracts in China.
Alcatal Alsthom saw net sales rise to FFr161.65bn in 1992 from FFr160.08bn
in 1991. The group said it had suffered from the strengthening of the franc
after the autumn currency crisis.
The level of orders was virtually stable at FFr166bn last year, against
FFr165.3bn in 1991.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Attributable profits of Temple Bar Investment Trust fell from Pounds 8.23m
to Pounds 7.82m over 1992, equal to basic earnings of 13.57p per share,
against 14.29p.
The final dividend, however, is lifted to 8.75p, making a 13.25p (13p)
total.
Net asset value per share net of prior charges at nominal value improved
from 269.81p to 310.9p.
Net of prior charges at market value the figure rose from 270.88p to
310.76p.
The board was more confident about 1993 and said it seemed likely that the
year would see a modest return to economic growth in the UK.
However, directors added that the recovery was 'unlikely to be without
setbacks' and 'it would be wise to caution against excessive optimism'.

<TEXT>
GREENWICH Resources, the Worcestershire-based gold mining company, reported
a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 697,000 for the 12 months to September 30 1992,
against a profit of Pounds 108,000.
The result was struck after an exceptional Pounds 337,000 cost resulting
from the financial restructuring of the Australian subsidiary, United
Goldfields, and redundancy costs.
The operating loss amounted to Pounds 749,000 (Pounds 28,000). Losses per
share rose from 0.2p to 1p.
In spite of the sharp reversal, Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the year had
been a positive one for the group.
Highlights included the award of the Konos Concession in Greece and the
completion of a joint venture agreement with Newcrest Mining to explore and
exploit it.
He added that during the last 18 months the group had been restructured and
overheads had been significantly reduced.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Pittencrieff shares rise 8% on demerger
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Pittencrieff defied the general market decline yesterday with an 8
per cent jump to 351p as the group finally confirmed plans to demerge the
telecommunications division from its oil and gas activities.
The company accompanied the announcement with a forecast increase in its
annual dividend of at least 17 per cent to 7p. The share rise came despite a
placing yesterday of about 2m shares at 312p to pay for purchases.
Pittencrieff intends raising about Dollars 50m (Pounds 35m) by floating a
minority stake in the mobile communications subsidiary in the US through a
public offer. In just two years the offshoot has been built up into an
operation with turnover of Dollars 2m a month.
Mr Doug Sinclair, finance director, said the group had decided to float the
business rather than call continuously on existing shareholders for cash to
fund such rapid growth.
He added that there was a greater understanding in North America of
Pittencrieff's particular communications sector, making the US a sensible
place to float.
The proceeds would be used to repay part of telecommunications' loans to
Pittencrieff and for further expansion. The repayments and expected
dividends would fund expansion in the on-going oil and gas business.
Ms Liz Butler, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the decision to float the
communications business in the US was a good move. 'If the US goes well, it
will underpin the UK shares.'
Pittencrieff is acquiring a communications business in El Paso, Texas, for
Dollars 6.65m and oil and gas reserves, also in Texas, for Dollars 3.75m.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Merry Hill centre sale realises Pounds 128m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS OF Mountleigh, the property company that failed last May, have
agreed to sell Merry Hill, a Midlands shopping centre and the group's
largest UK asset, for Pounds 128m to Chelsfield, the property company headed
by Mr Elliot Bernerd.
Chelsfield, which is acting in partnership with one of its associated
shareholders, expects to complete the deal in about 10 weeks time. The price
includes some tax benefits that stem from enterprise zone allowances.
Mr Stephen James of KPMG Peat Marwick, the joint receiver, said he was
'extremely satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations.' Before
Mountleigh went into receivership, it had failed in an attempt to sell the
shopping centre for Pounds 115m, he said.
'We were in no hurry to sell,' he said. 'This proves that a distressed
seller is someone seeking to avoid going into receivership, not one that has
gone into receivership.'
The deal attracted interest from half a dozen potential buyers, including
O'Connor Group, the US fund which came close to buying the shopping centre a
year ago.
Mr Bernerd said he was a 'cautious enthusiast' about UK property. He drew
encouragement from the surge in overseas investment in good quality property
that followed the devaluation of sterling last September.
Mr James said it would be over-optimistic to claim that the market was
recovering, although more buyers were emerging. 'We are seeing a greater
ability to sell things, but not prices moving up,'
The receivers described Merry Hill as one of the most successful shopping
centres in the UK. The centre, which has more than 260 shops and is served
by a monorail transport system, is 98 per cent let. The centre was built by
Don and Roy Richardson, the Dudley-based property entrepreneurs.
The sale of Merry Hill was complicated by concern that the centre, which is
built on a former steel works, would be placed on the contaminated land
register that is planned by the government. The receivers responded to these
concerns by commissioning a study which showed that no remedial action would
be needed to comply with current or likely environment legislation.
Mountleigh's receivers have realised about Pounds 200m from the sale of 20
of its 83 properties.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: St Modwen increases dividend despite fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST MODWEN Properties, the Birmingham-based group with development and
investment interests around the UK but outside central London, is increasing
its dividend in spite of a 19 per cent fall in annual profits.
Pre-tax profits for the year to November 30 were Pounds 1.71m, compared with
Pounds 2.11m, on turnover down from Pounds 45.1m to Pounds 18.5m. The
directors stated that in 1991 property development sales were abnormally
high because of the sale of an office park in Manchester.
Mr Stan Clarke, chairman, said he believed that 'property values have
generally bottomed out in the regions where the company operates, and I am
cautiously optimistic that during 1993 there will be some recovery.'
This belief, combined with the fact that the group was now earning enough
from the increased rent roll from its investment properties - Pounds 7.5m
last year compared with Pounds 6.9m in 1991 - both to cover its interest
rate bill and company overheads, led to the increase in the dividend.
The distribution is lifted to 0.6p (0.55p). Earnings per share were 1.1p
against 1.7p.
Valuation of property holdings led to a 9 per cent reduction to 35p in net
assets per share.
The lower value of its properties, coupled with a slight increase in
borrowing because of property acquisitions, pushed gearing over the last
financial year up from 88 per cent to 99 per cent.
St Modwen has sought in recent years to concentrate on property investment
and undertake development only where sales or leasing are assured
beforehand.
Mr Paul Doona, finance director, said: 'We are now in a position where we
make a profit without a need to rely on a development contribution.'

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: McErlain to step down as chairman of Anglo
United
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID McErlain is to step down as chairman of Anglo United, owner of the
Coalite smokeless fuel business, after its banks agreed yesterday to a
financial restructuring, including a debt-for-equity swap, which will leave
shareholders with just over 50 per cent of the company.
Mr McErlain said he had 'warned the banks' that receivership would be
preferable to a restructuring which left shareholders with little of the
enlarged equity.
However, the shareholders' stake could still fall to as low as 36 per cent
depending on the rate of take up of warrants and of banks' conversion of
loan notes into shares.
His restructuring plan was backed by the banks but he has had to relinquish
the top job. Mr Harold Cottam, chairman of Haden MacLellan Holdings, the
engineering group, takes over next month.
Anglo recently faced a Pounds 16.3m interest bill and Pounds 7m outstanding
from this year's debt repayment, when operating profits fell from Pounds
13.4m to Pounds 4.68m for the half year to September 30 1992.
Following the highly leveraged bid by Mr McErlain for Coalite in August
1989, the group's total debt was Pounds 467m. Disposals and the proceeds of
a rights issues reduced borrowings to Pounds 211m by March 31 1992.
However, debt recently rose to Pounds 250m as the group failed to make
further divestments, precipitating the present problems.
The group warned that its trading performance continues to be 'hampered' by
the recession.
The main features of the restructuring are: the swap of Pounds 45.9m debt
for 459.3m new shares at 10p (placed with the banks, subject to open offer);
conversion of Pounds 74.9m debt into deep discount notes and convertible
loan notes; and the rescheduling of the remaining Pounds 130.5m of bank
debt.
The rescheduled debt is repayable in two instalments: Pounds 10m on
September 30 1994 and Pounds 120.5m on March 31 1995.
The convertible loan notes can be converted over the next 10 years at 10p a
share. Interest at an equivalent 10 per cent is being deferred until
conversion, while the deep discount loan notes will have a 12 per cent
yield, payable on redemption at their maturity date.
The effect will be to defer interest on Pounds 50m of debt converted into
deep discount loan notes.
Existing shareholders are being offered warrants on the basis of 1-for-3,
which can be exercised at 10p. Anglo's share price yesterday rose 1p to 6
1/2 p.
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Samuel Montagu will end up
with more than 40 per cent of the enlarged group.
The outstanding preference shares are being converted into new ordinary
shares at the enhanced conversion rate of 12.4 new shares for each
preference share.
Following the restructuring, they will end up with 14 per cent of the
enlarged share capital.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: AH Ball shares drop 30p after warning on
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN AH Ball Group fell by 30p to 75p yesterday after the civil
engineer issued a warning on trading results for the year.
Mr Tom Austin, chairman, said that as a result of deteriorating trading
conditions during the six months to March 31, the optimism expressed in the
interim report had proved unfounded.
Order awards had been delayed or cancelled and the group had experienced a
serious decline in the volume of work being executed within the AH Ball &amp; Co
period schedule maintenance contracts.
That, linked with an expected 3 per cent fall in gross margins and reduced
interest receivable, was likely to result in the outcome for the whole of
the current year showing little or no improvement on the Pounds 407,000
achieved in the six months to September 30 1992.
In the last full year pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 960,000.
Mr Austin added that trading conditions for the coming year remained
uncertain, although tendering levels for specific contracts were currently
higher than in recent years. From December 1992 to February 1993 the group
had received about Pounds 3m of new orders, of which about Pounds 1m related
to KD Process International, the maker of process control systems for the
water industry which AH Ball acquired last July.
Cash balances at March 31 were expected to remain satisfactory. However, Mr
Austin said the directors anticipated cutting the final dividend to 3.3p
(4.8p).
The group transferred from the USM last August.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Lost duty free contract hits outcome at
Allders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLDERS, the department store and duty and tax free shops group, suffered a
fall from Pounds 22.6m to Pounds 15.2m in pre-interest profits for the year
to September 30.
Its annual report shows turnover fell 2.3 per cent to Pounds 555.6m, with
sales in the department stores down by 2.1 per cent to Pounds 259.1m and by
2.4 per cent in the duty and tax free shops to Pounds 296.5m.
Mr Tony Collyer, finance director, said that the loss of an important duty
free contract at Sydney airport had hit profits, but he said the group had
won a number of other licences.
The group, which was the subject of a management buy-out from Hanson in
1989, is looking to float at some point, although probably not in the
current year.
The department store side had been affected by the opening of two shops, the
first new stores since 1985, and closure of one.
The group also launched an out-of-town format, At Home with Allders, at five
sites. Mr Collyer said they were expected to generate sales in a full year
equal to one department store, but at a fraction of the cost.
During the year capital expenditure totalled Pounds 20m, he said. The high
level of debt from the buy-out had not stopped the group investing,
especially as a refinancing in 1991 had deferred repayments of the debt.
The group had net debt of about Pounds 90m at the year-end and the interest
charge was Pounds 10.6m, down from Pounds 16.2m, thanks to lower interest
rates and the effect of a refinancing.
However, exceptional debits took Pounds 8.1m, compared to a credit of Pounds
36.8m from the refinancing, leaving a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.4m, against a
Pounds 43.2m profit.
The exceptional item related to unusually large pre-opening costs of Pounds
3.7m on two new department stores, a Pounds 1.7m provision for rent on two
unused properties - a closed department store, where the site is now being
redeveloped, and a warehouse now sold - and a Pounds 2.7m adjustment to the
value of the closed store.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Mrs Fields' shareholders left with just the
crumbs / A look at the background to the financial restructuring of the US
cookie maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUMBLE all-American chocolate chip cookie does not travel well, as UK
investors have found out to their expense.
This week's news of a financial restructuring at Mrs Fields, the
controversial USM-quoted cookie company, leaves 1,700 UK investors with
nothing more than a nominal holding in a private company owned and managed
by US banks.
Shareholders have also been told that they can expect no dividend until the
banks have been repaid. Just when that might be is still somewhat of an open
question, even for the banks concerned.
Most of those left holding what one shareholder called 'virtually worthless
paper' are private individuals, with only three large UK institutions on the
register.
Ignoring the warning bells of a disastrous flotation in the spring of 1986,
they rushed to buy in the following year amid the hype of one product wonder
stocks such as Sock Shop and Tie Rack.
The company's ability to meet the forecast on which it was floated was taken
as a good sign. Its shares rose from a low of 105p to 272p in June 1987,
against a flotation price of 140p.
Within months, however, cracks in the company's strategy began to appear. An
ambitious expansion programme was reversed as rents soared, branches
languished and the economy took a nosedive. Little more than four years
after its market debut, Mrs Fields was forced to sit down with bankers to
hammer out a survival strategy.
This week it became clear that the company has been all but bankrupt for
some time, in spite of a shift toward less capital intensive franchising and
licensing operations. One significant UK shareholder said it had written the
investment off in 1990, a year before the shares were suspended at 10p.
The agreement announced on Monday has taken two years to negotiate. Mrs
Fields, the high profile founder of the company, and her husband, Randall,
had already pledged most of their 80 per cent stake to the banks to keep the
business afloat. But the banks will return control of an 8.4 per cent stake
to her over the next three years as long as she remains with the company.
Mrs Fields will remain as chairwoman, albeit on a slightly reduced salary of
Dollars 450,000 a year. The banks have decided apparently that to lose her
face from marketing campaigns would be like losing Anita Roddick from the
Body Shop, said one observer.
This logic was also behind the decision to cancel 'interaffiliate' debts of
Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 10.2m) - basically monies owed by companies controlled
by the Fields. Her husband, who resigned as chairman in March 1991, has also
had his compensation package reduced.
For shareholders, there is little solace in the terms agreed by the banks.
After the refinancing, the group will still have debt of Dollars 50m with a
Dollars 64.5m deficit in shareholders funds. It is certain to be some time
before even the banks can begin to think of getting a return.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Pentland pays Pounds 7m for outdoor
clothing company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENTLAND, the cash-rich sporting and consumer goods company, has paid Pounds
7m for Berghaus, the outdoor clothing and equipment group.
The acquisition was Pent-land's first since it pulled out of talks last
October to buy Adidas, the sports-shoe maker. Pentland has about Pounds 350m
net cash and further small to medium-sized acquisitions are expected.
Berghaus, which operates from two factories near Newcastle upon Tyne, is the
UK market leader for specialist mountaineering and hiking clothing and last
year reported sales of about Pounds 20m. Its products are expensive, with
some jackets retailing at more than Pounds 350.
Mr Frank Farrant, Pent-land's finance director, said Berghaus' brand name
would be developed and popularised. 'We intend to make it more accessible to
the general outdoor enthusiast without detracting from the brand.'
The Newcastle factories, which employ about 500 people, will be retained
while Pent-land hopes to use its sourcing experience in the Far East to
lower costs. Pentland, which owns the Speedo swimwear brand, also acts as
sourcing agent in the Far East for LA Gear, the US sports shoe maker.
Mr Peter Lockey and Mr Gordon Davison, who founded Berghaus about 20 years
ago, are leaving the company, although Mr Davison will remain as a
consultant.
Mr Farrant said: 'They think they've taken it as far as they can. The next
stage will take more money and a more structured organisation behind it'.
The purchase price includes Pounds 3m of bank borrowings. Berg-haus has net
assets of Pounds 2m. The company is profitable after interest costs and
should slightly enhance Pentland's earnings. Mr Farrant said he hoped
Berghaus' operating profit margin, currently about 5 per cent, would improve
towards 10 per cent as turnover grew.
The company's main market is the UK, although it has subsidiaries in Germany
and Italy and is hopeful about growth from Scandinavia.
Pentland, which earned its cash holdings from an investment in Reebok, the
US sports shoe maker, is understood to be looking at several other potential
acquisitions, both in the US and UK. But none of the potential targets are
equivalent in size to Adidas, which earlier this week was sold to a
consortium of investors by Mr Bernard Tapie, the French businessman.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Claremont reaches settlement with J&amp;J
Fashions designer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS JENIFER Rosenberg, the clothes designer who built up J&amp;J Fashions before
departing acrimoniously following the company's takeover by Claremont
Garments (Holdings) last year, has reached an out-of-court settlement with
Claremont.
Under the settlement, Mrs Rosenberg will receive a payment of about Pounds
100,000 and be freed from a service agreement signed when Claremont bought
J&amp;J. In return, she will remain bound by certain restrictive covenants
signed as part of the acquisition agreement.
However, the two sides seemed to disagree yesterday about the scope of the
restrictions. For example, advisers to Mrs Rosenberg believed she was able
to design blouses for suppliers to Marks and Spencer, J&amp;J's main customer,
while Claremont's advisers believed she was not. There was further confusion
as to whether she could work as a designer of children's wear and coats.
Claremont, which is also one of Marks and Spencer's main suppliers, paid
Pounds 27m for J&amp;J in June last year. But the relationship with Mrs
Rosenberg turned sour and Claremont terminated her service agreement, which
was due to run for two years, in October.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow Pounds 56m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAYLOR Woodrow yesterday raised Pounds 55.5m through a debenture issue in a
rare move by a construction group to borrow money through bonds secured on a
property portfolio.
The bonds were added to an existing debenture issue, first launched in 1989.
The company raised Pounds 80m at that stage, though it later bought back
Pounds 35m of the bonds to record a Pounds 7.5m profit.
Explaining the decision to issue more of the long-dated bonds, which are due
to mature in October 2014, Mr David Green, finance director, said:
'Historically, these are the lowest long-term interest rates in 25 years. I
doubt very much that they will go very much lower.'
The bonds were issued with a yield of 10.037 per cent.
Institutional investors in the UK, who buy such bonds to match future
pension or insurance liabilities, would be resistant to buying bonds that
yield less than 10 per cent, suggesting that this is a good time to borrow,
said Mr Green.
The money will be used to repay a sterling eurobond.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hanson marginally ahead on 'slow
improvement' in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HANSON, chairman of Hanson, the US-UK conglomerate, said yesterday: 'As
expected the new year has begun with lower operating margins than in the
comparable quarter'. He said there were 'some signs of a slow improvement in
the US, but it is too early to say this for the UK'.
He was reporting results for the first quarter of the current financial
year, which showed pre-tax profits up from Pounds 226m to Pounds 236m,
helped by a Pounds 20m disposal profit. The group does not reveal operating
profits at the first quarter stage, but analysts suspected that interest
receivable was slightly lower and operating profits were down.
Recession is still affecting many of the group's businesses. However, in the
US Cavenham Forest Industries was seeing markedly higher prices for lumber
used in the construction industry. Mr Martin Taylor, vice chairman, said
prices were 30 to 40 per cent higher than six months ago.
This could be a leading indicator of an upturn in construction However, any
increase in demand has yet to work through to Hanson's aggregates business.
Mr Taylor said another good sign was that DuPont, the leading maker of
titanium dioxide, had removed its price discounts on the chemical which
could help Hanson's SCM subsidiary.
In the UK, profits at Imperial Tobacco were higher, he said, but otherwise
there were no signs of 'green shoots'. The group's brick and aggregates
operations were not seeing any upturn in demand yet.
He declined to comment on negotiations in the US between the coal industry
and miners. In the US, 44 per cent of the group's coal mining capacity has
been hit by a strike since the beginning of this month. He said a judgment
on the case against Costain over the sale of Costain's Australian coal
mining business, was expected in the next week or so.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: A revamped package is welcomed in the City
 -The changing face of Bowater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWATER'S acquisition of Specialty Coatings International was welcomed by
the City yesterday and marks the final phase of the revamp of the group
begun in 1987.
The group has come to be seen as a model of how to run a business in a
recession, and it says much for its standing that yesterday's rights issue -
the second in less than a year - was greeted by an 8p rise in the shares to
493p.
The new management which has transformed the company, headed by Mr Norman
Ireland, for 20 years finance director of BTR, the industrial holding group,
decided in 1987 to reduce its traditional interests in the paper and
packaging sectors. It moved instead towards more sophisticated value-added
products, offering bigger profit margins and growth potential.
In 1987 it acquired Rexham Corporation, the US packaging group, and its
portfolio of custom coating and laminates businesses. Two years later it
purchased Release Technologies, the release films and papers manufacturer.
Having studied the potential of these businesses, Bowater adopted a strategy
in 1990 of developing a 'critical mass' in three areas: health care
packaging, personal care packaging, and coated industrial films.
The first two aims were largely achieved through the acquisition last March
of DRG Packaging, which supplies speciality packaging to the food and
healthcare markets, and Cope Allman, a cosmetics and pharmaceuticals
packaging group. The purchases were funded largely by a Pounds 333.5m rights
issue.
SCI, Bowater's latest target, was formerly part of James River, but was
acquired in a leveraged buy-out in 1991 by AEA Investors, a group of New
York investors.
It specialises in precision coating of specialist films and papers, used in
the imaging, graphic and computer industries, through a number of wholly
owned subsidiaries in the US, UK and the Irish Republic. For the year to
December 27 1992, it made operating profits of Dollars 48.6m (Pounds 34.2m)
on sales of Dollars 568m. Net assets, before deducting borrowings of Dollars
125.9m, were valued at Dollars 276.3m.
Its activities can be grouped into four main areas: Graphics Technology
International, which supplies microfilm, phototools, and computer output
media; HP Smith and Smith &amp; McLaurin, which specialise in self-adhesive
label products; Decorative Specialities International, which supplies
latex-saturated paper used in book coverings and other products; and Custom
Paper Group, which makes papers used in filtration and other absorbent
products.
Bowater said yesterday that Custom Paper, although a profitable and
successful business, did not fit with Bowater's core businesses and would
immediately be put up for sale.
Otherwise, Mr David Lyon, Bowater's chief executive, said the acquisition
would increase its annual sales of coated films and papers to Pounds 500m,
or about 25 per cent of the group's annual turnover. It would also broaden
Bowater's existing coating capabilities into new areas with attractive
growth rates.
He added that SCI's skills at finding applications and products for new
processes would complement Bowater's own expertise in research and
development.
Mr Tim Rothwell, packaging industry analyst at brokers BZW, said SCI was an
'excellent' fit for Bowater.
'If you had asked me two years ago what was the most likely business for
Bowater to acquire, this is the one I would have mentioned. It must have
been irresistible for the management even if it involved another rights
issue.'
He said the Dollars 434m price tag, representing only 76 cents for every
Dollars 1 of sales and an earnings multiple of 14.4, was attractive, while
the decision to fund the deal through equity rather than debt was sensible
in order to keep gearing, currently 57 per cent, under control.
The deal is conditional on approval under US anti-trust legislation, hence
the decision to launch the rights issue in two stages. Mr Michael Hartnall,
finance director, said: 'We believe we will get clearance, although it might
take longer than we would hope. AEA investors would not have put this up for
sale and let us go this far if they did not believe it would be approved.'
If the deal falls through, the Pounds 95m first stage of the rights issue
will be used to reduce gearing and take advantage of other acquisition
opportunities.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Ibstock warns of Pounds 27m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBSTOCK JOHNSEN, Britain's third largest brick manufacturer warned yesterday
that it expects to report a Pounds 27m pre-tax loss for 1992 after taking
into account plant closure costs and other provisions.
The company, which plans to close up to four of its nine UK brick plants,
intends to reduce its final dividend to 0.5p making a total of just 1p,
compared with 6p.
In 1991 Ibstock made pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.6m on sales of Pounds
285m. The group's share price yesterday fell 2p to 47p.
Mr Ian Maclellan, group managing director, said provisions for the period
should be about Pounds 28m. All but Pounds 4m of this would be needed to
cover the cost of the reorganisation of its UK brick business.
The group was intending to close smaller works to concentrate production at
larger more economic plants.
About 200 jobs are expected to be lost by the end of this year as UK brick
production capacity is gradually lowered from about 300m to about 250m
bricks a year.
Mr Maclellan said that the closures had been caused by the shrinking of the
UK brick market due to the construction recession.
Ibstock, despite the closures, expected to maintain its UK market share at
about 8 per cent behind the market leaders, Hanson, which owns London Brick
and Butterley, and Redland.
As well as closing smaller plants the group is increasing capacity at its
Laybrook plant in Sussex and its Atlas works near Aldridge in the West
Midlands.
After taking into account write-downs the debt to equity ratio would be less
than 20 per cent, said Mr Maclellan.
More than a fifth of British brick plants have closed since 1988 while
manufacturing capacity of the industry has fallen by almost a quarter
according to the Brick Development Association.
Even so, the industry's potential capacity to make 3.7bn bricks a year
continues to outstrip sales which last year fell to just 2.9bn bricks
compared with more than 4.7bn in 1988. The number of workers employed by the
industry since then has fallen from 14,000 to less than 9,000.
Stocks of unsold bricks in December totalled 1.5bn, enough to build 150,000
homes and equivalent to 30 weeks supply to the construction industry.
Mr Maclellan warned that the industry could expect another year of pain as
stocks gradually were reduced. He said this ought to lead to a better year
in 1994 provided the recent revival in the UK housing market was sustained.

FT  17 FEB 93 / British Airways finds the glory days are over: UK airline
blames sterling's depreciation but fares wars have hit margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The squalid story of intrigue and dirty tricks against Virgin Atlantic has
kept British Airways in the headlines this year. But after reporting an 80
per cent drop in its third quarter pre-tax profits, the emphasis yesterday
shifted to how the world's 'favourite' and most profitable airline is coping
with the current harsh realities of the industry.
Although the fall in profits was not as bad as some City analysts had
anticipated, it raises the possibility that the corporate darling of the
Thatcher years is losing some of its glamour.
Sir Colin Marshall, who took over as chairman from Lord King this month,
blamed much of the fall in profits on the depreciation of sterling. But BA
has not escaped the fierce fares wars that are cutting airline profit
margins, and the down-trading which has seen first and business class
passengers moving down the cabin to cheaper seats.
On the plus side, BA expects the benefits of the weaker pound on its
international revenues to show through in coming months. Sterling's
devaluation had an almost instantaneous negative effect on half the
airline's operating costs, while the foreign revenue benefits will show
through later because most tickets are booked in advance.
The airline continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the
industry; it operates in profit at a time when most of its competitors are
swimming in red ink ('I think the most important thing is that we made a
profit,' Sir Colin said yesterday); it has invested heavily in other
airlines to strengthen its global reach; it continues to cut costs; and it
believes it will be in a strong position to take advantage of the recovery
when it comes.
But for all this, the 1990s are likely to be a fundamentally different
decade for BA compared with the 1980s. BA was among the first airlines to
address the problem of costs and to introduce aggressively the commercial
techniques of retailing. It was also the first to recover from the Gulf war
crisis. But now Lord King has gone and with him perhaps some of the
airline's considerable political influence, which risks being further eroded
by political reaction to the Virgin affair.
BA and Virgin are still trying to come to a settlement and bury the hatchet
for good. The saga has left scars on BA's image and internal morale.
Allegations of a fraud at BA's property maintenance department, which
surfaced last weekend, have not helped clear the atmosphere. 'It suggests
that management controls are not all they are made out to be,' said one
analyst.
Although the airline industry has traditionally lived through 'boom and
bust' cycles, there is no guarantee that the eventual upturn in the current
cycle will be as robust as previous ones. 'A structural change is taking
place in the revenue outlook for the industry,' says Mr Chris Tarry,
aviation analyst at Kleinwort Benson. 'There is likely to be continued
pressure on revenues and fare yields are unlikely to recover fully when the
cycle comes up again.'
BA's competitors, which were slow to react during the last decade, are now
also scrambling to cut costs and stitch up international alliances to
strengthen their market presence.
BA is also absorbing a series of investments in other airlines, including
USAir, Qantas, the former operations of Dan-Air, as well as some smaller
European airline ventures. With Dan-Air, the challenge will be to turn
loss-making activities at London's Gatwick airport into profit. The first
step has been to convert the Gatwick-based European operations into a
lower-cost airline. All these operations have been grouped at the airport's
North terminal and last week BA launched a Pounds 4m marketing campaign to
promote it.
As for the investments in Qantas and USAir, the benefits will not be
immediate and could take as long as one or two years to emerge, according to
some analysts. Moreover, the new Clinton administration, under intense
pressure from the big three US carriers (American Airlines, United Airlines,
and Delta Air Lines), may try to block the USAir deal. The question is
whether BA will be able to take full advantage of the access it will gain
into USAir's domestic network in America without having to give up some
ground at its Heathrow base to other US carriers. 'I can't see BA's
protection under the existing US-UK aviation agreement lasting for ever,'
the head of a large European airline has said.
A further sign of the new competitive pressures facing BA came yesterday
from the airline's current bete noir. Mr Richard Branson said he would step
up his challenge to BA at Heathrow by starting a service to New York's
Newark airport at the end of next month, adding a fourth long-haul
destination out of BA's home base.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Thomson to cut back on UK free newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON Corporation, the Canadian-controlled publishing and travel group, is
severely curtailing its UK free-newspaper business, and selling or closing
about one-seventh of its paid-for titles in North America.
Thomson said yesterday that the planned disposals and closures will result
in a USDollars 170m (Pounds 119m) charge against fourth-quarter 1992
earnings, which are due to be published in mid-March. A third of the
writedown applies to publishing rights, circulation and goodwill at the UK
free-newspaper operations, comprising about 70 weeklies under the Herald &amp;
Post title.
Citing the steep decline in advertising during the recession without the
benefit of circulation revenues, Thomson said yesterday that 'we will be
involved to a much lesser extent in the free newspaper business'.
The company has not yet decided, however, which titles will be sold or
closed. Several may be merged into larger units. The process is expected to
take up to a year. None of Thomson's paid-for UK regional newspapers will be
affected.
Mr Gordon Paul, chief executive of Thomson Regional Newspapers in the UK,
denied there was any fundamental change of direction. But he said: 'I do not
want to pretend we are not going to review our business.'
Thomson also plans to sell or close about 30 of its 217 daily and weekly
papers in the US and Canada. The company refused to identify them, except to
say they are all in small communities.
Thomson shares lost 38 cents to CDollars 14 in early trading on the Toronto
stock exchange.

FT  17 FEB 93 / BA profits fall 80% to Pounds 20m in third quarter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways' pre-tax profits fell 80 per cent to Pounds 20m in the third
quarter compared with Pounds 100m in the same period last year.
The sharp decline was largely caused by the significant depreciation of
sterling following Britain's withdrawal from the European exchange rate
mechanism last September. This alone accounted for more than half of the
Pounds 80m profit fall.
The third quarter performance was at the top end of City expectations.
Analysts had forecast earnings anywhere between a Pounds 20m profit to a
Pounds 20m loss. BA shares closed 3p lower at 276p.
Although passenger traffic on scheduled services rose 7.3 per cent to 6.18m
passengers, the increase fell short of the airline's capacity in the third
quarter.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA chairman, also said traffic growth was concentrated
on lower yielding economy passengers, with demand for high yielding first
and business class tickets below last year's levels.
Passenger yields fell by 4.9 per cent, reflecting fares wars in the airline
industry as well as the continuing trend of passengers trading down from
first and business class to economy class.
However, Sir Colin said that the benefits of the weak pound were beginning
to show through and 'sound progress continues in the cost reduction
programme'. But he also warned that trading conditions remained difficult
and that the fourth quarter was traditionally the weakest of the year.
Group turnover rose by 4.5 per cent to Pounds 1.37bn in the third quarter
compared with Pounds 1.31bn the year before. Operating profits fell 36.9 per
cent to Pounds 70m from Pounds 111m in the third quarter, while after-tax
profits dropped 51.2 per cent to Pounds 40m from Pounds 82m the previous
year. Earnings per share in the quarter were 5.1p on a fully diluted basis,
down 48 per cent.
Pre-tax earnings for the first nine months of the year were 13 per cent
lower at Pounds 247m, compared with Pounds 285m the year before. After-tax
profits for the first nine months totalled Pounds 222m compared with Pounds
234m the year before. Earnings per share were 26.5p on a fully diluted
basis.
After funding capital expenditure, there was a net cash outflow of Pounds
183m in the first nine months compared with a cash inflow of Pounds 399m the
year before. The group wrote off Pounds 48m of the cost of taking over
Dan-Air, the former Gatwick-based airline, against reserves.

FT  17 FEB 93 / GPA hit by chief executive resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nigel Wilson has resigned from GPA Group just over a year after he was
brought in as chief executive-corporate to improve the aircraft leasing
company's relations with shareholders, banks and aircraft manufacturers.
Several of the group's shareholders yesterday described Mr Wilson's
resignation as a blow to the company, which is in the middle of debt
restructuring negotiations. One institutional shareholder said: 'Mr Wilson
had a feel for institutional sentiment which the company sadly lacked. His
departure will be a great loss.'
A spokesman for GPA last night confirmed that Mr Wilson is to leave next
week. He said the decision had been agreed amicably and would not affect the
restructuring proposals.
Mr Wilson's responsibilities will be taken over by other departments. GPA is
expected to announce a management reshuffle within the next 48 hours.
Mr Wilson, the 36-year-old former managing director of Stanhope Properties,
was recruited just before the group aborted its planned flotation. When the
company failed to go public, Mr Wilson become involved in the refinancing
proposals. One banker involved in the negotiations said: 'It is a pity the
company could not persuade Mr Wilson to stay on.'

FT  17 FEB 93 / Hanson rises to Pounds 236m on disposal and currency
movements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, rose in its first
quarter from Pounds 226m to Pounds 236m. However, the figure was boosted by
a Pounds 20m disposal profit and currency movements, and underlying profits
fell 10 per cent.
The biggest surprise in the figures, covering the three months to December
31, was an increase in the tax rate from 17.7 per cent to 27.5 per cent. As
a result, earnings per share in the quarter fell 10.3 per cent to 3.5p.
That, and a downbeat statement from Lord Hanson, chairman, took 4p off the
shares to 250p.
A rise in the tax rate from the unusually low level of 15.3 per cent for
1991-92 had been expected. But the company had said in December the rate
would probably be 26 to 27 per cent. Yesterday analysts revised estimates
for the tax rate up to around 28 per cent for the current financial year, as
well as shading back pre-tax profit forecasts.
Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman, said the higher tax charge was 'almost
entirely down to additional advance corporation tax'. Last year the group
moved to quarterly dividends, and as only two payments were made in the year
instead of four, there was a one-off benefit in reduced ACT. That is now
being reversed.
Analysts surmised that the higher than expected tax rate meant UK profits
were weaker than budgeted, giving less mainstream corporation tax against
which ACT can be offset. The quarterly dividend is also slightly higher at
2.85p compared with 2.75p a year ago, though the same as the last quarterly
dividend announced in December.
Turnover rose 10.2 per cent to Pounds 2.3bn. Pre-tax profits included a
Pounds 20m profit on the sale of Weber Aircraft, for Dollars 75m (then
Pounds 49.5m), announced in October. Excluding these, profits would have
been Pounds 216m. Had the previous year's pre-tax profit been translated at
the end-December exchange rate it would have been Pounds 240m.
Hanson now uses FRS 3. Profits in the comparable quarter included Pounds 11m
from businesses since sold. On the acquisition side there was a full
three-month contribution from Beazer, which was bought on December 4, 1991.
The extra two months had little effect at the pre-tax level.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Bowater to fund US purchase with Pounds 295m rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWATER, the packaging and industrial films group, said yesterday it was
buying Specialty Coatings International, the US coatings company, for
Dollars 434m (Pounds 305m), increasing its strength in the coated films and
papers market.
The deal is being funded by a Pounds 295m one-for-six rights issue -
Bowater's second in less than a year - but was welcomed by the stock market.
Its shares gained 8p to 493p, compared with the issue price of 400p.
Mr David Lyon, chief executive, said the business offered 'real
complementarity. It is a huge strategic gain for us.'
He said the acquisition was expected to enhance earnings this year, and
would increase Bowater's annual sales of coated films and papers to Pounds
500m, or 25 per cent of annual group turnover.
SCI was formerly part of James River, the US paper group, but was acquired
in a leveraged buy-out by a group of New York investors in 1991. It
specialises in precision coatings of specialist films and paper for the
imaging, graphic and computer industries.
The rights issue will be in two stages, as the deal is conditional on US
approval under anti-trust legislation. The unconditional first stage will
raise Pounds 95m, while the second instalment is due to be issued between
March 23 and November 10, depending on US approval.
Bowater raised Pounds 333.5m from a rights issue last March to fund the
acquisition of the packaging businesses DRG Packaging and Cope Allman.
News of yesterday's deal was accompanied by better than expected estimated
results for 1992, showing an unaudited Pounds 147m pre-tax profit - an 48.5
per cent increase on 1991.
Turnover is estimated to have risen from Pounds 1.27bn to Pounds 1.57bn,
while earnings per share, excluding exceptional items, rose from 18.5p to
25.1p. Bowater is forecasting a final dividend of 6.65p, making a total of
11.5p, an increase of 11.1 per cent.
The company said trading in the fourth quarter had been 'rather ahead' of
expectations, and the performance had been maintained in January. Mr Michael
Hartnall, finance director, said it was too early to talk of recovery: 'We
have seen a lot of false dawns.'

FT  17 FEB 93 / Opec cuts output in bid to shore up oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CUT in crude oil production by almost 1m barrels a day in the second
quarter of 1993 was agreed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries last night in a determined attempt to bolster world oil prices.
The cuts will be imposed in full by March 1.
Opec ministers concluded almost four days of talks in Vienna by agreeing to
make pro-rata cuts to a ceiling of 23.85m b/d - a figure which would take
almost 1.5m b/d of oil off the market given that Opec has been producing
well above its first-quarter ceiling.
The organisation hopes the deal will at least support crude prices at
present levels, which had hardened by more than Dollars 1.5 a barrel before
the meeting on expectations of a deal to cut the second-quarter ceiling by
1m b/d.
Markets reacted bearishly to the deal. In New York, US light crude futures
ended 45 cents a barrel lower at Dollars 19.53 a barrel for March delivery.
Industry analysts attending the meeting said that prices would only firm
above present levels if Opec showed unusual discipline.
Opec's president, Mr Alirio Parra of Venezuela, thought it less likely that
members would fail to comply with quotas now, when prices are weak. 'Even
allowing for leakage - and I think everyone believes compliance will be very
important - you will still have a significant adjustment.'
Saudi Arabia, Opec's biggest producer, has sought to convince the markets of
Opec's seriousness by notifying its customers that it will be cutting
production by 400,000 b/d to 8m b/d.
Agreement on the final wording of the communique was delayed by strong
disagreement between Kuwait and other member states about the Gulf state's
desire for special mention.
Kuwait agreed to cut production from its present claimed level of 1.98m b/d
to 1.6m b/d, but argued fiercely that it should be given special treatment
while recovering revenue lost during the Gulf war and while rebuilding its
damaged oil industry.
Kuwait wanted the final communique to acknowledge that its present
production and capacity was temporary and did not reflect either its
eventual output capacity or its historic market share within Opec. Kuwait
had the capacity to pump up to 2.5m b/d before the Iraqi invasion.
Iran and several other delegations opposed making special mention for
Kuwait.
Finally, the ministers agreed to include what one delegate called 'positions
for the future'.
In Kuwait's case, this appears to allow that the Gulf state will in the
third quarter be allocated an output with parity to fellow members of
equivalent capacity and historic market share.
Iraq, which had its quota cut from 500,000 to 400,000 b/d but did not send
its minister to the talks, rejected the deal as 'nonsense'.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Yeltsin in truce talks with rival: Personal battle abandoned
in move to end constitutional crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN president Boris Yelstin and his main political rival appeared to
have temporarily set aside their differences last night as they agreed on a
plan to resolve the country's constitutional crisis.
After a mere half hour's talks in the Kremlin, Mr Yeltsin and Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, the speaker of the Supreme Soviet, agreed to call a special
session of the Congress of People's Deputies to ratify a 'constitutional
agreement' which will be thrashed out over the next 10 days by teams
appointed by the two men.
The agreement signifies that both have decided to abandon their personal
battle of attrition. Instead, opposing experts will haggle over the form of
constitutional government in Russia - the fundamental question between Mr
Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov.
However, the brief statements issued by the presidential press office and
the official Itar Tass news agency after the early evening meeting raise
more questions than they answer, and leave the result of the increasingly
bitter struggle over how Russia is governed still in balance.
The presidential statement said that a range of proposals aimed at getting
agreement between the executive and legislature on the constitutional system
and on alleviating the economic crisis would be published today. These will
include Mr Yeltsin's own version of the constitution.
Over the next 10 days, a joint commission of experts headed by Mr Vladimir
Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, and Mr Nikolai Ryabov, the first
deputy speaker, will attempt to obtain an agreement on a draft constitution
to be presented to the special Congress in early March.
However, the statement from the president's press office stressed that until
the Congress ratified this putative agreement, the government would continue
to prepare for a referendum on the constitution, scheduled for April 11
under a prior agreement between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov made in
December. At the same time, Itar Tass said that both men voiced 'anxiety
over the possible results' of such a referendum.
The newsagency quoted Mr Khasbulatov, during a meeting yesterday with former
US president Richard Nixon, as saying that a danger of dictatorship loomed
and that 'only a strengthening of the principles of parliamentarism can help
us'.
Although Mr Yeltsin, according to the statement, 'came forward with the
initiative of calling an extraordinary Congress', it is precisely that forum
which has been the most bitter critic of his government's actions and of his
policies.
The December Congress forced him to replace Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime
minister with the more conservative Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, and only
grudgingly agreed to a constitutional referendum.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Labour accuses Major of 'abuse' over Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR was accused of 'outright abuse' of Britain's constitution by
Mr John Smith, the Labour party leader, yesterday over the government's
handling of the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
The attack, which followed an embarrassing about-turn by ministers on
Monday, foreshadowed a possible clash between the government and parliament
over Labour's amendment to include the social chapter in the bill.
Labour leaders said they would try to turn the debate on its amendment 27 on
the social chapter into a vote of principle, even though the government said
on Monday that fresh legal advice meant that Maastricht could still be
ratified without changes if the amendment was passed.
Separately, Lord Tebbit, former Tory party chairman and opponent of
Maastricht, stepped up his attacks on the prime minister, saying in a speech
in Hammersmith, London, that Britain's political leaders no longer cared
about the country's independence.
Although the government has removed some of the sting from Labour's
amendment, the spectacle of Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, correcting
the government line set out a few weeks ago by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones,
Europe minister, gave ammunition yesterday to Labour - and Tory opponents of
the bill.
Last night Mr Smith wrote to the prime minister asking for the publication
of the apparently conflicting advice on amendment 27 given by the
government's law officers and by the Foreign Office.
Earlier in the Commons, Mr Smith said the prime minister was 'determined to
use every slippery manoeuvre to avoid parliament deciding this issue. Aren't
you engaged in an outright abuse of our unwritten constitution?'
He asked Mr Major to say whether parliament should be able to decide if the
social chapter should be incorporated.
The prime minister confirmed that MPs who back the social chapter will only
have the choice of accepting the treaty as a whole or not at all. 'It is for
this house to decide by its vote on third reading whether to approve the
European Communities (Amendment) Bill and enable the government to ratify
the treaty.' There were two sorts of amendment, Mr Major said. 'Those that
would render our law incompatible with the treaty and must be defeated, and
others which are undesirable but would not prevent us from ratifying.' The
government sees amendment 27 as in the second category.
But asked by a Labour MP whether he was planning to ignore parliament, Mr
Major replied: 'I can't and I don't'
Euro-sceptic Tory MPs signalled that they may still vote for Labour's
amendment because of possible embarrassment to the government and the faint
prospect that it would scupper ratification of Maastricht. With the Liberal
Democrats still pledged to back Labour and less likely to back down, the
chances of a government defeat have risen since Monday, one Tory rebel said.
Labour has been restricted by Commons procedures over what amendments it can
table. Amendment 27 would in fact remove the Maastricht treaty protocol
including both the social chapter for the other 11 EC members and Britain's
opt-out. Labour believes its amendment could still force the government to
call an EC conference and implement the social chapter.

FT  17 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: British Airways
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's third-quarter results from BA confirmed the extent of the
short-term pressures afflicting the airline. But they also hinted at the
long-term promise for shareholders able to contain their queasiness. The
Pounds 80m drop in the quarter's profits largely resulted from the immediate
impact of the falling pound and customers' continued reluctance to sit at
the dearer end of the cabin.
But sterling's devaluation should now work in BA's favour as 60 per cent of
ticket sales are made overseas while only half its costs are incurred in
harder currencies. Firmer evidence of recovery should prompt a strong rise
in the shares of such a highly cyclical stock. In that event, however, BA
will probably tap the market to ease the financial strains of its global
ambitions.

FT  17 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A healthy scepticism about Hanson's low tax charge has in the end proved
justified. While the reasons for the rise in the tax rate to 28 per cent are
as opaque as the traditionally low charge, Hanson is at least becoming a
more normal company.
The outlook for Hanson's operations remains gloomy. There is little prospect
of robust recovery in UK basic industries - as Ibstock's cut in brickmaking
capacity confirmed yesterday. Meanwhile the fall in base rates will cut
interest income through the year. In the US hopes of a large federal
spending package which would benefit the aggregates business are also
fading. The shares have been buoyed by the company's overseas earnings and
cyclical recovery prospects. That process cannot go too far, however much
investors are comforted by the 5.8 per cent yield.

FT  17 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The slide in US equities following President Bill Clinton's outline
proposals for reducing the budget deficit looks like the response of an
over-valued market. Income tax increases now proposed go far beyond the
millionaires tax promised in campaign rhetoric. Yet that should hardly come
as a surprise. An energy tax and higher corporation tax were also bound to
be unpopular. Still, a package which reduced the deficit by Dollars 145bn
over 4 years might be expected to shave only a fraction of a percentage
point from growth.
Wall Street fears that by raising taxes on the middle class now the
President risks pushing the economy back into recession. The big car makers
were among the hardest hit yesterday on just such sentiment. If higher
corporate taxes also lead companies to rein back investment plans, the
strong earnings recovery now factored into share prices could be cast into
doubt.
With so much already in the price, the equity market can not be blamed for
worrying. The greater danger, though, is that the long process of
horse-trading between the White House and Congress leaves the deficit to
grow unchecked. The Federal Reserve has indicated a deal on the deficit
might leave room for lower interest rates - especially if employment growth
remains sluggish. Without a deal the Fed may be more inclined to send rates
higher. On a prospective yield of less than 3 per cent, US equities would
then look vulnerable indeed.

FT  17 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Bowater
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In recent years Bowater has demonstrated a deft touch in the takeover game.
Its proposed Pounds 305m acquisition of the US-based Speciality Coatings
International appears just the latest in a string of well-conceived and
constructed deals. With the addition of SCI, Bowater will significantly
strengthen its hand in the coated films and papers market, which boasts high
margins and good growth prospects. It will continue to drive into higher
value-added markets while disposing of its commodity-style operations along
the way. Despite sterling's depreciation, Bowater has achieved a keen price
for SCI, paying just over 14 times historic earnings, so the deal should
enhance earnings next year.
The company also has scope to squeeze more juice from its existing
businesses as yesterday's healthy profits estimates make clear. Add in the
highly cyclical nature of many of Bowater's markets, and it becomes easy to
justify the company's heady premium rating. Even so, shareholders may begin
to blanch at the speed of progress. Yesterday's Pounds 295m rights issue
will be the third in four years bringing the total of equity finance raised
to Pounds 770m. In that time, the range and complexity of Bowater's
businesses has multiplied greatly. The market's adoration may cool while
investors convince themselves Bowater's management really does have a firm
grasp on its recent purchases.

FT  17 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: The price of credibility
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
While it is helpful to have the Bank of England's detailed analysis of UK
inflation, its new report only tells half the story. Without details of the
Bank's view on the real economy, it is hard to tell whether it thinks the
benign short term inflation outlook will prove sustainable. Given that
output is severely depressed after a long recession, and that debt deflation
is curbing consumption, it is small wonder that inflation is subdued. It
would be more encouraging if the Bank was confidently predicting strong
growth and low inflation two years from now.
Unfortunately, it seems more likely that inflationary psychology has not
been broken in the UK. Despite severe deflationary forces, the underlying
rate remains near the top of the government's target range. Service sector
inflation, wage rises and bond yields all reflect cynicism about the
prospects of price stability. Importers are steadily increasing prices to
compensate for sterling's devaluation.
Under the circumstances the government's huge budget deficit is one more
reason to worry: the prospect of inflation eroding the value of debt has
tempted administrations before now. Perhaps the Budget will provide the long
term fiscal strategy needed to give the current policy credibility. If it
does not then even the justified expedient of relaxing the full funding rule
might not bring much relief. Even if the supply of gilts is reduced, long
yields will remain high if the markets believe that the government has
caught the British inflationary disease.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Bank warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S ignominious departure from the ERM on September 16 of last year
led not to perestroika, but to glasnost. Among other changes, the chancellor
has announced a target range for inflation of 1 to 4 per cent. He also
invited the Bank of England to comment on its chances of achievement.
Yesterday's first report makes sobering reading. The economy is still
bumping along the bottom, while inflation is expected to bump along at the
top of its range, with the risks mostly on the up-side.
The Bank's aim is to increase public understanding and thereby stimulate a
more informed debate. But it is not, it insists, an independent central
bank, which is why it leaves the implications for others to draw. This is a
little disingenuous, for two reasons. First, the Bank's policy conclusion is
evident from its emphasis on the risks to inflation of 'sustained further
depreciation and a faster pass-through of the depreciation that has already
taken place'. Second, the Old Lady of Threedneedle Street has been given a
rod for the chancellor's back. The unanswered question is whether she will
dare to use it when she should. On this evidence, she just might.
The report is professional in its analysis of what inflation means and of
how and why it has fallen. It is equally professional in its analysis of the
risks. It shows, in particular, that the government continues to have a
credibility problem. This will increase the real cost of achieving its
targets, which must make its determination to achieve them less credible.
The fundamental assumption underlying the exercise is that there is no
long-run trade off between inflation and unemployment. That assumption is
fully borne out by the UK's experience over the past 20 years, during which
the price level has risen six-fold and the level of unemployment five-fold.
In the short to medium term, however, things look very different. The Bank
report shows that employment has fallen still more than at the comparable
stage in the recession of the early 1980s. Meanwhile, both labour
productivity in the economy as a whole and real earnings have risen rather
more. The increase in unemployment will be durably reversed, hoever, only if
real wages at last stop rising, just as the decline in inflation will be
sustained only if the effects of depreciation on the prices of tradable
goods are not passed through into wages. Pay inflation has to fall further
and stay down, notwithstanding recovery and the lagged effects of
depreciation.
The Bank shows that achievement of the inflation target is far from secure.
In the short term, that may not matter as much as how that target will be
met. The target can be overshot temporarily, provided pay inflation
continues to decline. If it does not, what price the government's target for
inflation? How long before it too is thrown on the dustbin of history?

Will Douglas Hurd's promotion to the government somersault team hasten his
departure from politics? He turns 63 next month and as an ex-diplomat with a
relatively young family he is not as comfortably off as some of his
colleagues.
It's been rumoured for some time that he would retire before the next
election, and past form suggests a well-connected Tory politician, sorry
statesman, should have no difficulty picking up a few handsome retainers.
Lord Carrington, a former foreign secretary, went on to chair GEC, for
example, and old cronies such as Lords Howe and Tebbit have picked up some
nice little earners. Trafalgar House is known to be looking for a chairman,
and Lonrho, Barclays and HSBC Holdings may be in the market for one in the
not-too-distant future. If Hurd wants something less challenging then there
are plenty of merchant banks that would welcome him with open arms.
However, the natural place for him to go is not the City, even if he wants
to earn some money. It would be the headship of an Oxbridge college. Lesser
politicians than Hurd have gone the same way. Lord St John of Fawsley, for
example, is now Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. So have some of the
best, such as 'Rab' Butler who went on to Trinity College, Cambridge.
Hurd would be at home at any high table, and the higher the better. He would
also have time to write, whether memoirs or thrillers or both. His
thrillers, such as Scotch on the Rocks and The Smile on the Face of the
Tiger, are very good. Given time and the right environment, he might even
make more money than the down-market Lord Archer.

Dun and Bradstreet, the business information group, has just written to
Cheltenham hotelier Patrick Roach, advising him that an important customer
has just gone belly up, thereby underlining the need to keep a close eye on
the creditworthiness of his clientele.
The letter, from one David Gelstharp, marketing communications manager of
D&amp;B, turns out to be a spoof, offering Country Home Hotels the chance to
insure against the real thing happening by subscribing to an information
service which claims to keep tabs on anything that moves in corporate
Britain.
Trouble is that Roach's company itself went into liquidation at the end of
1990. Having set up a new business, which is now thriving, Roach can afford
to see the funny side of the Dun and Bradstreet's botched marketing ploy.
Let's hope Dun and Bradstreet can laugh it off as easily.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Observer: BTR puzzle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Now that 65-year-old Norman Ireland has decided to hand over the
chairmanship of Bowater to a man four months younger, could he be freeing
himself up to take over the chairmanship of BTR from his old boss, Sir Owen
Green?
Admittedly, it's unlikely. BTR is Britain's 10th biggest company and under
Sir Owen Green has been one of the country's most successful. However, Green
turns 68 in May and has indicated unofficially that he plans to retire this
year. But so far no word on his successor.
BTR has had a non-executive chairman before - Sir David Nicolson did the job
for 15 years - but given Sir Owen's thoughts about non-executive directors
it would be out of character if he encouraged his colleagues to look outside
for his successor.
The obvious internal candidate would be BTR chief executive Alan Jackson,
56. He is said to have made a success of BTR's Hawker Siddeley acquisition.
But he has only been doing his job for a couple of years, so perhaps
Ireland, who is two years younger than Sir Owen, might stand in to keep the
seat warm till Jackson is ready. Unlike British Aerospace chairman John
Cahill, another old BTR hand, Ireland does at least have time to spare now.
Just an idea.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Should the world's news agencies be judged on the speed of their reporting
or on the viciousness - or obscurity - of their ads?
Last week, in the FT, Reuters was boasting how it had tipped off the world
that the Bundesbank was going to cut interest rates 33 minutes before the
central bank's own official announcement of the February 4 policy change.
VWD, the German economic news agency, in which Reuters had a one-third
interest until 1980, blasted back yesterday - in German except for the
citation of the Reuters copy and with no explanation for the Brits as to who
or what VWD might be - that this was not true. It was there with the news a
whole 28 minutes earlier, it claimed.
Reuters says VWD's was an unsourced report; VWD, in turn, says the Reuters'
piece was 'just as much speculation as ours, but our report was harder'.
(Eh?)
VWD thinks Reuters is trying to sabotage its English language service -
though why it should then couch its rejoinder in German is a bit of a
puzzle. Reuters, almost a century older than VWD and able to trace its
German roots back to Baron de Reuter no less, just thinks the competition is
unnerved by missing out on the odd scoop recently.
As usual in the more delicious Anglo-German rows, the Bundesbank has the
last word. 'They can write what they like, but it is a little bit strange
that they should be arguing about who was the first to start a rumour.'
Back to your terminals, boys.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Back from the brink of despair: John Gapper examines
improved sentiment among UK building societies after a worrying year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an air of relief among British building societies as they prepare
to disclose their results for last year, one of the worst in the UK housing
market. Fears that the industry's foundations were threatened have receded.
'I think it is a minor miracle that we have survived as well as we have,'
says Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association.
The slump in the housing market - which brought a wave of house
repossessions and bad debts - seemed last year as if it could provoke losses
among medium-sized societies, though the fears have proved unfounded. That
would have led societies into unknown territory. Some society chief
executives talked of rejecting their traditional role of merging with
loss-makers to save them. An erosion of public confidence appeared possible.
A taste of the problems inflicted on societies based in the vulnerable south
of England housing market will be disclosed tomorrow when the
Gloucestershire-based Chelsea Building Society is expected to report sharply
reduced profits. Other large societies such as Bristol &amp; West, which lent
heavily in 1989 and 1990 to borrowers who have had difficulty meeting
mortgage repayments, will follow in the next month.
Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16
calmed the worst fears. The UK's 110 societies, descendants of the
'terminating' societies formed in the 18th century by individuals saving to
buy houses, were given a respite. The fall in base rates from 10 per cent to
7 per cent between September and December 1992 let them raise income by
delaying cuts in rates on existing mortgages, while reducing savings rates
promptly. 'We were saved a bit by Black Wednesday,' says Mr Boleat.
This windfall aside, it was a hard year for societies in the south. House
prices in the region fell by 9 to 11 per cent, while base rates remained
high for the first three-quarters of the year. As a result, some 68,500
properties were repossessed in Britain, compared with a tenth of that number
a decade earlier. A further 352,000 owners were at least six months in
arrears with their mortgages in December.
The fall in southern property values strained the insurance policies which
nearly all the societies hold to insulate them against repossession losses.
These protected them as long as properties stayed above 75 or 80 per cent of
their original value, but the limit was often breached in the south.
Premiums have risen sharply because insurers estimate that they have lost
Pounds 3bn on mortgage indemnity in the past three years.
The most chastening experience has been that of the larger societies which
merged with distressed smaller societies in 1991. Consolidation through
mergers has gradually reduced the number of societies - which numbered 289
in 1980 - and appeared virtually risk-free. Larger societies expanded their
branch networks and market share by taking on sound mortgage assets that
were well covered by reserves.
The increasing risk of mergers emerged last year. Some large societies found
they had taken on loan books in a far worse state than they imagined.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth-biggest society, merged with the troubled
Portsmouth in June 1991. 'The provisions we had to make against the
Portsmouth were vastly in excess of what a reasonable person could have
expected,' says Mr Andrew Longhurst, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester chief
executive.
Such experiences have prompted larger societies to be more cautious about
taking on others. Mr Jim Birrell, chief executive of the Halifax - the
largest society - says it is unhealthy for societies to assume they will be
rescued no matter what they do. 'It is wrong for individual members of an
industry to think whatever problems they get into will always be taken over
by others,' he says.
This attitude marks a change for an industry that has supported its weaker
members to preserve public confidence. Because societies hold the savings of
many relatively unsophisticated investors, they are vulnerable to runs on
funds if they appear weak. This is despite the fact that their average ratio
of capital to assets is 11.8 per cent - well above the international minimum
of 8 per cent set by the Bank for International Settlements.
Ms Rosalind Gilmore, the building societies commissioner who regulates the
industry, has already emphasised that she sees nothing wrong in a society
with strong reserves dipping temporarily into loss. She has received a
chorus of support from chief executives. 'There is no reason why a society
which is well managed and secure, which happens to make a loss one year,
should have to close its doors,' says Mr Longhurst.
The prospect of more than one medium-sized society making a loss nonetheless
caused some nervousness among chief executives last year. In the event, the
south's problems have been balanced by the widening of margins late in the
year, and by the performance of societies lending in the more resilient
northern market. The Northern Rock Building Society, based in
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, has already announced a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits for 1992.
The profits of the 25 largest societies are now expected to fall only 7 per
cent on average. Yet although the immediate crisis appears to have passed -
and house prices seem to be stabilising - societies in some ways face an
even harder task this year. They will have to struggle to increase profits
in a stagnant housing market, with about half the transactions of the late
1980s to attract fee income, and stiff competition for savers' funds.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
says societies are facing pressure on both sides of their balance sheets in
the coming year because of the fall in base rates.
On the deposit side, it will be hard to attract retail funds because of
higher yields on equity investments. They also face competition from the
government, which needs to attract funds through National Savings to help
finance a projected annual public deficit of Pounds 50bn. The difficulty of
attracting retail deposits under these conditions is already evident.
Societies only had a net retail fund inflow of Pounds 295m in 1992 compared
with more than Pounds 5.8bn in the previous year.
On the lending side, they will face competition from lenders offering
cheaper mortgage rates. This is because centralised lenders such as the
Household Mortgage Corporation have unfettered access to wholesale funds
that are now cheaper than societies' retail funds. Societies are limited to
borrowing 40 per cent of funds on wholesale markets under the 1986 Building
Societies Act. 'Banks and other lenders will be rushing back into the
mortgage market. The societies are going to be forced to squeeze their
margins if they do not want to lose market share,' says Mr Wriglesworth.
The last time other lenders competed so hard for mortgages was in the
mid-1980s, when societies' share of mortgage lending fell from 72.1 per cent
in 1986 to 50.6 per cent in 1987. But the level of housing transactions
meant there was a lot more business to go around. Societies now face much
lower sales: there were only 1.1m transactions in England and Wales last
year, compared with 2.1m at the peak in 1988.
The fall in transactions reduces societies' profits because each purchase
can attract an additional Pounds 1,000 or so in fee income on products such
as life insurance. Yet only a modest recovery in house sales is expected,
while the rise in arrears last year means bad debt provisions on
repossessions are likely to stay high. Provisions for last year are expected
to reach about Pounds 2bn, compared with Pounds 1.2bn for 1991.
The upshot is that while societies are relieved that 1992 did not match
their worst fears, they face a tough climate over the next few years. Those
that expected to follow Abbey National's 1989 share flotation, and abandon
mutual ownership, are now more cautious. The advantages of not having to
answer to shareholders during a period of subdued profitability has struck
some of them forcibly.
'Mutuality has been important to us in the past year,' says Mr Peter White,
chief executive of the Alliance &amp; Leicester. 'We have been able to take a
long-term view without having to look over our shoulders every few months.'
He is not the only chief executive to emerge from last year with renewed
respect for societies' traditional strengths. But the year to come may hold
just as stiff a test.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Health care in London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS VIRGINIA Bottomley, the UK health secretary, yesterday announced her
response to the Tomlinson report on the future of London's health services.
While she is stopping short of fully implementing Sir Bernard Tomlinson's
recommendations, she has given the green light to much of the report. Mrs
Bottomley has thus launched the first serious attempt to rationalise the
capital's health services in a century, in marked contrast to the shelving
of earlier reports.
London's hospitals consume 50 per cent more resources per head than those in
other large cities. The internal market in the National Health Service
leaves health authorities increasingly free to shop around for hospital
treatment. As that freedom is exercised, health authorities in the home
counties will send their patients to cheaper local hospitals rather than
more expensive beds in London. It already requires a subsidy of Pounds 50m
to keep open London's teaching hospitals; this could double next year unless
surplus beds are eliminated.
And while London's hospitals consume a disproportionate share of the NHS
budget, Londoners are ill-served by their community health services. Family
doctors outside the capital often work in large practices housed in modern
health centres offering a range of services, including some day surgery and
other forms of treatment. In London, too many family doctors are working
single-handed from lock-up premises and able to offer little by way of
screening or day care. The government will give an immediate boost to
primary health care in the capital, with innovative experiments to improve
services locally to reduce demands made on hospitals.
Mrs Bottomley has delayed final decisions on hospital closures until the
completion in May of a review into where particular specialties should be
located. But she has made it clear that many of the Tomlinson
recommendations will proceed. She has also sensibly accepted alternative
strategies where they have made sense, as, for example with the plans to
relocate the Royal Brompton and the Royal Marsden.
On the most controversial of the proposed closures, Bart's hospital in the
City of London, Mrs Bottomley has deferred a final decision. Bart's has
waged a brilliant campaign to remain open, using its connections in City and
the media with skill. Mrs Bottomley accepts that Bart's cannot survive in
its present form, but has given the hospital another six months to come up
with alternative strategies for consideration.
It is understandable that ministers have adopted a risk-averse strategy in
delaying the decision. With a 21-seat Commons majority and confidence at a
low ebb since last year's setbacks in economic policy, ministers are as
vulnerable to a parliamentary challenge on hospital closures as on pit
closures. Given these constraints, Mrs Bottomley has done well to keep the
momentum of rationalisation, even if Bart's has been awarded a temporary
reprieve.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Help on migrants
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UPHEAVALS causing flows of uprooted migrants into the rich countries of
western Europe show little sign of abating. While war rages in former
Yugoslavia, economic and political dislocation in other hard-hit parts of
eastern Europe and the developing world has become a seemingly permanent
source of instability.
The west should prepare itself for immigration pressures to persist at least
until the end of the decade. To cope with the challenge Europe needs a
strategy. Unfortunately, though not surprisingly, European interior
ministers meeting in Budapest this week failed to come up with it.
The ministers agreed to toughen measures against the criminal organisations
which charge exorbitant fees for transporting refugees illegally across
western borders. They will set up mobile police units, and intensify
information exchanges. But pleas led by the Bonn government for the rest of
Europe to pool resources in providing funds and accommodation for refugee
resettlement fell on deaf ears.
Five countries - Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden and Hungary - have
between them accommodated about 85 per cent of the more than 500,000
refugees displaced from ex-Yugoslavia since mid-1991, with roughly 250,000
of these people in Germany. In effect, these countries have now been told
that it is up to them to find solutions to difficulties posed by the
inflows.
This lack of European solidarity is short-sighted. Such a response fails to
address a problem which is growing larger, in terms of both numbers and
geographical complexity. Roughly 670,000 refugees sought political asylum
last year in western Europe, up 24 per cent from 1991, of whom 440,000
entered Germany (against 27,500 for France, 24,600 for the UK, 11,700 for
Spain and 2,500 for Italy). Hungary has turned back 1m people at its borders
since October 1991.
European countries are following a policy of trying to minimise their
exposure to refugee inflows, pushing would-be migrants back to adjacent
countries. This was the approach in the resolution on 'host third countries'
adopted by EC ministers at the end of last year, which put the onus on
dealing with refugees from Bosnia and Serbia on neighbours such as Hungary,
Croatia and Slovenia.
It is also the policy adopted, for understandable reasons, by Germany, which
is tightening its previously liberal asylum regulations through a change in
its constitution. This, inevitably, will increase strains on Poland and the
Czech Republic.
A policy which ends up concentrating refugees in countries least equipped to
accommodate them is misguided. Europe at present is unable to check the
pressures which are forcing refugees to flee from the east. But unless the
west enacts a policy which seeks to spread the burdens of assisting and
integrating them, it will share part of the blame if the potential for
disorder spreads.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Personal View: First step to blocking a two-tier Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PADDY ASHDOWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shambles of Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's legal about-turn on the
social chapter of the Maastricht treaty on Monday should not be allowed to
confuse the issues that are at stake. Labour's amendment 27, by seeking to
remove the opt-out, could only ever be the first step on the road towards
the social chapter's inclusion in the treaty. Parliament should vote in
favour, for two reasons.
First, the arrangement negotiated at Maastricht by John Major, the prime
minister, is a legal and political mess. The opt-out creates a two-tier
Europe in the social dimension which many Community experts believe to be
unworkable.
Mr Major has left Britain, in this vital area, with reduced influence,
diminished status and, once again, without the ability to shape the
institutions that will guide the Continent.
At Maastricht, the prime minister had the opportunity to negotiate a social
chapter which conformed more clearly with British desires for decentralised
decision-making and a free-market approach. He passed up that chance and
chose isolation instead. Mr Major's tactics may have given him something to
show his sceptical backbenchers when he returned from the negotiations. He
was determined to prove that he had not abandoned his predecessor's legacy.
But he has robbed his country of the ability to steer the social legislation
of the Community.
Second, the British public needs to understand and support the process of
European integration. A single market, leading to a single European
currency, will oblige British companies and employees to face up to
competitive stresses and strains.
Why should those same British men and women be denied the benefits of the
minimum social and employment legislation that is agreed at a European
level, and which will be upheld in every other member state? And has Britain
not something to learn from those of its neighbours who have shown that
co-operation and partnership can lead to economic success? All of the other
member states understand that Europe must have a social face.
A specific clause has already been inserted which requires legislation to
respect 'national practices'. Another protects the position of 'small and
medium-sized undertakings'. The chapter specifically excludes pay, the right
of association and the right to strike. All of the legislation so far
proposed has arisen not from the Maastricht treaty but from the Single
European Act, passed by a Conservative government in the 1980s.
Liberal Democrats do have concerns about the corporatist nature of some of
the procedures for decision-making within the chapter which could by-pass
the elected European Parliament. But the British government has shown no
interest in improving the democratic accountability of the Community. In any
case, such concerns should not outweigh the desire to see Britain 'at the
heart' of the Community, able to participate in all of its deliberations and
to shape its institutions.
Amendment 27 does not by itself insert the social chapter in the UK's
version of the treaty. It is a necessary step towards that end, but it is
not in itself sufficient.
Even so, the government was claiming until Monday afternoon that the
amendment, if carried, would 'wreck' the treaty. Douglas Hurd attempted to
raise the stakes further by threatening to ditch the treaty. He sounded
petulant and bullying, unsure of his case.
Now that the government's case has been blown apart, it is clear that its
problems are not technical, but political. On this occasion, Britain would
be moving towards its European partners, who would welcome the end of an
opt-out. The UK should take further steps to make this possible.
With the French elections now upon us, and with a heightened political
atmosphere at Westminster, much nonsense will be spoken over the next few
weeks about the social chapter on both sides of the Channel. Some will
allege 'social dumping'. Conservatives will claim that an opt-out is
Britain's only route to prosperity. Labour has persuaded itself that the
chapter could return Britain to the days of collectivist industrial
relations.
The truth is more mundane, but none the less important to Britain. It is in
British interests for the Community to move together as 12. Yes, there are
problems with the chapter. But these will only be solved with Britain inside
a more democratic Community.
Last November, Liberal Democrats voted to support the Maastricht treaty in
the 'paving' debate. Next month, we shall vote to improve the treaty by
supporting the social chapter.
