FT  17 FEB 93 / Bank tells Lamont to do better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'MUST do better]' is the clear message of the Bank of England's first
quarterly report on the government's efforts to meet its target range of 1
per cent to 4 per cent for underlying inflation during the life of this
parliament.
The Bank believes that the government can meet its target for annual growth
in the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments. The target
was announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, last October.
It says: 'The balance of probabilities is that inflation will be slightly
lower in 1994 than it was at the end of 1992,' when underlying inflation was
rising at an annual 3.7 per cent. Its central forecast is for this inflation
measure to stay in a 3 per cent to 4 per cent range over the next two years
with policies staying broadly unchanged.
But the emphasis placed in the 45-page report on the up-side risks to the
forecast gives added weight to the recent messages from Mr Eddie George, the
Bank governor-designate, and Mr Lamont that there is very little scope for a
further easing of monetary policy through lower interest rates.
The Bank says the consistent message from a wide range of indices is that
inflation has fallen sharply over the past two years.
It expects underlying inflation will be about 3.5 per cent this month and in
March. But for the purposes of monetary policy, the Bank must look at the
inflation outlook two years into the future.
The Bank believes that the authorities should pay close attention to the
value of the pound. The main risks to underlying inflation bursting through
the 4 per cent top of its target range come from 'the possibility of a
sustained further depreciation of sterling' and a faster pass-through to
prices of the depreciation that has taken place since sterling left the
European exchange rate mechanism on September 16. The Bank is also worried
that the UK's high fiscal deficits (forecast by the government at Pounds
37bn in 1992-93 and expected to rise further) might create expectations of
higher inflation in the future.
The changing structure of anticipated interest rates since September,
(illustrated by higher interest rates at the long end of the maturity range)
also points to a rise in expected inflation while private sector forecasts
of inflation in 1993 and 1994 suggest that the target range lacks
credibility.
Underlying inflation, the report says, should be nearer 1 per cent than the
4 per cent end of the target range at this stage of the business cycle.
January's 3.2 per cent annual inflation rate ex-mortgage interest payments
'demonstrates that there is still some way to go before the underlying
inflation rate is consistent with the objective of price stability.'
The report says the easing of monetary policy since September through the
depreciation of sterling and the cuts in bank base rates to 6 per cent from
10 per cent is consistent with the prospect of a slight reduction in
inflation in the next two years, although the progress in reducing inflation
will be slower than before September.
Cost pressures from sterling's depreciation have become apparent in the past
few months. The ability of the economy to absorb the increase in prices that
was caused by sterling's 15 per cent devaluation since September will depend
crucially on wage developments. Here some changes are needed. 'Expectations
in financial markets, and of wage earners and firms, have some way to
adjust, and a change of expectations is required,' the Bank says.
Wage increases, although sharply lower over the past two years, will have to
fall further if the UK is to keep within its inflation target while avoiding
further sharp increases in the numbers of unemployed.
The Bank warns that rising unemployment and a growing gap between output and
potential output in the UK economy will cause nominal wage increases to
decline further and profit margins to remain subdued.
It says that the consistent pursuit of a counter-inflationary monetary
policy will ensure that expectations do adjust and that price stability is
attained.
But its report concludes with a clear warning: 'Steady progress has been
made towards achievement of the government's inflation objective but further
progress is required.'

FT  17 FEB 93 / Manufacturing blow to recovery hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING output fell in each of the latter two quarters of last year,
according to government statistics issued yesterday which do little to
support hopes of a recov-ery.
The output of all production industries, including manufacturing, energy and
water, dropped last year for the third year running - the first time that
this has happened since the early 30s.
The seasonally adjusted data indicate that manufacturing production, which
accounts for just under a quarter of the economy, has yet to show any
significant rebound from its trough during the re-cession in the fourth
quarter of 1991.
During 1992 production by the sector was down 0.8 per cent compared with the
previous year. That followed a 5.2 per cent annual fall in 1991 and one of
0.5 per cent the previous year.
Last year output of mineral products, metals and mechanical goods dropped in
each case by more than 4 per cent compared with 1991, while food, chemicals
and artificial fibres all experienced an output increase of more than 1 per
cent.
In the last quarter of last year manufacturing volumes were down 0.2 per
cent compared with the previous quarter that came after a 0.1 per cent drop
between the second and third three-month periods.
Manufacturing saw a provisional rise in production of 0.1 per cent in
December compared with November.
In the three months between October and December last year output by the
manufacturing sector was up by just 0.4 per cent compared with the low point
for the sector a year previously.
In the fourth quarter, aided by a 6.3 per cent quarterly jump in North Sea
oil and gas extraction, output of all production industries was 0.9 per cent
up on the previous three months.
But for the year as a whole, output by these industries, which account for
just over one third of gross domestic product, was down 0.4 per cent
compared with the previous 12 months.
The sector registered year-on-year falls of 3 per cent and 0.6 per cent
respectively in 1991 and 1990.
In the fourth quarter of last year car production was down 4.9 per cent
compared with the previous three months.
Over the same period the metals, artificial fibres and mineral-products
industries registered quarterly production falls of 7.1 per cent, 4.9 per
cent and 3.6 per cent respectively.
Output of chemicals and electrical products increased by a quarterly 3.1 per
cent in both cases.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Forum paves way for FM successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NATIONAL forum to promote digital audio broadcasting (Dab), a new sound
broadcasting technology, was announced yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine,
the trade and industry secretary.
Describing Dab as an important development, he said the forum would involve
broadcasters, equipment manufacturers, retailers and service providers. Dab
is expected to replace FM broadcasts over a 15 to 25-year period, starting
with the first commercial Dab broadcasts in 1995.
Dab offers the prospect of compact-disc quality sound and improved reception
in car radios and portable receivers. It also makes it possible to provide a
greater number of services using the same radio spectrum.
A preliminary specification for the technology, developed under the European
collaborative research programme Eureka, is already before the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute.
Among the organisations collaborating on the project are the BBC, Philips of
the Netherlands, Grundig of Germany and Thomson of France.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Economic activity weakening rapidly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY is weakening rapidly in much of western Europe with
falling business and consumer confidence posing 'a clear downside risk to
prospects in most European countries', the Bank of England reports, Peter
Norman writes.
In a review of economic developments among the UK's leading trading partners
the Bank says in its latest quarterly bulletin that worsening conditions in
western Europe and Japan have been largely offset by strengthening in the US
in the past three months.
The US recovery means that growth for the 'major six' economies - the US,
Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada - slowed only moderately to an
annualised 1 per cent in the third quarter of last year from a 2.2 per cent
annual rate in the first half.
The French, Italian and German economies contracted in the third quarter of
last year and the recession in Germany seemed set to continue into this
year, the Bank says. But it expects the six will still achieve 'moderate
growth' in aggregate in 1993.
It adds that production is running below potential in all six countries,
with 'output gaps' ranging from 0.4 per cent in Italy to 6.5 per cent in
Canada.
The average output gap of about 2 per cent will dampen in-flationary
pressures in the six as a group.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Government reaches first surplus for a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH CORPORATION tax revenues, coupled with relatively low government
spending, contributed to a higher-than-expected Pounds 3.83bn surplus in
government finances in January. It was the first monthly surplus for a year.
About Pounds 1bn of the surplus was due to a new system for collecting value
added tax from big companies on a monthly basis. This brought forward to
January receipts which would normally be paid this month.
The large surplus recorded for January is likely to be countered by big
deficits this month and in March. These are expected to push the public
sector borrowing requirement for 1992-93 to about Pounds 37bn, after a
Pounds 13.7bn deficit in 1991-92.
The Treasury and Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the PSBR for
the first 10 months of the year came to Pounds 21.6bn, compared with Pounds
6.5bn at the same stage in 1991-92. The deficit has increased as the
recession has reduced tax receipts and pushed up spending on unemployment.
Receipts last month were boosted by a Pounds 5.27bn payment of corporation
tax. Another factor was relatively low central government spending in
January of Pounds 20.15bn, only slightly higher than the comparable Pounds
19.46bn last year.
Total central government receipts last month came to Pounds 23.0bn, compared
with Pounds 23.33bn in January last year. The surplus for January last year
was Pounds 3.78bn. Privatisation proceeds last month came to just Pounds 4m.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Accountancy body may trim scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE self-regulatory body for chartered accountants who conduct investment
business is considering reducing the monitoring of its members.
Mr Bruce Picking, director of practice regulation at the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said 'embryonic' discussions
were under way to increase the period between inspections by the joint
monitoring unit, which is run by all the chartered accountants' institutes
in the British Isles.
The unit at present visits every five years all 6,000 chartered accountants
registered to conduct investment business. It visits every two years all
those - numbering only about 600 - who are authorised to hold clients'
money.
But Mr Picking said: 'We are considering lightening the burden. We don't
need blanket monitoring with visits. We may move to a more risk-based
approach.'
He stressed that inspectors would continue to monitor annual returns from
all registered firms and would carry out targeted visits to those which
required greater attention.
The discussions come soon after the institute made representations to Mr
Andrew Large, the chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, over the
regulatory demands imposed on accountants.
Accountants already had to comply with their own codes of professional
conduct and investment business comprised a small fraction of their work -
estimated at only 1.5 per cent of fee income.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Virgin steps up challenge to BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD BRANSON'S Virgin Atlantic Airways is stepping up its challenge to
British Airways and launching a new service from London's Heathrow Airport
to New York's Newark Airport. The service is expected to start at the end of
next month.
Mr Branson, who is still seeking compensation from BA for the commercial
damage he claims his airline suffered from BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign, is
expected to announce the start of the new service when he opens Virgin's new
Pounds 1m passenger lounge at Heathrow next week.
Virgin will switch its present Newark service from London's Gatwick airport
to Heathrow because the airline has secured necessary take-off and landing
slots at the bigger airport.
Mr Branson said the service would enable Virgin to compete directly against
BA on the Newark route out of Heathrow.
The Virgin chairman said yesterday the airline planned to resume a separate
service from Gatwick to Newark next year, when it expects to receive new
aircraft to increase the size of its fleet.
Virgin is in advanced talks with the European Airbus consortium to acquire
four A340 long-range jets with an option for an extra one. It is also
negotiating with Boeing to acquire a 747-400 jumbo with options for the
Boeing 777 twin engine widebodied airliner.
The Newark service will bring to four the long haul destinations served by
Virgin from Heathrow.
The airline already operates to Los Angeles, New York's JFK airport and
Tokyo. It plans to start additional services to San Francisco and
Johannesburg from Heathrow later this year if it can secure the necessary
slots.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Criteria review at investor watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulatory body for
retail financial services, has appointed Sir Brian Jenkins, a partner at
accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to conduct an independent review of
membership criteria.
The appointment follows a letter in December to the PIA's board from Mr
Andrew Large, Securities and Investments Board chairman, saying the PIA
would not be approved as a self-regulatory body unless it raised standards
of investor protection. Sir Brian is expected to seek a meeting with Mr
Large to discuss SIB's requirements.
The PIA board said it had asked Sir Brian for recommendations on how to
assess the 'fitness and properness' of applicants, and on standards for
members to meet and transitional arrangements to meet those standards.
Sir Brian will also seek meetings with banks, building societies, unit
trusts, life offices and representatives of the independent advisory sector.
It is expected that he will complete his report to the PIA board by April or
May.
The move is seen as a sign that the retail financial services industry has
taken seriously the threat that SIB might refuse to recognise the PIA. Some
in the industry have urged the PIA board to resist Mr Large's demands -
particularly the minimum capital requirement for members and the insistence
that the PIA must vet all firms, even if they were previously members of
another self-regulatory body.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Relatives to claim on income plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIVES of the victims of home income plans will be allowed to continue to
claim compensation even after the death of a victim, the High Court ruled
yesterday.
Investment bond home income plans were sold in the late 1980s, mainly to
elderly people as a way of releasing income from their homes.
The schemes involved taking out a mortgage and investing in equity-linked
bonds. The value of these bonds fell as the stock market performed poorly
and mortgage rates rose. Elderly people were pushed into debt and, as house
prices fell, some lost their homes.
In cases where the risks of the schemes were not explained victims can
receive compensation from the Investors Compensation Scheme to a maximum of
Pounds 48,000.
Barnett Sampson, solicitors, which represents 450 home income plan cases,
sought a judicial review of the ICS's stipulation that a claim ceased when
the victim died.
The High Court ruled yesterday that the 'personal representative' of a
deceased person can bring or continue a claim on their behalf.
But the Court ruled against the claimants on other points. Barnett Sampson
argued that the ICS should not deduct from compensation any money claimants
spent in the mistaken belief they were spending profit on investment rather
than capital - a couple might not have spent money on a holiday if they had
known it would be eating into their capital.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Lucas Industries to lay off 510 staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries, the international engineering group, plans to lay off 510
employees at its plants which make pumps for diesel engines, in Gillingham
and Rochester, Kent.
The group yesterday blamed falling demand, especially in the agricultural
machinery and off-highway vehicle markets.
Some redundancies had been expected at the plants. Last October Lucas said
it would reduce its workforce by 2,750, half of which would be in the UK -
reducing the worldwide Lucas workforce to 47,000 from 59,000 in July 1990.
The Rochester plant, which has 156 employees, will close this summer.
The Gillingham plant, which also supplies diesel fuel injection systems for
the Ford Transit van, has 1,856 employees.
Yesterday Lucas could not say how many of the latest round of redundancies
sprang from the fall in orders and how many were the result of the planned
slimming of the group workforce.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Foreign exchange tax more equitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES will be subject to more equitable taxation on foreign exchange
gains and losses under long awaited and radical draft legislation circulated
yesterday by the Inland Revenue.
The changes will principally affect any UK companies that take out finance
in foreign currencies and those with assets held in foreign currencies
subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations.
The rules will permit them to offset losses on exchange fluctuations against
tax for the first time. Previously they have been taxed on any exchange
gains without being allowed to take any corresponding allowances for losses.
The Revenue said the legislation would not be retrospective, so it will not
help companies which suffered heavy exchange losses after the depreciation
of sterling when Britain withdrew from the exchange rate mechanism last
autumn.
Tax practitioners generally welcomed the proposals as a change that would
bring the UK into line with tax regimes in other countries.
Mr Derek Jenkins, a tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'This gives
British companies more of a level playing field with the rest of the world.
They will be taxed on their trading transactions in foreign currencies in
the same way as they are accounted for in economic terms.'
Ms Emma Lubbock of Price Waterhouse said: 'Companies will welcome the
certainty of tax treatment and the removal of anomalies.'
She said they would find the 40 pages of regulations and notes daunting. The
Revenue said the effect of the changes would be broadly tax neutral, with
any losses from the introduction of allowances being offset by new taxes on
gains which were outside the remit of previous legislation.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Customs seize jet parts destined for Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS AND Excise officers are interviewing a number of UK businessmen
after seizing about 12,000 counterfeit engine parts for US-made Iranian jet
fighters.
The Customs investigation is centred on a company called DBI based near
Maidenhead, Berks. The company is run by Mr Richard Patrick, a Canadian-born
former wing commander.
The Customs and Excise Department refused last night to comment on the
investigation.
Customs have seized about 7,500 compressor blades for Northrop F-5 fighter
engines with a sale value of about Dollars 1m.
The parts were ordered by the Iranian government's foreign procurement
mangement centre and the end user is believed to be the Iranian Air Force,
which operates 65 ageing F-5E and F-5Fs.
The blades are copies of parts made by General Electric of the US. The
company said last night it had been contacted by UK Customs officials
following the seizure of the blades to help in their identification.
A General Electric representative based in the UK was instrumental in
identifying the unmarked blades as copies of those used for a J85 engine
used in F-5 fighter aircraft. General Electric ceased manufacturing the
blades in 1987.
DBI subcontracted the work to two unidentified engineering companies which
apparently did not know the parts were destined for Iran.
Mr Patrick, 75, has been investigated previously by Customs officers. On the
last occasion in 1988 a prosecution was withdrawn when he agreed to pay a
Pounds 40,000 customs penalty for exporting ball bearings for Iranian jet
aircraft.
The previous investigation involved a company called Dixie Barings
International, then based at Heathrow.
Mr Patrick, who could not be contacted last night, was reported in the
magazine to have said that the Iranians told him the blades were for use on
civilian Fokker F27 aircraft.
Fokker said in the same report it had no knowledge of any kit designed to
convert the propeller-driven F27 to be driven by jet engines.
Six businessmen were initially charged after the previous customs
investigation into Mr Patrick's exports, but all are understood to have
reached a 'compounded settlement' with Customs which involves paying hefty
penalties in return for the withdrawal of the prosecution.
Sales of military spare parts, such as the blades for engines, to Iran have
been subject to embargoes in the US and the UK both following the 1979
revolution and as a result of the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq in
the 1980s.
One defence industry expert in the US said last night that the embargoes
were unlikely to be lifted while Tehran persisted in its death threat
against Salman Rushdie.
In Tehran Mr Akbar Torkan, the minister of defence, made clear recently,
however, his country's overwhelming need for spare parts for equipment
bought from the US before the downfall of the Shah in 1979.
The Iranian Air Force includes among its aircraft some 60 F-4D and Es, and a
further 60 F-5 Es and Fs in addition to squadrons of more modern F-14s and
MiG-29s.
Details of the investigation appear in today's issue of Flight International
magazine.
Mr Andrew Chuter, the editor, said: 'These are quite old aeroplanes and they
are quite old engines used in them. But to actually make the blades, which
are the most important parts of the engine, is probably beyond them, so they
have to look elsewhere.
'They can't get them from the Americans because of the embargo. So they have
clearly decided to get them engineered elsewhere. It's reverse engineering
or it's pirated - call it what you want.
'Because this is mid 1950s technology we are talking about steel compressor
blades - rather than the state-of-the-art stuff today which might be
titanium or composites - the materials are probably not exotic as they are
these days.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIVES of the victims of home income plans will be allowed to continue to
claim compensation even after the death of a victim, the High Court ruled
yesterday.
Investment bond home income plans were sold in the late 1980s, mainly to
elderly people as a way of releasing income from their homes.
The schemes involved taking out a mortgage and investing in equity-linked
bonds. The value of these bonds fell as the stock market performed poorly
and mortgage rates increased. In cases where the risks of the schemes were
not explained victims can receive compensation from the Investors
Compensation Scheme to a maximum of Pounds 48,000.
Barnett Sampson, the solicitors, which represents 450 home income plan
cases, had sought a judicial review of the stipulation that a claim ceased
when the victim died.

THE present bias in fraud trials towards defendants should be changed to
simplify issues and shorten the time cases spend in court, the judge in the
final Guinness trial said yesterday, John Mason writes.
Mr Justice Turner criticised the present procedure under which the
prosecution has to outline all details of its case at the start of a trial
while defence lawyers can withhold material to set up 'ambushes'.
In the final Guinness trial, which ended with Mr Thomas Ward being acquitted
on Monday, much time had been spent pursuing matters that were never live
issues, he said. The single real issue before the jury had been whether Mr
Ward's Pounds 5.2m fee had been dishonestly obtained. 'Why should this issue
have taken five weeks to resolve?' he asked.
His comments were welcomed by Mr George Staple, director of the Serious
Fraud Office.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Contracting-out fears dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIAM Waldegrave, public service minister, has sought to head off
concern that the government's drive to contract out public services will be
derailed by legal uncertainties over the rights of employees involved.
He says in a pamphlet published yesterday that the protests are 'simply the
usual noise you get when a major new policy begins to affect powerful vested
interests'.
Mr Waldegrave also says it is 'not unreasonable' to expect market testing in
the future to produce savings averaging 25 per cent - even when work is not
contracted out but continues to be performed by in-house providers.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, will today chair a Downing Street seminar
of ministers and senior civil servants on the next stages of the Citizen's
Charter. The seminar is likely to cover how competitive tendering and market
testing can be extended.
Fears about contracting out arise because legal advice suggests that under
the 1977 European Acquired Rights Directive, civil servants affected may
have to be offered equal employment conditions when transferred to a new
employer. If they are not, the government could be liable to damages.
In his pamphlet, Public Service and the Future, Mr Waldegrave says market
testing has faced 'vociferous criticism' from public-sector unions.
'A final desperate ploy is to allege that the European Acquired Rights
Directive will stop the policy: it will not, any more than it has stopped
the tens of thousands of private-sector transfers of undertakings since 1977
when it was passed,' he adds.
Mr Waldegrave also used his pamphlet to launch a thinly disguised attack on
some newspapers' coverage of the royal family. He complained of 'the
savagery of the attack on members of the royal family for no reason other
than the exploitation of the pain of an unhappy marriage'.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Fading influence of ghosts of Clydeside past: The
differences between industrial disputes in the 1970s and those of today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PICKETING the gates of Yarrow Shipbuilders union official John Dolan
dismisses the ghost of Red Clydeside with a shrug.
'This dispute has been eight months brewing. On Red Clydeside they would
just have walked out on the first day,' he says.
The 1,300 men of Yarrow Shipbuilders are settling in for their second week
of an indefinite strike over wages, while next door the 550 workers of
Leyland Daf's Albion axles plant have voted for industrial action in the
hope of putting pressure on the government to help the stricken truckmaker.
The Clydeside setting of the neighbouring disputes lends them a resonance
beyond their real moment, but there are some parallels with the 1960s and
1970s. Then there were frequent disputes, culminating in the 1972 work-in at
Upper Clyde Shipbuilders after its closure was announced .
The work-in added to pressure on the Heath government, which eventually
agreed to provide state support to the yards, abandoning its policy of
refusing to salvage 'lame ducks' at a time of high unemployment - then about
1m.
For all the parallels, Mr Jimmy Airlie, one of the leaders of the UCS
work-in, does not see the Yarrow dispute and the Daf strike vote as the
rebirth of confrontational unionism in Scotland. 'There is no direct link
between the two current disputes, no trend, and the political context has
changed completely.'
Mr Airlie, now the AEEU electrical and engineering union's executive council
member for Scotland, says the two groups of workers share a heritage within
which industrial action remains a legitimate last resort.
The Yarrow dispute owes as much to Lady Thatcher's 1980s as it does to the
decades before. The men say they are not being rewarded adequately for the
low pay rises and changes in working practices which helped to keep the yard
going and to win the Pounds 700m in orders now on its books.
Skilled workers do boilermakers' work as a matter of course and wages have
been kept so low that most of their wives must work too, they say.
The company points out that to win the orders it had to put in competitive
bids, which assumed low costs.
Some things never change. The workforce which rejected the company's
above-inflation pay offer - against the advice of union officials - says the
management style of Mr Murray Easton, Yarrow's managing director, is partly
to blame for the deadlock.
He is the son of the company's former manager director and the workforce
says it is offended by his 'spoilt wee boy' approach to negotiations.
The workforce is deeply opposed to this year's pay settlement being
expressed as a Pounds 300 lump sum, rather than an increase in basic pay
which would be reflected in holiday pay and eventual pension benefits.
Mr Francis McNeill, who has worked for Yarrow for 18 years, says: 'We have
had more than 800 redundancies in the last 14 months. We just had to sit
back and accept it. We had no press coverage although there were guys tapped
on the shoulder at two and three in the morning and told to go. They called
a strike over 67 job losses down the road at Daf's'

FT  17 FEB 93 / GKN to resume supplies to Daf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GKN, one of the biggest component suppliers to Leyland Daf, yesterday struck
an agreement with the receivers to resume deliveries of all components to
the beleaguered truck and van maker.
GKN is the source of axles, prop shafts and other main components. Without
them the truck plant in Leyland, Lancashire, and the van plant in Birmingham
would have no prospect of resuming steady production to meet orders for
several thousand vehicles which some customers, such as Royal Mail and
Parcelforce, have so far refrained from withdrawing.
Leyland Daf executives were hoping last night that the decision by GKN, one
of the UK's biggest industrial groups, to resume deliveries would act as a
catalyst to other suppliers to follow suit. About two dozen other suppliers
have suspended deliveries.
Hours before the agreement with GKN, employees from the Birmingham plant had
travelled to Dunstable, Bedfordshire, where they staged a protest outside an
AC Delco components plant in an effort to persuade the General Motors
subsidiary to resume supplies of wiper motors.
A spokesman for the receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of
accountants Arthur Andersen, said hopes were now rising that 'something
resembling full production' would be resumed at the van plant by the end of
this week.
The situation at Leyland is more difficult, however, with little prospect of
more than completion of vehicles already on the assembly line.
Meanwhile the receivers made redundant 80 of the 270 Birmingham-based staff
still assigned to the Excel project, a joint venture between Renault and Daf
to create a new range of vans.
The move was expected to be the first stage in winding up the Birmingham end
of the project, with Renault likely to announce shortly - possibly today -
that it plans to proceed with the project on its own or that it has found a
replacement partner.

FT  17 FEB 93 / A long-term commitment to cost cuts: How ministers who are
keen to reduce the immense social security budget are boxed in by manifesto
commitments - Public Spending Review / Social Services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOCIAL security department's budget is the largest target in the sights
of the government's review of public expenditure.
As the highest spending department - Pounds 74bn this year, more than a
quarter of government spending - it is where the biggest savings might be
expected.
Also, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, like Mr Michael
Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury who is carrying out the
review, is on the Conservative right and might be expected to be
enthusiastic about the unthinkable in seeking new ways to cut public
spending.
But, eager though he might be to curtail public spending, Mr Lilley will
find it hard to offer Mr Portillo savings that will make much impact before
the next century. Indeed, he might find that the withdrawal of the state
from some central areas of social security will initially cost money, rather
than saving it.
The elderly get nearly half the social security cake, most of it for the
flat-rate basic pension paid to almost everyone over state retirement age -
65 for men and 60 for women.
The basic pension accounts for about a third of the social security budget
and 10 per cent of public spending as a whole. Yet while it is an important
part of most pensioner incomes it is of declining importance to the growing
numbers who retire with substantial occupational pensions and savings.
Until now most attention has focused on ways in which the state could stop
paying the basic pension to the minority of pensioners who are well-enough
off to provide for themselves. In previous years the government has made
much of targeting additional help to the most needy through means-tested
benefits. One policy option - under consideration by Labour's Commission on
Social Justice - would be to extend means-testing to the state pension.
But Mr Lilley seems to have set his face against offering Mr Portillo a
means-tested pension. One reason is that it would involve breaking a
manifesto promise to continue paying the pension as at present and uprating
it annually in line with inflation. There is also a strong Conservative
aversion to further 'intrusive' means-testing, well expressed in a recent
pamphlet by Mr David Willetts, the MP for Havant who formerly directed the
Centre for Policy Studies, the think tank founded by Baroness Thatcher and
Lord Joseph.
The other options likely to be considered are no easier. Mr Willetts wants
to spend more on some pensioners - the over-80s - who are less likely than
recently retired pensioners to have substantial income from savings or
occupational pensions, and so are more likely to be at the lower end of the
income distribution.
To pay for this, Mr Willetts proposes raising the retirement age to 65 for
all (and possibly to 67 eventually). Some of the Pounds 3bn saved in this
way could be ploughed into higher pensions for the over-80s - which could
later be phased out as all pensioners came to enjoy some private pension
income. The savings from such a move would be slow in coming through.
A similar delay in reaping savings may be expected from proposals from the
Adam Smith Institute, the free-market think tank, to extract the state from
the provision of welfare benefits. Dr Madsen Pirie, institute president,
will unveil a strategy he describes as the privatisation of choice in a
pamphlet to be published tomorrow.
This extends the approach adopted by Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party
chairman, in offering incentives to people who opt out of the state
earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) into personal pension policies. The
institute will advocate incentives for people who opt out of other parts of
the welfare state, especially the fast-growing sickness and invalidity
benefits.
No one would lose entitlement to the present welfare benefits if they wished
to stick with them, so no manifesto pledges need be broken. The policies
which qualified for the incentives would, like the pension policies which
allow opting out of Serps, guarantee minimum levels of benefits. The problem
is that providing incentives to opt out would almost certainly add to the
cost in the short term. The Serps incentives have cost more than Pounds 6bn,
which might not be recouped through the payment of lower pensions for a very
long time.
These are not the only ideas on the table for the Portillo review. There is
interest in the idea that employers, rather than the state, should be
responsible for industrial disablement benefits. This would make little
impact on the Pounds 650m these benefits will cost next year, but would mean
that no more people would become eligible in future.
Ministers might also consider making individuals responsible for their own
unemployment insurance, to eat into the Pounds 2bn-a-year cost of
unemployment benefit. If this also included cover for mortgage payments,
some of the more than Pounds 10bn of income support paid to the unemployed
might be saved. Again, both measures could only be applied to people
becoming unemployed in the future, reducing the immediate savings that would
be possible.
Ministers may also find time to return to an earlier proposal from Mr
Willetts to freeze child benefit at its present level and concentrate future
increases on the under-fives, whose family income is usually affected by the
mother stopping work. As with basic pension, however, there are manifesto
commitments that would make it hard to touch the Pounds 6bn child benefit
bill before the next election.
All this suggests that Mr Lilley and Mr Portillo will find it hard to make
significant savings in the social security budget in the near future. In
spite of the size of the target, ministers are boxed in by manifesto
commitments and the cost of persuading taxpayers to switch from state
welfare benefits to private provision.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Timex suspends threat to sack 300
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT at the Dundee-based Timex Electronics plant yesterday issued and
withdrew a threat to sack about 300 striking workers pending the outcome of
a mass meeting of the workforce to be held this morning.
The factory's 500 production workers are in their third week of an all-out
strike over management's decision to lay off 200 of them - including all the
shop stewards and the factory convener - after the US-owned company
experienced a 'prolonged' downturn in demand.
Timex said: 'Management were intending to issue dismissal notices to about
300 striking workers.' The company had agreed to 'delay' issuing the notices
ahead of today's mass meeting at the request of the AEEU engineering and
electrical union.
It is understood the workforce will consider a previously rejected
four-point peace plan that was drawn up by management in both Dundee and in
the parent Timex Corporation in Walterbury, Connecticut.
The package offered employees a 50 per cent share in this year's profits and
arbitration on the issue of lay-offs, following an immediate return to work
in return for a cut in fringe benefits and a wage freeze for the rest of the
year, the company said.
Earlier, scuffles briefly broke out between police attempting to keep the
roads around the factory clear and pickets. Police said the incident had not
resulted in any injuries or arrests.
As many as 305,344 workers have lost their jobs in manufacturing industry
over the past two years, according to the latest job-loss survey by the
Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union published yesterday.
A total of 33,352 went in 377 different companies between October 9 last
year and Monday of this week, with the largest contractions being in London
and the south-east and the west Midlands.
Mr Bill Jordan, the union's president, said the figures showed the jobs
crisis in Britain was deepening.

FT  17 FEB 93 / PIA calls in Coopers man
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulatory body for
retail financial services, has appointed Sir Brian Jenkins, a partner at
accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to conduct an independent review of
membership criteria.
The appointment follows a letter in December to the PIA's board from Mr
Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board saying the
PIA would not be approved as a self-regulatory body unless it raised
standards of investor protection.
The PIA board said it had asked Sir Brian for recommendations on how to
assess the 'fitness and properness' of new applicants, and on standards for
members to meet and transitional arrangements to meet those standards.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Further 80 jobs are shed at Daf
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATIVE receivers of the Leyland Daf truck and vans group yesterday
made redundant 80 of the 270 Birmingham-based staff still assigned to the
Excel project, a joint venture between Renault and Daf to create a new range
of vans.
The move was expected to be the first stage in winding up the Birmingham end
of the project, with Renault expected soon to announce either that it plans
to proceed alone or has found a new partner.
The receivers said last night that negotiations over the exact future of the
Excel facilities were continuing.
Yesterday's redundancies came as employees from the Birmingham plant
travelled to Dunstable, where they staged a protest outside an AC Delco
components plant in an effort to persuade the General Motors subsidiary to
resume supplies of wiper motors to the van plant.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Foreign exchange tax to be more equitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES will be subject to more equitable taxation on foreign exchange
gains and losses, under long-awaited and radical draft legislation
circulated yesterday by the Inland Revenue.
The changes will principally affect any UK companies that take out finance
in foreign currencies and those with assets held in foreign currencies
subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations.
The rules will permit them to offset losses on exchange fluctuations against
tax for the first time. Previously they have been taxed on any exchange
gains without being allowed to take any corresponding allowances for losses.
The Revenue said the legislation would not be retrospective, so it will not
help companies which suffered heavy exchange losses after the depreciation
of sterling when Britain withdrew from the exchange rate mechanism last
autumn.
Tax practitioners generally welcomed the proposals as a change that would
bring the UK into line with tax regimes in other countries.
Mr Derek Jenkins, a tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'This gives
British companies more of a level playing field with the rest of the world.
They will be taxed on their trading transactions in foreign currencies in
the same way as they are accounted for in economic terms.'
Ms Emma Lubbock of Price Waterhouse said: 'Companies will welcome the
certainty of tax treatment and the removal of anomalies.' She said they
would find the 40 pages of regulations and notes daunting. The Revenue said
the effect of the changes would be broadly tax neutral, with any losses from
the introduction of allowances being offset by new taxes on gains which were
outside the remit of previous legislation.
The draft regulations have been circulated for comment before the end of
March following a previous consultation document in 1991.
The legislation is unlikely to be enacted until next year at the earliest.
Practitioners said the new version reflected the comments made during
consultations with organisations, including the so-called 'Group of Nine'
professional bodies and corporate representatives.
Mr Jenkins said there were still concerns about the apparent exclusion from
the new rules of allowances for foreign exchange losses of holding
companies, and for foreign companies with a series of UK operations.
He also expressed doubts about the fairness of some of the provisions for
anti-avoidance on loans between related parties and on inconsistent taxes
and allowances on unrealised gains.
Ms Lubbock said that in the short term companies that had structured their
operations to accomodate exisiting tax arrangements would be concerned about
the implications of the new system and how it would be implemented.
She said the new arrangements would treat all exchange movements on monetary
balances as part of ordinary taxable income, removing the tax distinction
between long-term and short-term balances.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Southern Electric in flexible work deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHERN Electric, the privately-owned utility, yesterday agreed a flexible
working pattern with its 5,000 employees which it believes is the first of
its kind among the main UK utilities.
Mr Henry Casley, chief executive, said the agreement 'broke the mould of 40
years of traditional nationalised industry thinking' with the help of the
'positive and constructive attitude of the staff and the trade unions'.
The five unions, in return for a 2.9 per cent pay rise and one-off lump sum
payments averaging Pounds 200, have accepted the phased introduction of a
six-day working week over the next 18 months and a big reduction in
voluntary overtime which costs the company Pounds 10m a year.
The deal is expected to set an example for other privately-owned utilities
and follows the end of national pay bargaining which covered the electricity
supply industry for 40 years.
The company said the deal would increase productivity by as much as 25 per
cent. It would help to produce annual pay savings of at least Pounds 15m by
the mid-1990s.
Mr John Peach, area negotiator for the Electrical section of the Amalgamated
Engineering and Electrical Union, said it was a 'tough' agreement and he was
'not ecstatic about it', but at a time of recession it was acceptable. The
workers accepted the deal in a secret ballot by 58 per cent for to 42 per
cent against.
Mr Peach stressed the company had promised job security and no compulsory
redundancies.
At present workers work a 37-hour week from Monday to Friday over an 8am to
5pm working day, with voluntary overtime. Their new 37-hour week will be
applied flexibly over a 12-hour working day from 8am to 8pm Monday to Friday
and 8am to 5pm on Saturdays.
Premium payments will continue for work outside those hours and on Sundays.
All restrictive practices and demarcation lines are to be abolished and the
number of grades cut from 29 to 11.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Commission to study US airline industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration is calling for a commission to be set up to
produce solutions to what it calls the 'crisis' in the US airline industry.
'I think it is very clear we have a crisis,' said Mr Federico Pena,
transportation secretary, as he backed calls for an airlines commission
yesterday.
Mr Pena said the 15-member commission, with five members each nominated by
the president and the Senate and House leaders, should complete its report
in 90 days.
'It's not going to be a report that's put on a shelf somewhere,' Mr Pena
said.
Mr Pena was joined by both Democratic and Republican congressmen, who said
the Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.6bn) of losses generated by the airline industry
over the last three years made the situation critical.
Air transport policy came to the fore in last year's election campaign as
the airlines lobbied fiercely over whether whether British Airways should be
allowed to take a large stake in USAir.
United, Delta and American, the three biggest US airlines, continue to
oppose the proposed tie-up and have been pressing for an inquiry. They argue
that allowing BA to proceed would give it complete access to the US air
transport market while they remained shut out of the British market and cost
them more than Dollars 500m a year in lost revenue.
Besides problems of foreign competition, the US airlines also complain that
they suffer from excessive regulation and from the unfair competition of
airlines which continue to operate while under the protection of the
bankruptcy code.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Christopher plays down peace hopes: Mideast visit starts
tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US SECRETARY of state, Mr Warren Christopher, yesterday sought to damp down
expectations of a breakthrough in the Middle East peace process during his
first visit to the region beginning tomorrow.
He said that he did not expect early agreement on a date for resumption of
peace negotiations which have been suspended since the middle of December.
Instead, he wanted to get 'some sense' of how the talks were viewed by
regional leaders in the hope that a date for the ninth round of talks could
be fixed fairly soon after his return to Washington.
Mr Christopher will travel first to Egypt then to Jordan, Syria, Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait and Israel.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organisation repeated
yesterday that it would not resume negotiations with Israel until the fate
of nearly 400 Palestinians expelled to southern Lebanon had been
satisfactorily resolved.
'We cannot participate in the peace talks even if the other Arab states are
willing to,' Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, the PLO's information director, told
Reuters.
He said Palestinian leaders in the occupied territories would tell Mr
Christopher that they insisted Israel should immediately take back the
Palestinian activists as demanded by UN resolution 799 before they would
rejoin the peace talks.
Israel agreed a compromise formula with the US last week allowing for 100 of
the Palestinians to return immediately to the occupied territories in order
to head off the threat of UN sanctions and to encourage Arab delegations to
draw a line under the episode. However, it is doubtful whether Syria, Jordan
or Lebanon will resume negotiations without the Palestinians.
President Bill Clinton said in a statement yesterday that his decision to
send Mr Christopher to the region was an indication of the priority the
administration was giving to the Middle East. He warned of the dangers that
this 'historic opportunity could all too easily slip away'.

CIVIL rights activist the Rev Jesse Jackson yesterday urged President Bill
Clinton to end the crisis over Aids-infected Haitians quarantined at a US
Navy base, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Jackson is on hunger strike in sympathy with 267 Haitians infected with
the HIV virus that causes Aids who are quarantined at the US naval base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
'Mr Clinton's policy on Haiti is a sound one - restore democracy, return
(exiled Haitian President Jean Bertrand) Aristide, but delaying becomes
denial,' Mr Jackson said.
Mr Jackson said he would continue his hunger strike for at least this week.
'It's a kind of leprosy island, and there they are desperate, they're in the
dark and they're dying,' he said.
Mr Clinton has said he wants to lift the immigration prohibitions preventing
people with Aids from entering the US, but has taken no action.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Jamaican campaign starts early: Indications that there may
be a snap election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMAICA'S political parties have started campaigning for a general election,
even though the date of the poll has not yet been announced by Mr P J
Patterson, the prime minister.
The election is constitutionally due within a year, but Mr Patterson is
widely expected to call an early vote in the next eight weeks.
The prime minister, who took office a year ago after the resignation of Mr
Michael Manley because of poor health, is thought to be keen to get his own
popular mandate. However, pressure on him to call an early election is also
being determined by developments which suggest that his People's National
Party has a better than even chance of being returned for a second
consecutive term.
Opinion polls have shown that after a mid-term slump, the PNP's electoral
support has again surpassed that of the opposition Jamaica Labour Party. Mr
Patterson's decision is also being influenced by the internal problems of
the JLP where Mr Edward Seaga, the party leader, has been at odds with some
of his lieutenants over the past two years.
The government's political stock has also been improved by an appearance of
stability in the economy over the past ten months, after depreciation of the
currency and billowing inflation which followed the deregulation of the
foreign exchange market and the floating of the Jamaican dollar.
Inflation for the first nine months of the current fiscal year was 17.9 per
cent, against 73.1 per cent for the similar period of the last fiscal year.
Although he has not confirmed the reports that he is planning an early
election in the Caribbean island of 2.3m people, Mr Patterson has indicated
his intentions in moves which are expected to lift the ruling party's
popular support.
The income tax rate was cut last month from 33 per cent to 25 per cent, and
import duties on motor vehicles were significantly reduced. The government
has also announced several road building projects costing millions of
dollars, with work on many of these starting immediately.
The signs have not been lost on the JLP which, like the ruling party, has
been completing its slate of candidates. So convinced is Mr Seaga that Mr
Patterson will call a snap election that the opposition leader has announced
that his party's campaign will start next week. This has been proceeded by
well publicised walkabouts by Mr Seaga and the dissidents who had rebelled
against his leadership of the JLP, including Mr Pearnel Charles, a former
deputy leader.
The big issue in the campaign will be the government's handling of the
economy, particularly its decision to deregulate extensively, giving greater
play to market forces while divesting several state-owned economic
enterprises. The JLP has raised questions about aspects of the government's
economic policies, claiming that it has gone overboard in its enthusiasm for
market forces, and has pointed to what it says is the absence of any
significant new investments which the government said its economic policies
would encourage.
The expansion of the economy which the government had expected has been
constrained by the poor performance of the bauxite mining and refining
industry because of a weak international market for aluminium. Official
figures on the performance of the economy last year are yet to be published,
but government economists have said the growth in the economy was
'moderate'.
Export agriculture - sugar and bananas - improved slightly, and the main
contribution came from strong growth in tourism, now the main earner of
foreign currency.
There are already indications of party political violence, which has become
a part of Jamaica's election campaigns. In the last election in 1989, both
parties made much of a publicly signed compact against political violence,
and the campaign was less violent than expected.
Already, however, the parties have exchanged accusations over responsibility
for a spate of shootings in one of the poorer sections of Kingston, the
capital.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Clinton hard sell aims to soften nation: The White House has
been preparing the ground for unpalatable policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT CANNOT be said that his country is unprepared for what President Bill
Clinton has to say tonight in his televised State of the Union address to a
joint session of both houses of Congress. Indeed, there has been no advance
marketing of a speech quite like it for the last 12 years.
Just as President Ronald Reagan and his advisers prepared the ground for his
proposals on February 19 1981 to cut taxes and government spending, so has
Mr Clinton. Just about everybody who works for the president has followed a
similar script, especially now that extraneous issues, such as the search
for a new attorney-general and the debate over gays in the military, no
longer compete for attention.
The only difference, and it may be crucial, was that Mr Reagan was offering
the sort of medicine most people like to take, while Mr Clinton will try to
force some less palatable prescriptions down the nation's throat.
Nevertheless, on national television on Monday night Mr Clinton told the
country that to support what he would propose - to bear some of the pain
today in order to enjoy a better tomorrow and to frustrate the evil designs
of special interests - was nothing less than 'patriotism'. It could have
been vintage Reagan, coming from the mouth of a man who looked a third of
the old gunslinger's age.
The address, Saturday's radio broadcast and last week's televised town
meeting and the haranguing of and exhortation to business leaders constitute
the populist side of the selling of the programme. Later this week the
president and his Cabinet will fan out across the country to drive home the
message.
But there has been some tough selling in Washington too. Hardly a day has
passed without congressional delegations having their ears bent by the
president, his wife, and his staff or without members of the Cabinet
pontificating on television.
Policy kites on Medicare for the elderly, social security and other taxes
have been flown around Washington as if every day was windy. Some have
seemed aerodynamically unsound but others have probably been sent aloft
deliberately to be shot down and thus make alternatives more attractive.
Equally, to show he is capable of leading from the front and to drive home
the cause of 'shared sacrifice', Mr Clinton has announced a 25 per cent cut
in his White House staff and an extensive programme to eliminate government
waste.
The president's strategic approach is clear. He knows he must deal with
Congress, and that the Democratic majority in the legislature does not
guarantee obedience. Thus he will seek to create his own political
relationship with the country-at-large.
His early problems in Washington notwithstanding, there remains plenty of
polling and anecdotal evidence that the country wants Mr Clinton to succeed.
Having elected him into office because of the state of the economy and the
size of the federal budget deficit and national debt, it is looking forward
to him putting his presidential money where his candidate mouth was.
The big change since last November is in the growing evidence of economic
recovery which, in turn, has led many economists and the markets to conclude
that the stimulus elements in Mr Clinton's proposals ought to be toned down.
However, true to his campaign promises and partly reflecting a conviction
that even in recovery the economy is still not creating enough jobs, there
is likely to be about Dollars 30bn (Pounds 21.1bn) in additional public
works spending and investment tax credits. This will be offset by generally
higher taxes on incomes and on commodities such as energy, and by additional
cuts in government spending.
This approach lends itself to easy criticism from Republicans. Mr Robert
Dole, their leader in the Senate, has already dismissed the Clinton package
as yet another variation on traditional 'tax and spend' Democratic policies.
But the Republican ability to frustrate the president may be more apparent
than real, if for no other reason than that the party cannot be seen as
perpetuating Washington 'gridlock'.
Other special interests in the Washington power structure may work their
wills more deviously, but more effectively, on integral parts of the new
proposals as the legislative battle unfolds.
Pre-emptively, Mr Clinton warned on Monday night that 'within minutes of the
time I conclude my address to Congress the special interests will be out in
force. . . many have already lined the corridors of Congress with
high-priced lobbyists.'
What he did not say, naturally enough, is that not every lobbyist is a
chartered member of the 'Gucci gulch' club representing only corporate and
trade interests. Many work for those constituencies - the poor, the elderly,
and the family farmers - which voted for Mr Clinton but which could suffer
from any serious budgetary cuts.
Having raised the rhetorical stakes so high and having painted apocalyptic
visions of the future if problems are ducked, it is also up to Mr Clinton to
deliver proposals that not only can be sold but are credible and tough.
The suspicion still exists, mostly in Washington, that this is a president
whose analytical abilities are greater than his determination to proceed
with the unpopular. Tonight he is going to tell the middle classes, to whom
he promised lower taxes last year, that they will have to pay more. Making
it stick will not be popular.
Twelve years ago Mr Reagan made the reverse pitch and in the end won much of
what he wanted, partly because the consensus for the change he advocated was
there and partly because the opposition faded into insignificance after the
president was wounded in an assassination attempt.
There are differences today - in the relative performance of the economy and
in the lack of real national consensus about what should be done. Still, on
Monday night Mr Clinton again sounded like Mr Reagan when he said his
approach was 'just common sense'. But then he added: 'In the 26 days I've
been your president I've already learned that here in Washington common
sense just isn't too common.'

ANY proposal to have President Bill Clinton appear before the US House of
Representatives to answer questions in the British parliamentary tradition
would require further study, US congressional leaders said yesterday,
Reuters reports from Washington.
House Speaker Thomas Foley told reporters there would be no invitation for
such an appearance this week following Mr Clinton's address to a joint
session of Congress on the economy tonight.
The idea was suggested by Mr Richard Gephardt of Missouri, House majority
leader, who said Mr Clinton should visit the House and answer questions
about his economic programme.
But Mr Foley said the unprecedented step was an idea for the future that
'requires further study and analysis'. He said Mr Gephardt concurred with
this position.
The White House has said Mr Clinton was considering the idea.

CIVIL rights activist the Rev Jesse Jackson yesterday urged President Bill
Clinton to end the crisis over Aids-infected Haitians quarantined at a US
Navy base, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Jackson is on hunger strike in sympathy with 267 Haitians infected with
the HIV virus that causes Aids who are quarantined at the US naval base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
'Mr Clinton's policy on Haiti is a sound one - restore democracy, return
(exiled Haitian President Jean Bertrand) Aristide, but delaying becomes
denial,' Mr Jackson said.
'There must be a sense of urgency about restoring democracy because if you
restore democracy quickly then you end the crisis around Guantanamo Bay and
the embargo (against Haiti) and the blockade, as well as the mass exodus'
from Haiti, he said on US television.
Mr Jackson said he would continue his hunger strike for at least this week
and might try to enlist more hunger strikers unless there is action on the
Haitian situation.
'It's a kind of leprosy island, and there they are desperate, they're in the
dark and they're dying,' he said.
He called on Clinton to address the Haiti situation in his speech tonight
before a joint session of Congress.
Mr Clinton has said he wants to lift the immigration prohibitions preventing
people with Aids from entering the US, but has taken no action.
Overall, Clinton has in effect adopted former President George Bush's policy
on Haiti to return fleeing Haitians to their island homeland but he has sent
emissaries there to try to restore democracy.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Ex-Soviet Union grain debts to US mount
</HEADLINE>

RUSSIA'S mounting defaults on its US agricultural loans are promising to add
to the cost of US farm subsidy programmes and make them a more visible
target for the Clinton administration's effort to cut the budget deficit.
The states of the former Soviet Union, including Russia, have piled up
defaults of Dollars 305.5m (Pounds 215m) on US-government guaranteed grain
loans, having stopped paying interest in late November, the Department of
Agriculture said yesterday,
With little sign of movement in multilateral debt negotiations, the payment
gap could widen to Dollars 4.2bn, the total in short-term grain and
foodstuffs loans the US Department of Agriculture has extend to CIS
countries.
To date, most banks writing the guaranteed loans have been willing to carry
the defaults on their books, hoping debt restructuring would bring full
payment. Only one, Banque Indosuez, has filed claims with the department to
recover lost interest payments on Russian grain loans.
The amount, Dollars 354,000, is tiny compared to outstanding defaults and,
because not all of the interest was guaranteed, the department has paid out
only Dollars 187,000 to the bank.
However, with US farm subsidy payments promising to top Dollars 17.1bn in
fiscal 1993, double the 1992 outlay and the highest seen by Washington in
several years, Russia's loan problems will only add to the farm-support
debate. Lawmakers from urban areas argue that farm subsidies have grown as
farm population has fallen, propping up the income of a rural elite.

JAPAN'S trade surplus rose by 39.4 per cent to Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.7bn)
last month, the government announced yesterday, just days after the new US
administration called upon Japan to boost domestic demand to increase
imports.
The sharp increase in the surplus, which was well above expectations, was
mainly due to a 6.4 per cent fall in the value of imports which outweighed a
0.8 per cent rise in the value of exports.
The Japanese government's sensitivity over the figures was underlined by a
highly political delay in their publication. They had been originally
scheduled for publication last Friday, when Mr Michio Watanabe, foreign
minister, met senior officials of the Clinton administration in Washington.
The finance ministry blamed the delay on a discrepancy between computer
figures from the customs department and findings of the ministry's survey of
trading companies.
The rise in the surplus will raise pressure on the ruling Liberal Democratic
party to augment the 1993 budget with an emergency package to stimulate the
economy.
The sluggish state of both consumption and investment was underlined by
figures showing a 6.5 per cent fall in Tokyo department store sales last
month compared with January 1992, a 38 per cent drop in industrial machinery
orders and a 35 per ent fall in orders received by the top eight
manufacturers of machine tools.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Landmark Tower rises amid Japan's property glut: A market
haunted by a worsening over-supply of office space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT ARCS up over the elevated highway that passes along Yokohama's waterfront
 -70 stories of pristine post-modernist architecture. The Landmark Tower,
the tallest building in Japan, is set amid 70 hectares of reclaimed land and
disused docks, criss-crossed by empty new roads and abandoned railway
tracks.
The Tower was conceived in the late 1970s, financed during the bubble
economy of the late 1980s and it will be finished just in time to join the
worst glut of office space Japan has ever seen. When it was started in the
late 1980s, the space was three times oversubscribed. With the opening due
this summer only 50 per cent of the offices has been rented out.
The glut is increasing every day as long-planned buildings are completed in
Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, the main cities, and threatens to depress rents and
commercial land prices for years to come. The property market will be
haunted by an oversupply of office space for at least five years.
The consequences could be devastating for property developers, many of whom
have been driven to the verge of bankruptcy by the worst slump in Japan's
residential land prices since 1945.
The property companies' troubles means bad debts are likely to continue to
flow into Japan's severely weakened banks. The bank's weakness could in turn
limit their ability to lend to finance the economy's recovery.
There is some good news for the banks. The residential real estate market is
reviving. At the peak in 1987, residential land prices in the three main
cities of Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya rose by 33 per cent, followed by a further
22 per cent rise the following year.
Last year they have fallen by about 15 per cent after a 4.2 per fall last
year. In some central Tokyo areas such as Setagaya and Yokohama the fall has
been about 59 per cent.
Lower prices have brought houses within reach of first-time buyers with
average earnings, prompting a sharp increase in construction work on owner
occupied homes, up about 11 per cent in the first nine months of last year
year.
Sales of the cheapest condominiums worth Y40m (Pounds 234,000) or less are
higher than they were in either 1990 or 1991, whereas sales of apartments
which are more expensive than this are down. Tokyo's stock of unsold
condominiums is six times greater than during the height of the boom in
1987. The Nomura Research Institute estimates this oversupply has reduced
prices to a point where there could be a mini-boom in sales of cheaper
apartments.
Yet the grounds for optimism are limited. Sales of the most expensive
apartments, which were built by speculators, are still sluggish. This unsold
stock will hang over the market for years.
Prices outside the main cities are only just starting to fall. The increase
in sales of cheaper housing may not help the banks as their vulnerability is
to the speculative real estate lending which went into luxury condominiums.
Sales in these expensive apartments are likely to remain sluggish for at
least a year.
Mr Jun Konomi, NRI's real estate analyst, expects residential land prices
will be depressed for at least three years after falling by a further 10 per
cent in the next year.
However, the banks' relief that an end to the fall in residential land
prices may be in sight will be short lived. Prices in the commercial sector
are about to plunge as the centre of Tokyo develops its first ever glut of
unsold office space.
The figures are alarming. In the last two years projects amounting to 4,679
hectares of office space were started in Japan, with about 2,300 hectares in
Tokyo and Osaka.
Over the next four years about 5.4m square metres of office space is planned
within Tokyo alone.
This extra space will be hitting the market just as the main client - the
financial services industry - is cutting back on staff to reduce costs.
This oversupply is yet to be reflected in official figures for office rents
and commercial land prices because they are based on publicly quoted prices
which bear little relation to the deals which tenants and owners do behind
closed doors.
Mr Yasu Ohno, Sumitomo Trust's Bank's long-serving real estate analyst,
believes unofficial rents are often 40 per cent below published prices.
Mr Konomi at NRI estimates that these lower rents mean commercial land
prices in most of central Tokyo should fall by between 30 per cent and 40
per cent after an initial fall of about 7 per cent this year.
Such a slump in the commercial property market can only be extremely
worrying for the banks. The 21 top banks reported a 54 per cent increase in
non-performing loans to Y12,300bn in the six months to the end of September.
That largely reflects the deterioration of the residential property market.
The looming slump in the commercial market is certain to sharply increase
the banks burden of non-performing and rescheduled loans.
Most of the excess Tokyo office development is within spitting distance of
the city's Otemachi financial centre district. It can be little consolation
to the banks' senior executives that they will be able to watch one of the
reasons for their mounting bad loans build up each day before their very
eyes.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Manufacturers to prune product ranges to cut costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE manufacturers are turning their backs on one of the key ingredients
in their business philosophy of the last decade - that their international
competitiveness depended upon producing ever wider ranges of products at an
ever quickening pace.
Surveys by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry show that, in
the last year, Japanese makers of electrical goods and home appliances have
begun to prune their product ranges and extend model life cycles in an
effort to cut costs.
The moves suggest that the pace of competition US and European companies
will face from Japanese manufacturers is lessening.
Most Japanese companies, hit by a combination of falling demand and rising
labour and investment costs, are facing their third year of falling profits
. Electrical retailers are offering huge discounts on electrical goods.
The change in strategy in part reflects official guidance. The Ministry of
Trade and Industry has been urging manufacturers to trim their often
bewildering array of products to cut costs.
The surveys found that the 10 leading manufacturers of televisions expect to
produce 192 different types of television this March, about 10 per cent
fewer than in March last year.
There will be even sharper cuts in product ranges of video recorders,
washing machines and vacuum cleaners.
Nine companies which make video recorders told Miti the number of product
types would be cut by 25 to 72 in the year to this March. The range of
washing machines made by eight leading companies will be reduced by about a
fifth to 101, while the number of different types of vacuum cleaners will be
cut by almost a quarter to 79.
Much more modest cuts are planned for the range of video cameras, down 3 to
20 and refrigerators, down 9 to 138.
The only consumer electronics good to have its product range expanded is the
microwave oven.
The surveys found that although the turnover of products is still rapid, the
product life cycle is slowly being extended to cut engineering and
development costs.
The average model life cycle for televisions has been extended by two months
to 14 months, while the video recorder life cycle is now about 12 months, an
increase of two to three months.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Chinese likely to agree on Hong Kong talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and China are expected to announce this week that they will hold
talks on Hong Kong's future political development.
At a meeting of Governor Chris Patten's Executive Council yesterday, his top
advisory body agreed to defer temporarily the introduction of a bill in the
Legislative Council (Legco), the colony's law-making institution. The bill
would give effect to Mr Patten's plans for broadening the democratic
franchise in elections due next year and in 1995.
It is unlikely, however, that the talks herald a change in China's
opposition to Mr Patten's plans. Beijing's overture was seen in Hong Kong as
an attempt by China to slow down the process of Legco ratification.
The negotiations about talks have been conducted in Beijing by Sir Robin
McLaren, Britain's ambassador, and senior Chinese government officials. The
two sides are still working out the details.
It was unclear last night what the scope and duration of the talks would be.
Barring last-minute hitches, they are expected to be announced by Friday. Mr
Patten's legislation is not expected to be discussed.
Beijing's decision to request talks has placed Mr Patten and the British
government in a difficult position. Mr Patten, who has called for dialogue
with China since he announced his proposals last October, could face a
strong backlash in Hong Kong if he refused to talk.
However, few in the Hong Kong administration believe that China's 11th-hour
agreement to talks is anything but a tactical manoeuvre to prevent Mr
Patten's legislation from being introduced into Legco.
The governor has been receiving conflicting advice as to whether he should
introduce legislation while talks are in progress or wait until they finish.
Britain's Foreign Office was strongly of the view that presenting the bill
to Legco while talks were under way would be unacceptable to China.
Deferral of the bill would be likely to draw stiff criticism from Hong
Kong's pro-democracy politicians. Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United
Democrats, said that while he welcomed the prospect of talks, he saw no
reason why Mr Patten should delay the bill's introduction into Legco.
However, deferral of the legislation would probably be welcomed by Hong
Kong's conservative politicians, who have been advocating such a policy.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Key meetings may determine S Africa power-sharing deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO key meetings this week could determine the fate of the recent
power-sharing deal between the South African government and the African
National Congress.
The ANC's policy-making national executive committee is meeting to decide
whether to ratify the deal, and government is due to open talks with the
mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party today to try to sell power-sharing to the
country's third largest political group.
Both meetings could delay installation of a multiracial interim government,
or prevent it altogether.
ANC negotiators were confident that they could persuade the organisation's
national executive to formalise an outline agreement reached with the ruling
National party last week, calling for power-sharing until the end of the
century. The national executive, which began its meeting yesterday, is due
to take its decision by tomorrow night. The executive is also expected to
consider calling for the lifting of sanctions against South Africa.
Several of the ANC's regional leaders, including the firebrand Natal leader,
Mr Harry Gwala, are known to oppose power-sharing, and many other executive
committee members are believed to feel that a five year 'sunset clause'
before majority rule is too long. Last year the national executive broadly
endorsed the principle of power-sharing - though not for the long period now
envisaged - but only after a bitter fight between ANC radicals and
moderates.
Later today the same power-sharing deal will be debated at a meeting between
government and the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who
has already sharply condemned the agreement. Government negotiators will try
to persuade Inkatha that the power-sharing deal would meet its demand for
devolution of power to regions.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Judge rejects KIO appeal over Dollars 5bn Spanish losses

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAIT Investment Office, the external investment arm of the Kuwaiti
government, was dealt a serious blow yesterday by a Spanish judge who turned
down a KIO appeal against a decision not to open a criminal investigation
into the actions of former KIO managers in Spain.
The KIO's new management has accused its predecessors and some Spanish
associates of losing more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) in Spain since
1986 and claims they stole Dollars 1bn through Grupo Torras, the KIO holding
company in Spain.
Last month Spain's senior judge in economic matters, Mr Miguel Moreiras,
refused to allow the KIO to bring criminal charges against Sheikh Fahad
al-Sabah, former chairman of the KIO, Mr Fouad Jaffar, former KIO general
manager, Mr Javier de la Rosa, who managed the KIO's investments in Spain
and five Spanish associates. Judge Moreiras said then the KIO suit contained
'no evidence' of criminal wrongdoing.
Judge Moreiras said yesterday the KIO's lawyers had no new evidence and had
'not known how to, or not been able to, focus their accusations into any
known crime'. The high court in Madrid has to approve Judge Moreiras' two
rulings in the KIO case so far but it would be a judicial sensation if they
were overturned.
The rejection of the appeal will probably encourage the KIO's new management
to begin judicial proceedings elsewhere, possibly in London.
Until now, the campaign against the former managers has resulted only in the
collapse of the Spanish businesses. In the process, however, Kuwait's
finances have been opened to close international scrutiny for the first time
and, if the new management is unable to prove its allegations of fraud and
conspiracy to steal, some believe Kuwait's credibility in world financial
markets will suffer.
Mr Javier de la Rosa, the former manager of KIO investments in Spain, said
yesterday he intended to sue KIO officials for Dollars 150m for defamation.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Taiwanese visit upsets China
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Chinese government has complained to Japan over the arrival in Tokyo
yesterday of Chien Fu, the first Taiwanese foreign minister to visit in two
decades.
Mr Chien has arrived on a tourist visa for a four-day 'private' visit, but
Beijing has taken his presence as an unwelcome sign of a growing Taiwanese
diplomatic profile.
China is concerned that several countries have recently appointed senior
diplomats to head unofficial missions in Taipei, the Taiwanese capital, at
the same time as the island's independence movement is gathering momentum.
While Mr Chien is not scheduled formally to meet Japanese government
officials, he is likely to meet senior officials of the ruling Liberal
Democratic party at a parliamentarians' function this evening.
A Japanese government official said China's foreign ministry lodged a
protest with the embassy in Beijing, noting that the issuing of any visa to
Mr Chien is a de facto recognition of his role as foreign minister.
The Nationalist Chinese government in Taiwan still claims to be the
legitimate Chinese government, which makes Mr Chien the 'Chinese foreign
minister'.
However, Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and opposes any foreign
recognition of the island's government.
'We knew that Mr Chien's visit was a sensitive matter for China, but we have
explained to them that this is a private matter and that he is here as a
tourist. We are not surprised that they have complained,' a foreign ministry
official said last night.
The visit by Mr Chien is the first by a Taiwanese foreign minister since
1972, when Japan recognised the government in Beijing and severed links with
Taipei.
Instead of an embassy, Taiwan maintains an 'Economic and Cultural
Representative Office' in Tokyo.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Japanese urban farmers turn their hands to property
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S urban farmers have fuelled a sharp rise in house building over the
past year by turning their hands to property development, writes Charles
Leadbeater.
These would-be-property developers are the main force behind last year's 17
per cent increase in apartment building, which is one of the brightest spots
in an otherwise depressed economy.
Large swathes of Japan's big cities are still reserved for agriculture,
mainly rice paddies and fruit trees. About 13 per cent of Tokyo's land is
classified as farmland, worked by about 300,000 families. It is estimated
that about 500,000 homes could be built upon this land.
A surge in apartment building in cities over the past year is largely due to
urban farmers turning over their land to housing to take advantage of the
tax changes of September 1991. These changes affected the capital gains tax
on land sold for residential development and lowered the tax exemptions for
farmers who promised to farm their land for at least 10 years.
As the farmers want to hold on to their land holdings they have built
apartments for rent rather than condominiums for sale. The farmers have been
queueing to borrow money from the official Housing Loan Corporation to
finance their development plans. At their peak last year loans from the
corporation were rising at a rate of about 600 per cent annually.
A report by Credit Suisse securities says there is no sign of land prices
bottoming out yet and an additional fall of between 10 per cent and 30 per
cent is still possible in big cities.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S conservative opposition took a commanding lead over the ruling
Labor party during the first week of campaigning for the federal election on
March 13.
According to a Newspoll opinion poll published yesterday in The Australian
newspaper, support for the conservative Liberal/National party coalition
increased during the week by 3 percentage points to 48 per cent.
Support for the government fell by half a percentage point to 39.5 per cent,
giving the coalition a lead of 8.5 points. A swing of 0.9 per cent is needed
for a conservative win.
Newspoll said the results suggested the conservative parties would win by
53.5 per cent to 46.5 per cent after the distribution of preferences under
Australia's preferential voting system.
This would give the conservatives a majority of around 30 seats in the
147-seat House of Representatives, and make the coalition the largest
grouping in the Senate.
Worryingly for the government, 50 per cent of voters said they expected the
coalition to win, against 29 per cent who expected a Labor victory. Only 55
per cent of committed Labor supporters expected the government to win.
The poll indicates a less emphatic conservative lead than a poll last week
in The Age newspaper in Melbourne, which estimated the coalition lead at 12
points. However, Newspoll has a reputation as an accurate poll.

FT  17 FEB 93 / S Africa deal on sharing power in balance

<TEXT>
TWO key meetings this week could determine the fate of the recent
power-sharing deal between the South African government and the African
National Congress.
The ANC's policy-making national executive committee is meeting to decide
whether to ratify the deal, and government is due to open talks with the
mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party today to try to sell power-sharing to the
country's third largest political group.
Both meetings are likely to prove difficult, and could delay installation of
a multiracial interim government, or prevent it altogether.
ANC negotiators were confident that they could persuade the organisation's
national executive to formalise an outline agreement reached with the ruling
National party last week, calling for power-sharing until the end of the
century. The national executive, which began its meeting yesterday, is due
to take its decision by tomorrow night. The executive is also expected to
consider calling for the lifting of sanctions against South Africa.
Several of the ANC's regional leaders, including the firebrand Natal leader,
Mr Harry Gwala, are known to oppose power-sharing, and many other executive
committee members are believed to feel that a five year 'sunset clause'
before majority rule is too long. Last year the national executive broadly
endorsed the principle of power-sharing - though not for the long period now
envisaged - but this was accomplished only after a bitter fight between ANC
radicals and moderates.
Later today the same power-sharing deal will be debated at a meeting between
government and the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who
has already sharply condemned the agreement. The two sides are due to meet
for three days at a secret venue in northern Zululand. Government
negotiators will try to persuade Inkatha that the power-sharing deal would
meet its demand for devolution of power to regions. Inkatha, which has a
strong regional base in Natal but little support elsewhere, insists that a
new constitution provide for strong regional governments.
Natal has been the scene of some of the worst violence between ANC and IFP
supporters.
Nearly 8,000 people have died since President FW de Klerk started to
dismantle apartheid three years ago.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Judge rejects KIO appeal over losses in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID, KUWAIT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAIT Investment Office, the external investment arm of the Kuwaiti
government, was dealt a serious blow yesterday by a Spanish judge who turned
down a KIO appeal against a decision not to open a criminal investigation
into the actions of former KIO managers in Spain.
The KIO's new management has accused its predecessors and some Spanish
associates of losing more than Dollars 5bn in Spain since 1986 and claims
they stole Dollars 1bn through Grupo Torras, the KIO holding company in
Spain.
Last month Spain's senior judge in economic matters, Mr Miguel Moreiras,
refused to allow the KIO to bring criminal charges against Sheikh Fahad
al-Sabah, former chairman of the KIO, Mr Fouad Jaffar, former KIO general
manager, Mr Javier de la Rosa, who managed the KIO's investments in Spain
and five Spanish associates. Judge Moreiras said then the KIO suit contained
'no evidence' of criminal wrongdoing.
Judge Moreiras said yesterday the KIO's lawyers had no new evidence and had
'not known how to, or not been able to, focus their accusations into any
known crime'. The high court in Madrid has to approve Judge Moreiras' two
rulings in the KIO case so far but it would be a judicial sensation if they
were overturned.
The rejection of the appeal will probably encourage the KIO's new management
to begin judicial proceedings elsewhere, possibly in London. These managers
have been running the KIO for about nine months now, most of which have been
taken up with denouncing the KIO's Spanish investment drive.
Until now though, the campaign against the former managers has resulted only
in the collapse of the Spanish businesses. In the process, however, Kuwait's
finances have been opened to close international scrutiny for the first time
and, if the new management is unable to prove its allegations of fraud and
conspiracy to steal, some observers believe Kuwait's credibility in world
financial markets will suffer.
Judge Moreiras obliquely criticised the KIO and its lawyers for trying to
drum up publicity in the Spanish media. 'There is no legal way of taking
into account the spectacular nature (of the accusations),' he said, 'and
they are viewed independently of the notoriety they have achieved.'
The state of the KIO's investments in Spain has become the focus of a heated
debate in Kuwait, with the new parliament demanding greater controls over
finances. A parliamentary delegation is investigating the scandal. Two
Kuwaiti members of parliament retained their seats with increased majorities
in a second round of polling held because of suspected voting irregularities
in the October general election, Reuter reports from Kuwait.
The constitutional court ordered the rerun after claims that troops and
police, barred from voting by the constitution, took part in the poll.

FT  17 FEB 93 / A TV tale of licence and licensing: Kevin Brown watches the
final episodes of a soap opera in the Australian media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S television moguls are enmeshed in a soap opera more bizarre than
anything on the small screen. The plot involves politicians, big business
and struggling entrepreneurs. And the final episode, expected shortly, could
seriously embarrass the government.
The story began in November, when parliament approved the federal Labor
government's plans for the introduction of subscription television services.
It provided for two 4-channel commercial licences, and a 2-channel licence
for the state-run Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
As an afterthought, the act also allowed the use of fibre optic cable or
multi-point distribution systems by microwave (MDS) technology. 'There will
be no restriction on the use of other technologies to deliver pay TV, such
as cable or microwave,' Senator Bob Collins, the communications minister,
told parliament. It is not clear whether Mr Collins realised that MDS could
compete with satellite services.
But the potential was spotted by some small media entrepreneurs, including
Mr Steve Cosser, a former managing director of the Channel Ten commercial
network, and Mr Kerry Stokes, a Western Australian publisher. By the end of
January, Australis Media, Mr Cosser's private company, had acquired 24
microwave channels in Sydney and Melbourne, and was preparing to bid for a
further six in each of Australia's six state capitals.
Australis was also negotiating a partnership with Time Warner, the US
publishing group, and Australian Provincial Newspapers (APN), an offshoot of
Dr Tony O'Reilly's Irish Independent media group.
Mr Cosser's plan was to set up a national subscription service, using
microwave channels for local distribution and a satellite to carry the
signal between cities. But less than 24 hours before the deadline for the
remaining MDS channels, Mr Collins announced that the auction had been
abandoned. He also instructed the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA),
the independent regulatory body, not to issue licences to owners of
microwave channels.
Mr Collins said the ban was necessary to prevent 'inferior' MDS technology
undermining the prospects for satellite transmission. He also claimed to
have acted in response to pressure from the ABC. But a leaked letter from Mr
David Hill, ABC chairman, shows that the government broadcaster told Mr
Collins only three days earlier that it wanted to compete with Mr Cosser in
MDS broadcasting.
Nor does the claim that MDS is 'inferior' stand up to examination. The
technology is in use in more than 20 countries, including in more than 17m
homes in the US.
The government's action has attracted almost universal opprobrium. But Mr
Cosser has an explanation of why Mr Collins changed tack.
He claims that the government was asked to block MDS by Consolidated Press
Holdings (ConsPress), the media group owned by Mr Kerry Packer, Australia's
richest man. Mr Packer, who dominates magazine publishing and owns a
controlling share in Channel Nine, the top-rating commercial television
network, is believed to be planning to bid for one of the two commercial
satellite broadcasting licences.
'Kerry made us an offer, basically to get out of the road or get crushed. We
rejected that offer,' says Mr Cosser. 'I believe that Kerry Packer's people
and other large media players made representations to the government in the
dying days of the tender process, some more forceful than others. But I
don't know what was said, threatened or offered that led to such a dramatic
policy reversal.'
Mr Packer, who rarely speaks even to his own media, has not commented on Mr
Cosser's claims. However, it is clear that both Channel Nine and the
forthcoming satellite services would have faced serious competition if MDS
broadcasting had not been blocked.
In addition, the broadcasting act requires satellite broadcasters to use
newly developed digital compression technology, which may not be available
until 1996, giving MDS operators two or three years to build market loyalty.
Whatever the reasons for his decision, Mr Collins has succeeded in reviving
long-standing criticism of Labor's close relationship with media proprietors
such as Mr Packer and Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, which
controls 70 per cent of daily newspaper circulation.
The decision has also hurt Australia's reputation among foreign investors,
already wary following the last minute blocking of a proposed gold mine at
Coronation Hill, in the Northern Territory, and the government's frequent
policy changes over the sale of the Fairfax newspaper group, eventually
acquired by Mr Conrad Black's UK Daily Telegraph group.
However, the biggest blow to the government may be delivered in the courts,
where it faces litigation on two fronts. In Western Australia, Mr Stokes won
an interim injunction against the government's decision to stop the sale of
MDS channels. The federal court will decide shortly whether the government
has the power to stop the auction.
In Sydney, Mr Cosser claims Mr Collins exceeded his authority in directing
the ABA not to award MBS licences, and is threatening to sue for damages if
the authority refuses his application. The wording of the broadcasting act
suggests that he may win if the case goes to court.
Australis has also lodged a complaint with the Trade Practices Commission,
the competition watchdog, alleging that the commercial television networks
colluded to prevent the company entering the subscription television market.
Such collusion would be illegal under Australian competition legislation.

FT  17 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Indians key into the market for software -
High-skill, low-cost engineers are getting better but there are still
hurdles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ENGINEER at Infosys, an Indian software group, presses a computer key in
Bangalore, south India, and his machine connects directly with the computer
centre of the Holiday Inn hotel chain 12,000 miles away in the US.
Infosys is supplying Holiday Inn with hotel reservation software.
Its other customers include General Electric of the US and Reebok, the
British-owned sports shoe maker, which have bought sales management
programs, and Digital Electric, the US computer company, which ordered
software to control a fleet of 15,000 sales vehicles.
Thanks to satellite technology, engineers in Bangalore can communicate
almost instantaneously with counterparts in the US, Europe and Japan.
Software exports are pouring out of India in ever-increasing volumes, as
more multinationals take advantage of the high-skill low-cost engineers who
are one of India's biggest competitive advantages.
'India is already a great influence on the world software market,' says Mr
Michael Klein, head of the Indian operations of IBM, the US computer group.
'They are getting better all the time. If they continue to get better they
will become unbeatable for the next 10 or 20 years.'
India must overcome many hurdles, if it is to fulfil Mr Klein's prediction.
Its phone and transport networks are inadequate and red tape still hinders
business activities despite economic liberalisation in recent years.
Violence after destruction of the Ayodhya mosque has also disturbed some
foreign companies' plans.
Moreover, there is tough competition from other low-cost software exporters,
including east Asian and east European countries.
But many foreign high-tech companies believe India's engineers are hard to
beat because they speak English, the language of international high-tech
trade, and are trained at some of the best universities in the developing
world.
According to a World Bank-funded report, average monthly wages for
programmers in India are just Dollars 225 (Pounds 158) compared with Dollars
600 in Singapore and Dollars 2,500 in the US.
India is starting from a low base, with less than 1 per cent of world
software output.
Indian software engineers estimate they have a sizeable 12 per cent share of
developing countries' software exports. Exports are expected to reach
Dollars 225m in the year to June 1993 and are growing at an annual rate of
30-40 per cent.
Moreover, success in software is beginning to encourage improvements in the
quality of domestically produced hardware, potentially also a significant
export.
Foreign companies have held back from investing in India, not least because
of the painful experience of IBM, which quit the country in the mid-1970s in
a row with the government over ownership of its Indian subsidiary.
But the economic liberalisation that started in the mid-1980s and that
gathered pace when Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, launched
reforms in 1991, has persuaded multinational companies to reconsider India.
Texas Instruments, the microchip maker, which opened a software centre in
1986, was one of the first to invest. Motorola, Digital Equipment and Intel
have followed.
IBM, because of its past experience, has been one of the later arrivals. It
signed a joint venture with Tata, the industrial conglomerate, last year.
This month it opened an office block in Bangalore and launched three ranges
of computer on to the Indian market.
Mr Richard Gall, managing director of the Indian subsidiary of Texas
Instruments, says: 'India is now a critical part of our design capability.'
Indian-controlled exporters are also winning increasingly complex orders.
Tata Consultancy Services, a Tata group software house and the biggest
exporter, is capable of 'studying' client businesses and 'helping' to design
'one-off' systems. So is Infosys, which is opening marketing offices this
year in Boston, San Francisco and Paris and next year in Dallas and Chicago.
Indian companies believe they are more likely to succeed in producing
customised packages than in competing in the market for packaged software,
which requires far more marketing muscle in developed countries than they
can afford.
Foreign buyers are far more cautious about purchasing Indian hardware.
The partnerships struck so far between multinationals and Indian computer
companies generally involve the export of software.
In return, the foreign group supplies the Indian partner with brand-name
computers and/or kits for sale in India but not for export to other
countries. This helps foreign companies enter the Indian market and Indian
groups to sell top-quality machines.
However, the domestic industry is still protected by high import tariffs,
which restrict sales growth by keeping prices high - above Dollars 2,000 for
a basic personal computer.
Only 110,000 computers were sold in India last year, split among over 20
manufacturers, giving little scope for large-scale cost-efficient
production.
Mr Dick Heimlich, corporate vice president of Motorola, the American
electronics group, says: 'The problem isn't quality standards but costs,
which can be three times higher than in the US.'
Given enough support and a big export order, some Indian hardware suppliers
may make the grade.
Dell Computers of the US, the personal computer maker, has placed an order
for the assembly of printed circuit boards with PCL, a leading Indian
manufacturer, for no less than Dollars 50m. 'That's a breakthrough. It means
they can reach critical mass,' says Mr Gall of Texas Instruments.
But others have yet to follow Dell. Mr Klein at IBM believes it will take
time for Indian companies to meet the company's quality standards. He plans
to start by purchasing low-technology items such as cables and transformers.
For the next few years at least, fortune is likely to favour software
producers. This should work to India's advantage, since software sales are
expected to grow faster than hardware revenues in the global computer
industry.
Moreover, some engineers believe that innovations in software will
increasingly lead hardware development in the future. As Motorola's Mr
Heimlich says: 'The industry is evolving in India's favour.'

FT  17 FEB 93 / World Trade News: US group plans Dollars 40m brake plant in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KELSEY-HAYES, the motor components subsidiary of Varity of the US, is to
invest up to Dollars 40m in a greenfield plant in Europe with an eventual
annual capacity of 1m vehicle anti-skid braking systems.
Mr John Utley, Kelsey-Hayes' vice-chairman, indicated in London yesterday
that Spain, Portugal and the UK had been ruled out as locations for the new
systems plant. Last year, Kelsey-Hayes established a European research,
development and sales headquarters in Frankfurt. However, Germany's high
cost base makes it almost certain that the new plant - a high-technology
centre expected to employ only about 100 people - will be based in France or
one of the Benelux countries. The location is expected to be announced
within two weeks.
Mr Utley said the group had signed two contracts worth Dollars 110m a year
to supply European car makers with the anti-skid systems, starting late next
year.
The move comes as Hayes Wheels International, the group's vehicle wheel
manufacturing operation recently floated on the New York Stock Exchange  -
in which Kelsey-Hayes retains a 46 per cent stake - prepares to sign this
week an agreement to create a joint venture company with Czech steel maker
Ostrava to supply car wheels to both east and west European car makers.

engineering group to build Pounds 200m South African steel plant

<TEXT>
DAVY INTERNATIONAL, part of the Trafalgar House engineering-to-hotels group,
has won the UK's largest export order to South Africa in recent years with a
Pounds 200m contract to supply a complete stainless steel rolling mill.
The order, which will be announced today, is a big boost for Britain's heavy
engineering sector. Most of the equipment will be bought in the UK from
suppliers including GEC in Rugby and Bronx Engineering in the West Midlands.
The contract is for the R3.5bn (Pounds 790m) expansion of the Columbus
stainless steel plant at Middelburg, which will quadruple South Africa's
stainless steel capacity to 500,000 tonnes a year from 1995, and turn it
into the world's sixth largest producer.
The order was won against strong international competition. Mr Fred Boshoff,
chief executive of Columbus, said there had been 'tremendous interest' in
the tenders for the project, with bids from companies in the UK, France,
Germany, Italy, Austria and Japan.
Some of the bids had been very keen, indicating the lean state of the
international engineering industry.
Columbus, for which Davy built the original plant in 1980-1982, is a joint
venture between subsidiaries of Anglo American and Gencor, South Africa's
two mining giants.
The award of the complete hot mill and cold mill facility gives Davy the
responsibility for the design, supply, installation and commissioning of
equipment which will make strip, coil and plate from slabs produced in the
new Columbus melt shop.
This will be supplied by Voest Alpine, the Austrian engineering group, while
Mannesmann Demag of Germany will supply cranes for the project.
In response to local criticism that major contracts were going offshore, Mr
Boshoff said in order to compete internationally state-of-the-art plant was
required and nobody in South Africa had the capability to supply the
integrated steel plant. He noted that Davy and others would be buying many
of their parts in South Africa.
The contract is Davy's biggest since its takeover in 1991 by Trafalgar
House, and comes a month after Davy won a Pounds 100m turnkey contract to
build a new coking oven for Bethlehem Steel in the US.
Financing for the rolling mill contract was arranged by Kleinwort Benson.
The UK merchant bank is raising 15 per cent of the money privately and the
rest is being arranged through the UK's Export Credit Guarantee Department.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPORTANT US private sector advisory panel has called on the Clinton
administration to negotiate a series of specific trade targets with Japan,
aimed at boosting US manufactured exports.
Failure to achieve these 'temporary quantitative indicators' within an
agreed time span would result either in further negotiated measures or US
sanctions, says the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations in
a report to the president.
With the trade community awaiting a cogent Clinton trade policy, the report
is receiving particular attention. It supports only 'restrained use' of
trade sanctions, but says they must be used if trade pacts are violated.
Although US manufactured exports to Japan have increased at an annual rate
of 13.1 per cent since 1989, the rate of increase has slowed dramatically.
The bilateral trade imbalance has become 'a lightning rod politically' in
the US and it may well become a political problem worldwide for Japan, the
report says.
At the start of the Bush administration, the committee recommended a
programme including fiscal and monetary changes. This eventually became the
Structural Impediments Initiative, under which both countries agreed to take
macroeconomic steps to improve the trade balance.
The panel's latest report says Japan has done well with its Dollars 85bn
supplemental budget proposal to stimulate domestic demand. But it urges it
to take further steps to reduce Japanese savings, increase consumption and
discourage anti-competitive business practices.
The US has done less to meet its commitments. Savings and investment have
declined as a percentage of gross domestic product and the budget deficit
has shown no improvement. 'As long as the US economy remains biased toward
consumption and the Japanese. . . . toward production, the US will have a
significant trade deficit with Japan,' the report admits.

FT  17 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Thailand proposes to establish exim bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Thai cabinet yesterday approved a draft bill to establish an export and
import bank, according to Radio Thailand, AP reports.
The measure, expected to be introduced in the next session of parliament in
May, would set up the bank as an arm of the Finance Ministry, free from
commercial banking rules. It would be capitalised at Bt2.5bn (Pounds 67m),
which would be contributed by commercial banks and the Bank of Thailand, and
drawn from foreign exchange profits confiscated from commercial banks for
misconduct.
The governor of the central bank would serve as the exim bank's director for
the first three years to smooth the transfer of some functions.

<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence across the European Community dropped last year to its
lowest level since the deep recession of the early 1980s, a European
Commission survey published yesterday shows.
A picture of continuing economic gloom emerged from capitals across Europe
at the same time as the Commission survey revealed scant prospects for early
recovery.
The Commission's leading economic indicator, which combines calculations for
output and confidence, dropped from 96.3 in November to 96.1 in December,
equal to its previous low in October 1982.
In Paris, a Bank of France survey showed output falling and stocks rising in
most sectors last month and depressed demand throughout the business sector.
Cars and consumer goods were the worst affected sectors.
French exports also slowed and orders were down, reflecting economic
instability in Germany and increased competition from other European
countries because of the comparative strength of the franc.
Some companies put off investment programmes and although employment was
stable in trade and services, it fell in construction and manufacturing.
Official figures released in Rome yesterday showed a further decline in
industrial output, hitting Italy's industrial heartland worst.
Output declined 0.6 per cent last year although the full extent of the
decline was masked by three extra working days last year compared with 1991.
The drop in production began to accelerate after last summer and in December
was 2 per cent down against the same period the previous year, according to
figures released yesterday by Istat, the national statistics institute.
The worst affected sectors were the automotive industry and engineering,
down 11.1 per cent and 7.9 per cent.
Unions said 145,000 jobs were at risk in the northern industrial region.
The Commission survey suggested industrial investment was likely to remain
weak throughout this year after failing to achieve downgraded estimates last
year.
The sentiment indicator would have fallen even further in December, the
survey showed, had it not been for the glimmer of recovery in Britain. But
latest UK official figures yesterday showed manufacturing output fell in
each of the final two quarters of last year.
Britain was the only one of the 12 Community members to show an improvement
in sentiment last year in the Commission survey. In France and Germany the
indicator fell to 97.4 and 95.5, respectively, from November's 97.9 and
96.0. France's indicator is well below October 1982's 98.5. Consumer
expectations, both for their own countries and for the economy as a whole,
were particularly low in Germany, France, Italy and Portugal.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Corruption probe spreads to senior Italian ministry
officials

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO undersecretaries in Italy's Budget and Interior ministries were warned
yesterday that they were under investigation for alleged corruption.
The most prominent, Mr Claudio Lenoci, a Socialist at the Interior Ministry,
is being investigated by Rome magistrates concerning alleged misuse of the
Italian overseas aid programmes. Mr Lenoci, a parliamentary deputy since
1979, was previously in charge of the overseas aid programme at the Foreign
Ministry.
The other undersecretary is Mr Vito Bonsignore, a prominent Christian
Democrat deputy from Turin. He is under investigation over a hospital
contract in the Turin area. He issued a statement yesterday declaring his
willingness to co-operate and denying any wrongdoing. The Turin magistrates'
move follows the arrest of two senior politicians in the regional
administration.
In other developments in Italy's widening corruption scandals, Milan
magistrates leaked details of their interrogation in a Swiss jail of Mr
Florio Fiorini, the former finance director of ENI, the state oil concern.
Mr Fiorini, who is charged with fraudulent bankruptcy, is alleged to have
told the Italian magistrates ENI paid an annual L1.2bn (Pounds 540,000) to
the main political parties throughout the 1970s.
From 1970 to 1980, Mr Fiorini is said to have claimed, ENI paid L40m a month
to both the Christian Democrats and Socialists, with a further L10m to each
of the small Social Democrats and Republican parties. The ENI money, he
claimed, derived from foreign exchange operations profits and had not
affected ENI's finances. These alleged payments stopped in March 1981
following exposure of the P2 secret masonic lodge.
Potentially more damaging in the Fiorini testimony were allegations that ENI
and other entities channelled funds to the Socialist party via a bank
account in Lugano. Until now Milan magistrates have only indicated they were
examining this account, in the name of Mr Silvano Larini, a Milan architect
arrested 10 days ago, for two alleged transfers totalling Dollars 7m from
the late head of Banco Ambrosiano, Mr Roberto Calvi. The transfers were
allegedly made to compensate Dollars 50m worth of loans said to have been
provided by ENI to the troubled bank.
Both Mr Bettino Craxi, who stepped down from the Socialist leadership last
week, and Mr Claudio Martelli, who resigned the Justice portfolio, have been
issued with warrants that they are under investigation concerning alleged
illicit use of this account in the fraudulent bankruptcy of Ambrosiano. Mr
Craxi was also told yesterday he was under investigation for alleged
corruption concerning Milan's municipal energy authority. Mr Craxi has
consistently denied wrongdoing.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday officially denied it had influenced the
decision of three state-controlled financial groups to buy shares in Adidas,
the German sportswear group, from a company controlled by Mr Bernard Tapie,
the controversial minister of urban affairs.
The Finance Ministry said in a formal statement that the government had 'no
knowledge' of the decision by Credit Lyonnais, one of France's biggest
banks, and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and Assurances Generales de
France (AGF), the insurance groups, to participate in the consortium which
on Monday bought Mr Tapie's controlling stake in Adidas.
This denial followed calls for an official inquiry into the deal from the
conservative opposition, which is favourite to win next month's legislative
elections. It comes as the French socialist government's relationship with
state-controlled companies is under the spotlight.
Last month a similar furore broke out after Elf-Sanofi, subsidiary of Elf
Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group, bought Yves Saint-Laurent, the
French fashion house chaired by Mr Pierre Berge, a friend of President
Mitterrand.
Opposition politicians, who promised to privatise many of France's
state-controlled companies including Credit Lyonnais, AGF and UAP in their
election manifesto, also demanded an investigation into the YSL transaction.
Despite the Finance Ministry's insistence yesterday about the independence
of state-controlled companies, the close links between the government and
some public sector companies were highlighted last week when Elf Aquitaine
was ordered to abandon plans to close a unit at Boussens in south-west
France.
The proposed closure would involve transferring 480 jobs from Boussens, a
socialist stronghold, to Elf plants in other parts of France when the
socialists are under attack because of the steep rise in unemployment.
The French Justice Ministry yesterday forbade a judge from investigating the
circumstances in which Mr Pierre Beregovoy, French prime minister, received
an FFr1m (Pounds 125,000) interest-free loan in 1989 from Mr Roger-Patrice
Pelat, the now-deceased financier. The ministry said there was no evidence
to suggest the loan had been fraudulent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH government has been shaken by an official survey showing that
unemployment reached a record 3.05m people at the end of 1992, with nearly
half a million jobs lost during the year. The report said the jobless rate
seemed to be quickening.
The figures put Spanish unemployment at 20.06 per cent, the highest in the
European Community, and will fuel a simmering row in Spain over whether the
EC president, Mr Jacques Delors, was correct to warn recently that Spanish
unemployment could put a brake on the country's progress towards economic
and monetary union.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, said the national statistics institute
survey's results were 'saddening and surprising'.
The figures catch Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's socialist government at
one of its worst moments in more than 10 years in office. An election has to
be held by the end of November and polls show the socialists losing support
to both the Left and Right, with incipient divisions in the party out in the
open.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Europe keeps on tortuous path towards Emu: The latest
finance ministers' meeting, 'a kind of intellectual warming-up exercise for
monetary union'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE meeting on Monday of European Community finance ministers in Brussels
began innocuously enough. First a two-hour TV debate on the European
economy, enlivened only by Irish complaints about the Community's failure to
prevent the devaluation of the punt; and then the usual retreat behind
closed doors.
What followed remains open to interpretation. By some accounts, the
decisions adopted reveal the first public signs that the Maastricht treaty's
timetable for European Monetary Union was slipping. Others inside the
European Commission argue that nothing has changed. Some Emu enthusiasts
even suggest that an early push for monetary union is now more likely than
ever.
The debate centres on the significance of the finance ministers' decision to
accept the European Commission's request to prolong member states' existing
economic 'convergence' programmes to 1996 and to set common standards for
measuring these economic performance targets. Convergence programmes are the
rigorous action plans which aim to reduce inflation, budget deficits and
government debt so that member states economies' 'converge' and qualify as
members of a future Emu club.
Paradoxically, these convergence plans began as an Italian initiative with
no direct relationship to the Emu project. Italy wanted to use
Brussels-approved targets as an external political discipline to justify
unpopular economic belt-tightening at home. Seven EC members followed, each
presenting differing, often contradictory, programmes with varying
timetables (see table). 'It was all very haphazard,' says a senior EC
official, 'a kind of intellectual warming-up exercise for monetary union.'
To be eligible for Emu, a country has under the Maastricht provisions to cut
its government budget deficit to no more than 3 per cent of annual economic
output and government debt to no more than 60 per cent of annual output - or
at least persuade fellow member states it has a realistic chance of meeting
these conditions in future.
Emu enthusiasts argue that extending convergence programmes to 1996 is
important since it gives Germany an extra year to cope with the huge costs
of unification. Germany is in the embarrassing position of not meeting Emu
performance targets for inflation or budget deficits - though it could
reasonably expect to do so after the medium-term tax package planned to
begin in 1995. One EC official said: 'Without Germany, there is no Emu.'
Emu sceptics believe extension of the convergence programme to 1996 and
beyond is a smokescreen, obscuring the fact that a deeper-than-expected
recession means that the convergence criteria are no longer realistic. At
Monday's meeting, there were clear signs of unrest as finance ministers
wrestled with two conflicting aims: the need to pursue deflationary
convergence programmes as well as to fight unemployment and head off what
one senior Italian diplomat described as the risk of people rioting in the
streets.
Fears that the price of monetary union may be too high are not new. Mr
Jacques Delors, Commission President, has long argued that member states
needed to compensate for the deflationary drive to convergence with EC
co-ordinated growth and greater consideration of employment. The EC's
monetary committee - comprising senior Treasury civil servants in the EC -
is now considering how to take greater account of lower-than-expected growth
in measuring convergence. Senior EC officials are admanant this does not
imply either a weakening of the Maastricht convergence criteria or a
'stretch-out' of the timetable for Emu.
Even the most hardened Emu supporters acknowledge an element of bluff. The
convergence programmes are voluntary. Convergence criteria under the treaty
allow an element of discretion. As one EC economist notes, it suits no-one
to utter these truths, because to do so would encourage backsliding among
weaker members and arouse a backlash in Germany which has insisted on strict
performance targets as the price for giving up the D-Mark.
In the end, judgment on which countries are Emu candidates will be
political. The importance of this Monday's skirmish in Brussels was that it
signalled the start of a wider battle on conditions for Emu membership.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMORALISATION and confusion, bordering on 'open mutiny', reign in Germany's
armed forces, because of repeated budget cuts and open divisions within the
government, according an extraordinary public letter to members of the
Bundestag.
The letter, from the principal personnel committee representing all civilian
and military personnel in the Defence Ministry and the Bundeswehr, spells
out for the first time the disillusion in the ranks over drastic cuts in
both personnel and spending ordered since German unification in 1990.
It charges the government with 'chaotic military planning', describing the
latest order for a new review of troop strengths and equipment cuts as
demonstrating 'unprecedented lack of perspective and unbelievable confusion'
at the highest level.
The letter appears to criticise both Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who ordered the
latest round of extra defence cuts, and Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister,
fighting to protect his budget from new inroads, after initially agreeing to
substantial savings. The two erstwhile close allies are clearly at
loggerheads over the defence budget cuts, where savings in the current year
totalling DM863m (Pounds 365.6m) have suddenly been ordered to help finance
the Chancellor's proposed 'solidarity pact' for east Germany.
The letter, described by defence experts as unheard of in the Bundeswehr's
history, says the mood in the ranks, and among civilian personnel, 'ranges
from open mutiny to sullen resignation because of the latest developments'.
Bundeswehr members want to 'know where they stand,' the authors say, because
the whole process of garrison closures, and apparently 'aimless
reorganisations and transfers' have made it impossible for defence personnel
to plan their lives and careers. The latest cuts ordered by Chancellor Kohl,
and a review of troop numbers below the present target of 370,000 by 1995
(against 440,000 today), along with a review of the duration of
conscription, appear to have been the last straw.
The letter says that garrison cuts ordered by Mr Ruhe last week were forced
on him, making further changes in military planning at short notice. If Mr
Kohl has his way, 'there will be another round of decisions in the
foreseeable future, on the structure and size of the Bundeswehr, with
further consequences for civilian employees and soldiers'.

<TEXT>
THE EC's trade and industry commissioners are split on how much protection
to offer the Community steel industry from cheap east European imports.
Sir Leon Brittan, responsible for external trade, and Mr Martin Bangemann,
industry commissioner, will try to settle their differences at today's
meeting of the European Commission, which will decide outline plans of
commercial and financial support to end the EC steel crisis.
The plan, which will be discussed at a special meeting of EC industry
ministers next week, pits the Community's desire to save its steelmakers
against its new policy of freer trade with struggling east European
economies.
Mr Bangemann warned that without a strong support package, as many as four
or five leading Community steel-makers could go bust. But Sir Leon is
worried that overreacting to manufacturers' demands for protection against
non-EC imports could undermine existing free trade agreements with east
European countries.
EC steelmakers are complaining that a comparatively small volume of cheap
steel imported from the Czech and Slovak republics, Hungary and Poland has
dragged down the EC market price, adding to problems caused by overcapacity
and the sluggish economy.
'The present price level is disastrous for everybody,' Mr Bangemann said
yesterday. He wants central and east European governments to impose minimum
prices on exports over three years. If the countries breached those price
levels the EC would impose anti-dumping duties on steel imports. Sir Leon is
likely to insist that any safe-guard arrangements should be reviewed after a
year.
Commissioners will also consider extending volume restrictions on Czech
steel imports to other east European countries. Sir Leon has already
proposed amending the Czech restrictions to allow a greater volume of
imports but harsher tariffs if limits are exceeded.

INTERIOR ministers from 35 European countries yesterday agreed to crack down
on the wave of illegal immigration from east to west which is fuelling
anti-foreigner violence in Germany and elsewhere.
The ministers said organised smuggling of illegal immigrants would be made a
criminal offence across Europe. They also agreed that airlines, as well as
land and sea carriers, should be liable to fines under new rules on the
movement of illegal aliens.
The conference of ministers from east and western Europe follows pressure
for co-ordinated efforts to reduce an increasing flow of illegal immigration
that ministers say has fuelled xenophobia and been exploited by organised
crime.
The ministers agreed to set up special police units and mobile surveillance
forces to a standard model. The governments also agreed to exchange
information and adopt a common code on border checks.
But ministers from several countries including Britain, balked at the German
demand for a common code on repatriation and on sharing the financial
burdens of combating illegal immigration.
The outcome of the meeting yesterday displayed the limits of pan-European
co-operation on paying for immigration. Interests diverge: Germany, Austria,
Switzerland and Sweden have borne the brunt of the influx from eastern
Europe and are pushing for action, while their neighbours to the west are
more concerned about migrants from other continents.
Germany sought yesterday to allay the fears of Poland and the Czech Republic
that they would become part of a 'refugee zone' if Germany turned back more
asylum seekers. Last week, Bonn offered Warsaw DM55m (Pounds 23m) to finance
refugee camps.
Attention will now turn to sub-regional initiatives, particularly bilateral
talks with neighbouring Poland and the Czech Republic.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, German interior minister, yesterday gave early March as
the date for the next round of talks with Poland on financial aid in
exchange for providing transit for rejected asylum-seekers before
repatriation. He also announced talks soon in Prague on a multilateral
approach to expelling illegal immigrants.

FT  17 FEB 93 / German groups to double purchases from the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 30 of Germany's top companies agreed yesterday to double their
purchases of goods from the former East Germany by 1995, in a new move to
revive the collapsed economy.
The 'purchasing offensive' was announced by Mr Carl Hahn, supervisory board
chairman of Volkswagen, in the name of the Federation of German Industry
(BDI), and is backed by all the country's main motor manufacturers, as well
as by the biggest retail and mail-order chains.
It amounts to a new attempt by the business sector to bolster Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's efforts to negotiate a 'solidarity pact' for east Germany, at
a time when parallel efforts to agree on wage restraint are running into
difficulty.
Official arbitration in the state of Saxony between IG Metall, the giant
engineering workers' union, and east German employers, in an effort to agree
on a slowdown in the process of wage equalisation with west Germany, broke
down on Monday night.
Union officials said arbitration will continue in the other four east German
states, but the chances of compromise appear slim. The employers are seeking
to renegotiate a 26 per cent wage rise due to be paid on April 1, to bring
the eastern engineering workers up to 82 per cent of western wages, although
most of their industries are facing imminent closure.
Chancellor Kohl told a meeting of leaders of both sides of industry in Bonn
that agreement in the wage talks remained a key element in efforts to revive
the eastern economy, but he insisted that the partners in the wage talks
must reach an agreement independently.
He persuaded the parties in his ruling coalition yesterday to pay civil
servants a 3 per cent rise this year - the same as that agreed for blue
collar public sector workers - but to delay it until May 1, as their
contribution to the solidarity pact.
At the same time the coalition partners rejected a plan proposed by the
opposition Social Democrats for a 10 per cent tax surcharge on the better
paid to be levied from July 1. They agreed, nonetheless, to negotiate with
the opposition on possible compromises.
Mr Kohl is anxious to demonstrate that his planned solidarity pact is more
than simply a package of budget cuts in the west, and modest spending
increases in the east. To that end the business sector initiative is another
helpful boost.
Mr Hahn said that current purchases from the east totalled just DM24bn
(Pounds 10bn), against eastern purchases from the west running at DM174bn.
The aim was to raise western purchases to DM50bn by 1995, he said.
At the same time he warned that east German manufacturers had to make major
improvements in the quality and quantity of their output, and this depended
on wage rises in the east slowing down to the rate of productivity growth.
Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' organisation, yesterday said it was
prepared to offer a maximum 9 per cent rise to its east German employees, in
view of the fact that productivity levels are about 30 per cent below west
German levels.
'Nine per cent is all we can afford,' said a spokesman.

FT  17 FEB 93 / London braced for widespread hospital closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON faces widespread hospital closures under a government strategy,
announced yesterday, which aimed at the same time to defuse opposition to
the restructuring.
Final decisions on the most sensitive hospital closures recommended in Sir
Bernard Tomlinson's report on London health care will not be made until
after further reviews and consultations later this year.
The announcement by Mrs Virginian Bottomley, the health secretary, does not
amount to a reprieve for threatened hospitals such as St Bartholomew's and
the Charing Cross, even though the government has feared that closing famous
institutions would cause a political storm.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's shadow health secretary, described her statement
as a 'damp squib with a long fuse attached to a powder keg of cuts and
closures'.
Mrs Bottomley made it clear last night that the London restructuring
proposals would not be considered by ministers as a single package again.
Decisions on the future of individual hospitals would be taken separately.
Threatened institutions - faced with fragmented decision-making and an
uncertain timetable - will find it difficult to maintain the high-profile
level of campaigning that preceded yesterday's announcement.
The government has accepted the broad conclusions of the Tomlinson report -
that up to 2,500 inner-London hospital beds should be shed over the next
five years, with resources diverted to family doctor and community services.
Mrs Bottomley announced plans for Pounds 170m capital expenditure on
improving local medical services in inner London during the next six years,
plus Pounds 40m extra revenue expenditure next year.
Several innovations are planned, including the introduction of salaried
general practitioners to improve inner London's family doctor services.
'London deserves the radical overhaul which, over the years, many have
promised but none has delivered,' Mrs Bottomley said.
The long-standing financial problems of the capital's teaching hospitals
have been brought to a head by the 1991 health reforms, which are leading to
health authorities outside inner London treating more patients locally.
Government subsidies of Pounds 50m have been spent on covering the London
hospitals' lost income this financial year, and this is likely to double
next year.
The future of Bart's is highly doubtful. Ministers are considering three
options for the famous City hospital. These are closure; amalgamation with
the Royal London; or scaling down to a much smaller specialist hospital.
The government stressed, however, that a scaled-down specialist Bart's would
need a cost-base acceptable to purchasers in the NHS market.
Prof Michael Besser, chief executive of Bart's, said: 'In essence the
options put forward by the secretary of state suggest that the government is
intent on closing Bart's one way or another.'

FT  17 FEB 93 / Bank warns rate cut would threaten inflation targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England yesterday gave the government a thinly veiled warning
that a further cut in interest rates at present would jeopardise its
struggle to defeat inflation.
In its first quarterly report on inflation, the Bank said that expectations
of inflation are still too high in Britain and the government's target has
yet to win credibility.
It warned that 'further progress is required' to meet the government's
objective of keeping the annual increase in the retail prices index,
excluding mortgage interest payments, in a 1 per cent to 4 per cent target
range in the life of this parliament.
The Bank also said that it expected unemployment to continue rising for some
months and urged wage restraint to prevent further heavy job losses. It had
seen few signs so far of recovery in demand and output.
This gloomy view of the UK economy was borne out yesterday by the latest
government figures for industrial production. These showed that
manufacturing output fell in each of the last two quarters of 1992. Output
of all production industries, including manufacturing, energy and water,
dropped in 1992 for the third year running - the first time this has
happened since the early 1930s.
Although the Bank believes that underlying inflation can stay in a 3 per
cent to 4 per cent range during the next two years, there are risks that the
top level of the target will be breached.
In particular, the Bank warned that 'a sustained further depreciation of
sterling' could cause inflation to exceed the target range. Another problem
was the government's large fiscal deficit and fears that it might be
monetised in the future.
Official figures yesterday put the public sector borrowing requirement at
Pounds 21.6bn in the first 10 months of the 1992-93 financial year in spite
of an unexpectedly high Pounds 3.8bn surplus in January.
Although the Bank is not independent, it was recently given a mandate by the
government to combat inflation. Yesterday's detailed report is a sign that
it takes its duties seriously.
The Bank considers the report an important check on government actions. It
has ensured it gets wide circulation by making it available in leading
bookshops.
The report details how cost pressures have built up in the economy since
sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. It marks out the
government's limited room for manoeuvre by setting its monetary policy in
the context of likely continuing inflation pressures.
While the UK economy is still bumping along the bottom of the recession, the
Bank finds that underlying inflation is too high for comfort.
But Mr John Major last night offered a more optimistic gloss on the economic
outlook. Speaking to an audience of Tory party supporters, the prime
minister hinted that official figures for retail sales due later today would
confirm a sustained upturn in consumer confidence.

FT  17 FEB 93 / UK and Germany in crisis talks on Eurofighter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and Germany are to hold confidential talks this week to try to
resolve a looming funding crisis in the four-nation Eurofighter 2000
aircraft project.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, the British defence procurement minister, will seek
assurances on Bonn's share of payments in discussions over the next three
days with General Jorg Schonbohm, secretary of state responsible for
armaments at the German defence ministry.
The Ministry of Defence said Mr Aitken's visit to Germany, which starts
today, was to attend an Anglo-German seminar in Hamburg and was not
specifically linked to the Eurofighter project. However, the future of the
programme is expected to feature prominently in his discussions with Gen
Schonbohm, which are due to continue during a two-day visit to eastern
Germany.
The discretion surrounding the talks is explained by the UK's anxiety not to
embarrass German officials into making public statements which could worsen
the financial stalemate.
German industry officials said that finance from the Bonn government would
run out in about two months and that some payments were already overdue.
Under work-sharing arrangements between Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain,
each government is responsible for paying its industry for its part in the
Pounds 8bn programme for development of the aircraft.
Failure by Bonn to release more money means that Daimler-Benz's Deutsche
Aerospace subsidiary has to bear the burden of continuing with the project.
There is concern that some German sub-contractors could face severe
difficulties as a result.
A senior British official said the UK regarded the problem as one that
Germany had to resolve. 'It's up to them,' he said.
The financial shortfall calls into question the agreement reached by the
four countries last December to continue with a modified Eurofighter
project, overcoming the threat of German withdrawal. The agreement was based
on cost cuts and a slowing down of development work.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, had already reduced Bonn's 1993
budget allocation to the project by about DM300m to DM520m (Pounds 220m). Of
this, DM180m was owed to industry for work done in 1992. The remaining
DM340m is not expected to cover Germany's share of work beyond April.
Prospects for raising Bonn's funding provisions have been hit by cuts in the
defence budget.

FT  17 FEB 93 / Steep falls in US stocks as Clinton widens tax plan: Bond
markets react positively on deficit hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US STOCK markets fell sharply yesterday as investors took fright at
President Bill Clinton's plans to raise taxes on a far broader range of
taxpayers than expected.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 75 points in the first 90
minutes of business in heavy selling, triggering New York Stock Exchange
rules that limit computerised trading. The restrictions failed to stem the
selling in afternoon trading, and the Dow eventually closed down 82.94 at
3,309.49.
In contrast, the bond markets welcomed Mr Clinton's tough talk on deficit
reduction. The president said yesterday that businesses would be better off
because his plans for reducing the budget deficit would yield lower, more
stable long-term interest rates.
'The bond market's a better indicator, and that response has been very
positive,' he said.
After weeks of floating one idea after another, Mr Clinton warned Americans
in a televised speech on Monday night that he had been unable to find any
way to deal with the growing US federal budget deficit without raising taxes
on the middle class.
He promised that 70 per cent of the new taxes he will propose in a detailed
address to Congress tonight would be paid by those earning more than Dollars
100,000 (Pounds 69,000) a year.
A White House spokesman added yesterday that people making less than Dollars
30,000 were very unlikely to suffer any increase in taxation, while those
earning between Dollars 30,000 and Dollars 100,000 would face 'modest
increases across the board'.
However, it appeared certain that higher income tax rates, which Mr Clinton
promised during his campaign would be limited to the top 2 per cent of
taxpayers, will be levied on much lower incomes.
A new top income tax rate of 36 per cent may be imposed on incomes above
Dollars 175,000, while a so-called 'millionaire's surtax' could be extended
to incomes of Dollars 250,000, in effect creating a top marginal tax rate of
around 40 per cent.
White House officials also confirmed yesterday that they were considering a
second round of tax increases, possibly affecting tobacco, alcohol, guns or
insurance premiums, to pay for the expected Dollars 30bn-Dollars 90bn cost
of extending medical coverage to everyone in a reform Mr Clinton will
propose later in the year.
Republicans have launched an all-out assault on Mr Clinton's economic
programme, saying that he will simply raise taxes without undertaking any
serious attempt to reduce the deficit by curbing government spending.
'All the sacrificing is going to be done by the people pulling the wagon,'
said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas.
Analysts said shares fell sharply because investors were worried that higher
corporate and personal taxes, coupled with spending cuts, might hinder the
economic recovery. The selling also reflected disappointment that the
Clinton fiscal stimulus package will probably not be as big as the markets
had once hoped.
Drug stocks took an especially big beating on concern that the president's
healthcare reforms will regulate pharmaceutical prices and limit drug sales.

FT  16 FEB 93 / The Guiness affair sinks from high drama to a low whimper:
Ward's acquittal marks the end of a scandal that has already passed into
folklore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE acquittal of Mr Thomas Ward yesterday in the third Guinness trial
the curtain has finally fallen on the City's most celebrated financial
scandal of recent years.
Some pieces of unfinished business remain - most notably publication of the
Department of Trade and Industry report on the affair. The report - reputed
to be a distinctly hard-hitting document - is expected to be released soon
and could still have the potential to inflict both embarrassment and damage
in some quarters.
However, the story of corporate corruption that excited unprecedented public
interest and traumatised the City has become a piece of history.
The end of the Guinness affair looked as though it would be reached with
more of a whimper than a bang. The delay in bringing Mr Ward to trial -
mainly because of his fight against extradition from the US - meant the
legal proceedings already had a feel of being long past their sell-by date.
When it began, the trial seemed a dull affair compared with the theatrical
spectacle of the first Guinness trial, which ended with the high-profile
jailing of Mr Ernest Saunders and others.
The determination of the judge to ensure there was no risk of the trial
becoming a Blue Arrow-style disaster, where the scale and complexity of the
trial led to an unprecedented legal debacle, the case was confined to the
very barest of essentials. The charge against Mr Ward was a fairly
straightforward one: of the theft of Pounds 5.2m from Guinness, almost a
'smash-and-grab job' committed after the bid.
Now that the third Guinness trial has resulted in acquittal, the final
outcome - four convictions from seven attempted prosecutions - has to be
seen as a very mixed success for the Serious Fraud Office for whom the
Guinness affair was its first big task.
Yet the Guinness saga will continue to be a critical reference point in
debates on policing the City, the nature of so-called 'victimless crime' and
the problems of corporate governance. For many practitioners the lessons
from the Guinness have long since been learnt.
A City lawyer said: 'People have learnt share support is wrong, that rules
are there to be kept and that reputation is no protection against
prosecution. But to most people the Guinness saga ended when Mr Ernest
Saunders went to jail. It remains a warning against gung-ho behaviour, but
people have long since moved on.'
The first trial, ending with the convictions of all four defendants, was
unquestionably a great success for the SFO and seemed to be a demonstration
of how large fraud trials could be brought.
But the success was to be tarnished. Charges against Mr David Mayhew of
Casenoves had to be withdrawn. The second trial collapsed when Mr Roger
Seelig suffered a nervous breakdown. Lord Spens, his co-defendant,
eventually won an acquittal.
Those failures focused minds again on the many problems of long, complex and
costly fraud trials and provided plenty of material to feed the current
debates on the management of such proceedings.
The judge in the first two trials, Mr Justice Henry, was moved to make
radical suggestions for reform, many of which have been officially
sanctioned in a consultative paper by the Lord Chancellor's Department. The
judge in the Ward trial will make his feelings known today.
The word Guinness may remain in business folklore as a by-word for corporate
corruption, but the company itself has long since put the affair behind it.
Sweeping management changes have restored Guinness's reputation and it has
built on the Distillers takeover to transform itself from a medium-ranked
brewer and ragtail retailer into the most profitable drinks company in the
world.
When Sir Norman (now Lord) Macfarlane, one of the four non-executive
directors which the City forced on Mr Saunders in 1986, took over as
chairman, he brought in Sir Anthony Tennant from Grand Metropolitan as chief
executive. While Lord Macfarlane dealt with the ramifications of the DTI
inquiry, Mr Tennant developed the business, selling off peripheral
operations to concentrate on brewing and spirits.
About six months after his appointment, Mr Tennant invited Mr Tony Greener,
former managing director of Dunhill and one of the new non-executive
directors, to help him restructure Distillers.
They rationalised distribution, increased direct control of marketing,
formed alliances such as that with LVMH, the French luxury goods group,
pushed up prices and margins, and supported the brands with intensive
advertising to restore their premium image.
The new management - not a senior manager survives from the Saunders era -
restored Guinness's reputation for straight dealing and revitalised its
performance. With the benefits of the Distillers restructuring, pre-tax
profits between 1987 and 1991 soared from Pounds 408m to Pounds 956m;
earnings per share grew from 14.7p to 33.6p; and dividends rose from 4.6p to
10.8p.
Although the global recession took its toll last year, the group has
consolidated its long-term growth prospects with a series of acquisitions,
including Asbach of Germany, Bundaberg in Australia, and Pampero in
Venezuela.
When Mr Tennant retired last year, it was an entirely different company from

Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, once designated as successor to Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, has been arrested in Iran after denouncing the country's
current spiritual leader, Mr Abolhassan Bani Sadr, an exiled former
president, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
The arrest followed an attack by armed men on Ayatollah Montazeri's house
last Friday in which three of his aides were killed, Mr Bani Sadr said. His
office said the information came from aides to Ayatollah Montazeri.
Mr Bani Sadr said Ayatollah Montazeri came under attack after denouncing
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the current spiritual leader and Ayatollah Ali
Meshkini, head of the Assembly of Experts which examines legislation.
He said Ayatollah Montazeri had described them as agents of the US Central
Intelligence Agency who had plotted to remove him as Khomeini's successor.

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Paribas banks on a clear break
in the storm clouds - Alice Rawsthorn examines the tasks facing the bank's
chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rue d'Antin, in the banking district of Paris, is clouded by Paribas'
troubles. The bank, still reeling from the shock of posting its first ever
loss, in 1991, is licking its wounds after another bruising year during
which the problems of the French economic slowdown were aggravated by the
scandal over the discovery of FFr1bn (Dollars 178m) of off-balance sheet
dealings at its associate, Ciments Francais.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, the urbane investment banker who has chaired Paribas
since 1990, faces the task of clearing away the debris from the Ciments
Francais debacle and completing the process of restructuring his company.
'We had a tough time in 1992 and 1993 will be another difficult year,' he
said. 'But most of our problems are due to short term factors. We must keep
a long term perspective.'
When Mr Levy-Lang first became chairman his chief challenge was to hammer
out a long term structure for Paribas' labyrinthine mass of banking
activities and industrial investments. Mr Levy-Lang has made some changes by
pruning Paribas' portfolio of industrial investments and rationalising its
retail banking operations outside France.
Paribas is now composed of four divisions:
Banque Paribas, the investment bank which is one of the few French
institutions to be a serious player in the international marketplace
Compagnie Bancaire, the specialised financing company with a strong presence
in property
Credit du Nord, the French retail banking network, and
A portfolio of industrial investments including stakes in 200 companies.
If all had gone according to plan Mr Levy-Lang would now be concentrating on
strategic issues such as introducing Banque Paribas' new international
structure and encouraging cross-referals between the three banking
businesses. These issues are being addressed but he has also faced the
further challenge of repairing the damage caused by the economic squeeze.
All Paribas' banking businesses have been affected by the impact of high
French interest rates, which has dried up demand for credit and recently
produced steep increases in borrowing costs. Meanwhile, Credit du Nord and
Compagnie Bancaire have had to make hefty provisions on their exposure to
the depressed property markets both in France and the UK.
As a result the group went into the red in 1991, with a net loss of FFr184m
after provisions of FFr9.5bn. It clawed back into the black last year with
provisional net profits of FFr900m, but the 'recovery' was mainly due to
asset sales and Paribas still had to make provisions of FFr7.8bn.
But the real trauma of 1992 was the discovery that Ciments Francais - a
French cement company in which Paribas had sold control but was still a
significant shareholder - had made hefty losses on its off-balance sheet
dealings. Mr Pierre Conso, the cement company's chairman, has since resigned
but it plunged into the red with an estimated net loss of FFr1bn last year.
Paribas was left in the acutely embarrasing position of having to repay
FFr500m of the FFr6bn received earlier last year for selling control of
Ciments Francais to Italcementi of Italy. Its share of Ciments Francais
losses for 1992, estimated at FFr500m, will wipe out the remaining profit
from the sale.
Despite the scandal, Mr Levy-Lang maintains that Ciments Francais was still
'a very profitable investment for us over the years'. But the fiasco acts as
an apt illustration of the pitfalls of Paribas' strategy of taking sizeable
stakes in industrial companies as a long term investor, generally without
exerting managerial control.
Mr Levy-Lang accepts that such a scenario could happen again. 'What can you
do if the managers of a company are lying to the board and the auditors?' he
said. However, he is still committed to continuing to develop Paribas'
industrial portfolio with further investments in the future.
He is also keen to return to the more mundane business of engineering
Paribas' recovery.
Like most French bankers he suspects that the market has stabilised,
although the commercial property sector will remain fragile for a few more
years.
Paribas is now concentrating on improving productivity mainly by pooling
specific areas of activity such as cheque processing for the three banking
businesses and custodial functions for Credit du Nord and Banque Paribas.
The group is expected to increase profits this year, albeit slowly, with
Morgan Stanley forecasting modest growth from FFr900m to FFr1.2bn. 'We're
still a few years away from producing the kind of profits I would like to
see,' said Mr Levy-Lang. 'It won't happen overnight, but we'll get there.'

<TEXT>
YVES SAINT-LAURENT, the French fashion house embroiled in a political row
over its recent FFr3.6bn (Dollars 640m) takeover by Elf-Sanofi, the
pharmaceuticals group, yesterday warned of a sharp fall in net profits for
1992.
The group, which is run by Mr Pierre Berge, estimated that its operating
profits fell by about 25 per cent in 1992 - to around FFr384m from FFr512m
in 1991 - with net profits falling 'at a faster rate'.
YSL saw sales fall by 2 per cent to FFr3bn during the year from FFr3.06bn in
1991. The couture division was worst affected with sales falling by 5.5 per
cent to FFr527m.
Under the terms of the Elf deal, a complex share swap arrangement, the
pharmaceuticals group will take control of YSL's perfume and cosmetic
interests, but Mr Berge will continue to run the fashion business with Mr
Saint-Laurent.
Bull, the French computer group, saw sales fall 9.7 per cent from FFr33.45bn
(Dollars 5.95bn) in 1991 to FFr30.18bn last year. However the group did
manage to improve its operating margins during the year.

The City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) hopes to get more than a foot
in the doors of Whitehall with the appointment of its first president, Lord
Clark of Kempston.
Lord Clark's connections after more than 30 years in parliament are expected
to give added weight to Cisco's proposals on smaller company requirements.
The group was launched last year, following Stock Exchange proposals to
dismantle the Unlisted Securities Market, and aims to protect the interests
of smaller companies in the City.
Richard Balarkas, Cisco's chief executive, says Lord Clark's involvement
will allow the group to 'get directly to the ministers involved'.
A former Tory MP with a career stretching back to 1959, Lord Clark, 70, has
served variously as deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, front-bench
spokesman on trade, finance and economics, and chairman of the Conservative
back-bench finance committee. Most recently, Lord Clark was on the committee
investigating alleged malpractices at the Lloyds insurance market. He was
promoted to the House of Lords last year.

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bronfman units cut quarterly
dividends in half
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EDPER Enterprises and Pagurian, two leading holding companies in the
business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, yesterday cut their
quarterly common share dividends in half.
The cuts reflect a thinning stream of dividend income and shrinking cash
resources in the upper layers of the Bronfman group.
Several operating companies, most notably in the real estate and financial
services sectors, have reduced their common dividends in the past year.
Bramalea, a property developer, has halted preferred dividends.
Edper, which is Mr Peter Bronfman's top public company, is reducing its
dividend to 20 cents a share from 40 cents. Pagurian, the main vehicle for
the Bronfmans' senior managers to participate as shareholders in the group,
has cut its dividend to 7.5 cents from 15 cents.
Mr Edward Bronfman, brother of Mr Peter Bronfman, has a minority interest of
19 per cent in Edper.
The top Bronfman companies have also lost an important source of dividend
income with last week's sale of the group's 38 per cent stake in John
Labatt, the brewer. Labatt has recently contributed about CDollars 32m
(Dollars 25.3m) a year to Brascan, its immediate holding company.
The Bronfman empire last week raised almost CDollars 2bn from the disposal
of the controlling block in Labatt and in MacMillan Bloedel, the
Vancouver-based forest products company.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Mrs Fields quits London USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Fields is quitting the London stock market, leaving UK investors in the
controversial USM-quoted cookie company holding heavily diluted stakes in a
private group. Seven years after its debut on the unlisted securities
market, the US-based company said it had no viable alternative to a
refinancing.
The group's four US bankers have agreed to swap Dollars 96m (Pounds 68m) of
debt and preference shares for Dollars 50m in loan notes and a stake of 79.1
per cent.
Public shareholders will be diluted from 19.3 per cent to about 2.4 per cent
following the swap and a one-for-eight consolidation of existing shares. As
a result, Mrs Fields will not meet the regulatory requirements for a USM
listing.
However, a spokesman for the company said investors should 'regard this as a
positive outcome given the circumstances. The reality could have been some
form of administrative receivership.'
The banks intended eventually to sell the business, offering the prospect of
a return at some stage in the future, he said.
The founder and person most publicly associated with the company, Mrs Debbi
Fields, will remain as chairman. However, her stake falls from 18 per cent
to 8.4 per cent. The banks intend to appoint a new board and management
team.
The refinancing was accompanied by a profits statement, the first since
interims in October 1991. In 1992, the group reported a loss before tax and
exceptionals of Dollars 3.6m. Pre-tax losses for the year to December 31,
1991, were Dollars 3.4m, although exceptionals pushed the net loss to
Dollars 87.2m. The company said the exceptional charges related to its shift
towards franchising.
The company said the restructuring was likely to be approved at the
extraordinary general meeting on March 3. Some 80 per cent of the shares had
already been pledged to the banks in previous refinancing efforts.

<TEXT>
ALCATEL, the French telecommunications equipment group, has won contracts
worth Dollars 400m (Pounds 282m) in China through its Spanish and Norwegian
subsidiaries.
The contracts have been signed despite strained Sino-French trade relations
following the sale last year of 60 French Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters to
Taiwan.
Two months ago China ordered France to close a consulate in Guangzhou
province and then banned French companies from tendering for a Dollars 1bn
subway contract in the region.
Alcatel is the world's largest telecommunications equipment supplier and
part of the Alcatel-Alsthom industrial group.
The contracts involve Alcatel Standard Electrica, its Spanish subsidiary, in
two joint ventures with China. One will set up a plant in Chengdu, Sichuan,
to produce voice and data transmission equipment. The second, at Wuhan in
the Hubei region, will make equipment for telephone exchanges.
Alcatel Standard Electrica and Alcatel Telecom Norway, the Norwegian
subsidiary, have also won contracts to supply more than 2m lines of digital
switching in China during the mid-1990s.
The Alcatel group already has substantial interests in China, where it
supplies 40 per cent of all digital telephone switching equipment.

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Hands-on venturers take new
course - The transformation of DCC into a holding company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST DECEMBER, as the minds of Dublin's corporate financiers were focused on
more seasonal matters such as the state of household budgets and the office
party, two deals were suddenly sprung on the market.
Behind them was DCC, a private company founded and headed by Mr Jim Flavin,
a maverick figure who in 16 years has built a local IPounds 1m venture
capital operation into an industrial holding company with pan-European
ambitions and net assets in excess of IPounds 130m (Pounds 135m).
The two December deals involved a total of IPounds 20m being offered to buy
out Wardell Roberts, a health and snack foods company, and Printech, one of
the largest computer documentation printers in Europe.
DCC, and those acting in concert with it, already held 34 per cent and 66
per cent of the two companies respectively. Both offers have since been
declared unconditional.
The offers attracted sharp criticism. They were 'pathetically derisory' and
'represent a threat to the long term viability of the Irish Stock Exchange
if sound second line companies can be taken out like this,' said Mr John
Lawrie, chief investment manager at Scottish Provident.
He believed the lack of a market for second line companies had grossly
undervalued them. Mr Flavin would not disagree, perhaps giving a clue to his
success and to his switch away from venture capitalism.
DCC was responsible for bringing both firms to the stock market. Printech
was admitted to the Official List only in May 1991.
Speaking at his headquarters, set characteristically in leafy suburban
surroundings on the south side of Dublin away from the huddle of corporate
head offices in the overcrowded city centre, Mr Flavin said that a change in
corporate strategy had coincided with a secular downturn in the performance
of the smaller companies quoted on the Irish market.
'Around the end of 1990, we decided that if we were to grow, we would have
to expand outside of Ireland. Given the tough time that venture capital
companies have had in the US and mainland Europe, we felt it would be
difficult to compete in this field. We therefore decided to become an
industrial holding company' he said.
Since then there has also been 'a relative underperformance of smaller
companies' quoted in Dublin, which he said 'has been more savage than the
normal cycle'.
A slowing of funds into the market, combined with the disappearance of
exchange controls and the diversification of institutional portfolios into
overseas equities and gilts has resulted in the market 'doing nothing for
shareholders or the corporate entities concerned', Mr Flavin said.
Although private, more than 90 per cent of DCC shares are held by financial
institutions and pension funds. The largest holders are Bank of Ireland with
20 per cent, and Irish Life Assurance with 13 per cent.
He set up the company in 1976, after managing Allied Irish Banks' venture
capital fund for several years. 'I knocked on the doors of 13 institutions
and received a 'yes' from 11 of them', Mr Flavin said.
He said the new strategy would concentrate on five core areas - food,
healthcare, office automation, printing and energy.
Besides the Printech and Wardell Roberts deals, DCC has bought two thirds of
the 11m Fyffes shares sold by the McCann family last December, taking its
stake to 11 per cent.
Through its 77 per cent holding in Fannin, it has a strong foothold in the
medical and surgical supplies field and the specialist microsurgery sector,
which Mr Flavin sees as strong growth areas.
Through its 30 per cent stake in Flogas, DCC is entering the natural gas
distribution sector in the UK.
In its last full year results DCC reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 13.5m
and earnings per share of 76.5p.
Since 1990, the investment portfolio has been steadily reduced from 42 to 19
companies. In its quest for European expansion, it plans to become a plc
within two to three years.
'We have built up cash from the disposals, but we are seeing a lot of
opportunities to add value and we are thinking of a flotation to build up
the coffers,' Mr Flavin said.
'Five years ago we were predominantly trading in Ireland. Now 60 per cent of
our business is done in the UK. Five years from now I expect 20 per cent
will be in Ireland, 40 per cent in the UK, and 40 per cent on mainland
Europe with some in the US.'
As one of Ireland's leading venture capital companies in the eighties, where
does DCC's change of strategy leave the venture capital sector now?
'I think the Unlisted Securities Market experiment has been a failure.
Although there have been some successes, there have been a lot of duds. With
hindsight, small companies should not go to the stock market until one has
built up an enduring record.
'Small may be beautiful but big is strong, and the smaller companies can end
up pretty vulnerable without a broad market base and strong in-depth
management'.
He also criticised the lack of a clear industrial strategy by the
government.
'I am in favour of a government interventionist approach to industry. Not in
ownership, but to research, to guide and to prod along. There needs to be
more policy research. Even the big corporations tend to stick to what they
know best.
'An industrial policy is paramount and the ad hoc, scattergun approach,
creating a factory at every crossroads, is not a formula for a sound
industrial development strategy,' he said.
DCC has set up its own research unit to plan an acquisition programme 'which
will take us into Europe' he said. 'As a venture capital company we have had
experience with a wide range of sectors and we are now focused on the ones
we find the most interesting'.
In defying the trend of the move away from broad-based holding companies, Mr
Flavin believed DCC's strategy would work because 'we were always a hands-on
venture capital company, so we felt comfortable with becoming an industrial
holding company'.
He added: 'Divisional managers have a lot of autonomy and plenty of
incentives to achieve competitive results. In 16 years we have developed
good financial and strategic planning skills, and we have good operating
management skills. We are now in the process of fusing the two.'

FT  16 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Chinese gamble pays off for investors -
But foreign fund managers are troubled by currency problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who gambled on the shaky foundations of China's latest experiment
in capitalism have seen a drastic improvement in their fortunes in 1993.
Promises of positive intervention by the authorities have left the Standard
Chartered B share indices for Shenzhen and Shanghai up 51 per cent and 47
per cent respectively since the start of the year.
Local investors had always shown a hearty disrespect for the fundamentals of
equity investment, as was shown most clearly in August's Shenzhen riots over
a government lottery for new issue shares. But the B shares, available to
foreigners, have only recently begun to reflect the performance of their
local counterparts.
Main impetus for the latest rally has been external issues: these include
the decision temporarily to ignore a ban on local buying of Shanghai B
shares, and suggestions that Shenzhen shares will change from local currency
settlement to US or Hong Kong dollars, thereby saving foreign institutions
from the vagaries of China's currency swap centres.
As far as fundamentals are concerned, fund managers will soon get a genuine
sense of what they have bought in China, when last year's flotations reveal
the first sets of results as listed entities. Assuming no major shocks, the
markets will still appear expensive.
Standard Chartered Securities estimates that the Shanghai B share market is
trading on a 1993 price-earnings ratio of 17 times, while Shenzhen is on a
p/e of 26. By comparison, Hong Kong is trading on an estimated 1993 p/e of
11.
Among the Chinese companies there are some attractively priced businesses
profiting from booming consumer demand in Shanghai, or southern China; but
most analysts believe the majority of stocks are overvalued.
The picture has not been improved by the rapid weakening of the Renminbi,
the official currency. The RMB/US dollar swap rate has declined by 11.5 per
cent so far in 1993, and a substantial devaluation in the official exchange
rate is anticipated this year. This reduces foreign investors' profits, and
makes Chinese stocks appear more expensive.
Given these circumstances, fund managers are increasingly tempted to look at
cheaper opportunities for buying Chinese stocks in the more liquid and
regulated markets of the US and Hong Kong.
The number of Chinese stocks in Hong Kong is set to increase drastically, as
Beijing launches its first run of nine state industries on the Hong Kong
market during 1993. These will definitely absorb much of the cash held by
the growing numbers of China funds.
One positive factor this year will be the unleashing of the Hong Kong
speculator on the hitherto protected B share market. Previously, all
flotations have been issued through private placement to professional
investors, due to Hong Kong restrictions. Shares have ended up in a few
select hands, and secondary market turnover has tended to be limited.
However, Wardley Capital, the merchant banking arm of HSBC, has lodged the B
share prospectus of Shanghai Outer Gaoqiao Free Trade Development  - a
Shanghai property developer - with the Hong Kong Companies registrar.
Approval seems certain, and this would allow the shares to be sold to Hong
Kong investors as a public offer. This sets a trend for B share issuers to
tap a market which recently led to the oversubscription of the HKDollars
402m (USDollars 52m) offer for Chinese car manufacturer Denway by more than
HKDollars 240bn.
It is estimated that there will be 20 new issues in Shenzhen this year,
compared with nine in 1992, so the existence of a new investor base across
the border will be an important factor in the performance of the market.
In Shanghai, bankers expect up to 25 flotations this year; but of these only
five companies are expected to issue B shares, compared with 10 already in
existence.
The collapse of share prices in the second half of 1992 has limited the
prospect of flotations, suggesting that the new issues market should
continue to perform well.
However, the small size and light trading on the secondary markets means
that the only certainty for 1993 is that the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock
markets will remain extremely volatile.

WESFARMERS, the Australian agricultural and energy group, expects net
profits this year to improve on the ADollars 63.05m (USDollars 42.3m)
achieved for 1991-92, Reuter reports from Perth.
Wesfarmers, headed by managing director Mr Trevor Eastwood, reported a net
profit of ADollars 26.1m for the six months ended December 1992, up from
ADollars 19.33m a year earlier.
It said the profit rise in the six months reflected improved results from
its energy operations and a strong contribution from Bunnings, the 44 per
cent-owned timber group.
Wesfarmers said lower earnings from its fertilisers and chemical operations
were partly due to reduced margins, but mainly due to the late 1992 harvest.
Most fertiliser sales occur in the second half of the fiscal year.
It said its rural trading operations achieved a strong earnings improvement,
but the insurance operation was adversely affected by significant losses
from hail damage to crops throughout Australia.
Wesfarmers said dairy, transport and retail activities all achieved improved
results over the six months.
*****
Placer Pacific, the Australian gold mining group 76 per cent owned by Placer
Dome of Canada, increased after-tax profits by 11 per cent to ADollars 74.9m
(USDollars 50.2m) in 1992 on turnover 5 per cent higher at ADollars 607m.
The company is paying a dividend of 3.5 cents a share, having omitted the
payment a year ago.
Placer Pacific said the higher profits stemmed from increased sales volumes
from higher gold production and lower costs, partly offset by lower metal
prices.
*****
Westfield Holdings, the Australian shopping-centre developer and manager,
staged an 11 per cent rise to ADollars 15.6m (USDollars 10.4m) in after-tax
profits for the six months ended December 1992.
The dividend is going up from 5.25 cents a share to 5.75 cents. Westfield
said it expected the increase in dividend will be 'at least maintained' for
the final payment.
Westfield noted that three new shopping centres under its management opened
in the period, while it was also appointed developer/manager of another. The
total number of centres now under the company's management is 22, with more
than 1.1m sq metres of space to let and 3,750 tenants.
*****
UDL Holdings of Hong Kong has completed a HKDollars 142.6m (USDollars 18.4m)
share placement, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong.
The private placement with institutional and private investors in New York,
London and Hong Kong, involved 92m shares at a price of HKDollars 1.55 per
share. It represents 19.1 per cent of the capital of UDL, a marine and civil
engineering works group.
Amoy Properties is launching a three-year multi-currency loan facility worth
HKDollars 1bn through its unit, Amoy Treasury Ltd, bankers said. The issue,
which has been mandated to Barclays Bank and Deutsche Bank Hongkong.
*****
SKF, the Swedish bearings maker, plans to invest some MDollars 100m (Dollars
38m) to expand its manufacturing plant in Nilai, 60km south of Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, AP-DJ reports from Kuala Lumpur
SKF's marketing manager, Mr Gordon Goh, said the company has already
invested about MDollars 250m at the plant, which he claimed was the most
modern of the 80 SKF factories worldwide.
Mr Goh said the factory in Nilai produced deep groove and spherical roller
bearings of which 90 per cent were exported to the Asia-Pacific region. He
claimed that SKF had 20 per cent of the global market.
*****
The Saudi Monetary Agency (SAMA) has intervened to control stock market
share offerings and halt what it describes as illegal action by some Saudi
investors, Reuter reports from Manama.
According to locals bankers, SAMA has moved to dampen stock market
speculation by asking banks to reduce credits that investors use to purchase
shares.
'SAMA's action was aimed at discouraging investors from borrowing money to
speculate in the Saudi stock market,' a banker said.
He added that SAMA's move also aimed at halting illegal action by some Saudi
investors who buy names to improve their chances in the allocation process.

<TEXT>
CITIBANK'S wholly-owned Polish subsidiary has reported a 131.5bn zloty
(Dollars 8.3m) profit for 1992, its first full year of operation, writes
Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
The bank has concentrated on providing wholesale services to multinational
clients in Poland as well as locally-owned companies. The balance sheet at
the end of last year runs to 2,015bn zlotys with term deposits of 898.9bn
zlotys and current accounts valued at 774.7bn zlotys.
The bank, which is capitalised at 157.7bn zlotys has pursued a conservative
policy, preferring to deposit 1,105.4bn zlotys worth of its assets with
local state-owned banks and investing another 412.2bn zlotys in Treasury
bills. Loans accounted at the end of the year for a mere 461bn zlotys worth
of the bank's funds.
Bank officials explain that lending limits have restrained its ability to
provide loans and that it has been active in helping develop Poland's
capital market.
However, Mr Allan Hirst, Citibank Poland general manager, cautions that
interest rates are falling and profits are likely to be squeezed this year
as spreads narrow.

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Siemens energy unit sees 5% rise
in profits
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUISBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ADOLF Huttl, chairman of KWU energy division of Germany's Siemens
industrial group, expects profits to grow by 5 per cent for the current
fiscal year, in spite of a drop in orders for the first quarter.
The group, which builds nuclear and traditional power plants, recorded sales
of DM6.6bn (Dollars 3.97bn) for the year to September 30, 1992, up 32 per
cent from DM5bn the previous year. Orders reached DM8.6bn against DM8.8bn
the year before.
Exports rose significantly over the previous year to DM3.8bn against DM2.7bn
in 1991. Foreign orders accounted for 43 per cent of total orders compared
with 34 per cent the year before.
The US share of orders increased to 22 per cent, from 9 per cent of the
total figure.
In October, 1992, KWU operations in the US were regrouped under the Siemens
Power Corporation.
Orders from Asia increased to 36 per cent of the total from 34 per cent.
This was largely due to KWU's biggest contract which is a 817MW unfired
combined cycles power plant in Nan Pu in Taiwan.
KWU is also building large power plants in India and Indonesia.
A third of KWU's sales come from its nuclear-related business and two-thirds
from its production of conventional power plants. This nuclear share of the
group has been steadily declining over the years.
Mr Huttl also launched a bitter attack against the recent creation of a
Dollars 700m fund by the G-7 group to study ways to make nuclear power
stations in the former communist bloc safer. He called the amount
'negligible' and said billions of dollars were needed.
In Bonn, the environment ministry defended the plan, saying the money was
only a first step which would allow studies to be conducted and high-risk
nuclear power stations to be identified.

would raise hourly wage costs by about 1 per cent in the current year and
1.5 per cent in 1994. The main innovation is the right to full pay for the

The minimum wage rate for the lowest paid will go up in three tranches over

FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec is near to 1m b/d output
cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last night
reached the basis of an agreement to cut second quarter output by just under
1m barrels a day from the present quarter figures to 23.6m b/d.
The deal, which ministers hope to finalise this morning, looked to have been
agreed after Mr Ali al-Baghli, the Kuwait oil minister, said the Gulf state
would accept a cut in its production to 1.6m b/d for the second quarter.
Mr al-Baghli said Kuwait had reluctantly accepted the cut on condition that
its production would be subject to 'review' as the its reconstruction
programme increased capacity. Kuwait claims to be lifting 1.98m b/d and says
capacity will top 2.1m b/d in the second quarter. Industry and other Opec
estimates put Kuwait's output nearer 1.75m b/d.
The agreement, if sealed and if embraced with more than customary Opec
discipline, would strip just under 1m b/d from the first quarter ceiling of
24.58m b/d, but take closer to 1.5m b/d from the oil market overall, given
that most non-Opec estimates put the cartel's production above 25m b/d.
Most members are understood to have agreed to make pro-rata cuts towards a
ceiling which, according to Mr Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's energy
minister, might even dip below 23.6m b/d when final figures are tallied
today.
Ministers are eager to wrap up the agreement today, when the New York market
opens after a day's holiday. Gulf delegates said they may also seek to
reinforce the agreement's credibility by imposing the cuts in full by March
1.
Analysts said the figures for the overall ceiling and for Kuwait's output,
which had been the central point of contention over three days of talks in
Vienna, were likely to be met positively in the market and at least sustain
prices at pre-meeting levels. Crude prices had taken a Dollars 1.5-Dollars 2
fillip from the apparent consensus before this weekend's meeting that Opec
needed to cut its ceiling by at least 1m b/d.
Kuwait's agreement to accept 1.6m b/d was hard won. Its determination to
resist cuts caused no little resentment among other delegations, many of
which felt that Kuwait's pleading for special treatment after the Gulf war
had been overplayed and was jeopardising Opec's ability to deliver any
credibility to the market.
This resentment matched by Kuwait's indignance that countries which had
covered for its lost production during the Gulf war should be resisting what
it considered its rightful share of output.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EDPER Enterprises and Pagurian, two leading holding companies in the
business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, yesterday cut their
quarterly common share dividends in half.
The cuts reflect a thinning stream of dividend income and shrinking cash
resources in the upper layers of the Bronfman group.
Several operating companies, most notably in the real estate and financial
services sectors, have reduced their common dividends in the past year.
Bramalea, a property developer, has halted preferred dividends.
Edper, which is Mr Peter Bronfman's top public company, is reducing its
dividend to 20 cents a share from 40 cents. Pagurian, the main vehicle for
the Bronfmans' senior managers to participate as shareholders in the group,
has cut its dividend to 7.5 cents from 15 cents.
Mr Edward Bronfman, brother of Mr Peter Bronfman, has a minority interest of
19 per cent in Edper.
The top Bronfman companies have also lost an important source of dividend
income with last week's sale of the group's 38 per cent stake in John
Labatt, the brewer. Labatt has recently contributed about CDollars 32m
(Dollars 25.3m) a year to Brascan, its immediate holding company.
The Bronfman empire last week raised almost CDollars 2bn from the disposal
of the controlling block in Labatt and in MacMillan Bloedel, the
Vancouver-based forest products company.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEHNDORFF Group, the Canadian property finance and management group backed
mostly by German investors, has gained the approval of creditors for a debt
and business restructuring plan.
The Toronto-based group, which owns or administers about 230 properties,
said that it aimed to implement the plan towards the end of April following
what is expected to be a successful placing in Europe of CDollars 40m
(USDollars 31.7m) worth of investment units.
The new securities, which will have both an equity and a bond component with
a minimum return, are being sold to existing investors through JP Morgan of
New York. An offer to outsiders is possible at a later stage.
Lehndorff functioned as a group of limited partnerships and a management
company until the slump in the North American property market forced it to
seek court protection last December. The group, which has debts of about
CDollars 540m, will emerge as a single partnership managing its own
properties.
As part of the plan, it has shed peripheral activities, such as property
syndication and mutual funds, as well as some of its least profitable
limited partnerships. A new management team has also been installed.

YVES SAINT-LAURENT, the French fashion house embroiled in a political row
over its recent FFr3.6bn (Dollars 640m) takeover by Elf-Sanofi, the
pharmaceuticals group, yesterday warned of a sharp fall in net profits for
1992.
The group, which is run by Mr Pierre Berge, estimated that its operating
profits fell by about 25 per cent in 1992 - to around FFr384m from FFr512m
in 1991 - with net profits falling 'at a faster rate'.
YSL saw sales fall by 2 per cent to FFr3bn during the year from FFr3.06bn in
1991. The couture division was worst affected with sales falling by 5.5 per

Under the terms of the Elf deal, a complex share swap arrangement, the

Bull, the French computer group, saw sales fall 9.7 per cent from FFr33.45bn

FT  16 FEB 93 / BA and Virgin talks in trouble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic ran into further problems
yesterday when Virgin renewed its threat to take further legal action
against BA, Paul Betts writes.
Virgin said that after two weeks of negotiations the two sides were 'back to
the drawing board' in their efforts to settle their dispute over BA's 'dirty
tricks' campaign against Virgin.
Virgin is seeking a cash offer from BA for the 'serious commercial damage'
it claims to have suffered.
Relations between the two sides deteriorated following the disclosure at the
weekend of a letter from Mr Robert Ayling, BA's new managing director, to
Virgin, setting out proposals to settle the dispute. 'We do not expect to
see every piece of correspondence between the two companies in the
newspapers,' Virgin said, adding that the terms in the letter were
unacceptable.
The proposals included Pounds 3m in compensation for an earlier maintenance
dispute between the two airlines and an independent arbitration procedure on
Virgin's claims against BA. Virgin said the maintenance dispute was a
separate issue which had already been the subject of arbitration for the
past 18 months.
BA, which is expected to announce sharply lower third quarter earnings
today, yesterday described the talks between the two airlines last week as
'friendly', adding that both sides had agreed to continue discussions this
week.

FT  16 FEB 93 / City dealers profit from currency turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S withdrawal from its rigid tie with other European currencies and
the UK's deteriorating fiscal position turned 1992 into the best year since
1986 for gilt-edged marketmakers and turned stockbrokers and share dealers
from losses to profit.
Brokers and dealers in the equity market bounced back into profit by the end
of the year, after earlier recording their worst losses for nearly three
years, according to the Stock Exchange Quarterly review.
Gilts marketmakers made post-tax profits of Pounds 65m between them last
year, their best results since the reforms which reshaped the market in
1986, according to an article in the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin,
published today.
Heavy government borrowing helped breathe life back into the market, which
seemed doomed to become a backwater as the UK began to pay off public debt
in the 1980s. Trading in gilts jumped last year to Pounds 4.9bn a day, from
Pounds 4.4bn a day in 1991.
Some gilts houses are thought to have made good trading profits from gilt
market rallies prompted by the Conservatives' election victory in April, and
by sterling's departure from the ERM in September. These were balanced by a
reversal in early summer, when Danish voters voted against ratifying the
Maastricht treaty.
But 1993 has got off to a bad start for gilts marketmakers. Interest rates
were cut the day before a gilt auction in January, driving up gilt prices
and hitting marketmakers who had left themselves short of bonds in
anticipation of buying stock in the auction. Losses are estimated at Pounds
20m to Pounds 25m.
Meanwhile, the Stock Exchange review estimates that Stock Exchange members
made Pounds 24m in the final quarter of last year - a poor return on their
Pounds 4.5bn of capital, but a sharp improvement after pre-tax losses of
Pounds 126m in the third quarter.
The flow of rights issues so far this year and continuing buoyancy in the
equity market means that profits are likely to rise further.
The figures disclose that a sharp decline in brokers' income in the third
quarter accounted for the losses at that stage. Total income fell from over
Pounds 1bn in the previous quarter to just Pounds 739m as trading volumes
slipped. The boost to the stock market as sterling fell out of the ERM
reversed this, as trading volumes jumped after a summer lull.
'Things have got dramatically better,' said the head of equities at one
large bank in London. 'The question now is whether they continue to get
better, or whether people start bidding up salaries again.'
While the securities market continued to represent a poor return on capital,
gilts houses made a return of 15 per cent on the Pounds 432m capital they
had at the start of the year.

RUSSIA'S programme to convert state-owned industries and produce more
consumer goods has moved forward with an agreement between De Longhi, the
Italian white goods group, and SPA Impuls of St Petersburg to make microwave
and electric ovens, Haig Simonian writes from Milan.
The deal, worth Dollars 43m (Pounds 30m) a year for the next seven years,
involves a licensing agreement to use the De Longhi name on 500,000
conventional electric and microwave ovens a year to be sold in Russia and
other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
The agreement follows a decision by the Russian authorities to diversify the
activities of SPA Impuls, which makes computer hardware and software, into
consumer goods. De Longhi is to provide know-how for designing, planning and
building production lines.
The latest deal marks the third co-operation contract in Russia by De
Longhi, which had sales of L650bn (Pounds 295m) last year. Ansaldo, the
Italian public-sector engineering company which is part of the IRI state
holding group, has won a L193bn contract to supply equipment for a new
hydro-electric power station in Ecuador.
The group's Ansaldo-Gie subsidiary will supply turbines, generators and
transformers for a generating plant at Daule Peripa.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin, warned last night that
there was 'a real threat' of debt negotiations with foreign creditors being
broken off. He was speaking after Russia and Ukraine failed again to agree
how to divide the debt between them.
The former Soviet debt over which the two are haggling is around Dollars
80bn (Pounds 56.3m).
The two republics appeared close to an accord only last month, when Ukraine
said it had secured a deal under which it would pay independently for a
share of the debt in exchange for a share of former Soviet assets.
However, western creditors strongly oppose such a solution because of
concern that Ukraine might be unable to meet its obligations.
Mr Shokhin said at the time that any agreement would have to be acceptable
to the ex-Soviet Union's creditors.
Russia's biggest savings bank, Sberbank, said yesterday it was astonished by
a central bank attempt to take it over, and that such a move, if approved by
parliament, would provoke a return to a centralised Communist-era banking
system, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
Mr Pavel Zhikharev, Sberbank's chairman, speaking in Izvestia newspaper,
rejected the central bank's accusations that it had used its independence to
seek 'super-profits' and take excessive risks.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Confusion over Emu timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY finance ministers yesterday agreed to prolong member
states' economic 'convergence' programmes beyond the end of 1995, a move
which leaves open the possibility of a delay in economic and monetary union.
The European Commission portrayed the decision as a 'technical' matter which
would set a common framework for measuring EC members' performance on
inflation, budget deficits and government debt - the convergence criteria
set down as conditions for Emu in the Maastricht treaty.
But senior Commission officials were last night on the defensive after
several EC delegations suggested that the extension of convergence
programmes into 1996 could signal a delay in the Emu timetable, beyond the
earliest possible date of 1997.
Doubts about the convergence programmes have grown because of their
deflationary impact at a time of rising unemployment, and because Germany -
cornerstone of a future monetary union - does not meet the convergence
criteria for Emu because of the soaring costs of unification.
The Maastricht treaty leaves open the possibility of a delay until 1999.
But, until recently, the Commission and Emu advocates have stressed strict
convergence, with a view to early Emu - despite widespread scepticism in the
financial markets and ill-disguised reservations in Germany.
EC officials said the main reason for prolonging the convergence programmes
lay in significant differences in national programmes. There is a need for
common standards and methods for measuring readiness for Emu, they added.
Confusion about a Commission retreat on Emu began to circulate at the end of
a meeting of EC finance ministers in Brussels. The confusion grew after
Italian, German and Luxembourg diplomats reported that several delegations
had voiced disquiet about rising unemployment and poor growth prospects in
the EC.
A senior EC diplomat said several member states had complained that 17m
people were out of work in Europe, driving up budget deficits through lost
tax revenues and increasing the danger of social disorder.
A senior Luxembourg diplomat suggested that the Commission had laid the
groundwork for 'stretching out' the timetable for monetary union to take
account of lower-than-expected growth. But Mr Henning Christophersen, EC
economics commissioner, categorically denied it. He stressed that
co-operation on a Community-wide growth initiative would increase the
prospects for Emu, if possible by 1997.
Mr Christophersen said that convergence programmes would continue if
necessary, 'into eternity' so that all EC members would have the chance to
meet the strict Emu criteria. 'We are not talking about a delay in the
general process. We are talking about a common time frame.'

FT  16 FEB 93 / Clerides victory may harden stance on Cyprus talks at UN
</HEADLINE>

   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE surprise victory of Mr Glafcos Clerides in Sunday's presidential
election in Cyprus could lead to a harder Greek Cypriot stance in United
Nations-sponsored talks on reuniting the island.
Mr Clerides, the veteran leader of the right-wing Democratic Rally party,
edged out Mr George Vassiliou, the incumbent, by a margin of less than one
percentage point.
The result, determined by fewer than 2,000 votes, upset opinion poll
forecasts that Mr Vassiliou would win by a comfortable margin. Mr Vassiliou,
backed by the Cyprus communist party and many Socialist voters, held a seven
percentage point lead after the first-round ballot.
The change of leadership may mean that the next round of UN-sponsored talks
on reuniting Cyprus, set for March, is delayed while Mr Clerides works out a
new negotiating policy.
Mr Clerides, a 73-year-old lawyer making his third bid for the presidency,
served as chief Greek Cypriot negotiator in talks with the Turkish Cypriots
in the 1960s and early 1970s.
He is considered to have a realistic approach to solving the division of the
island.
However, he may be constrained by his party's alliance with the centre-right
Diko, which is unwilling to make concessions to the Turkish Cypriot minority
in northern Cyprus. Prominent members of Diko are expected to be offered
senior jobs in the administration.
Mr Clerides has said he wants to change the 'set of ideas' developed by Mr
Vassiliou and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, as a basis
for making Cyprus a federated state with Greek and Turkish Cypriots living
in separate zones.
Mr Clerides wants to improve the terms on which Greek-owned property
occupied by Turkish Cypriots in northern Cyprus would be returned or
compensated for.
Mr Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, responded to the news of Mr
Clerides' election by asking to meet him ahead of talks in New York.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Clinton 'call to arms' over tax rises and job plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night issued a 'call to arms' to Americans to
back the economic programme that he will unveil in his State of the Union
address to Congress tomorrow.
In a televised address from the White House, he acknowledged openly for the
first time that he would have to raise taxes on the middle class, as well as
on wealthier taxpayers. This, he said, was because forecasts of the federal
budget deficit were now much worse than his own estimates or the worst
government projections.
But the president promised that 70 per cent of the extra taxes he will
demand would be paid by those earning more than Dollars 100,000 (Pounds
71,000) a year.
He also promised a 'pay off' in the form of 500,000 jobs created this year
and next year by a federal infrastructure spending programme and 'millions
of jobs' over the longer term. He appealed for backing with a 'call to arms
to restore the vitality of the American dream'.
Mr Clinton's TV address was intended to prepare the way for his economic
plan, much of which is expected to provoke opposition from a variety of
interest groups. White House officials insisted earlier that no final
decision had been on the package but it is expected to combine short-term
tax incentives and government spending increases with higher taxes designed
to help reduce the budget deficit.
A new USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll published yesterday showed half of those
questioned were willing to pay higher taxes in order to reduce the deficit.
The main components of the package are expected to be:
Investment tax credits for business worth around Dollars 15bn this year.
Dollars 16bn of additional government spending this year, mostly on
infrastructure.
An energy tax levied on the thermal content of fuels.
A rise in the corporate income tax rate from 34 per cent to 36 per cent.
Taxation of a greater proportion of retirement benefits.
Spending cuts totalling an estimated Dollars 34bn over four years.
Mr Leon Panetta, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said this
would come close to achieving the Dollars 145bn reduction in the federal
budget deficit that Mr Clinton promised by 1997.

FT  16 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE single trade in conglomerate Hanson's stock options ahead of today's
figures was the main feature in the derivates market, writes Joel Kibazo.
The Hanson trade contributed significantly to total turnover of 30,161 lots
in traded options, just ahead of Friday's figure. However, business in the
FT-SE 100 option was modest, volume reaching only 9,334 contracts.
In Hanson, a leading securities house was reported to have bought a large
quantity of the February 240 puts, and by the close of business Hanson
options had traded a total of 6,232 contracts. It was followed by Glaxo at
1,849 lots, Asda at 1,833 and then by Lonrho, which was also busy in the
equities, at 1,681 contracts.
In stock index futures, an initial sell-off after the March contract on the
Footsie opened at 2,842 was followed by a gentle squeeze which drove it
forward. March remained at the higher levels for most of the session and
touched the day's peak of 2,858 around lunchtime, although actual buying
remained thin.
With little in the way of economic features, and Wall Street closed, the
earlier interest in the contract waned and it drifted lower for the rest of
the day.
It finished at 2,853, a premium of one to the underlying cash market, with
volume coming to a meagre 4,488 trades, well below Friday's total of 12,521
lots.

FT  16 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cautious opening to the new account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK to be featured by a heavy list of economic and corporate news opened
with a UK stock market firm but drifting uneasily amid continuing
uncertainty over sterling and domestic interest rates. Coolness in the
London market was not helped by Wall Street's closure for President's Day
and by caution ahead of important presentations to Congress this week by
President Clinton and by Mr Alan Greenspan, head of the US Federal Reserve.
UK market indices were also restrained by weakness in the oil issues, where
lack of US interest was compounded by lower crude prices and uncertain
progress at the Opec talks. One of the few bright spots was the firmness of
some Far Eastern stocks in response to a turn for the better in the Hong
Kong market.
It was also the first day of the new two-week trading account in the equity
market and share prices opened easier in thin trading. With sterling still
weak in early deals and investors heeding Friday's rejection of interest
rate optimism by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, there
appeared little to go for in equities.
Also unsettling were the latest reports from Westminster, although worries
over the government's handling of the Maastricht debate lessened after
denials that it had considered ignoring the outcome of the parliamentary
vote on an amendment to the Treaty.
However, the stock market picked up, largely on the back of renewed interest
in the second line issues. By late morning, the FT-SE 100 Index was 11.7
ahead but, although support for the second rankers was maintained, the
absence of a lead from Wall Street took the heart out of the blue chips.
Lloyds Bank was a dull spot as profits were taken in the wake of Friday's
sparkling results and dividend announcement.
At the final reading, the gain on the FT-SE 100 had been trimmed to 2.9 for
a close of 2,845.9. However, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index remained 16.2 up at
3,022.5, and non-Footsie stocks increased to around 72 per cent their
percentage of the day's Seaq total of 516.2m shares. On Friday, Seaq trading
of 830.2m shares was worth a healthy Pounds 1.49bn in terms of retail
business, fully sustaining the substantially improved volume trend in London
equities.
Strategists took the view that the stock market had stood up well, in view
of the weakness in oils and ex-dividend markdowns in prices for some leading
blue chips. The activity in the smaller stocks made up for poor turnover in
the blue chips, many of which struggled to return sub-average daily volume
figures.
In addition to the developments this week in the US, the London market faces
important data on the progress of the domestic economy, ranging from the
latest survey of distributive trades by members of the Confederation of
British Industry, due today, to the January statistics on UK unemployment
and money supply, expected on Thursday.
At Nikko, Mr Peter Thorne believes that the unemployment figures could show
a further rise, 'sufficiently large' to renew speculation of another base
rate cut, in spite of last week's firm rejection of such plans by the UK
chancellor. But the stock market was also keeping a close eye on the foreign
exchange markets, mindful of the pressures that a run on the pound could
impose on any decision on interest rates.

brewery sector weakened by comments from Foster's, the Australian group,
which owns Courage in Britain. GrandMet moved into the NatWest 'Top Ten Buy'
list as the broker decided recent underperformance had been overdone and
that next week's agm statement would be cautiously optimistic on current
trading, particularly in the weak North American food business.
Analyst Mr Geoff Collyer said the chances of the group making a rights
issue, a factor behind the stock's recent poor performance, had diminished
as the currency market had moved against sterling.
GrandMet rose in early trading, but weakened as the Foster's news hit the
market. Foster's reported that its UK margins were under pressure, beer
volume was down and the government's drinks legislation was creating
difficult market conditions. The shares closed 2 down at 438p in turnover of
4.1m. Bass lost 5 to 573p, Allied-Lyons 3 to 580p, Scottish &amp; Newcastle 7 to
423p and Whitbread 'A' 8 to 474p.
Unigate buoyant
Food conglomerate Unigate enjoyed a further buoyant session as it announced
another acquisition and sought to assure the market that it did not intend
to raise cash through a rights issue. The company clinched its second deal
in four days with the purchase of Glass Glover Group for Pounds 54m, after
picking up Clifford Foods on Friday for Pounds 50.4m. Unigate won more
plaudits as it held out the prospect of recovering most of its outlay by
floating its US restaurant operations. Analysts said this would realise more
than Pounds 100m.
Yesterday's moves were also welcomed as another component in Unigate's
strategy of concentrating its business on the UK in general and the food
manufacturing sector in particular. Analysts said that, because of cheap
borrowings, the Glass Glover acquisition should boost earnings. As with
Friday's deal, most analysts raised profits forecasts by between Pounds 1m
to Pounds 3m. The shares jumped 15 to 357p.
Lloyds sold
Further consideration of the results from Lloyds Bank imposed a drag on the
share price, which fell 8 1/2 to 513p xd.
The negative view was emphasised by Mr Mark Eady of NatWest Securities, who
published a sell recommendation yesterday, arguing that the figures had been
flattered by foreign exchange trading profits, currency translation gains
and write-downs for third world debts. The shares were further affected by
recurrent speculation that the bank might bid for TSB.
US house Lehman Brothers also voiced caution, arguing that: 'The shares
looked stretched without a new source of operating gains.' Lehman suggests
switching into Abbey National, up 3 at 359p, or Barclays, 12 higher at 447p.
TI lower
Shares in aerospace and engineering company TI Group were hit by reports
that American Airlines was considering returning some of its 34 Airbus
aircraft as a cost-cutting measure. The shares lost 11 to 294p. The company
is exposed to Airbus through the Dowty subsidiary it acquired last year.
Hoare Govett yesterday reiterated its caution on several of the aerospace
and engineering stocks, including TI, which weakened sentiment in the stock
further. However, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was said to be positive on TI.
Oil shares were marked lower as the market awaited agreement on oil
production cuts at the Opec meeting in Vienna. BP, trading ex a 2.1p
dividend, was down 4 1/2 at 267p, while Shell Transport was a penny lower at
590p.
Volumes were low principally because of the closure of the US market for
President's Day. Mr Fergus Mcleod of NatWest Securities added: 'I think the
poor turnover shows that people are sitting on their hands waiting to see
how Opec turns out.' There was particular concern that Kuwait appeared to be
standing firm against an output reduction and crude oil prices were also
depressed.
Building products group MB-Caradon attracted attention after the company
said it was to seek shareholder's permission to sell its 25.3 per cent stake
in packaging manufacturer CarnaudMetalbox.
At the day's best, MB shares were up 11 at 321p, as dealers speculated that
the sale signalled a more lucrative purchase for MB-Caradon. But
profit-taking later in the day saw the stock surrender the early gain and
close unchanged at 310p after trade of 1.3m shares. CarnaudMetalbox rose 62
to 2675p. Old bid favourites Hepworth, up 11 at 347p, and Marley, 4 ahead at
113p, were put in the frame as a result of the MB-Caradon deal.
Blue Circle put on 4 at 213p as NatWest Securities declared itself more
positive, describing the stock as a 'highly marketable long term recovery
play'. BPB firmed 3 to 222p following a series of recent presentations.
The speculation that someone will bid for Fisons, the pharmaceuticals and
scientific equipment group, refused to die and the shares added a further 4
at 245p. Hanson was yesterday's predicted suitor and shares in the
conglomerate eased a penny to 254p ahead of first-quarter figures due today.
Hanson was also very actively traded in the options market.
Reuters Holdings recovered more ground following last week's figures and
closed 12 higher at 1348p.
Rothmans International improved 13 to 622p in reaction to last week's news
that the company plans to restructure its Singapore and Malaysian tobacco
companies. The pound's general weakness also helped the shares as 90 per
cent of the tobacco group's earnings come from outside the UK.
Inchcape, the motor and consumer goods distributor, rose 14 to 578p after
Nikko Europe raised its 1993 profits forecast to Pounds 300m from Pounds
270m.
Political speculation in Hong Kong, fuelling rises in the Hang Seng index,
helped HSBC and Cable and Wireless. The latter was also given a push by
Hoare Govett, which said the stock had extra value from currency movements,
benefiting Pounds 4m for every one cent movement in the US dollar against
sterling. The shares advanced 14 to 733p. HSBC ordinary rose 8 to 598p and
the Hong Kong registered 9 to 580p.
The insurance sector gave a strong performance, with buyers encouraged by a
positive note from securities house Smith New Court. Mr Steven Bird, Smith's
insurance analyst, said: 'All the composites should see a significant
improvement in their earnings over the next few years.' The team's 'nap
selection' is Commercial Union, but an early gain of 5 was whittled away by
the afternoon and the shares closed a penny easier at 605p. The house also
likes General Accident, 9 higher at 575p.
Ratification of the EC agreement on bananas boosted Geest, which surged 26
to 419p. Further press speculation on the prospects of VAT being imposed on
food failed to have any more impact on retailers, whose shares have been
consistently weak in recent sessions. But, similar worries taxed WH Smith,
the 'A' shares shedding 7 to 415p xd.
Interim results and an increased dividend from Dalgety pleased the market
and the shares added 3 at 470p. While its areas such as pet foods and crisps
were stronger, prospects of margins squeezing elsewhere led many analysts to
reduce profits slightly for the full year.
Dividend hunters sought out Rank Organisation and the shares added 8 at
696p.
Comment in the Sunday press attracted early support for Castle Mill
International, the handbag maker. A subsequent shortage of stock left the
shares up 2 3/4 at 8 1/2 p.
International trader Lonrho was in demand as investors reflected on the
changes in the company's management. The stock gained 5 1/2 at 87p xd in
heavy trade of 9.5m.

WALL STREET was closed for President's Day.
Toronto went into limbo for the US holiday, share prices tending to ease
slightly in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index slipped 3.4 points to finish
at 3,442.2. Declines outnumbered rises by 305 to 277 and volume fell to
30.1m shares from Friday's 49.1m.
The market's dull tone was not felt in the real estate group, which rose 2.4
per cent.

JOHANNESBURG eased as institutional interest remained muted after last
week's strong gains, particularly in the gold sector. The stock market
auth-orities said yesterday that turnover during the course of last week of
some R763m, against R619m in the previous week, was the highest since August
1990. The overall index lost 18 to 3,474 and industrials shed 22 to 4,550.
The golds index eased 3 to 961.

FT  16 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Australia rises after election date is
set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia and the Nordic region of Europe showed strong gains last week, but
currency volatility in Japan and a feeling that the rally in US equities
since the start of the year might have been overdone left the FT-Actuaries
World Index slightly depressed.
Senior European bourses also enjoyed a positive week, with Germany extending
its gains throughout the five days to finish at a seven-month high. Many
analysts now expect the DAX index to break through the 1,700 level this week
as overseas buying strength continues.
Australia took heart from the announcement that the federal election will be
held on March 13, thereby removing an element of uncertainty, and by
Thursday had reached a six-month peak. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister,
also promised a series of economic measures designed to stimulate business
investment, including a reduction in the company tax rate.
Other reasons for the market's fresh impetus included good results from News
International and Commonwealth Bank, and solid gains in the resources
sector, encouraged particularly by the strength of gold on the world
markets.
Sweden came to life after Ericsson issued better than expected 1992 results,
with the 'B' shares advancing 9 per cent on the day of their release. A
stronger dollar and expectations of lower interest rates also lifted
sentiment.
Norway, its eyes firmly fixed on last weekend's Opec meeting, anticipated a
cut in oil production and marked up the sector accordingly.
Among other soft currency markets, Italy was gripped by further political
intrigue as, first, the justice minister resigned as investigations were
begun on possible corruption charges, and then, a day later, Mr Bettino
Craxi, the former prime minister, quit as leader of the Socialist party
because of his alleged involvement in the same scandal.

FT  16 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent subdued in absence
of Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH US markets closed activity on the Continent was restrained yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT finished with the DAX index just 3.28 higher at 1,664.71, but from
pre-market to post-bourse it moved in a 2 per cent range, and progressively
higher.
Turnover fell from DM7bn to DM5.6bn as the DAX recovered from a fall to
1,650 in the pre-bourse, and as the German component of the FT-SE Eurotrack
100 index climbed higher in the afternoon.
The mood of the market was exemplified in the performance of Volkswagen, for
which Mr Klaus-Jurgen Melzner, of DB Research, downgraded his 1992 dividend
forecast to DM4 from last year's DM11, observing that he was looking to a
loss, and no dividend, in 1993.
VW bottomed at DM288.50, recovered to close DM6.70 lower on DM291, and
picked up another DM1.50 after hours. Among other blue chips, Allianz was
quoted DM10 higher at DM2,230 and Schering rose DM11 to DM719.
Preussag, the engineering and steel group, rose by DM5.10 to DM379.20. In
the same sector, Linde rose DM10.50 to DM788 and Deutsche Babcock by DM3 to
DM159 on a DM240m order to build four 250 megawatt power plants outside of
Beijing.
PARIS saw a strong rise in CGIP after trading in Carnaud Metalbox, in which
it has a 25.3 per cent stake, was suspended before the start of business
following an announcement by UK group, MB-Caradon, that it was to sell its
own stake. CGIP improved FFr73 to FFr1,085.
The CAC-40 index closed 12.40 lower at 1,899.49 in turnover of some FFr2bn.
Peugeot gained FFr8 to FFr623 following its announcement of 1992 sales after
Friday's close.
AMSTERDAM closed early because of technical problems, the CBS just 0.2
firmer at 99.1.
Before trading was halted Fokker stood 17 per cent higher on the day, up Fl
1.80 at Fl 12.30, on news after Friday's close that the Dutch government had
accepted revised terms for the purchase of a 51 per cent stake in the group
by Dasa.
KLM went against the trend with a Fl 1.40 loss to Fl 25.70 in low volume on
domestic newspaper reports of financial difficulties at Northwest Airlines,
even though the Dutch operator said earlier this month that it had written
down the remaining book value of its 20 per cent stake in Wings Holdings,
parent group of Northwest.
MILAN closed the February account with Fiat building on Friday's gains,
assisted by early rumours, later denied, that Deutsche Bank was considering
increasing its present 2.6 per cent stake in the car maker. Fiat fixed at
L5,140, up L444, before easing to L5,080 on the kerb after the German bank
said that it had no plans to lift its investment. The Comit index advanced
8.12 to 500.25.
STOCKHOLM remained firm with property stocks generally stronger after
weekend reports that the sector will be a beneficiary of lower interest
rates. Skanska improved SKr1 to SKr95 as the Affarsvarlden index put on 2.5
to 983.7 in turnover of some SKr1.1bn.
Astra was firm ahead of its 1992 results due next Monday while there was
also speculation that it may announce a scrip issue or share split. The B
shares rose SKr7 to SKr700.
OSLO fell back with some investors discouraged by the failure of the Opec
meeting at the weekend to agree new oil production levels. The all-share
index fell 3.70 to 403.68 in turnover of NKr425.8m. Norsk Hydro lost NKr1.50
to NKr165.
VIENNA cleared the 800 hurdle again, the ATX index rising 10.32 to 801.33 in
a market which seemed short of stock. The day's winners included the
cellulose fibre manufacturer, Lenzing, which rose Sch17 to Sch554, and
Creditanstalt preferred, Sch15 up at Sch510.
ISTANBUL's market index hit a second consecutive two-year-high, closing
96.62, or 1.8 per cent higher at 5,341.46.
TEL AVIV closed sharply higher after the treasury and the central bank said
that they will not intervene in the market. Private investors and provident
funds were dominant as the blue chip index recouped 4.35, or 2.2 per cent to
202.69 in good volume of Shk254m.

FT  16 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers as Hong
Kong gains 3.3%

<TEXT>
A FALL in the yen against the dollar following Japanese and US talks over
the weekend soothed market worries about last week's volatility in the
currency markets, and the Nikkei average regained the 17,000 level, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei rose 266.48 to end at the day's high of 17,117.99 on active
buying by public funds and index-linked purchases by investment trusts,
having fallen to a low of 16,920.04 in the morning on selling by
arbitrageurs.
Volume declined to 190m shares from Friday's 281m, which was supported by
trading linked to stock option settlements. Advances outscored declines by
595 to 334, with 173 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks put on 11.81 at 1,300.76, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
firmed 0.24 to 1,047.17.
Currency markets stabilised after Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the finance minister,
announced that Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, had not called
for higher yen rates to cut Japan's trade surplus, during their meeting over
the weekend. The dollar gained Y0.70 against the yen to finish at Y121.15.
Traders said buying by public fund managers convinced short sellers of firm
support around the 17,000 Nikkei line. 'Fears of a near-term market crash
have receded on active buying by public funds,' commented Mr Yasuo Ueki at
Nikko Securities.
High-technology exporters, sold off last week on concern about the higher
yen, rebounded. Fujitsu moved forward Y15 to Y540 and Sony rose Y50 to
Y4,110. Hitachi, however, remained unchanged at Y695, held back by foreign
investor selling. Overseas selling depressed Toyota Motor, Y20 down at
Y1,380.
Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, rose Y4 to Y297 on buying by
public funds. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y8 at Y509. Banks saw heavy
volume as investors sold and bought back holdings to realise profits:
Shizuoka Bank appreciated Y40 to Y1,340 but Asahi Bank was flat at Y900.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 36.87 ahead at 18,410.02 in volume of 95.3m
shares.
Roundup
THE REGION'S winners were more vigorous than its losers yesterday.
HONG KONG's Hang Seng index topped 6,000 for the first time since November,
adding 191.29, or 3.3 per cent, at 6,049.44. Turnover totalled HKDollars
3.52bn (HKDollars 2bn on Friday).
Overseas institutions snapped up shares on renewed hopes that Britain and
China would start talking about finding a solution to the impasse over Hong
Kong's political development. Reports in local newspapers said that China
would not insist on Mr Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, dropping his
democratic reform package before Sino-British talks on the stalemate are
held.
SINGAPORE rose on balance but some blue chips shed weight on continued
consolidation ahead of Friday's national budget. The Straits Times
Industrial index closed 5.05 higher at 1,618.57.
TAIWAN was bullish but volatile after the nomination of Lien Chan, governor
of Taiwan province, as premier last week. The weighted index ended 13.31
ahead at 3,876.76, a five-month high, after an advance of more than 40
points in the early stages. Turnover surged to TDollars 44.73bn, its
heaviest since last June.
AUSTRALIA staged a late rally after a sharp initial retreat to leave a
slightly weaker close following a string of higher company half-year
profits. The All Ordinaries index was finally 7.0 off at 1,596.5.
Foster's, Placer Pacific, Wesfarmers, Stanilite, Charles Davis and Rabbit
Photos all reported rises in half-year profits, which brokers saw as
favourable for the market.
BOMBAY declined on worries that the government might not secure enough
parliamentary support for its budget proposals later this month. The BSE
index finished 105.28 lower at 2,640.20.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Quiet day for the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NATIONAL holiday in the US and anticipation of President Clinton's evening
fireside address resulted in quiet European trading, writes Emma Tucker.
The pound drifted gently lower in the morning, 'treading water' as one
analyst put it, before today's figures for December manufacturing output,
and public sector borrowing in January.
Recent declarations from Mr Eddie George, governor designate of the Bank of
England, that the authorities are not considering an early rate cut appear
to have convinced the market, at least for the time being. Analysts,
however, said another bad set of economic data, and further falls in
inflation, could soon change sentiment.
'It is almost unprecedented to engineer economic recovery with real interest
rates at about 4 per cent,' said Mr Avinash Persaud, currency economist at
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'The comments over the weekend have dampened
expectations of an imminent rate cut, but were we to see unemployment rising
sharply this month or next month those comments would soon be forgotten.'
Sterling received a lift late in the afternoon after the UK government said
it intended to press on and ratify the Maastricht treaty even if an
opposition Labour party amendment aimed at restoring the Social Chapter wins
parliamentary approval. There had been fears in the market that the
government would drop the Treaty altogether if the amendment were passed.
The pound finished  1/2 pfennig down from Friday's close at DM2.3525.
The dollar traded in a very narrow range, with the market waiting for
President Clinton to flesh out his administration's policies in the State of
the Union address tomorrow.
In late European trading the US currency was quoted at DM1.6600, moving
within a  1/2 -pfennig range. It ended at DM1.6590, compared with Friday's
close of DM1.6625.
Currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism were also locked into a
narrow range, with the Spanish peseta, the strongest in the grid, only 2.7
per cent above the system's weakest currency, the French franc. The Spanish
currency continued the gentle weakening that started at the end of last
week, closing at Pta71.40 per D-Mark, against Pta71.16 on Friday.
The D-Mark rose against an increasingly beleaguered Swiss franc. The German
currency reached its highest level at the Frankfurt fixing against the Swiss
franc for 12 years, boosted by interest rate differentials favouring the
D-Mark and pessimism about Switzerland's isolated position.
The German unit was fixed at DM107.41 per 100 Swiss francs, its highest
point since June 30, 1980, according to Bundesbank data.
A trader said: 'The negative feeling about the Swiss franc has been growing.
There is a feeling that the isolationism is getting it into trouble.'

FT  16 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS little activity on the UK money markets as the high spirits of
Friday, when inflation fell to record lows, wore off.
Traders said the market had overreacted and was now absorbing Friday's
comments from both Mr Eddie George, governor designate of the Bank of
England, and Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, that the authorities do
not intend to cut rates in the near future.
Although the market has recently been sceptical about statements of intent
from the government, one trader said Mr Lamont's apparent desire to
safeguard the exchange rate did appear to be 'sinking in'.
Short sterling futures drifted lower in the morning with the realisation
that Friday's euphoria was 'premature'. The March contract dropped 11 basis
points from Friday's close to 94.09, with traders reporting that the market
was also concerned about sterling's weakness on the foreign exchange
markets.
Movement in interbank rates was less pronounced than in the futures market.
This was partly because the Bank of England's forecast shortage was much
smaller than had been expected.
A dealer commented: 'Cash rates would have gone up further if it had not
been for the small size of the shortage. In fact, there was no great
pressure upwards on rates and that is why futures have reacted worse than
cash rates.'
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 800m in the morning and
purchased bills totalling Pounds 300m for resale to the market on March 11
and 12 at a rate of 5 29/32 per cent in the early round. The forecast was
revised to a shortage of around Pounds 750m later, following which the Bank
bought a further Pounds 244m of bills.
The Bank all but cleared the shortfall in the afternoon by buying Pounds 72m
of bills and offering late assistance of Pounds 105m.
In Germany, a sharper than expected rise in the wholesale prices index
pushed Euromark futures down as prospects for early monetary easing receded.
Wholesale prices in the former West Germany rose 0.7 per cent in January
from the previous month, against market expectations of a 0.1 per cent
month-on-month increase.
Futures were also depressed by comments late last week from Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, suggesting that a rate cut in
Germany was unlikely this week. The March Euromark contract slipped about 6
basis points to 91.92.
Generally, however, the market was on hold before today's regular Bundesbank
repo pact.

<TEXT>
WORLD JUTE production in 1992-93 (July-June) is likely to fall by 15.2 per
cent to about 2.9m tonnes, according to the International Jute Organisation,
reports Reuter from Dacca.
It blamed the drop mainly on declining yields in Bangladesh and India, the
two biggest producers. Production is expected to fall by 22.2 per cent to
1.26m tonnes in India and by 12.7 per cent to 828,000 tonnes in Bangladesh.
The IJO gave no reasons for the output falls but Bangladeshi government
officials said many growers were discouraged by higher production costs and
low prices in domestic market.
The IJO said production of jute was expected to rise in China, Thailand and
Nepal.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Contestants expect close finish
to NY exchange leadership race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW York Mercantile Exchange, best known for its huge crude oil futures
ring, is engaged in a leadership struggle that could result in the
redefinition of the way exchanges return profits to their member-owners.
Mr Lou Guttman, the flamboyant Nymex chairman, is elaborating a plan to
redistribute exchange earnings directly to members in a bid to gain a third
term at the helm of the nation's third-largest futures exchange. While
similar proposals have been made before, tax and legal factors have
prevented their implementation. The Nymex, with its robust volume and
history of successful new products, may be more financially suited to the
scheme than any other US exchange.
The Nymex chairman is in a hotly-contested race to remain in the post after
being passed over by an exchange nominating committee. The committee
recommended Mr Daniel Rappaport, Nymex vice chairman and long-time director,
as the next chairman.
The election will be held on March 16. While it is usual for nominees to run
opposed, Mr Guttman will stand against Mr Rappaport as an independent
candidate. His candidacy, some exchange members say, will be coloured by his
continuing difficulties with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
US futures industry watchdog.
Mr Guttman took a leave of absence from his chairmanship in July, when the
CFTC told him that it was planning civil charges against him for violating
trading regulations. The agency has not filed the charges, and Mr Guttman
returned to the chairman's office December. During his five-month absence,
Mr Rappaport filled in as chairman.
Mr Rappaport vows to keep Mr. Guttman's legal problems out of the debate.
'It would be unfair even to raise (them),' he says. 'Many of our members
believe he has not been treated appropriately by the CFTC.'
Both Mr Guttman and Mr Rappaport are supporters of the Nymex's move to new
quarters in Manhattan in late 1994, and both say they would welcome a
marriage with the New York Commodity Exchange should a Chicago Board of
Trade take-over fail.
The contest, they agree, will be close, and is likely to be decided by
appeals to members' wallets. While the Nymex had a record volume of 47m
contracts in 1992, and record profits of Dollars 27m, floor traders and
member firms complain of declining profits, a malaise shared by their
counterparts at other US futures exchanges.
Mr Rappaport believes that better administration would remedy the situation.
'We have deficiencies in long-term planning, staff inefficiencies, and more
needs to be done in the way of member benefits,' he says.
Mr Guttman, despite his 5-year tenure as chairman, is also running on a
reform platform.
Saying his leadership has been hampered by a divided and politically
apathetic membership, he is designing a limited partnership that would
distribute operating profits to members annually.
'I see it as a way to re-involve members in exchange financial affairs. It
would provide a focus, make them demand more accountability,' he says.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US gold explorers head south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING US gold producers are cutting exploration spending at home while
increasing it substantially in Latin America, according to a survey by the
Gold Institute, a Washington-based, industry-financed organisation.
Worldwide exploration spending by the 18 companies surveyed - which together
accounted for 73 per cent of 1991 US gold output - fell by 16 per cent last
year from Dollars 280m to an estimated Dollars 235m.
Their gold exploration in the US fell by 18 per cent to a four-year low of
Dollars 149m. This represented 63 per cent of total exploration budgets,
down from 65 per cent in 1991 and 71 per cent as recently as 1989.
'This is the first time spending and share simultaneously declined - clear
evidence that the US market is growing unattractive for investment,' the
institute suggests.
Meanwhile, exploration spending in Latin America, which was only Dollars 14m
in 1989, increased by a further 16 per cent last year, from Dollars 30m to
and estimated Dollars 35m.
'Latin American nations are taking deliberate and aggressive steps to
recruit US investment. Mining is an internationally competitive business and
capital will flow to those nations which have mineral wealth and offer an
attractive business climate,' the institute says.
It admits its survey excludes exploration work by small companies,
prospectors and independent exploration companies - an important part of the
business - but points out that 'the presence of a senior (big) gold producer
in a given country is a sure sign that smaller companies have led the way'.
The survey shows spending by US gold producers in Canada remained steady at
an average of Dollars 27m a year or 10 to 11 per cent of exploration
budgets. However, 'US producers appear to be wrapping up their efforts in
Australia where spending (down from Dollars 14m in 1991 to an estimated
Dollars 10m last year) and share (down from 5 per cent to 4.25 per cent)
declined over the period of the survey'.
In 1992 US producers cut spending in the rest of the world by 42 per cent to
Dollars 15m.
The survey will provide the US mining industry with ammunition as it battles
against efforts being made in Congress to impose a national royalty on
mineral production and other measures that the industry suggests would
discourage investment in mining in the US. The institute points out that
during the 1980s the US became the world's second-biggest gold producer and
adds: 'As congressional and administration leaders consider measures to
reform laws regulating this industry, they must carefully consider how their
actions will affect the competitive position of the US'.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco may aid Russian nickel
clean-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S two biggest nickel producers, Norilsk of Russia and Inco of
Canada, have signed technical assistance protocols that may lead to Inco
helping to reduce pollution from Norilsk's smelters.
Inco said yesterday that Norilsk wanted to cut sulphur dioxide emissions,
the main cause of acid rain, and might use the oxygen flash smelting
technology Inco developed for its Sudbury, Ontario, smelter where the group
expects to reduce sulphur dioxide pollution by 60 per cent in three years.
The companies are also discussing a possible joint venture to build mining
equipment, using Inco's so-called Continuous Mining Systems technology.
However, Inco denied reports from Moscow that it was also discussing with
Norilsk methods of limiting nickel exports from Russia. The upsurge in
Russian exports is widely held to be responsible for present low London
Metal Exchange nickel prices.
Falconbridge, another Canadian nickel group, also denied reports that it was
involved in three-sided talks with the other two producers. Falconbridge
said there had been exchanges of technical people between itself and Norilsk
for the past two years, but no other contacts.

The US President's Day holiday tended to restrict interest on the LME, where
most prices moved lower. Three-month COPPER traded in a softer range,
encountering support near Dollars 2,220 a tonne, where Chinese buying is
expected, and running into overhead resistance around Dollars 2,231.
Three-month ALUMINIUM gradually lost ground in the afternoon, after heavy
midsession buying interest around Dollars 1,220 faded. Prices now look set
to test strong support around Dollars 1,215.

THE COMBINED production of tea in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh amounted
to 931.3m kg in 1992, down from 1,027.6m kg in the previous year.
While Indian and Sri Lankan production suffered major setbacks, output in
Bangladesh, a minor producer, rose by 3.1m kg to 48.3m kg. The worst
sufferer was Sri Lanka, which, because of bad weather and low productivity,
lost nearly 62m kg at 179m kg.
According to the Indian Tea Board, south India, which is in the same
climatic zone as Sri Lanka, accounted for 26.43m of the 37.79m kg drop in
the country's tea crop in 1992, which amounted to 703.9m kg. While the
production of tea in Assam fell marginally to 387.8m kg the gardens in West
Bengal lost 11.6m kg at 150.24m kg. Darjeeling in West Bengal, which has a
small production base but boasts of some of the finest teas in the world,
produced only 9.87m kg last year, compared with 13.07m kg in 1991. South
Indian production was 158.61m kg.
Following the virtual collapse of the Russian market, which until 1991 was
the destination of more than half of India's tea exports, the Indian tea
companies reduced the production of orthodox tea to 115.22m kg from 155.37m
kg. Production of CTC (crush, tear and curl) tea was raised to 581.28m kg.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG may compromise over mine
stake
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of Papua New Guinea yesterday indicated that it was willing
to compromise in a dispute with Australian mining groups over its
shareholding in the giant Porgera gold mine.
Mr Masket Iangalio, the mining and petroleum minister, told a conference in
Sydney that the government's 10 per cent stake was insufficient and claimed
that PNG citizens would become frustrated if it was not increased.
However, he said there was 'room for negotiation' on the government's demand
for a 30 per cent shareholding, which has been resisted by the joint venture
partners. Talks are to resume later this week between the government and
Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields and Highlands Gold, a PNG-registered
subsidiary of MIM Holdings, which each own 30 per cent of Porgera.
The government claimed last year that it had been misled about the potential
profitability of the mine, which began production in September 1990, and is
expected to produce about 900,000 troy ounces of gold a year.
Mr Iangalio said the government had reached understandings with the joint
venturers on most of the outstanding issues. 'We would love to have 30 per
cent, but if we feel comfortable about it then there is room for
negotiation,' he said.
The PNG government said it had captured the rebel stronghold of Arawa on
Bougainville island, where secessionist fighters have forced the closure of
the Panguna copper mine.
Mr Paias Wingti, Prime Minister, urged the rebel Bougainville Revolutionary
Army to abandon its four year fight for independence. However, rebel
representatives in the Solomon Islands said the government had captured only
part of the town. They said the BRA would fight on.
Up to 200 people have died in the fighting, and hundreds are feared to have
died from lack of medical supplies. The rebellion was triggered by protests
over royalty agreements with CRA, the Australian resources group which
operated the copper mine.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): UK
agriculture faces up to inevitability of change - A more realistic mood was
apparent at last week's annual meeting of the National Farmers' Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOUDEST and most spontaneous burst of applause at last week's annual
meeting of the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales came during a
debate on farmers' survival in the free market.
Some delegates had welcomed the challenge of unfettered competition with the
farmers of other countries. 'Give us a level playing field,' they declared,
'and we can compete with anybody in the world.' Then a delegate from the
back of the room went to the microphone. He introduced himself as an
international farmer from Kent and Brazil. 'Free trade and a level playing
field are illusions,' he said. 'If I told you the details of social and
environmental policies in Brazil I would make you weep. Suffice to say they
consist mainly of bullets, bulldozers and boxes of matches. Farmers in the
UK can never hope to compete with that and I don't advise them to try.'
The rousing response this received from most of those present indicated
clearly that they too wished to cling to some system of guaranteed prices
and/or protective tariff barriers for European Community countries to
insulate them from unfair competition from low cost producers. For there is
a fear among British farmers that the high costs, the safety standards and
the rules and regulations imposed on them are not shared by many of the
countries from which Britain accepts food imports.
But this was a rare moment among the two days of discussion. Most of the
rest of the event was carefully orchestrated to present an industry that was
prepared to confront and accept change; to take greater responsibility for
its own market making and to avoid public whingeing.
For, notwithstanding the fact that in spite of a small rise in UK average
farm incomes in 1992, they are still only half what they were in real terms
10 years ago, there is a different mood in the NFU of the 1990s to that
which prevailed a decade ago. At least there is among the leaders of the
union. It is taking a little longer to reach the shires but if last week's
meeting is an accurate guide it is getting there.
This new mood accepts that the government does not owe farmers a living;
that there is not enough cash around to guarantee such security anyway, even
if there were a shortage of food - which there is not. It recognises that
this is an age in which expectations of market forces and expanding free
trade dominate political thinking. It is acutely aware that alongside all
this it is necessary to show that farmers care for the environment.
The tone is set by Mr David Naish who was re-elected president of the union
for a third one-year term last week. A consummate politician, aware of the
need to play to the gallery at times, he takes every opportunity to
castigate government ministers over their parsimony towards British farmers
in comparison with of other EC ministers.
Such actions as the reduction, by Britain alone in the EC, of special
payments to hard-pressed hill farmers and the confiscation of the Pounds
750,000 residue of a pig producers' own fund for the elimination of Aujeskys
disease in the UK, gave him sticks with which to beat Mr David Curry, junior
agriculture minister, when he visited the annual meeting. So thoroughly did
Mr Naish do it, in fact, that his members gave him a standing ovation.
In spite of that personal success however, the president clearly has other
priorities. The first, and one for which delegates also applauded him
loudly, is to ensure that British farmers do not face unfair competition .
And that is as likely to come from inside the EC as from outside it, he
implied.
He spoke particularly of the danger that British milk quotas might be cut in
order to accommodate increases in Italian quotas; and that after Italy has
virtually ignored the restrictions on production, without penalty, since
milk quotas were introduced in 1984. He complained at the complexity and
cost of complying with UK bureaucracy in order to claim new headage payments
for a reduced national beef herd and asked, rhetorically, whether Greek
peasant farmers really had to do the same. And so on in that vein.
But during his keynote speech he concentrated mainly on the changes
agriculture faces following common agricultural policy reform; the
uncertainties, still, of what a deal in the General agreement on Tariffs and
Trade might mean; and the challenges and opportunities these could bring to
those farmers who were energetic and sharp enough to exploit them.
Doubtless this reflected the fact that he has accepted an invitation from
the prime minister to chair a working party to address the problem of the
UK's food trade gap - now standing at some Pounds 6bn per year. It was also
an acknowledgment that farmers must, in future, derive their incomes from a
variety of sources.
Of these the market-place will be the most important. Increasingly it will
be a market that is relatively unsupported compared to the past; hence the
need for farmers to find and develop the best outlets for quality
commodities that consumers demand rather than assume that the government or
the EC will bail them out.
Alongside that there will still be a vital role for government to play. For
even the most aggressive EC officials and Gatt negotiators do not press for
total abolition of farm support. A substantial proportion of farm income
will still come, therefore, from the government and the EC although these
will be increasingly tied to set-aside schemes to reduce production and to
encourage positive environmental management.
It is up to every farmer to work out the most profitable mix of these income
sources for his circumstances. Some will wish to follow old instincts and go
for maximum production hoping that market prices will enable them to make a
profit. Others, who may be less ambitious or have lower-quality land, will
opt for the extensification approach - that is farming less intensively,
taking extra special care of the environment and hoping that government
compensation payments will make up the deficit.
The president of the NFU is trying to prepare and galvanise his members for
these changes and challenges. But many farmers are conservative by nature
and cling to old values. Some of them will leave adaptation to the new
conditions until it is too late. Indeed some have already done so and it is
estimated that about 100 UK farmers are going out of business each week.
But that, of course, is what free trade and market forces are all about.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC banana curb sparks German
court threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OUTRAGED GERMAN banana importers yesterday said they would appeal to the
European Court of Justice in Luxembourg against the European Community
decision to restrict Latin American imports.
The German importers said the new EC regime, agreed in the early hours of
Saturday, would kill 50 per cent of their business and make bananas sold in
Germany 30 per cent more expensive.
They said they would turn to the European Court of Justice as well as to
national courts within the community and would encourage Latin American
countries to challenge the issue within the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. Banana importers in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium, are also
expected to turn to the European court of justice.
In Bonn, Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the coalition member Free Democrats,
called the EC regime 'an unbelievable piece of protectionism'. A government
official said the matter would be looked into the coming days.
Meanwhile, Mr Eduard Lintner, the German government's top anti-drug
official, told a local paper the move would boost cocaine importers and deal
a 'catastrophic' blow to the anti-drug fight in Europe.
EC farm ministers agreed in the early hours of Saturday that imports of
bananas from Latin America, the so-called dollar bananas, should be
restricted to 2m tonnes a year at a tariff of a Ecu100 (Pounds 82) a tonne.
Imports above that limit will be charged at the rate of Ecu850 a tonne.
The new regime aims to protect higher-cost producers in territories with
close links to EC member states, such as former colonies.
Local papers echoed the outcry of producers when readers woke up yesterday
to articles denouncing 'the crooked thing about the banana'. Germans are
especially fond of the cheap fruit, consuming more of it than any fellow
Europeans. Of the 3.6m tonnes of bananas imported into the EC last year,
2.7m tonnes came from Latin American countries, and these were nearly
entirely sold in Germany.
The banana became a symbol of reunification as eastern Germans were handed
the fruit by their western countrymen after the Berlin Wall had been torn
down. Eastern German per capita consumption is 28 kg a year, compared with
18 kg in the western part.

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: IMI raises Dollars 200m in
seven-year loan deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISTITUTO Mobiliare Italiano (IMI), the Italian financial group, is raising a
Dollars 200m seven-year loan, the first substantial deal for an Italian
state-controlled borrower since Efim, the state industrial holding group,
went into liquidation last July.
Bankers said the deal was a key test of sentiment towards Italian borrowers,
which until recently have been virtually barred from the syndicated loans
market, as a result of the Efim debacle.
A recent flurry of deals consisted mainly of small transactions for
financial institutions. Mediocredito Lombardo, Istituto Nazionale per il
Credito Edilizio and Monte dei Paschi di Siena were among those that have
recently tapped the market.
Because they are constrained to match the maturity of their borrowings to
their assets, Italian financial institutions face heavy medium-term
financing needs, which are divided between the domestic bond market, the
international bond market and the syndicated loans market.
Italian and foreign banks are still owed L9,500bn (Dollars 6.1bn) following
Efim's collapse. After initially proposing to repay the loans using bonds
with below-market interest rates, the Treasury bowed to pressure from the
banks and agreed to full repayment, which creditor banks are hoping to start
to receive towards the end of April.
Nevertheless, some banks remain ill-disposed towards lending to Italian
state borrowers.
However, IMI does not appear to be paying punitive rates. It will pay
interest of 0.35 point over the six-month London interbank offered rate for
the first five years, rising to  3/8 -point over Libor.
Repayment will be in 11 six-monthly instalments after an initial two-year
grace period. The commitment fee is 17 1/2 basis points.
The deal, arranged by ABN-Amro, is fully underwritten.

launches Pounds 50m debenture

<TEXT>
PEABODY TRUST, a UK housing association, added to the supply of secured
bonds in the domestic market with a Pounds 50m, 25-year debenture issue.
The bonds, secured on housing estates in London, have a coupon of 10 1/4 per
cent and were priced yesterday to yield 165 basis points over the 8 3/4 per
cent gilts due 2017. The money is being raised in part to help finance the
purchase of empty housing, part of government initiatives launched last
year. It will also be used to repay existing bank debt.
Covenants in the issue include provisions that allow investors greater
access to information about the company. This and similar covenants in other
recent issues have been prompted by concern at the failure of a debenture
issue from London &amp; Provincial, which was repaid early at less than face
value.

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Bank of England faces
pressure for auction timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England continues to face pressure to set an official calendar
for its auctions of UK government bonds, as investors press for a
predictable timetable similar to those in the US and France, according to
the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin*.
The Bank says that its survey of around 70 investing institutions, both
domestic and overseas, indicated that while most are satisfied with the way
in which the gilt market operates, some were keen that 'the authorities
should move from the current discretionary auction timetable to a
pre-announced auction calendar'.
However, the Bank argues there is an 'advantage to both the authorities and
the market as a whole in retaining an element of flexibility in the
execution of the funding programme, particularly with regard to tap sales as
a supplement to the auction programme'.
It says the current arrangement allows it to respond to market conditions.
For example, immediately after the Conservative victory in the April general
election, demand for gilts was very strong and the Bank sold an estimated
Pounds 3bn-Pounds 5bn of stock through the night and the following day.
The bulletin points to 'an encouraging degree of satisfaction among the
investor community with the gilt market-making service provided by the GEMMs
(gilt-edged market-makers)', and says that the approach to funding received
broad support from investors.
The Bank held five gilt auctions in 1992 for a combined amount of Pounds
12bn (nominal), representing just under 40 per cent of the total stock
issued.
The total nominal value of gilt-edged stock outstanding rose from Pounds
122.4bn at the end of 1991 to Pounds 144.1bn at the end of 1992. This
exceeds the previous peak of Pounds 141bn in March 1988.
The Bank noted an increase in the market's holdings of long-dated
conventional gilts - from 8.2 per cent to 13.7 per cent of total holdings -
which was offset by falls in short- and medium-dated issues.
'The decision to concentrate new issues in longer-dated maturities was
influenced by good demand for such stocks from domestic institutional
investors, which were the major buyers of gilts in the course of 1992 as
they sought to increase their holdings of gilts and to lengthen their
portfolios,' the Bank says. Investors sought to maximise capital gains as
interest rates fell by buying long-dated issues.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Long-dated gilts continue Friday's rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG-DATED UK government bonds ended about a quarter of a point higher,
continuing the rally seen on Friday after the release of
better-than-expected inflation figures.
The drop in the headline inflation rate to 1.7 per cent in January, from 2.6
per cent in December, prompted a surge in gilt prices on Friday. Long-dated
issues continued to climb yesterday, and outperformed short-dated gilts,
resulting in a further flattening of the yield curve. Four gilt taps
amounting to Pounds 800m, which were announced by the Bank of England on
Friday afternoon, were sold out yesterday.
The 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 rose  5/16 to 101 1/16 , to yield 8.645 per
cent against 8.676 per cent. Short-dated gilts ended lower or unchanged,
while the Liffe gilt futures contract ended the day unchanged at 102.23,
having been as high as 102.28.
ITALIAN government bonds picked up as political tensions eased and dealers
covered their short positions. Bond prices closed off the highs of the day
on profit-taking.
Hopes that yesterday's auction of three- and five-year bonds would be
well-supported also helped to buoy the market, dealers said, although they
pointed out that most of the demand for the L6,000bn of paper was expected
to come from domestic rather than overseas investors.
On Liffe, the March BTP contract overcame resistance at 96.50 to end the day
at 96.64, compared with Friday's close of 96.35.
THE 30-year Dutch government bond outperformed other issues as public
trading in the stripped bond began yesterday.
The agency for the ministry of finance announced a new market in stripped
30-year bonds - where interest and principal are separated to create zero
coupon bonds - earlier this month. The 30-year bond ended 35 basis points
higher at 104.95 on its first day's trade to yield 7.10 per cent.
The ministry of finance agency said it had allotted Fl 1.8bn of its 7.5 per
cent bond due 2023 for stripping, out of a total of Fl 4.5 bn.
ELSEWHERE in Europe, trading was lacklustre. German government bond prices
moved in a narrow range, as market participants awaited the release of the
January M3 data, as well as this week's repo and the Bundesbank council
meeting on Thursday. With the US markets closed for a national holiday,
dealers said volumes in the European markets were relatively low.
JAPANESE government bonds closed weaker, as investors took profits after
last week's strong rally in the cash and futures markets.
The June futures contract opened at 109.61 and traded down to a low of
109.48 before closing at 109.50. The benchmark No 145 JGB opened with a
yield of 4.205 per cent, corresponding to the high price of the day, and
closed at 4.22 per cent. Dealers noted some bond-buying by the Bank of
Japan, but said the market had edged lower on profit-taking.
WITH effect from today, the government bond table will include the Treasury
7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998, instead of the Conversion 10 per cent bond due
1996.

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Bonds: World Bank adds to stream of Canadian
dollar issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL demand for Canadian dollar bonds remained strong yesterday as
the World Bank added to the stream of issues in recent weeks with a CDollars
250m offering of its own.
The bank's five-year issue, which sold out quickly and went to a premium in
early trading, took the total amount of Canadian dollar bonds issued this
year to more than CDollars 6.5bn.
Quebec's first global bond offering, a 30-year deal to raise at least
CDollars 1bn, and reports of another prime name looking to borrow in the
currency, are likely to keep the Canadian dollar at the centre of attention
for some days to come.
The World Bank's issue, priced to yield 23 basis points over five-year
Canadian government bonds, was sold out before the Canadian market opened,
meeting strong demand in the Far East and Europe.
In the afternoon in London, the bonds were bid at 99.65, comfortably above
their 99.54 reoffered price. With the Canadian government market performing
strongly, the spread narrowed to around 22 basis points at the end of the
day.
The strength of the Canadian dollar swap market owes much to continuing
demand from issuers. Yesterday's World Bank deal, which is believed to have
been swapped, depressed the spread on five-year swaps slightly to around 70
basis points. Even at that level, though, the market is considered
attractive: a borrower able to issue bonds at a yield spread of 50 basis
points over the government market, for instance, would achieve a borrowing
cost of 20 basis points under Libor.
Quebec's global bond issue was said by lead managers Merrill Lynch and
Scotia McLeod to have met strong demand from insurance companies and pension
funds in the US and Canada. The bonds are expected to be formally launched
once the US market reopens today, with a yield spread of approaching 90
basis points.
Sanwa joined the growing number of Japanese banks to increase their
regulatory capital by issuing perpetual floating-rate notes, through Sanwa
Finance Aruba.
In a structure similar to that used by other banks, the Dollars 300m of
notes carry a margin of 75 basis points for the first five years, rising
eventually to 175 basis points after 10 years. The bank can call the issue
after five years.
Such paper is generally considered an expensive option for the banks, though
it is still said to be cheaper at present than raising money through
subordinated loans from Japanese insurance companies, an alternative source
of tier two capital.

THE BANK of Osaka, a leading Japanese regional bank, yesterday announced
plans to reduce its workforce by about 20 per cent over the next three years
in an attempt to cope with a large bad-loan burden inherited from an
affiliate.
The bank's difficulties are similar to those of other regional banks that
rapidly expanded property lending during the late 1980s, and are now finding
that they have growing problems with non-performing loans.
Speculative property development was particularly frenetic on the fringes of
Osaka, leaving several banks, including Hyogo Bank, based in a neighbouring
prefecture, with deep financial wounds.
Bank of Osaka's biggest problem has been the loose financial management at
Daigin Finance, a so-called non-bank affiliate at which an estimated 40 per
cent of the property loans are non-performing.
The bank said that the restructuring, through which it hopes to cut expenses
of about Y3bn (Dollars 24.8m) a year, would enable it to make a 'smooth
rescue' of Daigin Finance.
In addition to reducing its 2,100 employees through retirement and reduced
recruitment, the bank is to close or consolidate eight branches and cut
executive salaries and bonuses for the year to the end of March.
Hanshin Bank has asked creditors not to call in loans extended to its
affiliate non-bank financial institution Hanshin Sogo Finance, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
Hanshin is asking about 30 financial institutions - including Sakura Bank,
Industrial Bank of Japan and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan - to maintain
their loans outstanding to Hanshin Sogo over the next five years or so in
order to help it improve asset quality.
The bank will also increase its loans to Hanshin Sogo to Y10bn from the
current Y3bn, and cut the interest rate on the loans to zero, it said.

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ube takes stake in BP chemicals
subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UBE Industries, the leading Japanese producer of materials for the nylon
industry, is to acquire 30 per cent of Proquimed, a Spanish chemicals
subsidiary of British Petroleum. Terms of the deal, an unusual move by a
Japanese company, were not disclosed.
Proquimed, which manufactures caprolactam, a raw material for nylon, has an
annual turnover of about Dollars 80m a year. BP acquired it as part of its
purchase of Petromed, Spain's third largest oil refiner and retailer, in
1991. The plant, capable of manufacturing about 54,000 tonnes of caprolactam
a year, was kept with BP's oil division rather than being moved to BP
Chemicals.
Ube said the deal will include the transfer of its technology to the Spanish
company to upgrade the production of caprolactam. The Japanese group is one
of the world leaders in caprolactam manufacture. The plant employs about 300
people.
As with most other Japanese chemicals companies, Ube's sales have fallen in
tandem with the slowing of the economy, and it is expected to report a
pre-tax loss of about Y5bn (Dollars 40m) for the year ending in March, a
sharp turnaround from a profit Y12.7bn last year.
Ube is also a leading producer of cement and has an extensive machinery
division, but has been hurt by rapid expansion during the late 1980s, and is
now restructuring its operations. It has already stopped production of some
building materials.
The difficult domestic market conditions have encouraged the company, for
which exports account for 19 per cent of sales, to broaden its international
base. Ube expects the purchase of the stake in Proquimed will enable it to
secure supplies of caprolactam for the still growing Asian market without
the need for costly capital investment in Japan.

FOSTER'S Brewing, the Australian beer, pastoral and finance group, yesterday
announced a 126 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 173m (USDollars
116m) for the six months ended December 1992.
The group said the 'solid performance' marked the beginning of a period of
consolidation following its four-year restructuring programme, which
culminated in a net loss of ADollars 951m in the year ended last June.
However, the improvement in net profit was struck after an abnormal profit
of ADollars 18m, against an abnormal loss of ADollars 91m in the comparable
period a year ago.
The increase in net profit also masked a 15 per cent fall in pre-tax profit
to ADollars 157m, caused mainly by a 9 per cent fall in the contribution
from the core brewing operations.
The group cut the interim dividend from 3 cents to 2.75 cents, unfranked,
but the board said it was confident that the second-half dividend could be
increased to 3.25 cents, of which 2.5 cents would be franked.
This would enable the group to achieve the directors' dividend forecast in
the prospectus for last year's ADollars 1bn rights issue, which helped
reduce debt from ADollars 4.1bn to ADollars 2.8bn.
Mr Ted Kunkel, chief executive, said the board was confident that provisions
made last year were adequate, despite the 'tough' outlook for the group's
loss-making finance business, which it is trying to sell.
He said Foster's would continue its efforts to refocus on its core brewing
activities - Carlton United in Australia, Courage in the UK, and 40 per cent
of Molson Breweries in Canada.
'The general outlook in our three main markets . . . is still uncertain at
best, but Foster's has in place the operational structure necessary for a
tough, competitive environment,' he added.
At the operating level, Carlton reported a 9 per cent cut in profit to
ADollars 101m; Courage was down 11 per cent to ADollars 131m after a
ADollars 18m contribution to the Courage Pension Fund; and Molson's
contribution fell by 6 per cent to ADollars 70m.
The group said sales volumes fell by 4.4 per cent in Australia, 5 per cent
in the UK and 3.7 per cent in Canada. Overall, sales fell by 3 per cent to
ADollars 5.1bn.
However, the Elders subsidiary, which consists of the group's residual
agribusiness operations, reported an 'outstanding' profit of ADollars 5m
following a series of losses.

25%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IMPALA Platinum, the world's second largest producer, saw earnings tumble by
25 per cent in the six months ended December, as weak prices negated
improved production.
Income from platinum mining fell 38 per cent to R137.6m (Dollars 44.2m) and
net attributable earnings fell to R93.6m from R124.7m. The dividend is being
cut from 55 cents a share to 45 cents.
Tax was lower but income from associates fell 66 per cent, with both Western
and Eastern Platinum not paying a dividend. Earnings per share fell by 25
per cent to 150 cents.
Impala seems to have overcome recent production and industrial relations
problems. Mr Michael McMahon, managing director, said: 'We think we have
fixed everything that is fixable at Implats.'
A 6 per cent increase in recoveries from the refinery contributed to Impala
lifting refined platinum production by 46 per cent to 559,000 ounces. Total
operating costs of producing an ounce of platinum fell by 22.5 per cent to
R1,548 per ounce compared to the same period in 1991.
Although platinum sales rose by 16 per cent from 1991, and rhodium sales by
33 per cent, soft prices saw revenue per ounce of platinum sold decline by
nearly 18 per cent.

EASTMAN Chemicals International (ECI), a subsidiary of Eastman Kodak, the US
maker of consumer photographic products, plans to build a chemicals
manufacturing plant in Asia by 1995 and invest in several more, Reuter
reports from Singapore.
Mr Ernest Deavenport, ECI president, told a conference in Singapore that his
company had so far announced a polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG)
plant and this was the first of a planned series of investments in the Asia
Pacific region.
'Our vision for the Asia Pacific region is to have a very substantial sales
presence here and as a result of that have a very substantial manufacturing
presence,' he said.
'For every dollar of sales, we have a dollar of investment, and we plan to
grow our sales in this region from 10 to 15 per cent of a total of USDollars
4bn, to the neighbourhood of 20 per cent or more of a much larger company,'
he said.
ECI's first Asia plant would require between USDollars 40m and USDollars
100m in investment, de-pending on projected annual PETG output of 30,000 to
80,000 tonnes. The size and location of the plant would be decided by
August. Possible locations included Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and
Malaysia.

PROVENTUS, the Swedish investment group, has bought a 39.4 per cent stake in
Aritmos, one of the world's leading sport and leisure companies, for SKr730m
(Dollars 101m).
The acquisition for an average price of SKr85.50 per share makes Proventus
the largest single shareholder in Aritmos. The investment company has bought
the stake of KF, the co-operative group, which with 25 per cent was
previously Aritmos's biggest shareholder, and has made further purchases in
the market.
Aritmos's brands include Puma, one of the world's leading suppliers of
soccer footwear, Etonic, the second largest supplier of golf footwear in the
US and Tretorn, the world's leading supplier of 'pressureless' tennis balls.
Other units cover angling equipment, gardening machines and bicycles.
Mr Mikael Kamras, Proventus president, said the group intended to be an
active shareholder in Aritmos, and would be seeking board representation.
'We believe the group has a long-term possibility to be really profitable,
despite the tough market conditions which have depressed the company's
recent profitability,' he said.
In 1991 Aritmos, which is based in Helsingborg in southern Sweden, achieved
SKr201m in income after financial items on turnover of SKr5.82bn.
In the first eight months of last year, income after financial items reached
SKr156m on turnover of SKr3.61bn. More than three quarters of the group's
turnover is outside Sweden, primarily in Europe and the US. The group's
current market capitalisation is SKr1.93bn.
The purchase has halved Proventus's previous liquidity level of SKr1.5bn.

builders

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE downturn in the French construction industry left a number of the
country's largest building and building materials groups with reduced sales
last year.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the utility group that has been plagued by
problems at its Dumez construction subsidiary, mustered turnover of
FFr89.15bn (Dollars 16.63bn) last year, compared with FFr87.67bn in 1991, a
fall in real terms.
Lyonnaise recently warned of a fall in net profits of between 60 per cent
and 70 per cent from 1991's FFr1.17bn.
Lafarge Coppee, the world's largest building materials supplier, has also
been affected by the problems of the construction sector.
It saw sales fall to FFr30.45bn last year from FFr31.65bn in 1991. It has
been hit hardest in the US and in the French cement market.
Guintoli, one of the construction companies embroiled in the scandal of
Ciments Francais' off-balance sheet dealings, saw its sales fall by 3.3 per
cent to FFr1.5bn in 1992 from FFr1.55bn in 1991.
Guintoli was taken over by the Paribas banking group late last year after it
emerged that Ciments Francais had secretly raised its holding in the
company.
The problems of the construction sector were underlined by the announcement
that Formica plans to cut costs by shedding 45 of its 400 employees in
France.
Its French plants have been on short-time working since October.

STELCO, one of Canada's two biggest steelmakers, did better than expected in
the final quarter of 1992, with shipments up 24 per cent to the best level
in more than two years.
Prices stabilised and about 25 per cent of Stelco's output went to the US
market
The quarter's loss was CDollars 4m (USDollars 3.1m) or 10 cents a share
against a loss of CDollars 38m or 51 cents a share a year earlier, on
revenues of CDollars 549m against CDollars 500m.
The latest period included 50 cents a share in tax recoveries.
For all 1992, the net loss came to CDollars 127m or CDollars 1.76 a share
against CDollars 136m or CDollars 3.05 a share in 1991.
Sales slipped to CDollars 2bn from CDollars 2.2bn
Stelco generated positive cash flow in the fourth quarter and is expected to
avoid any financial restructuring even though its balance sheet remains
strained.
The company warned that in spite of better demand from the car and energy
sectors and a recent run-up in the price of its stock, uncertainties
remained - not least because of the US anti-dumping duties.
It may therefore not be able to maintain shipments to the US at present
levels.
Algoma Steel, the troubled Ontario-based company owned by Canada's other
large steelmaker, Dofasco, lost CDollars 74m or CDollars 2.96 a share in the
seven months ended December 31 on sales of CDollars 429m.
Algoma, which itself is Canada's third biggest steel producer, has been
broadly restructured by Dofasco since it was acquired in 1987 from Canadian
Pacific.
Warburg Pincus, a CDollars 3bn investment management group, is putting
CDollars 40m into SHL Systemhouse, the Ottawa-based computer systems
integrator, by buying 4.5m SHL shares at CDollars 9 a share.
SHL will use the money to expand further in the US and Europe.

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Report calls for accounting
harmonisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTS of companies in continental Europe are becoming less
conservative and more likely to flatter profits, according to a research
report from NatWest Securities, the research and brokerage arm of National
Westminster Bank, UK clearer.
Based on an analysis of large European companies in Germany, France, Italy,
Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands, the research house calls for faster
progress towards harmonisation of accounting practices and tighter rules.
It warns that until standards are more uniform, investors need to be wary of
differing accounting practices.
'Profits are certainly widely understated where the tax authorities are more
of a threat than equity markets,' it says.
'The blanket assumption that continental European accounts are conservative
is becoming dangerous.'
Among the practices NatWest highlights are:
Revaluation upwards of assets on the balance sheet, including Total,
Olivetti and Philips.
Depreciation, which is accelerated in Germany and Switzerland to shelter
profits from the tax authorities.
Capitalisation of intangible assets on the balance sheet, such as interest
costs by Sevillana, development costs by Euro Disney and the inclusion of
trademarks by Pinault-Printemps.
Goodwill written down to a substantially degree, such as at Alcatel, which
allows it to be released from reserves into the profit and loss account in
the future.
Provisions and reserves, which can help smooth and adjust profits.
The report criticises the poor disclosure of German banks, and highlights
high restructuring provisions at Philips.
Long-term contracts which can be treated in different ways which makes
comparisons difficult.
Joint ventures and associates, which can be treated in different ways and
can delay the revaluation of profits.
Off balance sheet finance such as leasing controlled 'non-subsidiaries',
used by companies such as Euro Disney.
Foreign currency translation, which is applied in divergent ways.
Extraordinary items, which are also defined in different ways in the
different countries.
Ms Marina Tzamouranis, who co-ordinated the research, said the racier
approaches to financial reporting were being driven by increased
cross-border transactions and the growing importance of equity markets.

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Recovery looks elusive for
Norway's banks - The crisis which has engulfed the sector shows few signs of
ending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis which has engulfed Norway's commercial banks for the past five
years shows few signs of abating.
The sector's annual profits reporting season, which begins today with Den
norske Bank's results, will carry a familiar tale - record write-offs and
high non-performing loans which could force fresh government rescue efforts.
Few analysts see any hope for recovery for between four and five years and
it is not difficult find those who believe the fall-out from the crisis will
last the decade.
The cost of the excessive expansion of the 1980s, which accompanied
deregulation of the country's banking system, is non-performing loans
estimated at NKr20bn (Dollars 2.8bn) and write-offs to date of NKr60bn on
the banks' property holdings.
Mr Finn Hvistendahl and Mr Borger Lenth, chief executives respectively of
Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, Norway's two biggest banks, believe
further firm action is needed to reverse the trend. They are reorganising
their corporate structures to separate the negative effects of
non-performing loans and falling property values from healthy parts of their
businesses. However, the state has already ruled out the possibility of
taking on these bad loans.
A senior executive at a leading US bank which provides funding to DnB and
Christiania said he did not expect recovery by either of the banks until the
end of the 1990s.
The Norwegian Banks Association, representing the commercial banks,
increased its forecast of members' 1992 composite losses from NKr3bn to
between NKr4bn and NKr5bn and warned that some banks might also need state
cash this year.
Norwegian state cash transfers to support the banks from collapse have
totalled more than NKr20bn in the last five years. The banks' own insurance
fund has also been emptied by injections of NKr7.4bn into the sector, of
which NKr7.2bn has been written off as losses. Last November, the
state-backed Bank Insurance Fund agreed to pump NKr5bn into DnB, Christiania
and Fokus Bank, the third biggest commercial bank. The association says
combined credit losses last year probably fell to between NKr8bn and NKr9n
from 1991's record NKr15bn.
The one bright spot is that the banks will show slightly improved operating
results for 1992 but they seem set in the medium-term to remain saddled with
non-performing assets until allowed to hive them off into separate entities
to stop the drain on operating income.
The association estimates that property acquired by the banks last year due
to defaults had a value of NKr7bn, representing a loss of income of NKr3bn.
At the nine-month mark DnB posted a net loss of NKr2.46bn and credit losses
of NKr3.29bn, while Christiania's net loss was NKr785m with credit losses of
NKr1.86bn.
Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, Norway's finance minister, says he is open to
proposals from individual banks for restructuring which could allow the
establishment of subsidiaries into which non-performing loans could be
off-loaded.
DnB is considering establishing a holding company structure under which a
so-called 'good bank', comprising its healthy operations, would be
established. A 'project bank' would be created to hold non-performing loans,
high-risk loans and property acquired by the bank which served as collateral
for loans which became non-performing.
DnB has about NKr10bn in non-performing loans, acquired property valued at
NKr3bn and NKr3bn in property it owns. Together, the three portfolios
accounted for about 10 per cent of its assets at the end of 1992.
Christiania is considering a similar move and has already begun an internal
reorganisation.
'We have to try to clear out the attic in a way in which we can make
sufficient write-downs on bad loans so that we can wind them up either
through refinancing or recapitalising the companies which are having
problems servicing loans,' Mr Lenth said recently.
He insists Christiania's problems are no longer of an operational nature.
'As long as we can carry the costs of our non-performing loans, our first
priority will be to recover as much as possible from such loans,' he says.
But Norway's corporate sector is plagued by an inability to raise equity
capital in a market which has been downtrodden by several years' weakness in
the domestic economy and poor export earnings caused by feeble international
economic growth.
Mr Hvistendahl, Mr Lenth and the finance minister are cautiously optimistic
about the prospects for the development of Norway's economy in 1993, but not
one of the three is willing to predict when the banks can be reprivatised.
Christiania is fully state-owned and with last year's rescue action, the
state owns more than 70 per cent of DnB's share capital.
'It is inconceivable to my mind that we could have private capital flowing
into the banks in the near future. Not before a period of stable income
could we think of going to the stock market to raise capital,' Mr Lenth
believes.

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Paribas banks on a clear break
in the storm clouds - Alice Rawsthorn examines the tasks facing the bank's
chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rue d'Antin, in the banking district of Paris, is clouded by Paribas'
troubles. The bank, still reeling from the shock of posting its first ever
loss, in 1991, is licking its wounds after another bruising year during
which the problems of the French economic slowdown were aggravated by the
scandal over the discovery of FFr1bn (Dollars 178m) of off-balance sheet
dealings at its associate, Ciments Francais.
Mr Andre Levy-Lang, the urbane investment banker who has chaired Paribas
since 1990, faces the task of clearing away the debris from the Ciments
Francais debacle and completing the process of restructuring his company.
'We had a tough time in 1992 and 1993 will be another difficult year,' he
said. 'But most of our problems are due to short term factors. We must keep
a long term perspective.'
When Mr Levy-Lang first became chairman his chief challenge was to hammer
out a long term structure for Paribas' labyrinthine mass of banking
activities and industrial investments. Mr Levy-Lang has made some changes by
pruning Paribas' portfolio of industrial investments and rationalising its
retail banking operations outside France.
Paribas is now composed of four divisions:
Banque Paribas, the investment bank which is one of the few French
institutions to be a serious player in the international marketplace
Compagnie Bancaire, the specialised financing company with a strong presence
in property
Credit du Nord, the French retail banking network, and
A portfolio of industrial investments including stakes in 200 companies.
If all had gone according to plan Mr Levy-Lang would now be concentrating on
strategic issues such as introducing Banque Paribas' new international
structure and encouraging cross-referals between the three banking
businesses. These issues are being addressed but he has also faced the
further challenge of repairing the damage caused by the economic squeeze.
All Paribas' banking businesses have been affected by the impact of high
French interest rates, which has dried up demand for credit and recently
produced steep increases in borrowing costs. Meanwhile, Credit du Nord and
Compagnie Bancaire have had to make hefty provisions on their exposure to
the depressed property markets both in France and the UK.
As a result the group went into the red in 1991, with a net loss of FFr184m
after provisions of FFr9.5bn. It clawed back into the black last year with
provisional net profits of FFr900m, but the 'recovery' was mainly due to
asset sales and Paribas still had to make provisions of FFr7.8bn.
But the real trauma of 1992 was the discovery that Ciments Francais - a
French cement company in which Paribas had sold control but was still a
significant shareholder - had made hefty losses on its off-balance sheet
dealings. Mr Pierre Conso, the cement company's chairman, has since resigned
but it plunged into the red with an estimated net loss of FFr1bn last year.
Paribas was left in the acutely embarrasing position of having to repay
FFr500m of the FFr6bn received earlier last year for selling control of
Ciments Francais to Italcementi of Italy. Its share of Ciments Francais
losses for 1992, estimated at FFr500m, will wipe out the remaining profit
from the sale.
Despite the scandal, Mr Levy-Lang maintains that Ciments Francais was still
'a very profitable investment for us over the years'. But the fiasco acts as
an apt illustration of the pitfalls of Paribas' strategy of taking sizeable
stakes in industrial companies as a long term investor, generally without
exerting managerial control.
Mr Levy-Lang accepts that such a scenario could happen again. 'What can you
do if the managers of a company are lying to the board and the auditors?' he
said. However, he is still committed to continuing to develop Paribas'
industrial portfolio with further investments in the future.
He is also keen to return to the more mundane business of engineering
Paribas' recovery.
Like most French bankers he suspects that the market has stabilised,
although the commercial property sector will remain fragile for a few more
years.
Paribas is now concentrating on improving productivity mainly by pooling
specific areas of activity such as cheque processing for the three banking
businesses and custodial functions for Credit du Nord and Banque Paribas.
The group is expected to increase profits this year, albeit slowly, with
Morgan Stanley forecasting modest growth from FFr900m to FFr1.2bn. 'We're
still a few years away from producing the kind of profits I would like to
see,' said Mr Levy-Lang. 'It won't happen overnight, but we'll get there.'

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Dutch government accepts terms
of Fokker takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUTCH government has accepted the terms set by Deutsche Aerospace for
its planned takeover of the Fokker aircraft manufacturer, the German company
said yesterday.
The final hurdle was overcome after Dasa, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz,
apparently offered a compromise proposal to its earlier plans for
redundancies and capacity and production cuts.
The deal, which must be approved by the companies' supervisory boards and
the European Commission's competition authorities, concludes a negotiating
round dogged by last-minute complications.
Most of the problems stemmed from Dasa's insistence that a provisional
agreement to take a 51 per cent stake in the Dutch group, signed last
October, should be renegotiated in the light of dete-riorating market
conditions.
Fokker shares lost a quarter of their value 10 days ago after the group
asked the state-owned Nationale Investeringsbank for a loan of up to Fl 1bn
(Dollars 534m), in case the takeover fell through.
'With this agreement almost 80 per cent of the funds made available
immediately by Dasa will go directly to Fokker,' the German company said in
a statement.
'The injection of more than Fl 900m into Fokker puts its financial future on
a secure foundation'.
However, the statement gave no details of the weekend offer on capacity and
job cuts which clinched the deal. Mr Koos Andriessen, the Dutch economics
minister, said last week that he could not accept Dasa's earlier demands for
'open-ended support' for redundancy programmes.
Under the terms of the deal approved in the Hague yesterday, Dasa will pay
Fl 30 each for 13.4m new Fokker shares. Meanwhile, the Dutch government's
31.8 per cent stake will be bought in two stages. The first tranche will be
bought immediately for Fl 30 a share, raising Fl 156m, and the second after
three years.
The price for the second tranche will depend on Fokker achieving certain
profit targets. Under the original agreement, Dasa undertook to pay Fl 37 a
share for its stake.
Yesterday's statement said the acquisition of the controlling share in a new
Fokker holding company was an important step on the way to building a
competitive regional aircraft business in Europe.
While the German group is anxious to develop a European consortium
specialising in regional and commuter aircraft, it has bargained hard to
avoid reliving the embarrasment it suffered when it bought the Dornier
business only to have to refinance it shortly afterwards.

FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Jefferson Smurfit in Dollars
500m debt offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US interests of Jefferson Smurfit, which were the subject of a complex
Dollars 2.9bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, are being refinanced through a
Dollars 500m public debt offering.
The Irish paper and packaging group intends to repay some of its US
associate's Dollars 1.7bn bank debt as part of its plans to float the
business in two years. A subsidiary of Smurfit will provide its US interests
with a Dollars 200m loan.
Mr Ray Curran, Smurfit's chief financial officer, said: 'This is an
important step on the road to positioning our US interests for an initial
public offer in 1995.'
The group's main US paper and paperboard interests were combined in a highly
leveraged deal in 1989. This involved the acquisition of Container
Corporation of America (CCA), a paperboard company Jefferson bought in the
mid-1980s, and Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (JSC), its St Louis-based
subsidiary, by a leveraged buy-out vehicle called SIBV/MS Holdings.
SIBV/MS Holdings, in turn, is 50 per cent cent-owned by Jefferson Smurfit,
and 50 per cent by an investor group led by Morgan Stanley.
The LBO deal netted Smurfit some Dollars 1bn in cash, and transformed its
balance sheet. But, since then it has been affected by recession.
JSC/CCA was last year refinanced via a Dollars 400m equity investment, in
cash and via the conversion of JSC's outstanding preferred stock.
The group decided to go for a second refinancing because it wanted to tap
the capital markets. Morgan Stanley is underwriting the debt offering.
Smurfit's loan to its US associate will help retire high-cost subordinated
debt. It will pay interest at 11 1/2 per cent when fully drawn and will save
JSC/CCA about Dollars 7m a year.
JSC/CAA has filed the senior notes, which mature in 2003, with the
Securities Exchange Commission in Washington.

FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Testing times for a company with global
ambitions - United Biscuits' drive to internationalise faces some big
challenges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU NEED not search far for clues to where United Biscuits, Britain's fourth
largest food manufacturer, thinks its future lies. They are emblazoned on
the cover of its annual report, which pictures UB products spilling across
much of the earth's surface.
Such global ambitions are a far cry from the parochial, UK- centred approach
which characterised the group under the autocratic 17-year chairmanship of
Sir (now Lord) Hector Laing. But since he retired two years ago, UB's
horizons have widened dramatically.
A youthful top management team, headed by Mr Eric Nicoli, the 42-year-old
chief executive, has set its sights squarely on transforming the group into
a world leader in biscuits and savoury snacks. The company has rapidly
expanded in continental Europe through a flurry of medium-sized acquisitions
and joint ventures, and recently acquired an Asian-Pacific bridgehead by
buying CCA Snacks in Australia. This year, for the first time, more than
half of group sales will be overseas.
Mr Nicoli and his team have impressed UB's shareholders with their
determination to impart a more coherent direction to a group which was once
notorious for haphazard, expensive - and often unrewarding - excursions into
unrelated businesses. They are also widely praised for their open and
collegiate management style.
'The main difference today is that we are much more focused, we have
identified geographic and product priorities and we are organised to make
expansion happen,' says Mr Nicoli. 'We firmly believe that a more
disciplined approach will result in fewer mistakes and a tighter strategy.'
Yet UB has still to convince many observers, notably in the City, that its
dash for growth will succeed. Not only does its drive to internationalise
face some big challenges; its past has an unfortunate habit of returning to
haunt it.
Much of Mr Nicoli's first year as chief executive was spent sorting out
problems at Ross Young's, the UK frozen food business acquired for Pounds
335m in 1988 in what is now admitted to have been an ill-conceived
diversification.
Then, last year, the roof fell in at Keebler, the US biscuits and snacks
maker owned by UB since 1974 and which accounts for a third of group sales.
Caught short by severe price competition in a recession-struck market,
Keebler's first-half profits fell 57 per cent, slicing 17 per cent off the
group's pre-tax results. Though action has been taken to cut costs, replace
top management and regain market share, Keebler's troubles will leave a deep
dent in the group's 1992 full-year results, due on March 18. Analysts
forecast pre-tax profit of about Pounds 160m, down from Pounds 211.3m the
previous year.
The experience has been chastening for a management which has worked hard to
establish a reputation for professionalism and tight control over the
business. 'It is very frustrating that we feel we are doing the right
things, our shareholders feel we are doing the right things and yet - albeit
temporarily - we go backwards,' Mr Nicoli says.
Despite these trials, UB continues to enjoy commanding strengths at home.
Though recession and cut-price competition have nibbled into UK sales of
McVitie's, its biscuit division, massive low-cost manufacturing capacity has
enabled it to retain a 43 per cent market share and handsome margins of
about 14 per cent.
KP Foods, while less profitable, has increased its share of the British
snacks market from 30 to 40 per cent in the past decade, thanks to
successful product innovation and heavy marketing spending. It now claims to
have overtaken Pepsico of the US, owner of Smiths and Walkers, as UK market
leader.
But since the late-1980s, UB has increasingly recognised that scope for
further expansion at home is limited. Its search for fresh sources of growth
has focused primarily on continental Europe, where it has made nine
acquisitions and formed three joint ventures in the past three years.
A third of McVitie's sales now come from continental Europe, up from 8 per
cent five years ago, while profits there rose 26 per cent to Pounds 15.6m in
the 12 months to June. Much of the profit gain has come from one-off steps
to rationalise production and distribution, but McVitie's says 10 per cent
margins should be sustainable in the longer run.
At KP, half of sales this year will be overseas, compared with a fifth five
years ago, and the division is now one of the top two in each of the
European markets in which it competes.
However, the rapid growth which made Continental snack markets so attractive
in the late-1980s has tailed off sharply, while heavy marketing costs have
held margins on KP's continental businesses to 5 per cent, half the UK
level.
Mr David Hearn, KP's managing director, expects this performance to improve,
but adds: 'It will take a long time to achieve 10 per cent margins on the
Continent because we are always in an investment phase in one market or
another.'
However, despite its recent spending spree, UB still accounts for only 11
per cent of the Pounds 8.6bn European biscuit market. That is barely half
the share of BSN of France, which out-manoeuvred UB in 1988 to buy the
extensive European food businesses of Nabisco of the US, the world's biggest
biscuit maker.
In the European snacks sector, which is less mature than biscuits, UB's
strengths are more evenly matched with those of Pepsico.
The US company also has an uneven marketing record in Europe. But with
snacks sales of Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.7bn) against KP's Pounds 504m, and
with far higher margins, Pepsico has more room for mistakes than its smaller
rival.
Mr Nicoli dismisses such comparisons, arguing that the size of total sales
matters less than strength in individual markets. However, UB is a leader
only in the relatively small markets of Scandinavia and the Benelux
countries. It still has no business in Germany and only a marginal presence
in France and Italy.
In several larger European countries, it relies on local partners to
distribute its products. Though a low-cost route to the market, such
partnerships cannot confer the same degree of control and profits which full
ownership can provide. They can also be unstable, as McVitie has found since
it agreed last year to form a joint sales company in Spain with Royal
Brands, part of the state-owned Tabacalera group.
Eight months later, a friendly bid by Nabisco for Royal Brands has put the
future of that link-up in doubt. Nabisco's return to Europe has also
prompted speculation that UB might eventually be among its targets.
Meanwhile, industry observers are unsure about Keebler's longer term
prospects. Mr Nicoli expects the corrective measures taken so far, along
with tighter management and a revamped marketing strategy, to bring a
recovery in its performance this year.
However, Keebler remains a distant number two in the US to Nabisco, whose
superior scale and margins rendered it far less vulnerable to the recent
price war.
In an effort to boost volumes, UB recently spent Pounds 47m to acquire Bake
Line, a leading US producer of private label biscuits for supermarkets - a
fast-growing business in the past few years.
UB is confident that this growth will continue - though some in the American
food industry believe it is a temporary pheno-menon due largely to
recession.
Whether or not UB yet possesses the size and weight to compete effectively
in the international big league, it is unlikely to continue adding
businesses at its recent rate. With gearing at 88 per cent, scope for
further acquisitions will remain limited unless it makes a sizeable disposal
or a rights issue.
Neither option looks particularly realistic at present. The most obvious
disposal candidate is Ross Young's. But past talks with potential buyers
have got nowhere, and industry observers doubt that the business would fetch
much more than half the roughly Pounds 450m UB has invested in it over the
years.
The Terry's chocolate division, which has recently performed strongly
despite the UK recession, might attract more interest. But it is relatively
small, with 1991 sales of Pounds 153m.
Nor does a rights issue look practical while UB's share price continues to
languish at about 360p, well below last year's high of 442p - least of all
at a time when a queue of other companies is lining up for cash calls.
In any case, even the most sympathetic observers believe that after the
recent alarms and excursions, the group now needs a period of consolidation.
As a fund manager with one of UB's larger institutional shareholders puts
it: 'We're impressed by the management team's strategy in continental Europe
and their aggressive attitude to costs. But they have still to prove
themselves in a serious way over the longer term. How they come through the
current year will be a real test of their performance.'

FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Biotechnology sector welcomes SE rule
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK biotechnology industry has welcomed proposed changes in Stock
Exchange rules which would make it easier for young pharmaceutical companies
to obtain a full listing.
The BioIndustry Association, a trade body with 180 members ranging from
small biotech start-ups to large companies, said the proposed relaxation in
rules 'may encourage Britain's biotechnology industry to raise funds here
rather than having to go to the US.'
The period of consultation on the new rules for 'companies without an
adequate record' ended yesterday and the Stock Exchange is expected to
introduce them later this year.
They would allow a pharmaceutical company that had been in existence for
three years to seek a listing even if it had no products on sale, so long as
it had at least two new drugs in clinical trials.
However, Mr Louis Da Gama, executive director of the BioIndustry
Association, said non-pharmaceutical biotechnology companies - such as those
aiming at agricultural markets - were not happy with the proposed changes,
which would continue to exclude them from a listing. 'Already some of our
members have gone to the US to meet their current needs and more may follow
their lead,' he said.
So far only one UK biotech company - Oxford-based British Biotechnology -
has obtained a full London listing. Others have taken advantage of the less
restrictive Nasdaq listing rules in the US.

FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation at HQ of ICI drugs offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENECA Pharmaceuticals, the drugs arm of Imperial Chemical Industries, is
reorganising its international research headquarters at Alderley Park,
Cheshire.
The site employs some 700 researchers, representing about 70 cent of
Zeneca's research effort. The group last year spent Pounds 257m on research
and development and expects to spend up to Pounds 300m this year.
The change is aimed at increasing the group's impact in its chosen
therapeutic areas, according to Dr Tom McKillop, deputy chief executive. The
reorganisation involves setting up four new departments dealing with
cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal and vascular inflammatory
illnesses, infection and cancer.
Each department will have a new manager. Cardiovascular is headed by Dr Mike
Turnbull; Cancer by Dr David Julian; Vascular Inflammatory and
Musculoskeletal by Dr Barry Furr; and Infection by Dr Graham Boulnois. They
report to Dr David U'Prichard, research general manager.
Meanwhile, ICI has appointed Mr John Coleman, group environmental affairs
manager, as its group personnel manager. Dr Jim Whiston, presently group
safety manager, moves to the new post of group safety, health and
environment manager. He currently chairs the UK's Chemical Industry
Association responsible care advisory group.

FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BET raises Pounds 39m from sale of three
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BET, the business services group, has sold Boulton &amp; Paul, the joinery
company that has been running at an operating loss of more than Pounds 1m a
month.
The management, backed by Schroder Ventures, is paying Pounds 14.5m for the
company, which has been severely hit by the deteriorating housing market
over the past three years.
Boulton &amp; Paul had become the most intractable problem for BET during its
programme of divesting assets unrelated to the company's core operations.
The offshoot was put up for sale in 1990, at the same time that BET offered
Anglian, the double glazing company, for sale.
Anglian was almost bought by management and has since returned to the market
with a capital value of about Pounds 250m.
However, in the 12 months to March this year, Boulton &amp; Paul's sales have
shrunk to an estimated Pounds 70m, from Pounds 90.6m in the previous year,
when losses were Pounds 9.5m after reorganisation costs.
BET also announced yesterday the sale to management of Leada Acrow, the
plant services company, for Pounds 8.5m and Initial Ireland, the textile
services company, to Spring Grove Service for Pounds 3.5m.
The group also realised Pounds 12.3m of capital employed in the businesses
before they were sold.
In total BET raised Pounds 39m in cash from the sales, but it has suffered a
Pounds 31m shortfall over the book value of the assets. This is covered by
the existing Pounds 90m provision BET set up when it began the disposal
programme. Some Pounds 42m of this provision remains unused.
Mr John Clark, chief executive, said the sales would increase group
profitability and 'are an important step forward in the turnround of BET'.
The sale of Boulton &amp; Paul will help the profit and loss account but may not
be enough to save the final dividend.
At the interim stage, Mr Clark said it was the group's 'current intention'
to maintain the final 6.5p dividend. BET confirmed yesterday that remained
the group's position.
The sale of the loss-making UK companies will also help reduce the ACT
problem which emerged at the half way stage. BET had to write off ACT
because it was not making enough profit against which to offset it.
Initial Ireland had sales of Pounds 9.2m in the year to March. BET said it
has now completed its sales in the textile services area.
Leada Acrow had sales of Pounds 11.3m.

FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Shaw rebels win appointments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR DUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBEL shareholders won the day at yesterday's EGM of Arthur Shaw, the
loss-making West Midlands building materials group.
They ousted chairman Mr Gordon Pearson and appointed Mr Ian Tickler and Mr
Donald Crammond to the board.
Dissident shareholders, led by Mr Tickler, had expressed concern over the
management and recent performance of the company, and feared that the
business was losing direction. They claimed that high gearing and
deteriorating performance were mainly attributable to the costs of acquiring
the Jackdaw engineering tools group in 1990.
Mr Tickler and his family argued that Jackdaw should be sold to reduce debt
of about Pounds 3.35m and that the group should refocus on its core window
hardware side.
The dissident shareholders requisitioned the EGM to propose Mr Pearson's
removal from the board and the reappointment of Mr Tickler. They also called
for the reappointment of Mr Crammond, who was ousted at the AGM last August.
Following the meeting, Mr Tickler said that he and Mr Crammond were
delighted that shareholders had demonstrated support for their future
strategy of Arthur Shaw.
He said the new board intended to appoint an additional director as
non-executive chairman to oversee the implementation of this strategy.
A suitable candidate with appropriate experience and expertise had been
identified and Mr Tickler anticipated that a further announcement would be
made shortly.

FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: National Bank NZ improves by 24%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL BANK of New Zealand, part of Lloyds Bank, lifted after tax profits
by 24 per cent to NZDollars 102m (Pounds 36.1m) for 1992, largely due to the
purchase of the Rural Bank from Fletcher Challenge.
National Bank bought the Rural Bank, the country's biggest lender to the
farming sector, for NZDollars 450m in December, under a deal which included
the Rural Bank's post tax profits of NZDollars 24m for the six months from
July 1.
The Rural Bank has 40 per cent of the rural finance market.
National Bank's profit would have been down slightly by NZDollars 2m without
the inclusion of the Rural Bank's profit.
Nevertheless, the overall result meant National Bank's return on average
shareholders' funds was up from 14.3 per cent in 1991 to 16.5 per cent.
Mr John Anderson, chief executive, said that the bank continued to
outperform its competitors. Profit before tax was up Dollars NZ33m to
NZDollars 153m. This compared with a first half profit of NZDollars 90m,
which did not include any earnings from the Rural Bank.
Sir Spencer Russell, National Bank chairman and a former chief executive and
subsequently Governor of the Reserve Bank, said the result was creditable in
the face of a marked increase in competition in the finance sector in the
year.
National Bank's other operating earnings amounted to NZDollars 206m,
virtually unchanged from 1991. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts were
NZDollars 36m, down NZDollars 2m. Staff expenses rose by NZDollars 12m to
NZDollars 165m. Total operating costs were NZDollars 354m (NZDollars 316m).
The National Bank and the ASB Bank, which is partly owned by the
Commonwealth Bank of Australia, have been the only two banks in New Zealand
to have held their lending rates following the general upward lift after the
Reserve Bank tightened monetary policy in early January.

LINCOLN House, the USM-traded home furnishing group, returned to the black
in 1992 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 193,000 compared with the previous
year's loss of Pounds 286,000 and a deficit of Pounds 2.35m in 1990.
Operating profits amounted to Pounds 424,000 on sales of Pounds 7.3m;
against losses of Pounds 40,000 on sales of Pounds 7.7m last time.
Operating profits for discontinued businesses totalled Pounds 63,000 (Pounds
86,000) while losses of Pounds 55,000 were attributed to head office.
Mr Ian Topping, chief executive, said the sale of Impala Displays and Mayers
and Shaw to their managements reduced borrowings by some Pounds 800,000.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 239,000 (Pounds 332,000).
Earnings per share emerged at 1.2p against losses of 1.8p.

FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Anglian paying Pounds 36m for Nordic Water
 -Swedish diversification move will strengthen process engineering division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIAN WATER, one of the slowest of the privatised water companies to
expand into unregulated areas, is strengthening its process engineering
division with the purchase of the Swedish-based Nordic Water.
Anglian will pay SKR380m (Pounds 36m), including Pounds 8m of cash, for
Nordic, which is part of the real estate and construction group NCC.
Nordic will be combined with Anglian's existing, and smaller, process
engineering subsidiaries to create a division with annual sales of about
Pounds 110m.
Mr Alan Smith, Anglian's group managing director, said the acquisition
provided 'critical mass' and increased opportunities for international
business, such as BOT - build, operate and transfer - schemes.
He said Anglian had 'never been opposed to diversification, but we've been
very cautious about it and have refused to pay silly prices'.
Nearly all the 10 privatised companies have built up unregulated businesses,
usually in process engineering or waste management. The companies claim they
need to diversify before profits from water and sewage services starts to
slow, but some companies have been criticised for paying above market
prices.
Nordic produced estimated pre-tax profits of Pounds 4m last year on sales of
Pounds 83m. It had net assets of Pounds 7m, orders in hand of Pounds 67m and
about 400 employees.
Mr Goran Wijkmark, president, said the company was particularly strong in
Scandinavia and the UK, where its customers include North West Water and
Yorkshire Water. He said new ventures in eastern Germany and southern Poland
were also promising.
Last year more than 75 per cent of revenues came from contracting, where the
company operates under the name Purac. The remainder derived from products
like DynaSand filters which were developed by Nordic but are often
manufactured by sub-contractors. In all, the company operates in 10
countries, mainly in Europe.
Anglian's other process engineering subsidiaries include Rosewater
Engineering, acquired last July. These will be merged with Nordic and
managed by Mr Wijkmark from Sweden.
The division's future growth was expected to be mainly organic, although Mr
Smith said some further small acquisitions were possible.
A UK-based analyst said the acquisition gave Anglian's process engineering
business 'more credibility', but the division is still small compared to
those owned by Thames or North West Water.
Ofwat, the water regulator, was informed of the deal in advance.
North West Water has bought Consolidated Electric of the US for an
undisclosed price. Consolidated, which designs and makes controls and
instruments for the water industry, had total sales last year of Dollars
5.2m (Pounds 3.66m) and net assets of Dollars 2.5m.

Drayton Asia Trust, an Asian investment trust managed by Invesco MIM,
yesterday recommended shareholders to take no action in respect of the
offers from EFM Dragon Trust, because they undervalue the company.
EFM Dragon, a similar trust managed by Edinburgh Fund Managers, has made a

The terms involve EFM Dragon offering to issue ordinary shares at fully
diluted net asset value in exchange for Drayton Asia's ordinary shares at a
rate equivalent to EFM Dragon's asset value.
The offer includes the issue of three 2005 warrants for each Drayton

FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Sharp fall in Eagle Star life business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAGLE STAR, the insurance subsidiary of BAT Industries, yesterday announced
substantially reduced new life business figures for 1992. Worldwide new
regular premiums fell 6 per cent to Pounds 110m, while new single premiums
dropped 18 per cent to Pounds 436m.
The company attributed the bulk of this fall to a deliberate strategic
decision to cut less profitable lines of business where competition is on
price. These included UK annuity business, which fell by 18 per cent to
Pounds 372.6m. Group annuities dropped to Pounds 53m (Pounds 200m).
On the regular premium side, the company offered less competitive rates for
group life business, where new premiums fell from Pounds 12.4m to Pounds
3.6m.
Mr Ian Owen, managing director of Eagle Star Life, said: 'It would be easy
to increase business in those areas with higher rates but we don't believe
we can do that profitably. We would not want to announce increased business
figures in annuities or term assurance at present.'
The depressed housing market hit demand for mortgage-related endowment
policies, where premiums fell from Pounds 28m to Pounds 25m.
The company has instead concentrated on individual investment products. New
regular premium pensions rose by 13 per cent while single premium pensions
rose from Pounds 36.5m to Pounds 67m. Single-premium bonds, boosted by its
with-profits bond, rose from Pounds 53m to Pounds 140m, while unit trust
sales rose from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 26m.
Group funds under management increased by 11 per cent from Pounds 10.9bn to
Pounds 12.1bn.

FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: It's a dog's life as every cat has its day
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Every one knows that cats have nine lives, but evidence has also emerged
that they are recession proof - unlike dogs.
In the two years to September 1992, the UK cat population rose from about
6.7m to more than 7m. Dog numbers, on the other hand, declined by 1 per cent
last year, although they did keep their noses slightly in front of their
feline rivals.
These fascinating statistics formed part of Dalgety's results presentation
to the City yesterday. It seems that because cats cost less to keep than
dogs, there may have been some trading down by hard-pressed animal lovers.
This has proved good news for Arthur's (ne Kattomeat) and Purrfect, but not
so good for Prime and GoodLife - although Dalgety claimed an increasing
market share.
Demand for canned dogfood had fallen by 5 per cent last year and demand for
dog biscuits was affected by the growing popularity of complete dogfoods.
Spillers bit back in September with the launch of Choice Complete.

FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Scapa pays Pounds 11m for German group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCAPA GROUP, the Blackburn-based company which supplies industrial textiles
and services to the paper industry, has paid Pounds 11m cash for the
Oberdorfer Group, a German maker of forming fabrics.
Oberdorfer, which was in receivership, has manufacturing plants at Heidenhem
in Germany, Frankenmarkt in Austria and Idaho in the US. The loss-making
Idaho plant will be closed, with the loss of about 30 jobs, and production
will be transferred to Scapa's existing forming fabric plant in Shreveport,
Louisiana.
The number of jobs at Heidenhem has already been cut from 190 to 120 and in
Austria from 80 to 58.
Oberdorfer's annual turnover is Pounds 16m and Scapa said it was confident
that the group's continuing operations would be profitable.
Mr Harry Tuley, Scapa's chief executive, said: 'This acquisition fits our
strategy of building market share in our core business areas. Oberdorfer
will considerably strengthen Scapa's position in the supply of specialist
forming fabrics, used in the manufacture of paper, especially in the
important west European markets.'
Oberdorfer will be integrated into Scapa's engineering fabrics division,
which has manufacturing plants in 11 countries around the world.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Dalgety profits rise 4.5% to Pounds 56.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH in snacks for humans and feed for animals lay behind a 4.5 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 53.8m to Pounds 56.2m, at Dalgety, the
food and agriculture group, in the six months to December.
Trading profit advanced 7 per cent to Pounds 61.5m on turnover of Pounds
2.11bn, compared with Pounds 1.95bn. Progress in consumer foods and the
agribusiness was partly offset by a decline in food ingredients.
Mr Maurice Warren, chairman, said: 'Extra-special results came out of the
agriculture side.'
That division's trading profit advanced 23 per cent to Pounds 14.6m, on
turnover of Pounds 517m. Sales volumes for cattle and sheep feed rose 6 per
cent and raw material price rises, following the pound's devaluation, had
been passed on to customers.
Mr Richard Clothier, chief executive designate, said The Pig Improvement
Company, which has more than doubled sales in four years, had done
particularly well in the US. Attitudes had changed from 'pigs are pigs' to
an appreciation of the value of a good carcass.
Trading profits in consumer foods grew 11 per cent to Pounds 30.8m on sales
of Pounds 297m, including a full six months from Sooner Snacks, which was
bought a year ago for about Pounds 44m.
Golden Wonder is a leader in pot foods, where the market had grown by 9 per
cent. Mr Warren said part of the success was due to two new products: Fun
Pots for children and Pot Light.
The snacks market was flat, but some Sooner products such as Wotsits were
showing growth. The relaunch of Golden Wonder crisps in October had lifted
its market share.
Difficulties in the bread market and the temporary closure of a factory cut
into the food ingredients division's trading profits, which fell 16 per cent
to Pounds 9.1m on reduced sales of Pounds 139m.
Federal Bakeries had been sold to Ranks Hovis McDougall. Further
rationalisation of the milling and baking industries was awaited following
Tomkins' acquisition of RHM.
Net debt rose from Pounds 79m in December 1991 to Pounds 109m. Two-thirds
was accounted for by the pound's fall against the dollar.
The interim dividend was raised 5 per cent to 7.85p, twice covered by
earnings per share of 18.5p, up from 18p.

FT  16 FEB 93 / MB-Caradon seeks new challenge: CarnaudMetalbox stake may
raise Pounds 500m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since the Carnaud-Metalbox merger, there has been speculation that
MB-Caradon would not be a long-term holder of its 25.3 per cent
shareholding. At last there is a formal decision by the UK group to sell the
stake, which has provided a large chunk of profits but much less in cash
dividends.
The decision by MB-Caradon to seek shareholders' authority for a sale marks
the rehabilitation of the packaging group rather than discontent with the
merger. CarnaudMetalbox's share price, in sterling terms, has never been
higher.
But for a couple of years after the merger, MB-Caradon looked to be stuck
with the holding. The merger seemed doomed by a clash of cultures at the top
and the share price dived.
MB-Caradon and CGIP, the French holding company with an equal stake in
CarnaudMetalbox, together claim the credit for introducing new management to
the packaging group. Mr Jurgen Hintz, an American, became chief executive in
autumn 1991 and appears to have cut through Anglo-French difficulties and
galvanised the group. Profits have improved and the share price has
recovered.
Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive of MB-Caradon, says: 'We have always said
there would be a moment when it was worth our while to sell. It is not a bad
moment to consider it.'
MB-Caradon's patience has been rewarded and a sale at the current market
value - of Pounds 549m at last night's closing price - will give it a good
profit on last year's book value of Pounds 344.4m.
Now speculation will turn to two new questions. Who will buy the stake, and
what will MB-Caradon spend the money on?
Mr Jansen says: 'We have given a clear indication we want to sell. But there
is always the possibility that no-one will buy.' However, he does not seem
seriously worried that there will be a lack of buyers. Analysts think that
the decision to hold an extraordinary meeting on March 4, rather than
waiting for the annual meeting in May, suggests MB-Caradon already has a
purchaser in mind.
There are restrictions on the sale, though. Under an agreement between
MB-Caradon and CGIP, CGIP must be given the chance to match a third party
bid. Without an identified third party, MB-Caradon can offer the stake to
CGIP at the average share price over the preceding 60 trading days. CGIP can
then buy all or part of the stake.
It is hard to see why another company would want to get into MB-Caradon's
position - receiving a small cash return on a large investment - without the
agreement with CGIP which has effectively given the two shareholders control
of CarnaudMetalbox. A buyer could, perhaps, hope that CGIP will eventually
want to sell its stake, opening the way for a full bid.
For its part, CGIP does not seem to have the cash to acquire the whole of
MB-Caradon's stake. Other companies friendly to CGIP might be interested. Or
there is the possibility that CGIP could buy part of the stake and the rest
could be placed.
Mr Jansen feels that a placing would not give MB-Caradon the best price,
though it might be welcome to CarnaudMetalbox, especially if UK
institutions, which sold after the merger, reinvested.
MB-Caradon's balance sheet is already strong, with net debt of Pounds 69.1m.
If it raises Pounds 500m from the sale, and gears up as well, it could make
a sizeable acquisition or a number of smaller ones.
Mr Jansen says the group wants to 'find a replacement for CarnaudMetalbox's
profits stream, that we could do better with because we could manage it'.
That replacement must be 'something within our focus.'
In the longer term that means building products - Mr Jansen admits that in
time security printing could be overwhelmed within the group - probably in
the UK and Europe. Mr Jansen says he is 'more comfortable to buy in an
upturn' and believes the UK economy will recover sooner than economies in
continental Europe which he says will be less buoyant in 1993. He believes
there are plenty of opportunities for acquisitions and prices have not yet
moved out of reach.
MB-Caradon's products - which include Everest double glazing, Twyfords
bathroom fittings and Mira showers - are mainly branded goods aimed at the
housing repair and maintenance market.
These are the sort of businesses the group will look at, Mr Jansen says. But
judging by the stock market reaction yesterday, many companies in the sector
are seen as targets. Far from dying down, speculation about MB-Caradon's
plans will flourish until the stake is sold and the money reinvested.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Tapie sells control of Adidas for DM615m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bernard Tapie, the French businessman and politician, has sold control of
Adidas, the German sporting goods group, for DM615m (Pounds 260m) to a
consortium of investors including Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, the UK-based advertising group, and a number of French financial
institutions.
The French conservative opposition has called for an official inquiry into
the deal, which involves Mr Tapie, recently reappointed as Socialist
minister for towns, selling shares to a consortium including three
state-controlled companies - Credit Lyonnais, Assurances Generales de France
(AGF) and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP).
The Adidas controversy comes shortly after the outcry over the sale of Yves
Saint-Laurent, the fashion house chaired by Mr Pierre Berge, a close friend
of President Francois Mitterrand, to Elf-Sanofi, a subsidiary of Elf
Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group.
Mr Tapie, who needs to raise capital to reduce his debts, has for months
been trying to find a buyer for his Adidas shares following the collapse of
an earlier deal with Pentland, the UK consumer products company.
Adidas has had a tough time in the three years since Mr Tapie took control.
To meet fierce competition from Nike and Reebok of the US, Mr Tapie has
rationalised operations in the face of fierce union opposition, but Adidas
still saw net profits fall from DM52m in 1990 to DM15m on static sales of
DM3.35bn in 1991.
Under the terms of yesterday's deal Mr Louis-Dreyfus will leave Saatchi to
take over as chairman in April, with a 15 per cent stake in the Adidas
holding company. Credit Lyonnais will raise its holding from 10 per cent to
18 per cent, as will AGF from 5 per cent to 17 per cent and UAP from 5 per
cent to 7 per cent. Coatbridge and Omega Ventures, two investment funds,
will take 15 per cent and 19.9 per cent respectively.
Bull, the French computer group, saw sales fall 9.7 per cent from FFr33.45bn
in 1991 to FFr30.18bn (Pounds 3.78bn) last year. However, the group improved
its operating margins during the year. Bull's operating losses, which will
be announced when its results come out in early March, are estimated to have
fallen from last year's FFr1.5bn to below FFr1bn.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Mrs Fields quits London USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Fields is quitting the London stock market, leaving UK investors in the
controversial USM-quoted cookie company holding heavily diluted stakes in a
private group. Seven years after its debut on the unlisted securities
market, the US-based company said it had no viable alternative to a
refinancing.
The group's four US bankers have agreed to swap Dollars 96m (Pounds 68m) of
debt and preference shares for Dollars 50m in loan notes and a stake of 79.1
per cent.
Public shareholders will be diluted from 19.3 per cent to about 2.4 per cent
following the swap and a one-for-eight consolidation of existing shares. As
a result, Mrs Fields will not meet the regulatory requirements for a USM
listing.
However, a spokesman for the company said investors should 'regard this as a
positive outcome given the circumstances. The reality could have been some
form of administrative receivership.'
The banks intended eventually to sell the business, offering the prospect of
a return at some stage in the future, he said.
The founder and person most publicly associated with the company, Mrs Debbi
Fields, will remain as chairman. However, her stake falls from 18 per cent
to 8.4 per cent. The banks intend to appoint a new board and management
team.
The refinancing was accompanied by a profits statement, the first since
interims in October 1991. In 1992, the group reported a loss before tax and
exceptionals of Dollars 3.6m. Pre-tax losses for the year to December 31,
1991, were Dollars 3.4m, although exceptionals pushed the net loss to
Dollars 87.2m. The company said the exceptional charges related to its shift
towards franchising.
The company said the restructuring was likely to be approved at the
extraordinary general meeting on March 3. Some 80 per cent of the shares had
already been pledged to the banks in previous refinancing efforts.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MB-CARADON, the building products and security printing group, is to ask
shareholders for authority to sell its 25.3 per cent stake in
CarnaudMetalbox, the Franco-British packaging group.
The stake, worth Pounds 549m at last night's closing share price of Pounds
26.75p, up 62p, dates back to the April 1989 merger between Metalbox
Packaging, then a subsidiary, and Carnaud, the French group. MB-Caradon's
shares initially rose on the news but fell back to close unchanged at 310p.
Shareholders' approval is required because of the size of the stake and an
extraordinary meeting is being called for March 4. Mr Peter Jansen, chief
executive of MB-Caradon, said obtaining approval in advance would improve
the company's negotiating position. No minimum price was mentioned.
CGIP, the French industrial holding company which also holds a 25.3 per cent
of CarnaudMetalbox, said yesterday that it might increase its stake if the
French stock market authorities allow it to do so without making a full bid.
Paris analysts were doubtful that CGIP could afford to buy the whole of the
stake. 'CGIP would have to go into debt to buy the MB-Caradon stake in CMB,
or even a large part of it,' said Ms Christiane Marcellier, an analyst with
James Capel. 'The financial return on the investment just would not justify
doing that.'
MB-Caradon said that though the CarnaudMetalbox stake accounted for a
significant part of its assets and earnings, the dividends received were
modest, and were not a tax efficient source of income. It plans to reinvest
the proceeds of a sale in 'businesses under its direct control and
management'.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Japanese banks may write off bad loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Japan is urging Japanese banks to write off non-performing
loans, worth possibly several thousand billion yen, in a radical shift of
policy towards the banking system's bad loan problem.
A senior Bank of Japan official said that if the banks followed its advice
some banks might be forced into net losses for the year ending March 1993. A
Japanese bank has not made a loss since the second world war.
The move confirms that the financial authorities believe the Japanese
financial system is under more strain than at any time since the 1920s and
1930s when several banks collapsed.
It is unheard of for a Japanese bank to declare a loss mainly because they
have been able to cover their bad loans by drawing on accumulated reserves.
However the banks' bad loans have now reached such proportions that the Bank
of Japan is urging more radical action.
In the six months to the end of September the non-performing loans of the
top 21 Japanese banks rose 54 per cent to Y12,300bn (Pounds 72bn), largely
as a result of the collapse of the property market since 1989. The banks are
preparing for the close of their books for the year to the end of March 31.
The Bank of Japan official, commenting on Sumitomo Bank's recent decision to
write off Y100bn of bad loans, said: 'The Sumitomo decision is very much in
the right direction. We want to encourage banks to try to follow suit.'
He said some of the most vulnerable banks were opposed to writing off bad
loans because the resulting net loss could trigger a collapse in confidence.
'No bank is yet facing a net loss. But it is being discussed and I would say
it is even a possibility. We are telling them that if there is a need to go
that far then they should not be afraid to set off on the march because we
will stand behind them,' he said.
The banks have never before had to consider such drastic action because they
had never faced such massive bad loans, the official explained.
He said the recent cut in the official discount rate to 2.5 per cent was
partly aimed at encouraging banks to write off bad loans by allowing them to
improve their operating profits.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Sony and Matsushita discuss digital video recorder format
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE consumer electronics companies, led by Matsushita and Sony, are in
talks aimed at agreeing a common standard for the next generation of video
tape recorders, digital VTRs, which record films from televisions or
camcorders in computer language.
Unlike the current generation of analogue VTRs, in which picture quality
falls off sharply when copies are made, digital VTRs offer the prospect of
virtually perfect pictures no matter how many copies are made.
The discussions, which involve two of the fiercest rivals in the consumer
electronics industry, represents a concerted effort by Japanese
manufacturers to prevent a damaging standards war in an area which they
believe will be important in stimulating consumer demand for new electronics
products.
The talks are a strong indication that with consumer demand for new
electronics products at a low point - and after both Sony and Matsushita
have made expensive purchases of Hollywood studios - the industry recognises
it can no longer afford to fight costly format wars which only confuse
consumers and could be financially crippling for the loser.
'We would like to pursue the establishment of a single format in order to
gain the support of a wide range of foreign and domestic manufacturers and
thereby facilitate the digital VTR's diffusion among consumers,' Matsushita
said.
Matsushita and Sony are currently competing with different formats for
digital portable music. Matsushita has backed a digital tape format called
DCC, which it co-developed with Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics
group, while Sony has launched MiniDisc, which is like a miniature CD.
The two rivals are also locked in competition over the camcorder market, for
which they have backed two incompatible formats. Sony has an 8mm format
while Matsushita manufactures camcorders in the VHS-C format.
The rivalry between Matsushita and Sony reached a peak in the 1980s when the
two fought over the market for video tape recorders with different formats.
The defeat, on the consumer market, of Sony's Beta format, was a big blow,
not only financially, but perhaps more significantly to the company's
reputation.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Recovery hopes given boost by CBI survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES OF a revival in UK consumer demand have been given a boost by the
latest distributive trades survey from the Confederation of British
Industry.
The survey, released early today, found that Britain's retail, wholesale and
motor trades increased volume sales in January compared with a year ago at a
faster rate than expected. According to the CBI, the distributive trades
increased their sales slightly last month compared with December.
If the CBI's findings are backed by signs of recovery in December's
industrial production figures, due out today, and by tomorrow's official
January retail sales figures, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will be able
to frame his Budget on March 16 with greater confidence that the UK economy
is moving out of recession.
The CBI survey, which polled companies with 15,000 outlets in retailing,
wholesaling and the motor trades, found that retailers in January
experienced their strongest increase in sales on an annual basis since May
last year.
Wholesalers reported higher sales compared with a year ago after three
consecutive months of decline, while motor traders reported their strongest
year-on-year increase in sales for four years.
Motor traders and wholesalers said they expected a further strong increase
in sales this month, with motor traders reporting on balance that their
stocks are less than adequate to meet expected demand.
However, Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades
panel, warned that it was too early to be sure that the recovery in consumer
spending is sustainable.
'Despite the overall improvement in retail sales, the picture is still very
mixed across different sectors,' he said.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Yeltsin retreats to dacha for surprise holiday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, suddenly decided yesterday to take
a 12-day break from official duties and cancelled all engagements with
foreign visitors.
However, talks scheduled with Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker of the
Supreme Soviet, on the contentious issue of a referendum in April 11 on a
new constitution, may go ahead.
Mr Yeltsin's decision to seclude himself in his official dacha caught
Moscow's political establishment by surprise and left a question mark over
his reasons. Ill health was ruled out, though he was admitted to be tired.
This is not the first time Mr Yeltsin has suddenly quit his Kremlin duties
but it will be one of the longest.
Shortly after Mr Yeltsin's statement, Mr Khasbulatov appeared to concede his
opposition to a referendum, one of the main points of contention between the
two men which they failed to resolve during discussions last Thursday.
Though both Mr Yeltsin's and Mr Khasbulatov's intentions were shrouded in
their habitual ambiguity, what does seem clear is that the deepening power
struggle has not been alleviated.
Mr Khasbulatov has been opposed to the referendum and may be hoping to sink
it under the weight of additional questions.
He told a session of the praesidium of the parliament that he 'supported the
idea of the president' to prepare a second ballot paper with a range of
questions on whether the Russian citizens trusted the president, the
permanent Supreme Soviet, the full Congress of People's Deputies and the
Russian government.
Mr Yeltsin had originally said the referendum should be about trust when he
proposed the idea last December.
Mr Khasbulatov also said that elections should be held in spring for 'all
the highest bodies of power' - presumably including the parliament and the
president.
He said that the inclusion of the further questions would 'ensure the
attendance of citizens at the referendum' and show 'the sincerity of our
intentions'.
Although government ministers have consistently backed the idea of a
referendum to bring clarity into a situation where most important
legislation is bounced to and fro between government, presidency and
parliament between increasingly hostile sessions of the Congress of People's
Deputies, there is still no clear idea of how the referendum would be
phrased.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister who has been put in
charge of the referendum campaign, said yesterday that the president had not
decided which questions should be asked. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign
minister, said a referendum should be held on a constitution only after a
constituent assembly had prepared a draft referendum.

FT  16 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Courage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's interim results from Fosters Brewing reveal what a miserable
time its Courage subsidiary has been having. The trend is not as bad as
suggested by the 11 per cent decline in operating profits expressed in
Australian dollars. But even after adjustment for a pension fund
contribution in 1992, sterling profits still dropped Pounds 5m to Pounds 61m
in the six months to December compared with the same period of 1991. Volume
fell around 5 per cent. Gross margins were under strong pressure,
particularly in the on-trade, though this was offset to some degree by lower
central costs.
Courage faces a bitter struggle to secure its share of the on-trade by 1998
after which it will have no tied pubs left. So far it claims a high rate of
business retention in the 1,900 pubs freed from the tie in November. But
lower interest rates have reduced the attraction of free trade loans as an
incentive. Discounting is likely to remain its main weapon, which is not
good news for the competition. Though the evidence from elsewhere in the
industry is patchy, Courage also points to margin pressure in the off-trade.
Cost-savings generated by the acquisition of Grand Metropolitan's brewing
interests may thus be insufficient. Consumers have not yet felt much benefit
from government attempts to introduce greater competition in the industry,
but the extent of brewing overcapacity is becoming increasingly apparent.
Last year Courage disposed of Ruddles and its Trowbridge brewery, but it has
not yet resorted to closures. At least after last November's ADollars 1bn
rights issue, its parent is in a better position to meet the cost of any
surgery that proves necessary.

FT  16 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Dalgety
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Recession may have taken a bite out of the dog population, but Dalgety seems
to have survived intact. The company's solid performance owes more to its
agricultural business, though, than to the more fashionable snacks and pet
food markets. Indeed the strength of the agricultural supplies operation is
underlined by the apparently effortless way in which prices have been
increased by 20 per cent in the last six months.
Under Maurice Warren the company has rationalised its businesses,
strengthened its balance sheet and lived up to the food manufacturing
sector's defensive image. Still, this has all been reflected in the
company's share price. Doubts about future growth go beyond the market's
current obsession with cyclical shares.
Most promising areas for expansion in Europe are snacks and pet foods, but
both are dominated by larger players. With many continentals still feeding
Fido scraps, increasing the size of the pet food market may offer the best
opportunities. Dalgety, however, would require a deal with the likes of
Quaker to mount an effective challenge to Pedigree Petfoods.
The company's weak strategic position in such markets leaves it open to
attack. Dalgety is also less able to absorb the dilutive impact of
highly-priced acquisitions than its larger competitors. The European food
manufacturing industry demands deeper pockets than Dalgety currently has.

FT  16 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: MB-Caradon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The secret of a good investment - as well as a good joke - is timing. It is
still uncertain whether MB-Caradon has mastered the art to perfection or
fluffed the punch line as it prepares to sell its 25.3 per cent stake in
CarnaudMetalbox and reinvest the proceeds. From one perspective, the timing
is ideal. Under its new management, CarnaudMetalbox has finally begun to
fulfil the merger's original promise. The sterling share price - boosted by
the pound's devaluation  - stands at an all-time high. But it would be
dangerous for MB-Caradon to hold on too long. CarnaudMetalbox's main markets
in mainland Europe are softening. The value of its investment could fall
heavily if the franc were devalued.
If MB-Caradon can conclude a sale quickly, it will certainly show a tidy
gain. Its shareholding has a book value of Pounds 344.4m compared with a
market value of Pounds 549m, although shares not taken up by CGIP may have
to be placed at a discount in the market. In the short term, at least, a
sale is likely to dilute earnings slightly. Longer term, MB-Caradon should
obtain a better cash return than the Pounds 7.3m dividend income it received
last year. MB-Caradon seems inclined to sink the money into the UK building
materials sector. It may have missed its main chance. In the past three
months, the sector's shares have climbed 21 per cent in response to lower
interest rates. They are likely to climb still higher if a cash-rich
MB-Caradon lumbers into view.

FT  16 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Retiring assets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
By proposing to take a portion of British Rail and British Coal pension fund
assets into the national coffers ahead of privatisation, the government
risks looking greedy. It is right that existing pension arrangements cannot
simply be transferred to the private sector. Allocating BR's existing
200,000 pensioners to the proposed rail franchise operators would be neither
simple nor fair. But it may also be creating an opportunity to use some
sleight of hand in dealing with the public sector borrowing requirement.
Both pension funds are expected to show a surplus at the next actuarial
valuation. Since the government would guarantee index-linked benefits under
its proposal - a better promise than available from the private sector - it
may be tempted to claim a portion of the surplus. Given the public subsidies
which supported BR over the years, it may have a case. But identifying the
extent of a pension fund surplus is not a cut-and-dried affair. At the
least, the government would do to wait until the Goode Committee has
clarified the question of ownership. Were it to act sooner the government
would be setting a bad example for other companies to follow.
Even without the surplus, the government might be tempted to go in for some
slick book-keeping. From the rail and coal schemes alone, perhaps Pounds
13bn in pension fund assets might fall under government control. Any asset
sales would count as funding towards the PSBR. That would allow some subtle
smoothing of the borrowing requirement. But it would transfer the bill to
future governments committed to pay index-linked benefits. That is not what
fiscal rectitude is all about.

FT  16 FEB 93 / HK market buoyed by reports on China talks: Beijing sends
conflicting signals over reforms

THE Hong Kong stock market gained sharply yesterday on reports suggesting
that China may soften its opposition to talks with Britain about proposals
by Mr Chris Patten, the governor, for wider democracy in the colony.
The reports, in Chinese newspapers published in Hong Kong, were the first
indication that China might drop its call for Mr Patten to withdraw the
proposals, published last October, as a precondition for talks.
In spite of the reports, which quoted mainland officials, Beijing later
denied that it had moderated its opposition to the plans. These cover
broadening the electoral franchise in 1995 elections.
Following the denials, early trading was hesitant on the Hong Kong stock
market today.
Separate to the latest reports, China has indicated that it is willing to
discuss Hong Kong's political development before Mr Patten's proposals are
put to the colony's Legislative Council.
The Executive Council, Mr Patten's top advisory body, two weeks ago cleared
a bill for submission to the Legislative Council which would give effect to
his plans for greater representative democracy in Hong Kong without
amendment.
But it was understood yesterday that Mr Patten had last week delayed
gazetting the bill after Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong
affairs, requested time to study it. The bill is still expected to be
introduced before the end of this month and Legco is likely to debate it at
length.
Mr Lu is understood to have indicated to Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's
ambassador in Beijing, an interest in discussing Hong Kong's political
development before the bill is published.
If talks do begin, Mr Patten and the British government will have to decide
whether and how long to defer the introduction into Legco of the governor's
plans, or attempt to negotiate with China while Legco debates them.
Officials said China had left it to the eleventh hour to suggest talks might
be possible. 'They will have to recognise that the process has moved a long
way since and that we cannot put everything on hold,' said one.
The Hang Seng index yesterday rose 191.29 points, or 3.27 per cent, to end
the day at 6,049.44 - the first time the market has closed above 6,000 since
November.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Personal View: Myths about ministerial trade missions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MCGREGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No businessman or woman invited to join a reasonably senior government
minister on a UK trade mission overseas is likely to refuse, especially if
it is the prime minister. Most business people believe that such a personal
acquaintance with a minister will always come in useful and that, at worst,
the minister will learn about their problems. They may not, though, have a
great belief in the real value of the visit.
It is very important that ministers are clear about the precise objectives
of such missions and how they will affect the decisions of the prospective
customers. The visits can provide ministers with the opportunity to find out
about the way in which particular industries and their customers operate,
provided ministers are not changed too often. Educating trade and industry
secretaries in this way over the past 13 years or so - a period of rapid
ministerial turnover - would have been a very unprofitable business.
A year or so ago I provided a guide for ministers and their officials on the
usefulness of overseas missions, which was given to the relevant
departments.
In countries with command economies much business is done on a
government-to-government basis. They are becoming fewer in number, but where
they exist a ministerial involvement is helpful. Because of the economic
state of most of them the deal usually requires some officially subsidised
credits.
In tightly controlled countries, such as the Arab oil states, there can be
dramatic results from a UK political intervention since most of the
decisions are made by one person or very few people. (A good example is the
Saudi aircraft contract Al Yamamah 2, in which the prime minister was
involved, although his predecessor had already been given credit for
securing it.)
In developing countries, which usually have some aspects of command
economies, there will be a need for assistance of one kind or another and
for credit guarantees. Ministers do not always understand that they will be
wasting their time if the aid and credit guarantees are not forthcoming,
since it is these aid and credit guarantees that are important, not the
minister's presence.
In countries where a new relationship with the UK has opened a previously
closed market, or where rapid political or economic change is taking place
(eg, most of the former Comecon countries and others such as Iran, Vietnam,
a post-Saddam Iraq when it happens), it may be necessary to make high-level
political contacts in order to understand in what direction and how fast the
country is moving before it is possible to assess business prospects. The
presence of a minister as mission leader can be absolutely essential in
gaining access to the country's senior politicians and also in demonstrating
a UK political commitment to developing trade. Tangible signs of commitment
will be required.
In pluralistic open market economies with fully convertible currencies and
individual centres of decision-making, there is almost no useful purpose to
be achieved by a ministerial visit (this applies to practically all OECD
countries). In many of these countries a company may be set up as a domestic
operation and the UK connection may be irrelevant or a potential hindrance.
We had to persuade one minister not to lead a mission to the US.
There are, of course, cases which do not fit neatly into one of these
categories and which need to be looked at individually. The question must be
what the minister is going to do, and how he will be able to influence the
placing of business with UK firms.
It should be remembered that with the growing internationalisation of
business there are countries where British companies will service the market
from a third country (eg South America or the Caribbean from the US).
Business people like to have active support from their government. But
flag-waving has a limited value, and the value of ministers as salesmen can
be over-rated. Ministers need to listen carefully to what business leaders
tell them about the markets and the political support which those
competitors may be receiving from their governments, with or without
missions.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Tokyo's quick fix
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE government is engaged in a substantial effort to support the
Tokyo stock market through widespread government intervention in the
financial sector. Its motives are understandable - the level of the stock
market is a central determinant of the health of the Japanese economy. But
this intervention looks increasingly misguided. The longer the authorities
prevent the market from finding its own level, the longer Japan's financial
institutions will have to wait before recovery arrives.
Japan's stockbrokers are suffering because they are still geared up for the
glory years of the late 1980s. Daily average trading volumes on the Tokyo
stock market have fallen from a peak of 1,021m shares in 1988 to less than
200m shares at the end of last year. New issues have dried up.
Buoyant share prices are not only in the interests of Tokyo's stockbrokers.
Japanese banks, in the face of mounting bad debts from property loans which
have turned sour, must pass the Bank of International Settlement's capital
adequacy ratios at the end of this March. But a large share of their
reserves is made up of unrealised gains on their equity portfolios.
The fortunes of other financial institutions are also closely tied to share
prices. Many smaller insurance companies have virtually no unrealised
capital gains left on their equities. They would be desperately short of
reserves to pay bonuses to policy holders if equities were to fall further.
Yet a fall in equities is now a real danger. The Nikkei index is drifting
listlessly around 17,000. Companies are eyeing the close of their financial
year at the end of March. With a fourth consecutive year of declining
profits looming for most of them, the sale of shareholdings has become a
common tool to boost profits. But a selling spree before March would
threaten the banks' chances of meeting the BIS standards.
Little wonder that the government has succumbed to the temptation to try to
place a floor under the Nikkei around the 16,000 level. By providing the
trust banks with the necessary funds from the public sector postal savings
system, the government has become just about the only domestic purchaser of
equities. The Ministry of Finance has also exploited its considerable
influence over the financial services industry by encouraging insurance
companies and other financial institutions not to sell shares before the end
of March. Banks are also being discouraged from selling equities.
Yet the government is buying time at the expense of savers and taxpayers
while casting doubt on the government's commitment to financial
liberalisation. None of the government's ruses can disguise the underlying
reason for the market's thin trading - that, with the Nikkei trading on
about 55 times earnings, the market still looks high.
There is a better alternative. The Tokyo stock market should be allowed to
fall to a level that bears some reasonable relationship to the level of
returns in the rest of the world. In order to prevent a fall in share prices
provoking a systemic financial collapse, the Bank of Japan should follow the
precedent of America's handling of its savings and loans crisis. It should
guarantee to provide direct financial assistance to the banks and insurance
companies, which will inevitably suffer as their unrealised equity gains
evaporate and the underlying balance sheet malaise is exposed.
Only then will investors return to the market, volumes pick up and brokers
start to make some money. The government's current attempt to prevent a
crisis at any significant financial institution risks distorting Japan's
financial markets for years to come. It makes little sense to use the money
of ordinary savers to defy financial gravity. The time for such manipulation
is past.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Leading Article: The Middle East prize
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a sad reflection on the Middle East peace process that 16 months after
it was launched the first task for Mr Warren Christopher, the new US
secretary of state, should be to prod the participants back to the
negotiating table.
His trip to the region later this week will be deemed a success if Israel,
the Palestinians, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon agree to resume talks, despite
Israel's refusal to implement fully UN Security Council resolution 799,
which demands the immediate return of the 400 men deported from the occupied
territories to southern Lebanon.
But it will have been achieved at political cost to all parties, especially
to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, who was forced to bow to US
pressure and offer to readmit 100 men in order to stave off the threat of UN
sanctions, and to the Palestinian delegation which is daily losing ground to
more radical factions in the occupied territories.
The room for manoeuvre by both sides has been reduced by Mr Rabin's
ill-considered response to increased violence in the West Bank and Gaza, and
it is going to take a bold negotiating initiative to restore optimism to the
peace process.
No one doubts Mr Rabin's credentials as a man committed to the security of
Israel. What is now required is greater evidence of his powers of
conciliation, through relaxing the often harsh regulations affecting the
lives of the 1.6m Palestinians, and by offering a greater degree of
self-rule during an agreed transition period leading to the final
determination of the status of the occupied territories.
Israel's government has already sensed the size of the prize on offer.
Syria, for so long its most unflinching enemy, looks ready to sign a peace
treaty if a deal can be struck over the Golan Heights. It is eager to get
back to the negotiations in Washington, but does not wish to be seen to be
abandoning the Palestinians. Lebanon's relations with Israel depend on the
outcome of the Syrian talks, while Jordan can only begin to resolve its
bilateral issues once there is progress between Israel and the Palestinians.
It has become increasingly apparent that the Israelis and their Arab
negotiating partners cannot achieve this on their own. All sides claim that
there will never be a better chance of making peace than with their present
interlocutor. Yet substantive issues have scarcely been touched since the
talks opened in October 1991. Supported by the lessons learned from previous
Egypt-Israeli negotiations, this must lead to the conclusion that without
more forceful US involvement the peace process stands little chance of
progress.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Trouble with the neighbours: Latin America fears a less
productive relationship with the new US administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Bill Clinton settles into the White House, Latin American governments are
worried that once again, US policy towards them is taking an unpredictable
turn. They often characterise American attitudes as a pendulum swinging from
crisis to neglect. Relations have been more consistent - generally bad.
One of George Bush's achievements as president was the improvement of
relations with most neighbouring governments. His decision to negotiate a
free trade area with Mexico and to open the prospect of free trade with the
rest of the region through the Enterprise for Americas Initiative was
applauded by Latin governments.
'For us, the Enterprise for Americas Initiative was the most important
initiative from the US in 30 years,' says Mr Alieto Guadagni, Argentina's
secretary for international economic relations.
In contrast, from the Latin American perspective, the Clinton administration
has started badly. Governments are worried by the protectionist signals
coming from Washington just as they are seeking to expand exports.
They were also disappointed by the choice of Mr Mario Baeza, a black
Cuban-American lawyer with little experience of the region, as nominee for
the job of assistant secretary for Latin American affairs in the State
Department. They became more concerned when Mr Baeza was dropped under
pressure from the Florida-based anti-Castro lobby on the grounds that he
might be too soft on President Fidel Castro. 'It looks as if the only Latin
Americans who matter to Clinton are the Miami Cubans,' says one academic.
If the pendulum is swinging towards neglect, as Latin American leaders fear,
there are dangers. Mr William Leogrande, politics professor at the American
University in Washington, says Latin America's problems should be addressed
now 'before they become such extraordinary crises that all the policy
options left are bad ones'.
Talk of crisis contrasts sharply with the enthusiasm that has suffused
Washington and Wall Street over the past two or three years about the
region's prospects.
The excitement was in part justified by the transformation of the political
and economic map of Latin America during the 1980s. Elected governments,
rather than military dictatorships, are now installed almost everywhere in
the region. These governments have opened their economies to foreign trade
and capital in the belief that the closed, state-controlled economies
favoured by their predecessors were largely to blame for the debt-induced
recession of the 1980s.
Economic reforms - aimed at revitalising the market through such measures as
privatisation and openness to foreign investment - yielded higher growth and
lower inflation in most countries.
But by last year expectations appeared to have run ahead of reality. Says Mr
Victor Bulmer-Thomas, head of the Institute for Latin American Studies at
the University of London: 'If we compare where Latin America is now with,
say, two years ago, it's actually in a very satisfactory position. If people
are now beginning to get depressed, it's because expectations were built up
far too high.'
Events of the past 12 months have also reasserted some of the region's
perennial problems: authoritarianism, corruption and political violence.
There have been two military coup attempts in Venezuela, the suspension of
the constitution in Peru, the impeachment of the president on corruption
charges in Brazil and the declaration of a state of emergency in Colombia,
where the government faces an intensifying struggle against left-wing
guerrillas and drugs traffickers.
On the economic front, too, some of the region's success stories have
started to look less secure. Mexico, for example, faces the growing problem
of financing a current account deficit of Dollars 20bn, equivalent to 6 per
cent of gross domestic product.
With the euphoria punctured, capital inflows into the region, look set to
decline. According to J P Morgan, the New York bank, the flow of private
capital into the region is expected to drop this year to Dollars 23bn from
an estimated Dollars 44bn last year.
These developments have uncovered tensions created by the simultaneous
attempt to transform political and economic systems. Mr Abraham Lowenthal,
director of the Centre for International Studies at the University of
Southern California in Los Angeles, says the region's shifts are important
but 'they are not yet deeply rooted'.
Reforms are often implemented by a few senior government officials, and
opposed by influential groups such as the military, the bureaucracy, trade
unions, political parties and local industrialists who thrived behind the
old tariff walls. Their positions are threatened by the decentralisation of
power that can result from both political reform - through a more effective
popular democracy - and from economic reform, which deprives the state of
influence, for example through privatisation.
Furthermore, the economic reforms are seen, sometimes justly, as
accentuating already-wide income disparities. Two out of five Latin
Americans live in poverty - 180m people compared with 130m in 1980. The
wealthiest fifth of the population earn 20 times that earned by the poorest
fifth, compared with less than 10 times in Asia.
Economic reform has not been unpopular everywhere. In Argentina, for
instance, the ending of hyperinflation and the opening of the economy has
bolstered the authority of President Carlos Menem. People have been given
access to cheaper consumer goods
and so far have responded by supporting the government.
But sooner or later, the piper has to be paid by increasing exports. 'The
model is one of export-led growth; the problem is that in most countries
exports have yet to take off,' says Mr Bulmer-Thomas.
The difficulties in increasing exports are compounded, however, where the
exchange rate is allowed to appreciate in real terms as part of the attempt
to fight inflation. This appreciation, a problem both for Mexico and
Argentina, makes imports progressively more competitive against
home-produced goods. It widens the current account deficit and hurts
domestic industry.
In Mexico, vanguard of the region's economic reform movement, some
economists think that only further aggressive deregulation will rid the
economy of its bottlenecks - its bad roads and ports, inefficient
bureaucracy and corrupt law enforcement - to allow it successfully to
compete on a international level.
Such reforms will take time, and time may be in short supply. Important
clues to the durability of economic reform will be given in the next two
years as an intense period of presidential election activity starts. This
year, presidential elections are scheduled in Paraguay in May, in Bolivia in
June, and in Venezuela and Chile in December.
The elections will highlight the tensions between democracy, economic reform
and the power of entrenched interests throughout the region. And while Mr
Clinton cannot determine the outcome of events in Latin America, he can be
an important influence.
His campaign speeches suggested more emphasis on promoting democracy, which
he argued should be the motivating force behind US foreign policy in the
post cold-war period. His approach to drugs trafficking - particularly if it
focuses on curbing demand in the US rather than on pouring more resources
into interdiction in producing countries - may prove more constructive than
that of Mr Bush.
But the most important question-mark is over trade, and the new
administration's attitudes to the Uruguay Round trade talks and to the North
American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, negotiated last year
and due before the legislatures of the three countries this year for
ratification. Mr Clinton has declared himself in favour of Nafta, though he
wants some side agreements with Mexico that would protect American jobs and
ensure Mexico does not suck in investment because of lower environmental
standards. However, the Democratic party is divided over the agreement and
Mr Clinton may be deterred from submitting it to Congress for quick
ratification.
'The rejection of Nafta at this stage would be a decisive setback. It would
deal a severe blow to Mexico's economic reform efforts and strain US-Mexico
relations. It would also gut the core of future hemisphere-wide trade
relations,' says the InterAmerican Dialogue, a Washington-based study group
in a report published last month.
Without Nafta, the most potent, tangible expression of closer, more
constructive US-Latin relations would be jeopardised. Securing the real
gains made over the past few years and preventing a resurgence of
authoritarianism and economic nationalism in Latin America would become more
difficult.

And now, a cautionary tale on the perils of covetousness. A man who dropped
his wallet down the lavatory of a French TGV train on Sunday plunged his
hand in after it and got stuck. Sounding the alarm, he succeeded in stopping
the train at a remote station where firemen cut him, and the lavatory, free.
He got his wallet back, but not before appearing on television lying on the
platform with a toilet wrapped around his arm.
Moral: if you must make a fool of yourself, sign up the television rights
first.

The ghost of Brillat-Savarin stalks the Eiffel tower. Just as the managers
of McDonald's in France were celebrating the news that theirs had become the
biggest restaurant chain in the country, they were hit with the less welcome
tidings that they cannot open a restaurant next to the famous landmark in
Paris.
Georges Sarre, the minister who issued the ban, was unusually undiplomatic.
He told McDonald's straight that it would 'not be allowed to open on such a
prestigious site'.

The latest clutch of ministerial parliamentary private secretaries, an
essential first step for young parliamentary stars, has thrown up some
interesting combinations. Tim Sainsbury, the rather smooth old Etonian
industry minister, for example, gets the bluff Eric Pickles, (ex-Leeds
Polytechnic and Bradford Council leader).
However, TV broadcaster Gyles Brandreth's appointment as Stephen Dorrell's
bag-carrier is more interesting. Brandreth is a good four years older than
his master but Dorrell is very much a rising star. Brandreth is determined
and hardworking, but may be handicapped by memories of his rather fluffy
TV-am past. Perhaps that's why he isn't defence minister Jonathan Aitken's
pps.
That job is already being done by Stephen Milligan, a contemporary of
Brandreth's at Oxford and another union president. On paper at least, he
would seem to be more in tune with Dorrell. Milligan was the last 'wet'
president of the OU Conservative association before the relentless tide of
right-wingers - which helps explain why it took him so long to find a
parliamentary seat.

Like several of its former Soviet neighbours, the tiny Central Asian
republic of Kyrgyzstan has had to grapple with nationalist tension and
ethnic rivalries. Having thwarted attempts to force ethnic Russians to learn
the Kyrgyz tongue it has now declared the country's accepted languages to be
Kyrgyz, Russian and English, in that order of course.
Prime Minister Tursunbek Chyngyshev, in London yesterday, insisted it was
not just to impress the English, though he had felt obliged to tag on German
as a fourth language during a recent trip to Bonn.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Observer: Polling error
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps the most ignominious part about George Vassiliou's defeat in
Cyprus's presidential elections is that his own Middle East Marketing
Research Bureau failed to predict the outcome.
Admittedly, it was a close-run affair, with Vassiliou - the incumbent and
favourite - beaten by just 1,988 votes. Even so, his polling team had
forecast that he would win by a margin of at least 4 percentage points. What
made it worse was that the bureau had produced the only accurate forecast
for the first-round ballot.
As Vassiliou has no political party of his own, he will probably return to
running his old company. However, there could be a happy ending. When he was
president, Glafcos Clerides was one of his main political advisers. Now that
Clerides has got Vassiliou's job, the roles might be reversed.

Meanwhile, news that the Bank of England's brand new inflation report will
be on sale at all 'good' bookshops from 5.30 tonight raises some interesting
possibilities. Presumably, someone at the Bank has done a little bit of
retail price maintenance research to make sure that if the Pounds 4 tome
does get transferred to the remaindered pile, its price is not quickly
devalued. What chance of Norman Lamont signing a few celebrity copies?

FT  16 FEB 93 / Observer: U-turn was noted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In one area, at least, we now know that the Bank of England takes orders
from no one. 'It was our decision. You can't blame the Treasury for this
one.' Thus an official from the Old Lady yesterday owning up to the redesign
of the Pounds 5, Pounds 10 and Pounds 20 notes.
The chancellor of the exchequer, in his capacity as master of the Royal
Mint, may look after our coinage, but in the design and issue of banknotes
the Bank is sovereign. Nor is it reversing a mistake, the same official
avers - the U-turn merely demonstrates its capacity to respond to the
public.
Whatever, the volte face is welcome news for De La Rue, the world's leading
private sector banknote maker. The company would love to see the Old Lady's
responsibility for note printing transferred to the private sector, and
claims some Treasury support for the idea.
Observer understands that it therefore proposes to make liberal use of the
Bank's setback in its campaign to broadcast the merits of private banknote
printing.
De La Rue says that its Gateshead printing works, where it produces
banknotes for the Scottish clearers, operates at twice the productivity of
the Bank's Essex printing works.
The Bank refutes the argument, but since it remains coy about its production
details, whom are we to believe?

FT  16 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Marketing gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNDERLYING message of the latest Bank of England survey of the gilt
market is the same as that implied by the news that the Bank may allow gilts
to be 'stripped'. It is that selling Pounds 50bn of gilts this year is going
to be hard work. So the Bank and the Treasury, like modern marketing
managers, are segmenting the market for UK government securities and
devising versions to appeal to each constituency.
Last year, overseas investors were wooed by making all the new stocks free
of tax for them. Impulse buyers were offered 2.30 am opportunities to buy
tap stocks, in the rallies that followed Mr Major's victory in the election
and defeat in the ERM. Now, institutional investors may be offered synthetic
zero-coupon gilts, if securities houses get approval to 'strip' the flow of
interest payments from gilts.
One potential difficulty - the settlement delays that accompanied the surge
in retail investors' demand late last year - has been turned into a
marketing advantage. The Bank leaned on gilt-edged market-makers to sort out
the problem - a contrast with the much more protracted equity settlement
problems at the time of Big Bang.
Other innovations doubtless lie ahead, among them perhaps a recognition that
when it comes to financing the deficit, the banks' money is a good as anyone
else's.
There are two ways, however, in which the Bank cannot afford to admit that
the customer is always right. The survey repeats the Bank's opposition to
regular, scheduled gilt auctions, presumably because of the inevitable
crises of confidence if the authorities are tied to a rigid timetable.
And the retail customer cannot be offered indefinitely the sure-fire capital
gain provided by anticipated interest rate cuts. As last year demonstrates,
this ensures eager demand. But, alas, with base rates already down, the
scope for further cuts is limited.
One figure in the Bank's report highlights the problems ahead. The degree to
which gilts offered at auctions were covered by demand last year ranged from
twice to 1 1/4 times, rather lower than in the year before. As that downward
trend illustrates, there is more to financing the deficit than a thorough
study of a marketing textbook.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Letter: Best protection against the risk of punitive damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GREGORY J THWAITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your analysis of the punitive damages threat to foreign businesses in
America raises the right issues, but does not necessarily give the best
answer ('The high cost of damaged goods', February 9). Arbitration (the
enforceable form of alternative dispute resolution) does not exclude the
possibility of punitive damages. The laws of the individual states normally
permit an arbitration to award punitive damages, as a court can.
In fact, an arbitration may increase the risk of punitive damages. First, an
arbitration panel (normally one or three members) is smaller than a jury
(normally 12 members), so the undisclosed prejudices or misconceptions of an
individual member have more adverse impact in an arbitration. Second, the
award of a jury can be reviewed by a court. This means that the defendant
has some pressure to negotiate down the award of punitive damages before the
appeal is heard, while the appeal court itself may overturn the entire jury
award and order a new trial if there is an error in the trial, or may reduce
the award of punitive damages. The award of an arbitration panel cannot
normally be reviewed by a court. Third, the more informal atmosphere of an
arbitration can be more favourable to an individual than a company, as the
company has less scope for attacking the individual's credibility in the
cosy environment of a small hearing room.
A good product, cautious marketing, demonstrable corporate integrity and
good legal advice at every step are some of the best techniques to protect
against punitive damages.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Letter: Procedures set out by social chapter will provide
flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE ROBERTSON MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The otherwise reliable Joe Rogaly was plain wrong when he described the
Maastricht social chapter ('The way out for Major', February 12).
The social protocol may say that the 11, excluding Britain, wish to continue
down the path laid down by the 1989 social charter, but the agreement which
is appended, and from which Britain is also excluded, is merely a procedure
which extends qualified majority voting to the area of 'working conditions'.
The one-nation veto goes but majorities still have to be laboriously
obtained.
The agreement contains no specific provisions. However, it also sets out new
procedures under which employers and employees can agree to make agreements
between themselves without legislation from the EC. This concept of 'social
framework agreements' was inserted into the chapter at the specific
insistence of European employers in order to get more flexibility in
European workplace legislation.
In spite of the constant claims that the social chapter would reverse what
change there was in industrial relations during the 1980s, the truth is that
the social chapter specifically excludes mention of pay, strikes or
lock-outs.
The increasingly frenetic debate about the social chapter has to be based on
facts, not propaganda, If it is it will be seen as a sensible, practical
complement to the single European market - and one which will make it fairer
and more effective.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Letter: Explanations on exchange rate needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J ELLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Would it not be timely for the chancellor and the governor of the Bank
of England to explain what they meant when they made the following
statements?
At the Mansion House (October 29 1992) the chancellor said the government
would not ignore sterling exchange rates in judging policy following
departure from the ERM.
At the Conservative party conference (October 8) Mr Lamont stated that the
exchange rate measured by its index against a basket of currencies would
remain a significant factor in making decisions on interest rates.
Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton stated on September 29 1992: 'If we are to achieve
our domestic counter-inflationary goals we cannot afford to ignore the
exchange rate.'
Taking the Pounds index as shown elsewhere in your paper, is the exchange
rate being ignored? The chancellor should explain - as should the other
authorities - that the Treasury will give reasons for interest rate changes
after they are made.

FT  16 FEB 93 / The law is an asset
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If he is not careful, Mr Douglas Hurd will be subjected to Lord Salisbury's
verdict on the late Mr Iain Macleod - that he is 'too clever by half'. Or,
as old-fashioned British nannies warned their charges: 'You are so sharp you
might cut yourself.' The foreign secretary must have known that this might
be the response to yesterday's statement on the bill to ratify the
Maastricht treaty. He was at his most persuasive, his dulcet tones
confirming that here was a delicate one.
His argument does take some swallowing. On January 20 Mr Tristan
Garel-Jones, the foreign office minister responsible for seeing the bill
through, said that if a certain Labour amendment - number 27 on the list -
was carried, 'United Kingdom law would not conform to the provisions of the
treaty, so we could not ratify it'. Yesterday his boss, Mr Hurd, said that
'amendment number 27 would . . . not have any effect on the treaty itself .
. .'
What has happened in the intervening weeks is that the government nearly
fell off its perch. Conservative opponents thought that by supporting the
amendment they could sink the treaty; Labour enthusiasts for the EC's social
programme thought that the amendment would oblige the government to
renegotiate the whole deal, and sign up to their beloved 'social chapter'.
The government's lawyers have now come to the rescue. They have done what
the best mouthpieces always do in such circumstances. They have thought
again. This is hardly surprising: they have a powerful client.
They were wrong on January 20, and right yesterday. For the celebrated
amendment simply excludes the protocol on social policy from the bill. That
protocol itself excuses Britain from participation in the social chapter,
which the other 11 members of the EC have agreed to implement. Either way,
there are no legally-binding rights or obligations that affect Britain, so
there need be no legislation on this point.
Deleting the protocol would not bring the social chapter into effect in
Britain. I cannot understand why the Labour party ever thought it would. It
might have wrecked the treaty. The Tory Eurosceptics cannot be blamed for
thinking that it could, since in earlier efforts to frighten pro-European
Labour MPs off their party's amendment both Mr Hurd and Mr Garel-Jones
rammed home that very argument. No longer. 'In summary,' said Mr Hurd
yesterday, 'the law officers consider that, while incorporation of the
protocol in domestic law is desirable, it is not necessary for ratification
or implementation of the Maastricht treaty.'
Being right this time may not be well received. Labour's amendment was
tabled in May 1992; the government should have thought of yesterday's
formulation long before now. Yet the penalty may be no more than a
prolongation of the irascible season in parliament. In the end Mr John Major
must ratify the Maastricht treaty, and he must do it straight. He may play
parliamentary games but he cannot make use of what would be seen as a dodgy
constitutional device.
These imperatives are self-evident. If the prime minister does not get his
treaty through he will have failed in every European endeavour he has
undertaken since, as chancellor, he floated the notion of the 'hard ecu'.
Far from placing Britain at the heart of Europe, he would have presided over
its collapse into the North Sea. With such a record the question of his
survival in office would become irrelevant. There would quite simply be no
point to him. Using the royal prerogative in what would be a questionable
attempt to side-step parliament might save the treaty, but only at the cost
of Mr Major's reputation for honesty and plain dealing. Payment of such a
price would leave him politically bankrupt.
Yesterday's statement by Mr Hurd need not have that effect. As the foreign
secretary said, the important test is the third reading, when the Commons,
if true to past form, will vote overwhelmingly in favour of the bill as it
then stands, with or without amendment number 27. The treaty can then be
ratified in the name of the Queen. There is nothing odd here. All
international agreements of such importance are signed in the names of the
heads of the participating states. Sitting at a table in Maastricht on
February 7 1992 the German foreign and finance ministers, then Mr
Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Mr Theodor Waigel, signed the 'Treaty on European
Union' on behalf of the president of the federal republic. Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's name does not appear; yet his government had to seek the assent of
both houses of parliament for what were rightly regarded as alterations in
Germany's basic law.
It was more complicated in France. Messrs Roland Dumas and Pierre Beregovoy
signed for President Francois Mitterrand. What followed next was peculiarly
French. The 'Conseil Constitutionel' ruled that the treaty required changes
in the French constitution. Parliament assented to those on May 25 1992. The
required majority in such cases is three-fifths of the votes of both houses
sitting together. On July 1 the president used his powers to seek
ratification of the treaty by means of referendum.
In the US the power to make treaties is vested in the president, acting with
the advice and consent of two-thirds of the Senate. Even that is not
unlimited; the Supreme Court has repeatedly asserted the supremacy of the US
constitution over any treaty. If a future president tries to develop the
North American Free Trade Agreement into some kind of political union with
Canada and Mexico it will be necessary to win the votes of two-thirds of
both houses of Congress, plus three-quarters of the states.
Mr Hurd's problem, and Mr Major's, is that in Britain there is no written
constitution to tell them what to do. Their bill provides, in three short
paragraphs, for the incorporation into British law of the deals done by the
government excepting those relating to co-operation in foreign and security
policy or justice and home affairs matters. This is logical. Where a law
needs changing to suit the treaty, as do the European Communities Act of
1972 and the European Parliamentary Elections Act of 1978, a parliamentary
vote is required. Where no change is needed, no new law is needed. The
foreign secretary should have been clever enough to have said all that in
the first place.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Slicker in the City: Warburg is re-evaluating its strategy
to compete globally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We will never go deeper into the gutter than anyone else, but by our lights
we will be relatively aggressive,' said the Earl Cairns, chief executive of
S G Warburg, the UK's most ambitious investment bank.
He was responding to a report that a US rival had not been playing fair  - a
Warburg director had complained that an American securities firm it was
working with had been 'pinching' Warburg's corporate finance ideas and
passing them off to a client as its own.
Lord Cairns' remark sums up a dilemma faced by Warburg in deciding its next
moves in a long-running strategy to become a genuinely international
investment bank. At the moment, the most successful international houses, on
many measures, are American - such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and
First Boston (with its London affiliate, Credit Suisse First Boston).
The challenge for Warburg is how to become more globally competitive without
abandoning the valuable European traditions and practices responsible for
its 30 years of primacy in London. As the chairman of a rival UK securities
firm said: 'Warburg has got to be careful not to throw the baby out with the
bathwater.'
Lord Cairns' goal is clear. 'We want to be a European version of whatever
they (the leading US firms) are.' American rivals have very profitable
domestic operations, just as Warburg has a powerful UK operation. But they
have a bigger share of international capital markets business, ranking ahead
of Warburg in league tables for the issuance of Eurobonds, other debt
securities and equities distributed in more than one country.
Warburg insists it is not interested in market share, but in profitability.
However, on this measure too, it lags behind many American competitors.
Despite growing challenges, Warburg remains the most successful of the UK's
integrated securities houses. Over the past seven years, it has outperformed
firms such as Barclays de Zoete Wedd, County NatWest and Kleinwort Benson in
penetrating overseas markets, and has been more profitable.
However, the performance of its global investment banking business looks
less impressive if the high returns earned by Mercury Asset Management, the
leading fund management group which has been partly demerged from Warburg,
are ignored. Without the inclusion of Mercury's earnings in calculations,
Warburg's profits as a percentage of its shareholders' funds - or its return
on capital - has exceeded 20 per cent only once in the past five years.
Otherwise the return has varied between 14 per cent and 16 per cent, until
it slipped sharply in the first half of the current year to less than 6 per
cent, due in part to some exceptional factors.
'There is no denying we have not had the return on capital which we would
have wanted to have and intend to have,' said Lord Cairns. His aim is to get
it to at least 20 per cent, excluding Mercury.
Warburg would be more profitable if more UK companies used it as a one-stop
shop for financial services, as it hoped they would at the time of Big Bang
in 1986, when London's securities market was deregulated. But a majority of
Warburg's clients still insist that it works either with another broker or
another merchant bank on any particular deal. 'We can't press the case too
hard (for using Warburg on its own), because it sounds like pure
self-interest,' Lord Cairns said. 'We've got to wait for it to catch on.'
A further factor in holding profits down has been Warburg's substantial
investments since Big Bang in overseas operations, where 40 per cent of
employees are based. 'Because of our perception that financial markets will
be global, there is a willingness to accept lower returns for a while to
establish ourselves in overseas markets,' said Lord Cairns.
Lord Cairns became chief executive 18 months ago, taking over many of the
responsibilities then held by Sir David Scholey who, as chairman, remains
involved in formulating the firm's strategy. Lord Cairns' methods of
boosting profits have to a certain extent been outside the Warburg tradition
in that they have involved bigger job cuts than in the past.
'Last year we looked at the (costs) of the business very hard,' Lord Cairns
said. As a result, about 100 UK jobs were axed. There was an uprecedented
reduction of about 20 in the corporate finance department, the traditional
heart of the firm.
Lord Cairns said this rigorous approach would be continued: 'Are we going to
continue to look at the business in a more hard-boiled way than in the past?
Yes, a bit.'
However, some Warburg staff fear a tough job-cutting programme could erode
the loyalty of employees and put Warburg's valuable culture at risk. The
essence of the culture - which one executive described as 'almost
Stalinist', though Lord Cairns preferred to call it 'slightly Japanese' - is
that the good of the firm comes before that of the individual.
Long-established practices include never going to meetings with client alone
 -always in pairs or groups - and extensive note-taking. When telephoning
clients, executives often listen in to each other.
But maintaining the cohesion of the firm has become more difficult as its
size has increased. In 1981, it employed 660 - and even then the founder,
Sir Siegmund Warburg, feared it had become too big. Today it employs 5,090,
75 per cent of whom have joined since 1986.
Nonetheless, rivals agree that a high staff turnover has not dented its
professional standards. 'Their culture remains one of their major
strengths,' said a senior executive of a US firm. 'In meetings, they are
tremendously professional,' said a UK merchant banker.
While its professionalism appears to be safeguarded, an important element in
Warburg's corporate philosophy is under review. The firm has traditionally
avoided taking big positions in shares or securities, because of a concern
that this would lead clients to question the impartiality of its advice -
and also partly because it regarded trading for its own account as risky.
However, its American rivals take substantial positions in securities and
derivative instruments, such as swaps and options, in the knowledge that the
risk inherent in one position is being offset by another. The result has
been that they have used their capital to make big profits, with
comparatively little risk.
Lord Cairns admits that Warburg's systems for controlling the risks of
making loans or holding securities and derivative instruments have been less
sophisticated than those of US rivals: 'We have been too literal in seeing
the risks separately. We have not bundled up the risks and measured the
combination of them.'
He foresees Warburg trading in securities for its own account more often.
However, he retains 'a natural aversion to getting as far down the line (in
holding securities) as the US firms'.
For their part, some American firms are delighted at Warburg's cautious
approach. One chairman said: 'I don't think Warburg can afford its
scruples.' In its international battle, 'relative aggression' may not be
enough.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Letter: Limitations of economic analysis on road pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr CHRISTOPHER P RAYMOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Giles Keating's article 'Absence of road pricing takes its toll'
(February 11) rightly concludes that the practice of charging directly for
roadway usage would, if implemented, '. . .offer a way of slashing the PSBR,
while reducing congestion and pollution and creating the base for a world
class high technology industry'. In attempting to urge this policy on to the
British political agenda, the author cites the German government as one body
which has already awakened to the 'almost overwhelming' economic arguments
in its favour.
However, in a separate article appearing in the same issue ('German motorway
charge drives into trouble'), the reader is told of deep-felt and widespread
opposition to the German road pricing plan. Apparently, even the Greens are
opposed to the idea] (According to their rather inane claim, motorists would
actually increase highway usage in response to the charges 'to get value for
money'.)
As an economist, I am well acquainted with the theoretical arguments put
forward by Mr Keating, and quite sympathetic to his views. One should also,
though, be aware of the limitations of economic analysis. As a social
science, economics is much better at providing ways to approach problems
than it is at finding solutions.
When individuals have preferences only over the goods they consume
privately, then one can talk (in theory, at least) about 'efficient'
solutions to economic problems. But when individuals also have preferences
about the method by which those products are allocated (ie of means as well
as ends), then economic considerations must be balanced against political
ones. Economic arguments notwithstanding, 'free' road provision is (by
definition) a more efficient system for generating revenue and allocating
road space if it is universally preferred to other such systems.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Letter: Domination by US in oil services inevitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C PAUL HALLWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Please allow me to comment on David Lascelles' article, 'Still plenty
of North Sea life' (February 6) on the the North Sea oil industry. I
published a book on the subject a couple of years ago (Transaction Costs and
Trade Between Multinational Corporations: A Study of Offshore Oil
Production). David Lascelles is exactly right. British suppliers of inputs
into offshore oil production have made very little impact on the wider world
industry which remains dominated by American multinationals.
The reasons are not hard to find. The oil industry originated in the US,
with American companies gaining advantages that they have never
relinquished. They have fought to sustain their lead effectively, keeping
British competitors at bay. For example, my study showed that American
affiliates were on average the first to establish themselves in the Aberdeen
service base; they predominate in the technological core of the industry;
they own the bulk of the industry's patents; and they spend more on R&amp;D.
Moreover, the American affiliates in Aberdeen are small within their
respective ownership groups - reflecting the prior globalisation of the
parents' activities.
As the British find it so hard to compete on their own turf it is not
surprising that they cannot compete elsewhere - they simply come up against
the same superior competition and without the benefit of the albeit slim
protection afforded by British trade policy towards the industry, British
success stories do exist but they are hard to find.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Arts: Mr Dowland's Musicke - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Consort of Musicke presented three concerts last weekend in celebration
of one of our finest composers: 'The Renaissance Triumphs of Mr Dowland.'
One of the striking factors was how much of the music dealt with love.
Love's pain, love's reward, love's despair, love's wound, love's constancy,
love-in-death, and more: courtly love in all its changing moods. So said the
words, some by Anon. (in top form), some by Petrarch, some by Tasso. Amor,
amor, amor; and Dowland and his contemporaries addressed it with the full
breadth and intensity of the Renaissance mind.
How odd, though, to hear these songs sung by the Consort of Musicke's six
singers. The emotion that consumed Paola and Francesca, or Romeo and Juliet
has never touched these voices. The two sopranos, two tenors, one alto and
one bass aim, it would seem, at some notion of chaste angelic purity. Theirs
is a lean, well-scrubbed, holier-than-thou sound, an imitation of Paradise
as glimpsed from King's College Chapel, Cambridge, and desperately
prepubescent. Such voices are not only bent on heaven, but also on passing
en route through the eye of a needle. All flesh has been painstakingly pared
away.
The first concert placed Dowland, ingeniously and fascinatingly, in context
of his European contemporaries by taking us through the cities he visited,
and giving his songs in context of those composed at the same time in Paris,
Brunswick, Kassel, Venice, Ferrara, Florence and Copenhagen. The academic
French preoccupation with neoclassical fusion of rhythm, words, melody and
harmony and the new Italian emphasis on dramatic utterance were the two
currents that emerged most forcefully. Anthony Rooley, the Consort's
director and lutenist, provided amiable, semi-audible narration.
The second concert was all Dowland; the third involved all his English
circle. There is a devout audience for the Consort's way of putting over
Dowland &amp; Co; at the second concert, even standing room was packed. I was
aware that my dissent is exceptional; you could sense the family feeling
between musicians and house. Nonetheless, the second concert still sounded
to me like Dowland as conceived in a latterday English nursery. The few
songs that omitted mention of love addressed death, and the singers became
dutifully solemn. But the sounds of adult morbidity was as absent as erotic
affliction had been.
At the first concert, Emma Kirkby, the Consort's most celebrated singer, was
absent with a cold; at the second concert, the tenor Joseph Cornwell was
absent. To my ear theirs are the Consort's most relaxed voices. Cornwell's
tenor is the best-nourished; it has calm and sweetness. Kirkby, even when
under the weather, has real brightness. It is peculiar to hear her voice
beside that of her fellow-soprano, Evelyn Tubb: Kirkby sounding like a
bright little cherub, Tubb like a contrived and plaintive treble choirboy.
And it is peculiar to hear how often Consort singers - Tubb most obviously,
but Kirkby and others sometimes too - try to direct their voices just
beneath important notes. You drain the voice of any of the natural vibrato
evident elsewhere and you try to sing the emphatic notes ever so slightly
flat - as if this made things more expressive. I love these songs, but two
concerts of this singing was more than enough; and I absented myself from
the third.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Arts: Lovely space, shame about the content - William Packer
reviews 'Young British Artists II' at the Saatchi gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a pleasure to visit the Saatchi Collection, to pass through those
heavy grey steel doors into that bare, white courtyard, with its blind turn
down to the left - just the way a latter-day Cocteau would lead us down
again into the Underworld. Don't look back. Through another blank grey door
into the clear lobby and still the place keeps its secrets. Only when we
turn to the right, and step down into a vast, whiter, brighter space, does
the full shock of the place strike us like a blow.
We are in what is not only one of the largest and most beautiful exhibition
spaces that I know, but also, perhaps, the most remarkable. To enter it is
not merely to see it, but actually to feel it, with a palpable frisson of
sensibility. Workshop or whatever before its conversion, it is now the
perfect place for showing art, or showing anything. A Rembrandt, a bowl of
fruit, a pair of legs or a bicycle wheel would look as well in that sharply
focused, undistracted and celebratory light. Here perhaps lies the problem,
for to celebrate is not always to discriminate. And what of the art?
Four young British artists are in this latest show. They share no common
interest or practice, yet there is a certain character in common, that says
rather more about their imaginative conditioning than about the particular
nature of their work. In each case, the idea, the concept, comes first, with
the means of its expression or realisation merely a secondary and technical,
in the case of the sculptors, highly technical consideration.
The work does not change and develop its process. The artist does not
respond intuitively and directly to what is happening under his hand. There
is no sense of discovery or surprise, of the artist doing more than he
imagined, going so much further than he anticipated. All is organised,
thoroughly professional.
Sarah Lucas finds her imagery in the tabloid press at its most flagrantly
extreme, in its pandering to carnal appetite and its particular treatment of
women as sexual objects. The chosen images are amplified by photocopy and
collaged onto large canvases with but little other intervention on the her
part. She also shows assortments of objects set out on tables, of ambiguous
but evidently potent significance. She is operating, we are told, 'as an
aesthetic terrorist, pillaging mainstream culture . . . monitoring the
sexism and misogyny routinely found there.'
Rose Finn-Kelcey offers two quasi-industrial installations, one warm, one
cool. A refrigerated cabinet, large enough to walk into, contains an object
like a small sentry-box or up-ended coffin made entirely of ice-cubes. And,
in a darkened side-gallery, steam rises from a broad metal base to the
matching ventilator hood above, a swirling, untidy mass of vapour caught in
the spotlight. For the artist thus to be intrigued by evanescent material is
not in itself unreasonable, for art is ever teased by the fleeting moment,
experience caught even as it passes. Here she has yet to move beyond the
merely technological demonstration - an ice-box preserved in an ice-box: the
production and containment of a cloud of steam.
Marc Quinn has poured some nine pints of his own blood into a mould taken of
his own head, after the normal method of the life-cast, and which he now
preserves in the refrigerator as his frozen self-portrait, as permanent as
the power supply. A life-cast is, well, a life-cast, a purely technical
exercise that involves no modelling nor self-scrutiny whatever, but only a
degree of practical care. The only point that might raise the piece above
the banal is that it is made of blood. It is certainly an arresting if
macabre side-show, but is it anything more? 'By casting his own substance in
a mould of his own features, Quinn resolves a key sculptural issue - the
relationship between form and content.' Hmmmmm.
He has also cast series of heads in bronze or lead, that are pastiches upon
the baroque virtuosity of a Houdon or a Roubiliac. But who would dare to
risk such a comparison too far? Quinn models his heads of Marie-Antoinette
or Louis XVI in dough, which rises in the baking and is distorted in the
rising, before making his definitive mould. Image without responsibility,
the perfect let-out. The pity is that these objects, carried off as they are
with some considerable panache and flair, suggest that with a more
substantial initial commitment to the modelling, something more substantial
might be achieved.
Mark Wallinger shows two series of large paintings, one, called 'Race,
Class, Sex', of thoroughbreds standing at Sheik Mohammed's stud at
Newmarket, the other, 'Capital', of down-and-out characters standing in
front of the anonymous brass doors of City banks. The gloss is earnestly
correct, in its worrying about bloodlines, the economics of breeding, and
the sociology of ownership and the sport itself. The down-and-outs
(Wallinger's friends dressed down) present the inevitable contrast between
poverty and affluence to an unfeeling world.
Oh dear. The pity here is that Wallinger is in prospect a better painter
than he allows himself to be with his attitudinising, his 'investigation of
the traditional genres of oil-painting', his firing-off at obvious,
simple-minded social targets. He does everything from photographs, which is
nothing if not a distancing device. He loves horses and racing, but we shall
never know it until he begins to respond directly and unselfconsciously to
what he sees and feels.
It is never the moralising that makes the art. Velasquez painted the Court
Dwarfs, as discomfiting a subject as could be imagined. But he painted them
as they were, as he saw and knew them, and left them at that. They stand
among the greatest images of humanity ever painted.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Arts: Emanuel Ax - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday afternoon in a well-filled Queen Elizabeth Hall, Ax offered a
curiously salon-ish, undemanding programme: three French standards, and
Schumann's Carnaval. After his distinguished account of Schoenberg's piano
concerto with the Philharmonia, just two months ago, it promised a piquant
contrast. Ax is never less than a thoroughbred musician, but it should have
been more interesting than it was.
He began with Debussy's early suite Pour le piano, which used to be the
party-piece of many a lady pianist. Though he made it shapely and
well-balanced, a party-piece was just what it failed to sound like; its
'cheap thrills' (very effectively designed by the composer) were rendered
tasteful to a fault. To Ravel's Valses nobles et sentimentales Ax brought
plenty of thoughtful delicacy, often a pleasure in itself; but music-box
echoes - which can be charming in two or three numbers, by way of contrast -
were too pervasive by far.
In the advertised programme, this first half would have culminated with the
Sonata of Henri Dutilleux, a fine virtuoso work that still waits in the
wings of the repertoire. Excellent planning; but incomprehensibly, Ax chose
to replace it with Franck's Prelude, Aria and Finale, at the best of times a
worthy, musty affair. Occupying the dead centre of the programme (and 'dead'
was the word), cruelly preceded by Ravel and Debussy, it sounded a damp
academic squib.
Musically speaking, nothing was wrong with Carnaval after the interval. Ax
dealt out Schumann's mischievous hand of cards with careful tenderness.
Without the least sense of mischief, however - eg in 'Harlequin', and
'Reconnaissance'; nor was there any cajoling brilliance in Ax's 'Papillons'
or 'Paganini', nor did his expert Finale ever risk going into a reckless
whirl. Exciting performances of Carnaval, and even memorable ones, are not
so rare; this one set a tame, honest seal on a recital that ought to have
been much more fun.

For anyone suffering from a surfeit of Morse and Home Counties escapism it
will be a relief to welcome back Taggart, the Glasgow cop who is as gritty
and down to earth as his city. He shares Morse's grumpiness but is miles
more credible. Mark McManus investigates the murder of a policeman's wife,
helped by the personable James Macpherson, in the first of a three parter
starting at 9pm on ITV.
Although health is a national and, presumably, personal obsession it
receives very little television coverage. Pulse , a new series on Channel 4
at 8.30 pm, helps to redress the balance. But it's a bad sign that it has
Emma Freud fronting it rather than an expert .
Dame Edna Everage is used to handing it out, making fools of the famous and
the innocent. She is at last on the receiving end in Without Walls (Channel
4 at 9pm), where impressionist Rory Bremner uses the J'accuse spot to point
out the cruelty which he believes has replaced the wit. This is followed by
a look at the prospects of American child star Macaulay Culkin, who
currently earns USDollars 5m (Pounds 3.5m) a movie.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Arts: Der fliegende Hollander - Opera in Amsterdam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was at least one notable turn-around in the balance of payments during
the 1980s. After a decade or more in which Britain regularly imported opera
producers from overseas, usually Germany both East and West, the trade is
now starting to go in the opposite direction - British producers are
increasingly to be found at work in the opera-houses of continental Europe.
The Muziektheater in Amsterdam has proved among the keenest to sample the
British product. The new production of Der fliegende Hollander, which opened
there at the end of January, is by Richard Jones, probably the most quirky
British talent of his generation. We have come a long way since the
political Wagner of the East Germans, which was starting to become so
predictable a few years ago. This whole evening was typically bizarre,
invigorating, full of panache.
It also looked stylish. In Nigel Lowery's designs the theme of the
Dutchman's picture, which has obsessed Senta, was applied to the opera as a
whole. The stage itself was encased in a giant frame and every scene within
it took the form of a black-and-white line drawing - a quite dazzlingly
effective idea, although it was a shame that the changes of set were so
cumbersome. A better feeling for the technical side of theatre was needed
here.
The only character to be seen in colour throughout was the Dutchman, in an
appropriate, deep-sea blue. Senta was most definitely restricted to drab
greys from the outset. For in this production she has become the archetypal
Plain Jane, her bearing hunched, her hair hanging lifeless, resentful,
defensive, obsessive, the object of spite and ostracism on the part of the
other girls in the spinning factory: a right odd-ball, in fact.
On her stooping shoulders rested all that this production had to say and it
was thanks to Kathryn Harries's brilliant portrayal that it said it with
such conviction. The meeting between her and the Dutchman was the high-point
of the evening. In no other staging have I understood so well the feelings
that overwhelm Senta, as she is faced in real life with the man she has
idolised in his portrait for so long. This was an powerful confrontation and
it hardly mattered that Harries's soprano only has an intermittent hold on
sure focus and beauty of tone.
Wolfgang Schone's Dutchman, a Nordic traveller with long, blond hair, was
nothing like so individual a character. One sensed he was there merely to
act as a catalyst in the fulfilment of Senta's destiny, rather than vice
versa, as would seem to be the case from the story. Nevertheless, he sang
with sufficient power and clearer German words than most of his colleagues.
Kenneth Garrison was the unsubtle, full-steam-ahead-on-each-note Erik; Artur
Korn sang Daland and Glenn Winslade an appealing Steersman.
It would be nice to report that the musical side of the evening had the same
strength of purpose as the dramatic, but that was not really so. Christof
Perick encouraged the right blended Wagnerian sounds from the pit, but there
was not the dynamism that can make this relatively early Wagner score
exciting, nor the ability to drive home the big moments. The men's choruses,
so important a feature, lacked certainty of attack too often.
Perhaps some of the stage business put them off. For the spinning chorus the
ladies had no spinning-wheels, but wiggled their fore-fingers in the air;
the sailors had no ropes to pull on and were left performing physical
exercises. Before she met the Dutchman, Senta fell through his picture and
returned dressed in blue. In another twist the brightly-coloured pictures of
fish which hung on the wall at the beginning had turned into black-and-white
fishbones by the end.
All very amusing and strange, but then that was half the fascination of the
evening. British Wagner is set to be a far less predictable commodity.
Performances continue at the Muziektheater until February 21

FT  16 FEB 93 / Legal Briefs: Linklaters &amp; Paines top Eurobond advisers'
league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATECHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ANNUAL league table of law firms that advise on Eurobond issues has
placed City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines top for the fourth year running.
The solicitors were involved as advisers to the lead managers of 341 issues
in 1992, well clear of nearest rival Allen &amp; Overy, which came second for
its part in 199 issues. Slaughter and May ranked third for its involvement
in 77 issues.
According to the International Financial Law Review, which publishes the
table, there was a marked increase in the total value of Eurobond
transactions during 1992 as investors sought safer havens for their money.
Instability in the world equity markets, chaos in European currency exchange
rates and uncertainty over interest rate levels all played their part as
transaction values reached Dollars 287bn (Pounds 190bn) compared with
Dollars 255bn in 1991.
The full league table places the UK's Clifford Chance fourth with 59 issues;
the French firm Giroux Buhagiar &amp; Associes fifth with 31; the US firm Cleary
Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton sixth with 28; the UK's Freshfields seventh with
22 issues; the Dutch firm De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek eighth with 17; and
Canada's Stikeman Elliott, America's Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell and France's
Simeon et Associes equal ninth with 16 issues.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Legal Briefs: 10-year Bendectin case nears close
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 10-year legal battle in the US federal courts over whether Merrell Dow
Pharmaceutical's anti-nausea drug Bendectin causes birth defects has finally
reached the US Supreme Court.
The case is being followed by corporate America with great interest even
though the issues involved are relatively straightforward. The court is
expected to announce for the first time a standard for determining when
expert scientific evidence can be admitted in both civil and criminal cases.
Scientists, politicians, lawyers and companies have long disagreed on
whether and to what extent judges and juries are hoodwinked by phony or
unreliable expert evidence. Corporate America believes unreliable evidence
by 'experts' has been largely responsible for the huge jury awards against
American companies in recent years.
Merrell Dow has successfully defended itself against almost all of the 2,000
lawsuits that alleged that Bendectin causes limb deformities. From 1957 to
1983, when Bendectin was removed from the market, more than 33m women in 21
countries used the drug.
The critical issue concerns proof that it is more likely than not that the
drug caused the deformities. According to the US National Law Journal the
parties involved usually rely on epidemiological or human evidence.
So far, epidemiological studies performed on humans before the drug was
removed from the market have failed to show a statistically significant
relationship between the drug's use and birth defects.
Attempts to prove a causal link by expert evidence based on chemical
analysis and animal studies have so far been ruled inadmissible by the US
courts.
This is on the basis that an expert opinion on a scientific technique is
only admissible if it is 'generally accepted' as a reliable technique within
the scientific community.
At the moment the courts are agreed that human or epidemiological evidence
is the only reliable proof that a drug is a non-genetic cause of birth
defects. It is this scientific controversy that the Supreme Court must sort
out.

The European Commission has been told by the European Court of Justice to
repay money withheld from a trader who was late in delivering goods covered
by European Community food-aid rules.
Cebag, a Dutch exporter, sued the Commission for payments due under a
food-aid tender contract relating to colza oil destined for Uganda,
Mozambique and Bangladesh. The Commission claimed Cebag made late deliveries
of the oil allocated to it under the tender and therefore it was entitled to
withhold delivery guarantees by making deductions from the final payment.
Delay in delivery was not disputed.
The main legal issue arose from the fact that the Commission had notified
Cebag that it had been released from its delivery guarantees but then
proceeded to deduct Ecu104,508 (Pounds 84,860) from the sum due at final
payment.
This deduction was contrary to a ruling by the European Court of Justice in
January 1991 in which the court interpreted the EC food-aid rules as
precluding the Commission from making deductions for late delivery.
When Cebag requested repayment of the money, however, the Commission
refused. In its telexed refusal, which Cebag asked the ECJ to annul, the
Commission said no reliance could be placed on the court's January 1991
ruling in respect of payments made before that date.
In confirming its previous ruling the court rejected the Commission's
arguments. The court held only renunciation of the right to reimbursement,
which had not been suggested by the Commission, or legal prescription, which
was no longer contended by the Commission, could prevent Cebag's claim.
The court also upheld Cebag's claim for interest on the late payment.
Two unusual procedural points were raised by this case. First, the court
decided there should be no oral hearing; and second, Cebag brought claims
under the Rome treaty provisions which give the court jurisdiction to give
judgment in respect of any arbitration clause contained in a contract
concluded by or on behalf of the Community whether the contract is governed
by private or public law.
The Commission had argued Cebag's application was inadmissible because the
legal relationship between the Commission and the tenderer was exclusively
governed by the provisions in the relevant EC food-aid regulations and that
the provisions referring to the jurisdiction of the court did not amount to
an arbitration clause incorporated in the contract between the Commission
and Cebag.
The court disagreed. It said the legal relationship was also subject to the
terms of the tender contract and that the provisions granting jurisdiction
to the ECJ were an integral part of the contract which were to be treated as
an arbitration clause within the meaning of the treaty.
Case C-142/91, Cebag BV v Commission, ECJ 5CH, 11 February 1993.
Inward-processing entitlement
IN THE course of proceedings between Textilveredlungsunion (TVU) and German
customs in respect of a claim for repayment of customs duties, the Munich
Finanzgeright asked the ECJ to interpret certain of the European Community's
inward-processing rules. EC inward-processing rules cover imported goods or
raw materials which are processed in the Community and then re-exported.
In general customs duties paid on the imported goods are refundable after
they are re-exported. The duties reclaimed by TVU had been paid in
connection with yarn imported from Korea by another German company which had
then been re-exported to Bulgaria after TVU had dyed the yarn under a
subcontract.
The court ruled that it was for the German court to decide the meaning of
the inward-processing regime applicable to TVU as a sub-contractor. However,
the court clarified details of the EC inward-processing rules. It said where
the processing of non-Community material was carried out for a principal
established within the EC customs territory, the sub-contractor could apply
for inward-processing relief but must do so in the name of the principal.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Pepper added to Maxwell bean-feast -
Robert Rice and John Mason examine the fall-out from a House of Lords'
ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The House of Lords' recent ruling in Pepper v Hart that Hansard - the
official journal of UK parliamentary debates - could be used to assist in
interpretating legislation was seen at the time as a decision likely to
cause many a legal hiccup.
So it has proved. Mr Larry Trachtenberg, one of four men charged in
connection with the collapse of Robert Maxwell's empire, used the ruling to
challenge the power of the Serious Fraud Office to compel suspects to answer
questions.
The SFO's power is granted under section 2 of the 1987 Criminal Justice Act.
Section 8 of the act allows suspects to claim a 'reasonable excuse' for not
answering questions, and this was used by Mr Trachtenberg.
Mr Trachtenberg's 'reasonable excuse' was that he was being asked to give an
account of the theft and fraud charges he faced before the prosecution had
stated its own case. In effect, he argued, he was being asked to provide the
case against him. This, he said, was contrary to a fundamental principle of
English criminal law: that the prosecution must prove its case, unaided by
the accused.
It is clear from Hansard reports of the passage of the 1987 bill that
parliament did not intend that this principle should be overridden by the
section 2 powers, Mr Trachtenberg said. Mr Christopher Bourke, the
stipendiary magistrate, agreed.
However the magistrate's decision to dismiss the charge that Mr Trachtenberg
refused to answer questions came as a surprise after a related lords' ruling
last summer.
That ruling concerned a similar refusal by Mr Wallace Duncan Smith to answer
SFO questions. He had argued that the SFO's powers ceased once the accused
had been charged. In any event, once charged, the SFO director was obliged
to caution him under the terms of the code of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act (Pace); under the code suspects are not obliged to answer
questions, but anything they say could be used in evidence against them.
The law lords rejected both arguments. As a matter of interpretation, the
lords said, the powers of the SFO director did not cease after charges had
been made and common sense dictated that the general provisions of the Pace
code yielded to specific provisions of the 1987 act when the act applied.
But Mr Bourke said the Smith case had not dealt with the issue of
'reasonable excuse' and had come before the Pepper v Hart decision last
November. Therefore the law lords had not been able to refer to Hansard to
determine the parliamentary intent behind the legislation.
Mr Bourke said it was clear from reading Hansard that the Criminal Justice
Act did not reverse the rule that the prosecution has the burden of proving
the charges unaided by the accused.
'Parliament did not, either by silence or implication, abandon that rule. On
the contrary, parliament was astute to preserve it,' Mr Bourke said.
His decision was welcomed by law firms specialising in white collar crime
defence work.
'This is a welcome reassertion of the rights of the defendant within the
criminal justice system,' said Mr Monty Raphael of Peters and Peters, the
firm representing Mr Trachtenberg's co-defendant, Mr Kevin Maxwell.
The SFO says it is reviewing its position. However an appeal seems certain
since the ruling raises serious implications for both the powers and
procedures of the SFO.
If the decision to dismiss the charges against Mr Trachtenberg is not
overturned, the implications for the SFO could be considerable. The number
of section 2 notices issued to people already charged are relatively few.
The vast majority of the almost 800 notices issued each year are served
either before charges are made or on banks.
However in the often long and complex investigations handled by the SFO, the
emergence, late in the day, of fresh evidence and new avenues of inquiry is
not unusual. If a wall came down on the use of section 2 powers after
charges were laid it could prevent the prosecution obtaining crucial
evidence necessary for conviction.
One solution, observers note, is the possibility of fresh legislation being
passed. One amendment in the current Criminal Justice Bill would be enough
to resolve the matter and render obsolete any arguments based on Pepper v
Hart.
But it is not just the powers of the SFO that have been upset by the Pepper
v Hart ruling.
The drafting of new insider dealing legislation has already hit choppy
waters. Defining precisely at what point information becomes public has
antagonised many in the City of London. Treasury ministers taking the bill
through parliament have been forced onto the defensive, issuing verbal
reassurances from the despatch box that the government has no intention to
fundamentally alter current market practice.
In the light of Pepper v Hart, such reassurances could rebound badly on the
legislators, leaving the door wide open for legal challenges.
One lawyer said: 'Unless the bill is more tightly drafted, they could get
'Peppered and Harted' all over the shop. It will be an absolute bean-feast
for lawyers, but who else?'

FT  16 FEB 93 / People: Seelig and Hawley resurface at Hay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Almost a year to the day since the Guinness trial in which he stood accused
of fraud and false accounting collapsed because of his impaired mental
health, former corporate finance star Roger Seelig (right) has picked up his
first new directorship of a public company - a small, struggling,
engineering concern called Norman Hay.
Peter Hay, 42, who becomes chairman, stepping into the shoes of his brother
Anthony, 56, says he has known Seelig socially for the past three or four
years. 'Call me you foolish if you like,' he says, 'but I believe it is
quite a coup for a small company like ours. He was a guy of enormous talent
and I have nothing but respect for his brilliant mind.'
At the same time, Hay is bringing in as chief executive 47-year-old Mel
Hawley, who stepped down as chief executive of Haden MacLellan Holdings, an
engineering company with a market capitalisation eight times as big, at the
beginning of this month after only a year in the position. Hay thinks that
while HMH has suffered severely during the recession, Hawley had previously
proved he was 'somebody used to making companies grow'. Anthony Hay is
stepping down because of ill health but will remain on the board in a
non-executive capacity.
Hay expects a pre-tax loss of at least Pounds 2.2m for 1992, partly as the
result of delays and unexpectedly high costs incurred in relocating from
Heathrow to Coventry. With his involvement in the development of near-by
Stockley Park, Seelig's first task will be to find ways of generating income
from the 7 1/2 acre site by the tunnel entrance to Heathrow that Norman Hay
is now left with. 'As the business stabilises and we are ready to acquire,
Roger the grand tactician will then come to the fore. I hope he can prove
himself again at Norman Hay,' says the new chairman.
The 47-year-old former Morgan Grenfell corporate financier acknowledges this
is 'a tiny step' in his rehabiltation, but claims other appointments are to
follow. 'One of the gratifying things about the past six years has been how
senior people - chairmen and chief executives - have stayed in contact
throughout. To suggest I have become a hillbilly - even if I farm part-time
 -is not right,' Seelig said from home yesterday.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Technology: Rescuing the Peruca dam - Croatian engineers
risked their lives to open the sluice gates and safeguard 20,000 people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Serbian militia came 'within an ace' last month of destroying the Peruca dam
in Croatia, threatening the lives of 20,000 people, according to British
engineers who travelled to the war zone to help make the dam safe.
Only the robust nature of the dam's design and construction and the fact
that the water level was not higher prevented an immediate disaster,
according to Paul Back, chief technical director of consulting engineers Sir
Alexander Gibb.
Back, an international expert on dams, was one of three Britons who
travelled to the Dalmatian coast to assist the Croatians. The others were
Derek Wilden, head of Gibb's hydro-mechanical engineering division, and
Terry Pike, chief engineering adviser to the Overseas Development
Administration.
They praised the Croatian engineers, who risked their lives by opening
sluice gates - feared to have been booby trapped - to lower the water level
in the lake.
'Without this immediate action, more of the clay core in the centre of the
dam might have been washed away with terrible consequences,' said Back.
Peruca is an embankment dam, the impervious clay core enclosed in sloping
shoulders of local limestone. The stone protects the core and gives the 450
metre-long, 65 metre-high dam its strength. It holds back up to 541m cubic
metres of water, more than twice the volume of Kielder, England's largest
dam.
'It is not easy to blow up a dam when it has been designed to withstand
earth movements in an area of high seismic activity,' says Back.
Three separate blasts - one alone is estimated to have involved 15 tonnes of
explosive - are thought to have occurred in an inspection tunnel running
through the centre of the structure.
The crest of the dam above the explosions sagged by more than two metres.
The immediate threat was that water would pour over the gaps washing the
structure away and accomplishing what the explosions failed to do on their
own.
'That was why it was so important to get the sluice gates open and reduce
the level of water,' says Back.
The next problem was to identify what other damage had been done to the
structure. Most worrying was that water pouring from an access tunnel to the
damaged inspection gallery, 15 metres from the top of the dam, was chocolate
brown - indicating that the clay core was being steadily eroded. If the core
was destroyed there would be nothing to prevent water pouring through the
limestone and washing it away completely.
The first task has been to reduce the level of the water to below the
inspection tunnel outlet to see if this would halt the damage to the core.
The emergence of large sink holes at the southern end of the dam has
suggested it is there that water has been getting into the core. Silty clay
has been used to backfill the sink holes in the hope that this would
replenish the damaged core.
That work is still continuing and it could be several weeks before the dam
is finally considered safe. A remote-controlled submarine with a video
camera provided with operators by Shoreline Engineering of Britain has been
carrying out extensive surveys to assess the damage and whether the
structure is booby-trapped.
Engineers are also using dyes to establish the course of the seepage which
has been damaging the core. Once the water level has been sufficiently
reduced, there will be a joint inspection by Croatian and British engineers
to assess what repairs might be needed. Dams would appear to be natural
terrorist targets given the massive destructive potential of hundreds of
millions of tonnes of water suddenly being unleashed.
In reality, they are very difficult to destroy, as Peruca has shown. 'Dams
are designed to withstand huge natural forces which are much greater than
most man-made devices,' says Back.
He quotes an incident in 1986 when he was sent to investigate the failure of
the Kantalai dam in Sri Lanka, which was feared to have been caused by Tamil
terrorists.
The clay embankment dam built in 600 AD had been 'improved' last century by
Royal Engineers from Britain who had dug a culvert built in dressed stone,
using a lime-based mortar. Rather than any actions by terrorists, it was
erosion of the clay through the mortar that had caused the dam to collapse

FT  16 FEB 93 / People: Barker boards at Resort
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tim Barker, deputy group chief executive of Kleinwort Benson and a former
director general of the Takeover Panel, has accepted his first outside
directorship and is going on to the board of Resort Hotels as deputy
chairman.
He replaces David Tonkinson, 66, who has been a non-executive director of
the mid-market hotel chain since 1987, becoming deputy chairman the
following year. Tonkinson, a former managing partner of the Brighton office
of Grant Thornton, stays on the board. 'With the current Cadbury
recommendations, he was happy to stand aside for someone with as much
prestige as Tim Barker,' says managing director Robert Feld.
Feld adds that it is intended Barker should replace Dick Strong as chairman
around the end of this year. Strong, 63, had a venture capital background -
having been a director of Charterhouse Development Capital Holdings - but
Feld says that it was now appropriate for someone with quoted company
experience to come on board. Barker, 52, was head of corporate finance at KB
between 1986 and 1990.
Last November, Resort's share price had slumped as low as 16p - persistent
selling by one institutional shareholder, says Feld - but it has since
recovered, closing yesterday 5p stronger at 52 1/2 p despite the shares
going ex-dividend. The focus in coming months is to clear up any uncertainty
concerning the acquisitions of Country Resort Hotels and County Resort
Hotels and to win new management contracts, according to Feld.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Technology: Robot rubber tappers are ready to march - Labour
shortages in Malaysia are doing away with the traditional 'jebung'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strange things are happening on Malaysia's rubber plantations. Machines are
taking over from the traditional rubber tappers. Before long, robots could
be moving down the lines of trees, collecting the latex which goes to help
make the world's tyres and condoms, raincoats and surgical gloves.
Malaysia's rubber growers are facing serious problems. With one of the
fastest-growing economies in the Asian region, Malaysia is rapidly
industrialising.
A combination of acute labour shortages in the agricultural sector plus a
period of low prices has forced many rubber growers to abandon their trees.
Since 1988, Malaysia's rubber production has fallen by as much as 26 per
cent to 1.22m tonnes last year. Both Thailand and Indonesia are now bigger
producers.
Technicians at the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia are now battling to
prevent any further decline in what was once the country's premier industry.
The traditional method of extracting latex, the milky white raw rubber
liquid, is for the tapper to use his 'jebung' or tapping knife to cut a
groove at about 45 degrees round a quarter or half section of the tree.
The process requires considerable skill. The cut must not be too deep or the
wood or cambium of the tree will be damaged. The cut must also be done in
such a way as to allow a steady flow of latex into the collecting vessel.
In the conventional system, tapping takes place every other day. It is
carried out in the early morning when the pressure which forces the latex
out of the tree is at its strongest: a skilled tapper can tap between 400
and 700 trees in three hours. He then returns to collect the latex and take
it for processing into rubber bales at the factory.
RRI calculates that labour now accounts for about 70 per cent of rubber
production costs. The tappers - many of them descendants of Tamil workers
imported from southern India and Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, by the British - are
an ageing group. Rubber plantations are hot and often full of insects; most
young people prefer factory or office jobs.
A new method of mechanised tapping could provide the answer to many of
Malaysia's problems. Under the new system, a battery-driven machine the size
of a computer keyboard - remote control may be introduced later - and fitted
with a timing device, is tied to each tree, running round the trunk on a
notched wire. Every 24 hours, a small needle is pressed into the bark,
starting a latex flow.
'Puncture tapping could be one of the ways to preserve our rubber industry,'
says Zahid Mohammad, a researcher at RRI's 1,300-hectare experimental
station at Sungei Buloh outside Kuala Lumpur. 'It can be left on the tree
for a year and checked occasionally by the latex gatherers. The difficult
business of manual tapping could be eliminated.'
But the puncture-tapping method has its difficulties. The latex flow is not
so strong as with the conventional cut method. Various stimulants therefore
have to be given to the tree. One version of the machine comes with a small
gas canister attached. At intervals, the gas is funnelled into the tree to
stimulate latex flow.
'The trees are very like humans,' says Zahid. 'The latex is like the blood
flow. In the same way that you have to squeeze the arm and find the right
vein to get a good blood sample, so we have to establish the right place to
puncture the tree and apply the right stimulants to encourage the flow.'
Malaysia has about 1.8m hectares of its land planted with rubber, amounting
to about 700m trees. If the machines are mass produced, RRI calculates that
the cost of each will be less than MDollars 5 (Pounds 1.30). But RRI
realises that the machines do not provide all the answers.
Only about 20 per cent of Malaysia's rubber production comes from
plantations - the rest is carried out by many thousands of smallholders with
individual plots of between one and two hectares. Smallholders tend to be
considerably less efficient than the plantations and they are resistant to
change.
Some time ago, RRI invented a motorised tapping machine. The tapper would
cut the tree in the conventional way but could work much faster, covering
nearly 1,000 trees in a morning. But machines distributed by RRI were not
serviced properly by the smallholders and, at MDollars 250, were considered
to be too expensive.
While RRI continues to look at other machine-driven methods - including the
possibility of using robot machines to work up and down the rows of trees -
it is also working on other projects.
At one time, rubber trees had to be left to grow for eight years before
tapping could start. Now, trees of between four and five years are producing
latex.
Through cloning and seed research, it is hoped to bring the maturation
period down still further, while preserving the existing production lifespan
of more than 30 years.

The City Group for Smaller Companies (Cisco) hopes to get more than a foot
in the doors of Whitehall with the appointment of its first president, Lord
Clark of Kempston.
Lord Clark's connections after more than 30 years in parliament are expected
to give added weight to Cisco's proposals on smaller company requirements.
The group was launched last year, following Stock Exchange proposals to
dismantle the Unlisted Securities Market, and aims to protect the interests
of smaller companies in the City.
Richard Balarkas, Cisco's chief executive, says Lord Clark's involvement
will allow the group to 'get directly to the ministers involved'.
A former Tory MP with a career stretching back to 1959, Lord Clark, 70, has
served variously as deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, front-bench
spokesman on trade, finance and economics, and chairman of the Conservative
back-bench finance committee. Most recently, Lord Clark was on the committee
investigating alleged malpractices at the Lloyds insurance market. He was
promoted to the House of Lords last year.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Time nears for late
payers to be called to account
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Several thousand UK companies will be affected by legislation designed to
make them publish details in their accounts of the time they take to pay
suppliers. This requirement, which forms part of a government campaign to
encourage prompt payment, was announced by Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in
his last Budget and is planned to come into effect from December.
How many companies will be expected to collect payments information is not
yet clear. A consultative document was issued at the end of last month just
before the government pledged itself to assessing the impact on business of
future legislation. The document says companies covered by the Companies Act
definition of 'large' and not just listed companies will be included.
'Large' companies meet two or more of the following criteria: sales of more
than Pounds 11.2m, a balance sheet total of more than Pounds 3.9m and over
250 employees.
However, there are no readily available statistics on the number of large
companies though small firms specialists estimate between 4,000 and 7,000
could be affected, including 2,500 listed companies.
The decision to make 'large' companies publish the length of time it takes
them to settle bills is, in effect, an attempt to shame them into paying up
promptly. The problems small businesses face in getting paid have worsened
during the recession. Companies typically quote payment terms of 30 days but
on average wait 78 days.
The government is seeking a response to its consultative paper by March 27.
Its preferred option is for companies to disclose the ratio of trade
creditors to average purchases at the end of the financial year. That is
calculated by dividing the total amount of end-year trade creditors (already
in accounts) by average daily purchases (which are not, but which should be
determinable from other data).
The consultation paper also considers other methods, including two it views
as possible alternatives. One is 'countback', where a company adds up total
purchases for preceding months until the total equals the amount of trade
creditors shown at the year-end. The number of months required would show
the approximate time taken to pay. The second is 'age analysis' where a
company analyses the value and age of bills making up end-year creditors.
The choice has been influenced by the need for a system that does not add
significant administration costs, the consultation paper says. Only one
method of calculation will be allowed to enable comparisons, although
companies are free to add information. The figures will be required to be
audited.
Reporting will take the form of a note to the accounts showing the average
time taken to pay, in days. This information will be required for financial
years starting on or after December 23 1993. Grant Thornton, accountants,
called for tougher safeguards, however, and warned of the difficulty and
cost of verification.
Any average figure for payment delays is likely to understate the scale of
the problem facing many companies, said another accountant. Companies take
care to pay essential suppliers quickly but often make others wait longer.
Copies of the consultation document and a questionnaire are available from

523, 10-18 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0NN. Tel. 071 215 3238.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Testing personal capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yorkshire Enterprise, one of the longer-established venture capital funds in
the English regions, is using psychometric testing on entrepreneurs asking
for finance and help in growing their businesses.
The tests, which assess personality, motivation and inter-personal skills,
are being used where teamwork and team building are essential to business
development. Trained consultants administer the tests and interpret the
results.
Peter Claydon, YE's commercial director, says: 'We are not basing our
decisions entirely on what the tests reveal, but we use them to confirm
views we may have formed in interviews.'
Testing has been used six times in the last nine months, three times
involving new funds and the rest on business development, involving adding
more people to a management team. The sixth proposal was turned down. 'I
wouldn't say it was because of the tests, but they certainly underlined the
worries we had,' Claydon says.
YE invests in the Pounds 100,000-Pounds 250,000 range. About a third of its
150 investments have resulted in healthy exits through trade sales or
buy-backs by their managements. A third are still active with YE as a
hands-on investor, but the rest have failed.
There is a marked reluctance to back one-person managements nowadays, so
team quality and relationships are critical.
'Small businesses need a consensus builder to lead them, complemented by a
completer-finisher,' Claydon adds. 'Growing companies usually need a
chairman who can stand back and conciliate, a shaper of policy and a
resource gatherer.
'In the history of management buy-outs and buy-ins, there seems a critical
period after about three years. If the team is not complementary within
itself, this is when the strains tell and things start falling apart.
Testing looks like a good early warning system.'

FT  16 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Seeking healthy advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Such is the complexity of Britain's health and safety legislation that
companies frequently turn to consultants for advice and training. But how do
they decide whether a consultant is really necessary, choose the right one
and make sure they get value for money? A leaflet* from the Health &amp; Safety
Executive provides the answers to these and other questions. Recent
experience indicates some consultants do not understand the relevant
regulations well enough and lead employers into unnecessary expense, the HSE
warns.
Other consultants, meanwhile, appear deliberately to misinterpret the
legislation to promote their own services.
If a business is not too large and the risks are relatively clear it may
find the solutions in HSE booklets, by having an employee trained or by
speaking to its trade association.
A consultant may prove of value if the company is adopting new or
complicated technology or if it requires specialist skills for only a short
period.
When it comes to choosing a consultancy, a company should define its
requirements. It should describe the problem and why it cannot be dealt with
in-house; detail what it wants the consultant to do; and describe what it
would consider as a successful outcome.
That should be developed into a brief, which should outline a budget, set a
timeframe and describe what resources the company can offer. The client
should judge performance by assessing whether the consultant asked searching
questions, his recommendations were understandable and the company can act
upon them.
The booklet contains a list of useful addresses (though curiously no
telephone numbers) of specialist organisations that can provide further
advice.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Staying in the family -
Charles Batchelor discovers that some of the world's oldest corporate
dynasties thrive on diversification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not underestimate the staying power of the family business. After a
decade when the rise of the corporate financier and the insolvency
specialist appeared to mark the end of corporate longevity, the
old-established family company still has its place.
A French-based association of international, family-run businesses claims
one Japanese member going back as far as 718 while it counts another three
members dating from the 14th and 15th centuries.
The Henokians,* named after a Biblical patriarch who reputedly lived to the
age of 365, has more than two dozen members over 200 years old. The
association requires members to be majority-owned and managed by the
founder's descendants and to be financially sound.
Established in 1981 by descendants of the founders of Marie Brizard &amp; Roger
International, a French manufacturer of spirits and fruit brandies, the
Henokians have 11 members from Italy, eight from France, two each from Spain
and Japan and one each from Germany and Norway. Asprey, the British
manufacturer of luxury goods, was a member but lapsed when its character
changed as it expanded.
What are the common characteristics of member companies? The main one, in
the view of Dimitry Limont, association secretary, is a strong sense of
family history. This means employing professional, non-family managers when
necessary, and excluding incompetent family members, to ensure the business
flourishes but ultimate control stays with the founding dynasty.
A striking characteristic of members is the dominance of traditional sectors
such as wines and spirits and textiles. Metal working and packaging account
for a significant minority, while jewellers, glass makers and printers are
also represented. These sectors may be traditional but the companies have
adapted to technological and market change. Confetti Mario Pelino, an
Italian confectioner, is proud of its hand-made traditions which require
four days to glaze its sweets. Nevertheless, it is modernising production
and franchising the Pelino name outside Italy.
Viellard Migeon, a French iron foundry established in 1679, diversified out
of chains, bolts and screws into fish hooks at the beginning of this century
and claims to rank second in this sector in the world.
The oldest member of the association is the Hoshi Hotel, which claims to be
the oldest ryokan, or traditional inn, in Japan. Founded on the site of a
hot water spring by a Buddhist priest, Hoshi has expanded to a 100-room
hotel owned and managed, if oral tradition is to be believed, by the 46th
generation of the founding family. It was another 919 years until the
establishment of the second Japanese member, Gekkeikan Sake Company. This
relative newcomer was established as recently as 1637. Gekkeikan has
concentrated on improving methods of producing sake while other Henokians
have sought growth through diversification. Friedr. Schwarze (1664) claims
to run the largest Coca Cola bottling line in Germany alongside its
traditional business of producing corn spirit.
The predominance of Italian and French companies may reflect the relatively
underdeveloped capital markets in those countries and the economic weight of
the family-owned business, but the Henokians are seeking to broaden their
membership. The annual subscription of FFr24,000-FFr42,000 (Pounds
3,000-Pounds 5,250) may however, deter some smaller family firms.
The Henokians meet annually to discuss issues affecting the family company
and have links with organisations such as the Tercentenarians' Club**, a UK
group of 300-year-old companies. British family businesses such as R.
Durtnell &amp; Sons, a Kent building company founded in 1591, and Folkes Group
(1699), a Stourbridge-based open-die forging company, would probably qualify
for membership. In the UK, at least, the significance of family companies
has been largely ignored, although the Confederation of British Industry and
Stoy Hayward, an accountancy firm, have established a family business forum.
The compilation last year of a register*** of the largest 50,000 UK
companies by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, revealed 258
companies, many still family-owned, which were over 200 years old. Further
research is needed to show whether the corporate old-timers are an appealing
curiosity or whether they have a message for students of business
management.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Bulletins set to battle price rises: How the Bank and
Treasury promote policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England and the Treasury today wheel out the heavy artillery in
their joint battle to convince the financial markets that the government
will not take risks with inflation by cutting interest rates further.
The Bank's 32-page inflation report - to be released as part of its
quarterly bulletin giving an overall assessment of economic conditions and
monetary statistics - is one of a number of measures designed by Mr Norman
Lamont to bolster confidence in economic policy after sterling's exit from
the European exchange rate mechanism last September.
At the heart of the discussion about monetary policy is the relationship
between officials at the Treasury and the Bank. While the chancellor and his
officials have the last word on interest rates, they rely on the Bank for
advice, particularly about trends in currency markets.
The report has been drawn up by a team of Bank officials headed by Mr Mervyn
King, economics director, as well as Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the
Bank, who takes over as governor in July.
As with all the Bank's official policy documents, the report has been given
to Treasury officials for comment. Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief
economic adviser, and Mr Robert Culpin, the Treasury's most senior official
in charge of monetary affairs, have cast an eye over the details.
At the end of last week the report was ready for publication, although
neither the Bank or the Treasury was willing to say whether the Bank had
changed its draft as a result of Treasury remarks.
Not everyone in the City is convinced that the reports will be an
unadulterated view of how the Bank sees the inflation possibilities ahead.
In the past, the Treasury has often requested changes in Bank bulletins to
ensure they say nothing to conflict with the Treasury's own assessment of
economic conditions. 'You'd be surprised at the time it has sometimes taken
to resolve some of the arguments,' said a former senior Bank official.
Until now, the Treasury - as the department having the final say on economic
policymaking - has had the last word on any disputes about phrasing of the
bulletins.
The Bank insists that the procedure on the inflation reports will be
different. It will take into account anything the Treasury has to say, but
is much less likely than with the bulletins to change wording.
A Bank official said: 'We've been given a clear responsibility by Mr Lamont
to report on inflation and our repu-tation is on the line.'
Sir Douglas Wass, permanent secretary at the Treasury between 1974 and 1982,
now chairman of the European arm of the Japanese securities house Nomura,
said even if the Bank thought inflation was going to take off it would be
unlikely to say so for fear of upsetting markets.
'I look forward to reading the Bank's views on this subject but in the end I
think they will say much the same as the Treasury but in a different
language,' said Sir Douglas.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank, said: 'The facts are that
the officials involved with the inflation report have worked together under
all the old arrangements (of consultations over official documents). These
institutions aren't going to change their ways just because the chancellor
has asked the Bank to produce a new sort of report. I'm not expecting very
much.'

FT  16 FEB 93 / Council may appeal on High Court swaps ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISLINGTON council in north London is considering appealing against last
week's High Court ruling that it should repay more than Pounds 1m to
Westdeutsche Landesbank.
The ruling came in the first test case to reach court since the House of
Lords said two years ago that local authorities had no power to enter
interest-rate swap agreements.
The Lords' decision left 80 banks facing losses of Pounds 560m, some of
which they are seeking to recover through restitution - reclaiming the
interest paid to councils under the invalid swap agreements.
Islington is involved in a number of transactions, and could face problems
in repaying the substantial sums it would owe if the principle of
restitution were applied to other agreements.
Because Islington frequently acted as a third party - dealing with other
local authorities rather than directly with banks - it is difficult to form
a clear picture of its involvement, but bankers estimate it could owe more
than Pounds 10m.
The ruling means the council owes WestLB about Pounds 2m in principal and
interest. Islington is also the third party in a case between Morgan
Grenfell, the merchant bank, and Welwyn and Hatfield council, Hertfordshire,
which is due to come to court in April. Islington accounts for most of the
Pounds 2.2m in principal sought by Morgan Grenfell. Islington council
officials declined to comment on the sums involved.
Other councils used swaps to hedge interest-rate exposure, but Islington in
effect used the swaps market to raise money without breaching its borrowing
limits.
Bankers said the council was involved in 'deep-discount' swaps, in which
banks made potential interest payments up-front. This has increased the
amount of restitution banks can now seek from Islington.
Other councils, such as Hammersmith and Fulham, west London, were more
heavily exposed, but some put aside money to repay swaps, or have since made
provisions against potential claims.
Islington would not comment on whether it had made provisions. The council
needs to cut its 1993-94 budget of Pounds 220m by Pounds 8m to avoid
capping. Cost-cutting measures are due to be decided next month.
From a legal point of view, the banks involved welcomed Friday's ruling as
it has established that restitution is an appropriate path for them to
pursue.
Mr Konstantin Graf von Schweinitz, head of derivatives at Kleinwort Benson,
said the ruling 'confirms the validity of pursuing restitutional claims,
which councils at one stage disputed'.
The High Court also heard points of law concerning a dispute between
Kleinwort Benson and Sandwell council in the West Midlands, and ruled that
restitution could be applied to swap agreements which had already been
closed.
The next test case is due go to the High Court on Monday. Kleinwort Benson
is seeking restitution of Pounds 1.6m of payments made to South Tyneside.
If Islington does decide to appeal, the pace of out-of-court settlements
between banks and local councils, which would otherwise be expected to speed
up as a result of Friday's ruling, could subside until the process is
completed. Interest continues to accumulate during the appeal process, which
could last another year.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Private training for RAF pilots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAF and the Royal Navy are to hand over responsibility for initial pilot
training to the private-sector Hunting group, under a contract announced
yesterday.
Hunting won against seven other bidders, including British Aerospace. The
contract, for five years with an option for a further five, is expected to
be worth more than Pounds 20m over the full period.
The company will own and operate trainer aircraft at Topcliffe, near Thirsk
in North Yorkshire.
The privately operated joint squadron will handle all student pilots for the
two services, other than those who come through university air squadrons.
This will involve about 130 students a year.
Hunting will provide a fleet of about 20 T-67M Mark II Firefly aircraft,
made by the Yorkshire company Slingsby Aviation, which will replace Chipmunk
and Bulldog trainers.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Inflation changes forecast by Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRUCTURE of inflation in Britain is expected to change after sterling's
departure from the European exchange rate mechanism, with the gap between
goods and service inflation narrowing, the Bank of England said yesterday.
In an article released in advance of publication of its quarterly bulletin
today, the Bank said that annual retail price inflation was about 3
percentage points higher in the service sector than in the goods sector last
year - during most of which the UK was still in the ERM - after being about
2 percentage points higher on average since the early 1980s.
Yesterday's article said that the gap was partly explained by faster
productivity growth in manufacturing and the recession having a bigger
impact in suppressing goods inflation.
The Bank said foreign competition had combined with membership of the ERM to
restrain traded-goods inflation, and the ERM had 'led to an exchange rate
higher than it would otherwise have been'.
The report concluded that the gap between service and traded goods price
trends will narrow.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Improvement seen in retail sales figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RETAIL SALES in January recorded their first year-on-year growth since
September and their strongest annual increase since May last year, according
to a Confederation of British Industry survey released today.
The survey, carried out between January 18 and February 3, will revive hopes
of growing consumer demand after last month's disappointing official retail
sales data, which showed a drop in retail sales volumes between November and
December.
Although the CBI figures showed that sales were still below normal
expectations for the time of year, motor traders, wholesalers, grocers,
chemists and clothing retailers all reported rising sales volumes, according
to the CBI's monthly survey of distributive trades.
The survey, covering 277 retail organisations, found that 43 per cent
reported an increase in sales compared with a year ago. A decline was
disclosed by 32 per cent and 25 per cent said sales were unchanged.
The balance, which the CBI said indicated the trend, was a positive 11
percentage points, compared with a negative balance of 4 percentage points
in December and plus 21 points in January last year.
Retailers expect sales to be slightly higher in February, with a positive
balance of 5 per cent expecting an increase compared with the same month
last year.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, was
cautiously optimistic: 'Over the coming months, the interest-rate reductions
seen since September will be filtering through to homeowners' pockets and
this should help lift consumer confidence,' he said.
Mr Whittaker warned that recovery remained fragile, however. He said: 'Given
the levels of consumer debt and the continuing rise in unemployment, it is
too early to be sure we are seeing a sustainable recovery in consumer
spending. The survey indicated that sales volumes still remain below what
retailers would consider normal.
The pattern of sales was mixed across the retail sector. Although chemists,
grocers and clothing retailers saw rising sale volumes - partly because of
consumers putting off their purchases until the post-Christmas sales -
off-licences, furniture and carpet retailers, confectionery, tobacco and
newspaper outlets saw sale falls.
The most buoyant sector in the distributive trades was the motor trade,
where the number of companies reporting higher sales exceeded those
reporting declines by 20 percentage points, the highest positive balance
since January 1989.
Motor traders are also more optimistic about trading conditions this month
with a positive balance of 31 per cent predicting higher sales. Sales of
both vehicles and parts grew strongly in January and are expected to be
higher this month than a year ago.
In the wholesale sector, traders reported moderately increased sales in
January and expectations of improved trading this month. Indicative of
overall caution, the volume of orders placed with suppliers by companies in
all three sectors of the distributive trades was lower last month than in
January last year.
Both the retail and wholesale sectors reported continued high stock levels
last month but motor traders said their stocks were now less than adequate
to meet expected demand. The CBI said, however, that motor traders intended
to cut orders.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Brokers and dealers profit from currency turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism and the UK's
deteriorating fiscal position have boosted the profits of brokers and
dealers in the City in recent months, according to figures released
yesterday.
Gilt-edged marketmakers - the band of specialists who deal in UK government
debt - made record profits last year while brokers and dealers in the equity
market bounced back into profit by the end of the year, after experiencing
their worst losses for nearly three years.
According to an article in the latest Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, to
be published today, gilts marketmakers made post-tax profits of Pounds 65m
between them last year, their best results since the Big Bang reforms which
reshaped the market in 1986.
This was up from Pounds 49m in 1991, although the profits are still dwarfed
by the Pounds 190m losses that gilts specialists incurred in 1988 and 1989.
The government's heavy borrowing has helped to breath life back into the
market, which seemed doomed to be quiet backwater of the financial markets
as the UK started to pay off its public debt in the 1980s. Trading in gilts
jumped last year to Pounds 4.9bn a day, up from Pounds 4.4bn a day in 1991.
Some houses are also thought to have made good trading profits from two
rallies in the gilt market - one prompted by the Conservatives' election
victory in April and the other by sterling's departure from the ERM on
September 16.
These were balanced by the reversal in the market in the early summer, when
Danish voters refused to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of the UK clearing bank, is
thought to have performed strongly again last year, having been the most
profitable gilts house in 1991 with Pounds 25.7m. Greenwell, owned by
Hongkong Bank and another leading gilt firms, is also thought to have done
well, after seeing its profits slip to Pounds 3.5m the year before.
The gilt marketmakers' new year got off to a bad start, however, with losses
estimated at Pounds 20m to Pounds 25m during a gilt auction in January. UK
interest rates were cut the day before the auction, driving up gilt prices.
This hit marketmakers, who had left themselves short of bonds in
anticipation of buying stock in the auction.
Meanwhile, members of London Stock Exchange are estimated to have made
Pounds 24m in the final three months of last year - a poor return on their
Pounds 4.5bn of capital, but a sharp improvement after pre-tax losses of
Pounds 126m in the previous quarter.
The flow of rights issues so far this year and continuing buoyancy in the
equity market means that profits are likely to rise further.
A sharp decline in broker income in the third quarter accounted for the
losses at that stage. Total income fell from more than Pounds 1bn in the
previous quarter to just Pounds 739m.
The boost to the stock market as sterling fell out of the ERM reversed this,
with trading volumes jumping from a lull during the summer.
The head of equities at one large bank in London said: 'It's self-evident
that things have got dramatically better. The question now is whether they
continue to get better, or whether people start bidding up salaries again.'
In spite the improvement in profits, City firms continue to make a poor
return on capital. Gilts houses made a return of 15 per cent on the Pounds
432m capital they had at the start of the year - by the end, it had risen to
Pounds 532m. Members of the Stock Exchange are estimated to have made Pounds
30m for the year as a whole, on a capital base of Pounds 4.5bn - a return of
less than 1 per cent.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Inflation gap between sectors expected to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRUCTURE of inflation in Britain is expected to change in the future
after sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism with
the gap between goods and service inflation narrowing, the Bank of England
said yesterday.
In an article released in advance of publication of its quarterly bulletin
today, the Bank said annual retail price inflation was about 3 percentage
points higher in the service sector than in the goods sector last year after
being about 2 percentage points higher on average since the early 1980s.
Divergence in the components of inflation has been a matter of concern at
the Bank in the past.
Yesterday's article said that faster productivity growth in manufacturing
explained much of the gap.
A further explanation might be that the recession had had a bigger impact in
suppressing goods' inflation.
The Bank said the gap had followed a regular pattern through the 1980s,
peaking about every two years. It had often been at its largest when
sterling's real exchange rate was at its peak, as in 1980-81, 1988 and
1991-92.
After studying the period between 1989 and the present, it concluded that
foreign competition, combined with British membership of the European
exchange rate mechanism had exercised a powerful restraint on traded-goods
inflation.
The Bank said the ERM restrained price rises 'in so far as it led to an
exchange rate higher than it would otherwise have been'.
By causing price setters to expect a fixed exchange rate, the ERM may also
have encouraged them to set prices lower than they otherwise would have
done.
Price increases of 5 per cent to 10 per cent across a range of food products
were predicted yesterday by the chairman of Dalgety, which supplies the
start of the food chain through animal feed and flour.
Mr Maurice Warren said post-devaluation increases in raw material costs were
being passed on to farmers and food manufacturers.
'We supply the start of the chain with animal feed,' he said. Price
increases of 15 per cent to 20 per cent had been pushed through since last
October. Animal feed was particularly vulnerable because raw materials
accounted for 80 per cent of production costs.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shadow cabinet weighs policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE shadow cabinet emerged last night from a day-long strategy session, held
amid continuing internal criticism of the party leadership, having agreed to
launch fresh consultations on industrial, education and health policies.
Mr John Smith, Labour's leader, said he wanted colleagues to flesh out
policies based principles he set out earlier this month - the fostering of
individual aspirations and attacking long-established party 'shibboleths'.
But Mr Bryan Gould, who challenged Mr Smith for the leadership last year,
said on BBC Radio that there was a 'vacuum' in the Labour movement needing
to be filled, 'not with vague aspirations but with real, hard policies'.
Further economic policy details will be set out tomorrow by Mr Gordon Brown,
shadow chancellor. Yesterday he hinted that Labour would not set full
employment as a target but wanted to end mass joblessness.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, is to hold discussions
with industry and commerce with the aim of forging what a Labour spokesman
described as a 'consensual' industrial policy. Similar exercises will be
conducted by Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, and Mr David
Blunkett, the shadow health secretary.
Industry, education and health policy are expected to be policy areas
debated at the party's 1994 conference - with Europe and the constitution
debated this year.
Mr Smith said Labour policies needed to satisfy three criteria - they would
have to be radical, practical and popular. He shrugged of criticism of his
leadership style and said: 'It is not enough for the Labour party to be an
effective opposition. Day after day, we have to set out our constructive
alternatives for the day when we become the government.'

FT  16 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory Euro-rebels divided on tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT back-tracking over Maastricht last night left Euro-sceptic Tory
MPs divided over tactics towards Labour's social chapter amendment  - but
elated at the embarrasment caused to ministers.
Mr James Cran, Tory MP for Beverley and prominent Maastricht opponent, said
the Euro-sceptics would be seeking their own legal advice. 'We are reserving
our position,' he said.
The humiliation, however, may have been worthwhile from the government's
viewpoint with several Conservative Euro-sceptics indicating that the
threatened rebellion would evaporate now Labour's amendment was seen as
meaningless.
But others believed that there was still value in embarrassing the
government and a faint prospect it could prevent Maastricht being
implemented.
Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, said he still intended to vote
for Labour's amendment to save money for Britain.
Labour believes its amendment 27, removing the protocol on the social
chapter and Britain's 'opt out', would force the government to incorporate
the social chapter. Last night Mr John Smith, party leader, said the
amendment would not be withdrawn and accused the government of 'a serious
contempt of the parliamentary process'.
Attention of Euro-sceptics is likely to turn to other possibilities for
wrecking the bill - perhaps via fresh amendments on the social chapter, or a
referendum. 'It is business as usual. We are going to continue to seek
amendments to this bill and put pressure on in the House of Commons,' said
Mr Cran.
Lord Tebbit, former Tory chairman, said on Channel Four news: 'We may still
find ways of tripping it up and destroying it'.
Other Euro-sceptics believe that the fresh confusion justifies the use of
delaying tactics and reinforces the argument for a referendum.
In the Commons, opposition MPs and Tory Euro-sceptics reacted to Mr Hurd's
performance with undisguised hilarity, commenting repeatedly on the
'convenience' of the new legal interpretation from the government's
perspective.
The mood was encapsulated by Sir Russell Johnston, Liberal Democrat foreign
affairs spokesman, who provoked laughter by asking whether the 'simple'
point was not 'where there is a political will, there is a legal way.'
Among Euro-sceptics, Mr William Cash, MP for Stafford, claimed the reason
for 'all this confusion, chaos and mess' was that the Maastricht treaty was
'riddled with contradictions.' He called for the document to be consigned to
'the dustbin of history.'
Mr Richard Shepherd, MP for Aldridge-Brownhills, asked how MPs could rely on
any of the legal advice communicated by the government.

FT  16 FEB 93 / 'Thank God - thank you all'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLEARLY relieved Mr Thomas Ward left the Old Bailey yesterday, acquitted
of the single charge of stealing Pounds 5.2m from Guinness, John Mason
writes.
'Thank God - thank you all,' he had said from the dock to the jury after it
had delivered its verdict.
Mr Ward remained unrepentant about his role in the infamous takeover of
Distillers. He told reporters: 'Not one Guinness shareholder and not one
Guinness director came here and suggested I did anything wrong.
'I regret what has happened, but I don't regret the contributions I made to
Guinness. I regret the fact that a number of good people have been hurt by a
totally misplaced prosecution.'
He then signalled his intention to return to practise as a commercial
attorney in Washington DC.
'I continue to practise law. It has not always been easy, but I have had
great clients throughout this. I will continue to win cases for them and
solve their problems.
'I will continue to consult with international businesses in creating more
good companies for shareholders - which we did in this case and we were very
proud of.'
His solicitor, Mr Harvey Rands of Memery Crystal, criticised the prosecution
for alleging criminality instead of non-compliance with regulatory
requirements and business standards.
'Mr Ward was never an appropriate candidate for regulatory censure - as a
foreigner he was entitled to and did rely on the local professionals and
practitioners,' he said.
'Who were the victims? Not Guinness or Distillers shareholders, whose
fortunes have quadrupled at the highest point on the market.
'It seems that Britain's capacity to regulate and understand its own
marketplace has taken the biggest knock, followed closely behind by the
public purse, that has carried the cost of a misconceived prosecution.'

FT  16 FEB 93 / Men for whom Guinness proved a poisoned chalice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END of the final Guinness trial leaves the seven men charged earlier in
the case to get on with rebuilding their personal and professional lives.
Some have returned to prominence in the City, others may never recover from
the impact of the charges on their careers.
Mr Ernest Saunders was convicted in the first trial on 12 counts of theft,
false accounting and conspiracy, and sentenced to five years in jail, later
reduced to 2 1/2 years by the Court of Appeal. He was released after serving
10 months.
Since his release from Ford open prison, Mr Saunders has acted as an
independent business consultant. Fiercely critical of the roles played by
his prosecutors and the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Saunders has
lectured on the problems facing businessmen whose conduct comes under
question, and given evidence to legal bodies.
He is preparing to launch a legal action in the European Court, in effect
asking for a judicial review of the roles of the DTI, SFO and other legal
processes brought against those accused of serious fraud.
Mr Roger Seelig, a former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell,
yesterday condemned the system which disrupted his life: 'What must be
fundamentally wrong is the length of time it has taken to bring it all to a
conclusion. To take seven years over a regulatory matter of this instance
may have been politically necessary at the time, but it cannot be a sensible
way of tackling it.'
His trial on fraud and false accounting charges was abandoned after he broke
down due to the stress of conducting his own defence. Further charges were
dropped.
Mr Seelig has not made a public return to the City, although he has been
involved in consultancy work. He was yesterday appointed a director of
Norman Hay, a small engineering company, and said he hoped to return to the
City in a professional capacity shortly.
Charges of fraud and false accounting against Lord Spens, a former corporate
financier at merchant bankers Henry Ansbacher, were initially left on the
file after the collapse of the trial due to Mr Seelig's ill-health. After a
long High Court battle, Lord Spens secured his acquittal, although this has
yet to be formally granted.
Lord Spens has yet to make a comeback to the City since he is presently
dealing with fall-out from the Guinness affair. He is trying to win back
legal costs in excess of Pounds 300,000 and has issued writs against the
Bank of England and Henry Ansbacher relating to his dismissal from the Bank.
He is also preparing a paper on long fraud trials to be submitted to the
Lord Chancellor's Department. It will contain 'very hard hitting' criticisms
of his prosecutors, he promises.
Mr Gerald Ronson, founder and chairman of the Heron group, was fined Pounds
5m and served six months of a one-year jail sentence at Ford open prison,
after being convicted on theft, false accounting and conspiracy charges.
After his release, Mr Ronson returned to the helm of Heron, but the company
was suffering serious financial problems. He is negotiating with banks over
restructuring Heron's Pounds 1.4bn debts.
Mr David Mayhew, a partner at Cazenove, the stockbrokers, is the only
Guinness defendant whose career was not interrupted by the affair. He was
arrested in 1988 on charges relating to the purchase of shares in Distillers
by Pipetec, a Swiss company, but his employers were convinced of his
innocence. By permission of the Securities and Futures Authority he was able
to continue working at Cazenove's, under the supervision of colleagues,
while charges were outstanding against him.
The charges were dropped in February 1992, before the case came to court. Mr
Mayhew remains a powerful figure in corporate finance, as head of Cazenove's
syndicate department.
Mr Anthony Parnes was convicted on four counts of theft and false
accounting, and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in jail, reduced to 21 months by
the Court of Appeal. He was released after serving 11 months, but has found
it impossible to find his way back into the City. Following his conviction
the Securities and Futures Authority has refused to relicense him to engage
in any stockbroking work.
Mr Jack Lyons was fined Pounds 3m after being convicted on six counts of
conspiracy, false accounting, and theft. Sentencing him, the judge said only
his ill-health had saved the financier from a prison sentence. He was
stripped of his knighthood.
Still suffering from illness, Mr Lyons has retired from his business career
and is now living in Switzerland.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Not guilty verdict brings down curtain on City epic:
Acquittal of Thomas Ward in final Guinness trial deals blow to Serious Fraud
Office strategy - Prosecution criticised as 'misplaced'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTROOM eight at the Old Bailey was virtually empty at 4.50 yesterday
afternoon as the curtain finally came down on the Guinness affair.
Seven years before, a blaze of publicity greeted the drinks group's purchase
of Distillers for Pounds 2.6m - the largest ever UK takeover. The first
criminal trial that followed was dubbed the 'City trial of the century'.
Yesterday Mr Thomas Ward, the last man involved in the saga to stand trial,
was barely noticed as he picked his way around a cleaner mopping the
courtroom steps before walking out on to the streets to face a handful of
photographers.
The not guilty verdict ended the City's longest brush with the criminal
justice system, a six-year epic which started in high drama but was to tail
off into disarray.
The jailing in 1990 of two prominent business figures - Mr Ernest Saunders
and Mr Gerald Ronson - shook the financial world to its foundation. A third
man, stockbroker Mr Anthony Parnes, was also jailed, while the businessman
Sir Jack Lyons was fined Pounds 3m.
For the fledgling Serious Fraud Office it seemed to vindicate the most
ambitious attempt ever made to prosecute malpractice in the financial
markets. For the first time a jury was asked to understand and pass judgment
on a highly complex case which even financial experts would have had trouble
following.
But from that high point the prosecutions arising from the Distillers
takeover quickly tumbled into farce, culminating in the final reversal for
the SFO yesterday.
Like a movie producer failing to live up to a glittering triumph, the
Guinness prosecutors attempted a string of sequels which never matched the
success of the original. Guinness Two saw Mr Roger Seelig, one of the stars
of the takeover boom of the 1980s, fight himself into a state of mental and
physical exhaustion while conducting his own defence. The trial was called
off and his co-defendant, Lord Spens, later acquitted.
Guinness Three never saw the light of day as charges against Mr David
Mayhew, another prominent takeover adviser, were dropped. But that did not
stop Guinness Four, the ultimately unsuccessful prosecution of Ward.
The case has hung over the SFO since its creation in 1987, and has helped
shape the way important fraud trials are prosecuted. Early on the SFO
appeared to adopt a scatter-gun approach, firing a range of charges at
defendants in the hope that at least some of them would stick. The four
defendants in the first trial faced 24 charges between them, whittled down
from a longer list.
By the end of the Guinness saga the scatter-gun had become a single
rifle-shot. Mr Ward faced one charge of theft, in part a reflection of the
desire of prosecutors and judges to reduce the length of fraud trials and to
present juries with a simpler case. Yesterday's verdict shows that this
strategy carries no guarantee of success.
Coming at the same time as the long-running Blue Arrow trial, the Guinness
case has also had a profound effect on attitudes to the conduct of fraud
trials. The judge in the first two trials, Mr Justice Henry, was moved to go
public with a series of radical suggestions for reform. Many of these have
now been officially sanctioned in a consultative paper produced by the Lord
Chancellor's Department. The judge's suggestions included introducing time
limits to trials and earlier disclosure of defendants' cases. The judge in
the Ward trial will make his feelings known today.
For the City, the Guinness affair is a trauma safely left to historians. One
City lawyer said: 'To most people, the Guinness saga ended when Ernest
Saunders went to jail. It remains a warning against gung-ho behaviour, but
people have long since moved on.'
Nevertheless, the saga has left its imprint on the way business is conducted
in the financial markets. The Guinness case brought home for the first time
the fact that leading financial advisers employed by the City's most
respected houses could be hauled into the dock. Whatever the final outcome
in terms of convictions, this has helped to change attitudes about the
conduct of takeovers. With the takeover market in a prolonged lull, however,
it is impossible to tell how immediately effective the lesson.
Guinness itself has long since put the affair behind it. It was forced by
the Takeover Panel to pay Pounds 85m to former Distillers shareholders who
were judged to have been misled, and agreed a Pounds 92m settlement with
Argyll, the rival group that it pipped to the post in the Distillers
takeover. Since then sweeping management changes have restored the group's
reputation and the company has built on the Distillers takeover to transform
itself from a medium-ranked brewer and ragtail retailer into the most
profitable drinks group in the world.
With the benefits of the Distillers restructuring, pre-tax profits between
1987 and 1991 soared from Pounds 408m to Pounds 956m, while earnings per
share grew from 14.7p to 33.6p and dividends rose from 4.6p to 10.8p.
When Sir Anthony Tennant, brought in to replace Mr Saunders as chief
executive, finally retired last year, he left behind an entirely different
company from the demoralised and scandal-torn one he had inherited.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mackay suggests press ombudsman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRESS ombudsman with the power to award compensation for libel was
suggested yesterday by Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, as a means of
improving access to justice for ordinary people in defamation cases.
The lord chancellor told the Commons national heritage committee inquiry
into privacy and media intrusion, that there was no realistic possibility of
extending legal aid to cover defamation cases in the immediate future.
'This is not a good time for that. I am already looking at ways of
containing the scope of the legal aid budget. Circumstances are not
auspicious for opening up legal aid,' he told the MPs.
In line with that, Lord Mackay said he was keen to encourage systems for
dealing with disputes which did not require going to court.
A press ombudsman or a number of press ombudsmen could provide a simpler,
cheaper, quicker and more informal way of dealing with defamation claims.
Lord Mackay said he envisaged the ombudsman having the power to award
compensation and being obliged to publish his findings.
Those who used the ombudsman system would not necessarily have to waive
their rights to pursue an action through the courts but safeguards would
have to be built in to ensure people did not use the ombudsman system as a
means of testing the strength of their case before litigating.
Limiting the ombudsman's powers to order redress would be a way of
encouraging only those interested in a quick and speedy resolution of their
dispute to use the ombudsman system.
Lord Mackay also said he was prepared to consider extending the 'no-win,
no-fee' conditional fee system to defamation cases. He proposed to allow
conditional fee arrangements in personal injury cases this year and would
consider extending it to libel actions.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Straightforward case adds few fresh insights into takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRIAL of Mr Thomas Ward was, by comparison with its forerunners, a
relatively pedestrian affair.
With no reference to the share support operation mounted by Guinness to see
off the rival bid by Argyll, the case against Mr Ward was a straightforward
one of theft.
The jury heard nothing about indemnities and, with the exception of Mr
Saunders, little or no mention was made of the starring characters from the
first Guinness trial.
Figures such as Tony Parnes, Jack Lyons and Gerald Ronson, and institutions
such as Bank Leu, which played a significant role in the exercise of ramping
the share price in the final stages of the bid, were rarely, if ever,
mentioned.
Most of the court time was spent in detailed argument over the invoice
submitted by Mr Ward to Guinness for the disputed Pounds 5.2m.
With characters such as Mr Olivier Roux, the former Guinness finance
director, giving evidence for the third time, no new insights were gained
into the infamous takeover.
However, the entire character of the trial changed when, in a genuinely
dramatic episode, Mr Ward was alleged to have fabricated evidence to support
his case.
Having taken the risk of going into the witness box, he told the court how,
contrary to what had been been previously thought, documentary evidence did
exist to show the Pounds 3m he had placed in Mr Saunders's Swiss bank
account always belonged to him rather than to the Guinness chief executive.
The development visibly stopped the prosecution in their tracks. The
document - a note written by Mr Ward to his brother - was passed by defence
lawyers to the prosecution for the first time.
The two policemen left on the case, by then involved in little except
routine administration for the trial, were faced with genuine detective work
to perform against a tight deadline.
The note, detailing bank accounts in which Mr Ward had an interest, was
supposedly written in August 1986. However, one of the accounts mentioned in
the note - one not connected with the Guinness deal in any way - had not
been opened until four months later.
A Washington bank official was hurriedly flown over in Concorde to confirm
details of when the account was opened.
The authenticity of the note was not resolved during the trial. Mr Ward,
recalled to the witness box, strongly denied the allegation that he had
fabricated it.
The episode provided the only real excitement during the five-week trial.
However, the hopes of the Serious Fraud Office that it had found conclusive
proof of dishonesty were to be dashed by the jury's verdict.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell probe on hold again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE investigation by the Commons social security committee into the theft of
funds from Maxwell company pension schemes was put on hold yesterday for a
second time, Alison Smith writes.
MPs on the cross-party committee cancelled a session today in which they
were due to take evidence from Lord Rippon and from Mr Basil Brookes, former
Maxwell Communication Corporation finance director.
Instead, they will meet solely for their first full discussion of the
request from the Serious Fraud Office to halt public hearings because many
of those to be called are material witnesses in forthcoming trials. The
SFO's request, late last month, led to a delay in the original plans for
questioning Mr Brookes.
Committee members are roughly evenly divided as to whether they should carry
on with the inquiry, taking evidence in private, or whether their work would
be so hampered that they should abandon it for the time being.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Production hopes rise at Daf plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS and trade unions at the Leyland Daf van plant in Birmingham
indicated last night that at least one main component supplier had declared
its willingness to resume deliveries, opening the way to resumed limited
production later this week.
It was also confirmed that accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand would advise a
group of the Birmingham plant's managers seeking to launch a buy-out bid.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand said the management team, led by managing director Mr
Allen Amery, had started to develop a business strategy. Coopers' initial
task will be to help produce a 'robust' plan and secure the necessary
investment for the buy-out to proceed.
Mr Ken Ogilvie, the Coopers partner responsible for the project, said 'we
believe the Allen Amey management team is in a strong position to secure the
future of the plant', which employs nearly 1,400 people at the Washwood
Heath, Birmingham, factory.
Some of the company's biggest customers, including the Royal Mail and
Parcelforce, confirmed their intention not to cancel orders for vans while a
reasonable prospect of rescue remained.
National and local union officials also decided at a meeting in Birmingham
yesterday to back any management buy-out and to continue campaigning to keep
the plants open.
There was a narrow vote against industrial action. This followed a vote last
week at Leyland, Lancashire, that was heavily against a strike.
Production workers at the Albion factory in Glasgow have balloted in favour
of industrial action but will not go ahead with action. Mr John Carty,
Glasgow district secretary of the AEEU electrical and engineering union,
said: 'We are not going on strike. What was hoped was that other plants
would join us in a national type of action throughout Leyland Daf.'
Mr John Allen, AEEU chief negotiator, said after the Birmingham vote: 'We
have now got to get on with the job of saving the plant. We'll leave no
stone unturned in our endeavour to achieve this.'
Ownership of the intellectual property in Daf's operations in Lancashire may
be a factor in deciding whether the Netherlands company's UK truckmaking
businesses can be bought as a separate concern.
Leaders of Lancashire Enterprises, the privatised regeneration agency which
acts for Lancashire County Council, will meet Mr Cornelius Baan, chairman of
Daf's board of managers in Eindhoven today.
There is strong local interest in mounting a rescue package, probably
brokered by Lancashire Enterprises, which has venture capital funds of its
own and experience in syndicating big deals with other financial
institutions.
The right to use the ideas in design and production management being worked
on by the company's design department in Leyland would make the company more
attractive to a buyer.
Mr Jim Mason, chairman of Lancashire Enterprises, and Mrs Louise Ellman, his
vice-chairman and Labour leader of the county council, played a role in the
management buy-out of Leyland Bus six years ago, securing government and EC
help with a Pounds 1m retraining package.

YOUNG people on government-funded training programmes should be given a

In a message to managers the society said: 'Failing to treat youth trainees

damaging to them at the outset of their career. Undertaking to train a young
person for a year is a major commitment, getting it right is all-important

TALKS between management and unions at strikebound Yarrow Shipbuilders broke
up yesterday with neither side giving ground, Catherine Milton writes.
The talks took place at the request of Mr Murray Easton, managing director
and chief executive of the Clydeside warship yard. He asked union officials
for the opportunity to present the background to the company's wage offer
directly to the shop stewards, who have rejected it.
The company, which is facing its second week of an indefinite strike over
wages and changes to working practices, has offered a Pounds 300 lump sum
for the year to July followed by a 3.8 per cent rise for the following 12
months.
The company is seeking changes to working practices, including the abolition
of a Friday morning tea break. The 1,300 strikers want a substantial
increase on their basic weekly rate of Pounds 218 for a skilled worker.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Slim Home Office watches weight: Kenneth Clarke's efficiency
drive and how services are coming under increasing pressure from new ways to
save public money - Public spending review / Home Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN spending by government departments is presented in the familiar diagram
of a sliced-up pie, the Home Office appears as a slimmer's portion.
Its inclusion in the first phase of the Whitehall public spending review,
alongside far bigger-spending departments, no doubt partly reflects the fact
that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, is already trying to think the
unthinkable in his department and might welcome the review process to
concentrate minds.
It also sends a signal that even services as close to the heart of the state
as police, prisons and immigration are not immune from questioning and new
ideas.
When, in the mid 1980s, free-market think tanks started advancing the idea
of private prisons, it was treated as eccentric. Britain now has two
privately managed prisons and is likely to gain more soon. But will Mr
Clarke go further?
The government's approach is still cautious - prisons are privately managed
rather than privatised, remaining under Home Office ownership.
Ministers want the prison department, which becomes an agency operating the
Pounds 1.6bn a year service at arm's length from the government in April, to
develop performance-related pay and modernise prison management and
industrial relations. Introducing competition is as much about shaking up
the public sector as moving towards a privately run service.
But if private management proves successful the few voices in the
Conservative party that argue for all-out privatisation could be encouraged.
Few private companies would hope to gain in either profit or prestige from
owning some of Britain's appalling, Victorian prisons. But a Pounds 1bn
building programme is nearing completion and by the mid 1990s considerable
sections of the prison estate might attract the interest of private owners.
Mr Clarke will be able to show the review that when it comes to the police -
his other big spending area - the drive for better value for money is
already a top priority. For the past decade the police came top of the
league for public spending increases - the service consumes nearly Pounds
6bn a year in England and Wales and staff costs account for 80 per cent of
this.
'Civilianisation' - transferring administration, control and other tasks
from police officers to civilians - has saved Pounds 130m and there will be
more. Radio communications services will be privatised, with other support
activities likely to follow.
International experience does not suggest that hiving off entire areas of
police responsibility - perhaps establishing a separate traffic agency -
would increase cost-effectiveness or operational efficiency.
If the spending review produced a determined wave of new radicalism, might
the Home Office's array of responsibilities throw up any more 'impossible'
ideas - such as private prison management in the 1980s - that could come to
fruition in the 1990s?
The Adam Smith Institute has pointed to the fire service. The future
organisation of fire services - at present a Pounds 1.2bn a year function -
will have to be considered by ministers as part of their review of local
government. In the US a few localities have privately run fire brigades
operating under contract to public authorities.
The fire service will not necessarily remain immune from the government's
overall policy goal of turning local authorities into contract-awarding and
monitoring bodies rather than providers of services.
Eight companies bid to run Wolds remand centre on Humberside, the first
privately managed prison, even though the British private sector had no
previous expertise in prison management. At least as many would be likely to
show interest in fire services.
The service would also lend itself to local contract-bids from officers and
staff or even management buy-outs.
If the idea seems far-fetched it should be remembered that, in the early
1980s, almost no local authorities con-tracted out refuse-collection
services.
The most dramatic opportunity for the Home Office could involve the
voluntary sector, where the government is trying to encourage charities to
take over delivery of welfare and other services from statutory agencies.
The problem is that most voluntary organisations face even greater financial
pressures than the government.
Proposals to run a generic marketing campaign to increase individual and
corporate support for charity collapsed last month - because the Home Office
would not contribute Pounds 1.5m to the cost.
In this area the Home Office might have to tell Mr Michael Portillo - who
heads the review - that it will have to spend now to save later.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Peugeot Talbot workers to strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR WORKERS at Peugeot Talbot in Coventry have been called out on strike
from next Monday over pay and conditions, unions announced yesterday .
The 3,500 manual workers at the company's main production plant last week
rejected a two-year pay offer comprising a 3.5 per cent increase this year,
and the greater of a 3.5 per cent or inflation increase in 1994.
The workforce voted last week by 2,300 to 859 in favour of a strike, said
the TGWU general union, the main union involved. The strike announcement
followed the breakdown of talks with management, said union officials.
Mr Tony Woodley, TGWU national motor industry secretary and leader of the
Peugeot Talbot manual workers, said unions had been seeking a package which
included a guarantee of job security.
Negotiations had been complicated by company attempts to cut rest periods,
said Mr Woodley. Management confirmed it wanted to reduce paid 'relief' time
from 42 minutes a shift to 30 minutes - separate half-hour lunch breaks are
unpaid.
Mr Woodley said there had been a 30 per cent increase in productivity in
less than three years. 'We feel strongly that the time has come to reward
that contribution,' he added.
Peugeot Talbot said yesterday it did not want to comment on the threatened
strike and that no further talks with unions had been scheduled.

FT  16 FEB 93 / AEEU launches ballot campaign
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of 1m engineers and electricians yesterday launched a Pounds 250,000
campaign urging their members to vote in favour of affiliating with the
Trades Union Congress.
Next month's ballot by the AEEU will be the first time a big union has asked
its members to vote on the issue. The electricians were expelled in 1988
over an inter-union row. The engineers remained inside the TUC.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, AEEU executive council member for Scotland, where the AEEU
has about 80,000 members, predicted a yes vote north of the border, where
the members, including the electrical section, are already affiliated to the
STUC.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Asbestos removal 'risky and a waste of money'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIPPING asbestos out of schools and other public buildings is usually a
waste of money and can increase the risk to the public, a leading specialist
on asbestos-related disease warned yesterday.
Professor Julian Peto of the Institute of Cancer Research in London said
that asbestos exposure constituted a minor risk to the general public.
He said: 'The last 20 years have witnessed an extraordinary shift, from
neglect of a major industrial hazard to irrational exaggeration of a
negligible environmental pollutant.'
Prof Peto's comments will encourage those public health officials who
maintain that the best course of action - when asbestos is discovered in a
building or public place - is to paint over it and leave well alone.
Removing the material can liberate needle-shaped asbestos particles that
cause cancer if they get into the lungs.
The Health and Safety Executive - the public body responsible for protecting
workers from asbestos exposure - welcomed Prof Peto's remarks. 'We agree
with him,' said Dr Trevor Ogden of the executive. 'Asbestos materials that
are sound, undamaged and not releasing dust should not be disturbed.'
About 9,000 cases a year of asbestos removal are notified to the executive
ranging in scale from removing lagging from a pipe to dismantling a large
factory.
The Asbestos Removal Contractors' Association said 200 to 300 companies work
actively to remove the material in the UK, although 1,000 are licensed to do
so.
'I'm not going to argue with Julian Peto,' said a representative of the
contractors' association. 'There's no legislation which would force a
building owner to have the asbestos removed.'
There is no accurate estimate of total UK spending on asbestos removal,
although it probably exceeds Pounds 100m a year. Even a single case - such
as stripping the material from Linlithgow Academy near Edinburgh - can cost
more than Pounds 5m.
Asbestos is responsible for more occupational cancers than any other agent -
almost 1,000 deaths from mesothelioma (cancer of the lining of the lungs)
and more than 2,000 deaths from lung cancer each year in the UK.

<TEXT>
ALCATEL, the French telecommunications equipment group, has won contracts
worth Dollars 400m (Pounds 282m) in China through its Spanish and Norwegian
subsidiaries.
The contracts have been signed despite strained Sino-French trade relations
following the sale last year of 60 French Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters to
Taiwan.
Two months ago China ordered France to close a consulate in Guangzhou
province and then banned French companies from tendering for a Dollars 1bn
subway contract in the region.
Alcatel is the world's largest telecommunications equipment supplier and
part of the Alcatel-Alsthom industrial group.
The contracts involve Alcatel Standard Electrica, its Spanish subsidiary, in
two joint ventures with China. One will set up a plant in Chengdu, Sichuan,
to produce voice and data transmission equipment. The second, at Wuhan in
the Hubei region, will make equipment for telephone exchanges.
Alcatel Standard Electrica and Alcatel Telecom Norway, the Norwegian
subsidiary, have also won contracts to supply more than 2m lines of digital
switching in China during the mid-1990s.
The Alcatel group already has substantial interests in China, where it
supplies 40 per cent of all digital telephone switching equipment.

FT  16 FEB 93 / World Trade News: China leaps towards top 10 traders / A
look at the pressures accompanying rapid export growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA this year is expected to enter the 'top 10' of the world's trading
nations, leapfrogging Taiwan and South Korea in the process. But China's
extraordinary export growth is also bringing increased pressures for
liberalisation and improved access to its markets.
Sensitive to these pressures, emanating mainly from the US, whose trade
deficit with China in 1992 reached Dollars 18bn, Chinese officials have
promised to quicken the pace of reform. One of China's main aims is to
rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as soon as practicable,
perhaps this year.
The Chinese see early Gatt membership as one way of dealing with bilateral
pressures from its main trading partners - the US, Japan and Germany - all
of which are restive about their yawning trade gaps with China.
China's powerful Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade will be
monitoring trade signals from the new Clinton administration, expected to be
less tolerant of the imbalance than its predecessor. Congress has also
signalled a growing restiveness on the China trade issue.
An early indication of the state of China-US trade relations is likely to
come in the next few weeks when officials of the office of the Special Trade
Representative - the first high-level Clinton team to come to Beijing - sit
down to discuss Gatt-related issues.
The US officials are certain to press their Chinese counterparts to speed
liberalisation in line with the US-China market agreement reached last
October. Under this, Beijing agreed over the next few years to remove about
75 per cent of its non-tariff barriers on a global Most Favoured Nation
(MFN) basis.
US trade representatives are also reporting that China is making a special
effort to discuss new projects. After the lull that followed the 1989
Tiananmen episode, American businessmen have been returning to China with
'zest', according to a US official.
But the larger deals in the petrochemical, power and transport sectors will
take time to bring to fruition. In the meantime, the Chinese continue
rapidly to expand and improve the range and the quality of their exports.
Progress made by China in the past decade is impressive. A decade ago, China
ranked 20th as a world trader. Then exports of Dollars 18bn represented 4
per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and less than 1 per cent of world
trade. Projected exports this year of Dollars 100bn would represent 20 per
cent of China's GDP and more than 2.5 per cent of world trade.
The growing sophistication of Chinese products is also reflected in the
shift towards exports of manufactured items from 50 per cent in 1980 to 80
per cent last year. While China's success owes much to cheap labour costs -
textiles and footwear accounted for one third of 1992's Dollars 85bn in
exports - exports of machinery, electronic products and transport equipment
are the fastest growing areas.
High foreign investment in capital intensive areas spawned an increase of
about 86 per cent in exports of machinery and transport equipment in the
first nine months of 1992, compared with 1991. Trade in these items
accounted for 16 per cent of exports last year, compared with just 6 per
cent in 1988.
The contribution to China's booming trade in 1992 of Special Economic Zones
and coastal cities opened to foreign investment was also notable. Industrial
output in these areas increased by 72 per cent in the first half of 1992
compared with 1991, and the bulk of this was directed towards exports.
In their difficult discussions with representatives of their main trading
partners, Chinese officials are certain to point out that in spite of
China's export boom, the country is also coping with a surge in imports.
Imports are expected to grow by 19 per cent this year to Dollars 96bn,
compared with projected growth in exports of 16 per cent to around Dollars
98.5bn.
Western trade officials say the Chinese are becoming more concerned about
their shrinking trade surplus, down to Dollars 4.4bn last year, and its
impact on the country's reserves. Curbing import growth is certain to be
linked to problems associated with an overheating economy, which registered
12 per cent growth last year, and a risk of inflation.
However, curbs on imports would run counter to Chinese undertakings to
further liberalise its trade regime in preparation for its re-entry to Gatt.

<TEXT>
IN Shanghai, China's most populous city and home to a remarkable economic
boom, a new company is being established every 11 minutes, according to
local press reports.
Beijing is also a hive of new activity with an average of 106 companies
being registered each day in 1992, the Beijing Daily reports.
These registrations are mainly for small home-grown enterprises with limited
foreign involvement, but the figures reveal, nevertheless, an astonishing
overall trend.
In 1992, according to official statistics, foreign investment in China
quadrupled. The number of new foreign investment projects last year exceeded
40,000, equivalent to the total of the previous 13 years.
The contracted value in 1992 of newly approved foreign direct investment was
Dollars 57.51bn (Pounds 40bn), up 380 per cent on 1991. The realised amount
of foreign investment was Dollars 11.16bn, up 160 per cent, with Hong Kong
supplying about two-thirds of the funds.
Chinese investment overseas also increased last year. Some 2,500 enterprises
were set up in more than 120 countries with Chinese investment of Dollars
1.94bn.
According to a World Bank report, Reform and the role of the Plan in the
1990s, China is the 'destination for about 15 per cent of all direct foreign
investment in low and middle-income countries, and is exceeded in Asia only
by Singapore'.
Fixed asset investment grew by about 30 per cent in China in 1992.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP decline in bilateral trade between the Czech Republic and Slovakia
could damage the two countries' prospects unless it is halted, Mr Karel
Dyba, Czech minister for the economy, says.
'The Czech Republic has a high export ratio and its (economy) is very
dependent on exports. Less exports mean less orders and possibly less jobs.
We have a mutual interest (with Slovakia) to maintain a profitable trade
relationship,' Mr Dyba says.
Czech exports to Slovakia and Slovak exports to the Czech Republic fell by
17 per cent and 20 per cent respectively in 1992, following an already sharp
fall the previous year as both countries suffered from the collapse of
traditional markets in the former Comecon trade bloc.
Business between the two countries has also been hit by the break-up of the
former Czechoslovak state on January 1 this year.
New customs and tax regulations, and an earlier-than-planned end to the
currency union between the two states with the establishment of separate
currencies have compounded difficulties for many companies on both sides of
the border.
Several Czech and international companies are considering setting up
subsidiaries in Slovakia to overcome cumbersome bureaucratic customs
procedures, and some companies threaten to stop selling to or importing from
Slovakia altogether.
About 25 per cent of total Czech exports go to Slovakia, while 40 per cent
of Slovak exports go to the Czech republic. Last year Czech exports to
Slovakia were worth about Kcs100bn (Pounds 2.38bn) and Slovak exports to the
Czech Republic about Kcs90bn.

   BOGOTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO 50kg car bombs exploded in the centre of Bogota yesterday morning
leaving at least four people dead and dozens injured. Both bombs went off in
narrow, busy streets among shops and offices, causing panic in the Colombian
capital.
Police sources told Reuter they believed the bombing had been ordered by the
fugitive Medelln cocaine cartel leader Pablo Escobar.
The blasts damaged buildings and shattered glass for several blocks around,
and the streets were strewn with the wreckage of some 20 cars. Windows were
blown out of the Intercontinental-Tequendama, one of city's main hotels.
A Reuter reporter at the scene of the hotel blast said: 'People were trying
to leap from the upper floors of buildings after the blast to escape the
fires. It was total chaos.'
The government has accused Mr Escobar of leading a campaign of terror
against the state. Over the past two and a half weeks car bombs have
exploded in Medelln, Bogota and the oil city of Barrancabermeja, killing 37
people.
However, the two Medelln bombs were aimed at Mr Escobar's relatives and
properties, and were apparently detonated by a new anti-Escobar group called
the 'Pepes' - people persecuted by Pablo Escobar.
The authorities have increased the reward offered for information about Mr
Escobar to Dollars 7m. At the same time, the Pepes have killed several of Mr
Escobar's collaborators and employees in Medelln.
After Mr Escobar's escape from jail last July, he was expected to
re-surrender quickly, but this now seems unlikely. However, some interpret
the new wave of bombs as a last-ditch attempt to force the government to bow
to new conditions. The government has said any negotiations would be
impossible and Mr Escobar's only option is unconditional surrender.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Los Angeles repairs fabric but fails to heal wounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES has wasted no time sweeping away the debris of the riots that
racked the city nine months ago, leaving 42 dead and Dollars 1bn worth of
damage.
On almost every corner of Crenshaw Boulevard, running through a
predominantly black district west of the city centre, shops were looted and
burned during last spring's rioting. Today, many have reopened in newly
constructed or refurbished premises. Other buildings are under construction,
and even those plots where nothing is being done are tidied and neatly
fenced.
Many in Los Angeles express concern, however, that little has changed in
their city, and also frustration that government at city, state and federal
level has failed to respond to the challenge posed by riots on the scale
seen last year.
'The Los Angeles riots were supposed to be a wake-up call. I am beginning to
be afraid that people have put it on snooze control,' says Ms Dolly Gee, a
labour lawyer active in the Asian-American community.
Many Angelenos acknowledge a degree of tension as a second trial gets under
way for the police officers whose acquittal last year on charges of
assaulting Mr Rodney King sparked off the rioting, and the first cases
resulting from the riots themselves also come to court.
Relations between the city's African-American, Anglo, Latino and
Asian-American communities are still often tense, with particular friction
between blacks and Korean grocery store owners, who bore the brunt of last
year's destruction.
But there is also considerable irritation at a media portrait of inner Los
Angeles as a powder keg waiting to explode once again as soon as the
verdicts are returned in the police beating case, tried this time in a
federal court.
'I am not prepared to say that tensions are rising. In fact, I think that
generally speaking when you do have a riot a lot of energy is ventilated,
and maybe you are not going to have a riot again in the same place,' says
the Reverend James Lawson, pastor of the Holman United Methodist Church.
The verdict in the second King trial, whether guilty or innocent, is
unlikely to be greeted with as much surprise as the first acquittal, which
appeared to fly in the face of the clear evidence of a videotape of the
incident widely shown on television.
However, many blacks in Los Angeles resent what they see as the contrast
between the leniency accorded the police, and the much harsher treatment of
the black youths accused of beating a white lorry driver during the riots
whose trial is also getting under way.
Many Angelenos, ordinary citizens as well as community activists and
businessmen, express growing frustration at the lack of political leaders
with any kind of vision, beyond short-term riot prevention, for a new Los
Angeles equipped to deal with its variegated patterns of wealth, poverty,
race and culture.
'We do feel government shouldn't abdicate its role, and to some extent it
has,' said Mr Barry Sanders, a senior partner with the law firm of Latham &amp;
Watkins and co-chair of Rebuild LA, a task force set up in the wake of the
riots to try to bring economic development back to the city's more depressed
areas.
With no fewer than 52 candidates scrambling to take the place of retiring
Mayor Tom Bradley, that vacuum seems unlikely to be filled in the near
future.

responsible for the massacre in the town of Tlacotepec and is investigating
motives including competition over drug-trafficking, revenge between
families, or a combination of the two.
The men were killed, allegedly by a rival local clan, after attending the
funeral of three other members of their family. The scale of the crime, even
by the violent standards of Guerrero, has shocked Mexican opinion.
The region of Tlacotepec is well-known for its bountiful crops of heroin
poppies and marijuana, the mainstay of the otherwise impoverished local
economy.
Mr Carpizo has been ordered to crack down on drug-trafficking in an effort
by the government to limit politically embarrassing incidents, such as that
at Tlacotepec, usually associated with it. Over the weekend Mr Carpizo took
some steps in this direction, arresting a former under-director of federal
police, for alleged corruption. Another 22 senior or medium level officials
from the judicial police are also being investigated.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Cardenas comes back from the brink: A renewed attempt to
gain the Mexican presidency by a candidate who came very close last time in
1988
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE YEARS after losing the Mexican presidential election to Mr Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas continues to cast a spell over
the nation's politics. Son of the revered President Lazaro Cardenas and
named after the last Aztec king, he embodies for much of the country the
nationalist past that the present government is leaving behind.
Mr Cardenas has now announced his candidacy for next year's presidential
election, and is once again the most serious threat to the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). No other government or opposition
politician is as well-known (except for President Salinas, who is barred by
the constitution from running again) and few can match his rapport with the
poor and urban left.
Such qualities brought him to the brink of victory in the disputed elections
of 1988. Many observers, and Mr Cardenas himself, claim he would have won
had the voting been clean. Soon after Mr Salinas's victory, Mr Cardenas
declared that there had been a 'technical coup d'etat' - but in the end he
backed away from violent protests that could have engulfed the country.
Mr Cardenas's early declaration gives him 18 months to build the sort of
grass-roots support he enjoyed in 1988 - and a significant head start over
other contenders. The PRI candidate is not expected to be announced until
late this year or early next.
There are other factors in his favour. As Mr Cardenas says: 'Many more
people now in Mexico are conscious that things can change because of an
election.' In the past five years, the PRI has lost two governorships, and
conceded a third after a disputed election - the first time it has ever lost
such elections. The government is also under growing domestic and
international pressure to respect the vote.
Few doubt, however, that Mr Cardenas faces an uphill task. His newly-formed
Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD) has been beset by internal divisions,
while its aggressive, confrontational style has cost it support, and
undermined its claim to be a party for democracy. In a crucial test of
popularity, the PRD failed last year to win the gubernatorial election in
Michoacan, Mr Cardenas's home state. Nationally, its popularity is put at a
mere 10-15 per cent.
The PRI, for its part, has recovered much of its natural support, thanks to
a steady, if unspectacular, improvement in the economy. Inflation, which had
reached 160 per cent a year in 1987, is likely fall to single digits next
month, and per capita economic growth has been positive for the past four
years. Mr Salinas's energetic travels around the country in support of his
Dollars 3bn-a-year anti-poverty programme have further helped his
government.
But Mr Cardenas was also written off six years ago, before gaining momentum
in the last stages of the campaign. He is already distancing himself from
the PRD, and pointedly described himself as the 'citizen's candidate' when
announcing his bid for the Mexican presidency. This week, he will resign as
PRD president to give himself freedom to define his candidacy as he wishes.
He has also matured in the past five years. He has gone out of his way to
present himself as a reasonable, cautious politician, rather than the demon
conjured up by government propaganda. He has dined with important
businessmen, encouraged disaffected opposition leaders from the centre-right
Party of National Action to join his movement, and even suggested he would
withdraw his candidacy if a strong consensus candidate emerged from the
opposition.
There has also been a change in Mr Cardenas's views. 'He now realises that
Mexico's economic limitations mean social programmes have to be modest and
that a good relationship between Mexico and the US is crucial to the
financial sustainability of his programme,' says Mr Adolfo Aguilar, a close
friend and adviser.
Mr Cardenas says that while he would try to improve the proposed North
American Free Trade Agreement, he would not reject it. Nor, say advisers,
would he restrict foreign investment, renationalise industries privatised by
Mr Salinas, or deliberately endanger the macro-economic stability so
painfully acquired over the past decade.
His ideas for economic reform are not yet specific. Aides talk vaguely about
selective protectionism, subsidies to medium-sized and small industries,
reactivation of the internal economy, and greater social justice, but with
little sense of priorities. As Mr Aguilar says: 'There is still no clear
economic programme'.
Mr Cardenas will focus part of his campaign on the lack of democratic change
in Mexico - what he sees as the continuing intrusion of the governing party
in all walks of life, the biased coverage it receives on national
television, and its control of electoral and other nominally independent
organisations. In this way, he hopes to build up a strong base of support
from the politically active middle-class, even from those who might not
agree with his views on the economy.
But, coming from a man who spent 20 years in the PRI, such attacks often
lack credibility. And even if he overcomes all his other handicaps, these
very conditions will make it difficult for him to wrest power from the PRI,
just as they did in the far more favourable circumstances of 1988.

FT  16 FEB 93 / UK may ease Nigeria debt terms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major, the British prime minister, yesterday promised a sympathetic
response to Nigeria's plea for early debt rescheduling, provided economic
reforms set out in last month's budget were speedily implemented.
The encouragement was given during a 30-minute meeting with Mr Ernest
Shonekan, chairman of Nigeria's transitional council, who outlined the
budget measures and a three-year development plan.
Nigerian officials, who described the talks as friendly and constructive,
said that Mr Major made clear that rescheduling of the country's Dollars
27.6bn external debt would be conditional on renewal of a lapsed agreement
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
But the officials were heartened by the prime minister's apparent
willingness to implement Trinidad terms for Britain's share of the country's
official debt.
Mr Shonekan is understood to have stressed Nigeria's determination to
strengthen the private sector and improve the investment climate, while
making clear that the success of the new reform programme is dependent on a
reduced debt servicing burden.
Nigeria owes the Paris Club group of official creditors Dollars 16.5bn, and
Britain is the largest single creditor. Trinidad terms, a product of a
British initiative in 1991, allow 50 per cent write-off of official debt,
and long term rescheduling of the balance.
But British officials are understood to have warned yesterday that some
governments, including the US and Japan, remained reluctant to implement the
Trinidad proposals.
Creditors have been cautiously encouraged by Mr Shonekan's budget statement,
delivered at the end of January. It was designed to bolster economic reforms
first introduced in 1986, but later undermined by weak management, rapid
money supply growth and extra-budgetary spend-ing.
Mr Shonekan, a leading businessman co-opted in December to head the interim
council which runs Nigeria under military supervision, plans to seek backing
for the country's medium-term plan at an international conference scheduled
for London in April.
The three-year plan aims to cut annual inflation from 46 per cent in 1992 to
5 per cent by 1995, reduce the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP from
about 12.4 per cent in 1991 to 3.3 per cent in 1995 and achieve 5.3 per cent
real annual growth.
Last week a report issued by Morgan Grenfell, which noted that Nigerian par
bonds had risen to 40 per cent of face value 'on the back of the responsible
budget', warned of continuing strains in the Nigerian economy. Reserves had
'plummeted' from Dollars 3.7bn in August 1992 and 'could be as low as
Dollars 1bn', partly because of the cost of Nigeria's military involvement
in Liberia.
The report said that the gap between the official and parallel Naira, narrow
for much of 1992, now stands at about 28 per cent.

FT  16 FEB 93 / A spiral of violence in Gaza is 'forcing us all to be
radicals' / A look at the rubble of houses destroyed in a tough Israeli
crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mohammed al-Rubi, his wife and six children were woken at 6am last
Thursday by Israeli troops, who told them to leave their newly built home in
Khan Younis in the Gaza Strip while it was searched.
Twelve hours later, when the family was allowed back to the house, it was an
uninhabitable ruin.
While the al-Rubis spent the day locked up in a nearby building - the men
bound and blindfolded - a squad of troops, supported by a helicopter,
rocketed their home with anti-tank missiles, then entered it firing
automatic rifles and finally blew it apart with explosives.
Much the same treatment was meted out to 18 other houses in the same block
in a methodical operation that Palestinians, United Nations officials and
human rights workers in Gaza describe as by far the biggest in a series of
similar military attacks in recent months.
The operations have become the latest source of fury in Gaza, where the
conflict between Israel and the Palestinians appears to be as profound now
as at any time during the five years of the intifada, the uprising against
Israeli rule.
Mounting casualties among Palestinian demonstrators, increased armed attacks
on troops and the mass expulsion in December of hundreds of alleged Islamic
militants to Lebanon - all taking place against a background of rising
economic distress - have stoked the political temperature.
The deterioration in Gaza threatens to cut the ground from under Palestinian
leaders wanting to resume peace negotiations with Israel just as Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, travels to the Middle East in an
attempt to push forward the process.
When Mr Faisal Husseini, head of the Palestinian negotiating team, visited
the scene of the Khan Younis operation on Saturday he was greeted with
insults and slogans supporting Hamas, the militant Islamic movement which
opposes both the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the talks.
The crowd's anger was understandable. Of the 19 houses attacked, 10 were
rendered uninhabitable, leaving 18 families homeless out of 31 who lived in
the block. Even those houses not completely destroyed suffered extensive
damage. Troops riddled wardrobes, refrigerators, televisions, bathtubs,
water tanks and phones with bullets. Many complained their cash savings and
jewellery were missing, some burnt in fires which the troops refused to let
local fire crews douse.
Mr al-Rubi had spent 35,000 Jordanian Dinars (Pounds 35,000) building and
furnishing his house in the 15 months since he was expelled from Kuwait, his
apartment there having been ransacked during the Iraqi occupation.
The army says the Khan Younis operation - and similar previous attacks  -
are aimed at rooting out gunmen from Hamas and PLO factions responsible for
killing Israeli soldiers in recent months. But Palestinians say the scale of
destruction, carried out with no legal order, amounts to collective
punishment and intimidation.
Increased armed attacks on the army - five soldiers have been killed in Gaza
since last October - have undoubtedly increased the nervousness of troops on
the streets and their commanders, including Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime
minister, who fears public reaction in Israel to such killings.
It seems one effect of this tension has been a tougher reaction to general
unrest. Palestinian casualties have risen sharply in recent months,
especially since the expulsions.
Figures from the Gaza Centre for Rights and Law show 15 people were killed
by army gunfire from mid-July to mid-November, while 27 were killed in
December and January. The number wounded rose from 713 in July-November to
911 in December-January, including 355 children under 16.
The army has denied allegations that it has relaxed regulations governing
when soldiers can open fire on demonstrators. Mr Douglas Ierley of the Gaza
Centre argues that whether or not this is true, troops have frequently
resorted to live fire when their lives were not in danger.
The ferment in Gaza is fed by a depressing economic situation. According to
UN figures, per capita gross national product has tumbled since the 1990-91
Gulf crisis from around Dollars 1,200 (Pounds 844) a year to Dollars 790
(Pounds 556).
The chief reason is the restriction on permits to work in Israel, long the
main source of income for most of Gaza's 750,000 people.
Before the intifada, 80,000 Gazans worked in Israel; before the Gulf crisis
the number had fallen to 60,000; now it is no more than 35,000.
Many people get by through subsistence-level street trading and small
workshops. But unemployment is reckoned by UNWRA, the UN Palestinian
refugees welfare agency, to be at 35-40 per cent of the workforce.
The population is growing at an alarming 4.5 per cent a year, one of the
highest rates in the world in a place which is already a sink of squalor and
overcrowding.
Islamic institutions - and Hamas in particular - have been able to exploit
these conditions for political advantage.
Not only do they offer a radical solution to Gaza's otherwise hope-starved
young people; they use their local networks to distribute welfare payments
to poor, bereaved families and the families of prisoners.
Similar payments from the PLO have all but stopped since its funding from
Gulf countries dried up after the Gulf crisis.
It is impossible to know the balance of public support in Gaza between the
secular PLO on one side and Hamas and other Islamic groups such as Islamic
Jihad.
But a Palestinian journalist who has over several years tracked elections in
professional and academic institutions reckons that support for the Islamic
groups may have grown from around 40 per cent to as much as 50 per cent.
PLO-affiliated leaders feel squeezed. Mr Saeb Erekat, a senior delegate to
the peace talks, is from the West Bank but reflects the exposure all his
colleagues feel. 'I have never felt such weakness,' he says. 'We promised we
would achieve something. Now people are banging on the table. It is payback
time and I am empty-handed.'
In Khan Younis, Mr al-Rubi put it another way as he stood in the rubble of
his house. 'I have no hope now. They are forcing us all to be radicals.'

FT  16 FEB 93 / Kyrgyz credit deal expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan expects to sign a Dollars
300m-Dollars 350m (Pounds 212m-Pounds 248m) loan agreement soon with western
credit institutions led by the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank, Mr Tursunbek Chyngyshev, the Kyrgyz prime minister, said in London
yesterday.
Agreement on the loan would enable the Central Asian republic to continue
with its free market reforms.
The republic had so far privatised 11 per cent of the country's former state
property, mainly in retailing and services, the prime minister said. It
hoped more than a third of the country's industry, agriculture and services
would be in private hands by the end of this year, and two-thirds by the end
of 1994.
Mr Chyngyshev, who is in the UK on a five-day visit, said he hoped western
counties would help to underpin economic restructuring with technical
assistance and foreign investment in particular.
The government of Kyrgyzstan was ready to guarantee foreign joint ventures
in the republic.
Reform was proceeding with the help of grants such as the Ecu9.23bn (Pounds
7.49bn) European Community technical assistance grant for former Soviet
states.
However, the republic's economic progress was being hampered by the
instability of the Russian economy and the rouble. If the rouble failed to
stabilise, Kyrgyzstan, part of rouble economic zone, would introduce its own
currency if it secured sufficient funding.

<TEXT>
MR FOUAD SULTAN, Egypt's tourism minister, said yesterday that Moslem
militant attacks on foreign tourists had cost the country Dollars 700m
(Pounds 496m), Reuter reports from Cairo.
Despite tough security measures taken by the government to safeguard the
country's main source of foreign currency, hoteliers and tourist operators
say business is slack.
Mr Sultan said militant attacks, in which one British woman was killed and
two Britons and five Germans were wounded late last year, caused a 20 per
cent reduction in revenues compared with the same period the year before.
'Between Dollars 60m and Dollars 70m is lost in receipts each month. The
losses have reached about Dollars 700m so far,' Mr Sultan said. 'If that
pace continues, the losses in the fiscal year 1992-93 (which ends in June)
will reach about Dollars 1bn.'
He said that when calculating revenues based on government forecasts, the
losses could be even more. Egypt had expected 4m visitors for the fiscal
year 1992-93 and more than Dollars 4bn in revenues.
Mr Sultan said in the year 1991-92 an estimated 3m tourists visited Egypt,
generating Dollars 3.5bn.
He said the tourism industry accounted for 30 per cent of Egypt's foreign
currency receipts and 10 per cent of its gross domestic product.
Many people employed in the tourism business fear for their jobs.
The pyramids and ancient Pharaonic temples - Egypt's main tourist
attractions - are virtually empty. Luxury hotels, tourist villages and Red
Sea beaches are quiet. Egyptian hoteliers are nostalgic about the boom days.
Boats and river cruisers lie idle along the banks of the Nile waiting for
clients. Souvenir shops have everything except shoppers.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Chinese find growing affluence takes a toll as traffic
snarls and road deaths mount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC reforms may have brought spectacular material rewards to millions
of Chinese, but growing affluence is also taking its toll - on the country's
roads.
China reported 60,000 fatalities last year, an increase of 10 per cent on
the year before, but the actual toll could be much higher, perhaps as many
as 100,000 road deaths.
An official of the Traffic Control Department of the Ministry of Public
Security said the official figure of 60,000 fatalities had 'a lot of water
in it' - a Chinese expression indicating that the official statistic
under-estimated the gravity of the situation.
'The real figure can't be published because it's just too shocking,' he
said. 'The internal estimate was 100,000 last year.'
China's economic boom - the economy grew by a staggering 12 per cent in 1992
 -has brought with it a flood of new vehicles on to the country's already
congested roads.
Traffic jams are now the rule rather than the exception in many of China's
cities. Beijing's traffic has become particularly heavy in the past year due
in part to a surge of new joint ventures involving foreign participation.
According to a recent New China News Agency despatch, China, with a
population of 1.1bn, had 6m cars, buses and trucks using its roads. But this
official figure almost certainly understates vehicle numbers.
China's approach to road safety seems haphazard and limited resources appear
to have been devoted to publicity campaigns. That may be about to change, as
the cost to the community of road trauma dawns on the authorities. One
indication of growing official concern is that two decades after most
western countries introduced seat belt regulations, China is to follow suit.
By July, new vehicles will be required to fit belts as standard equipment.
Vehicles already on the road will be required to conform or be deemed
unroadworthy. Fines for non-use of seat belts will be five yuan (about 60
pence), a fairly derisory amount if the Chinese are indeed serious about
improving road safety.
According to the spokesman for the Public Security Ministry's traffic
department, some 70 per cent of road accidents occurred in country areas
where ignorance of road safety and traffic rules tended to be greater.
The official blamed bad driving for most of the accidents. 'The driving
standards of Chinese motorists are very poor,' he said. 'They don't care
about traffic rules. Once they get on the road they drive like crazy.'
Mr Yang Jinyao, deputy principal of the Beijing Driver's Training School,
said that in the capital drivers were subjected to a rigorous training
schedule, but with the rapid increase of numbers of cars on the road it was
inevitable the toll would rise.
He said Chinese drivers were certainly not as safety conscious as
westerners. Drink-driving was also a main problem. He estimated that about
one third of serious accidents involved a drunk driver.
As more and more Chinese take to the roads in motor vehicles, forsaking the
push-bike that had transported them with relative safety for so many years,
they are beginning to take out accident insurance.
But numbers availing themselves of this protection are still small,
according to a representative of the People's Insurance Company of China.
Third party insurance is compulsory.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Canberra out to sweeten voters: Parties compete for crucial
sugar belt backing in election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S conservative opposition parties reached deep into the pork
barrel yesterday to shore up electoral support in the politically important
sugar belt.
The sugar industry emerged as an issue in the March 13 federal election when
the Labor government announced a three-year freeze on protective tariffs,
which are being reduced for most other industries.
The freeze was designed to help Labor's prospects in seven marginal seats in
Queensland and northern New South Wales, six of which are held by government
MPs with majorities of less than 5 per cent.
In a counter-offer to sugar farmers, the conservative Liberal/National party
coalition said it would go ahead with plans to abolish tariffs by the year
2000 but would set aside ADollars 145m (Pounds 67.7m) to compensate growers.
The coalition said its plan would ensure that consumers and industries that
use sugar would benefit from lower prices without re-ducing the incomes of
sugar producers.
Mr John Hewson, the opposition leader in Canberra, said the package would
maintain the integrity of the coalition's tariff reduction policy while
ensuring that 'the taxpayer picks up the tab for only a limited period of
time'.
Mr Harry Bonano, the chairman of the Queensland canegrowers' association,
said there was 'very little difference' between the competing offers.
Ironically, sugar production is one of Australia's most efficient
industries, mainly because growers export about 80 per cent of production at
world prices.
But the conservative package will give a further boost to the coalition,
which believes its electoral momentum is increasing after Mr Hewson's strong
performance in a televised debate on Sunday.
The coalition also threw the government on the defensive by challenging
claims by Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, that Labor would eliminate
the federal budget deficit by 1996-97.
The undertaking contrasted sharply with Mr Keating's economic statement last
week, which forecast a budget deficit equivalent to one per cent of gross
domestic product in 1996-97.

Mr Michio Watanabe, Japanese foreign minister and deputy prime minister,
pictured above in parliament yesterday, was rushed to hospital just hours
after returning from talks in Washington with officials of the Clinton
administration, Charles Leadbeater writes from Tokyo.
His illness, which will keep him in hospital for about two weeks, casts a
heavy shadow over his ambitions to succeed Mr Kiichi Miyazawa as prime
minister later this year. In recent weeks Mr Watanabe and Mr Miyazawa have
clashed on a range of foreign policy issues, such as whether Japan should
expand its role in United Nations peacekeeping operations. The visit of the
US was widely seen as part of Mr Watanabe's campaign to improve his public
profile. Mr Watanabe spent a month and a half in hospital last year after an
operation to remove gallstone.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Gangsters add weight to boardroom coup
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE police are investigating a boardroom coup at Joshin Denki, a
leading electronics retailer, in which gangsters were apparently hired by
one faction to force the resignation of the company's president.
Gangsters occasionally appear at shareholders' meetings to ask awkward
questions and generally embarrass a company's board, but the Joshin Denki
case has stirred controversy because of the close ties between gang members
and executives at a retailer listed on the Tokyo stock exchange.
Police yesterday raided the Osaka headquarters of Joshin Denki and
questioned the apparent victor in the boardroom showdown, Mrs Mitsuko Jogu,
54, widow of the company's founder and, for the past two years, Joshin's
president.
Japanese media were fascinated by Mrs Jogu's apparent role as mastermind of
the coup, while police wanted to know whether she personally authorised
another executive to hire five gangsters in February 1990 to coerce the then
president, Mr Seishi Mano, to resign.
For services rendered, the five gangsters, who reportedly cornered Mr Mano
over his role in an unsuccessful property deal, received Y30m (Pounds
160,000) after his resignation in January last year. He had argued with the
family over the direction of the company since taking office in May 1986.
The curious case comes as the Japanese government is considering reforms to
the Commercial Code that would force listed companies to provide more
information to shareholders and generally be more open in their dealings.
Mrs Jogu holds only 4.3 per cent of the company's shares, but apparently
considered that it was still a family business and she was entitled to use
whatever means necessary to force Mr Mano's resignation.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Bank of Tokyo fears Beijing's wrath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Tokyo is embarrassed by its success in winning Taiwanese
government approval to open a branch in Taipei, because the bank fears that
the announcement may offend a Chinese government still sensitive about
dealings with the 'rebel province'.
Japanese financial institutions attempt to be discreet in their dealings
with Taiwanese authorities, while the Taiwanese, conscious of their
competition with Beijing, are keen to boast about broader ties with the
international financial community.
The Bank of Tokyo yesterday refused to confirm that its representative
office would be upgraded to branch status, saying only that 'the authorities
in Taipei have made an announcement' and suggesting that the approval
process was not yet complete.
The most important part of that approval process is securing the necessary
nod from Beijing, which punished the Bank of Tokyo in 1990 when it announced
plans to open a Taipei representative office. A financial joint venture
planned by the bank in Shanghai was delayed, and the Chinese government
suggested that it would be denied other opportunities in the mainland
market.
Japan's foreign ministry has encouraged financial and non-financial
companies to expand to Taiwan, and called in Chinese diplomats in 1990 to
complain against the action taken against the Bank of Tokyo. The matter was
also raised at ministerial meetings, and Beijing eventually forgave the
bank.
But the bank is still wary of irritating the Chinese government, which is
concerned that Taiwan is on a course to independence from the mainalnd.
Japanese officials counter these concerns by arguing that the Bank of Tokyo
and other financial institutions act as 'a bridge' between Taipei and
Beijing.
The Japanese government is also encouraging newspapers to open offices in
Taiwan. Only one group, Sankei, has a resident correspondent, and Chinese
officials have warned off other newsapapers. The Taiwanese foreign minister
is due shortly in Japan, the first such visit since the two sides cut
diplomatic ties in 1972, Reuter adds from Tokyo.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIOR ministers from east and west Europe gathering in Budapest yesterday
for a conference on migration were immediately pressed by Germany to help
curb the influx of illegal immigrants.
Germany is urging east European countries to take back nationals resident
elsewhere without permission, and speed migrants' return to their country of
origin. Also high on the agenda is a proposal to co-ordinate action on
international 'human smuggling' groups.
The Germans want 'non-front-line' western countries to share the burden of
financial aid towards strengthening eastern Europe's immigration controls.
The conference coincides with German efforts to tighten the country's
liberal asylum rules.
Germany's proposed constitutional amendment would allow authorities to turn
back claimants for refugee status if they arrive from 'safe' neighbouring
east European countries. Poland and the Czech Republic are determined not to
become a cordon sanitaire for seekers of asylum in Germany.
Bonn's efforts have an added urgency because of continuing racist attacks
against foreigners. But EC countries less affected by immigration from
eastern Europe are grudging in their solidarity. UK officials said yesterday
that, while backing recommendations on exchange of information, they did not
wish to see new measures, describing as unrealistic ideas about financial
aid.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Russia offers US arms sales deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA is to propose to the US an 'arm sales for arms conversion' plan under
which the west would grant Moscow access to its protected arms markets.
The idea will be put forward next week by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian
foreign minister, in talks in Geneva with Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state.
Mr Kozyrev, speaking to the Financial Times yesterday, said the west should
go beyond providing credits, humanitarian aid and more support - 'though all
of these are greatly valued' - to open up markets to weaponry and related
technology.
The Geneva meeting, scheduled for February 25, is the first between the two
since Mr Christopher was appointed last month.
Mr Kozyrev said he wanted to declare a 'fresh start' in US-Russian
relations: 'We laid the foundations of a new relationship with the Bush
administration, now it is important to implement these relationships in the
field of conflict management, especially in Central Asia and in the Middle
East, using extensively the UN Security Council.'
In Mr Kozyrev's conception for new weapons markets, which he unveiled in
part to the Russian parliament at the end of last week, the west would
ensure that in the 'more than 100 countries' where arms trading was accepted
and under no sanctions, contracts would be deliberately opened to Russian
competition.
Though he said no western government had openly excluded Russia from its
arms markets, 'such issues are largely political,' and informal barriers had
operated.
In return, Russia would use the proceeds of the weapons sales 'not to boost
the military industrial complex' but for civilian use, largely for
conversion of military plants.
'I would say to the US and other western countries: consider as a political
decision giving a place to Russia in these markets. This is the same as
economic assistance, it is economic assistance.
'If we sell MiG-31s or Sukhoi-27s to someone, it is earned money and will be
less humiliating for Russia. The money would be used for conversion, and
(some of it) for consumer goods and new machinery.
'When the Soviet Union existed, billions were found for defence: this is a
new challenge and it takes a new strategy and a new boldness; otherwise, the
west will miss an historic opportunity'.
Mr Kozyrev told the Russian parliament that Russia was taking part in the
Abu Dhabi arms fair and was seeking contracts 'worth millions' at an event
from which the Soviet Union had been excluded.
However, he declared that he was concerned that some Russian arms suppliers
were talking about the provision of systems 'up to and including strategic
weapons'.
Some of these arms suppliers were attempting to deal with countries against
whom arms sanctions had been agreed, and it was only strong state control
that could prevent a 'chaotic' spread of arms around the world.
At the same time, only an agreement with the west to open up its markets
could stop the impoverished Russians pursuing national self-interest.
The former Soviet Union had been a major arms supplier, but to 'the wrong
people', mainly its third world clients.
'I don't want to continue to supply the wrong people,' Mr Kozyrev added.

   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michal Kovac, 62, an economist and former chairman of the Czechoslovak
federal parliament, was elected president of Slovakia yesterday, ending some
of the political uncertainty over the newly independent state's future.
In an earlier round of voting last month, none of the candidates won the
necessary three-fifths majority of the votes needed in the 150-seat Slovak
parliament to elect a president. Mr Kovac, who was backed by the ruling
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), was the only candidate in this
round of voting, and won comfortably with 106 votes.
His election will come as a relief to Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak prime
minister, following last month's inconclusive vote when another leading HZDS
member failed to win after two days of voting.
Those elections were followed by bitter recriminations within the ruling
party, with threats of a split caused by a dispute between the prime
minister and Mr Milan Knazko, foreign minister, who had urged MPs not to
vote for the party's own candidate.
Slovakia became independent on January 1 when the former Czechoslovak state
was dissolved. Uncertainty about the country's future political and economic
direction were exacerbated by rows over Mr Meciar's leadership, and caused a
hasty end to the currency union with the Czech Republic earlier this month.

   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of Romanians marched through Bucharest yesterday shouting for
President Iliescu's resignation in the first workers' street protest against
the government which took office in November, Reuter reports from Bucharest.
Discontent over dwindling wages, soaring prices and growing unemployment has
built up over the past month with a series of strikes and threatened
stoppages, as well as quarrels between unions and the government during wage
negotiations.
Many of the 3,000 workers who massed in Revolution Square in icy weather
also shouted slogans demanding bread and pay rises.
The protesters, led by the Solidarity 90 trade union federation, are
demanding better welfare provision, new jobs and minimum monthly pay of
41,000 lei (Pounds 56) instead of the present 17,300. The marchers carried
banners daubed with slogans such as 'Where is the bread?'
Romania is facing one of its worst droughts this century, and this year's
grain crop could be severely affected, weather forecasters said.
The drought is being worsened by a lack of fertilisers and a shortage of
fuel and farming equipment. This helped slash Romania's grain crop by 36.3
per cent to 12.3m tonnes in 1992, the National Statistics Board said.
An official forecast for the 1993 grain crop was not yet available. Last
year, Romania imported 1.1m tonnes of wheat and over 263,000 tonnes of maize
to make up for domestic crop shortages.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Brazauskas named new president of Lithuania: Pledges of less
painful market reform vindicated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VILNIUS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Algirdas Brazauskas, Lithuania's popular former communist leader, was
yesterday declared the winner of the presidential election. He was elected
with a 60 per cent majority, vindicating his conciliatory style and promises
of less painful market reform.
Mr Brazauskas' victory sealed a comeback which began when his renamed
Democratic Labour Party trounced Prof Vytautas Landsbergis, the republic's
confrontational independence leader, in parliamentary elections in November
of last year.
Mr Stasys Lozoraitis, the ambassador to the US backed by Mr Landsbergis'
demoralised Sajudis movement, received 39 per cent of the vote.
As the Baltic republic's first directly elected president, Mr Brazauskas,
62, will be able to appoint the prime minister and dissolve parliament.
Respected for splitting the Lithuanian communist party from Moscow three
years ago in one of the republic's first steps towards independence, Mr
Brazauskas now faces the challenge of delivering his pre-election promises.
These include improved relations with Russia to obtain cheaper energy
supplies, restoring trading links with its former Soviet neighbours, and
boosting industrial production, which fell 55 per cent in the past two
years.
Yesterday he said he would remove 'as soon as possible all the obstacles' to
foreign investment, and vowed to speed up privatisation.
This was despite effectively calling a halt to the privatisation programme
of his radical predecessors.
He has claimed that his experience in government can help redress mistakes
made by his predecessors.
He says, for example, that breakneck attempts last year to distribute
collective agricultural land to pre-communist owners and new independent
farmers will spell catastrophe unless the government is able to restore
'order' to the sector to enable spring sowing to match last year's levels.
However, he will have little room for manoeuvre on his promises to lessen
the economic pain of price liberalisation and social spending cuts if he
also carries out his promise to introduce a fully fledged Lithuanian
currency and maintain financial policies agreed with the International
Monetary Fund.
Although the Lithuanian parliament has just required state-owned enterprises
to sell 25 per cent of their export earnings to the state, the republic
remains strapped for foreign exchange and foreign investment.
Mr Landsbergis did not stand in the presidential elections, but Mr
Brazauskas' victory owes much to popular discontent with Mr Landsbergis.
'These radical nationalist movements make mistakes, lose their authority and
then turn round and blame communists,' Mr Brazauskas said at the weekend.
He said yesterday, however, that there was no question of returning to
communism, explaining that party membership had simply been a way of getting
ahead in the old system.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Budget deficit piles pressure on Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian Treasury yesterday announced the 1992 budget deficit had
overshot earlier estimates by L11,000bn and had totalled L163,150bn (Pounds
74.27bn).
The overshoot had been widely expected since projected revenues from
privatisation had failed to materialise. The deficit, equivalent to nearly
11 per cent of GDP, means the government will be under pressure to introduce
a mini-budget before the end of June.
With the Amato government under increasing political threat and the need to
introduce electoral reform, the momentum for privatisation could slow,
according to foreign bankers and local analysts.
A slower pace in privatisation is likely to place even more pressure on the
government to find alternative resources to hold down the public sector
deficit.
Privatisations had been scheduled to raise L7,000bn in 1992, largely from
divestitures in the banking sector. Delays and changes in the privatisation
plan held back these sales.
This year the government also plans to raise L7,000bn from privatisation;
but this revenue will come from a mixture of assets which should have been
sold in 1992 and a scaling down of the sell-offs planned when the 1993
budget was drawn up last September.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE professional classes have become the latest casualties of France's
rising unemployment rate with nearly 133,000 salaried employees losing their
jobs in 1992, according to the latest figures from Insee, the state
statistics institute.
The overall number of people without jobs in France rose by 5 per cent to
2.98m last year. The worst affected areas of the economy, according to
Insee, were construction and manufacturing.
Until recently, professional people were relatively immune from joblessness.
The number of salaried employees in France rose by 1.1 per cent in 1990 and
fell by just 0.7 per cent in 1991.
But the ranks of salaried employees fell by 0.9 per cent to 14.74m in 1992,
with the rate of job losses accelerating as the year progressed.
Unemployment is one of the main political problems facing France's ruling
Socialist party in the run-up to next month's legislative elections.
Fears of joblessness among salaried employees could cause additional
problems for the Socialists, who have traditionally enjoyed support from
professional workers such as teachers, social service workers and the media.
The government has recently tried to stem the tide of manufacturing job
losses with its controversial attempts to stop Hoover, the US vacuum cleaner
company, from closing its Dijon factory and Elf Aquitaine, the
state-controlled oil group, from relocating a laboratory at Boussens in
south-west France.
Meanwhile Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the Socialist prime minister, yesterday met
representatives of French industry and unions in Paris in order to discuss
his proposals for pension reform.
Mr Rene Teulade, minister for social affairs, will this week present plans
to the cabinet for a FFr100m (Pounds 12.3m) guarantee fund to plug the
rising pension budget deficit.
The fund, financed by the proceeds of the privatisation programme,
represents a compromise on Mr Beregovoy's earlier hopes of introducing
private pensions to supplement the existing state schemes.
The centre-right coalition, firm favourites to win the March poll, has
included plans for private pensions in their election manifesto.

<TEXT>
THE FRENCH public should have the right to call for citizens' referendums in
conjunction with members of parliament, according to an official inquiry
into the constitution.
The inquiry, which was initiated by President Francois Mitterrand last
November and headed by Mr Georges Vendel, an eminent French jurist, revealed
its proposals for constitutional reform yesterday evening to the president
at the Elysee palace in Paris. The president plans to present its finding to
French parliament within the next fortnight.
The proposals include requiring each new French government to secure a vote
of confidence from parliament and replacing the present system whereby the
National Assembly sits for two sessions each year with one session lasting
from October to June.
The panel also proposes that, given the length of the new session, members
of parliament should not be allowed also to occupy other public positions
such as city mayors or presidents of regional councils.
Such changes are intended to clarify and strengthen the role of the French
parliament. In the past, the parliament's power has been inhibited by the
fragmented nature of French party politics and by the influence of the
president, who is responsible for specific areas of policy including foreign
affairs.
However, the inquiry opted to maintain the present system whereby the
president is elected for seven years with the possibility of re-election.
There had been speculation that it might try to reduce the president to the
same five-year term as the parliament.
The conservative opposition, on course for a landslide victory in next
month's legislative elections and a second term of 'cohabitation' with the
Socialist president, refused to take part in the inquiry, arguing it was an
attempt by President Mitterrand to distract attention from France's
political problems.

FT  16 FEB 93 / SPD plan to tax high earners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A PLAN to raise taxes on Germany's higher earners, and to impose a labour
market levy on civil servants and the self-employed, was proposed yesterday
by the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) as an alternative 'solidarity pact'
with east Germany.
The package, formally approved by the party leadership in Bonn, would also
include more drastic dismantling of tax allowances, and fewer cuts in social
spending, than the alternative plan tabled by the ruling German coalition.
Mr Bjorn Engholm, the SPD leader, presented his proposals yesterday as a
negotiating package for the government and expressed his belief that the two
sides would reach some compromise in the coming months.
'At least we will agree on a partial package,' he said after a press
conference in Bonn. 'We need it for the sake of the German economy.' He said
that the Social Democrats remained committed to the concept of a 'solidarity
pact' to finance recovery in east Germany.
Employment has collapsed in the east since unification, along with large
parts of the country's former state-owned industry.
The SPD also rejected the government's parallel plan for the introduction of
a special motorway toll, proposed to help finance the reform of the
country's railway system. The party says that such a charge - proposed at
between DM300 (Pounds 127.10) and DM400 a year for motorway users - was
'senseless both ecologically, and as a transport policy'.
Mr Engholm said the SPD estimated the financing gap for the German
government and western Lander, needed to finance subsidies in the east, at
DM16bn in 1993, between DM35bn and DM40bn in 1994, and DM110bn in 1995.
He said that spending cuts - excluding the most drastic reductions in
unemployment benefit and other social payments proposed by the government -
would only reach a maximum of DM4bn in the current year.
As a result, the introduction of an income tax levy on the better paid, and
of a labour market levy on those who do not pay existing unemployment
benefit (mainly government servants and the self-employed), was necessary
from July 1.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has set his heart against any tax rise before January
1 1995, and his spokesman said yesterday that he saw no sign of a change.
However both sides agree that negotiations between their positions are
necessary, and Mr Engholm and Mr Kohl - regardless of what their colleagues
may say in public - both appear committed to that process.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Bonn attacked on arms exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government was under attack from left and right yesterday for
apparent double standards in its strict arms export controls, after it
approved the sale of missile parts for Taiwan and tank engines for the
United Arab Emirates.
The decision to allow the export of electronic parts for US-manufactured
Patriot and Ram anti-aircraft and anti-missile missiles to Taiwan was
confirmed by the German government just two weeks after it refused to sell
10 German-built submarines to the Taipei government, for fear of alienating
China.
At the same time it emerged that the Federal Security Council, the secretive
body to which all arms export decisions must be submitted, had approved the
sale of diesel engines from the German Leopard tank, to be installed in
French vehicles sold to the UAE - although a sale of complete Leopard tanks
would not have been approved.
The German government is also under attack for agreeing earlier this month
to supply Indonesia with 39 former East German naval ships in spite of
protests from Portugal because of human rights violations in their former
colony of East Timor.
Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics minister, called on the government
either to allow the export of the submarines to Taiwan, or to cancel its
approval of the missile technology. He said that if it was clear that fear
of Chinese anger over the exports was not important, then the export of
submarines - securing thousands of German jobs in the hard-hit shipbuilding
industry - should be given high priority.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, defended the decision to export
Patriot and Ram missile technology on the grounds that it was a joint
project with the US.
'If we do not deliver our part of the project, then nobody will work with us
any more,' he said.
A second reason for approving the project was that the missiles - one
land-based and the other sea-based - were both defensive.
He was not able to comment on the sale of MTU engines for the French Leclerc
battle tanks being sold to the UAE, although he was unaware of any change in
policy on arms sales to the Middle East.
Bonn has up to now banned German tank sales in the region and, in the 1980s,
halted efforts to sell a German-British tank there.
As for the sales to Indonesia, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has promised to raise
the question of human rights violations in East Timor - at least in private
discussions - on his forthcoming visit to Jakarta.

MR Glafcos Clerides, who narrowly won the presidential election in Cyprus on
Sunday, yesterday said he would ask for a postponement in UN-sponsored peace
talks, Reuter reports from Nicosia.
On the other side of the divided island, Turkish-Cypriot leader Mr Rauf
Denktash said resuming the talks as had been planned next March would be
futile.
Mr Clerides, the veteran leader of the right-wing Democratic Rally party,
beat incumbent Mr George Vassiliou by a majority of 1,998 votes with the
backing of the centre-right Diko party, which is unwilling to make
concessions to the Turkish Cypriot minority. Mr Clerides said that before
peace talks he needed to consult with the Cypriot and Greek political
leadership.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Kozyrev in plea to US over Bosnia peace
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANDRE Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, yesterday appealed to the US to
back the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia - and said the Bosnians should
have 'no illusions' they would get more help from the international
community, including the US, than available under the plan.
In Washington, meanwhile, the European Community today will make clear to
the US that it continues to give full support to the international
mediators' plan for a Bosnian peace settlement.
Mr Kozyrev was speaking to the Financial Times after a meeting in Moscow
over the weekend with Mr Reginald Bartholomew, the US special envoy for
Bosnia.
Mr Kozyrev claimed that he had a 'clear understanding' with both Mr
Bartholomew and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state.
He expected the US to support the Vance-Owen plan 'with only a few
corrections, but they must be small corrections'.
He was 'cautiously optimistic' that the Vance-Owen plan would soon be put
to, and adopted by, the United Nations Security Council.
Mr Kozyrev said the virtue of the Vance-Owen plan was that 'it left everyone
equally unhappy'.
Russian-US-European co-operation on former Yugoslavia has been close and the
Russian government has so far backed both sanctions against Serbia and UN
intervention. Now, however, Mr Kozyrev is giving a clear signal that an
independent effort by the US to elaborate a different strategy would not
find support in Moscow.
The EC's continued backing for the mediators' plan will be stressed in
Washington today by Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, the Danish foreign minister,
whose country currently holds the EC presidency.
Mr Petersen is due to have talks with Mr Christopher after being briefed by
the mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, in New York yesterday.
The Danish minister said developments since the EC foreign ministers'
reaffirmation of their support for the Vance-Owen plan on February 1 had
merely confirmed that this was the right formula for dealing with the
Bosnian conflict.
'The full and unequivocal support for the Vance-Owen plan is called for,' he
said.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Italy under pressure on deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian treasury yesterday announced the 1992 budget deficit had
overshot earlier estimates by L11,000bn and had totalled L163,150bn (Pounds
74.27bn).
The overshoot had been widely expected since projected revenues from
privatisation had failed to materialise. The deficit, equivalent to nearly
11 per cent of GDP, means the government will be under pressure to introduce
a mini-budget before the end of June.
With the Amato government under increasing political threat and the need to
introduce electoral reform, the momentum for privatisation could slow,
according to foreign bankers and local analysts.
A slower pace in privatisation is likely to place even more pressure on the
government to find alternative resources to hold down the public sector
deficit.
Privatisations had been scheduled to raise L7,000bn in 1992, largely from
divestitures in the banking sector. Delays and changes in the privatisation
plan held back these sales.
This year the government also plans to raise L7,000bn from privatisation;
but this revenue will come from a mixture of assets which should have been
sold in 1992 and a scaling down of the sell-offs envisaged when the 1993
budget was drawn up last September.
The government plans to raise L15,000bn in 1994 and a further L12,000bn in
1995.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Macedonians get scent of an identity: Athens concessions
over a name for the former Yugoslav republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE is finally making concessions in its dispute over the name of
Macedonia, the former Yugoslav republic. It follows a year of aggressive
posturing that has infuriated its European Community partners and Balkan
neighbours.
Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, Greek prime minister, has accepted the idea of a
United Nations-sponsored arbitration process to find a name by which the
republic can be recognised internationally. So far only a handful of
countries, among them Russia and Turkey, have recognised Macedonia.
Mr Mitsotakis is willing to accept one of the compound names suggested last
year as a way of distinguishing a sovereign Macedonia from the adjoining
Greek province of Macedonia.
The consensus among historians and intellectuals on both sides of the border
is that Vardar Macedonia, named after the river that flows through Skopje,
the Macedonian capital, would suffice.
A draft Security Council resolution, put forward by Britain, France and
Spain, tries to set the framework for a settlement by proposing that
Macedonia should join the UN under the temporary name of Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia.
Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, co-chairmen of the Yugoslav peace process,
have agreed to oversee the arbitration procedure. Efforts would be made to
introduce confidence-building measures, some of which have already been
agreed in previous attempts by the EC to resolve the dispute.
The Macedonians would drop their propaganda campaign aimed at convincing
outsiders that northern Greece belongs to a Greater Macedonia. The Greeks
would provide economic aid and a border guarantee for Macedonia.
Macedonia's near-isolation has caused a sharp economic decline, with GDP
shrinking 14 per cent in 1992, and unemployment rising to over 20 per cent
of the workforce. A Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.5m) loan from Mr George Soros,
the international financier, to cover fuel purchases and essential imports,
is now keeping the economy afloat.
Joining the UN, even under a temporary name, would bring recognition from
Macedonia's trading partners, enabling banks in Skopje to start borrowing
abroad again. Membership would also speed up financial aid from
international organisations. Macedonia has already joined the International
Monetary Fund with the prefix of 'Former Yugoslav Republic', assuming
responsibility for its 5.4 per cent share of the ex-Yugoslav debt, amounting
to Dollars 11m.
While withholding recognition for Macedonia, because of Greek objections,
the EC has pledged Ecu100m (Pounds 81m) aid, much of it to be delivered
through the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki, Macedonia's closest outlet
to the sea.
Most Greek politicians now accept Macedonia will soon be recognised under
that name, Mr Mitsotakis' attempts at conciliation over the Macedonia
question have angered the nationalists in his own New Democracy party as
much as opposition socialists.
Mr Kiro Gligorev, Macedonian president, faces pressure from the hardline
faction in the VMRO party, the largest group in parliament, not to accept a
temporary name. But he knows that if Macedonia joins the UN with the interim
name, it will probably not be hard to drop the prefix at a later date.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Guinness saga ends as Ward is cleared of theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE GUINNESS affair
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the first of several recent scandals to traumatise the City - finally came
to an end yesterday with the acquittal of Mr Thomas Ward. Mr Ward, the US
lawyer who advised the company on its 1986 takeover of Distillers, was found
not guilty of the theft of Pounds 5.2m at London's Old Bailey.
In stark contrast to the highly public spectacle of the first Guinness
trial, which left an indelible imprint on City attitudes and behaviour,
nobody was in the public gallery and just a handful of reporters were
present.
After Mr Ward's five-week trial, the jury took six and a half hours to reach
a unanimous verdict of not guilty. Mr Ward, standing in the dock, called
across the courtroom to the jury: 'Thank God - thank you all.'
He criticised his prosecution as 'misconceived' and insisted he had no
regrets about his role in the infamous takeover. 'I regret what has
happened, but I don't regret the contribution I made to Guinness,' he said,
adding that he intended to resume his career as a corporate lawyer in the
US.
For the Serious Fraud Office, the verdict marks a disappointing end to its
series of prosecutions over the Guinness affair, which was its first major
challenge. The first trial resulted in the jailing of Mr Ernest Saunders,
the company's former chief executive, Mr Gerald Ronson, the Heron chairman,
and the stockbroker Mr Anthony Parnes. Mr Jack Lyons, the financier, was
fined Pounds 3m.
Mr Ward, however, is the only defendant in the Guinness trials to be
acquitted by a jury. The second trial - of Mr Roger Seelig and Lord Spens -
collapsed before a verdict could be reached.
During the Ward trial, the prosecution had alleged that Mr Ward had stolen
the Pounds 5.2m from Guinness in a joint enterprise with Mr Saunders. The
Pounds 3m Mr Ward later deposited into Mr Saunders' Swiss bank account was
the former Guinness chief executive's share of the spoils, the prosecution
alleged.
However, lawyers for Mr Ward argued that the payment was a US-style 'success
fee' for his work in reversing the bid's referral to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission and in obtaining the prior agreement of Distillers to
meet Guinness's costs for the takeover.
The Pounds 3m transferred to Mr Saunders' account - a central theme in Mr
Saunders' own trial - belonged to Mr Ward, they insisted. The US lawyer had
placed the money there to meet his tax bills, they argued.
After yesterday's verdict, the trial judge, Mr Justice Turner told the jury:
'In my respectful opinion, you have done as much as any jury could in this
case.' They would be excused serving on a jury again for 10 years, he told
them.
The judge said he would use today's hearing to decide costs issues and to
make some further comments about the handling of complex fraud trials.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Government backs away from row over Maastricht: Hurd says
defeat would not stop ratification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday made an embarrassing about-turn as it sought to
limit the damage in the latest confrontation over its European policy. It
declared that new legal advice meant that a defeat in parliament over the
social chapter would still allow it to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
Amid rowdy scenes in the House of Commons, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, made the embarrassing and unexpected admission that the previous
legal interpretation provided by Foreign Office lawyers had been mistaken.
The new advice has come from Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general.
Facing derision from the opposition and anger from some Tory Euro-rebels, Mr
Hurd apologised to MPs as he explained that the government had wrongly
advised the Commons when it said that passing the controversial Labour
amendment on the social chapter would wreck the treaty. 'I regret that the
legal advice then given to the House was not correct,' he said.
Many at Westminster saw the turn-about as a manoeuvre intended to save the
government from humiliating defeat in the vote in a few weeks' time. There
were already signs last night that it had taken some heat out of the issue,
with Tory Euro-rebels divided over whether to vote against the government if
the amendment was meaningless.
Mr Hurd said the government would still oppose the amendment, but added: 'If
the amendment were carried, it would have no effect on our ability to ratify
the treaty.' There was opposition mockery as he said that it was 'for the
sake of completeness and tidiness' that the social protocol should be
incorporated into domestic law.
The new legal advice draws a sharp line between changes to the bill which
would make UK law incompatible with the treaty, making it impossible for
Britain to ratify, and those which would not affect ratification.
The government now says that since the social protocol, which the amendment
would exclude from the bill, does not apply to the UK because of the
'opt-out', Labour's proposed change falls into the second category.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, was scathing about the
backtracking. Accusing the government of putting expediency above principle,
he said there was 'confusion and disarray in government circles' because of
ministers' determination not to accept the social chapter. The new stance
made the weeks of detailed debate at Westminster a charade, he said.
Mr Cunningham said that Labour would still press the amendment to a vote,
and Labour is also working on how to devise a further amendment which would
be effective in forcing the government to choose between accepting the
social chapter and abandoning the treaty.
Yesterday's change of tack came after Mr Hurd had asked the attorney-general
whether he agreed with the advice from Foreign Office lawyers presented to
the Commons by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the Foreign Office minister, in last
month's debate on the social chapter.
Since that debate it had become clear that support for Labour's amendment 27
to the bill was widespread enough to jeopardise the government's majority of
21. The amendment united opposition MPs, who believed it would lead to the
UK's adoption of the social chapter, with Tory Euro-sceptics who believed it
would scupper ratification.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Radiation leak at Sellafield 'serious but within limits'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RADIATION LEAK at the Sellafield nuclear site last week, believed to be
the first since 1986, was described yesterday as 'serious' by the
government, although it added that radioactivity levels were 'well within
safety limits'.
Since last Wednesday one of the main chimneys on British Nuclear Fuel's site
had discharged more than five times the amount of radioactivity that it
normally discharged in a whole year, Mr David Maclean, environment minister,
said yesterday in an emergency statement in the Commons.
However, he added that the release of 1,000 megabecquerels of radioactivity
was less than a quarter of the site's current authorised limits of 4,300MBq
a year. BNF said last night that monitoring since the weekend showed that
discharges had fallen to 20MBq a day.
The latest incident follows an internal leak last year when no radiation is
believed to have escaped into the air. It comes at a sensitive time for BNF,
which is waiting for the pollution inspectorate to approve new discharge
limits, including those for BNF's controversial new Thorp reprocessing
plant. Last week's discharges would have breached the terms of the proposed
new licence by around 50 per cent, according to Mr Simon Hughes, Liberal
Democrat environment spokesman.
BNF was still unclear last night about the cause of the leak in Building
203, a now disused plant for reprocessing nuclear fuel. Particles of alpha
radiation escaped through a ventilation system to the central chimney stack
on Building 204 at the heart of the site.
BNF found that levels of alpha radiation had risen at 3pm last Thursday when
the monitoring device attached to the chimney stack, which is changed every
day for testing, was removed.
Mr Maclean said yesterday that he was concerned about the time it took for
the incident to to be reported to the inspectorates, which were not told
until 4pm on Friday. BNF declined to say on Friday how much radiation had
been emitted.
Mr Maclean said a full investigation by the pollution and nuclear
installations inspectorates and the agriculture ministry was under way and
the results would be published. He told the Commons that, on the basis of
pessimistic estimates, the increase in dose to the public close to the plant
was less than  1/2 per cent of the annual average dose in the UK.
Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary whose constituency covers
the plant, said: 'It is unacceptable that one quarter of the annual
authorisation of particular radio nucleids should be discharged in just a
24-hour period.' He complained that he had not been told of the incident
when he visited the plant on Thursday and Friday of last week. BNF said it
sent him a facsimile late on Friday.
Greenpeace, the campaign group, said yesterday: 'If this is how BNF behave
under the existing licences, how can we trust them under the new ones?'

FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banks consider Heron proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL proposals on a Pounds 1.4bn debt refinancing plan to rescue Heron,
the property and trading group, have been sent for approval to the 82 banks
involved after an agreement to recommend the proposals among Heron's lead
banks.
The banks have to approve the final documentation by the end of this month
if Heron is to continue to meet its obligations. After bank approval, the
company's bondholders will be consulted.
The pressure on banks and bondholders to reach a speedy settlement was
increased by Heron's decision earlier this month to stop paying fees it
regards as not essential to achieving its restructuring.
Final proposals were sent out to Heron's banks about 10 days ago after the
banks' steering committee, led by Barclays, agreed the documentation. The
process of refinancing was originally started last March.
The banks had already given approval to the first outline of the refinancing
proposals when this was made in October, but since then there has been
extensive work on drawing up detailed final proposals for their approval.
Under the October proposal, banks and bondholders which lent Pounds 775m to
Heron's head office group are being offered Pounds 400m in equity, Pounds
300m in senior debt maturing in March 1997, and Pounds 75m in junior debt
expiring in 2000.
Banks which lent to other parts of the group will be repaid in cash from
disposal proceeds over periods up to 1997. The banks are being asked to put
in Pounds 20m of capital.
Unless the refinancing is completed, Heron would go into receivership. The
company itself set a deadline of the end of February for the refinancing to
establish fresh terms on which the holding company can trade.
Bondholders are expected to be offered detailed terms similar to the banks
which have a small exposure.

FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Noranda turns round to profit of
CDollars 79m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORANDA, the resources group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, shook
off lower commodity prices to return to profitability last year.
Net earnings were CDollars 79m, (USDollars 62.2) or 10 cents a share,
compared to a CDollars 133m loss, equal to CDollars 1.04 a share, in 1991.
Revenues rose to CDollars 8.64bn from CDollars 8.46bn.
The fourth quarter saw a meagre profit of CDollars 4m, compared to a
CDollars 109m loss a year earlier.
Noranda buttressed its balance sheet last week by selling a controlling
interest in MacMillan Bloedel, the Vancouver-based forestry group for
CDollars 971m. Proceeds from the sale will be received in three almost-equal
instalments over the next two years.
Noranda predicted that favourable currency and interest rates should produce
some improvement in earnings and cash flows this year. But it painted a
sombre picture of prospects in its main markets, noting that a pick-up in
demand for some its products has been more than matched by supplies from
eastern Europe.
The improved 1992 financial performance was largely due to a 16 per cent
drop in interest charges, the impact of a lower Canadian dollar on export
earnings and cost reductions.

FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Happy to net a good return / A
preview of the David Lloyd flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Lloyd is expecting to bring his rapidly growing chain of
tennis-based sports centres to the market early next month in a flotation he
hopes will value the company at Pounds 50m.
Ten years after launching his first club in Heston, the former Davis Cup
tennis player and oldest brother in one of Britain's most successful tennis
families, is to attempt to serve his most lucrative ace.
Fired by a dearth of facilities, Mr Lloyd returned from running tennis
centres in North America and set up his first David Lloyd Club in 1982.
Since then six more clubs have been opened, membership has risen to 33,000
and profits have climbed sharply. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 625,000
in 1990 to Pounds 3m in the year to September 1992 and sales have more than
doubled to Pounds 15m.
Almost from the beginning, Mr Lloyd tweaked the formula so that today the
seven centres are really fitness clubs -  that include gyms, squash courts,
swimming pools, creches and restaurants -  centred around covered tennis
courts.
One benefit of the Lloyd formula is strong cash flow. So far, the centres
have all been profitable in their first year. The trick is to ensure that
the 20 per cent of members who drop out each year are rapidly replaced by
new members and new signing on fees.
Opening new centres also ensures a low tax rate -  about 10 per cent - as
the company takes advantage of capital allowances. Mr Lloyd believes local
authorities are more willing to grant planning permission in favourable
locations, because the facilities are offered to local communities and
schools.
The decision to go public lies partly with Leisure Holdings, the Irish
investor which owns 72 per cent of the equity and wants an exit. But Mr
Lloyd is also keen to expand more quickly. 'The market is totally
under-developed,' he says. 'From cash flow, bank facilities and the proceeds
of the float we can open two facilities a year.'
Advisers say that a float valuing the company at Pounds 50m would raise
about Pounds 11m, reducing gearing from about 80 per cent at the last
balance sheet date to below 20 per cent. Leisure Holdings, which is selling
all its stake, would receive more than Pounds 36m.
Mr Lloyd, who put all his investments into the first venture where he ran
most of the club, including the kitchen and the bar, would retain 10 per
cent of the company. No doubt this is one return Mr Lloyd is happy to net.

FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Swiss Bank lends support to
Trafalgar cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS Bank Corporation has emerged as the mysterious sub-underwriter of more
than 40 per cent of Trafalgar House's Pounds 204.5m rights issue, announced
on Thursday.
It was able to take up this position because of an option agreement with
Hongkong Land, the Jardine Matheson-controlled property company which has a
20.1 per cent stake in Trafalgar. The agreement allows it to sell more than
70m Trafalgar shares to Hongkong Land at a price of 79p. This is
substantially above the rights issue price of 60p.
The resulting profit of about Pounds 14m would offset losses incurred by
Swiss Bank if the rights issue flopped and it was forced to take additional
shares onto its own book.
The arrangement for Hongkong Land to buy further shares from Swiss Bank at
85p was a crucial factor behind the timing of the rights issue. Trafalgar
House needed the extra capital to avoid the danger of breaching borrowing
covenants. It said last week it expects to make a further Pounds 120m in
provisions this year to cover both restructuring and the dwindling value of
its commercial property portfolio.
Robert Fleming, which helped put together the option agreement, underwrote
the 79.9 per cent of the rights issue not accounted for by Hongkong Land.
Less than half of that amount was sub-underwritten in the market.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Ghost still haunts politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE shadow of the Banco Ambrosiano, which collapsed in 1982, has returned to
haunt Italian politics, Robert Graham writes.
The first victim has been Mr Claudio Martelli, who was forced to resign as
justice minister and hand in his membership of the Socialist party. Mr
Martelli had earlier been told that Milan magistrates were investigating him
for involvement in the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano.
Mr Martelli has denied any involvement and says he intends to fight to clear
his name. One of the six warrants of investigation sent to Mr Craxi by Milan
magistrates also concerns the bankruptcy of Ambrosiano.
Why should the collapse of a bank 11 years ago have such relevance to the
present wave of investigations into political corruption? In brief,
magistrates believe unlocking some of the unknown secrets of Ambrosiano  -
especially through access to Swiss bank accounts -  will shed light on the
complex system of illicit party financing which was perfected in Italy
during the 1980s.
Of particular interest to the magistrates is a bank account held with UBS in
Lugano in the name of Mr Silvano Larini. They are looking into the
circumstances of Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.6m) paid to this account, No 633369,
by Mr Roberto Calvi, the head of Banco Ambrosiano who was found hanged from
London's Blackfriars Bridge in 1982 just before the bank's collapse.
The magistrates allege the money was in recompense for ENI, the state oil
concern, having extended a Dollars 50m loan to help the troubled Banco
Ambrosiano. At the time of Ambrosiano's collapse, ENI had Dollars 160m loans
extended to this bank with close links to the Vatican.
The warrants against Mr Craxi and Mr Martelli, seeking the waiver of
parliamentary immunity, focus on allegations that the two were involved in
using the UBS account to receive the Calvi funds for the Socialist party.
Both politicians have denied such involvement.
Magistrates have known about this secret account for more than a decade
since it appeared in documents found when searching for Mr Licio Gelli, the
disgraced head of the powerful masonic lodge, P2.
Only recently, the account was discovered to be in the name of Mr Silvano
Larini, a Milan architect and close friend of Mr Craxi. Mr Larini was last
year found to be a key figure in the Socialist illicit money-collecting
network and an arrest warrant was issued for alleged corruption. He managed
to escape but last Sunday he handed himself over to magistrates after being
on the run for eight months.
According to Milan magistrates, he has subsequently confirmed the Swiss bank
account was in his name and he had allowed it to be used to handle the
Dollars 7m which came in two tranches from Calvi.
Independent confirmation of Mr Larini's account of these illicit funds was
also sought last week by Milan magistrates when they interviewed another
mysterious player in the Ambrosiano episode -  Mr Florio Fiorini. At the
time of the ENI loans to Ambrosiano, Mr Fiorini was finance director of the
state oil concern. He is now in a Swiss jail on charges relating to the
fraudulent bankruptcy of his finance group Sasea.

Japanese finance minister Yoshiro Hayashi yesterday said he had told
President Clinton in Washington that the dollar must not plunge because it
is a key global currency, Reuter adds.
Mr Hayashi noted that in theory, a sharp decline in the dollar's value could
undermine the stable world economy and cause inflation in the US.
Mr Hayashi said Mr Clinton told him that sound US and Japanese economies
should have a good impact and called for closer bilateral ties.

Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, has opened the way for
a compromise in Greece's dispute with Macedonia over the former Yugoslav
republic's choice of name, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
Mr Mitsotakis told regional officials of his New Democracy party at the
weekend that Greek interests would not be damaged if its neighbour kept the
name Macedonia in a form that differentiated it from the northern Greek
province of Macedonia.
Greece has blocked international recognition for Macedonia for the past
year, claiming that the name implied a territorial claim on Greek Macedonia.
Until now, Mr Mitsotakis has rejected proposals for a composite name, such
as 'north Macedonia,' put forward by EC mediators.

<TEXT>
CROSS-CHANNEL ferry operators P&amp;O European Ferries and Sealink Stena Line
will today ask the government for permission to join forces on the
Dover-Calais route.
They want to keep their identities but pool resources to present a united
front against the Channel tunnel, due to open at the end of this year.
The ferry companies believe their best chance of surviving the competition
is to co-ordinate their timetables, prices and booking systems and to
rationalise capacity.
When the two companies last proposed a pooling arrangement on the short sea
routes in 1989 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission concluded that an
agreement would act against the public interest. However, Mr Nicholas
Ridley, then trade and industry secretary, said it would be open to the
parties to make a fresh approach to the Office of Fair Trading closer to the
tunnel's opening.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Level of executive pay-offs declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXECUTIVES made redundant last year could expect to receive pay-offs
equivalent to 89 per cent of one month's salary for every year of service,
according to Drake Beam Morin, outplacement consultants.
This was down from 93 per cent of a month's salary for each year in 1991,
and a 13 percentage point drop since 1989 when the average payment was 102
per cent of a month's pay. For an executive earning Pounds 40,000 with 10
years' service, this is a fall of just under Pounds 5,000 in the final sum.
Mr Peter Trigg, managing director of the consultants, said the reduction in
redundancy packages was part of overall cost-cutting by companies. Even so,
UK executives were considerably better off than many of their Continental
and US colleagues, he said.
Executives in Finland, Germany and the US are paid about two weeks salary
for each year of service.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Legislative programme faces cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's business managers are preparing for a clampdown on the
amount of legislation being planned for the next session.
Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, and the government whips are
getting ready to warn ministers that some controversial bills will have to
be rejected to avoid overloading the programme.
The government's managers believe the impact of having to deal with an
overall majority of only 21 has not been recognised in ministers'
legislative plans, partly because it has been obscured by the peculiar
circumstances of the Maastricht bill this session.
They also believe that the move to a unified Budget and spending statement
in December could have an adverse impact on the programme. There is a danger
that unless the new session starts early in November, the combination of a
week's debate on the Queen's speech at the start of the session followed by
a week-long debate on the Budget will delay discussion of individual bills.
Officials in the Cabinet Office are holding meetings with departments to try
to weed out some of the more unlikely bills before ministers have a
preliminary discussion of the programme, probably later this month. The main
departmental bids include:
A banking bill, proposed by the Treasury, mainly to take account of
recommendations in the wake of the Bingham inquiry into the BCCI collapse.
Legislation to reform agricultural landlord and tenant law.
A comprehensive 'green' bill, urged by Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary. It would set up a unified environmental protection agency and
might include provisions to introduce market instruments such as tradeable
permits. But as departments have to bid for numbers of clauses as well as
the number of bills, the government's business managers may try to cut its
size.
A pensions bill proposed by the social security department. It would deal
with the equalisation of the pension age and changes to occupational
pensions law recommended by the Goode committee.
A bill to deregulate London buses. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary,
may press for provisions to make local authorities sell their airports, if
too few of them do so voluntarily.
For Scotland, the main legislation would be to implement the government's
decisions on water privatisation and re-organising local government. A bill
from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to privatise
British Coal. He also wants a bill to simplify the law on trademarks and one
to reform restrictive practices and trades description law.
Two bills from Mr John Patten, the education secretary. One would reform
teacher training, making the courses more classroom-based, and another make
membership of the National Union of Students voluntary. A bill to put the
security and intelligence services on a statutory footing.
A handful of bills from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary. A police bill
and reform of the Sunday trading law are the main elements, but he is also
pressing for a criminal justice bill.
If he fails to persuade his colleagues that the bill on the boundary changes
to take account of the extra six seats for the European elections should be
dealt with in the current session, that will be a priority for the next
legislative programme.

French labour minister Martine Aubry yesterday called for the working week
to be cut by two hours in 1996 as a way of reducing unemployment, an issue
dominating the run-up to parliamentary elections next month, Reuter reports
from Paris.
'It is inevitable,' Ms Aubry told Sunday's Journal du Dimanche newspaper.
'Let's propose, for example, a first stage to 37 hours a week in 1996, with
negotiations from now until then on how it should be done.' Ms Aubry said
people would have to take pay cuts but these should spare the lowest paid
workers.
Unemployment in France stands at 10.5 per cent of the workforce, or nearly
3m.
A conservative opposition alliance is widely expected to defeat the ruling
Socialists in voting on March 21 and 28.

There was some speculation in Caracas that the pact may be an effort to

American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
The G3 presidents and the chief executives of six central American states
also called for a free trade area, by July 1 1993, between G3 members and
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.
Mr Carlos Andrea Perez, president of Venezuela, said that Caribbean nations

G3 and central American governments. The G3, founded in 1989, plans to hold
its next presidential summit in Guatemala in January 1994.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Complaints force banknote redesign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 5, Pounds 10 and Pounds 20 banknotes are to be redesigned so that
people can tell them apart more easily, the Bank of England said yesterday.
The move follows a wave of complaints from people who find it hard to
distinguish the new designs of notes because they are smaller and less
colourful than earlier ones.
The Bank disclosed plans to make the numerals more prominent following a
suggestion in the House of Lords that taxi drivers have been given a new
source of income by the ease with which passengers confuse the notes.
The Bank will start by issuing a new version of the Pounds 5 note from March
1. The Pounds 5 symbol at the top left of the note will be changed to dark
green from light blue to make it stand out against the pale pink background.
Similar changes to Pounds 10 and Pounds 20 notes, which were introduced as
part of the Bank's new Series E currency in 1991 and 1992, will follow this
year. The Bank issues series of notes only once every 20 years, and tries to
avoid interim changes.
The Bank said yesterday it had received a growing number of complaints about
the new notes. They were printed in paler colours in order to make forgery
harder.
The notes prompted a debate in the House of Lords at the end of last year,
during which peers complained that cash transactions were being delayed
because people now had to spend a long time examining their notes.
The Bank said numerals had not been made very prominent because its research
for the design of the new currency series had found that people generally
identified banknotes by their size, shape and colour rather than currency
symbols.
The fact that it was hard to see the symbol on the Pounds 5 note did not
attract much attention when it was issued in 1990, but the issue of the
Pounds 10 and Pounds 20 notes added to confusion. The new Pounds 50 note
will be adjusted before issue in 1994.
The Bank said the 198m Pounds 5 notes now in circulation would gradually be
withdrawn after March 1.
The Bank originally considered making the notes in the series the same size,
as well as less distinctively coloured.
It changed its mind after representations from organisations for the blind,
but nonetheless reduced the size of the notes.
The smaller reduction in sizes combined with the paler colours meant people
had to rely more on the currency symbols.
An official said that the notes had been designed in paler 'washed-out'
colour patterns because advances in photocopiers meant that brighter
coloured notes would have been easier for forgers to copy using the latest
high quality colour photocopiers.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Opec close to deal on output cuts and support for prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN AGREEMENT by ministers of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to cut output in the second quarter of the year and shore up oil
prices was believed to be close last night.
The ministers, meeting in Vienna, were making 'very satisfactory progress',
according to Mr Alirio Parra, the Opec president, who said he expected a
final deal today.
The talks centre around a Saudi Arabian proposal for members to make pro
rata cuts amounting to 1m barrels a day from Opec's first quarter ceiling of
24.58m b/d agreed in November.
Most delegations have agreed to the cuts, but a decision was being stalled
by Kuwait's strong resistance.
The Gulf state declared that it was unhappy with the level of cuts that
fellow members believe it must make if the cartel is to satisfy the markets.
Mr Ali al-Baghli, the Kuwaiti oil minister, last night held a series of
bilateral meetings to try to narrow the differences with other Opec members,
which have been exerting pressure on the emirate to agree to cut production
in proportion with themselves.
The Saudi formula would, if the cartel were to show uncharacteristic
discipline and obey its own ceiling, actually take nearer to 1.5m b/d off
the oil market, given that most estimates by the industry put Opec output
for the present quarter at more than 25m b/d.
To attain that, members would be expected to cut output pro rata from their
production figures of November last year. At that point Kuwait was lifting
around 1.5m b/d.
The Gulf state, however, has insisted that it did not receive a quota as
such in November and anyway should be regarded as a special case while it is
still rebuilding after the damage done by the Gulf war.
Kuwiat claims its present production to be around 1.98m b/d which would rise
to 2.1m b/d in the second quarter, and wants any cuts to be considered only
from this level.
Other delegations, and many industry specialists, believe a present Kuwaiti
production figure of around 1.7-1.8m b/d to be more credible.
Some delegations, including Saudi Arabia, argue that Opec cannot deliver a
believable output cut while allowing Kuwait such leeway. The kingdom itself
is refusing to cut its production below 8m b/d from its present 8.4m b/d.
In addition, patience has worn thin among other delegations for Kuwait's
call for special treatment.
'Every country has got economic problems,' said one Nigerian delegate. 'The
fact that we did not have a war does not mean we don't have economic
problems.'
Neither do many Opec countries want to make too much of a precedent for
special treatment with the prospect of Iraq's re-entry on to the oil market
looming, albeit fairly distantly, on the horizon.
Anything less than a unanimous agreement to cut production to somewhere near
23.5m b/d, and corresponding discipline in meeting the target, is likely to
disappoint the markets, which have built between Dollars 1.50 and Dollars 2
into the price of crude before this weekend's meeting on the back of
apparent consensus to cut at least 1m b/d from the November ceiling.
By late yesterday, however, 23.5m b/d looked an optimistic target, with some
members suggesting that Kuwait might at the outside be accommodated at a
production level of perhaps 1.6m b/d or slightly more  - which, if accepted,
would already represent leakage on the November Opec ceiling.
Some Gulf Arab delegations suggested the final agreement might be closer to
a ceiling of 23.6-23.7m b/d.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Monday Interview: France's comeback kid - Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, former French president, talks to David Buchan and William
Dawkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since he was ousted from the Elysee presidential palace in 1981, at the
relatively tender age of 55, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing has been trying to
claw his way back. His chances seemed slim, until last autumn's Maastricht
referendum campaign gave him a second wind.
The question is how far this second wind will carry him. To the prime
minister's office if, in next month's parliamentary elections, his Union
pour la Democratie Francaise (UDF) becomes the largest component in the
probable new conservative government? Or even back to the Elysee, if Mr
Giscard d'Estaing can keep up the momentum until the 1995 presidential
contest? Rocking back on one of the gilt chairs in his stately Paris house,
Mr Giscard d'Estaing laughingly dismisses any suggestions that he is a
political has-been.
He was almost the only leader to emerge with political credit from the
battle for Maastricht. Co-founder (with Helmut Schmidt) of the European
Monetary System during his time in the Elysee and keen member of the
European Parliament since, he put heart and soul into the Maastricht
campaign, and may have tipped the balance in the treaty's favour.
Yet the real importance of the Maastricht campaign to Mr Giscard d'Estaing
was psychological. It gave him back a political gusto he had not shown since
his successful 1974 run for the presidency. And it put him back into serious
contention with his long-time rival on the right of French politics, Mr
Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullist RPR party, to succeed Mr Francois
Mitterrand.
This rivalry faces France with a double 'cohabitation' in government over
the next two years, and promises to make French politics especially volatile
over that period.
'The real question is not who is going to win (in March),' says Mr Giscard
d'Estaing. All the opinion polls point to a landslide for a centre-right
government which will have to cohabit with the Socialist president, Mr
Mitterrand, whose second term has two more years to run. 'The real question
is what are we going to do with our victory.'
This will be largely determined by how the UDF and RPR, which have reached
non-aggression pacts in 496 of the National Assembly's 577 constituencies,
cohabit in government. Despite agreeing to field a joint candidate in most
constituencies, it is vital to the UDF and RPR to beat each other in March.
President Mitterrand has indicated he will appoint as prime minister the
leader of the party that makes the strongest showing in seats.
'I am not a candidate' for the prime ministership, says Mr Giscard d'Estaing
aloofly. But some UDF deputies have suggested that their leader would be
happy to move into the Hotel Matignon, the prime minister's house. Mr
Giscard d'Estaing says: 'My role is to get the maximum number of candidates
elected -  personal questions will follow later.'
This cageyness is not just the pride of someone who, having once been number
one, does not want to appear to be scrambling to be number two. Mr Giscard
d'Estaing says that cohabitation could be even more dangerous for the
opposition than it was in 1986, when Mr Chirac became prime minister only to
be soundly defeated in the 1988 presidential election by Mr Mitterrand.
True, Mr Mitterrand will not stand again. But, says Mr Giscard d'Estaing,
'the economic situation which was relatively easy in 1986-88 is now worse .
. . The reform of the common agricultural policy has been badly managed from
the viewpoint of French interests . . . while the majority (for the
opposition) will probably be much bigger.' Parliamentary discipline will
therefore be more lax than in 1986-88 when the centre-right sometimes had a
majority of only three. 'Will the new government have the margin of
manoeuvre to take the strong measures needed?' he queries. He doubts it,
because of the divisions that bedevil the right in France.
'I suffered as president from the absence of a united centre-right party in
France,' says Mr Giscard d'Estaing. He finds this absence all the more
curious 'when the political culture of France is basically of the
centre-right. French people are for a market economy but one with a social
conscience . . . They are not free-market fundamentalists.' But this
centre-right majority remains split, he says, by the legacy of General De
Gaulle and by the electoral system. Two rounds of voting, with the first
round functioning a little like a US primary election, tend to 'divide the
parties', he says.
But this gulf -  between the populist-nationalist RPR and the UDF, which is
more conservative on economics but more progressive on social issues -  is
beyond Mr Giscard d'Estaing's power, and maybe inclination, to heal. He
claims 'honestly, the press has exaggerated' the personal frost between
himself and Mr Chirac. 'He was my prime minister (1974-76), and we worked in
conditions that were not at all bad. Certainly, there were differences of
culture and temperament, but these were not greater than exist within the
British Conservative party or between the CDU and CSU parties in Germany.'
However, the two leaders of the opposition keep their meetings to an
absolute minimum, studiously avoiding each other, for instance, throughout
the Maastricht campaign. When Mr Giscard d'Estaing claims his UDF is in tune
with the national mood, he makes a contrast as much with the Gaullists as
with the Socialists. 'People want a clear change, but not intolerance. They
want improvement of the country, but not authoritarianism. They are
preoccupied by certain aspects of European construction, but remained
attached to a European Union.'
With much fanfare, the RPR and UDF last week announced a common platform on
which they will fight the March election under the banner of the Union Pour
la France (UPF). The 22-page document is a considerable negotiating
achievement, reflecting in part the opposition's general desperation to see
off the Socialists. Mr Giscard d'Estaing admits that it merely papers over
certain differences between the two opposition parties.
Some of these differences concern the detail, but not the principle, of
privatisation, social charges and tax incentives for job creation. Others
have roots going back to the French revolution. The UDF has a 'Girondin'
preference for devolving power to the regions that is anathema to the
centralising 'Jacobin' in many a Gaullist. Not surprisingly, the UDF was the
first to produce a draft statute to make the Banque de France independent of
government.
Significantly, too, the ex-president also wants to change the presidency
itself. He would like to see presidential terms cut from seven to five years
and made to coincide with parliamentary elections. Would not that reduce the
president's powers? 'Yes -  these powers are a bit excessive,' Mr Giscard
d'Estaing says from personal experience.
More important, simultaneous elections would make it unlikely that voters
would choose presidents and government of different parties. 'At present,
France runs on a kind of two-stroke motor -  first one system for five
years, then another for a further two years and so on.'
Four years' membership of the relatively powerless European Parliament has
made him more sympathetic to boosting the clout of France's national
assembly, the weakest national legislature in Europe. 'Once Maastricht is
ratified, there won't be a great deal left to do (in Strasbourg),' he says.
To implement economic and monetary union, 'one can do more in France', he
adds. He hopes for Emu on the shortest timetable allowed by Maastricht, by
1997, and seems to have more or less written off Britain  - though not Italy
 - as a member of that first currency union.
Next year, says Mr Giscard d'Estaing, is decision year -  for EC states to
start preparing for Emu, and for himself to decide whether he wants to lead
France into Emu. He is coy about another presidential bid. But he concedes
that he will have to come off the fence in 1994 -  either to head the UDF
list again in next year's Euro-elections or run for the Elysee. 'That,' he
says,'will be the moment of choice.'

FT  15 FEB 93 / The voice of Euro-gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Community is once again in the throes of a crisis of
Euro-pessimism. For this assertion, we have the word of no less a figure
than Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. He told the
European Parliament last week: 'The economy is in crisis, society is in
crisis, democracy is foundering . . . The very idea of a united Europe is in
peril.'
Many people will be inclined to discount such a stark judgment as a
histrionic excess of language. No one can deny that the recession is a
source of considerable difficulty, for the Community as well as for the
member states; there is no doubt that the EC is going through a period of
considerable uncertainty in this twilight zone between the signature of
Maastricht and its ratification. But is it really true to say that
'democracy is foundering?'
Mr Delors has many powerful virtues. But he does have a tendency to react
too emotionally to the ups and downs of public affairs, and he must surely
be overstating the case.
The Community's crisis has three facets, according to Mr Delors. First,
unemployment is jeopardising the credibility of the EC's raison d'etre.
Second, popular support for the Community can no longer be taken for
granted; the voters used to accept Europe massively but passively, now they
actively debate it. Third, the same debate is going on among the EC
governments: 'Our 12 member states do not see eye to eye on the fundamental
issue of where Europe should be going,' he said.
These three factors obviously hang together. The EC has always developed
quickly under the benign influence of economic growth, and stagnated in
periods of recession: the last period of Euro-gloom lasted from the oil
shock of the early 1970s to the recovery of the early 1980s. The programme
for economic and monetary union (Emu) sprang out of the euphoria which
accompanied the 1985 plan for the single market; but it must be vulnerable
to popular condemnation if it is seen as a machine for low growth and high
unemployment. And if voters are ambivalent about it, governments will be
ambivalent too.
Mr Delors' difficulty is that he can provide no reassurance for the
doubters, because he can promise no solution for their problems. The
president remains convinced that the EMU programme is still on the right
lines; he insists there is no salvation in floating exchange rates; but he
offers no remedy which will bring down, or even stabilise, unemployment.
'The spectre of unemployment hangs over everything we have achieved.
Beginning with social protection systems and their financing,
under-employment is at the root of much of the current malaise: social
exclusion and poverty, the hopelessness of young people and the
repercussions of this on education, the financial cost of unemployment,' he
said. 'I do not claim to have the answer. Much depends on national
policies.'
These last 13 words pinpoint the dilemma, and indeed encapsulate his whole
speech. Mr Delors is by far the most impressive Commission president in the
history of the Community. He played a key role in the plan for the single
market, as well as in the programme for Emu But it appears he has nothing
more to say. His speech was advertised as the Commission's action programme
for this year; but the overall impression is of a vacuum filled with hot
air, if you'll forgive the mixed metaphor.
This is not a reproach to Mr Delors; it is just a reflection of the real
world. The idea that the Commission has a duty to lead is central to
Community ideology, and Mr Delors has lived up to that duty better than any
predecessor.
But at this stage in the EC's history, the ball is in the court of the
member governments. Only they can negotiate and perhaps alleviate the
stresses of the recession; only they can navigate the treacherous waters
between the EC and the voters.
These trade-offs are all too transparent in the election platform of
France's conservative parties, which are virtually certain of a sweeping
victory in next month's election. They say unemployment is top priority but
rigorously exclude any 'growth strategy' which would involve floating the
franc or a large fiscal stimulus. On the contrary, they undertake to do
whatever is necessary for monetary stability, including independence for the
Banque de France, and they promise a new initiative for closer monetary
co-operation with Germany.
So much for the pro-Europeans. But they also have promises for the
anti-Europeans, the xenophobes and the protectionists. They say they will
reject both the EC-US farm trade agreement and last year's reform of the EC
farm policy; they undertake to tighten up on law and order; and they promise
new restrictions on immigration and on nationality law.
But the most innovative aspect of their programme is the stress on more
devolution: more decentralised education, more powers for the regions and
the departements, more local experimentation, more local democracy.
This is a striking departure from the traditional French model, of a
centralised, universalist, Jacobin state. But it is the dual corollary of a
developing EC: only the member states can mediate the politics of the
transformation of Europe; but the transformation of Europe requires the
transformation of the member states. Member states that prefer not to change
will obviously prefer to stand aside from the transformation of Europe.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Clinton versus the special interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most pundits seem to regard President Bill Clinton's first few weeks as a
failure. In fact, through a series of speeches, trial balloons and publicity
stunts, he and his wife, Hillary, have begun to alter the terms of economic
and social debate in quite significant ways. Distractions such as the debate
over gays in the military and the prolonged (but now apparently successful)
search for a female attorney-general have obscured the shrewd way in which
the Clintons have prepared the ground for this Wednesday's crucial state of
the union address to Congress.
The principle of 'shared sacrifice', for example, already seems quite
well-established. Contrary to his campaign rhetoric, Mr Clinton knows full
well that he can reduce the deficit only by raising taxes on middle-income
families and squeezing popular programmes such as Medicare, the federal
health scheme for the elderly. He will try to make this seem politically
acceptable in two ways: by stressing that short-term sacrifice is part of a
strategy to boost growth by shifting resources from consumption to
investment, and by emphasising the plan's 'fairness'.
Starting tonight in a less formal television address, the nation will thus
hear a lot from Mr Clinton about the so-called 'investment deficit' and the
priority attached to raising spending in areas such as education, training
and infrastructure. Middle-income families will also be told that they are
being hit far less hard than other groups, such as rich individuals,
companies and the federal bureaucracy.
Mr Clinton has already announced a 25 per cent reduction in White House
staff and a 5 per cent cut in federal employment over four years. On
Wednesday he will propose a new 36 per cent top rate of income and
corporation tax, and controversial limits on the tax deductibility of high
executive salaries. The speech will be accompanied by 'burden tables'
showing that the affluent are being asked to make much the biggest
sacrifice.
The other innovative aspect of Mr Clinton's approach is his recognition that
serious economic and social reform can occur only if the influence of
special interest groups is curbed. A permanent reduction in the budget
deficit would benefit everybody because it would raise national savings and
investment and hence the long-term rate of growth. It has not happened
because interest groups, from the elderly to oil companies, oppose the
specific spending cuts and tax increases that are needed. The story on
health care is similar: private insurers oppose measures to prevent them
weeding out sick people (bad risks); drug companies and physicians oppose
controls that would reduce their incomes. Congress is subject to
round-the-clock pressure from an army of talented lobbyists.
This week's address will form part of an emerging White House strategy to
bypass Congress, special interests and the media by speaking directly to the
American people. In a televised 'townhall' meeting in Detroit last week Mr
Clinton again demonstrated his ability to empathise with voters and explain
complex issues simply. He spent an hour answering the public's questions, in
the process defining what he saw as the 'national" interest in budgetary and
social policy.
Mrs Clinton is pursuing a similar strategy in her bid to bring about the
radical reform of the US health care system. At a public meeting in
Pennsylvania, she and Tipper Gore, the vice-president's wife, took on
special interests by inviting uninsured families to discuss their medical
and financial plight on national television. Later in the week both Clintons
appeared at a clinic in Virginia and lambasted drug companies for
profiteering at the expense of children. The cost of treatment is so high
that nearly 50 per cent of two-year-olds are not vaccinated against common
diseases.
These powerful images set the scene for a call on Wednesday for the nation
to pull together in tackling common problems. Yet the message may be blurred
by Mr Clinton's apparent conviction that the economy still needs a
short-term stimulus even though it is already growing at an annual rate of
about 3 per cent. The stimulus is seen as politically invaluable because it
fulfils a campaign pledge, is insurance against any future setbacks, and
will later support Mr Clinton's claims that this is 'his recovery', rather
than a legacy from the Bush years. With luck it may prove more apparent than
real.
For example, unless delayed well into next year, several tax changes - such
as higher rates on top earners, higher taxation of pension benefits and the
expected new energy levy -  should offset the stimulative impact of the
investment tax credit and accelerated federal spending.
Mr Clinton has begun to prepare people for the sacrifices needed to reduce
the structural budget deficit. He must realise that he will never have
greater room for manoeuvre. The economy is at the beginning of an upswing.
Wall Street is in an unusually benign frame of mind. The Democratic party's
electoral mandate to 'change America' is freshly minted. If he shirks tough
measures now, he is certain to duck them as the next election draws closer.
Special interests and congressional opposition will prevent him getting
everything he asks for this week; the unforgivable mistake will be not to
ask for enough.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: The dollar dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVEN WEEKS into 1993, it is extraordinary how much uncertainty there still
is about the outlook for the dollar and the US economy, writes James Blitz.
Throughout the second half of last year, markets waited for signs of a
strong upturn in the US economy, believing that this would push the dollar
firmly upwards.
Expectations of recovery have helped to push the dollar up by nearly 30
pfennigs against the D-Mark in the last five months. But dealers are still
wondering whether the currency can go higher than DM1.67.
In its global currency outlook, NatWest Markets in London forecasts a
D-Mark/dollar rate of DM1.82 in 12 months time, well above the forward
market rate of DM1.70. Although doubts still surround the scale of the US
economic recovery, the group still expects the upward trend to remain intact
throughout the year.
However, other commentators are less sure. Last Thursday's figure for M2
money supply growth for the first week of February showed only a 0.6 per
cent increase year-on-year, a new low in the current US economic cycle.
According to Mr Mark Brett, of BZW in London, this should make dollar bulls
think again about whether the recovery is as strong as believed.
At a presentation in London last week, Mr Philip Braverman, Chief Economist
at DKB Securities in New York, was also very uncertain about whether the US
would stage a strong recovery this year.
'The US economy's essential condition over coming quarters will be slower
growth, persistent economic and financial distress, and eroding inflation,'
he said. 'That reality should produce new lows in interest rates.
The December leading indicators, due out tomorrow, will give new clues to
the economy's strength. But President Bill Clinton's State of the Union
address tomorrow will be scrutinised for his thinking on the budget deficit.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Risk and Reward: Investment managers query the value of
asset-liability models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The bonds vs equities debate is exercising pension fund trustees in a way
that few investment issues have. Fund managers are reporting an increasing
number of trustee clients -  not known for investment sophistication -
walking through the door clutching a tailor-made asset-liability model which
the investment manager is asked to follow.
The use of these models, fund managers say, has increased sharply within the
past six months, largely due to press comment suggesting that pension funds
have invested too heavily in equities.
Not surprisingly, many of these models are advising fund managers to pare
equities weightings to reduce the risk that there will not be enough money
to ensure that pension liabilities shortly falling due are met.
In fact, consultants at actuaries Mercer Fraser say, the public debate has
missed the point. The real problem is that UK pension funds have become
increasingly mature, with the number of current and deferred pensioners
dwarfing the number of active contributing members. While a young pension
scheme has a bulge of liabilities falling due far in the future, a mature
scheme faces a bulge of costs quite quickly. But the average UK balanced
pension fund pool, with its 85 per cent weighting in equities, may represent
an investment strategy which takes 10 years to come good -  too long to meet
the needs of many mature schemes, according to Mr Tim Gardiner, a consultant
there.
Mr Robert Baker, who specialises in investment consulting at Mercer Fraser,
illustrates the point with a story about a client who, as the result of
making 7,000 workers redundant in a single year, became a mature scheme
almost overnight. That scheme went from 70 per cent of members making
contributions to 35 per cent, with many of those redundancies requiring
immediate calls on the pension scheme.
Mercer Fraser devised several possible asset-mixes for the client, who
selected a middle course, paring equities holdings to roughly 60 per cent of
the portfolio from 93 per cent. However, the fund manager has been given
leeway to add value to the portfolio by shifting the equities holdings to
anywhere between 50 per cent and 70 per cent of total assets. While the
solution has not eliminated the risk that short-term liabilities will be
unmet, it has reduced it significantly. But the use of these models is
unsettling fund managers.
For their part, they hint darkly that consultants are pushing
asset-liability models on clients because they simply want the fee income.
Mr Baker says costs for a modelling study range from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds
30,000, but some fund managers report costs of up to Pounds 100,000 each.
Also, a proliferation of tailor-made asset-liability benchmarks for
different clients will make the operation of large balanced pools difficult.
The pools, which include the funds of many clients, are efficient and lower
cost to operate than segregated funds which require tailor-made
administration and reporting systems.
'One of the problems for fund mangers is that benchmarks are
client-specific,' said Mr Michael Robarts, a director of Fleming Investment
Management. 'This must reduce the number of funds that anyone can run and
still meet client needs.'
Mr Robarts says his concern about the models is that clients may not
understand them sufficiently. 'A client could end up with a performance that
is good for the benchmark but bad relative to others in the fund management
industry,' he said. Thus, in a year when equities had heavily outperformed
bonds, fund managers with high bond benchmarks in their asset-liability
model, risk incurring the wrath of a client who does not understand that it
was the model which dictated the lower level of return.
Also, there is some concern among fund managers about the quality of some of
the models. While some consulting actuaries have spent large sums developing
software systems to hypothecate portfolios under various conditions, others
have not. And too often fund managers are left in the dark about the
underlying macroeconomic or business assumptions used to devise the model.

FT  15 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Public authority sector is fast opening
up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STATES, departments, autonomous regions, municipalities, communities, cities
 - a motley procession of new public-sector credits from around Europe is
fast opening up one of the biggest new areas of the international bond
markets.
Last week, the Bank for Dutch Municipalities -  a specialist credit
institution for local and other authorities in the Netherlands -  made its
debut in the Swiss franc market, raising SFr200m. Next week, the autonomous
Spanish region of Andalucia will come to the international bond market for
the first time.
It follows hot on the heels of the Basque region and the city of Madrid,
both of which made their first appearances last year.
European borrowers like these still have a long way to go to rival the
Canadian provinces and Australian states, which remain the biggest of the
so-called 'quasi-sovereigns' in the Eurobond market (a heterogeneous
collection of public-sector entities, also known as 'sub-nationals').
Canada's provinces raised more than Dollars 7bn between them internationally
last year, with some Dollars 5.5bn accounted for by Ontario, according to
IFR Securities Data.
On Friday, Quebec stepped forward with the announcement of its first global
offering, hoping to raise at least CDollars 1bn -  apparently undaunted by
the fact that more than CDollars 6bn of bonds have already been issued in
the international market this year, much of which is reported to be still
sitting on underwriters' books.
Nor is Europe about to get its own version of the US 'muni' market, the
bustling debt marketplace for thousands of small-scale borrowers from school
to sewerage districts. Decentralisation of government may have been a
popular cause across Europe in recent years, but it hasn't got that far yet.
However, the ranks of new European credits swells by the week. Moody's, the
US rating agency, has given ratings to six regions or cities in Spain in the
last 18 months, along with five departments or regions in France.
There has also been much gossip about which of the UK local authorities will
be first back into the capital markets, following a decade-long absence.
There are several reasons for this new wave. In part it reflects a general
desire by national governments in Europe to subject local authorities to
capital market disciplines, forcing them to take a tighter control of their
finances.
Also, the quasi-sovereigns are being squeezed out of their domestic capital
markets by the growing funding needs of their national governments, forcing
them increasingly to look abroad, says Mr David Levey, head of sovereign
credit ratings at Moody's.
Political motives could also play their part. Local government borrowing
generally by-passes national government balance sheets, helping to reduce
the apparent deficits of some countries.
This could help to bring UK authorities to the capital markets: they borrow
most of their money at present from the National Works Loan Board, which
itself is funded through gilt sales.
Weaning them off the PWLB would help to ease the mounting pressure of gilt
sales.
What are investors to make of this rag-bag of new borrowers? Some
occasionally look and feel as though their credit is as good as the
nation-states of which they are a part. In practice, that may not be the
case.
'Investors have had their fingers burnt on quasi-sovereigns before,' says Mr
Hugh Corbett, head of bond research at UBS in London.
'When things go wrong, they're often more quasi than sovereign.'
The swaps fiasco in the UK, which revealed that local authorities were
acting ultra vires by dealing in the derivatives markets, alerted
international investors to look more closely at the complex legal
environment in which such entities operate. And the financial difficulties
of several French cities in recent years, most prominently Anguoleme, have
underlined the credit risk.
Implicit guarantees from national governments need close scrutiny, say bond
market specialists -  along with the revenue-raising powers of authorities,
and any limitations on borrowing.
But for investors looking for a yield pick-up over sovereign bonds, the
public authority market could yet prove one of the biggest new areas around.

FT  15 FEB 93 / UK Gilts: Lowest RPI for 25 years sparks price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By  DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILTS gained ground on the back of good UK inflation data though shorter
dated bonds were held back by indications of no immediate government plans
to cut interest rates to lift recovery prospects.
News on Friday that the year-on-year increase in the Retail Prices Index in
January was just 1.7 per cent, the lowest for 25 years, sparked a price rise
for long dated bonds of up to 2 points on the day.
In spite of assurances by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that the
government saw little room for a cut in interest rates, many in financial
markets believe a cut from 6 per cent to 5 per cent will emerge in about a
month's time. The most likely date, according to City opinion, is around
Budget day on March 16.
For the week as a whole, yields fell by about 10 basis points for bonds
above the 10-year mark. Yields for 10-year bonds fell back to slightly under
8 per cent from about 8.1 per cent at the end of the previous week, while at
the 5-year level the yield reduction was only of the order of five basis
points.
Attention focused on the speech in Frankfurt by Mr Eddie George, deputy
governor of the Bank of England, who steps up to governor in July, in which
he gave a stern warning that the government was unlikely to take risks with
inflation with an early cut in base rates.
The address was a robust effort to reassure the City about the principles Mr
George intends to use in guiding monetary policy when giving advice to the
Treasury. However, it failed to give more than a modest lift to the pound
and to damp speculation that the pressures to stimulate economic recovery
would lead the government into a reduction in borrowing costs before long.
Mr Ifty Islam, a bond analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said: 'He hasn't
made much impression on me. Whatever the Bank of England says we are all
thinking another base rate cut is likely soon.'
Supporting this argument is that the inflation data during the week showed
that the demand in the UK remains fragile, and that the extra cost pressures
arising from sterling's devaluation last autumn so far are not working their
way through into the price of goods at the retail level.
However, data on purchases by manufacturers of energy and raw materials
showed that these costs rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent in
January, compared with December, largely because of higher import prices. If
that trend continues, it is likely that the government's target of keeping
underlying inflation, as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage costs, at a
year-on-year rate of 4 per cent or less will be exceeded within the next 12
months.
Mr Sanjay Joshi, an economist at Japanese securities house Daiwa, thinks
that inflationary pressures will remain subdued until the end of the first
half of this year. He reckons the headline inflation rate as measured by the
RPI will sink as low as 1.25 per cent by around May or June with the
underlying rate coming down to 2.75 per cent from the level of 3.2 per cent
in January.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Bank ponders ways to lighten funding burden: Bond stripping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is no secret that the Bank of England has a tough job ahead of it, with
an estimated Pounds 50bn of gilt issues to carry out during the next
financial year. It is no surprise then that the Bank is sounding out the
gilt market for ideas as to how it might lighten the funding burden -
including the development of a gilt strip market along the lines seen in the
US, and to a lesser extent in some European markets.
The development of a gilt strip market, involving the separation of a gilt
into its coupon and principal repayment, would help to extend demand for the
bonds, leading to an increase in prices and to a reduction in the cost of
servicing the national debt, according to bond market analysts.
The process of bond stripping is common in the US. Outside the US, the
practice of stripping bonds is not particularly widespread. The French
government has encouraged stripping of French bond issues, and with effect
from this week, the Dutch will start the process of stripping the
recently-issued 30-year bond.
When the Dutch issued a new 30-year bond at the end of last year, several
banks and brokers approached the agent of the Ministry of Finance asking for
permission to strip the bond, claiming that insurance companies would be
interested in buying the principal, while individual investors might want to
buy the coupon stream.
One London-based dealer in Dutch bonds says the move is likely to enhance
demand for the bonds: 'For the big insurance companies, the principal
provides a good match for their liabilities, and it is tax-efficient not
getting the coupon stream -  it means you can tailor-make bonds from
existing issues.'
The agent has agreed to give licences permitting brokers to strip a
specified amount of stock. There is about Fl 4.5bn of the 7.5 per cent bond
due 2023 available, although the agent has said that it will continue to
issue the stock during 1993. Mr Hank Bevers, agent of the Ministry of
Finance, says that permission will be given for about half of the issue to
be stripped, if there is sufficient demand. By awarding licences, he says it
should be possible to ensure that liquidity in the bonds is maintained.
News that the 30-year bonds would be stripped certainly helped lift the
price of the issue. If the Dutch experience is a success, will the Bank of
England feel more comfortable about introducing a gilt strip market here ?
The Bank says that gilt-stripping 'does actually happen in a rather small,
tailor-made way'. Some gilt-edged market makers point out that they have
been able to ask the Bank for permission to strip gilts 'on an individual
customised basis', although they add that it takes place rarely.
Most of the investors who want to strip gilts are non-resident: for tax
reasons, it simply is not attractive for the UK investor. For while the
investor would normally hope to buy the principal and benefit from a capital
gain, bond analysts point out that this part of the stripped bond would be
taxed as a deep-discounted security. The 1989 budget saw the introduction of
rules which were intended to 'ensure that discounts and premiums which take
the place of interest are properly taxed as income'.
One big US bond house says it would 'love to strip bonds, but it's just not
realistic under the current tax regime'. An analyst at one of the big four
gilt-edged market makers points out that if the tax situation could be
resolved, the development of a proper gilt strip market would probably be
welcomed by a lot of investors. 'Customers such as pension funds, which have
relatively well-known, long-term, fixed liabilities want effective zero
coupon bonds (ie, the principal) where they can create the duration that
they want. And there would be demand for the coupons from insurance
companies producing annuities,' he says.
Mr Tim Lund, analyst at CS First Boston, believes the problems could be
overcome: 'The development of a gilt strip market is desirable, but must be
carefully thought through. We conclude that: UK taxation of zeros must be
remodelled on US practice; stripped coupons should be paid only on a
quarterly sequence of dates; and a fee, based on the market price spread
between strips and bonds, should be charged or refunded as appropriate for
stripping and recompositions.'

FT  15 FEB 93 / US Money and Credit: Poised for the President's long-awaited
package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER many months of election campaign promises and nearly four weeks in
office, President Bill Clinton is poised to unveil his long-awaited economic
package. It will be detailed on Wednesday evening in Mr Clinton's first
State of the Union message.
The information contained in Mr Clinton's speech is likely to influence the
parameters of Treasury bond trading activity for several months to come. On
Thursday morning the market will have still more information when it digests
the contents of Senate testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve.
Investors in the Treasury bond market have speculated, discounted and
satisfied themselves that Mr Clinton's hands are sufficiently tied by the
size of the US budget deficit that he is unlikely to push through a large
fiscal stimulus programme. Indeed, Mr Clinton's comments during a televised
meeting last week included a call for sacrifice on the part of taxpayers,
another indication that the fiscal stimulus package could be more modest
than was promised during the campaign.
Among the possible features of the economic package that should please the
bond market are tax increases for corporate America and for high-earning
individuals, as well as increased taxes on social security benefits for
wealthy Americans. The higher taxes are likely to be accompanied by cuts in
government spending levels.
Further signs of a deficit-battling approach that should please the bond
market include the fact that some of the latest macroeconomic indicators
show the US recovery picking up its pace. In addition, Clinton
administration officials have been stressing in recent days the degree to
which the Bush administration understated the size of the prospective budget
deficit -  by about Dollars 50bn.
The market's assumption is that since the deficit is bigger than had been
thought before, there could be less room for manoeuvre on the stimulus
front.
Mr Clinton's comments last week did help the Treasury bond market to stage
something of a late rally, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year paper
declining to 7.12 per cent on Friday, from 7.15 per cent a week before.
Analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the New York securities firm, are
thinking in terms of a short-term fiscal stimulus package totalling Dollars
31bn, and a long-run deficit reduction proposal of about Dollars 145bn. DLJ
noted that the deficit reduction plan could be met by scepticism in the
market. The view of SG Warburg analysts on Friday was more bullish.
While noting that the market is wary of pricing too much good news from the
President on deficit reduction, Warburg said 'we have a strong hunch that
Clinton will look and sound impressive' in his address on Wednesday. If that
occurs the trend towards a 7 per cent yield at the long end of the Treasury
market should remain intact, according to Warburg.
Not everyone operating in the highly speculative mood ahead of Mr Clinton's
address is so confident.
Mr Philip Braverman, chief economist at DKB Securities, agreed that Treasury
yields should continue to drop, even below the 7 per cent level. But Mr
Braverman pointed out that the strength of the US recovery should not be
overstated. He predicted last week that a more likely scenario will be
on-again, off-again recovery, citing as his main reason the fact that many
of the root causes of the recent recession have not been corrected.
Excessive debt burdens, the credit crunch, the overhang of commercial
property loans at banks and cuts in defence spending could still prove a
burden during 1993. Mr Clinton's speech will be significant and
market-moving, but it is unlikely to be a panacea.

SPEAR, Leeds and Kellogg, the largest specialist firm on the New York stock
exchange, is close to acquiring the operations of LIT America, the big US
clearing house.
LIT America is part of LIT Holdings, a UK marketing services and fund
management group. In 1991, it achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.29m
(Dollars 1.94m) on turnover of Pounds 83m.
With the purchase -  LIT America is the dominant clearing firm for the
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange -  Spear, Leeds
will become the biggest guarantor of exchange-traded derivatives in the US.
LIT America owns First Options, the biggest clearing firm at the CBOE. It
has a trade guaranteeing business at the CBOE. Spear Leeds would operate LIT
America's businesses through a newly-formed company that will retain LIT's
Dollars 65m in capitalisation and include LIT's senior management and
existing employees.
The sale will include LIT's capital markets operations in New York and the
Chicago futures and options businesses.
Spear Leeds has a capitalisation of about Dollars 200m. It bought
PaineWebber's specialist operations last October, and represents more than
10 per cent of New York stock exchange listings.

FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sir James Goldsmith trims
Newmont Mining stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS Sir James Goldsmith, the retired international deal-maker, losing
patience with gold?
That was the question being asked by mining analysts after 1.8m shares in
Newmont Mining, representing 2.6 per cent of North America's biggest gold
mining company, were placed with 50 institutions.
Sir James paid Dollars 1.1bn cash for a 42 per cent stake in Newmont in
October, 1990, saying that the world monetary system was in a mess and that
gold would return to favour.
The first sign that he might have changed his mind came when his General
Oriental Investment, which holds the Newmont shares, sold 1.8m in November
last year. Then, on Thursday, came news of the placing. On Friday, the
shares closed at Dollars 39.50, down Dollars 2.375 in two days.
Analysts suggested there could be only one source of so many Newmont shares
 - Sir James's General Oriental. One said: 'We know that he was no lover of
equities and quite a fan of gold when he acquired the Newmont stake. It
looks as if he is still negative on equities but is losing patience with
gold. It looks as if there is a tap on the (Newmont) market.'
However, Sir James insisted at the weekend there was no change in his
strategy or his views about gold and the monetary system.
He said it had been made clear at the time General Oriental bought the
Newmont stake that in due course the shareholding would be reduced because
the investment was too large for GO.
No more than 1.8m shares had been sold by GO and he guessed that the Newmont
share placing by Salomon Brothers last Thursday was simply the same tranche
'going into firm hands.'
He rejected suggestions that the sale indicated he was losing faith in
Newmont. He was 'very pleased' with changes that had taken place in the
company since he joined the board in July 1991.
Sir James added: 'I continue to be a bull of gold -  it has just taken
longer than I expected to come into its own. I continue to be a bear of
equities. I continue to believe the world's monetary system is in a mess.'

FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Structural flaws undermine
Nippon Housing / Attempts to rescue an ailing property developer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Back in the heady days of the late 1980s, Nippon Housing Loan could do no
wrong. Property developers queued for loans, rural financial institutions
rushed to pump money into the company, and individual investors were
enthusiastic purchasers of its mortgage-backed securities.
Nippon Housing was so delighted by mortgage certificate sales that it
decided to give the product a new Japanese name, yorokobi, or
congratulations. In summing up the successes of 1988, the company noted that
it had 'secured high-grade customers' and invested in 'superior properties'.
However, since then the funds washing over the Japanese economy have receded
and the property market has collapsed in on itself.
Nippon Housing has been left with an estimated Y1,300bn (Dollars 10.3bn) in
non-performing loans out of a total loan portfolio of Y2,200bn.
It is the most serious political problem on the country's bad loan books.
and with the political background in mind, the Bank of Japan and the
Ministry of Finance are negotiating a bail-out with the nine commercial
banks which founded Nippon Housing, and with other leading institutional
lenders.
The parties are close to an initial agreement, but the deep structural flaws
at Nippon Housing are likely to force the government to lend assistance,
directly or indirectly.
The nine commercial banks, whose exposure is estimated at about 33 per cent
of the total, will accept a reduction to nominal interest rates of between
zero per cent and 1 per cent. The influential farmers' groups, who provided
about 35 per cent of the funds, will take a rate fall from about 6 per cent
to 4.5 per cent.
Affected institutions are likely to get help from the Bank of Japan, which
can support the rescue by offering them more loans at the official discount
rate (ODR), allowing them to profit from the margin with market rates. In
the longer term, the government may have to consider direct assistance.
Nippon Housing Loan was founded in 1971 by the nine banks, including Sanwa
Bank and Sakura Bank, which, at that time, were focused on industrial
clients and not on individual borrowers. Eight housing loan companies were
established, with Nippon Housing the largest, and all had to find new
clients during the 1980s, when commercial banks put more emphasis on their
own housing loan divisions.
The commercial banks had grown wary of the lending enthusiasm of Nippon
Housing, and gradually reduced their exposure. The new Nippon Housing
clients were property developers, some of which were unable to get funds
from mainstream banks, but which found the housing company willing to lend
for speculative apartment projects and out-of-town office buildings .
With demand still strong, new sources of funds were needed, and along came
the farmers' groups. Not only Norinchukin, the central agricultural bank,
which has an exposure estimated at Y157.9bn, but small regional agricultural
institutions ploughed funds into Nippon Housing.
While farm-related institutions account for more than a third of the
exposure to Nippon Housing, they are the most reluctant to accept an
interest rate reduction. The Ministry of Agriculture even attempted to link
the bail-out to the rice market by suggesting that farm groups be fully
repaid in expectation of allowing rice imports.
Norinchukin argues that the government is responsible for the housing loan
companies because 'they were established in the 1970s at the government's
request'. The agricultural bank also insists that the Ministry of Finance,
which had direct control over the institutions, should be held responsible,
as should the founder commercial banks.
The Norinchukin response reflects the surprise in Japan at the risk that
goes with investment. When looking at Nippon Housing, investors saw instead
Sanwa Bank, Sakura Bank, Daiwa Bank, and the other famous founders, who, at
the same time, were reducing their exposure to the company.
Purchasers of the mortgage-backed certificates, happy to take an interest
return far higher than available on bank deposits, were unaware that Nippon
Housing had befriended some of the country's shakier developers. In 1986,
the total of outstanding certificates was Y22.1bn, but that rose to Y87.96bn
by the end of March 1989, and Y300.99bn as at March last year.
In Japan, most of these certificates are issued on individual buildings,
rather than on a parcel of properties, which would spread the risk. The
Mortgage Certificate Companies' Association admits that an unspecified
number of these development projects have flopped, but says the certificate
holders should have no fear.
'This is not America. The housing loan companies are not going to collapse,'
the association says. But awareness of the risk and the slowing of new
developments has lead to a fall in demand for the certificates -  the
outstanding value of certificates was Y6,500bn at end-September, down 0.4
per cent from March, the first fall since the association began collecting
national figures in 1989.
Nippon Housing Loan says that if a developer which has borrowed on the
mortgage collapses, 'we can use that mortgage to return money to investors'
or 'we offer to buy the certificates that have problems and issue new ones
that don't have problems'. The former method raises the same question facing
Japanese banks -  how to cash in property collateral for which there are no
buyers.
Regardless of the final terms of the rescue package, Nippon Housing Loan
will weigh heavily on the Japanese financial system for the next few years.

FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: German textile producer files
for protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NINO, one of Germany's largest textile companies, has filed for protection
from creditors.
The Nordhorn-based company said that business conditions had become so bad
over December and January that it had no alternative but to apply for a
Vergleich -  the German equivalent of Chapter 11 proceedings.
It is proposing to put in place a settlement whereby creditors receive 40
per cent of what they are owed. Under the proposals, creditors would write
off loans totalling between DM110m (Dollars 68.1m) and DM120m. Deutsche
Bank, the company's biggest creditor and a large shareholder, supports the
proposals.
This would reduce the company's interest costs by about DM10m a year,
thereby enhancing the chances that Nino could preserve its independence and
enhance its chances of forging a strategic alliance with a partner, the
company said.
Nino plans a further reduction in wage costs. In December its 2,400
employees had agreed to wage cuts in tandem with an agreement from banks to
forego credits, but these measures did not prevent what the company termed a
liquidity squeeze as business conditions deteriorated.
The application for debt composition proceedings follows several difficult
years for the company, which made operating losses of DM17.4m in the year
ended March, 1992 after losses of DM28m in 1990-91. Turnover last year was
DM419.7m against DM410.7m.
Nino has ben hit by the combination of poor conditions in textile markets
and heavy debts. It had struggled over recent years to reduce its dependence
on low-margin woollen products in favour of higher value-added products.
The German textile industry has suffered from the general downturn in
economic conditions and has been buffeted by cheap imports. In the first
eight months of last year, German textile production fell 8 per cent with
production of clothing materials tumbling 12 per cent in the first six
months.

FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Decision day for Shaw rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBEL SHAREHOLDERS at Arthur Shaw, the loss-making West Midlands building
materials group, will today try to unseat the company's embattled chairman,
Mr Gordon Pearson, and take control of the board.
The rebels are led by Mr Ian Tickler, Mr Pearson's predecessor, whose family
founded the company in 1909 and was chairman when it joined the USM in 1988.
The Tickler family still controls a 13.4 per cent equity stake in the name
of Grange Nominees, against Mr Pearson's 15 per cent.
The dissidents requisitioned today's extraordinary meeting to propose Mr
Pearson's removal from the board and the reappointment of Mr Tickler. They
are also calling for the reappointment of Mr Donald Crammond, who was ousted
from the board at the annual meeting last August.
According to Granville, the stockbroker advising the Tickler family,
shareholders representing more than 49 per cent of the company's equity are
supporting the move. They claim their campaign has been strengthened by a
division on the board which emerged after Mr Alan Bearman, a non-executive
director and former finance director, issued a statement disassociating
himself from a letter sent to shareholders by Mr Pearson.
Dissident shareholders have expressed concern over the management and recent
performance of the company, and fears that the business is losing direction.
They claim that the group's high level of gearing and deteriorating
performance are mainly attributable to the costs of acquiring the Jackdaw
engineering tools group in 1990.

FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: BZW sets up specialist property
unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking subsidiary of Barclays Bank,
has established a new specialist property unit to advise on debt
restructuring and equity investments.
The establishment of BZW's Property Advisory Group is its first attempt to
bring together a team of specialists to advise on property. The bank
believes there is now overseas interest in UK property investments.
Although Barclays has substantial exposure to property debt because of its
lending to property companies such as Imry and Speyhawk, the advisory group
will only offer fee-based advice to Barclays on similar terms to other
clients.
Paul Marcuse, a director, said the outstanding property debt of Pounds 38bn
in the UK, as well as the large amount of corporate debt secured on
property, meant there was a strong demand for new debt instruments.
'There is clearly a very pressing need to come up with non-bank financing
alternatives for property debt,' said Mr Marcuse. He said BZW believed that
activity in the property sector would provide demand for fee-based advice.
The advisory group will offer advice on financings and refinancings, mergers
and acquisitions, and investment advice for overseas Barclays clients
interested in UK property.

FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banks consider Heron proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL proposals on a Pounds 1.4bn debt refinancing plan to rescue Heron,
the property and trading group, have been sent for approval to the 82 banks
involved after an agreement to recommend the proposals among Heron's lead
banks.
The banks have to approve the final documentation by the end of this month
if Heron is to continue to meet its obligations. After bank approval, the
company's bondholders will be consulted.
The pressure on banks and bondholders to reach a speedy settlement was
increased by Heron's decision earlier this month to stop paying fees it
regards as not essential to achieving its restructuring.
Final proposals were sent out to Heron's banks about 10 days ago after the
banks' steering committee, led by Barclays, agreed the documentation. The
process of refinancing was originally started last March.
The banks had already given approval to the first outline of the refinancing
proposals when this was made in October, but since then there has been
extensive work on drawing up detailed final proposals for their approval.
Under the October proposal, banks and bondholders which lent Pounds 775m to
Heron's head office group are being offered Pounds 400m in equity, Pounds
300m in senior debt maturing in March 1997, and Pounds 75m in junior debt
expiring in 2000.
Banks which lent to other parts of the group will be repaid in cash from
disposal proceeds over periods up to 1997. The banks are being asked to put
in Pounds 20m of capital.
Unless the refinancing is completed, Heron would go into receivership. The
company itself set a deadline of the end of February for the refinancing to
establish fresh terms on which the holding company can trade.
Bondholders are expected to be offered detailed terms similar to the banks
which have a small exposure.

TSB chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER

<TEXT>
Mr Don McCrickard, the former TSB Group chief executive who resigned in
August last year, received a payment of Pounds 763,432, it has been
disclosed in the bank's annual report, writes John Gapper.
The bank said that Mr McCrickard received the sum because he was on a
three-year rolling contract which entitled him to a severance sum worth
three times his final salary, plus an amount to compensate for benefits.
Mr McCrickard's total emoluments in 1991 were Pounds 252,200. Mr Peter
Ellwood, who succeeded him as chief executive, received Pounds 373,407 last
year and was the bank's highest paid director.
The bank said yesterday that its directors were now all on one-year rolling
contracts.

FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Trinity's scheme of arrangement
is approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS and policyholders of Trinity Insurance have overwhelmingly agreed
a 'scheme of arrangement', averting the need for a fully fledged liquidation
of the general insurer which collapsed last year with gross liabilities of
Pounds 208m.
The size of the vote in favour of the scheme was welcomed by Price
Waterhouse, the company's provisional liquidators. PW said the level of
support 'indicates the willingness of the insurance market to accept
creative means of dealing with the future of insurance companies.'
The scheme allows the directors to remain in charge of the company during
its winding down under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner.
'The great majority of insurance companies that go under are liquidated.
This is bad news for policyholders,' said Mr Paul Evans of PW. 'We believe
this is a positive move forward.'
Mr Evans said Price Waterhouse is hoping to be able to pay creditors between
60p and 70p in the pound. A liquidation would have delayed any pay-out for
many years.
In all, 1,142 of the company's creditors and policyholders -  who are owed
Pounds 128.8m by Trinity -  voted in favour of the scheme. Among them were
Trinity's biggest creditors -  the Inland Revenue, Barclays Bank and Market
Building, the insurance consortium which owns the London Underwriting
Centre.
Only 13 creditors -  who are together owed Pounds 10.8m -  voted against.
The scheme will not become effective until court approval has been obtained
within the next four weeks.
Trinity has 15,000 policyholders and creditors.
The Trinity scheme is the first of several major schemes being prepared for
London market companies. Price Waterhouse is provisional liquidator in three
other cases -  Bryanston, Andrew Weir and Monument.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Bank looks at stripping of gilt issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England is considering changing its rules to allow gilt-edged
specialists to create zero-coupon issues by separating the interest and
principal repayment flows on government bonds.
A move to permit what is known in the trade as bond-stripping would help
fund the public sector deficit by offering investors new ways of holding
government stock. City economists estimate the government will have to sell
Pounds 1bn of gilts each week in the coming financial year.
The practice of stripping the interest coupons from bonds is common in the
US, and some European markets have embarked on a similar system. The
Netherlands has recently decided to start stripping 30-year bonds, prompted
by demand from investors such as insurance companies.
The Bank approached Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) recently and asked
whether it would be worth developing a gilt strip market. The Bank is
thought to have discussed gilt-stripping with other investment banks, but
said only that it 'continues to monitor every aspect of the market'.
Bond dealers point out that the main obstacle at the moment to the
development of a gilt strip market is the UK tax regime. CSFB said the main
problems concern the taxation of zero-coupon bonds in the UK, and the
scatter of gilt coupon payment dates throughout the year, but said these
obstacles are not insurmountable.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Investors subscribe HKDollars 240bn for issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENWAY Investment, which indirectly controls a 46 per cent interest in
Peugeot's car manufacturing business in Guangzhou, yesterday set a record
for oversubscription on the Hong Kong stock market when investors put up
HKDollars 240bn (Pounds 20bn) for HKDollars 402m of stock.
The strength of investor interest in Hong Kong for Chinese new issues has
been the dominant theme of the local stock market for the past year. The
most popular new issue of 1992 was China Travel Service - 411 times
oversubscribed with investors putting up HKDollars 150bn.
Denway's offer, however, exceeded that by a large margin. It was
oversubscribed 657 times and the amount of money stumped up was equal to
about one third of Hong Kong gross domestic product and nearly five times
the amount of Hong Kong dollars in circulation.
Last week the fund-raising associated with the issue caused a severe strain
on the colony's money markets and rekindled official interest in reviewing
the method by which new issues are sold to the public.
Both the Exchange Fund, the colony's de facto monetary authority, and the
Securities and Futures Commission have begun an investigation into
alternative means of floating shares in new companies.
Some merchant bankers believe that Hong Kong should move to a tender system
for new issues. The Exchange Fund is also expected to examine issues of risk
associated with possible corporate or stockbroker failure during the period
of subscription, given the large sums of money involved.
Denway offered 330m shares, equal to 25 per cent of the company, at
HKDollars 1.22 each; grey market trading last week suggested that Denway
would open at a price of about HKDollars 2.85 when official stock market
trading begins on February 22.
Mr Zhang Bohau, the company's chairman, said: 'We are extremely pleased with
the enthusiastic response to the issues and we are very confident that
investors will be rewarded for their support . . . we are poised for
dramatic growth.'
The company has 11 divisions. One is the leading shareholder in Guangzhou
Peugeot, which last year made 20,550 cars and trucks, up from 12,628 in
1991.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Economics Notebook: Time to change the rules of the funding
game
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a supposedly pragmatic and practical people, the British have an abiding
love of complex, rule-based systems.
Whether the game is cricket, Cluedo or financing the government deficit, no
effort is spared in making sure that complicated regulations bring maximum
satisfaction to the players involved.
Britain's rules for financing or 'funding' the public sector borrowing
requirement are a case in point.
The subject is rich in theology and tradition. It has spawned a language
unique to UK financial markets. Nowhere else in the world do people speak of
'funding', 'fully funding', 'underfunding' or even 'unfunding' the deficits
which governments routinely run in the management of national economies.
But with Britain set to run Pounds 50bn annual deficits into the foreseeable
future and UK inflation falling to below 2 per cent, the time may be ripe
for changing Britain's long-standing, self-imposed restrictions on how to
finance the PSBR.
In a period in which UK economic policy and performance have gone through
many changes, the rules about plugging the government deficit have been
surprisingly constant. The authorities today, as in the mid 1980s, 'seek to
fund the net total of maturing debt, the PSBR and any underlying increase in
the foreign exchange reserves by sales of debt outside the banking and
building society sectors'.
This so-called full funding rule means that the government does not set out
to sell debt to the UK's banks and building societies. Indeed, if any such
sales take place, it will deliberately sell more gilts to the non-bank
private sector to compensate.
Any rule that forces the government to increase its gilt sales in this way
is clearly inconvenient, and especially so at a time of ballooning deficits.
But since becoming chancellor in November 1990, Mr Norman Lamont has firmly
rejected any shift away from full funding. In evidence to the Commons
Treasury and Civil Service Committee last November, he ruled out any idea of
'underfunding' the deficit which would be one consequence of allowing banks
and building societies to invest in government bonds.
No other industrialised nation draws this distinction between funding and
financing deficits. Other governments sell their debt without worrying
whether it is bought by banks, the local equivalent of building societies,
financial institutions such as pension funds or individuals.
Britain's peculiar approach is rooted in its inflationary past and the
country's inability in the early 1980s to control inflation by targeting the
growth of broad money.
The economic rationale for the full funding rule is that the government
should not print money to finance the deficit.
In its Budget 'Red Book' of March 1990, the Treasury clarified the
counter-inflationary reasons for Britain sticking to the full fund rule.
The rule, it said, 'ensures that the PSBR is financed by means other than
any increase in issue of notes and coin. It also means that the direct
effect of the PSBR on broad money is neutralised, with none of it financed
by net borrowing from banks and building societies'.
However, Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist of Midland Global Markets, has
argued that the combination of a large PSBR and a policy of full funding may
actually reduce the growth of broad money, rather than be neutral. Mr
Bootle's case is that financial flows from the deficit to industrial and
commercial companies and individuals may help reduce their borrowing from
banks and building societies and hence curb the growth of the UK money
stock.
Such a development would matter little if broad money played no part in
British monetary policy. But since Britain's departure from the European
exchange rate mechanism in September, the government has decided to monitor
M4, the broad money measure which includes bank and building society
deposits.
The cut in bank base rates to 6 per cent on January 26 was triggered
primarily by the news that M4 was growing at below its 4 to 8 per cent
annual 'monitoring range' and that there was no sign of any lift-off in bank
and building society lending.
The weak growth of broad money and so-called M4 lending, together with the
fall in inflation to its lowest level for a generation and a reversal of
gilts yield curve since September from an inverse to a conventional,
upwards-sloping, pattern, could provide the rationale for the government to
ease its funding rules without too much loss of face.
As broad money is currently growing at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent, the
authorities should be able to sell an estimated Pounds 10bn of debt to banks
and building societies without M4 coming close to the upper limit of its
monitoring range.
Admittedly, there is some doubt about whether banks would want to invest in
UK government bonds. But the sharp fall in inflation to an annual rate of
1.7 per cent in January, coming on top of the change in the shape of the
yield curve since September, could increase the attraction of gilts for UK
banks. Gilts would be even more appealing if, as most City commentators
expect, short-term interest rates fall further from 6 per cent around the
time of the Budget on March 16.
The Treasury is currently reviewing the whole issue of funding. It is also a
subject of active debate in the Bank of England where some senior officials
have been urging the adoption of continental-style financing rules for the
PSBR instead of full funding.
The fact that other countries can finance their deficits without fueling
inflation should be a strong argument for change.
One objection might be that it is dangerous to abandon any rule that conveys
anti-inflationary rigour in a country as inflation-prone as the UK. But Mr
Michael Saunders, UK economist of Salomon Brothers International in London,
says that a simple answer to this would be for the government to declare
firmly that it will not use short-term borrowing to finance the deficit.
Its borrowing rules would then be in line with best practice abroad and Mr
Lamont would find it less of a struggle to plug the deficit.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Unigate buys Glass Glover for Pounds 54m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIGATE, the food and distribution group, is buying Glass Glover, the
logistics company, for Pounds 54m. Unigate will pay Pounds 43.8m in cash and
Pounds 10.2m in loan notes. It is also considering floating its US
restaurant business this summer.
Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of Unigate since October 1990, said that
the group had been 'going through a lot of change' with acquisitions and
disposals. He hoped people outside the company would now see the strategy
more clearly.
He said the main thrust was to strengthen the food and distribution
activities in the UK which would then give a base for expansion into
continental Europe. More deals are expected.
The possible flotation of the US restaurant business, which operates under
the Black-Eyed Pea and Taco Bueno names, could raise a significant sum. It
made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 13.3m in the year to March 1992, and interim
profits rose from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 8.4m.
Glass Glover was the subject of a Pounds 47m management buy-out in 1988 and
was planning a return to the stock market this month. However, Unigate's
purchase price, which includes the Glass Glover debt, compares with a
flotation valuation expected in the region of Pounds 40m to Pounds 45m.
Glass Glover's main business is operating warehouses and distribution for
large retail groups. It made an operating profit of Pounds 5.5m on sales of
Pounds 84.8m in the year to October 3, 1992. On a pro-forma basis, allowing
for the repayment of debt, after-tax profits would have been Pounds 3.4m
giving an exit multiple of 16. Assets involved are worth Pounds 5.7m.
Mr Buckland said there was little overlap between Unigate's distribution
operations and Glass Glover's and that the latter's customers, such as
Tesco, Littlewoods and Asda, had supported the change of ownership.
Mr Buckland said that following the Glass Glover deal, and if two other
deals -  the Pounds 50.4m agreed bid for Clifford Foods and the Pounds 17m
purchase of some of the Co-operative Wholesale Society's milk businesses -
go through, Unigate's gearing would top 60 per cent. However, he stressed
the company was not planning a rights issue. Cash could be raised from
disposals. Since he arrived at Unigate, a number of businesses have been
sold, notably the JP Wood poultry operation for Pounds 36.7m and the US
cheese companies for Dollars 75m (Pounds 49.6m).

FT  15 FEB 93 / Bronfman family sells its jewels to ease the strain / A look
at the disposal of MacMillan Bloedel and John Labatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO firm conclusions can be drawn from the sudden sale last week of two
jewels in the business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family.
First, the disposal, in quick succession, of controlling stakes in MacMillan
Bloedel, the big west coast forestry company, and John Labatt, which brews
more than four out of every ten beers drunk in Canada, is clear evidence
that one of North America's biggest agglomerations of family wealth is
shrinking.
Second, with its coffers set to swell by almost CDollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn),
the sprawling web of resource, industrial, financial and property companies
is in better shape today than it was last Monday.
But the Macblo and Labatt deals also leave some awkward questions
unanswered. Outsiders have been left wondering why the group was in quite
such a hurry to make the disposals. Nor do they know whether the CDollars
2bn will be enough to relieve whatever strains there may be in parts of the
domain hidden from public view.
The Bronfman fortune, built on brothers Peter and Edward's inheritance from
the founders of the Seagram drinks empire, consists of about 30 public
companies, which until recently had a value equal to roughly 6 per cent of
listings on the Toronto stock exchange, The 'Toronto' or 'Edper' Bronfmans,
as Edward and Peter are known, are cousins of the family which today
controls Seagram, but their businesses are entirely separate.
Edper's senior managers -  themselves substantial shareholders in the
family's holding companies -  insist that last week's deals were not forced
on them.
'Did we sell out in panic or in urgent need? The answer is an emphatic no,'
says Mr Bob Harding, president of Hees International, the Bronfmans'
merchant banking arm. 'Our game plan is to simplify and streamline the group
and these two sales are part of that process.'
Macblo, which has suffered heavy losses in the past two years, is generating
less cash than other pulp and paper companies controlled by Noranda, its
immediate parent. The sale will substantially improve Noranda's balance
sheet.
Bronfman officials insist that the 38 per cent stake in Labatt wasn't even
for sale until Wood Gundy, the Canadian securities firm, suddenly came up
with a proposal for a 'bought deal'. Wood Gundy confirms that it turned down
an invitation to join the dealer group which bought the Macblo shares, but
was so impressed by the enthusiasm from investors that it quickly put
together the Labatt deal.
Furthermore, the Bronfman managers say that the problem areas of the group
are under control. An Ontario court is expected to approve a restructuring
plan for Bramalea, the debt-laden property developer, within the next month
or so. The group is also 'guardedly optimistic' that a financial institution
will be found to buy a big slice of ailing Royal Trust, Canada's
second-biggest trust and loan company.
Mr Trevor Eyton, chairman of Brascan, another Bronfman holding company, says
companies throughout the group have raised CDollars 2bn in equity, CDollars
5bn by asset sales and CDollars 5bn in non-bank term debt in the past few
years.
'We have built the group based on equity in diverse public companies and not
on short-term debt.' Mr Eyton adds.
It will be an uphill struggle, though, to reassure an investment community
which has been alienated by the impenetrable structure of the Bronfman group
and its penchant for cavalier treatment of outside shareholders. Analysts
question why Macblo was put on the block just as the forest-product cycle
shows signs of turning up. As for Labatt, rumours have swirled for some time
of a deal with a US brewer. The Bronfmans may have got a better price for
the two by waiting a little longer.
Both deals, which were among the biggest equity offerings ever by Canadian
companies, were done at prevailing market prices.
But investors who have bought the shares will pay in three instalments over
the next two years, giving a net present value about 6 per cent below
market. In each case, the offering was sold out almost instantly.
One Toronto analyst concludes that the Bronfmans are 'selling some of the
better assets to finance some of the weaker ones'.
The concern is less with operating units, such as Noranda, than with
companies higher up the ladder like Hees, Edper Enterprises and Pagurian.
Despite the high profile of Bronfman operating companies in Canadian
business, the precise links between them are unclear.
A hallmark of the Bronfman structure is the intricate cross-holdings of
preferred shares issued in a 'cascading' pattern, from one layer to the
next, to finance the group's expansion over the past 15 years. To this end,
a host of little-known private companies has been interposed between the
public units.
As one analyst puts it, 'there's no debt, but still lots of leverage'.
Labatt, for instance, holds some CDollars 250m in preferred shares issued by
other Bronfman companies.
The strains in the property and financial-services arms, as well as fears
that other troublesome investments may be lurking away from the public eye,
have raised questions about the value of preferred shares held by the
holding companies.
Investors will keep an especially close watch on preferred dividends
declared by Bronfman companies in the months ahead. For the moment at least,
Mr Eyton says there are no plans for further asset sales.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Kuwait holds up Opec deal on output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT'S resistance to making substantial cuts in oil production was last
night holding up agreement by ministers of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to reduce output in the second quarter of the year and
shore up oil prices.
Other delegations at the Vienna meeting last night broadly accepted a Saudi
Arabian proposal to cut Opec's second-quarter production by about 1m barrels
a day from a first-quarter ceiling of 24.58m b/d agreed in November.
But Kuwait, pleading special dispensation to maximise oil earnings and pay
for its post-Gulf war reconstruction, was resisting concerted pressure to
agree to pro-rata output cuts.
The Gulf state said it was unhappy with the level of cuts that fellow
members believed it must make if the cartel was to satisfy the markets.
A series of late night bilateral meetings appeared to have made little
progress in the effort to persuade Kuwait to accept the position of most
members.
The Saudi formula would, if the cartel obeyed its own ceiling, take nearer
to 1.5m b/d off the oil market, given that most estimates by the industry
put Opec output for the present quarter at more than 25m b/d. To attain
that, members would be expected to cut output from their claimed production
levels at the time of the November meeting. At that point Kuwait was lifting
about 1.5m b/d.
The Gulf state, however, has insisted that it did not receive a quota as
such in November and anyway should be regarded as a special case while it is
repairing damage done by the war.
Kuwait claims its present production to be about 1.98m b/d, which would rise
to 2.1m b/d in the second quarter, and wants any cuts to be considered only
from this level.
Other delegations, and many industry specialists, believe a present Kuwaiti
production figure of about 1.7m-1.8m b/d to be more credible.
Some delegations, including Saudi Arabia, argue that Opec cannot deliver a
credible output cut while allowing Kuwait such leeway.
Patience has worn thin among other delegations for Kuwait's call for special
treatment. 'Every country has got economic problems,' said one Nigerian
delegate.
Neither do many Opec countries want to set a precedent for special treatment
with the prospect of Iraq's re-entry on to the oil market looming, albeit
fairly distantly.
Anything less than a unanimous agreement to cut production to somewhere near
23.5m b/d, and corresponding discipline in meeting the target, is likely to
disappoint the markets.
They have built Dollars 1.50-Dollars 2 into the price of crude before this
weekend's meeting on the back of apparent consensus to cut at least 1m b/d
from the November ceiling.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Legislative programme may be slimmed for next session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's business managers are preparing for a clampdown on the
amount of legislation being planned for the next session.
Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, and the government whips are
getting ready to warn ministers that some controversial bills will have to
be rejected to avoid overloading the programme.
The government's managers believe that the impact of having to deal with an
overall majority of only 21 has not been fully recognised in ministers'
legislative plans, partly because it has been obscured by the peculiar
circumstances of the Maastricht bill this session.
They also believe that the move to a unified Budget and spending statement
in December could have an adverse impact on the programme. Unless the new
session starts early in November, there is a danger that the combination of
a week's debate on the Queen's speech at the start of the session, followed
by a week-long debate on the Budget will delay discussion of individual
bills.
Officials in the Cabinet Office are holding meetings with departments to try
to weed out some of the more unlikely bills before ministers have a
preliminary discussion of the programme, probably later this month.
The main departmental bids include:
A banking bill, proposed by the Treasury, mainly to take account of
recommendations in the wake of the Bingham inquiry into the collapse of
BCCI.
Legislation to reform agricultural landlord and tenant law.
A comprehensive 'green' bill, urged by Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary. It would set up a unified environmental protection agency, and
might also include provisions to introduce market instruments such as
tradeable permits. But as departments have to bid for numbers of clauses as
well as the number of bills, the government's business managers may well try
to cut its size.
A pensions bill proposed by the social security department. It would deal
with the equalisation of the pension age, as well as changes to occupational
pensions law recommended by the Goode committee.
A bill to deregulate London buses. Mr John MacGregor, the transport
secretary, may also press for provisions to make local authorities sell
their airports, if too few of them do so voluntarily.
For Scotland, the main legislation would be to implement the government's
decisions on water privatisation and re-organising local government. There
is also a suggestion that the 'stock-taking' exercise, on which a white
paper is expected shortly, might require a small bill
A bill from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to
privatise British Coal. He also wants a bill to simplify the law on
trademarks and one to reform restrictive practices and trades description
law.
Two large bills from Mr John Patten, the education secretary. One to reform
teacher training, making the courses more classroom-based; and one to make
membership of the National Union of Students voluntary. A bill to put the
security and intelligence services on a statutory footing
A handful of bills from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary. A police bill
and reform of the Sunday trading law are the main elements, but he is also
pressing for a criminal justice bill. If he fails to persuade his colleagues
that the bill on the boundary changes to take account of the extra six seats
for the European elections should be dealt with in the current session, that
will be a priority for the next legislative programme.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Clinton to unveil economic plan: Message of 'fair, shared
sacrifice' - Limits to be set on health care spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE White House will today launch an elaborate campaign to sell President
Bill Clinton's new economic plan, which provides a modest job-creation
package and price controls on medical care for the elderly.
President Clinton will make the economy the focus of his first televised
speech from the Oval Office tonight. The thrust of his message will be that
'fair, shared sacrifice' is necessary for long-term prosperity.
Although administration officials insist that the economic plan has not yet
been finalised, details have been slowly emerging. To address flagging
employment growth, the president will propose a Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn)
'booster shot' programme combining tax incentives and infrastructure
spending. It is expected to create about 200,000 jobs.
The economic plan will be roughly balanced between new taxes and about 150
spending cuts, Mr George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications
director, said.
On health, new limits will be placed on payments to doctors and hospitals by
Medicare, the health care scheme for the elderly. Reports at the weekend
suggested the administration might be looking for savings of as much as
Dollars 35bn over four years.
There may also be price controls -  perhaps voluntary -  on the private
health care sector. The president last week criticised drug companies for
the high price of vaccines for childhood illnesses.
Mr Clinton will also propose limits on the tax deductibility of executive
salaries.
The president will unveil some proposals in his state of the union message
before Congress on Wednesday. He is expected to emphasise the importance of
fairness and the benefits of progressive taxation in trying to shift public
attention from the new taxes he will propose.
He is also considering a return to Capitol Hill on Thursday for a 'question
time' session similar to the one in the British parliament.
Mr Clinton will then barnstorm across the country to blunt expected attacks
on the plan from groups representing the elderly, doctors, farmers, drug
companies and other 'special interests' who will be hurt by programme cuts
or new taxes.
Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said yesterday that Mr Clinton had
personally examined every area of the budget. Reductions, mostly in the cost
of government, will save an estimated Dollars 34bn over four years.
The president supports a proposed space station, he said but 'it won't be
done unless its billions of dollars of costs overrun are controlled'.
Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said
the economic programme will have 'no gimmicks' like the 'rosy economic
scenarios' used to produce the appearance of deficit reduction in the past.
It will provide some short-term economic stimulation and long-term
investment as well as budget reductions.

FT  15 FEB 93 / British Coal warns trustees over government pension plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL has told trustees of its two pension schemes that the
government is likely to offer coal workers the same deal on pensions as that
offered to British Rail.
The government has said that after the rail privatisation it will stop its
Pounds 70m annual contribution to the rail pension scheme, and contributions
on behalf of current workers will be paid by their new private-sector
employers.
BR's pension trustees have been offered two options for current and deferred
pensioners.
The first would require BR to turn over a significant portion of its scheme
assets to the Treasury in exchange for a promise by the government to
increase pensions in line with inflation, but there would be no further
improvements in benefits.
The other option would allow BR to keep all the assets but, if these proved
inadequate to meet pension obligations, benefits would be cut.
BR's scheme has total assets of Pounds 7.22bn, with more than 130,000
contributors and about 176,000 current and deferred pensioners.
British Coal has two schemes, one for white-collar staff and the other for
mineworkers. Between them they have about Pounds 13bn in assets, with only
72,000 contributing members but 345,000 pensioners and 277,000 deferred
pensioners.
Miss Rhoslyn Roberts, secretary of the British Coal Staff Superannuation
Scheme, said yesterday on BBC Television's Money Programme that she did not
view government regulations as a sufficient safeguard for the pensioners who
were members of her scheme.
She said: 'I think that the trustees of the staff scheme would certainly
want primary legislation to guarantee the security of pensions for the
future, if such a a proposal were to be adopted.'
Trustees have discussed in private meetings earlier this year whether they
could rely on funding promises made by one government being honoured by
successive governments without legislation.
Moreover, trustees are concerned that their present trust deed requires them
to ensure that any change leaves pensioners no worse than they had been
previously.
Both BR and British Coal pensions have been raised in line with inflation
annually, and in addition large surpluses have been used in recent years to
improve pensions -  particularly for the elderly and least-well-off.
The government's insistence that no further improvements may be made
therefore effectively worsens conditions for the pensioners.
Coal fund trustees, after a series of meetings, are said to agree that it
may be worthwhile to give up scheme assets to the Treasury if sufficient
safeguards can be offered to protect current and future benefits.
However, the trustees feel that the plans BR have been offered so far fall
short of the safeguards needed.
Trustees of BR's pension scheme, including those appointed by BR management,
are preparing a paper for government ministers outlining their concerns
about the proposals.
A BR trustee said: 'We want to talk quietly to the government about the
options. But at the end of the day, if we have Hobson's choice, then we must
take the best option.'
Among other things, the trustees will point out to the government that all
the current actuarial surplus has already been allocated to contribution
holidays and benefit enhancements.

<TEXT>
Last year's TV franchise auctions look no less ludicrous with the benefit of
hindsight. The reconfigured stations have been up and running since the
start of the year but their financial fortunes have been largely
predetermined by what the industry called the 'blind crap shoot'. The wide
array of bids has resulted in some wild share price divergences. Companies
lucky enough to have won by bidding low have done spectacularly well;
Central and Scottish are the star performers. Others, such as HTV and
Yorkshire which bid high to retain their franchises, have watched their
share prices flounder.
This simple arithmetic may get more complex as other factors enter the
equation. There is a widespread expectation of further rationalisation among
the 15 regional companies. Some share prices are twitching in anticipation.
No bids are allowed before next year. Even then, the big nine ITV companies
are not allowed to buy each other. But some of the largest companies, such
as Carlton and Granada, may take strategic shareholdings and press for a
relaxation of ownership restrictions. Overseas groups may also join the
fray.
Smaller companies, such as Anglia, could also reveal a sudden turn of speed
if advertising revenue does show real recovery. The operational gearing of
such operators should produce relatively fast rates of growth compared with
their larger peers. Promise of rising revenues and bids looks hypothetical.
But investors in the TV sector must now be used to living with uncertainty.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's Hong Kong flotation of the Denway car venture was a vivid
demonstration that investing in Chinese companies is fast becoming a
speculative mania. Doubtless Denway produces estimable products, and
double-digit growth rates in China guarantee a ready market. Still,
oversubscription of 657 times is getting out of hand.
Price/earnings multiples of shares in Chinese companies are often three
times those of Hong Kong equivalents, while disclosure and accounting
standards are lower. Even the legal status of equity holders is uncertain.
Some attempt has been made to define property in China, but it has never
been tested in the courts. Claims on assets held in joint ventures with
Chinese municipal authorities may be hard to enforce. While this may not
matter too much while things are going well, the risks are substantial.
Property investors may be the first to get their fingers burnt, with as much
as 800m sq ft of development already agreed in principle. This is far in
excess of any possible need. Only well-located projects stand a good chance
of making money.
Of course, many direct investments in China are doing well. Some ventures
export 90 per cent of their output. The low cost base produces such a quick
return that risk of heavy capital loss is minimal. But portfolio investment
requires a level of scepticism which is currently out of fashion. An
overheating Chinese economy may dampen interest in large flotations such as
Shanghai Petrochemical, due later this year. For the time being, fear has
yet to conquer greed.

FT  15 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England may come to regret remaining aloof to the commercial
fortunes of the gilt-edged market makers. It could not stop the government
rushing into last month's interest rate cut in the middle of a gilts
auction. But that should not lead it to belittle the losses incurred by
market makers as a result. The gilts market has shown a consistently poor
return on capital since Big Bang. Even allowing for recent arrivals such as
Deutsche Bank and Nikko, capital committed to the market declined from
Pounds 600m in 1986 to little more than Pounds 400m last year.
In the days of public sector debt repayment, that was hardly a concern. But
set against the Pounds 50bn government borrowing programme in 1993-94, the
gilts market looks thinly capitalised. That will cramp the authorities'
funding style. Under the Bank's own prudential rules, the market-makers in
aggregate are forbidden from running long positions much in excess of Pounds
5bn from one day to the next. Even allowing that institutional investors can
place bids direct, there is little scope for replacing the current ad hoc
combination of medium-sized auctions and taps with a more predictable
timetable of large auctions.
That will disappoint reformers. Giant auctions which result in large and
therefore liquid individual issues might attract foreign money. While the
conduct of UK monetary policy remains so unpredictable, though, there may be
virtue in necessity. The failure of a large auction -  even for a reason
beyond the Bank's control, such as an unexpected rise in interest rates -
would blow a serious hole in the funding programme.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kingfisher's flirtation with the French electrical chain Darty is reviving
debate about the merits of overseas retail expansion. As Kingfisher must be
anxiously aware, the precedents are scarcely propitious. In the 1980s, a
wave of UK retailers tried to expand in the US by splashing out almost
Dollars 9bn on acquisitions. With precious few exceptions, they have
produced dismal returns. Dixons' unhappy experience with Silo is the latest
entry in the encyclopaedia of woe. Pessimists fear that as UK retailers turn
to mainland Europe they will simply throw their money away again.
But there are significant differences between the two regions. The most
obvious is that mainland Europe is closer, which makes control easier. While
Marks and Spencer's North American business is based in New York, for
example, it can oversee its more successful European operations from London.
There are also scale advantages from operating across Europe as the single
market becomes a reality. Kingfisher will doubtless stress such arguments.
It will also help soothe operational doubts by pointing out that Darty's
management will continue to run the business if the deal goes through. Darty
is certainly a sound business in as stable a market as Europe can offer.
Still, the safer route to international expansion lies through organic
growth as the likes of Ikea, Toys R Us, and C&amp;A have successfully proved.
This can take generations. Kingfisher wants quicker results. The price is
higher risk.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Duopoly power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE on how to save British miners' jobs seems to have come down to
whether the government can persuade the two large power generators, British
Coal's main customers, to buy more coal. Cajoling companies to buy what they
would not otherwise wish to buy is bad politics and worse economics. If
political considerations require such purchases, the least bad solution is
for the costs to be entirely transparent.
The snag is that, even if British Coal is subsidised so that its prices can
fall to world market levels, National Power and PowerGen may not want to buy
enough coal to get the government out of its corner. This has led to
suggestions that the generators should be given extra incentives to buy yet
more coal.
Fortunately, it looks as though the government intends to reject one such
option - delaying liberalisation of the electricity distribution market,
which is largely monopolised by the regional electricity companies. Such a
delay would keep electricity prices high.
But there are signs that the government may be tempted towards actions which
would delay the creation of a more competitive generating market. Hints have
been dropped that, if the generators do not buy enough coal, they will be
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which could break them up
into smaller competing units. The implication is that, if they do, they will
not be referred.
Any such political arm-twisting would not only be an unhealthy interference
with the commercial decisions of private companies. It would also be an
unwise use of the threat of MMC referrals.
A decision on whether or not to refer the power duopoly to the MMC should
not be taken by the government for political reasons, but by Mr Stephen
Littlechild, director general for electricity supply, for economic ones.
There is already evidence that the duopoly does not work to customers'
advantage, and Mr Littlechild has said he will decide by 1995 whether to
make a referral. The government should do nothing that constrains Mr
Littlechild's ability to make a reference.
If this leaves the government with a problem of persuading the generators to
buy enough coal to fix its political problem, the way out would be to
increase the coal subsidy until they are willing to do so. The full cost of
saving miners' jobs would then be in the open. It would also be less than
the hidden cost of uncompetitive markets.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Optimistic state of the unions: Martin Dickson and Nikki
Tait on whether Clinton will prove as amenable as the US labour movement
hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Clinton's election theme tune was 'Don't stop thinking about tomorrow',
by the pop group Fleetwood Mac. Now that the Democratic candidate is safely
installed in the White House, the hopes of the US labour movement might be
summed up by another Fleetwood Mac recording, 'Come a little bit closer'.
After 12 years of strongly anti-union Republican administrations, the
American labour movement is expecting a more friendly and productive
relationship with the Clinton White House.
The first piece of legislation signed into law by Mr Clinton, on February 4,
was the family leave bill, which guarantees workers up to 12 weeks' unpaid
time off for family medical emergencies.
Shortly before that, Mr Clinton took a symbolically important step in
revoking two orders, passed by President George Bush in the run-up to last
year's election. One required federal contractors to post notices informing
workers of their rights not to pay union dues; the other prohibited
contractors on federally funded construction contracts from requiring
workers to be union members.
Mr Clinton is also considering lifting the rule imposed by President Ronald
Reagan on those involved in the 1981 air traffic controllers' strike,
barring them from employment by the federal government.
The labour movement hopes these early gestures will be followed by more
far-reaching action - both in terms of specific legislation and the general
climate of industrial relations. However, it is not simply relying on the
swing of the political pendulum to improve its fortunes. Many - though far
from all - of its leaders are co-operating with management to make
individual companies and industries more competitive, thus saving union
jobs.
For example, United Steelworkers last month proposed a new form of
collective bargaining, involving long-term labour contracts and more
flexible working patterns in return for job security and worker involvement
in decision-making.
According to Mr Lynn Williams, the union's leader: 'When it comes to
dividing up the pie, we'll be adversaries. But now we have to grow the pie,
and that means working together.'
For the unions, it is a question of survival. Their high-water mark was in
1945, when union members accounted for 35.5 per cent of the labour force.
The figure now is only 15.8 per cent. Unions remain much stronger in the
public sector, with nearly 37 per cent of employees in the labour movement.
If government workers are excluded, less than 12 per cent of the US
workforce belongs to a union.
Several forces have been at work. One is the changing sectoral make-up of US
industry and its geographical distribution.
The past 20 years have seen a sharp drop in employment in America's heavy
manufacturing industries, such as steel and automobiles, located in the
northern 'rust-belt' states. Job growth has been concentrated in the
high-technology and service sectors, which are harder to unionise, and in
the conservative southern states, which have a tradition of hostility to
unions.
Examples of successful southern-based non-union companies range from Nucor,
the steel mini-mill operator, to Wal-Mart, now the largest US retailer,
employing 375,000 people. Plants established in the US by Japanese car
companies are not unionised, though their joint ventures with US
manufacturers are.
Many of these newer companies, appreciating the flexibility in working
practices that a non-union labour force offers, have assiduously cultivated
'liberal' employee relations. Wal-Mart, for example, always refers to its
workers as 'associates'. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, where only the
pilots are unionised, prides itself on never laying off employees.
Such long-term economic and social forces have been reinforced since the
start of the 1980s by an anti-union political atmosphere. The significant
event was Mr Reagan's success in 1981 in breaking the strike by the
government-employed Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organisation. By
replacing Patco workers with non-union labour, he set an example that many
other companies followed, or at least threatened to follow.
It was management's threat to replace striking workers that finally broke
the nerve of United Auto Workers' members last year after a long strike at
Caterpillar, the earth-moving equipment manufacturer.
Examples like this, together with the recent recession which has made
workers fearful of losing their jobs, help explain why, last year, the
number of big strikes and lock-outs at US companies reached their lowest
level in 45 years.
That said, big stoppages do still take place. Earlier this month, the United
Mine Workers began a strike at Peabody, the coalmining subsidiary of
Britain's Hanson group, as part of an industry-wide dispute over a
labour/management contract.
If the dispute escalates into a full-scale coalminers' strike, it could
prove a first test of the Clinton administration's willingness to step into
big labour disputes as a last-ditch mediator.
But the union movement's expectations for the Clinton administration go far
beyond strike mediation, based in part on the belief that the new president
has electoral debts to pay members who fought hard last year for a
Democratic victory. Roughly 25 per cent of Mr Clinton's vote came from union
households.
Four common themes run through most unions demands: legislation to prevent
the replacement of striking unionists; an economic package to boost
employment and investment in the infrastructure and inner cities; reform of
the US healthcare system, which leaves many Americans without decent
coverage; and changes to the free-trade agreement with Mexico negotiated by
the Bush administration, which the unions fear will mean a loss of jobs to
cheap labour markets south of the border.
Mr Clinton's precise policies on many of these issues remain unclear and the
unions may find him less amenable to their agenda than they would like. On
the trade agreement, for example, he is thought to favour relatively minor
changes to the Bush package.
The administration is, however, committed to signing a bill that would
prevent a company from permanently replacing a striking worker, although it
is not certain the bill will be passed by Congress.
If it is, it could revive the strike as an industrial relations weapon. Yet
many unions - and corporate managements - recognise that the pressures of
domestic and foreign competition and changes in the organisation of work
make a less adversarial relationship necessary.
Many companies are devolving responsibility down the line to workers
('empowering them', in the fashionable jargon), while workers are becoming
more flexible in the tasks they are prepared to handle, abandoning
entrenched job demarcation lines.
At National Steel, which is majority-owned by Japan's NKK, management/union
relations are so good that the company has signed a 'neutrality agreement',
meaning that it does not oppose union efforts to organise new parts of the
business. As a result, the union has even signed up the white-collar workers
at headquarters.
But the path to better relations is far from easy, as underlined by recent
friction at Saturn, the General Motors car company, which was set up in the
1980s as a shining example of the best manufacturing and labour practices.
In a referendum at the end of last month, some 29 per cent of Saturn's
workers said they would like to end the current management/union
co-operation arrangement and go back to a traditional arm's-length
relationship. These workers felt their union leaders had grown too cosy with
Saturn's management.
GM will also provide one of the most important labour relations negotiations
of 1993. The UAW's three-year contract with the Big Three Detroit
manufacturers runs out in the autumn and GM, its North American operations
struggling to return to profit, will want substantial concessions from the
union on health coverage and other benefits. The UAW, angry at the company's
plant closure programme, may not find it easy to co-operate.
It could, in short, be a particularly significant litmus test of 1990s
co-operation versus the bad old days of confrontation.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Unnecessary EC recession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WATCHING THE European Community's economy has become like watching a crash
in slow motion. With the bumpers already crumpled, the question is whether
the occupants will survive. Only last week one driver, Mr Jacques Delors,
argued that 'the very idea of a united Europe is in peril'. But what does he
suggest? That the EC should drive further in the same direction.
Hard times breed conspiracy theories. Many, for example, blame current woes
on 'speculators'. Some go still further. Mr Raymond Barre, former French
finance minister, argued last week that some people were determined to
prevent the creation of European economic and monetary union by blowing up
the EMS. Such theories rest on the assumption that the largest and most
liquid market in the world -  foreign exchange - can be manipulated by
private institutions more effectively than by central banks.
It makes more sense to ask whether 'speculators' have reasons for acting as
they have. They do. Suppose, for example, that an investor believes there is
a 20 per cent chance of a 5 per cent devaluation of the French franc against
the D-Mark over the next three months. That would be quite enough to justify
the current interest rate premium on three-month money of nearly 4
percentage points. Is it unreasonable for investors to believe this? Hardly.
Why, after all, should they believe that a new French government will
tolerate what seems to be an unnecessary recession, especially if rising
unemployment turns out to cause an overwhelming defeat for the current
government?
It is not enough to agree that the realignments might have come sooner. The
problems facing the EC are more fundamental. The truth is that, however
beneficial it may be in normal circumstances, the ERM is unable to cope with
the unique problems created by German unification.
The initial consequence of German unification had to be a real appreciation
of the D-Mark, in order to allow resources previously exported through the
current account surplus to be used within the German economy. Such an
appreciation could, indeed, have been achieved by earlier acceptance of the
realignments wanted by the Bundesbank. But unification had the additional
and probably inescapable consequence of raising German interest rates,
especially at shorter maturities. Higher interest rates in the ERM's anchor
currency became the floor everywhere else. As investors came to realise how
inappropriate those interest rates were for the EC as a whole, the higher
interest rate premiums had to become.
High real interest rates cannot be evaded by realignments alone, unless
those realignments are large enough to offset the deflationary effects of
the interest rates or to persuade the Bundesbank to keep interest rates
down. Thus the position advanced by Mr Delors last week -  that there need
be nothing wrong with realignments, provided there are fundamental economic
divergences between members and the realignments themselves are not a
'wildcat' affair -  misses the point.
Because the principal difficulty is not inadequate competitiveness vis-a-vis
Germany, but high real interest rates, temporary bands wide enough to allow
a country such as France to put its short-term interest rates below German
levels would seem the rational response. But the ERM would be transformed by
this means into a managed float, which is what most European governments
abhor.
What remains is hanging on. Maybe the 'glimmer of hope' identified by Mr
Delors in the Bundesbank's recent easing will soon become a flood of light.
That is, indeed, the only way to combine the present ERM with satisfactory
economic performance throughout the EC. But will the Bundesbank oblige? It
seems unlikely. In the last resort Germany might offer accelerated monetary
union to France and a few other countries. Yet this too is no safe solution.
Such a union might not be on offer. It may also not ease French interest
rates that much, while exacerbating political tensions within the EC.
The causes of the current discontents are not just that the EC offers toil,
tears and sweat, but that it offers unnecessary toil, tears and sweat. Maybe
this is just an unavoidable episode on the EC's journey to economic and
monetary union. But it is increasingly difficult to see why.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What alchemy is brewing at Yorkshire-based fine chemicals company MTM, now
progressing towards a rescue refinancing with its banks?
Almost a year after being ousted as chairman, MTM's Richard Lines has just
sold his 7 per cent share stake to one of Sweden's more controversial
businessmen -  Egyptian-born Refaat El-Sayed. Meanwhile, it's not gone
unnoticed that Lines has found an office in Stockton-on-Tees, across the
corridor from another ex-ICI man and member of the Teeside speciality
chemicals mafia, Michael Marshall, who was deposed as executive chairman of
yet another chemical company, Ellis &amp; Everard, last July.
Like Lines, Marshall is sitting on a tidy personal fortune, as is MTM's new
chairman, Ken Schofield, who made a lot of money selling his own company to
Hickson and then turning it round.
The similarities don't end there. All three are first and foremost
deal-makers no doubt imbued with a touch of mutual rivalry. They first mixed
30 years back when Lines was Marshall's boss at ICI, and both sold chemicals
to Schofield, then at Manro.
So what, if anything, might all this wealth and knowledge have to do with
MTM? El-Sayed and Lines will say nothing of their intentions. But it is hard
to imagine that anyone is better qualified to know what a bombed-out company
like MTM is really worth than its founder Richard Lines, or MTM's current
boss, the well-regarded Schofield. Sounds like the ingredients for an
explosive recipe.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever happened to 'budget purdah' - the 2 1/2 month period between New
Year and the budget when Treasury ministers are not meant to comment in
public on possible tax changes or other economic and financial matters
relevant to the budget.
Her Majesty's Treasury insists that nothing has changed. Security is as
strict as ever in the run-up to next month's budget. However, judging by the
recent outpourings of more telegenic Treasury ministers, such as Michael
Portillo and Stephen Dorrell, there seem to be differring ideas on what
constitutes purdah.
The Sunday Telegraph, for example, wanted Michael Portillo to write about
his plans for reforming the welfare state yesterday. First he agreed, but
then the Treasury's purdah patrol got to hear of it and he changed his mind.
The recent surprise base rate cut might have been better handled if Treasury
ministers had not been hidden away in purdah.
One ominous sign is that the chancellor's annual Mansion House speech, where
he talks about monetary policy, has been brought forward from late October
to June 15. Surely this can't be an excuse for an even longer period of
ministerial silence in the run-up to the December budget?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Notwithstanding last week's unprecedented disclosures about the state of
Britain's royal finances, one small question continues to niggle. If the
Queen is as relatively poor as her Lord Chamberlain insists, then either she
inherited far less money than was thought or her traditional financial
advisers have not been doing much of a job. Time, for a change of investment
advisers, perhaps?

FT  15 FEB 93 / Observer: End of the SABC show
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Broadcasting Corporation is not the only national broadcaster
seeking new governors at a particularly critical time in its affairs. The
South African Broadcasting Corporation has an even more urgent need since
its board expires next month.
No institution has done more to consolidate the 45-year rule of white
Afrikaners in South Africa than the SABC propaganda machine. Hence, it is
ironic that the ruling National Party has had a deathbed conversion to the
virtues of independent broadcasting -  on the principle, no doubt, that the
African National Congress should be prevented from committing the kinds of
media abuses which were National Party policy for nearly five decades.
Whereas the National Party used to pack the upper echelons of the SABC with
members of the Afrikaner Broederbond, Pretoria now wants a board which
commands 'the widest possible acceptability'. This is much harder than it
sounds because it is hard to remain apolitical in South Africa and the SABC
will be one of the most potent weapons in the forthcoming non-racial
elections.
Non-broadcasters might be the best option. Novelist Nadine Gordimer has been
mentioned, along with the former editor of the now defunct liberal daily,
the Rand Daily Mail, Raymond Louw. But in the meantime, there are suspicions
that the SABC is trying to pre-empt the planned changes by making biased
appointments within the 'black' news and current affairs section. Old habits
die hard.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Optimistic state of the unions / Whether Clinton will prove
as amenable as the US labour movement hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bill Clinton's election theme tune was 'Don't stop thinking about
tomorrow', by the pop group Fleetwood Mac. Now that the Democratic candidate
is safely installed in the White House, the hopes of the US labour movement
might be summed up by another Fleetwood Mac recording, 'Come a little bit
closer'.
After 12 years of strongly anti-union Republican administrations, the
American labour movement is expecting a more friendly and productive
relationship with the Clinton White House.
The first piece of legislation signed into law by Mr Clinton, on February 4,
was the family leave bill, which guarantees workers up to 12 weeks' unpaid
time off for family medical emergencies.
Shortly before that, Mr Clinton took a symbolically important step in
revoking two orders, passed by President George Bush in the run-up to last
year's election. One required federal contractors to post notices informing
workers of their rights not to pay union dues; the other prohibited
contractors on federally funded construction contracts from requiring
workers to be union members.
Mr Clinton is also considering lifting the rule imposed by President Ronald
Reagan on those involved in the 1981 air traffic controllers' strike,
barring them from employment by the federal government.
The labour movement hopes these early gestures will be followed by more
far-reaching action -  both in terms of specific legislation and the general
climate of industrial relations. However, it is not simply relying on the
swing of the political pendulum to improve its fortunes. Many -  though far
from all -  of its leaders are co-operating with management to make
individual companies and industries more competitive, thus saving union
jobs.
For example, United Steelworkers last month proposed a new form of
collective bargaining, involving long-term labour contracts and more
flexible working patterns in return for job security and worker involvement
in decision-making.
According to Mr Lynn Williams, the union's leader: 'When it comes to
dividing up the pie, we'll be adversaries. But now we have to grow the pie,
and that means working together.'
For the unions, it is a question of survival. Their high-water mark was in
1945, when union members accounted for 35.5 per cent of the labour force.
The figure now is only 15.8 per cent. Unions remain much stronger in the
public sector, with nearly 37 per cent of employees in the labour movement.
If government workers are excluded, less than 12 per cent of the US
workforce belongs to a union.
Several forces have been at work. One is the changing sectoral make-up of US
industry and its geographical distribution.
The past 20 years have seen a sharp drop in employment in America's heavy
manufacturing industries, such as steel and automobiles, located in the
northern 'rust-belt' states. Job growth has been concentrated in the
high-technology and service sectors, which are harder to unionise, and in
the conservative southern states, which have a tradition of hostility to
unions.
Examples of successful southern-based non-union companies range from Nucor,
the steel mini-mill operator, to Wal-Mart, now the largest US retailer,
employing 375,000 people. Plants established in the US by Japanese car
companies are not unionised, though their joint ventures with US
manufacturers are.
Many of these newer companies, appreciating the flexibility in working
practices that a non-union labour force offers, have assiduously cultivated
'liberal' employee relations. Wal-Mart, for example, always refers to its
workers as 'associates'. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, where only the
pilots are unionised, prides itself on never laying off employees.
Such long-term economic and social forces have been reinforced since the
start of the 1980s by an anti-union political atmosphere. The significant
event was Mr Reagan's success in 1981 in breaking the strike by the
government-employed Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organisation. By
replacing Patco workers with non-union labour, he set an example that many
other companies followed, or at least threatened to follow.
It was management's threat to replace striking workers that finally broke
the nerve of United Auto Workers' members last year after a long strike at
Caterpillar, the earth-moving equipment manufacturer.
Examples like this, together with the recent recession which has made
workers fearful of losing their jobs, help explain why, last year, the
number of big strikes and lock-outs at US companies reached their lowest
level in 45 years.
That said, big stoppages do still take place. Earlier this month, the United
Mine Workers began a strike at Peabody, the coalmining subsidiary of
Britain's Hanson group, as part of an industry-wide dispute over a
labour/management contract.
If the dispute escalates into a full-scale coalminers' strike, it could
prove a first test of the Clinton administration's willingness to step into
big labour disputes as a last-ditch mediator.
But the union movement's expectations for the Clinton administration go far
beyond strike mediation, based in part on the belief that the new president
has electoral debts to pay members who fought hard last year for a
Democratic victory. Roughly 25 per cent of Mr Clinton's vote came from union
households.
Four common themes run through most unions demands: legislation to prevent
the replacement of striking unionists; an economic package to boost
employment and investment in the infrastructure and inner cities; reform of
the US healthcare system, which leaves many Americans without decent
coverage; and changes to the free-trade agreement with Mexico negotiated by
the Bush administration, which the unions fear will mean a loss of jobs to
cheap labour markets south of the border.
Mr Clinton's precise policies on many of these issues remain unclear and the
unions may find him less amenable to their agenda than they would like. On
the trade agreement, for example, he is thought to favour relatively minor
changes to the Bush package.
The administration is, however, committed to signing a bill that would
prevent a company from permanently replacing a striking worker, although it
is not certain the bill will be passed by Congress.
If it is, it could revive the strike as an industrial relations weapon. Yet
many unions -  and corporate managements -  recognise that the pressures of
domestic and foreign competition and changes in the organisation of work
make a less adversarial relationship necessary.
Many companies are devolving responsibility down the line to workers
('empowering them', in the fashionable jargon), while workers are becoming
more flexible in the tasks they are prepared to handle, abandoning
entrenched job demarcation lines.
At National Steel, which is majority-owned by Japan's NKK, management/union
relations are so good that the company has signed a 'neutrality agreement',
meaning that it does not oppose union efforts to organise new parts of the
business. As a result, the union has even signed up the white-collar workers
at headquarters.
But the path to better relations is far from easy, as underlined by recent
friction at Saturn, the General Motors car company, which was set up in the
1980s as a shining example of the best manufacturing and labour practices.
In a referendum at the end of last month, some 29 per cent of Saturn's
workers said they would like to end the current management/union
co-operation arrangement and go back to a traditional arm's-length
relationship. These workers felt their union leaders had grown too cosy with
Saturn's management.
GM will also provide one of the most important labour relations negotiations
of 1993. The UAW's three-year contract with the Big Three Detroit
manufacturers runs out in the autumn and GM, its North American operations
struggling to return to profit, will want substantial concessions from the
union on health coverage and other benefits. The UAW, angry at the company's
plant closure programme, may not find it easy to co-operate.
It could, in short, be a particularly significant litmus test of 1990s
co-operation versus the bad old days of confrontation.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Buthelezi's role
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE power-sharing proposals agreed by the South Africa government and the
African National Congress (ANC) are a victory for pragmatism.
The time is now ripe for Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, to join
President FW de Klerk and invite the World Bank and other donors to support
health, education and housing programmes to help redress the apartheid
legacy. The sooner efforts get under way to meet the aspirations of black
South Africans, the better prospects for a new administration.
But first it is imperative that the proposals encompass Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader. There are many hurdles to be overcome, such
as: how will executive decisions in a multi-party administration be reached;
the composition of the security forces and who will be in control; what
powers will devolve to regions; and what happens when the five-year
agreement ends. But none is as formidable as that which would be presented
by an alienated Zulu leader.
His denunciation of the agreement over the weekend augurs ill. Thousands
have died in the feud between Inkatha and the ANC during the past three
years. His warning of possible bloodshed if the government and the ANC tried
to impose their plans is chilling.
Elections for a constituent assembly, envisaged under the proposals, will
almost certainly provoke further violence unless Inkatha participates.
However exasperated ANC and government negotiators may be by Chief
Buthelezi's role as a 'spoiler' in the talks so far -  he pulled out of
talks last September, and then published a constitution for Natal province
which would amount to a unilateral declaration of independence  - they must
not lose sight of the fact that his participation is essential.
They are inclined to threaten that unless he 'sees sense', they will rule
South Africa without him. Nothing could be more dangerous.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Modest repairs to ERM 'fault lines'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British prime minister, John Major, is likely to be remembered for at
least one phrase -  'fault lines in the ERM'. Investigations of sorts have
begun into ways of improving the functioning of the mechanism in two forums:
the EC's Monetary Committee based in Brussels and the Committee of Central
Bank Governors.
The main thought beginning to emerge is that it is not the 'fault lines' but
misaligned parities which have been responsible for recent convulsions,
particularly in Italy and Britain.
The following themes have so far occupied the discussion:
The attempt to operate the ERM as a set of permanently fixed parities in
1987-92 was premature. More systematic international study needs to be made
to spot currency misalignments in advance and make necessary adjustments
before they are forced by the markets.
This might be helped if some international body can take the initiative. The
most likely candidate, on which some on the British side seem keen, is the
European Monetary Institute, to start in 1994, with the inauguration of
Stage Two of European Monetary Union. It is likely to be based in Bonn and
headed by Mr Wim Duisenberg of the Dutch central bank.
The inclinations of some French policymakers -  although not of officials at
the sharp end -  for narrower ERM margins have been offset by the
Bundesbank's belief that if there are any changes they should be made
towards wider ones. As a result, no changes are likely.
There has been some not very well-defined pressure for 'greater symmetry' of
burden-sharing between strong and weak currencies. How this can be
introduced without weakening the duty of Germany, or any other future anchor
country, to give priority to fighting inflation has not been explained.
German representatives have countered that they in fact lose because
repayment obligations are not in D-marks, but in Ecus.
The Bundesbank for its part has expressed unhappiness at the theoretical
commitment to unlimited intervention when currencies are up against their
margins in their ERM grid.
The above three points are likely to be bypassed by putting greater emphasis
on discretionary intervention to protect currencies well before they reach
their limits.
Many of the above themes were already present in the Basle-Nyborg agreement
in the late 1980s. Much the most important of them is the intention to
reintroduce more frequent parity changes.
The very limited realignments which are possible within the ERM margins
raise problems both of market management and of a more fundamental kind.
Take one current example. Should the French franc appreciate or depreciate
against the D-mark? On the so-called fundamentals -  prices, costs, budgets
and the balance of payments -  the franc should appreciate. There are,
however, a few French economists who say that these benefits are bought at
the expense of high and rising unemployment and that the franc should
depreciate instead.
France could not be treated in isolation. German unemployment is also
rising; and the EMI would have eventually to be redrawn into guessing
so-called 'fundamental equilibrium exchange rates'. This is like looking in
a dark room for a black cat which is not there.
French and German officials can say that the arguments for changing the
franc/D-mark parity in opposite directions offset each other and only
underline the case for stability. But even if they can ride through the
period up to and after the French elections, there will be other even more
difficult cases.
The Fed does not attempt to calculate fundamental equilibrium exchange rates
for all the US states, but simply takes for granted that the costs of having
separate currencies outweigh the benefits, and bases its monetary policy on
average US experience. This is the way in which European monetary policy
will have to develop -  or move to a looser ERM with much wider margins than
any now contemplated.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: No Captain Bligh, but a builder of real teams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN RIDGWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the wake of so much criticism of the media in the past year, I have
had the opportunity to follow recent press coverage of myself with fairly
good humour. But I feel perhaps I ought to reply to John van Maurik's letter
(February 3), in which he likens me to the Captain Bligh, another gentleman
whom history has proven was wrongly maligned.
It surprises me that a man in van Maurik's position of commercial reality
should be so naive as to believe that this film would be any more than a
means of grabbing high viewing figures to sell advertising space on Channel
4. Why else would a 10-person film crew come 700 miles up here to film me,
when it is so much cheaper to film him in action in Bromley?
Does van Maurik believe, for one minute, that Patricia Morison, in
researching for 27.25 column inches of space in the FT, would waste just
five minutes checking her facts with me? Does it matter in the slightest,
that she should make a hard factual error such as stating 'Rockwater had
asked for an extra tough course, for which it paid Pounds 25,000', when the
actual cost was Pounds 10,560? Why bother? Why let the facts get in the way
of a good story?
My experience of life has led me to believe in the largely untapped power of
the human spirit. I believe it is people who make success, rather than
systems. My courses are designed to build real teams. When I sat the
Rockwater team featured in the programme around a table, before their chief
executive, 50 miles from the railway, then it was up to him: real
team-building, real business. But there was not enough action in this; it
threatened to diminish those much more vital, viewing figures.
Finally, I would ask van Maurik to spell my name correctly -  little slips
could have cost me my life so many times over the years. And, after all, it
was just a small slip which recently allowed the people of tiny Wales to
defeat the systems of gigantic England.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Limited route for saving tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRISTOPHER FRENCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the article 'Vehicles to catch before it's too late' in your
Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (January 29) it is suggested that an
individual receiving interest gross from a bank or building society account
could save tax by closing and then reopening a savings account. This would
take advantage of the 'prior year basis' of assessment, and falling interest
rates, by ensuring that the tax charge this year was on a lower figure.
Generally, this is appropriate only for interest received from the National
Savings Bank. Otherwise, interest will in the main only be paid without
deduction of tax by a bank or building society to an individual where the
depositor has registered on Inland Revenue form R85 as a person not expected
to be liable to tax. If that expectation is realised, no tax will be payable
in any event.
Second, and more importantly, the 'prior year basis' of assessment ceased to
apply to such interest from April 1991. Such interest is now assessed on the
'current year basis'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADRIAN WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Can you have quoted Mr Colquhoun, secretary of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, correctly ('Heseltine laments
oversupply of accountants', February 6) as saying that accountants control
many highly successful companies such as BTR, Glaxo and Grand Metropolitan?
Surely, highly successful companies are run by excellent directors and
managers, whether they be accountants, engineers or scientists. Sir Paul
Girolami, an accountant, made this very point most eloquently in an
interview reported in Director, November 1992: 'If I were to run Glaxo as an
accountant we wouldn't get started.'
Sir Paul is also a Fellow of the Institute of Management Consultants, yet
the last thing in my mind to assert is that Glaxo is controlled by a
management consultant. I do not doubt that Mr Colquhoun takes the same view
of accountants.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Hard look at defence spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BEN JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You rightly note with concern the British government's volte face on planned
military cuts, at the cost of Pounds 80m to the taxpayer ('Rethinking
British defence', February 10), just as Germany and the US are looking at
further cuts in their own budgets.
The government and the defence select committee would not only do well to
look hard and long at the imperial nostalgia which often propels Britain's
disproportionate defence budget, as you suggest, but also to scrutinise the
spending's effectiveness in dealing with the big threats to global security
in a post-cold war world.
To be well-spent, resources will have to be channelled not towards
fire-fighting conflicts after the event, but increasingly towards tackling
the root causes of the 'new' threats to global security, such as: the
vicious cycles of economic crisis; poverty and conflict which drive millions
in desperation from their homes and across the world's borders; or a drugs
trade propelled by the desperation of peasant farmers forced to grow coca as
traditional crops such as coffee slump to prices which do not pay a living
wage; or the poverty and gross inequality upon which totalitarianism and
fundamentalism feed.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Little engine who can't: Rail faces an uphill struggle in
boosting its share of the freight market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rail freight is a bit like motherhood and apple pie: everyone agrees it is a
good thing, if the alternative is juggernauts thundering through their towns
and villages. Everyone, apparently, except Britain's freight carriers.
In the last few weeks, there has been an exodus of freight from rail.
Hundreds of thousands of tonnes have switched to road in response to price
increases imposed by British Rail. Even before that, the UK's rail freight
industry was in a parlous state. Now it is shrinking to the point where it
seems possible to ask whether it has any future at all.
Once the question would have been dismissed as ludicrous. Rail dominated the
freight industry for a century until well after the second world war. But
since 1955, when cheaper and more flexible road transport first started to
outstrip it, rail freight has been in remorseless decline. Today, it
accounts for barely 10 per cent of inland tonnage moved.
The explanation is straightforward enough. Rail freight is best suited to
the movement of large quantities of heavy bulk commodities such as coal,
iron ore or steel from one rail-connected point to another. A good example
is BR's highly profitable business moving coal from pits to power stations
on so-called merry-go-round trains.
The decline of rail freight in Britain mirrors the changing structure of
British industry. Rail's heyday came at a time when British manufacturing
was dominated by heavy industries concentrated in huge industrial plants,
each with their own railway siding. Today's manufacturing is lighter and
highly dispersed -  and modern management techniques require it to deliver
its products in small batches 'just in time', not by the trainload once a
week.
Even so, it might seem puzzling that rail cannot offer an alternative to the
long-distance lorry traffic pounding up the motorway from, say, London to
Manchester. Surely it would make sense to put 30 or more lorry loads at a
time on to a single train hauled by one engine with one driver?
It might, if only the railways went where the freight wanted to go. As it
is, the freight has to be taken by road to the nearest railhead, unloaded
onto a freight wagon, formed into a train for the long-distance part of the
haul, then unloaded on to another lorry for delivery to its final
destination. So costly are these transfers between road and rail, and so
cheap is the road transport alternative, that the economics only shift in
rail's favour for distances of 500 miles or more -  far greater than the
average freight haul in a country as small as Britain.
The result is that BR nowadays carries an astonishingly narrow range of
freight. Most of it is bulk commodities: coal, steel, aggregates and fuel.
The rest is mainly container traffic from ports, which can be unloaded
directly onto rail without a costly road transfer and transported to
regional distribution centres for collection.
Now, even these few remaining freight flows are in jeopardy. The biggest -
coal -  is threatened by pit closures. On top of that, about 2m tonnes of
other freight has been lost to road transport in the past few weeks as a
result of price increases imposed by BR. The reason for those is that BR's
freight operations are unsubsidised, and BR is under a long-standing
government remit to turn them into profit. It is lagging badly behind -
they lost Pounds 51m last year.
So is this the end of the line for rail freight in Britain? Not quite,
perhaps. There are a couple of bright spots on the horizon. One is the
opening of the Channel tunnel, which will link Britain's railway system with
France's and make rail a more attractive option for long-haul freight
traffic to the Continent.
More significant for domestic rail freight, however, is the prospect of
railway privatisation. Theoretically, if one accepts that private enterprise
is more efficient than the public sector, this should bring costs down and
make rail more competitive with road. But privatisation also carries a
threat -  the current level of BR's freight losses implies that a great deal
more traffic will have to be shed before the freight businesses are
profitable enough to be sold.
There is, however, another wrinkle to privatisation. Last week Mr John
MacGregor, the transport secretary, responded to widespread concern over
rail freight's decline by outlining a surprise package of assistance for the
industry as part of the privatisation package.
Lorries involved in combined transport operations -  that is, switching
their loads to rail for the long-distance part of their journey - would be
allowed to operate to a maximum weight of 44 tonnes instead of the 38 tonnes
now permitted. And a new system of grants would offer freight operators
money towards the cost of equipment and track charges if that was what it
took to persuade them to use rail in preference to road.
The second of these is a bold step. But the government has yet to indicate
what its budget for these grants will be. Given the constraints on public
spending, is it likely to be able to pay enough to make a significant
difference?
Under a more modest system of grants already in operation, rail freight
operators can claim up to 60 per cent of the cost of certain capital
equipment. So if a company spends Pounds 5m on a fleet of 25 rail wagons and
two terminals for loading and unloading, it might qualify for Pounds 3m in
grant over a 10-year period. In that time, those rail wagons might typically
shift 12.5m tonnes of freight. On that basis, the subsidy works out at 24p a
tonne.
It doesn't sound much. But to put things in perspective, some 1.6bn tonnes
of freight was moved by road last year. That suggests that shifting 10 per
cent of it to rail would cost Pounds 38.4m a year in subsidies. And with
lorry traffic forecast to double by 2025, the bill for halting that growth
would soar ever higher.
There is, of course, another solution. If rail cannot compete with road on
price, an alternative to subsidising rail is to make road transport more
expensive. The government already seems to be heading in this direction. Mr
MacGregor has announced plans to bring out a green paper this spring paving
the way for tolls on trunk roads and motorways, and is sympathetic towards
the idea of road pricing in urban areas.
But neither road pricing nor subsidies -  nor both combined -  will reverse
the roles of rail and road in freight. Most road freight nowadays would not
switch to rail at any price because railways cannot provide the same
flexibility. Railways will never deliver food to high street stores, nor
collect it from the farms where it was produced. They are destined to stay
on the margin of freight, doing only what they do best. The only question is
how wide that margin is -  and how much society is prepared to pay for it.

<TEXT>
Sir, You wrongly assert that the status quo as regards funding of the social
housing stock must remain.
Currently, annual incremental demand for government-funded housing
association properties far outweighs the buildings which record funding of
Pounds 2bn a year can support at 72 per cent grant levels. This is in part a
result of high unemployment in the pit of a recession. But it also reflects
the young and mobile that are disinclined to buy homes in a falling market
(although they can afford them) being forced into social housing because the
private rental stock is inadequate. There can be nothing wrong in housing
associations tapping this demand at higher rent levels than are the norm
rather than setting rents for all properties at levels those least well off
can afford. The housing associations can cross-subsidise the needy and when
this fails housing benefit can tide tenants over what may be a temporary
shortfall in income. It must be better to direct subsidy at those who need
it now.
Clearly targeting finite subsidy in the social housing sector does not alone
constitute a housing policy. The challenge for government is to break free
from a hotchpotch of past practice, some good, and some indefensible, to
conduct a review of housing policy that is not restricted to the social
sector but spans all forms of tenure. Such a radical review would explore
how we can both promote job mobility and ensure affordable accommodation for
all households.
But it cannot start if existing subsidies are seen as immutable.

   From Mr DONALD HOODLESS

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader on housing policy neatly highlighted the dilemma facing
housing associations. Notting Hill Housing Trust has had, in almost 30 years
of existence, one overriding objective. It is to help those without a home
or who are poorly housed, to find one and then enjoy its benefits. The way
in which we have achieved this objective has changed with different funding
arrangements that have existed over that time. The 1988 Housing Act is
perhaps the most significant change we have had as it required us to raise
private finance to go alongside public funding. We have successfully
responded to this challenge and increased the provision of new homes.
The suggestion that the government should reduce the element of public
funding of a new home and seek to increase the amount of private finance
that we have to raise has substantial implications on wider social policy.
In the areas of inner London where we work the cost rent of a three-bedroom
home would rise from Pounds 67 to Pounds 102 per week. The average income of
our new tenants is currently Pounds 100 per week. Those housed at these
rents are trapped and dependent on benefits. For a government committed to
reducing a dependency culture and seeking to promote employment and growth,
this proposal makes no sense.

<TEXT>
Sir, I was delighted to see your leader on housing policy and as usual it
went straight to the point. It must be extremely tempting for the Treasury
to attempt to reduce the procurement cost of new social housing, and
reduction of the grant from 72 per cent for each new home to 55 per cent
must to the purely mathematically minded seem a good solution. It is vitally
important, however, that in all government spending calculations 'value for
money' is used in a proper sense. If the result of such cuts is an immediate
increase in revenue costs and, most importantly, very predictable extra
expenses in the future, it will have been a false economy.
Housing associations are no longer the Sunday afternoon charitable affairs
that they may once have been, but are staffed by first-rate professionals
answerable to management committees which contain many of us who are used to
operating in the harsh private sector for our working lives. Significant
strides have been made in efficiency and in methods of cost-effective
procurement. All this, however, will be wasted if, as a result of
over-doctrinaire policies, either they have to stop developing at all or
reduce standards and thus incur future costs.

Sir, Your editorial, 'Housing policy' (February 5) was most welcome. The
government's success in expanding housing associations' development capacity
to meet the UK's acute housing needs by combining public grant and private
sector loans has been an important breakthrough. Making the grant go further
is one success story in the dismal 1980s housing record of the Conservative
government. Housing associations now read the Financial Times to make sure
they understand the context in which they arrange private sector lending.
The mission remains the same -  to house those in greatest need -  but the
way it is carried out has changed.
You rightly point out that this success story is in danger of being
destroyed by the potential cuts in the grant rates available to
associations. We shall be caught in the same poverty trap our new tenants
are increasingly in. Higher rents equal more housing benefit dependence for
not just our tenants but also associations themselves. Lenders will not fail
to notice this.
Housing associations have illustrated their ability to respond to the 1988
Housing Act's new pressures on them. All associations, not just the smaller
or specialist ones, must be concerned about their ability to deliver new
rented homes at affordable rents if those cuts grant rates are carried
through.
The House of Commons select committee on the environment's forthcoming
examination of the housing association funding system provides an
opportunity for these issues to be addressed. Let us hope it will.
Sacrificing the affordability, or indeed quality, of the homes we provide to
ensure quantity is not a route which my own association would wish to embark
on.

FT  15 FEB 93 / Letter: Fuel tax better than tolls to ease road congestion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK BARR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Giles Keating's article, 'Absence of road pricing takes its toll'
(Personal View, February 11), sees a number of benefits from road
privatisation, namely reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement
and pollution, and the creation of a new industry in traffic management.
He misses the point. Selective tolls in order to ease congestion are one
thing, but tolls on the entire network are simply a tax on road use, and
inefficient collection does not benefit the economy. Why incur large capital
costs and waste 10 per cent of the revenue on collection (his estimate) when
there are already well-established collection systems in place? A modest
increase on fuel taxes, for example, would achieve the benefits suggested
(apart from his contentious new industry one) with no incremental increase
in collection cost.
Indeed, from an environmental view it takes more from those who use and
damage roads the most (motorways and local), which is surely right.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's article, 'Time for the UK to buck up' (Economic
Viewpoint, February 11) squashes the old chestnut of Britain's poor relative
economic performance against Germany and France. But the real revelation is
the miserable performance of the main European economies put together, as
compared to the US, which shows American output per person averaging twice
that in Europe.
Could there be a more compelling illustration of why Europe must get its act
together, complete the integration process and create the critical economic
mass which, as the American example shows, really works?
