FT  12 FEB 93 / US executives face pay squeeze: White House seeks 'shared
sacrifices' from business leaders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON intends to propose not only increasing taxes on US
corporations but also penalising more extravagant executive salaries.
He told business leaders summoned to the White House yesterday, in
paraphrase of Thomas Jefferson, that Americans were best at 'answering alarm
bells in the night'. It was time, he said, for 'you to do your part'.
The president has frequently spoken of the need for shared sacrifice to cut
the federal budget deficit. He pointed yesterday to 'the enormously
increased rate of executive compensation in the last 12 years', far in
excess of average pay rises.
Without disclosing details, he went on: 'I want to make a proposal that
deals with the fact that the tax code should no longer subsidise excessive
pay for chief executive and other high executives, excessive defined as
unrelated to the productivity of the enterprise.'
In last year's election campaign Mr Clinton spoke disparagingly of executive
salaries of more than Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) a year against a
background of corporate job losses.
Yesterday he said higher taxes on executive incomes would have 'relatively
small dollar impact but great significance to the American working people'.
At a later press briefing, Mr George Stephanopoulos, White House
communications director, confirmed that Mr Clinton is considering reducing
the amount of executive pay that corporations can deduct from their taxes.
Mr Stephanopoulos said the president 'would look to restrict that in some
way, tying it to performance of the company'.
The president specifically linked the tax increases on corporations and
individuals, which he will address in general terms in next Wednesday's
state of the union message and specifically in the budget due on March 23.
'I have also been persuaded by my treasury secretary that it is unwise,
indeed impossible, to raise the individual income tax rate unless there is a
corresponding increase in the corporation tax rate to avoid tax shifting,'
he said.
It has been assumed for some time that Mr Clinton would probably propose
increasing the corporate tax rate from 34 to 36 per cent and the top rate on
the wealthiest individuals (defined as families with an income of more than
Dollars 200,000 a year) from 31 per cent to 36 per cent. Whatever the
president proposes, any final decision on tax rates rests with Congress.
Mr Clinton was careful to repeat another element of his economic plan: that
the corporate tax system should be reformed 'to ensure that it rewards and
encourages those who invest in productivity, in plant, equipment, research
and development, in people who will create jobs and in the markets of
tomorrow'.
The economic stimulus package being worked on by the administration will
almost certainly include bigger investment tax credits - in the Dollars 10bn
to Dollars 15bn range - as well as specific public works programmes.
Mr Clinton also urged his audience not to look to Congress to frustrate his
proposed reforms.
'If the business community leads the way, Congress will follow. I need your
help. I hope you'll be there,' he said.

Those who believe that the government's sudden decision to cut interest
rates last month was a slap in the face for the Bank of England will find
little point in listening to what its next governor has to say about
interest rates. But Mr Eddie George fought back last night - appropriately
enough in Frankfurt, the Mecca of all independent-minded central bankers. By
drawing attention to the Bank's inflation reports, he has served notice that
he does not intend to submit quietly to attempts at monetary subversion. By
saying there is little room for further adjustment, he raised the stakes
some more. For a while, at least, the government will not be able to cut
rates without an open rift with the Bank.

FT  12 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte has chosen a good moment to launch its Pounds 200m debenture. Lack of
supply of long-dated paper allowed it to command a narrow 115 basis point
spread over the equivalent gilt. By moving before pressure of government
borrowing pushes up absolute yields, it has secured 25-year money at little
more than 10 per cent. That looks cheap compared with the cost of equity,
assuming that Forte will start increasing its dividend again at some time
over the next quarter century.
But the issue will still replace debt with debt. It is no substitute for a
rights issue. If yesterday's 2 per cent rise in Forte's shares meant
investors were reassured on this score, they were probably worrying
needlessly in the first place. There are other reasons why Forte is unlikely
to join the queue of companies seeking cash. One is its uncovered dividend.
A rights issue would be difficult to market unless the payout were cut and
rebased, which would in turn require sweeping changes at the top. So it is
just as well for Mr Rocco Forte that the company's balance sheet is less
stretched since the sale of Gardner Merchant.

FT  12 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: BT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT's third-quarter results yesterday revealed that an increasing number of
Britons nattered to each other on the phone for the second successive
quarter. This is good news for the UK economy; it is also encouraging for
BT's shareholders. But investors are not yet going to be swept away with
excitement given the two bigger forces tugging away at BT.
The first is the government's sale of another slab of up to 22 per cent of
BT's shares which may now come in early summer. The government's brokers
will try to tickle up BT's shares in advance. They have a plausible line to
push. BT's prospective dividend yield has now converged with base rates. The
company will generate considerable cash next year creating further scope for
rapid dividend growth. BT's redundancy programme will ensure that operating
costs remain static while revenues pick up strongly in recovery.
But investors may resist such enticements until the uncertainty concerning
BT's much-rumoured talks with the US-based Electronic Data Systems has been
resolved. If BT were to buy a stake, it would make sense to do so soon. The
tumbling pound is increasing the costs of overseas investments. Such a
controversial move may queer the government's pitch. But why should
government funding needs get in the way of strategic decisions by a
privatised company?

FT  12 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: BP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The tide may finally be turning in BP's favour. The company stopped leaking
cash in the fourth quarter thanks to lower capital expenditure and the
reduced dividend. A modest repayment of bank debt was also possible in the
second half, albeit at the expense of shrinking the business through
disposals. Even so, Mr David Simon deserves credit for confounding the
sceptics by raising Pounds 1bn from asset sales last year. With the
nutrition business still up for grabs, this year's debt-reduction target
looks in reach.
The company can expect little help from the cycle. Although the US economy
is reviving, overcapacity in petrochemicals and refining is already causing
pain as Europe slides into recession. Having taken the pain of restructuring
ahead of its rivals, BP may now hold a competitive edge. The market is
inclined to believe this bull case. A yield substantially lower than Shell
is difficult to justify on the basis of yesterday's figures alone.
BP cannot yet make substantial in-roads into its Dollars 15bn borrowings out
of operating cash flow. While US interest rates are low that may not be a
top priority. But if Mr Simon stays on track to reach his goal of Dollars
2bn profits by 1995, the dividend will soon be twice covered. If interest
rates are then on an upward trend, he may be tempted into a rights issue
after all.

FT  12 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Rights and wrongs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House's new management certainly has some gall. Barely a month
after an annual meeting at which last year's accounts were voted through
despite criticism from small shareholders of its auditors, it has discovered
the need for a further Pounds 120m in provisions. It has come to the market
for a Pounds 205m rights issue despite - or perhaps because of - its failure
to dispose of assets at reasonable prices. The earnings outlook remains
depressing. Shareholders tempted to swallow the argument that the rights
shares carry an attractive yield are being bribed with their own money. This
year's dividend will be paid from reserves.
The timing of such an opportunistic strike is explained by Hongkong Land's
unusual option deal which commits it to buy shares at a rights adjusted
price of 79p from a still anonymous counterparty. That both underpins the
share price and means the counterparty is able to underwrite a large portion
of the rights issue at a guaranteed profit.
Without the option deal the issue could scarcely have been underwritten in
the market. But the deal expires in May and the share price will again
become subject to fundamental influences. Investors who do take up their
rights will be pinning their faith in Hongkong Land, which looks set to use
the opportunity to raise its stake to 29.9 per cent. Its extra influence
might help turn the company round but it will be a long struggle. Trafalgar
might have served its shareholders better by persuading Hongkong Land to
mount a full bid in the first place.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Clinton acts to revive Uruguay Round talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton will ask Congress for an extension of the
'fast-track' negotiating authority which is seen as vital to completing the
Uruguay Round trade talks, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative,
announced yesterday.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC external trade commissioner, who met Mr Kantor
yesterday for the first time, said this would give 'immediate life to the
Uruguay Round corpse'. He said any extension should allow enough time to
complete the negotiations but not so much that momentum is lost.
Mr Kantor said the timing, duration and appropriate conditions for the
extension would be determined in meetings with Congress and the private
sector. There has been much speculation in Washington that the round must be
wrapped up with a one to six month extension in order to make way for
another round to deal with issues such as the environment and competition.
The fast-track authority allows a president to submit a trade agreement,
which cannot be amended, for a Yes or No vote in Congress. Under the current
authority, at least an outline of a completed Uruguay Round deal would have
to be sent to Congress by March 2.
Having diplomatically agreed that their first meeting, which lasted two
hours, had been 'useful and productive', both officials urged that Japan
play a more active role in completing the round. The inference was that
Japan must now agree to an opening of its rice market and make further
concessions on cutting or eliminating tariffs.
Both men acknowledged continued differences. Sir Leon said the new steel
tariffs imposed by the Commerce Department were 'altogether unjustified and
excessive', and said he would bring his complaints to the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade.
He said the US threats to levy sanctions on March 22 in a dispute over
government procurement gave the EC leverage to have barriers removed in the
US government procurement market. Bilateral talks on the procurement dispute
are scheduled for next week.
Mr Kantor reiterated his dissatisfaction with the farm reform deal. He
stressed the tough line the administration would take. 'I'm going to enforce
the law,' he said.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs divided over 'quick fix' for
coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CROSS-PARTY consensus over coal on the Commons trade and industry
committee was under great strain yesterday with Tory members accusing Mr
Richard Caborn, its Labour chairman, of seeking to undermine its original
proposals.
The clash came as prospective Tory rebels responded to details of a
government draft white paper by warning it would face Commons defeat if it
pressed ahead with the plan in its current form.
Mr Winston Churchill, the Conservative MP for Davyhulme, said the
government's proposals did not go far enough and would prompt a revolt 'big
enough to defeat the government on the floor of the House.'
He was supported by Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, the Tory MP for Batley &amp; Spen,
who said the plan, which envisages expanding the market for domestic
deep-mined coal by some 12m tonnes a year on average for five years, 'looks
like a quick fix.'
The principal attack on Mr Caborn came from Mr Keith Hampson, a Conservative
committee member, who said it looked 'suspiciously like the figures are
being reworked in order to enable the Labour party to use the report to
justify their campaign to save all the pits.'
It seemed 'very strange' for the chairman of the committee to hold a press
conference and bring along an expert to rubbish the committee's findings, Mr
Hampson added. He said the matter would be raised at the cross-party body's
next meeting.
The select committee report, published last month, advocated creating an
additional market of at least 16m tonnes per year for domestic deep-mined
coal by a range of measures including postponing electricity market
liberalisation. This implied saving about half of the 31 threatened pits.
Mr John Butterfill, another Conservative committee-member, said yesterday he
disagreed with Mr Caborn's assertion that the recommendations were a package
to take or leave. Mr Caborn's statement had not been discussed with or
approved by the committee, he added.
Mr Caborn joined the attack on the government's plans, saying they would 'do
no more than provide a breathing space for a limited number of pits.'
Although room might be made for more than 12m tonnes additional consumption
in the first year, the government's package has been widely interpreted as
implying the rescue of only a dozen or so pits - based on the traditional
scale equating 1m tonnes of coal to one pit and 1,000 jobs.
But British Coal said yesterday that productivity improvements over the last
year had raised the average pit's output to about 1.5m tonnes per year. This
rendered the old rule of thumb invalid.
The government's draft calls for the market for deep-mined coal to be
expanded by adopting a four-pronged approach: blocking imports of
orimulsion, a bitumen-based fuel; slowing the planned rundown of coal
stocks; cutting output from open-cast mines; and using subsidies to halt
growth in coal imports.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Personal View: Temptation that must be resisted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN WALTERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine that, in September 1992, sterling had been realigned within the
exchange rate mechanism instead of floating out. Suppose that it had been
pegged at about its present level of DM2.37 with either 6 per cent or even
2.25 per cent bands. Then one might conclude that there would have been
little difference between the 2.37 peg and today's 2.37 float.
But this is not correct. If Britain were in the ERM, and the peg were
credible, interest rates would have to exceed the 8.5 per cent of Germany -
say, around 9 or 10 per cent or even higher if the market suspected further
devaluation, compared with 6 per cent today. As for the French franc, the
Dutch guilder and other ERM currencies, their interest rates remain
dominated by Germany - as indeed was the UK's before last September. Britain
would simply rejoin the club.
Interest rates of more than 9 per cent would prolong and deepen Britain's
recession. The growth of all measures of the money supply would suffer a
relapse. Indeed, it is likely that the money supply would actually fall.
There would then be a serious risk of a widespread financial collapse. While
it is painful but possible to work out the large overhang of debt in
corporate balance sheets and household portfolios with interest rates below
6 per cent or so, rates above 10 per cent pose monumental problems. A
domino-like collapse cannot be ruled out.
I suspect that the government knows and appreciates the disaster that would
follow re-entry today. Indeed, the prime minister, Mr John Major, has ruled
out early re-entry. But suppose that the hopes of the market are realised
and that German interest rates are substantially reduced in the months
ahead. Then would Mr Major be tempted in?
It all depends. But it is clear that, if and as the Maastricht bus rolls on,
Mr Major will be under considerable pressure to rejoin the ERM. The
negotiations for monetary union and the European (Monetary Institute)
Central Bank will commence shortly after the ratification of Maastricht.
Since the ERM is the only road to convergence and monetary union, it follows
that the really serious negotiations can take place only among those who are
in the core of the ERM and, perhaps, are within striking distance of
achieving the conditions of monetary and fiscal 'convergence' required for
acceptance into the union.
Ardent European that he is, Mr Major, egged on as always by those inveterate
'joiners' in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, will have a great
incentive to participate in the ERM and be admitted to this exclusive club.
Of course, no great harm will be done to Britain if German interest rates
fall to, say, 4 per cent at the end of 1993 and stay there. Then what has
long been a persistent and large deviation between the interest rates
required by the ERM and those needed for Britain's domestic economy will at
last be small beer. But is it plausible? Will such harmony persist? More to
the point, should Mr Major mortgage Britain's future on such a conjecture?
In my judgment, Bundesbank interest rates are unlikely to fall to these
levels in the course of 1993. The persistence of inflationary pressures in
Germany will keep rates high and they are unlikely to be less than 6 per
cent by December 1993. The question then arises: will Mr Major be so
pressurised by the need to be at the top ERM table that he will nevertheless
risk aborting Britain's recovery?
One hopes not, but it would be foolish to believe that political priorities
will not prevail. The best one could hope is that, by cutting interest
rates, Mr Major will drive sterling down to such a level - say,
DM2.00-DM2.20 - that, on entry to the ERM at that prevailing rate of
exchange, the depressing imposition of high German interest rates will be
largely offset by the boost to the economy of such a low exchange rate.
I would not, however, suggest that this is a likely stance for the
government. The French and others would complain bitterly about 'competitive
devaluation' and the FCO, as well as the Treasury, would soon call a
retreat.
I conclude that, to secure his seat at the top Emu table, Mr Major is likely
to attempt re-entry into the ERM during the next year. One hopes for a less
disastrous run than that which we endured in 1987-92, but it would be
foolish to expect it.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Trading east
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST annual economic review of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development provides a chilling perspective for western Europe's pessimists.
While economic conditions are difficult in the European Community, they are
many times harsher for its eastern neighbours. While strained economic
relations are making trading conditions difficult for members of the
European exchange rate mechanism, the almost complete breakdown of monetary
relations to the east has meant an accelerating collapse in trade and output
in the republics of the former Soviet Union.
All is not completely bleak. The first casualties of the demise of the
former Soviet Union were the countries of eastern Europe. Heavily dependent
on Soviet trade, they were devastated by the shift to hard currency
settlement of trade with the then Soviet Union in January 1991 and the 63
per cent fall in Soviet imports that followed. But Poland, after three years
of falling output, is on the verge of economic growth while the Czech
Republic and Hungary have also shifted successfully to current account
convertibility, and re-oriented their economies towards western markets.
Sadly, the main obstacle to export-led growth in eastern Europe is now
western Europe's unwillingness to accept free trade. But even if the EC, in
a fit of uncharacteristic enlightenment, were to open its markets to eastern
products, the plight of the republics of the former Soviet Union would
remain dire. Heavily dependent on each other for the large majority of trade
in oil, raw materials and industrial components, they have little chance of
surviving independently.
Rebuilding close economic and trade ties between the republics is a
pre-condition for the success of economic reform. But the EBRD is right to
argue that the western pressure to hold the rouble zone together was
misguided. The inflationary and fiscal tensions produced by the effort to
maintain it are largely responsible for the deterioration in monetary
relations between the republics, the reversion to bilateral trade agreements
and crude barter arrangements, and the collapse in trade and output.
The former Soviet republics should, instead, be building a multilateral
clearing system, with western support, in order to finance trade and allow
Russia to raise oil prices to world levels, without provoking balance of
payments crises. A common currency is not needed for a revival in
inter-republican trade. At present, it is having the opposite effect.

Now that the Queen has finally agreed to put her tax affairs in order,
perhaps the Inland Revenue should sort out its relationship with Rouge
Dragon Pursuivant, Arundel Herald Extraordinary, Clarenceux King of Arms and

Back in 1549, King Edward V1 let them off paying tax and although they do
now give the tax collector a 'free gift', equivalent to their tax payments,
it is not very tidy. What happens, for example, if there is a dispute?

Having helped Bill Clinton to beat George Bush, Stan Greenberg wants to do
the same for Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress. The new US
president's campaign adviser has offered to work for the ANC ahead of South
Africa's first multiracial elections, expected next year.
Greenberg has a particular interest in the country; he was a visiting
lecturer at Witwatersrand University, Johannesburg, for a year in the 1970s.
But ANC leaders, who've yet to decide on his offer, may still think his
experience falls short of the task. After all, if the ANC is to win, it
needs to crack problems far tougher than were Clinton's.
The first is getting people to register as voters; millions are illiterate
with no experience of elections and little of democracy at all. A second is
teaching them how to vote under the complicated proportional representation
system. The knottiest is preventing violence from harming the party's
chances.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Observer: Bulb push
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Don't panic if you find your children staring fixedly at the ceiling. Likely
as not they are carrying out a national light bulb audit on behalf of the
government's energy efficiency office.
It's all part of a campaign, given a big push by BBC's Blue Peter TV
programme yesterday, to save the planet from global warming by persuading
the population to install energy-saving compact fluorescent lights (CFLs).
The new bulbs' attraction is that they use only a third of the energy of the
conventional product and last eight times as long. The snag is they cost 20
times as much.
Hence Britain's Lighting Industry Federation has scored an enviable
marketing coup by persuading the BBC to boost its new product. It even
managed to get the prime minister and opposition leader to agree about
something on camera - that the bulb is a good idea.

Things must be coming to a pretty pass when stockbrokers dismiss
stockbrokers. That is nevertheless what BWD Rensburg, the ambitious and
quoted northern broking and financial services group, did yesterday in
giving Credit Lyonnais Laing the push in favour of James Capel.
Laing said that on the whole BWD looked after itself and the relationship
was 'never close'. But a better clue to the distantness thereof was given by
BWD chief executive Christopher Broadbent when he let slip that the sacking
was prompted by 'personnel changes' at Laing.
Apparently he didn't hear of them until a year after they'd been made.

When it comes to shareholders' ballots, Trafalgar House chief executive
Allan Gormly acknowledges being akin to a trade union baron in the matter of

True, small shareholders may vote against the official line, as Trafalgar's
did over the reappointment of Touche Ross as its auditors. But the massive
votes of the institutions can be relied on to toe the line.
While Gormly admits the position is less than ideally democratic, that may
nevertheless be as well - especially with shareholders being asked to
approve yet another rights issue.

Few resorts have seen tourism collapse so much in the last few years as has
Rio de Janeiro. Petty crime is now so common there that the US Traveller's
Advisory Service warns visitors not to walk in the streets at any time.
The city's new administration is hard at work with hotel-owners on a
remedial campaign. Its main emphasis is on repolishing the image of the
Cidade Maravilhosa (marvellous city), largely by claiming the situation to
be exaggerated by foreigners.
Hence the authorities' horror on hearing of the display to be mounted on one
of the giant floats in next week's Carnival parade, the city's main annual
attraction. The theme, presented with great verve by the Caprichosos de
Pilares samba school, is hapless tourists being not only robbed and
assaulted by street children, but molested by transvestites.
Out went a formal protest from a furious secretary of tourism to the League
of Samba Schools, fulminating about 'profoundly bad taste', and trying to
ban the offending display. But, brandishing the right to free expression,
the particular school concerned is having none of it, and a legal battle is
under way.
Oddly enough, last year there was a float depicting England, which consisted
of a double-decker bus being smashed up by football hooligans and the like.
It raised no protest at all.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Leading Article: How to raise UK taxation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NO BRITISH government has the credibility to pile up liabilities at the rate
of some 10 per cent of gross domestic product for very long. This is the
main reason why the chancellor has to act on the structural fiscal deficit
both decisively and soon. The question facing him can only be how best to
start closing the gap.
The amount by which the structural budget needs to be improved over the next
few years is some Pounds 15bn-Pounds 20bn (2 1/2 -3 per cent of GDP). Not
entirely coincidentally, Pounds 20bn is also roughly the amount by which the
government's new 'control total' - the non-cyclical element in public
spending - was allowed to rise, in 1991-92 prices, between 1990-91 and
1993-94. Almost all of the adjustment will have to come from taxation rather
than lower public spending. The review of public spending announced by Mr
Michael Portillo this week may well prove important, but only in the longer
term.
Ideally, the chancellor would announce a substantial proportion of the
Pounds 20bn adjustment in March, but postpone implementation to January,
after the second Budget of the year, or 1994-95. An adjustment of Pounds
12bn (2 per cent of GDP) would be a useful start.
How might such sums be raised? The main instruments would have to be income
tax, value added tax and national insurance, which now account for 26, 17
and 17 per cent of total revenue, respectively.
Increasing the basic rate of income tax to 30p would raise Pounds 8.3bn in a
full year. Increasing higher rate to 50p would raise Pounds 3.3bn. Either
would also create hysteria on Mr Lamont's backbenches. This is a pity, since
nothing could better demonstrate the absurdity of wanting both higher public
spending and lower taxation. Eliminating mortgage interest relief on housing
 -for which there might never, given current low interest rates, be a better
opportunity - could raise Pounds 4bn-Pounds 4 1/2 bn.
There are more covert, though longer-term, ways of raising revenue from
income tax: one, notes the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is non-indexation
of the basic rate limit, which would push more taxpayers into the 40p band.
This could raise an additional Pounds 1.7bn in 1992-93 prices by 1996-97.
Also progressive would be restricting all allowances to the basic rate,
which would raise Pounds 1.3bn in one year. A more regressive move would be
to freeze all allowances, which would raise Pounds 1bn.
The IFS says that Pounds 10.7bn could be raised by imposing standard-rate
VAT of 17.5 per cent on expenditures that are now zero-rated. A uniform VAT
would be economically more efficient than the present diversity.
Announcement of future increases in VAT would bring spending forward as
well, though this effect would be modest, since most zero-rated items are
perishable. But increasing VAT on this scale would raise prices by 3.7 per
cent. It would be politically explosive as well and require compensation for
those on low incomes.
National insurance contributions are little more than a regressive income
tax. If Mr Portillo's review does, as it should, obliterate the contributory
principle, it might become possible to merge national insurance into income
tax. In the meantime, substantial sums - up to Pounds 2 1/2 bn - could be
raised by eliminating the present anomalous upper earnings limit on national
insurance contributions.
This is, unfortunately, no time for fine-tuning the fiscal system. It is
not, given the amount of money that must be raised, even one for imaginative
fiscal reform. It is a time for plucking the geese as efficiently as
possible. The government will have to announce its intention to raise large
sums by a mixture of higher taxes on spending and higher taxes on income. It
will not be much fun. But it has to be done.
This is the third in a series of leaders on the March Budget

FT  12 FEB 93 / Leading Article: GM's signal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR ONCE Corporate America can feel grateful to the Financial Accounting
Standards Board. By requiring companies to account more prudently for
healthcare costs, it has obliged them to send a powerful signal to
Washington just when Democratic politicians are itching to have companies
provide new mandated social service benefits. No doubt General Motors had
good financial reasons for writing off Dollars 21bn at a stroke, instead of
spreading the cost over 20 years, as the FASB also permits. But the
announcement of such a huge write-off, coming alongside similar, if smaller,
write-offs at Ford and other big corporations, is a timely reminder that
healthcare insurance imposes a substantial employment tax on US companies.
Healthcare costs in the US are about 50 per cent higher than the
international norm at 12 per cent of GDP. The system relies heavily on
employers to provide health insurance. The result of this explosive
combination can be seen in the transformation of the motor industry's cost
structure: Ford now spends as much on medical care as on steel for its
vehicles. The financial burden falls heavily on mature industries, since
they have a larger population of retired workers to support. Meanwhile many
employees of small businesses, which cannot afford large bills for
healthcare, go uncovered.
Against that background it is hardly surprising that big American industry
has become an impressive exporter of American jobs. In an increasingly
global labour market, excessive healthcare costs are a competitive
disadvantage. And small business, the chief engine of job-creation in the US
over the past decade, worries about the potential cost of any future move to
compel all companies to provide healthcare insurance. A radical break in the
link between healthcare and employment is thus a challenging priority for
the Clinton administration.
The problem for big US companies is not unique. High social costs in the
German motor industry are causing jobs to disappear eastwards. Even in
Japan, where on Tuesday the government formally asked industry not to shed
labour, the lifetime employment system is imposing a pressing cost burden in
the worst recession since the first oil shock. But Toyota this week was
reporting declining profits, unlike GM, which was cheered at the prospect of
reducing its losses. Ultimately, the quality of the cars is vastly more
important than the relative burden of social costs.

FT  12 FEB 93 / A disarming achievement: The next big challenge for arms
control is to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time in 20 years, diplomats in Geneva and Vienna have no new
arms control treaty on their agenda.
Delegates stay on, working to tidy up existing pacts and put them into
practice, carrying on discussions on a set of disarmament topics - but no
longer with any mandate to negotiate treaties.
That phase is over. There has never been a period for arms control such as
the one accompanying the end of the cold war. The old east-west adversaries
are now concentrating on the challenge of carrying it all out and trying to
mend the holes in the arms control web which could lead to new threats,
including the threat of nuclear missiles, from developing countries.
Last month's convention outlawing chemical weapons - an ambition of the
international community since the end of the last century - was the last of
an extraordinary series. In just over five years, three treaties between the
nuclear superpowers and four wide-ranging international agreements have been
concluded. Five of these pacts involve actually destroying weapons and
monitoring their destruction.
The first to break this new ground, the US-Soviet Intermediate Nuclear
Forces treaty, obliged both countries to destroy all their medium-range
ground-to-ground missiles. Within a month of finishing the job in 1991, they
signed the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start), the culmination of
a long, interrupted negotiating process. In January this year, with that
treaty not yet in force, they overtook it with the more radical Start 2,
aiming at a two-thirds reduction in their long-range nuclear arsenals.
Wrecking of more mundane weapons, such as tanks, began last year under the
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, which Nato and the Warsaw
Pact completed in 1990. Verification clauses allow these countries and
successor states to pry into one another's military affairs on a scale
beyond the dreams of any cold-war spy. The Open Skies treaty signed last
year means they can also carry out surveillance flights over each other's
territory. These accords were followed by agreement on the missing element
in the CFE deal, manpower ceilings, a subject that arms control negotiators
had often despaired of resolving.
All these negotiations began when the main concern was lowering east-west
tensions. Political upheavals in eastern Europe assisted the process, but
also robbed the agreements of much of their impact. The ceilings set in CFE
are now largely artificial. For their own budgetary reasons most
participants on both sides are making deeper cuts.
No new categories of weapons have been identified for extending the process.
The idea of bringing general-purpose naval forces into the arms control net
has always been resisted by Nato - on the grounds that the western alliance
relies ultimately on Atlantic sea-lanes - and Moscow appears to have stopped
pressing its case.
Since it is no longer possible to talk of an east-west balance, the
framework which served for drawing up the CFE treaty is no longer available.
There was much talk of a CFE 2, but the process stopped at the manpower
agreement known in the jargon as CFE 1a. The CFE treaty was the first
between the members of Nato and the Warsaw Pact; CFE 1a was the last.
Reluctance to move further along the path of negotiated disarmament is also
partly a reflection of the amount of work needed to implement existing
agreements and the serious question of how countries such as Russia and
Ukraine can cope. Surplus armoured vehicles, artillery weapons and aircraft
covered by the terms of CFE have to be destroyed in the next three years.
Nuclear cuts are spread over 10 years. The US is anxious to speed them up
but Russia cannot do it without help.
Many arms control experts favour further nuclear cuts. But US officials have
indicated that any follow-on would be some years off.
At the height of the Start talks, chief negotiators were meeting every day,
alternately at the US and Soviet missions in Geneva. Later they flew in on
intermittent visits. Now the US delegation discussing nuclear and space
issues no longer has an ambassador.
Under the umbrella of the 39-nation UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva,
which produced the hard-won chemical pact, committees continue to discuss
subjects such as radiological weapons, of which none are known to exist, and
a permanent ban on nuclear tests, for which the US, Britain and France are
not yet ready. One panel is charged with a 'comprehensive programme of
disarmament', but that committee is dormant.
In Vienna, consultative groups work on implementation of the CFE and Open
Skies accords. In the same room in the Hofburg palace where negotiators
spent 15 years up to 1989 failing to agree on mutual force reductions in
central Europe, the 53 countries now belonging to the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe attend a Forum on Security Co-operation, devoted
to confidence-building measures.
But the priority for western governments has shifted. The main focus now is
on stemming the proliferation of nuclear and other weapons - a worry that
has risen with the disintegration of the Soviet Union which, it is feared,
could either spawn new nuclear powers or enable other countries to obtain
weapons, materials or the know-how to produce them.
The Chemical Weapons Convention, due to come into force in 1995, will
complete a series of treaties which already cover nuclear and biological
weapons programmes. But some countries fall outside these agreements; most
Arab governments said they would not sign the chemical convention as long as
Israel got away with holding nuclear weapons. There is also concern about
the scope for cheating within treaties, as Iraq, a signatory of the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, did on a grandiose scale before the Gulf war.
The crucial event looming is the NPT review in 1995, when the treaty's
25-year span runs out. The review conference has to decide whether to renew
it, for how long, and whether to amend it. A preparatory committee starting
work in Geneva will focus on ways of tightening inspections to prevent
illegal programmes such as Iraq's.
Efforts are also under way to find acceptable ways of monitoring the 1972
Biological Weapons Convention. British arms control officials hope that
'managed access' procedures worked out for the chemical convention can serve
as a model for the other two treaties.
Measures to curb proliferation of missiles were recently extended to cover
weapons capable of carrying chemical as well as nuclear warheads. Since an
informal Missile Technology Control Regime was set up in 1987, the number of
industrial nations participating has grown from seven to 22, and several
others, including Russia, have promised to follow its guidelines.
However, none of these regimes is watertight. The best that is hoped for is
to slow down programmes by would-be proliferators and make them more
expensive and more embarrassing.
Plans for sharing information about arms sales are seen as helping this
process. 'Transparency in armaments' has become a new buzzword. The first
returns are due to be made this spring for a UN sales register, initially
proposed by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. But British officials make
clear that curbing sales is not part of the aim.
After the 1991 Gulf war, talks were begun between the US, Britain, France,
Russia and China on controlling supplies to the Middle East, or at least
keeping a watch on them. But China pulled out after the US announced plans
last September to sell F-16 fighters to Taiwan. It is unclear where, if
anywhere, the talks will lead. Meanwhile the contracts flow in - ranging
from the delivery of a Russian submarine to Iran to the recent Pounds
4bn-Pounds 5bn UK-Saudi deal including Tornado bombers.
Defence cuts at home mean that suppliers - and for that matter government
armament programmes - rely increasingly on exports, and there is no sign
that either western or former Warsaw Pact countries are prepared to deprive
their arms manufacturers of this part of their livelihood.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, After three years of heavy losses and three agonising weeks for Daf
employees, the management called in the receivers and asked for protection
against its creditors.
It took the receivers two days to arrive at the conclusion that Daf as a
truck maker has a viable future, but only under the form of a new, leaner
company, concentrating on its core business - the design, development and
production of trucks.
The Dutch minister of economics was so impressed by the receiver's findings
that he not only agreed, but promised to support the new venture
financially. So why during three years of declining sales and losses did
Daf's own management fail to come up with a plan for restructuring, similar
to the one which the receiver managed to put together in two days?
The answer is simple. Daf management would never have been able to reach a
similar consensus, either with the unions or the government, without the
real threat of imminent bankruptcy hanging over its head.

Sir, Throwing good money after bad by supporting lame ducks looks like a bad
policy. Or as your leader, 'Dutch courage' (February 8), states, supporting
'commercial misjudgments on the scale of those at Philips plainly takes a
broad view of economic utility'. Somewhat surprisingly the Dutch industry
has fared better than that of the UK, starting from a much weaker base.
Could that be because other factors compensate for the lame duck support
policy? Or perhaps the UK government saves money by not supporting lame
ducks but unfortunately does not spend the savings on strong ducks. Of
course, it is hard to predict what will be a permanent lame duck. Almost
every enterprise at some point appeared a lame duck. When employment is in
decline, a broad view of economic utility may be highly effective.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Trials and tribulations: Sir James McKinnon claims his style
of regulation is necessary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, the UK gas industry
regulator, says his relationship with British Gas is dominated by 'creative
tension'. Most in the company would recognise the tension, and are unlikely
to regret Sir James's decision to step down from his post in September, a
year earlier than scheduled. But how creative has the UK's most combative
regulator been during his six-year tenure?
The aggressive style of the 63-year-old lorry driver's son from Glasgow has
left the industry and investors on the one hand, and consumers on the other,
divided over this question.
Consumers have benefited from Sir James's tenure. His constant attacks on
the cost of gas have helped bring a 20 per cent reduction in gas prices in
real terms in the six years since privatisation. He has pushed British Gas
to publish standards of service and commit itself to paying compensation if
it fails to meet them. Ofgas has encouraged British Gas to deal more
sympathetically with customers who cannot pay their bills. Partly as a
result, the number of disconnections dropped from 60,000 in 1986 to 16,000
last year.
But Sir James's approach to his role has brought him into conflict with
British Gas, which says he has damaged its business. Investors, too, are
wary of Sir James's motives: 'The City tends to see him as a demon with two
horns and a pitchfork,' said one shareholder.
Sir James's pricing formula limits price rises to 5 percentage points below
the rate of inflation, compared with a limit of 2 percentage points below
inflation set by the government at the time of privatisation. The effect of
the new formula will be apparent in two weeks, when British Gas announces
its results for last year - the first year in which the new, tougher pricing
formula was in place.
Gas industry observers say that the new pricing system will play a big part
in reducing profits to between Pounds 850m and Pounds 900m, compared with
Pounds 1.16bn in 1991. Analysts have already cut their estimates of dividend
growth at the company to little above the expected rate of inflation from
this year to 1997 - when the pricing formula is to be reviewed again.
Sir James argues that the fall in profits is more a result of the effects of
recession on demand and last year's relatively warm weather than of his
pricing regime.
He believes that profit levels could be maintained, even under the new
system, if British Gas improves its efficiency through cutting jobs and
rais-ing produc-tivity.
Investors are also concerned that Sir James's tough regulation of the
company in the UK has forced it to expand overseas. As its UK profit base
comes under pressure from regulators and increasing competition, British Gas
is looking to diversify into oil and gas exploration abroad and in
international gas distribution.
The worry is that this profit flow is riskier than the company's core UK
business. 'Investors are somewhat concerned about diversification into
Global Gas (British Gas's overseas gas distribution arm),' said Mr Nick
Antill, analyst at Hoare Govett, the UK stockbrokers.
But Sir James is not the only regulator to erode the company's core UK
business. It is the Office of Fair Trading, for example, that is forcing
British Gas to surrender 60 per cent of its industrial market to rival
suppliers by 1995. This market, which involves the supply of gas to
businesses, is one of the company's biggest revenue sources.
Sir James's influence on the industrial sector of British Gas's business is
restricted by law. This is because the government expected the deregulation
of the gas market after privatisation would itself encourage competition in
the industry.
But when competition failed to develop - partly because of a shortage of gas
supplies available to British Gas's rivals - it was left to Sir James to
prompt the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the Office of Fair Trading
to seek ways of promoting competition. This resulted in both regulators
imposing various measures on British Gas since privatisation, and leav-ing
Sir James to decide whether they had been effective.
It is a system with which Sir James himself is not happy. He recently
denounced the OFT's demand that British Gas give up most of its industrial
market as 'impossible'.
It is one of the few views he shares with British Gas. 'The problem is that
there is no cohesion between regulators and, with them acting independently,
they could totally screw up the whole financial future of the company,' said
Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive.
The two main demands made on the company - the reduction of prices and the
surrender of a large part of the industrial market - were one of the
principal reasons behind British Gas's decision to request a review of its
business by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission last August.
The review, which is due to be published in July, should give British Gas
some clear indications of its future course. Mr Brown is hoping it could
prompt a radical rethink in the way the gas industry is regulated.
Even from within the consumer lobby, there is now some desire for change. Mr
Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers' Council, believes the ground has
shifted and that, while Sir James's combative approach has reaped
'tremendous benefits', there should now be room for a more constructive
dialogue between British Gas and Ofgas. 'British Gas does understand the
significance of regulation now and it is possible for Ofgas to work more
closely with the company.'
Sir James maintains that his style of regulation is necessary to control
British Gas, and that a difficult relationship is to be expected between a
regulator and a monopolist. But even he may welcome a respite. When
announcing his decision to step down, he said: 'It is a bit like banging
your head against the wall; it's nice when you stop.'

FT  12 FEB 93 / Letter: US punitive damages legally complex, but fair in
concept
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T G NELSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The US system of punitive damages is a complex legal maze and is
further convoluted by differences which exist throughout the 50 states.
However, the fundamental concept is simple and fair.
The system provides a straightforward procedure wherein an inanimate, but
irresponsible, corporation's behaviour can be addressed by punishing it to a
degree commensurate with its irresponsibility and proportional to the
sufferings produced. Hopefully, such punishment will discourage the
reoccurrence of such behaviour.
In addition to the points Robert Rice made in his article, 'The high cost of
damaged goods' (February 9), he should also point out other important issues
of US product safety and liability law. First, warranty and strict liability
are quite distinct from negligence in that corporate behaviour becomes the
key question of negligence. Second, throughout the US, punitive damages are
on average four to eight times compensatory damages and there are in fact
very few large punitive damage settlements and very few where this ratio
becomes skewed. Also, punitive damages are not insurable.
Third, many unreasonable punitive damage awards by juries have been
immediately reduced by presiding judges or later on appeal.
Perhaps most important is the cultural differences reflected in our laws.
One example is the concept of foreseeable (although unintended) use of a
product. If you manufacture screwdrivers you should ensure their safe use
and function as pry bars. If you don't, you can be held liable for injury
for such a foreseeable use.
However, with equal importance to the issues of product liability,
negligence, and other legal nuances, European managers contemplating or now
doing business in the US should also be aware that many new laws have been
enacted specifically to address corporate and managerial behaviour
concerning the environment and employee safety. Specific penalties for
endangering and injuring employees have resulted in incarceration and
substantial fines to corporate managers and officers.
Yes, it is a dangerous world out there.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Letter: Fallacy of conditions for Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN SHIPMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Frequent reference is made to 'Maastricht treaty limits' of 3 per cent
of gross domestic product for budget deficits, and 60 per cent of GDP for
public debt - which, together with conditions for inflation and
interest-rate convergence and exchange-rate stability, are supposed to
precede any early move to European monetary union.
Although agreed at Maastricht in 1991, these conditions are not written into
the treaty. Article 104c refers to 'reference values' for government
deficits and debts. The protocol on convergence criteria sets relative
target ranges for inflation and long-term interest rates, but leaves it up
to the council to define 'excessive deficits'. This definition need not be
finalised until January 1 1994.
With all but two ERM countries currently breaching the limits, some for good
reasons, an opportunity remains to revise them upwards. The treaty is being
accused of enshrining rigidities it does not contain.

   From Mr OVUL TEZISLER

<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Cyprus choice' (February 4) contains in itself a train
of thought which is not conducive to a political settlement on the island.
The aim should be to help both sides to come to terms with each other's
vital concerns and this should be achieved through freely conducted
face-to-face negotiations. The ensuring settlement must be acceptable to
both sides.
The settlement should not aim, as is suggested by your leader, at cornering
one side or the other.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Letter: No shortage of government support for projects in
Leeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Baroness DENTON OF WAKEFIELD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As minister with special responsibility for Leeds and Bradford, I was
very pleased to see your special feature on Leeds on January 28. However,
Stewart Dalby's article leaves the impression that the city is not getting
support from central government.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Recently, Tony Baldry, housing
minister, announced government support for one of the largest ever housing
estate action packages - worth Pounds 63m. The housing improvement plan will
link in with training and crime prevention measures.
The government is also channelling resources to housing associations in the
city at an annual rate of some Pounds 20m as well as providing the council
with spending allocations of some Pounds 25m on its own stock.
As your other articles make clear, the government has so far invested some
Pounds 39m in the Leeds Development Corporation, which has levered in three
times that amount in private sector support and has generated thousands of
jobs. The government has also pledged Pounds 20m to help develop the new
museum for the Royal Armouries in Leeds.
Following the Autumn Statement, we announced a Pounds 22m package of road
and transport measures, on top of resources for the Leeds/Bradford rail
electrification.
A major boost has been given to Leeds hospitals with the Department of
Health approving expenditure of Pounds 11m at Chapel Allerton and Pounds 70m
for phase 1 of the redevelopment of the Leeds General Infirmary.
The list goes on, but there are limits on your space. It all amounts to very
substantial help from the government. Baroness Denton,

FT  12 FEB 93 / The way out for Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If all else fails, trim your sails. Mr John Major's cabinet is guided by the
thought expressed in that little couplet. It is what gets the prime minister
through the night. But how to trim? It is easy to commandeer taxpayers'
money to pay for wasteful but politically popular hospitals, coal mines or
army regiments. It is not so easy when what is at stake is a matter of
principle, as with the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Yet as I shall
suggest in a moment, there is always something.
Consider. Parliament has been told that it must accept or reject the
totality of what was agreed by the 12 European Community governments in
December 1991. That includes the bit regarded by the prime minister as his
personal triumph - the protocol on social policy. According to that
celebrated excuse-note, 11 of the member states - but not Britain  - are
anxious to adopt the no doubt admirable but costly employment practices laid
down in the 1989 'social charter', which gives various rights to employees
and imposes numerous obligations on employers. An agreement on this social
policy, applicable only to the 11 countries that want to implement it, is
appended.
Labour says that it wants the terms of that agreement to apply in Britain,
so it has put down an amendment that would write the protocol out. The
Liberal Democrats concur. Both parties appear to imagine that what will
follow if Labour's amendment is carried will be a brief recall of the 12 EC
governments, upon which Mr Major will shrug his shoulders, say 'that is what
parliament wants' and sign a new treaty that commits Britain to a
Continental-style social policy. There is a certain inconsistency here.
Under Mr John Smith's guidance Labour is distancing itself from the more
expensive forms of social democracy practised in northern Europe. Labour's
leader may one day find the social charter a shade too far to the left for
the image that he is trying to project.
The Conservative Euro-sceptics have a different problem. They see the social
charter as a characteristic manifestation of the kind of socialism that
would be imposed on Britain by a European super-state. Yet they are
suggesting that they will vote for the Labour amendment, on the ground that
there is no danger of the prime minister renegotiating the treaty to include
the social policy. Some believe the consequence would be that the whole
enterprise would be scuppered. This interpretation has been endorsed by Mr
Douglas Hurd, who has intimated that if the ratification bill is not passed
in its original form, social opt-out included, the treaty will be dead.
All of these players are bluffing. Labour and the Liberal Democrats will
have trouble keeping their most enthusiastic pro-Europeans in line if it
looks as if a vote for the social policy amendment will kill the bill. Mr
Smith himself does not want to become known as the man who sank the treaty.
The Tory Euro-sceptics in the Commons are ducking and weaving in order to
keep their opponents - their fellow Conservatives on the government benches
 -guessing. Mr Hurd cannot seriously contemplate walking away from the
Maastricht treaty.
In short you could say that what we have seen this week has been nothing
more than a round of parliamentary games. When the vote on Labour's
amendment comes, next month or in April, the number of Conservative rebels
will be kept below the 11 needed to defeat the government if all opposition
MPs turn up and vote the same way. Alternatively, there may be more rebels
but the opposition ranks will not hold firm. There is nothing to worry
about.
This is probably true, but nobody can be sure. A good trimmer always has a
contingency plan, as Mr Major demonstrated on November 4. That was the night
on which he survived by three votes, bought by a promise to put off the
third reading of the Maastricht bill until after the Danish referendum.
Better a postponed ratification than no treaty, the foreign secretary
explained afterwards, blushing slightly. What Mr Hurd meant was, better a
positive vote than no European strategy, no economic strategy, no prime
minister and no Conservative government.
The same equation will apply if there is a similarly close final vote on the
social charter amendment. The prime minister cannot afford to lose. If he
did suffer such a calamity he would become Mr John Nothing. His talk of
placing Britain at the heart of Europe would sound empty. He would be adrift
on the economy, adrift on sterling, adrift on Europe, adrift before the
electorate.
It is here that my suggestion comes in. The Euro-sceptics would trade their
loyalty for a referendum. It is true that Mr Major cannot decently give them
the kind of immediate popular veto over ratification that they are asking
for. To do so he would have to eat more words than he has been accustomed to
consuming at a single sitting. He might choke. So no referendum now.
A referendum later, much later, might be easier to swallow. Mr Major could
say that the contents of the treaty are too complicated to be expressed as a
single question, and that anyhow no serious constitutional issue arises from
accepting the treaty as it stands. He would be right. The political
arrangements settled at Maastricht do not constitute a step towards a
European super-state.
The move to economic union is, however, another matter. If Britain does
exchange sterling for a single European currency, managed by a single
central bank, it will have handed important responsibilities to an outside
authority. Maastricht allows Britain to opt in or out of such an
arrangement. There is a case for a referendum on that. The vote need not
come much before 1996 at the earliest and, the sceptical side of Mr Major
may tell himself, it may not happen at all, at least not in the present
century. The prime minister would have to say that he could not bind future
parliaments, but that his government would recommend a popular vote if the
question was whether Britain should enter a single-currency union.
If the proposition was put to him this morning, he would reject it. His
natural hope must be that there will never again be as close a vote on a
European matter as there was on November 4. But suppose there is, and
suppose that the clock stands at a few minutes to midnight?

FT  12 FEB 93 / Arts: Antwerp at its apogee - Patricia Morison finds many
Flemish masterpieces but little information
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An extraordinarily prolific outpouring of artistic talent is the theme of
From Bruegel to Rubens: The Antwerp School of Painting from 1550 to 1650, at
the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. Inevitably, we think of those
generations in terms of the great foursome, Bruegel, Rubens, Van Dyck and
Jordaens. Yet the aim of this exhibition is to shed light on the other
talents, their pupils, friends, and competitors.
With 150 paintings by no less than 79 Antwerp masters, it offers an ample
tour d'horizon of an artistic centre which at that time enjoyed a reputation
which can only be compared with the dominance of Paris in the 19th century.
However, the show which should have been the perfect curtain-raiser to
Antwerpen '93, the festival marking Antwerp's time as cultural capital of
Europe, sells itself short.
Previously the exhibition was in Cologne where, by all reports, it looked a
far better thing than it does in the downstairs galleries of the Royal
Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp. Here, paintings are hung on a horrible
system of steel braces. Flanders should really look to her greatest
treasure. The time must surely be near for a major renovation of a gallery
which houses one of the world's most evocative collections of paintings.
Time and cash were perhaps not sufficient to allow redecoration ahead of the
Festival. But what about some elementary housekeeping? Grass sprouting from
the steps, torn and dirty curtains in gallery windows, a blown light-bulb
casting shadow on a picture - those are easy enough defects to put right. A
narrow strip of carpet running around the edge of the galleries allows the
warders to sing out the moment anyone steps forward. It also has the
depressing effect of making visitors patrol it as if it was a cat-walk.
The paintings are hung in a way intended to show the sheer breadth of types
of painting for which Antwerp's artists were famed. The true centre of
gravity of the show is post-1600, by which time subjects which were
novelties to artists 50 years earlier had reached a wonderful pitch of
expertise.
The mid-16th century saw Antwerp at the apogee of her wealth and status, and
then enter into the long decline after the Spanish closed the Scheldt. Yet
this made no difference to Antwerp's fame as an exporter of paintings - and
also of artists. It is impossible to avoid speaking about 'factories' and
'production lines' in an epoch in which dealers sent Antwerp middlemen
orders for paintings by the hundred.
From Naples and Paris to Peru, demand was unquenchable for the wide skills
of the Antwerp workshops. History painting, landscapes, battle-scenes,
scenes of peasant life, shipwrecks, still-lives, paintings to record
art-collections; the selection of works, many from private collections,
ought to convey the right message about the intense specialisation of
artists in this period. Unfortunately, the organisers of the exhibition
appear to have wanted only to commune with fellow-specialists in Flemish
art.
The result is an inexcusable shortage of information about anything lay
visitors might want to know. Nothing is said about the career of individual
artists, and even their dates do not appear on the labels. There is nothing
about the political and social background. If only these things could be
easily followed up in the catalogue, it would be different; however, the
logic behind this heavy volume is unfathomable.
It is sad to have so many grumbles about the presentation of this rare hors
d'oeuvre to Antwerpen '93. And yet, without question it is an achievement to
have brought together so many paintings of singular beauty, rarity, and
fascination.
Of course, there are many unfamiliar artists to discover. Take Pieter Van
Mol, an obscure contemporary of Van Dyck who settled permanently to Paris.
His 'Descent from the Cross' from Rheims is a remarkable composition in
which Christ's body, painted with painful realism, is held upright in the
centre of the canvas by the holy mourners.
Theodor Van Thulden, an important member of Rubens's 'factory', also moved
for a while to Paris but later went back to Antwerp. His 'Flanders, Brabant,
and Hainault Venerating the Virgin and Child' of 1650, is a magnificently
graceful exercise in political flattery. The provinces, represented as
well-dressed ladies, render up their prayers. Gold coins tumble down, the
benefits of the wise governance of Catholic Spain.
Every visitor will find paintings they particularly warm too - assuming they
resist the pressure of the catwalk to pace along by, rather than looking
with care. But the question needs always to be remembered, what are we
looking at, a master or a team-effort? So often one skilled hand would add
the animals to a landscape, another the flowers in a devotional painting.
Hieronymus Francken painted the portrait of a lady at the virginals; his
less-skilled nephew filled in the dancing company. As ever, argument rages
over whether such a scene paints a moral. It could be a merry inn where
Joachim Beuckelaer's cooks are preparing a hugely carnivorous dinner. Or is
it a brothel?
Among the loans from an impressive number of major collections one of the
most familiar masterpieces is Van Dyck's 'Portrait of Isabella Brant' from
Washington. From the Hermitage come two wonderfully harmonious paintings by
Rubens and Jordaens. The first is Rubens's scene of a group of peasants on
the edge of a spinney, who languidly make love and listen to the sound of a
flute. The landscape is a sunny one, lit spectacularly by a double rainbow.
The Hermitage's second superb loan is Jordaens's earliest homage to his
family. It was painted in 1615, the year he was admitted as a member of the
painters' Guild of St Luke, so perhaps that over-worked phrase could be
used, a rite de passage. The family group clusters almost oppressively close
around the table. On the women's faces we read maternal love and pious
resignation, for above their heads play three golden-haired angels, the
infants who had not lived. Jordaens himself cuts a debonair figure, playing
the lute. However, he is seated so close to the only other adult male, his
father, that he is surely making a statement that the Jordaens family assets
are safe in his talented hands.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Arts: Giselle - Ballet in Antwerp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago Belgium had three ballet companies. In Brussels, Maurice
Bejart reigned with his Ballet du Vingtieme Siecle as dance guru to Europe.
French-speaking Wallonie had its own Ballet Royal, and Flanders an equally
Royal Koninklijk Ballet. But Bejart went to Lausanne, and in 1988 Mark
Morris arrived for a three-year stay in Brussels' Monnaie Opera. In 1990,
the death of the Ballet de Wallonie's director brought the end of the
company, and today only the Royal Ballet of Flanders remains to uphold the
ideals of classical dancing. (In Brussels, Anna Teresa de Keersmaekeer's
free dance now occupies the Monnaie stage; elsewhere other Belgian
modernists flourish - not least Wim van der Keybus).
Flanders' Royal Ballet is based in Antwerp. It was founded in 1969, and it
has been directed for the past six years by Robert Denvers. Denvers has
given the company a sure identity based upon 19th century traditionalism,
modern full-length works, and shorter creations from Balanchine, Tudor et
al.
The troupe's image is of a serious and disciplined ensemble of 55 dancers -
Denvers is also a celebrated pedagogue - and performances during the past
few years, in serious stagings of La Sylphide, Don Quixote, have been marked
by a clear and well-mannered classic style. (The dancers, who come from many
countries, seem united by Denvers' teaching, and by his high technical
expectations).
Last week-end saw the first performances of the company's new Giselle in
Antwerp's Opera House. The staging, produced by Denvers and the Cuban
ballerina, Menia Martinez, pleases by its clarity. There is little of that
fuss of Victorian quaintness which is supposed to evoke 'Romantic style',
and is more like epidemic winsomeness. Nowhere are there those anxieties and
caprices that tell of producers' imposing their 'vision' upon the ballet, as
in the risible Giselle at the Paris Opera with its witless Breton setting.
The Flanders version lets the dance speak (the text is sound, and seems
based upon a Kirov model), and is blessed in its simplicities. Roger
Bernard's designs - practical, well-made cottages and graves set against
pale back-cloths; pretty costumes - are efficient, and designed for touring,
since the company travels extensively. The abiding impression is of a
Giselle that is clearly placed within the great Russian traditions of the
ballet. (My one cavil is that the lines of wilis in Act 2 come between the
lovers and the cross on Giselle's grave which must protect them from
Myrtha).
The sense of tradition was clear in the interpretations of two young
ballerinas whom I saw. Lorena Feijoo is 21 years old, Cuban, and a born
Giselle. She is slender, with a gently commanding technique - balances
hover; steps poise and hang upon a breath of air - and she brings a total
concentration upon the drama. Apprentice Giselles tend to run amok in the
mad-scene. Miss Feijoo played it with a control of effects that was never
studied, but, like her dancing, seemed the expression of a naturally
eloquent and elegant temperament. As the wili Giselle her poses, the turn of
her head, a floating delicacy in step, told of a role whose pathos (and
whose prodigious demands) she already understood. It was a reading most
touching, and most promising.
Her Albrecht was Chris Roelandt, strong and considerate as a partner, and
proposing a sympathetic character whose decencies are seen in his good
manners and exemplary attention to his ballerina. A second Giselle  - of the
five whom the Flanders Ballet are to present - was the Bulgarian Nadia
Dimitrova. Here was a young artist whose training had, like Feijoo's,
already placed her in the best traditions of the role. Her Giselle was
lively in temperament as in step. Quick accents, quick feelings, told the
story in the first act - perhaps slightly self-consciously so. As the wili,
Dimitrova compelled attention by the purity and generosity of her line, and
by her evident desire to show phrases of movement as a kind of bel canto.
Her Albrecht was the Cuban danseur Julio Arozarena, a vivid performer with a
bright edge to his dancing.
The support from the company was alert, attractive, at both performances.
The nocturnal dances of the second act were led by two impressive Myrthas:
Enrichetta Cavalotti and Lucinda Tallack-Garner (who has a space-devouring
jump). The peasant pas de deux, in the broadly flowing Bolshoy version, was
brightly cut by Hiroko Sakakibara and Francois Petit. And, how good and how
rare to report, the Adam score was a vital component in the drama. It was
played (in John Lanchbery's edition) with evident affection by the orchestra
of the Flanders Opera under the young conductor Koen Kessels. Mr Kessels
understood the music's shape, its dramatic purpose, its Romantic force: he
gave a notable display of musicianship.

Two London music schools, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy,
have been involved in a merger, which was set in place last September. The
London Royal Schools' Vocal Faculty is the result: facilities from the vocal
and operatic teaching departments of both bodies are now being shared, and
jointly funded, under the stewardship of Robert Tear (Artistic Adviser) and
James Lockhart (Director of Opera).
The most immediately visible product of the union will be the opera shows -
Don Giovanni just opened at the RAM theatre, The Turn of the Screw at the
RCM next month, others to follow - whose alternating casts and production
forces draw on the newly shared resources. For instance, this new Mozart
production is conducted by Mr Lockhart (based at the RCM) and produced by
Graziella Sciutti, a much-loved Mozart, Rossini and Donizetti soprano now
active at the RCM in a teaching capacity.
No-one in his or her right mind would seek to disgorge runes and portents
from Monday's opening performance. It was, however, full of positive
features, which can be taken to indicate the general strengths of the London
schools' just now: their ability to attract promising material from across
national boundaries, and their luck in having both Mr Lockhart and Miss
Sciutti involved in their pedagogical activities. The RAM Opera Orchestra
produced impressively solid, vigorous support throughout the evening.
The first cast boasts two singers of outstanding gifts - the Ottavio of
Ya-Lin Zhang (a physically stiff but free-throated, Italianate tenor) and
the Elvira of Susannah Glanville (a fresh-voiced, mettlesome, strongly
expressive soprano). Also on show are a Leporello (Paul McNamara) and an
Anna (Susan Strangward) not quite 'finished' but rich in promise, and a
strikingly young-looking Giovanni (James Lawrence) whose vocal facility and
personality need only the natural benefits of greater experience.
All the singers seem to have benefited from Miss Sciutti's vibrant
engagement with the text and her alertness to character detail. This opera's
mesh of emotional complexity and plot intricacy is particularly difficult
for young people to convey, yet there was little sense of faltering in
weaving its dramatic and musical web.
One question-mark hangs over the production, though: the design style,
murky, cumbersome and '50s-ish, offers the students no chance to make
contact with the more up-to-date modes and manners of opera-staging they
will doubtless encounter on leaving college. It is devoutly to be hoped that
this forward-looking new concept in operatic education will allow its
students to look forward in every possible way.
Last performance tomorrow

FT  12 FEB 93 / Arts: Night after Night - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Neil Bartlett is a playwright, translator, director and performer, and this
sheer diversity makes him one of the more ubiquitous figures in British
theatre. The National has presented his translations: Racine's Berenice in
1990 and Marivaux's The Game of Love and Chance (current). Last year, the
Lyric, Hammersmith, presented his adaptation of Ruth Rendell's A Judgement
in Stone. He also co-directed the latter two: which, like several other
shows involving him, were produced by Gloria - a production company set up
in 1988 to present work by him and three other artists.
Much of Bartlett's work advances pro-gay sentiments, and all of it expresses
a gay sensibility. His latest offering, Night after Night, is the most
direct treatment of gayness that I have seen by him. Also the most
autobiographical. A one-man show (with accompaniment by Nicolas Bloomfield),
it begins with the premise that he, Bartlett, bears a close physical
resemblance to his own father. And then he flips back to become his father
in 1958, the year of his birth. His father-to-be is taking his mother-to-be
to a musical. 'The show is about to begin.'
Bartlett then becomes the theatre manager, the coat-check man, and the
barman: who are all - well, confirmed bachelors. So are most of the
chorus-boys. Yes, 1950s musicals are wonderfully touching, but isn't it
funny how they speak to gay people as directly as to straights? And isn't it
ironic that a ritual as heterosexual as a 1950s musical should be framed by
so many gay men (front of house, in the chorus, and so on)? And didn't
Bartlett pere ever notice this then? But it is 1958, the year in which
Bartlett fils will be born.
A reexamination of art and history and family biography is a standard and
necessary part of gay liberation. But Night after Night's use of self is
thoroughly awkward. It wants to be (a) a tour de force in which Bartlett
impresses us by being several different men; (b) a private argument (Didn't
you ever see any gayness around that straight illusion, Dad?) shared with us
all; and (c) Bartlett's treatment of the theme of homosexual participation
in heterosexual art. It wants its audience to cry: (a) 'Bravo, star'; (b)
'Us too, Neil'; and (c) 'Alpha plus, Bartlett.'
You need to be a larger artist than Bartlett to bring all this off. Bartlett
can impersonate the gay front-of-house theatre staff with some malicious
panache. As his own straight father, however, he is a cypher. Night after
Night tickles its audience's fancy, but it reeks too of a tricky mixture of
self-indulgence, what-about-me self-pity, and self-advertisement. Bartlett
talks of the heterosexual world as if it existed beyond the green baize
door, and as if he inhabited the servants' hall downstairs. He imagines
being part of it, and yet he cannot imagine its nervous system.
Royal Court, Theatre Upstairs, until February 13

'When you read a brilliantly elegant and ironic novel by Jane Austen, do you
think of colonial slavery?'. Quite a question. If you don't, then it is time
you thought a little more deeply, according to Edward Said. In Arena (BBC 2,
9.30), the ubiquitous Palestinian writer and academic presents the thesis of
his recent book about the complex overlap of Europe's culture and
imperialism.
Robert McBride (C4, 8.00) is an ANC guerrilla who was sentenced to death for
bombing a Durban bar and killing three people. He was released last year
under the terms of the general amnesty. In this interview he talks about his

The irritations of Gardens without Borders (C4, 9.00), are so great that the

Who on earth cares that next week the party of Britons touring around
gardens in France is going to be joined by an Olympic show jumper? Why not a
manufacturer of pork pies?
However, tonight's episode does offer a lure in the form of a visit to the
garden of Anita Pereire, queen of French gardening.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Technology: On the scent of a bestsmeller - Della Bradshaw
discovers why synthetic perfumes are beginning to outperform their natural
counterparts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dream of every perfumer is not fields of purple lavender nor hillsides
covered in bright yellow mimosa - not even gardens full of sweet-smelling
roses. It is the one synthetic chemical that will give that most elusive of
products - the best-selling fragrance.
For although a perfume may boast high notes of jasmine or undertones of
musk, these days the vast majority of perfume oils are produced in a
chemistry laboratory rather than a field.
'The trend is towards more synthetic components,' points out Terry Goodacre,
senior perfumer at Drogoco, one of the dozen fragrance and flavour companies
now employed by the top perfume houses to develop new perfumes. He
acknowledges that naturally-derived oils 'always have the edge', because
each fragrance oil can be made up of thousands of individual chemical
components, each in minute proportions.
But recent developments in synthesising oils that replicate natural flower
fragrances, and the development of completely new chemical components, are
beginning to rival - and even outperform - their natural counterparts.
One big advantage of synthetic oils is that they are less expensive than
their natural equivalents. Grasse, in the south of France, for example,
provided many of the flowers for the perfume industry until tourism pushed
up the price of land along the French coast and made large-scale flower
cultivation uneconomical. It takes a tonne of jasmine flowers to produce
just a few kilos of perfume oil.
The price, quality and supply of synthetics can also be guaranteed. When
frost hit the Californian orange crop in December 1991, for example, the
price of natural orange oil soared. And until recently, perfumers have
imported much of their oak moss and lavender from the former Yugoslavia and
many of the resinous fragrances from Somalia. There are now fears that
supplies from both these areas could be jeopardised.
The art of the chemist is twofold. First, scientists have to formulate a
chemical oil that is as near as possible to the natural source.
Traditionally, that has been done by extracting the oil from the plant and
then analysing it. But many of the latest high-priced perfumes have used
fragrances derived by a new method known as 'head space analysis'.
In this, rather than analysing the flower oil, scientists concentrate on the
odour which emanates from the living flower before it is picked. This can be
particularly useful with flowers such as daffodils, from which oil cannot be
extracted.
The volatile substances from the flower are vacuumed up over several hours
or days. The sweet-smelling air is cooled to condense out the fragrant
materials. These are analysed using traditional spectrometry and, if all
goes according to plan, replicated.
The difference between the analysis of a flower oil and the results of the
vacuum method can be 'quite startling', says Goodacre.
One reason for this is that when oils are extracted from flowers, many of
the component chemicals are broken down, affecting the smell.
Analytical techniques used to catalogue the volatile components of a natural
oil have now become so sophisticated that they can identify those that
appear in minute quantities - just a few parts per million. So chemists can
go back to popular flowers - the rose is the obvious case - and synthesise
these trace chemicals so that the artificial rose oil smells even more like
that from the original flower.
Second, and more excitingly, chemists are discovering new fragrant
components. 'All the time we're looking for new smells, we're all striving
for this new component,' says Tony Mills, chief perfumer with Bush Boake
Allen, the fragrance and flavour company. 'With chemistry, we can come up
with a whole new direction.'
Few perfumers even dare to believe that they will concoct the second Chanel
No 5 - a constant bestseller since it was introduced in 1923. What they hope
for is a fragrance which other perfume houses will be forced to emulate.
Failing that, they aspire to create a novel fragrance by experimenting with
existing chemicals in innovative mixes. Typically, each perfume is a blend
of 30 to 50 different oils, although a complex blend can contain up to 200
components.
'It's very exciting to build a winning fragrance around an ingredient that
has been on the shelf all the time,' says Mills. On the BBA shelves there
are up to 1,300 different chemicals.
Once a perfume is created, the novel element can be used in the marketing.
The Japanese cosmetics company, Shiseido, for example, heavily promotes its
new perfume, Feminite du Bois, on its sultry ingredient, cedarwood.
Industry experts reckon that in spite of the frequency of perfume launches
in the past few years, truly innovative fragrances have been few and far
between. In the late 1970s, for example, Ralph Lauren introduced Lauren,
with its distinctive blackcurrant note. Other perfume houses followed with
other fruity fragrances.
Most recently, Aramis launched New West for Her, with its clean melon
fragrance which other perfume houses are still trying to emulate.
One reason, believes Astra West, fragrance evaluation manager with BBA, is
that once a perfume reaches the market evaluation stage, consumers
invariably opt for something comforting rather than something challenging.
'The familiar always wins,' says West. And with that in mind, few brand
managers are prepared to stick their necks out in order to back a truly
innovative product with the prospect of losing millions of pounds. 'There
are very few Estee Lauders left in the world, who say that's the one I
want,' adds West.
Creating a new perfume is inevitably a complex process. 'It's a bit like in
advertising,' says Goodacre. 'The client comes to us with a brief of what
they want and we pitch for the business.'
The brief could be something as general as a marketing strategy - the age of
the potential wearer and lifestyle, say. Other briefs would be more
complicated, identifying specific elements in the fragrance.
One of the biggest problems is interpreting what the client wants. But a
'language of perfumery' has developed - with 'floral notes', 'green notes'
and so on. 'One of the most misinterpreted words I've ever come across is
the word 'fresh',' says West, citing the numerous different interpretations
of the word.
In spite of all the research involved in creating the vital combination of
oils and aromas, as little as 15 per cent of a bottle of perfume is actually
oil, says Peter McDougall, an analyst at BZW, the London securities house.
The most plentiful component is alcohol - 55 per cent - followed by
distilled water. In a bottle of eau de parfum the oil content can be as low
as 8 per cent, and in eau de toilette as low as 4 per cent.
And in terms of the cost of production, the ingredients in a bottle of
perfume account for only 5 per cent of the total outlay, adds McDougall. The
research and development costs a further 5 per cent, and there is the
additional cost of the expensive equipment needed for the distillation
process.
But for those eager to buy their loved ones a bottle of the latest perfume
for Valentine's Day on Sunday, it is sobering to remember that most of its
cost is accounted for not by the fragrance but by sales and marketing
activities, packaging, distribution, and, of course, the profit margin.

The developers, SB Chemicals, of Lisburn, Co Antrim, believe the product
reduces the amount of unnecessary chemicals used in domestic washing
machines.
A measured dose of the anhydrous (waterless) washing liquid is encapsulated
in a water-soluble sachet, which is placed on top of the soiled clothes in
the washing machine. The film around the sachet is also active in the

A low-cost monitor intended to save the lives of babies at risk from cot
death has won first prize in the Toshiba Year of Invention competition for
an 18-year-old Scottish schoolboy.
The Breathe Sure monitor should sell for about Pounds 60, compared with
several hundreds of pounds for the monitors used in many hospitals. An
Edinburgh company of medical equipment suppliers, JMW Systems, is already
building prototypes.
The Breathe Sure sensor, which is attached to a cloth belt, picks up the
infant's breathing. Each time a breath is detected a green light flashes on
the electronic monitor which is hung from the cot or pram. Should breathing
stop or become irregular an alarm sounds. JMW Systems: UK, 031 440 3633.

US institutional investors, out of whose bottle the genie of corporate
governance first crept, are exporting their activism abroad.
According to a study* published yesterday by the Boston-based Institutional
Responsibility Research Centre, US shareholders have nearly doubled the
number of ballots they are casting at overseas corporate meetings. In 1992,
US institutions exercised their vote on 40 per cent of their non-US stock,
up from 24 per cent the year before.
UK institutions fare badly by contrast. The National Association of Pension
Funds in 1991 found that fewer than 20 per cent of British institutions
voted on share resolutions for stocks in their home market, though the NAPF
says such apathy may be changing.
American investors are increasingly taking as hostile a stance abroad as in
the US, where they have toppled senior management at IBM, American Express
and General Motors. Board positions were opposed in 7.8 per cent of cases in
1992, up from 3.5 per cent in 1991, the survey found. 'With more than
Dollars 250bn (Pounds 166bn) worth of international stock at stake, US
shareholders are saying they can't afford to ignore the hazards of different
corporate governance practices abroad,' said Stephen Davis, director of
IRRC's Global Shareholder Service.
However, the study finds that non-American corporations are fighting back
against institutional activism. Many German corporations appear to be
deleting shareholder proposals from proxy materials and ballots sent to US
investors, while most US investor votes cast at annual meetings of UK,
Australian and Canadian annual meetings are never counted.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ann Bowtell has been appointed First Civil Service Commissioner, responsible
for selection to the senior civil service and for the fast-stream entry
programme. Bowtell, 54, is the first woman to be appointed to the post.
A graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, Bowtell was herself a fast-stream
trainee, joining the National Assistance Board in 1960. Her career in the
department of health and social security (which replaced the NAB) has been
largely in policy, personnel and resource management. She is currently
deputy secretary at the department of health, where she is the principal
establishment and finance officer.
Bowtell is particularly well-qualified to help the civil service achieve its
aim of attracting more women to its top ranks, and retaining them after they
start families. A mother of four, she continued to work part-time while her
children were young.
She replaces John Holroyd, who was recently appointed Prime Minister's
appointments secretary, with responsibility for church appointments and some
special academic jobs.
Bowtell will be replaced at the health department by Joe Pilling, 47, the
former director-general of the Prison Service. Pilling won respect for his
work at the prison service, and had been expected to continue in charge when
it achieved executive agency status this year. However, the home secretary
selected an outsider, Derek Lewis, former chief executive of Granada Group.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Management: Beat the Budget with solid gold - Tim Dickson on
hedging your bets against March 16
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Psst] Fancy being paid in gold bars, diamonds or even cocoa beans? Bizarre
as it seems a growing number of UK companies have been turning to
commodity-based bonus schemes, which tax experts reckon may be costing the
government tens of millions of pounds in 'lost' National Insurance revenue.
The present popularity of the schemes is attributable to two main factors: a
growing fear that the chancellor may raise the level of NI contributions in
next month's Budget, and suspicion that he could crack down on apparent
loopholes at the same time.
National Insurance planning is one of several issues for companies to
consider before Lamont gets to his feet on March 16. Corporations do not
have the same range of opportunities to beat the Budget as individuals: but
a checklist of possible boardroom actions can be compiled.
Accountants and lawyers say NI is a big preoccupation for companies - hardly
surprising perhaps given that it is already such a nice little earner for
the chancellor.
Raising more income tax would be widely decried as a political U-turn, which
is why Lamont may find it more attractive to raise additional revenue
through National Insurance. Controversially, he could take a leaf out of the
Labour party's last election manifesto and raise or remove the Pounds 21,060
ceiling above which the employees' National Insurance contribution is not
paid. But a more plausible option might be to lift the present 10.4 per cent
rate which companies pay on most salaries.
Present NI rules exempt staff bonuses paid in the form of marketable
commodities rather than money from both employer and employee contributions.
MAI, the financial services group, attracted considerable attention before
the last election by making payments to some staff in gold bullion.
Diamonds can also be used, while factory workers at the Presbar group were
recently reported to be receiving part of their remuneration in cocoa beans.
A scheme involving bonus payments in unit trusts was ended in 1991.
Obviously, employees do not take physical delivery: in a typical scheme the
commodities are credited to their name and sold for cash within a couple of
days of being bought. Value Added Tax on gold can be avoided provided the
purchase is routed through an offshore centre like Switzerland.
John Valentine, a tax partner with Grant Thornton, points out that employees
also enjoy the benefit of deferring income tax. He nevertheless cautions
against setting up a scheme of less than Pounds 100,000. 'The Revenue may
choose to challenge individual cases, and unless every single document is
word perfect they may fail. It could be a time consuming and expensive
process.'
Other accountants say some clients are reluctant to enter into arrangements
which could upset their relations with the Inland Revenue.
Valentine emphasises that the scheme only works for bonuses, not for the
employee's basic remuneration (where the company has a contractual
obligation to pay).
National Insurance is not the sole pre-Budget tax topic for management
in-trays.
Take Advance Corporation Tax, for instance. An intense lobbying campaign has
been directed at the government over rules which disallow ACT from being
credited against tax paid on overseas profits.
The chances of the chancellor succumbing to the pressure look slim - indeed
he may even clamp down on some of the tax avoidance schemes which have been
put in place.
But as David Reid, tax partner at solicitors Clifford Chance points out: 'If
there is to be a change in the ACT rules there could be advantages for
multinational companies to delay the receipt of dividend payments into the
UK from their overseas subsidiaries until after the Budget.'
Companies will also want to keep a close eye on any moves in the Budget to
tax company cars on the basis of their market value. In the meantime,
executives with their eye on a new model which costs, say, more than Pounds
19,250 - the current definition of an executive car - may want to wait and
see how Lamont changes the current banding system. This way they may be able
to buy a bigger car without the additional tax cost incurred at the moment.
Business proprietors who think personal tax rates are set to rise,
meanwhile, may want to take advantage of the opportunity to 'dividend strip'
before the end of the tax year.
The point here is that dividends, unlike salaries, are free from NI
contributions and thanks to the offsetting effect of ACT can be extracted
from a company at a tax rate of just 20 per cent. This would increase if the
chancellor raised the top rate of personal tax - currently 40 per cent -
though there would still be time to take action for this year before April
5.
Tony Allen of Coopers and Lybrand warns companies to beware of exchange
differences when disposing of overseas assets. There is some expectation
that the government may in the forthcoming Budget remove the current anomaly
which means businesses incur capital gains tax on a paper profit. But it
would be unwise to count on it.

FT  12 FEB 93 / People: Orderly succession at Shell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Jennings, who has been with the Royal Dutch/Shell group for over 30
years, will take over the chairmanship of the British arm, Shell Transport
and Trading, when Sir Peter Holmes retires at the end of June.
The Royal Dutch/Shell Group is the world's second biggest oil company and
its management succession tends to be orderly and dictated by a retirement
age of 60. Sir Peter, who has been chairman since 1985, was 60 last
September and it had been expected that he would hand over the chair to the
next most senior of the three British group managing directors.
Jennings, 55, has been a group managing director since July 1987 and has
come up on the exploration side of the group. Having graduated in geology
from Birmingham University in 1958, he was awarded a Shell research
studentship enabling him to obtain his PhD in geology from Edinburgh.
He spent his early career exploring for oil overseas. In 1979 he was
appointed managing director of Shell UK exploration and production and in
1985 was made exploration and production co-ordinator for the Shell group
based in The Hague.
Sir Peter Holmes, like his predecessor Sir Peter Baxendell, will remain on
the board after he retires but his role as chairman of the joint committee
of the service companies of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group will be taken by Cor
Herkstroter, president of Royal Dutch Petroleum.
Jennings will become vice chairman of the committee but given that he is of
a similar age to Herkstroter, the most senior position in the group is
likely to continue to be dominated by the Dutch side. Traditionally, the
post has rotated between a British and Dutch chairman. But the differences
in ages has meant that the Dutch have tended to hold the job longer than
their British colleagues. Sir Peter Holmes, for example, was close to
retirement when he became chairman of that committee last June.

STOREHOUSE acted quickly yesterday to plug the gaps while it searches for a
new chief executive after David Dworkin's decision to leave for Carter
Hawley Hale in the US.
Graham Rider, group finance director, was appointed acting managing director
of the BhS store chain in addition to his existing responsibilities. Ann
Iverson, the former colleague whom Dworkin brought from the US to help him
at BhS, and then promoted to chief executive at Mothercare, was appointed to
the Storehouse board.
*****
Alan Goodhill yesterday resigned from his position at Morgan Stanley
International in London. Goodhill, 44, had been head of European equities
for the past three years, and had worked for the firm since 1982.
A Morgan Stanley official says resignation came as 'a surprise', adding that
Goodhill planned to 'enjoy some time with his family'. Goodhill himself was
not available for comment, having already departed from Morgan Stanley's
Docklands headquarters by mid-afternoon in line with the firm's policy.
*****
FENNER, the Hull-based power transmission, industrial conveyer belts and
fluid power group, yesterday announced the appointment with immediate effect
of Julian Bigden as group managing director.
Bigden, 48, replaces Tom Brown, who has resigned. The move was unexpected,
but Peter Barker, Fenner's chairman, said: 'It's pretty tough out there, and
I think Tom took the view that he would like to pursue other interests.'
The new md, who remains president of the US company, has been with Fenner
for about 20 years, and over the past 10 years has successfully transformed
Fenner's US operations into a number of profitable and growing businesses
under the umbrella of Fenner Inc.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Management: Rise of the ambassador manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Country managers used to be the barons, if not the kings, of most
multinational companies. But now most of them are being cut down to the size
of mere ambassadors.
As their companies strive to accelerate decision-taking, to slash head
office costs, and to achieve greater all-round global co-ordination and
efficiency, most of their power - sometimes even over sales and distribution
 -is being transferred either to regional czars, or more often to the heads
of worldwide product divisions.
As a result many country managers have either been pensioned off early, or
are suffering severe demotivation as they bow to the inevitable relegation
of their role.
In a growing number of companies, such as ICI, Britain's largest chemicals
combine, 'country management' is being reduced to a part-time
representational role, carried out by a senior divisional manager (see this
page, Feb 1).
But should the fate of country managers be so inevitable? Is it even
sensible?
Or should companies treat them in a less standardised way, adapting their
role more carefully to the company's stage of organisational evolution, and
to each country's different conditions?
There is nothing either inevitable or sensible about a blanket approach,
according to the initial findings of a study being undertaken by John
Quelch, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
Companies should think far more carefully about what kind of country manager
they need in each national situation, says Quelch. They should also
recognise that, even when it is sensible to transfer most power to global
divisions, country managers can be motivated by developing new skills. These
include encouraging the export and import of good ideas between
subsidiaries.
Quelch is now extending his study to 200 country general managers. So far it
has been based on interviews with 50 executives in 12 Asian, European and
North American multinationals in services, consumer and industrial products.
The executives' responses range from demotivation to surprising expressions
of secret content at a narrowing of their responsibilities.  - so long as
they retain their titles, that is.
In a working paper called The New Country Managers which describes his
initial conclusions*, Quelch quotes one executive, presumably of the
demotivated variety, saying lugubriously that his type of role will not
actually disappear, since 'governments still need one man to go after, to
put in jail'.
Quelch's categorisation of country managers is in line with a suggestion in
his paper that companies are evolving through several stages towards a
relatively standard 'global' type of organisation.
This would be disputed by fellow academics: some Japanese and other
companies are moving in the reverse direction, from centralised global to a
much more complex and flexible structure which has become known as
'transnational'.
But Quelch's four-stage categorisation is useful all the same:
When a company goes international, it may establish wholly-owned country
subsidiaries in its larger, more promising markets, sometimes acquiring
local distributors. The company managers needed for these young subsidiaries
are 'traders' who focus primarily on sales and distribution.
To achieve local market penetration, the company devolves more functional
responsibilities to country managers. They develop and manufacture an ever
broader line of locally adapted products. The company becomes a genuine
'multinational' and country managers, evaluated on the profits they deliver,
become 'potentates'.
To achieve the benefits of greater integration of its activities on a
'transnational' basis, the company reduces the country manager's
decision-making authority over research and development, purchasing and
manufacturing. It consolidates these functions in centres of excellence
(which may be regional or global). Marketing decision are shifted to the
regional level. The country manager remains involved, but has to be a team
player, a 'cabinet member'.
In fully 'global' organisations, worldwide divisions (or 'lines-of
business') dominate the organisation. The country manager is now an
'ambassador'.
Since most multinationals are at varying stages of development around the
world, they need more than one type of country manager - a portfolio with
different sets of skills, Quelch argues.
A European consumer goods company, for instance, might appoint 'cabinet
members' as country managers in an increasingly integrated Europe, but put
'traders' into Asia, where markets are growing faster and national
socio-economic differences are greater. Meanwhile the 'potentates' who run
the company's operations in Latin America, where tariff barriers still limit
cross-border commerce, might still remain in place.
Country managers should become a mixed breed of high-fliers, in other words,
not a cloned race of almost has-beens.
*An edited version of the paper will be published in the next issue of the
McKinsey Quarterly, available at the end of this month.

FT  12 FEB 93 / The Property Market: Death-knell for the speculative venture
 -Developers must learn from the errors of the 1980s - and from Keynes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD BARRAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent publication of the second volume of Robert Skidelsky's biography
of Keynes, The Economist as Saviour, offers a timely insight into the
economic debates of the inter-war depression. These debates take on a new
relevance today, as the British economy struggles to emerge from the longest
recession of the post-war period. They are particularly pertinent to an
assessment of the impact of the 1980s' property boom upon the wider
prospects for the British economy in the 1990s.
One of Keynes' great concerns was the tendency for savings to exceed the
perceived investment opportunities in a mature economy such as Britain's.
Uncertainty about the returns from slow-maturing capital investment projects
tends to depress the rate of investment, but also to boost the rate of
savings as a defensive measure. A rapid expansion in credit can temporarily
overcome the imbalance. This typically leads to a speculative boom in the
equities and property markets, as in the late-1980s.
However, when the supply of credit is cut, the boom collapses and creates
the risk of a prolonged slump - as happened in the 1930s and could recur in
the 1990s.
Keynes identified channels into which savings could be diverted if
investment in new domestic capital projects seems too risky. These include
hoarding in the form of money deposits, purchase of existing assets and
investment overseas. All such forms of saving add to the store of wealth,
but not to the stock of capital goods. Consequently they are deflationary
because they represent a non-productive diversion of purchasing power away
from the demand for goods and services.
To this list we should add the more speculative forms of property
development. For even when savings are being invested in new capital
formation, the extent to which such investment is contributing to the
productive capacity of the economy can vary enormously.
It is a long-standing characteristic of the UK economy that less productive
forms of investment tend to find favour over investment in new industrial
plant and machinery. In part this reflects the traditional dominance of the
City of London over provincial manufacturing interests, a legacy which has
encouraged a strong 'rentier' tendency among owners of capital.
This tendency encourages the view that the purchase of existing equities or
property is safer than investment in new capital projects. However, Keynes
thought that as real interest rates and investment returns fell, in response
to a growing surplus of capital, then the result would be the 'euthanasia of
the 'rentier'.
Instead the opposite has happened. The demand for capital is stronger than
ever: to fund Britain's growing trade and budget deficits and to meet the
borrowing requirements of individuals.
Consequently, real interest rates are as high as they have ever been. At the
same time the tax regime encourages personal savings in the form of house
ownership and pension schemes. We are all rentiers now. Our direct concern
is to accumulate wealth which yields an immediate return.
Inevitably the same rentier mentality pervades those financial institutions
which invest savings on our behalf. Hence the short-termism of City
investors. Hence a commercial property industry which strives to produce
what it believes to be 'institutionally acceptable' rather than
'occupationally desirable' buildings. The result is a self-defeating
tendency to develop too many high specification buildings without adequate
reference to their productive potential.
The 1980s building boom has been an example of this tendency. The trigger
was financial deregulation and the motor was the credit expansion generated
by deregulation.
However, this credit has not been directed to rebuilding the UK's
manufacturing base. Rather, it has been used to fuel an unsustainable growth
in consumption and to fund the construction of too many shopping centres and
London offices.
All the leading economies with the exception of the US enjoyed an investment
boom in the second half of the 1980s. In general this boom was biased
towards plant and machinery investment, which expanded by as much as 45 per
cent over the five years, compared with only a 16 per cent increase in
non-residential building.
Britain was the exception. It showed the highest increase in non-residential
building investment of any of the G7 economies and the lowest increase in
investment in plant and machinery. As a result it was the only one of the G7
to experience a lower rate of expansion of investment in machinery than in
building.
The implications of the contrasting profiles of investment in the UK and
Germany are chastening. While the UK has been building marble-lined temples
of commerce, the Germans have been pouring money into rebuilding the
industrial base of eastern Germany. It is difficult to believe that the
Germans' investment will not show the greater payback in the next 10 years.
The UK's missed opportunity is all the more serious because it lessens its
ability to take advantage of sterling's recent devaluation to generate an
export-led recovery.
However, the 1990s may be the decade of reckoning. The UK economy has been
running a substantial trade deficit even in the depths of recession.
Manufacturing output has fallen from 30 per cent of GDP in the mid-1970s to
just 23 per cent at the beginning of the 1990s. The emergence of some sort
of industrial regeneration strategy, however painful, seems inevitable. Less
likely, would be a radical switch in incentives from personal savings to
corporate investment.
What would such a shift in priorities imply for the property industry? It
means increased demand for modern industrial property; greater
infrastructure investment; more modestly specified office and retail
developments attuned to the needs of occupiers and not the perceived needs
of investors; and, across all sectors, less speculative development and more
customised buildings for specific occupiers.
Otherwise the property industry will again be made to pay for the national
weakness for what Skidelsky calls 'the triumph of making money over making
things'.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ready for some tough pounding -
Ralph Atkins begins a series, continued on Monday, which looks at options
for departments in the firing line / Public Spending Review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE normally-unflapp-able Tory MP from a south coast seat was worried as he
stood in the Commons' lobby. A flood of letters was bound to come from his
many elderly constituents wanting reassurance about the basic state pension.
What was he to tell them?
The answer is not simple. The government has started the most fundamental
review of public spending for a decade. The unthinkable will be thought in a
bid to stem the inexorable rise of public borrowing. Beyond manifesto
commitments for this parliament, nothing can be guaranteed.
But to many Conservative MPs, the idea of fighting the next election
apparently prepared to dismantle the welfare state is inconceivable.
In its mechanics, the review differs little from the annual public
expenditure round. It will deploy the same Treasury officials who monitor
each department for the annual public expenditure. At the departments it
will be finance divisions, perhaps reinforced with extra personnel, who will
respond. There is no Royal Commission, official inquiry, or even task force.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury and the review's
architect, has already held bilateral talks at three out of the four
departments subject to review first - Mrs Virginia Bottomley, at the health
department, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr John Patten, education
secretary.
He will meet Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, soon. Further
bilaterals are likely, particularly as summer approaches and the first
results are expected.
Rather than taking existing spending programmes and deciding which will rise
or fall, each item of spending will be studied to see whether it should be
the state's responsibility, if waste can be squeezed or the private sector
brought in. Ideas will come from departmental policy divisions and ministers
 -but also crucially from outsiders.
So far, Mr Portillo has made only a tentative start. He had not expected to
make an announcement so soon. Monday's Commons statement was brought forward
because of the press speculation about its scope. Cabinet ministers had to
be briefed hurriedly over the weekend.
To be truly radical, traditional Whitehall culture needs to be reversed.
Spending departments usually defend programmes. The Treasury, if offered an
inch, generally looks for a mile. Free-thinking could become constrained by
the need to plan tactics.
Mr Lilley and Mr Portillo are politically like-minded, unafraid of turning
large parts of the state's responsibilities over to the private sector. But
the three others are closer to Mr John Major's social market Conservatism.
None will resist Mr Portillo's overtures and all will welcome the search for
efficiency savings or more private sector involvement. But Mr Clarke is a
political bruiser who will give ground slowly to the Treasury. Mr Patten and
Mrs Bottomley believe in excellence in state schools and hospitals. The
Conservative 1992 manifesto tied the government to annual increases in 'the
level of real resources committed to the NHS' and to savings through greater
efficiency being ploughed back into the service.
Around Westminster, there is no shortage of ideas or strong words on
scrutinising public spending but less appreciation of current political
realities - that the government has a majority of just 21, is already
wrestling with internal strife over coal, Maastricht and short-term economic
policy.
Economic recovery could rapidly dissipate any sense of urgency and temper
future manifesto pledges. No specific target has been set for cutting
expenditure.
So Mr Portillo is right to emphasise that it is a long term review. His
hopes are to start a debate - fuelled by fears over excessive borrowing and
tax rises - about Conservative priorities in the next century. But tangible
results, in terms of agreement on changes, are far off.
Mrs Judith Chaplin, MP for Newbury and John Major's former political
secretary, says: 'The whole point of such a review, which is going to take a
long time, is that it can look at all aspects of the problem and decide
whether money is being spent in the way that most benefits whoever you are
trying to help.
'If you do that, then it is perfectly possible to get agreement within the
party.'

FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hospital reforms set to proceed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government will press ahead with proposals to merge or slim down some of
London's hospitals after the cabinet agreed yesterday to the plans put
forward by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary.
But some changes will be qualified and others deferred to blunt the overall
political impact of the decisions.
An announcement is expected next week on the response to the report from Sir
Bernard Tomlinson. His report recommends reducing the capital's provision by
2,500 beds to enable more resources to go to London's GP services.
Speaking on BBC Newsnight, Mrs Bottomley highlighted the number of
consultants in central London and the need to use specialist services more
efficiently. 'We must grasp the nettle,' she said.
The white paper will include firm decisions, such as going ahead with the
merger of the Middlesex and University College hospitals and proposals in a
review of specialist services, including the future of the Royal Marsden and
Royal Brompton hospitals.
St Bartholemew's hospital, which has been the focus of a high-profile
campaign against closure, is thought likely to survive, but in a diminished
form. The paper will also set out government plans to expand community care,
and re-organisation plans on a longer timescale.
Although allowing Bart's to continue and by blurring the future of the
specialist hospitals, ministers have avoided some of the most politically
difficult decisions arising from Tomlinson the remaining hospitals under
threat will still pose a problem.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Health cash charges rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS by local authorities that they have been denied the money needed
to properly discharge the new community care responsibilities they assume in
April were rejected by Mr Tim Yeo, junior health minister, in the Commons
last night.
He clashed with Mr David Hinchliffe, a Labour front bench spokesman, who
insisted that senior Conservative councillors - as well as those of other
parties - were seriously worried by the 'huge shortfall in funding'.
Mr Yeo emphasised that in the coming financial year directors of social
services would have Pounds 565m at their disposal as a result of the 'very
generous' provision made by the government.
He dismissed claims by the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan
Authorities that the government should have allocated a further Pounds 250m
as 'totally bogus'.
When Mr Hinchliffe stressed that the Association of County Councils, the
Conservative-controlled local authority organisation, estimated the
shortfall at Pounds 135m, the minister retorted: 'I think those claims are
wholly exaggerated'.
Mr Yeo accused the Association of Metropolitan Authorities of making
unfounded statements suggesting that 12,000 elderly and disabled people
would be at risk of not receiving services.
Such tactics only succeeded in 'frightening and worrying some of society's
most vulnerable people'.
He reaffirmed that apart from the Pounds 565m specifically allocated to
local authorities for community care over Pounds 5.5bn would be made
available by the government from April for existing personal social
services.
Mr Hinchliffe described the government's insistence that the bulk of the
money allocated to local authorities for community care should be channelled
to the independent sector as a 'backdoor method of closing council homes and
reducing choice'.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith attacks rise in crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH yesterday urged the government to act over rising crime rates,
saying it was 'a deplorable indictment of Conservative government' that
crime had more than doubled during the party's years in office, David Owen
writes.
At question time, the Labour leader asked the prime minister whether he
thought it was 'remotely tolerable' that there were 'something like 25,000
break-ins' every week.
'When are you going to do something about protecting our citizens from
that?', Mr Smith asked. Mr John Major argued that the government's record on
combating crime was 'comparable with that of other countries in western
Europe.' Ever since the second world war, crime had increased under all
governments, he said.
'You seem to want to put the blame for each and every thing on the shoulders
of the government,' he told Mr Smith.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory jitters over strategy on
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BATTLE for hearts and minds over the next crucial Maastricht vote was
under way in the Commons yesterday amid widespread doubt among backbenchers
of all parties as to the wisdom of the government's high-risk strategy.
As officials in the Foreign Office began to prepare briefing notes on the
juridical and political implications of a government defeat on the social
chapter, the Euro-sceptics were drafting their own counter-propaganda at a
rival office in Westminster.
In the Commons, however, speculation is mounting as to what would happen in
the event of a government defeat following the unequivocal stance taken by
Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary. Several Conservative backbenchers voiced serious disquiet at the
decision to make vote on Labour's social chapter amendment the acid test of
the prime minister's authority.
With the outcome on a knife-edge, government loyalists backed the tactic.
They argued that Mr Hurd's uncompromising warning that defeat could kill the
treaty will help shore up the Conservatives' narrow 21 vote majority.
However even among these, few believed that he has any chance of achieving
the secondary objective of persuading pro-European Labour and Liberal
Democrats to break ranks with their colleagues to save the treaty.
Furthermore, doubts were spreading to the Tory backbenches over the
government's assertion that approval of the Labour amendment would leave it
a stark choice between accepting the social chapter or sinking the treaty.
A number of Tories who dis-approved of Lord Tebbit's inflammatory speech on
Wednesday, nonetheless, believe him correct in saying the amendment would
make treaty ratification more difficult with no concomitant obligation on
Britain to accept its social protocol.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Tory chairman of the defence select committee, said
yesterday that he had given an undertaking to ministers that he would not
back the social chapter.
But he insisted that he was not certain that this would be the inevitable
consequence of voting for the Labour amendment.
'I would not vote for some-thing that would enforce the social chapter, but
if it does not do that, I remain entirely undecided,' he said.
Several Tory MPs also questioned whether the government's early unveiling of
one of its most powerful sanctions was not a mistake. One even cited Mr
Major's celebrated claim that he was the greatest Euro-sceptic in his
cabinet to suggest that perhaps the government might be unworried by defeat.
'The prime minister has to show his European partners that he has fought as
hard as he could for the treaty,' he observed. 'But if in the end it was
defeated, Mr Major would still be able to make that claim while having
regained a united party.'
Labour business managers believe that the government's only hope of victory
depends on doing a deal with the Ulster unionists.

MR JOHN SMITH yesterday urged the government to act over rising crime rates,
saying it was 'a deplorable indictment of Conservative government' that
crime had more than doubled during the party's years in office.
During exchanges at Commons question time, the Labour leader asked the prime
minister whether he thought it was 'remotely tolerable' that there were
'something like 25,000 break-ins in this country every week.'
'When are you going to do something about protecting our citizens from
that?', Mr Smith asked.
Mr John Major retorted by arguing the government's record on combating crime
was 'comparable with that of other countries in western Europe.' Ever since
the second world war, crime had increased under all governments.
The prime minister said: 'You seem to want to put the blame for each and
every thing on the shoulders of the government . . '
Government action on the problem had included the Public Order Act, the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act, two Criminal Justice Acts, the Prison
Security Act and an Act to ban joyriding, he told Mr Smith, 'each and every
one of which was opposed by you and your party'.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rebels warn coal plans face defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTIVE REBEL Tory MPs yesterday responded to the leaking of a draft
white paper on coal by warning that the government faces a Commons defeat if
it goes ahead with the plans.
Mr Winston Churchill, the Conservative MP for Davyhulme, said the proposals
did not go far enough and would prompt a revolt 'big enough to defeat the
government on the floor of the House'.
He was supported by Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, the Tory MP for Batley and Spen,
who said the plan 'looks like a quick fix for the coal industry. What was
written this morning was not acceptable to a lot of people.'
The warnings came after it emerged that the government's draft plan
envisaged expanding the market for domestic deep-mined coal by about 12m
tonnes a year for five years.
The package has been widely interpreted as implying the rescue of only a
dozen or so pits - based on the traditional scale equating 1m tonnes of coal
to one pit and 1,000 jobs.
But British Coal said yesterday that productivity improvements over the last
year had raised average pit output to about 1.5m tonnes per year. This
rendered the old rule of thumb invalid.
The government draft also came under attack from Mr Richard Caborn, Labour
chairman of the trade and industry committee, whose report on coal
yesterday's proposals largely passed over.
Mr Caborn said the plans would 'do no more than provide a breathing space
for a limited number of pits. It may offer the government a quick political
fix but it would . . . deny the country a unique opportunity to develop a
rational and balanced energy policy.'
But Mr Caborn's decision to call a press conference to 'clarify' last
month's committee report, whose recommendations he said were not 'an a la
carte menu from which government can pick and choose', was itself criticised
by some Tory MPs on the committee.
Mr Keith Hampson, the Conservative MP for Leeds North West, said the matter
would certainly be raised at a future committee meeting.
Mr John Butterfill, Tory MP for Bournemouth West, disagreed with Mr Caborn's
assertion that the recommendations were a package to take or leave. Mr
Caborn's statement had not been discussed with or approved by the committee.
Mr Caborn was accompanied at the press conference by Mr Gerard McCloskey, a
specialist energy journalist, who said the report indicated there should be
'a short-term life' for six pits and an extended life for the other 25.
Later, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, promised a government response to
'every one' of the committee's recommendations.
The government's draft calls for the market for deep-mined coal to be
expanded by adopting a four-pronged approach: blocking imports of
orimulsion, a bitumen-based fuel; slowing the planned rundown of coal
stocks; cutting output from open-cast mines; and using subsidies to halt
growth in coal imports.
One of its chief attractions to the government is that no new legislation
would be needed.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Vauxhall to supply Corsas to BSM driving schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL has won a five-year contract to supply the driving school group BSM
 -the British School of Motoring - with its new Corsa small car.
The exclusive supply contract was previously held by Rover group, which
delivered up to 5,000 Metros annually to BSM for the past decade.
The deal with Vauxhall has a five-year extension option.
If exercised, Vauxhall would supply 50,000 Corsas over 10 years in a deal
worth Pounds 400m at showroom prices.
Typically such large fleet deals involve substantial discounts. Neither BSM
or Vauxhall would discuss the discount issue yesterday, describing the deal
as a joint marketing arrangement going well beyond the supply relationship
BSM previously maintained with Rover.
BSM, which has 2,000 driving instructors franchised at 130 branches, is
increasingly interested in tapping the growing market for the advanced
instruction of company car users.
Vauxhall has a leading share of the company car market, and should be able
to help BSM achieve this aim.
For its part, Vauxhall expects to benefit from the wide exposure the Corsa
can expect to receive as the BSM's only 'school' car. The General Motors
subsidiary wants to attract young drivers to the model.
Deliveries are to start in July, three months after the Spanish-built Corsa
goes on sale in the UK.
The Corsa, which will replace the Nova in the UK and is also to be built at
Eisenach in eastern Germany, is expected by GM to become one of Europe's
biggest-selling cars.
GM invested more than Pounds 500m in its development and production, and
plans to produce more than 500,000 units a year.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Lottery could generate jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLANNED National Lottery will generate many jobs, according to a report
for the National Heritage Department.
About 1,000 jobs will be created in the lottery organisation and hundreds
more in the marketing, printing, computing and security industries,
according to the report by GAH Consultants, a media consultancy.
Projects funded by lottery revenue will also create thousands more jobs,
particularly in the construction industry, the report says.
Lottery revenue will pay for capital projects in the arts, heritage, and
sports sectors and projects for the millenium celebrations in 2000.
Overall the report, based on a survey of more than 30 national and state
lotteries, concludes that there is potential for a national lottery and the
football pools to co-exist.
However, it says that the pools sector could lose 17.5 per cent of its
revenue over three years and 1,100 jobs if it does not make changes in
management and marketing to meet the competition from the national lottery.
It says pools companies in other countries went out of business when faced
with a national lottery, but others had made changes and survived.
A summary of the findings has been made available to the Commons committee
looking into the national lottery by the National Heritage Department, but
the whole report has been kept confidential because it contains commercial
information.
The research shows that a national lottery would appeal throughout the UK,
to both sexes and to all socio-economic groups.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Sales of trucks and vans falter: Leyland Daf leaders January
market figures - Iveco concedes second place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY in commercial vehicle sales that began last autumn appears to
be running out of steam. On a year-on-year basis, total sales were up only
4.4 per cent in January. That compares with increases of nearly 8 per cent
in December and 15.25 per cent in November.
The figures reflect 'the continuing serious state of the commercial vehicle
industry which has been all-too-tragically demonstrated by events of the
past few days', according to Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society
of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, in a reference to the collapse of UK
truck market leader Leyland Daf.
The society's statistics show that sales of trucks over 3.5 tonnes were only
0.77 per cent higher last month than in the previous January, while sales of
heavy trucks over 15 tonnes were 5.43 per cent lower.
The irony of Leyland Daf's position - in receivership while being UK market
leader - was emphasised by its own 28.23 per cent sales rise in January
compared with a year ago, giving it a market share of 25.39 per cent.
The receivers warned yesterday they could shut the company if workers at
Leyland, Lancashire, strike today. Its rivals are preparing to capture any
vacated sales territory.
The Iveco group, which has been Leyland Daf's main rival, has taken out
full-page national newspaper advertisements stressing its Pounds 2.5bn
European investment programmes. The campaign is clearly intended as a public
statement of opposition to any government bail-out of Leyland Daf.
However, the group's move comes as it is being demoted from second place in
the market by Mercedes Benz. The German truckmaker achieved record UK sales
in January, capturing 21.47 per cent of the market.
The total number of sales in January of 17,418 compared with 16,677 in the
same month a year ago. Imports rose sharply to take 38.97 per cent of the
market compared with 36.82 per cent in the same month last year.
This increase was almost wholly accounted for by Vauxhall importing nearly
1,500 Astramax vans, production of which moved to Portugal last year.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Bid for Giroleasing 'was miscalculated'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Post Office almost signed an agreement with Norwich Union to sell
Girobank's leasing business for Pounds 19m too little because the insurance
company miscalculated its own bid by Pounds 55m, the National Audit Office
disclosed yester-day.
In its report on the sale of Girobank to the Alliance &amp; Leicester building
society in 1990, the public spending watchdog, said that the separate bid
for Giroleasing was only found to have been miscalculated the day before an
agreement was signed.
The office said that after making inquiries with Norwich Union about the
error it was satisfied 'that this was a genuine mistake'. It said the sale
would not have been allowed to proceed if the mistake had been found later.
After discounting the Pounds 55m error, Norwich Union's bid was worth Pounds
323m - or Pounds 19m less than another company had bid. Norwich Union
subsequently raised its bid to Pounds 342m.
Although Alliance &amp; Leicester was initially given two months exclusive
negotiating rights for the sale, this was eventually extended by a year
because of legal and regulatory difficulties.
During the delay, Girobank's investments fell in value, and the final sale
price was adjusted to Pounds 112m from Pounds 130m.

FT  12 FEB 93 / CBI urges boost for small businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry yesterday called for higher first-year
capital allowances and more generous corporation tax rules for smaller
businesses in its 10-point Budget submission.
The programme would cost between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn in a full
financial year, but Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, argued yesterday
that the boost to small businesses would lead to higher tax revenues in the
longer term.
The main elements of the CBI's proposals are:
Permission for smaller companies to write off up to Pounds 200,000 of plant
and machinery investment, or 40 per cent of capital investments, whichever
is the greater, in the first year.
Raising thresholds of corporation tax. The lower threshold, below which
companies pay 25 per cent, should increase from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds
400,000 and the higher threshold, below which companies pay 35 per cent,
should go up from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 2m.
Exempting business assets from capital-gains tax after seven years.
Tax relief for export promotion spending or increased government grants to
help with exports.
Deferring capital gains tax on the sale of unquoted equities provided the
proceeds are reinvested in unquoted companies.
Easing penalties for errors and delays in paying VAT. Punitive surcharges
for defaulters should be replaced with penalties closer to commercial rates
of interest.
The CBI said it was concerned at the proposed abolition of the Business
Expansion Scheme at the end of this year and intends to submit plans for a
possible replacement, Mr Davies said.

FT  12 FEB 93 / British motor sport goes west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK MOTOR racing industry, including component and accessory suppliers,
is to stage its first large commercial and technology exhibition in North
America.
It will take place in May at the Indianapolis 500, the US premier motor
race, with the backing of the Department of Trade and Industry and Society
of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
The venture was unveiled at the society's London headquarters on the eve of
a four-day motor sport show at Earls Court, west London. The exhibition of
cars includes the 1956 Osca Maserati.
It is aimed at making north Americans - 500,000 of whom will attend the
Indianapolis race - more aware of the dominance of the UK racing car
industry even in North America. At least 31 of the 33 cars entered for Indy
single-seater racing this year will be British-made, led by Lola Cars of
Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire.
'We believe it is time to build upon British supremacy in this area of
automotive technology and this exhibition is designed to open up new markets
for smaller UK businesses as well as the larger ones', said Mr Roger King,
the society's public affairs director.
The venture comes at a time of unprecedented interest in Indy car racing -
the North American equivalent of grand prix - because of the planned
participation in it during the coming season of British Grand Prix world
champion Nigel Mansell.
It may also serve to further the aim of motor sport authorities to bring
greater integration to North American and European forms of motor sport.
'Oval' racing as typified by the Indianapolis 500 is now confined almost
exclusively to North America.
However, East Northamptonshire council is considering a planning application
for a 1.5 mile oval circuit on a former steelmaking site at Corby. And
entrepreneur Mr Tom Wheatcroft, owner of the Donington Park circuit in
Leicestershire - scheduled to host this year's European Grand Prix - is
seeking planning permission for a new multi-million pound motor-sports
complex near Rugby, Northamptonshire, capable of hosting Indy races.
The moves comes, however, at a time of increasing divisions among commercial
sponsors, teams and motor sport authorities about what constitutes an
appropriate future for grand prix itself.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Manufacturers lift capital spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL spending by manufacturers rallied in the second half of last year,
according to government figures yesterday that will increase confidence
about growth prospects.
Investment in machinery, which accounts for about four-fifths of all capital
spending in the sector, held up particularly well.
It showed a small increase in the second half of last year, compared with
the first half and the final six months of 1991.
The provisional seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical
Office underline cautious optimism that the UK may be poised for recovery.
Manufacturing accounts for just under a quarter of the economy. Investment
by manufacturers on buildings, vehicles and machinery rose by a real,
inflation-adjusted 3.1 per cent in the final six months of 1992 compared
with the first half. At 1985 prices, the figure went up to Pounds 5.22bn
from Pounds 5.06bn.
Spending on machinery rose by 4.4 per cent between the first half and the
second half of 1992, from Pounds 4.24bn to Pounds 4.42bn. There was a
year-on-year rise in the second half of 2 per cent, from Pounds 4.34bn in
the final six months of 1991.
Last year total capital spending in manufacturing was 3.5 per cent down
compared with 1991.
In the second half, the figure fell 1.1 per cent in comparison with the
final half of 1991. Between 1990 and 1991, capital investment dropped by 9.4
per cent.
In the late 1980s, spending on plant, vehicles and construction by
manufacturers grew strongly, an important factor behind economic overheating
in the period.
In the fourth quarter of last year, capital spending increased by 0.6 per
cent on the previous quarter. It was 2 per cent down on the equivalent
period a year earlier.
The CSO said spending in the third quarter of last year increased by 1 per
cent on the second quarter, a higher figure than estimated.
UK borrowers announced new capital issues in January of Pounds 2.88bn, of
which Pounds 2bn was denominated in sterling, said the Bank of England.
Actual gross issues were Pounds 1.52bn, with redemptions accounting for
Pounds 427m, leaving net issues at Pounds 1.1bn.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Tough targets for job training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGH targets for placing long-term unemployed people into jobs or training
have been set by the government for its new jobplan workshops, Lisa Wood
writes.
The week-long workshops, which will be mandatory for people who have been
unemployed for 12 months and longer, will be able to recommend the
withdrawal of unemployment benefits for individuals who are unwilling to
participate.
Jobplan is part of the government's strategy for tackling the rise in
long-term unemployment.
Training and Enterprise Councils, which manage training programmes in
England and Wales, fear that the targets will result in the Employment
Service, which runs Jobplan, referring unsuitable candidates to the new
Training for Work Scheme. From April this will offer training and work
experience to the unemployed.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Serious economic risks in premature monetary union: Eddie
George Speech
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE George, deputy governor of the Bank of England who becomes governor
in July, yesterday made his first policy address since the announcement of
his promotion last month. In a speech at the DG Bank in Frankfurt, he said:
'The drama over sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism
left many people - both at home and abroad - with the impression that the UK
is still both soft on monetary discipline and lukewarm in its commitment to
Europe. I aim to persuade you that this impression is quite wrong on both
counts.
'Sterling's ERM suspension was the result of exceptional divergence between
the domestic policy needs in Germany and the UK. It had nothing to do with
the UK being soft on monetary discipline.
'When the break (with the ERM) came last September, people could be forgiven
for thinking that it represented a radical change in the objectives of
monetary policy. In reality, in this respect, the ERM was an important part
of the framework of monetary policy. The substance of policy had throughout
been, and remained, to achieve and maintain price stability in the medium
and longer term.
'I have no sympathy at all for those supposed pundits who continuously
complain that policy is obscure or even non-existent and that we are living
from hand-to-mouth.
'And I have no sympathy for those commentators who scrutinise the fine print
of every official statement trying to detect the most minute differences of
emphasis as between growth and stability from one day to the next.
'I do not know of anyone involved at any level in the process of monetary
policy decision-making or its implementation, who does not share the
conviction that price stability is a necessary precondition for sustainable
growth of output and employment.
'In fact, since we left the ERM, the aim of monetary policy has never in my
recollection been more clearly or precisely stated in the UK. The aim is, in
the chancellor's words, for 'a rate of inflation in the long term of 2 per
cent or less' and, for the remainder of the present parliament, 'to keep
underlying inflation within a range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent', and 'to be
in the lower part of that range by the end of the parliament'.
'Having a clear objective is not in itself enough, though it is not a bad
starting point. Confidence must be earned through deeds rather than words,
and I recognise that this will take time.
'In commenting on my own appointment as governor, the chancellor stated that
the new governor's central responsibility would be 'to support the
government in its determination to bring a lasting reduction in the rate of
inflation, the only sound basis on which sustainable growth and secure jobs
can be built'. We take both these responsibilities extremely seriously
within the Bank.
'Recent progress (in UK inflation) is especially encouraging in that it
reflects a very considerable improvement in domestic cost performance. Pay
settlements and average earnings are running at their lowest rates for some
25 years; and with productivity - especially manufacturing productivity -
improving over the past year faster than in earlier recessions, unit labour
costs, for so long the Achilles' heel of the British economy, have scarcely
risen at all in manufacturing in recent months. Recent cuts in interest
rates have been justified in terms of the government's immediate and
longer-term objectives for inflation.
'We took (sterling's recent depreciation) fully into account in reaching our
judgment about the appropriate policy stance.
'Depreciation, even if it proves to be temporary, is itself a source of
potential inflationary pressure, so that there can be no question of benign
neglect in relation to the exchange rate.
'But it is not the sole influence on inflation, and it need not threaten the
target for inflation, so long as domestic costs remain firmly under control
 -as, as I have explained, they currently are.
'And it may well be that sterling's recent fall will tend to reverse itself
as cyclical developments narrow the interest rate differential between the
UK and its continental partners.
'In this connection - on the basis of all the information currently
available to us - the government and the Bank are at one in seeing little
justification, and very little room, for further adjustment in our own
stance.
'The turbulence within the ERM over the past six months or so points up the
real dangers of moving ahead too quickly to a harder ERM, and beyond that,
to exchange rate fixity before adequate convergence has been achieved.
'We remain concerned that premature steps to monetary union would involve
serious economic risks. It is unlikely that sterling will rejoin the ERM in
the short-term until closer and more durable convergence between the
domestic policy needs in Germany and the United Kingdom has been
re-established.'

FT  12 FEB 93 / Clamping down hard on the clampers: Growing demands for the
government to curb car parking cowboys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Trevor Whitehouse's car was wheel-clamped, he cursed, paid the fine
 -and started his own wheel-clamping business.
Now the government is under pressure to curb Mr Whitehouse's activities,
along with the other 250 or so car-clamping contractors in Britain. New
research by the RAC, the motoring body, suggests that up to 250 companies
clamp 15,000 cars a week in Britain.
A government consultative paper is overdue, but is likely to appear before a
Commons debate next week on a private member's bill to control clamping. The
delay may reflect the fact that the government is caught between public
outrage over the activities of 'cowboy' clampers, the desire of clamping
companies for some form of regulation and the concern of businesses to
safeguard their parking spaces.
Car clamping on the streets is licensed and controlled by the police, but on
private land the decision on whether to clamp and how large a 'fine' to
impose rests entirely with the landowner. Consequently, 'cowboy'
car-clamping on private land has triggered a stream of well-publicised
complaints over the past three years about aggressive tactics and high
fines.
Not only have release fees been as high as Pounds 240, but contractors - who
frequently work on a commission basis - have been known to clamp medical
vehicles, and even a visiting police car.
The government has to balance this outrage against the fears of parking
space owners that their valuable parking spaces are being used by motorists.
Many businesses - including law firms and retailers - as well as public
buildings such as hospitals, use clamping contractors to safeguard their
carparks.
'It's politically difficult and embarrassing for the government, because it
cuts across so many grey areas,' says Mr Edmund King, campaigns manager of
the RAC. 'At the moment anyone can set themselves up as a wheelclamper - all
they need is a couple of clamps, and they charge what they like,' Mr King
said.
In Scotland, private clamping is in effect illegal - the Justiciary Appeal
Court in Edinburgh ruled last June that clamping a vehicle and then charging
for releasing it was equivalent to 'extortion and theft'. There have been
calls for the law in England to be brought into line. 'We are begining to
think there isn't any option,' says Mr John Spellar, Labour MP and author of
the bill.
A complete ban would not be acceptable to businesses that use clamping. 'We
need car clamping to protect our revenue. It's a legitimate weapon in the
fight against illegal parking,' says British Rail.
One of BR's contractors says sales of parking tickets have increased 30 per
cent since clamping was introduced at stations. The Home Office suggested
illegal parking be covered by the criminal law of trespass. Mr Spellar
suggests that another solution would be to extend the powers of the police
and traffic wardens on to private property.
But since these options could be legally complex, the Home Office is
understood to favour a third idea; introducing regulations that would allow
bona fide institutions to hire wheelclampers, but prevent private landowners
from profiteering.
'The complaint is not about wheelclamping per se - it's about the way that
some people go about it,' the Home Office said.
Many clamping contractors, nervous about losing lucrative business if a
total ban were applied, say they welcome government guidance. 'I would be
all for regulation. The law is so vague,' says Mr Tony Philips, owner of the
Southern Car Clamping company, who says regulation would drive out the
cowboys. His small company, which started three years ago, makes Pounds
60,000 a year on 70 sites. He boasts of the time his company once clamped 27
cars on a street.
The RAC says enforcing controls could be costly and bureaucratic.
Furthermore, discriminating against small-scale landowners is no guarantee
of good conduct - many of the clamping cases the RAC and AA have pursued in
court have involved companies working for hospitals and local authorities.
So far these court cases have proved inconclusive. Most companies settle out
of court, or they vanish when faced with charges. Meanwhile, the clamping
companies appear to be thriving.
Mr Whitehouse says profits can be made not only from fines but also from
renting out warning signs. His Preston-based company, National Clamps,
counts the BBC, British Telecom and several large retailers among its
clients.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Treasury rules on a tax bill fit for a Queen: John Authers
and Scheherazade Daneshkhu examine the taxable status of the royal holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS, SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU, ANTONY THORNCROFT and ANDREW
JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGREEING the Queen's tax bill has not been easy, the Treasury and Buckingham
Palace admitted yesterday.
Two decisions had to be made when setting the amount that the Queen will
have to pay - how much of her wealth would be liable to tax, and which taxes
would be levied on them.
The Queen will only pay tax on her personal income - the palace has gone to
some lengths to separate this fund from income received in her capacity as
sovereign.
For example, the royal art collection will from April 1 be owned by a
charity to be called the Royal Collection Trust.
All income from the civil list, set by parliament and paid by the Treasury,
and all grant-in-aid for the royal palaces, paid annually to the Royal
Household by the Department of National Heritage, will not be liable to tax.
This division is regarded as fair by Mr Richard Lees-Pulley, partner at
accountants Ernst &amp; Young. 'After all, employees get deductions for money
expended for business purposes.'
Another source of income, apart from the Queen's personal wealth, is the
privy purse, which derives most of its revenue from the Duchy of Lancaster.
Its surplus in the year to September 1992 was Pounds 3.6m. Its main purpose
is to meet official expenditure not covered by the civil list, but part of
it is used for private expenditure.
Finally, there is the Queen's personal portfolio of investments. The palace
refused to give any indication of its value, beyond saying that an estimate
of Pounds 100m was 'grossly overstated'.
Income and capital gains tax will be paid in the normal way, subject to a
deduction to cover the official expenditure made by the privy purse. In both
cases this is likely to mean payments at the top rate of 40 per cent.
'I'm surprised that the Queen has put herself into the position of many of
our wealthy clients,' said John Andrews of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'She has
thrown herself into the main tax net.'
However, others argue that since much of the Queen's wealth does not produce
income, the amount she will pay may not be substantial, particularly if she
avoids realising capital gains.
There are many ways in which she could reduce the amount of income on which
she would be taxed. Lees-Pulley suggests going into partnership with Prince
Philip to run her farms and borrowing a large amount to inject into the
partnership. Interest on the loan would be deductible against general
income.
The Queen presumably has no pension and she could make take the
tax-efficient step of making pension contributions, subject to an earnings
cap.
She will also be able to use the unique inheritance tax exemption given to
her as sovereign, in a significant concession made by the Treasury.
This allows her to leave an unlimted amount to her successor - including the
private palaces and entire investment portfolio.
But the Queen and all the royal family are liable to council tax and VAT in
the usual way.
One accountant from a large City firm said the inheritance tax concession
was not startling. Under current rules, business and agricultural property
are effectively exempt from inheritance tax. If being sovereign is regarded
as a business, the inheritance tax exception is similar to the current
rules.
This particular inheritance tax rule however applies only to sovereigns.
Thus, if the Prince of Wales were to die without ascending to the throne,
his estate would be liable to full inheritance tax. If he does become king,
he will be able to make bequests to the next sovereign free of inheritance
tax.
The reasoning behind this concession shows the difficulty in separating the
monarch's official and private lives.
According to a report by the royal trustees, the inheritance tax concession
was allowed because, 'the monarchy as an institution needs sufficient
private resources to enable it to continue to perform its traditional role
in national life, and to have a degree of financial independence from the
government of the day.'
Antony Thorncroft writes: the Royal Collection Trust, which is to be set up
to conserve and exhibit the Queens's pictures, will take possession of the
finest family art collection in the world. It contains 7,000 oil paintings,
30,000 drawings and watercolours, and 1,000 miniatures.
Most of the great names among the Old Masters are in the collection, which
was mainly assembled by King George III, King George IV and Queen Victoria.
The Queen has been generous with loans from the collection, and part of it
is always on view at the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace.
                             *      *      *
THE Queen's income tax return will almost certainly be scrutinised by Inland
Revenue officials housed in a drab post-war building in south Wales, Andrew
Jack writes.
Until last week, when it was acknowledged in a Commons written answer, the
Revenue had refused to admit the existence of the Public Departments
building at Tyglas Road in Llanishen, a suburb of Cardiff.
About a dozen so-called Public Departments are based in different parts of
the complex, which deal with the taxes of civil servants, members of the
armed forces and other public employees.
A VIP unit in Public Department 1 deals with the tax affairs of politicians,
members of the security services and other prominent officials, including
members of the royal family who pay tax. Revenue officials and members of
the Royal Household refused to give details about how much tax the Queen and
the Prince of Wales might pay, arguing that they will be entitled to the
same privacy as other taxpayers.
But the memorandum of understanding for royal taxation released yesterday
shows that they will be subject to interest on any late payments of tax - as
well as refunds if they overpay.
Final details of what financial information the Queen sends to the Revenue
have yet to be determined.
The compilation of the figures will be conducted by the finance and property
services division of the Royal Household. This is headed by Mr Michael Peat,
a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, who was made auditor of the privy purse in
1990, a post held by his family for four generations.

PT Gunawan Dianjaya, a family-run steel producer.
According to the Glagow Herald newspaper a team of experts from Gunawan
visited Ravenscraig recently, and a report is being studied at the company's
headquarters in Surabaya, eastern Indonesia. British Steel yesterday
confirmed it was holding talks with Gunawan but stressed that any agreement
could be months away.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Revenue unveils redesigned forms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 8m taxpayers, with the Queen possibly among them, will receive a
re-designed income tax form in time for the end of the tax year in April.
The form is being circulated by the Inland Revenue to professional tax
advisers and companies which prepare tax software.
The aim of the redesigned form is to make it much simpler to read and
complete, and to reduce the cost of dealing with incorrectly completed
returns.
Printed over 12 pages in blue and light orange on white paper, the new tax
return follows a structured format with instructions down the left-hand
margin and space for numerical totals down the right-hand side to lead the
taxpayer logically through the form.
There are eight variations on the basic personal income tax form, with
special versions for some taxpayers such as the clergy, underwriters at the
Lloyd's of London insurance market, members of the armed forces and British
residents overseas.
In all of the new forms the language has been simplified, the volume of
notes has been increased, and the questions follow a consistent sequence.
However, the new design has not been achieved without controversy. There
have been internal debates within the Revenue about the format, and some
accountants have complained that they were not given sufficient time to
comment.
And at least one software company has expressed concern at how easy it will
be for taxpayers to understand the instructions.
The new tax return document is part of a wider redesign of about 800 Revenue
documents and forms.
The Revenue hopes to introduce up to another 40 types of form by the start
of the new tax year.
The redesign project is being supervised by Wolff Olins, the design and
corporate identity consultancy.

SOUTH-EAST Asia displaced North America last year as the prime area for
South Korean direct investment abroad, as trade patterns changed, John
Burton writes from Seoul.
Korean investment in South-East Asia grew 29 per cent to Dollars 555.7m
(Pounds 368m), which accounted for 44 per cent of Dollars 1.26bn that Korean
companies invested overseas last year, the finance ministry said.
Investors were attracted by the area's expanding markets and its production
costs, which are lower than in Korea.
Meanwhile, Korean investment in North America, its biggest export market,
fell 16 per cent to Dollars 391.6m as its share of Korea's trade shrank
slightly.
The biggest jump in investment was in China, Vietnam and former communist
countries, with which Korea has established diplomatic relations in recent
years.

THE US Commerce Department yesterday levied duties of almost 70 per cent on
steel rail found to have been 'dumped' by British Steel and other UK
companies into the US market.
However, before the duties are made permanent, the International Trade
Commission must determine that dumping - selling at less than either the
cost of production or the product's cost in a third market - has injured US
companies. The injury test is more difficult to prove than dumping.
The steel rail complaint was filed by a division of Bethlehem Steel and CF&amp;I
Steel.
US imports of steel rail from the UK totalled Dollars 16.2m (Pounds 10.7m)
in 1991.

FT  12 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Brittan brings trade policy charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, yesterday opened legal
proceedings against three of the Community's most liberal traders - Britain,
the Netherlands and Germany - for undermining a common trade policy.
The announcement was condemned by British and German officials in Brussels
as 'astonishing' and 'ridiculous', and attacked as a thinly veiled attempt
to push through controversial Commission proposals to accelerate EC
anti-dumping procedure.
Sir Leon believes the countries have broken EC law by taking unilateral
action to abolish or extend national quotas on goods from 'state trading
countries' - China, Vietnam and North Korea. Existing quotas expired when
the single market began on January 1, and Sir Leon claims member states
should have asked for Brussels' permission to extend or abolish them. The
products affected include shoes, gloves, toys and crockery.
Formal letters of complaint will now be sent and if the Commission is not
satisfied with the replies it could eventually take the countries to the
European Court of Justice.
The harmonisation of quotas is linked to anti-dumping proposals which
Britain, Germany and the Netherlands claim will give Brussels too much
control over the EC's arsenal of trade weapons. The Commission says it
cannot separate the quota problem from its proposals on trade weapons,
because southern member states such as France will not agree to harmonise or
abolish import restrictions unless anti-dumping procedure is speeded.
'If you talk to importers around the Community, they are in complete
confusion about who they answer to and what they are meant to do,' said Sir
Leon's spokesman yesterday. 'The risk is that by renationalising quotas they
are undermining the single market: one country which might like to maintain
limits on imports cannot because another has (unilaterally) opened its
borders.'
But British diplomats yesterday blamed the Commission for not coming up with
an alternative interim strategy. 'We think (the Commission) is wrong legally
and wrong politically,' said one.
Both Britain and the Netherlands have extended last year's quotas until the
end of March, while Germany has gone for full liberalisation, abolishing its
remaining restrictions. Denmark, Italy and Greece have all sought Commission
authorisation for interim measures.

FT  12 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Investment pours back into Latin America:
It may be a mixed blessing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICAN countries crippled by the burden of debt repayment throughout
the 1980s have seen a reversal in the past two years as private investors
have poured funds into the region. From net outflows of more than Dollars
13bn (Pounds 8.6bn) in 1990, they recorded net inflows of almost Dollars
26bn last year.
While Mexico's modest net inflow of Dollars 3.8bn in 1990 has soared to
Dollars 15.3bn, Argentina has seen a net outflow of Dollars 4.9bn
transformed into an inflow of more than Dollars 5bn. Venezuela, which
haemorrhaged Dollars 4.2bn in 1990, saw net inflows of Dollars 344m last
year. Even the region's biggest debtor, Brazil, has seen an outflow of
Dollars 7.4bn in 1990 turn into an inflow of Dollars 1.4bn last year.
This striking turnaround, described by World Bank and United Nations
economists at this week's conference of the London-based Overseas
Development Institute on economic prospects for developing countries,
provided an important signpost for the 1990s: it is set to be 'the decade of
equity investment' in developing countries. Those which hope to improve
their plight must capture equity flows - whether in the form of foreign
direct investment, bond issues, or portfolio equity investment - or
flounder.
While the change of the past two years has helped the liberalising states
finance a surge in imports, World Bank officials argue it is a mixed
blessing: private investment, particularly portfolio investment, is
notoriously volatile. Also, as the countries of the industrial north rise
from recession, the present tidal flow of funds could swiftly reverse as US,
European or Japanese companies seek finance.
But its potential benefits are great: it brings new technologies, management
knowhow, and training for workers, boosts export capacity and provides
access to export markets. Portfolio investment can lower the cost local
companies face in raising capital.
Whether the improvement of the past two years can be sustained remains
uncertain, particularly in Latin America, where economists say the inflows
may be a 'windfall' consequence of recent economic liberalisation.
According to Mr Zigo Vodusek, economist at the Inter-American Development
Bank, they have been critical in enabling countries in the region to pay
interest on debts totalling Dollars 450bn. As debt service accounts for 20
per cent of export earnings, countries face a balance of payments problem
that is likely to grow until exports rally, or imports fall.
Mexico, for example, ran a deficit on visible trade in 1992 of Dollars 19bn.
Since net investment inflows totalled Dollars 23bn last year, breaching such
a trade gap was manageable. But even a small decline would create immense
balance of payments pressure.
Because traditional sources of finance from aid agencies or commercial banks
are expected to stagnate as banks struggle with new capital adequacy rules
and aid fatigue deepens among national governments, efforts to stimulate
private investment flows are likely to be critical.
According to Mr Kwang Jun, a senior World Bank financial economist, private
funds can provide a rich seam for developing countries. Institutional funds
available for portfolio investment in the US alone amount to Dollars
5,000bn-Dollars 6,000bn. At the same time, developing countries have far to
go in exploiting stock market funding. Mr Jun notes that developing
countries account for 13 per cent of world GNP, but just 6 per cent of world
stock market capitalisation.
Foreign direct investment currently accounts for just 2-4 per cent of gross
domestic investment in the developing world. But in Malaysia, where foreign
investment has been strongly encouraged, the figure is 20 per cent. Mr Jun
notes that raising the average to just 10 per cent could mobilise around
Dollars 50bn a year.
Bonds may provide another rich source of funds. Well below Dollars 6bn a
year between 1986 and 1990, they soared to Dollars 15bn in 1992, according
to Mr Cristian Ossa at the UN Department of Economic and Social Development.
He predicts bond issues will grow by 10 per cent a year in the near future.
Economists are more confident over Asia's prospects. Most investment flows
are now generated within the region, with one-time consumers of investment
like Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore now joining Japan to
become important net investors across the region.
Gloom is strongest in sub-Saharan Africa, where aid flows account for 11 per
cent of the region's GNP and almost 100 per cent of foreign cash flows. The
region's capacity to attract private funds is seen as limited, reinforcing
other pessimistic forecasts for prospects in the 1990s.

SOUTH-EAST Asia displaced North America last year as the prime area for
South Korean direct investment abroad, mirroring changes in trade patterns,
John Burton writes from Seoul.
Korean investment in South-East Asia grew by 29 per cent to Dollars 555.7m
(Pounds 368m), which accounted for 44 per cent of Dollars 1.26bn that Korean
companies invested overseas last year, according to the finance ministry.
It was the first time in 11 years that South-East Asia was the favourite
region for Korean investors, who were attracted by the area's expanding
markets and its production costs, which are lower than in Korea.
Meanwhile, Korean investment in North America, its biggest export market,
fell 16 per cent to Dollars 391.6m as its share of Korea's trade shrank
slightly.
However, the biggest jump in investment growth occurred among the current
and former communist countries, with which Korea has established diplomatic
relations in recent years. Investment in these countries climbed by 174 per
cent to Dollars 174.4m, from Dollars 63.7m in 1991.
The sizeable increase was due to rapidly expanding investments in China,
following the establishment of diplomatic ties last August. China
investments rose to Dollars 141m (Dollars 42.5m in 1991) and it attracted
the largest number of new investments - 171 projects out of 500 by Korean
companies last year.
In addition, investment in Hong Kong rose to Dollars 43.9m from Dollars 13m.
But investments in the former Soviet Union dropped to Dollars 4.2m from
Dollars 17.8m the previous year,in spite of a visit by Russian President
Boris Yeltsin to Seoul last autumn to solicit support for his country.
Korean companies instead preferred to invest in China and Vietnam, which
received Dollars 16.8m.
Western Europe was another area for sharp growth in Korean investment, with
a 56 per cent rise to Dollars 144.3m.
The former Czechoslovakia and Hungary were the main beneficiaries of Korean
investment in eastern Europe, with amounts of Dollars 6.1m and Dollars 4.2m
respectively. Investments in Latin America fell by 13 per cent to Dollars
36m.

   NICOSIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN for Cyprus to help develop the Krasnodar region of Russia, on the
Black Sea, is an unprecedented challenge for the growing number of Greek
Cypriot companies working in former Soviet-bloc countries.
A joint Russian-Cypriot development agency should be operating by summer in
Krasnodar, capital of a territory with 4.8m people. The area includes
Novorossysk, largest Russian port on the Black Sea, and the tourist centre
of Sochi.
Mr George Vassiliou, the Cyprus president, who speaks Russian and is backed
by the island's strong Communist party, suggested the project to former
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev more than five years ago.
Mr Vassiliou, once a marketing and management consultant, believes an
agreement signed last October with President Boris Yeltsin can provide a
secure framework for long-term trade and foreign investment.
'The most frustrating thing for a foreign businessman in Moscow is the maze
of bureaucracy, itself not certain what it can do,' he says. 'Under this
arrangement, Cyprus will support the local government in Krasnodar with
approval from the centre. It will be possible to avoid Moscow.'
Greek Cypriot consultants will set up a legal framework for foreign
investment in Krasnodar, organise training for local officials and make
economic and feasibility studies for development projects. The agency will
have a branch office in Cyprus, financed by the Cypriot government.
Greek Cypriot companies already have a lot of trading experience in eastern
Europe. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Greek Cypriot lawyers and
accountants have been helping Russian clients set up offshore companies on
Cyprus.
Greek Cypriot travel companies are already showing interest in developing
tourism in Krasnodar. But Mr Vassiliou's larger purpose is for Cyprus to
become a gateway for west European and US investors in south Russia.
Next month, the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority (CYTA), the state
telecoms monopoly, will open a satellite phone link with Moscow as the first
stage in improving communications with Krasnodar.
Under CYTA's agreement with the Space Research Institute in Moscow and
Astra, a state-owned company that has taken over a former military
telecommunications satellite, 60 international lines will be added to the
Russian network, to be routed through an earth station on Cyprus.
'This may not sound like a big step forward until you consider that the
whole of the former Soviet Union may have had fewer than 1,000 international
lines - compared with 2,000 on Cyprus,' says Mr Adam Kritiotis, CYTA
assistant general manager.
Russia's communications ministry has decided Cyprus is to be one of two big
'teleports' linking it with the rest of the world. By the time the
development agency is set up, Krasnodar will be one of a dozen Russian
cities whose international connections pass through the Astra satellite and
the Cyprus earth stattion.
In the next three years, CYTA plans to reinforce the satellite link with
Russia through a Dollars 25m project to lay a submarine cable to Krasnodar
across the Black Sea from Bulgaria. The connection with Cyprus would be made
through an existing fibre-optic cable network across Bulgaria and a
submarine cable from Greece.

BESET by violence, low academic achievements and fierce budget cuts, Los
Angeles schools now face a possible teachers' strike, unless last-minute
mediation produces a settlement.
Teachers have voted to strike in two weeks time, after the school board had
responded to the worst financial crisis in its history by slashing nearly
Dollars 200m (Pounds 140m) from salaries.
The impending stoppage is one more challenge for the embattled Los Angeles
schools. They are called on to provide social services ranging well beyond
education, and carry the burden of a place in the front line in the city's
racial conflicts. This burden has worsened since six days of rioting last
year left 42 people dead and some 700 businesses burned or looted.
These tensions are now high again, as the city prepares for a second trial,
in a federal court this time, of the policemen accused of beating the black
motorist Mr Rodney King. It was their surprise acquittal, in a state court,
which set off the riots. Attention is also focused on the trial of youths
accused of having beaten Mr Reginald Denny, a truck driver, during the
riots.
The unified school district, spreading far beyond the city of Los Angeles,
is one of the largest and most diverse in the US, with many of its 645,000
students living below the poverty line and a high proportion from recent
immigrant families whose English is weak.
Politicians from the San Fernando valley, north-west of Los Angeles city,
are now backing a plan to break up the school system to create smaller
districts more responsive to local needs.
A rival initiative, the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring
Now, countered this week with a proposal for massive decentralisation of the
school district's powers. Also, state schools throughout California could be
shaken up by a statewide proposition, to be put to a ballot next year, to
give parents vouchers they could use to pay for education in state or
private schools of their choice.

FT  12 FEB 93 / SEC's chief to step down early
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Breeden is to step down as chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission in the next two months, he said yesterday, ending a busy
and sometimes controversial three-year reign as the most powerful securities
regulator in the US.
Mr Breeden is leaving before his term's expiry in June. His resignation was
expected in the wake of the Democratic victory in the presidential election
last November.
A lawyer with strong Republican ties, he was appointed by President George
Bush in 1989. He had been on the White House staff and a key member of the
team that arranged the bail-out of the collapsed US savings and loan
industry.
A new chairman is likely to be appointed by President Bill Clinton in the
next few weeks.
The front-runners for the job are believed to be Ms Consuela Washington, now
securities counsel to the powerful House of Representatives energy and
commerce committee, and Mr James Cheek, a Tennessee securities lawyer backed
by Vice-President Al Gore.
Mr Breeden said yesterday there was no particular reason for his early
departure. 'It was simply time to go,' he said.
During his tenure as chairman, he broadened the agency's enforcement agenda,
sought to rid the securities industry of needless regulation, and promoted
improvements in corporate governance.
He also reformed the fast-growing mutual fund industry, eased restrictions
on capital-raising by small companies and earned a reputation as a tough
enforcer of the rules governing financial markets.
Mr Breeden also launched the Market 2000 study of equities trading, the
first big study of US markets in 20 years. It is due out this summer.
Mr Breeden did not escape criticism, particularly over his role in what was
seen as a politicisation of the normally independent SEC chairmanship.
He always denied he had aligned the agency's policy too closely with the
White House line.
He also clashed on various occasions with other US and international
regulatory agencies.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Clinton takes message straight to the people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF Mr Bill Clinton wanted to demonstrate that there are more ways of
communicating a message than via the Washington press corps, then his first
televised presidential 'town meeting' in Detroit on Wednesday night was, on
balance, a success.
The president made little hard news as such, beyond confirming such known
trends in his thinking as the likelihood of higher corporate and personal
income taxes for the more profitable and affluent.
Sacrifice, he argued, had to be shared fairly. The fact that he had
inherited a federal budget deficit Dollars 50bn (Pounds 35bn) higher than he
had been led to believe meant that sacrifice, in higher taxes and spending
cuts, was unavoidable.
But he again displayed his singular talent, much in evidence throughout the
election campaign last year and in the economic session at Little Rock in
December, for ex-plaining complex policy issues in easily understandable
terms.
The best example of this came when he was asked by a teenager suffering from
systemic lupus, a chronic ailment, how people with similar conditions could
be assured of acquiring the sort of long-term health insurance cover that
was being denied her.
Mr Clinton sympathetically answered that the key was the size of the
insurance pool. If small, like the 60 or so people in the TV studio, then it
only took one or two people with long-term illnesses to bankrupt the pool.
But, if the community pool was big enough, 'the risk of your care is spread
across large numbers of people and insurance companies make money the way
grocery stores do - a little bit of money on a lot of people instead of a
lot of money on a few people.'
Other presidents have used this folksy approach to good effect - notably
Franklin Roosevelt in his radio 'fireside chats' of the Depression era and
Ronald Reagan in his regular Saturday morning broadcasts, also on radio.
Mr Clinton is continuing the Reagan custom, as did President George Bush,
though to much less effect.
Intended to focus mostly on economic and related social policy issues - and
involving studio audiences in Detroit, Seattle, Atlanta and Miami  - the
town meeting covered much other ground, including the admission of
homosexuals to the US military and the latest US initiative in Bosnia.
However, the only question on the controversy of Mr Clinton's failure to
find an attorney-general came from one of the media interlocutors.
The media reviews yesterday morning were mixed-to-favourable. The Washington
Post said Mr Clinton had been put on the defensive by sharp general
questioning about his breaking of campaign promises ranging from
middle-class tax cuts to policy on Haiti.
But the New York Times found that he seemed at ease in the familiar format
and successfully got his key messages across. The Wall Street Journal said:
'With his strong presence, he appeared to be resuscitating his fortunes
after a period of heavy criticism.'
The Washington press corps is becoming agitated in that Mr Clinton has yet
to give a formal presidential press conference, though his staff insist,
with some justification, that there have been plenty of opportunities to
question him. It is a fair bet, however, that the town meeting format will
be used again and again.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Spending growth rate slows: Trend is still consistent with
solid US recovery
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATE of growth of US consumer spending slowed last month but remained
consistent with a solid economic recovery, figures from the Commerce
Department indicated yesterday.
After seasonal adjustment, retail sales grew 0.3 per cent last month and by
6.6 per cent in the year to January. Analysts had expected an increase of
about 0.5 per cent.
The increase was led by a 1.1 per cent monthly rise in sales of motor
vehicles and access-ories. Excluding vehicles, retail sales were up only 0.1
per cent.
However, few analysts expected the pre-Christmas surge in consumer spending
to be sustained. Yesterday's figures appeared consistent with projections of
real growth of consumer spending at an annual rate of perhaps 2.5 per cent
in the current quarter, down from 4.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of last
year.
Officials also announced substantial, but largely offsetting, revisions to
previous months' figures. December figures were revised down to show an
increase of 0.8 per cent over November rather than an increase of 1.2 per
cent reported earlier. However, November sales were revised up to show a
fall of 0.1 per cent rather than a fall of 0.5 per cent.
The net effect was to leave sales in the three months to January 7.2 per
cent higher than in the same period last year. The figures do not allow for
price inflation of about 3 per cent over the period.
Separate figures yesterday showed a 12,000 decline to 340,000 in claims for
state unemployment insurance in the week ending January 30, consistent with
a gradual improvement in employment prospects.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Cheque tax protest in Brazil: Business and unions united

THE powerful business community and trade unions of Sao Paulo state,
Brazil's industrial hub, yesterday began a campaign against a new tax that
is central to the government's fiscal reform.
The government hopes to raise the equivalent of Pounds 4.6bn through the
controversial 0.25 per cent tax on cheques, recently approved by the House
of Representatives and due to be voted on next Thursday by the Senate.
The honeymoon that President Itamar Franco has enjoyed since he took office
in December ended yesterday when some 50 leading business and union
organisations, with the mayor of Sao Paulo city, participated in a rally to
call for a nationwide protest movement. Demanding that the government sort
out its finances and crack down on evasion, rather than increase taxes, the
protestors called on the Senate to vote against the cheque tax and warned
that it could result in price increases of as much as 50 per cent.
Mr Carlos Eduardo Moreira, head of the Sao Paulo industries federation,
said: 'The new tax will not help anybody. It's time we did away with these
blood-sucking measures by Braslia that bring no benefits for society,'
The Sao Paulo rebellion is likely to have a considerable impact on the
Senate and comes as a blow for Mr Franco. The new tax is the main plank of
government strategy to plug a Dollars 13bn hole in the budget this year and
is seen as vital for a new Brazilian accord with the International Monetary
Fund.
Mr Franco said yesterday: 'I respect the right of anyone to demonstrate
against anything, including the tax. But I hope these businessmen will also
respect the right of society to protest against the high cost of living
caused by their outrageous prices.'

ISRAEL yesterday released without charge an American Palestinian after
complaints from Washington over his arrest with two other US citizens, whom
the authorities originally accused of being agents of the Hamas Islamic
fundamentalist movement in the occupied territories.
Mr Mohamed Hajjaj, a US citizen resident in the West Bank, was set free more
than two weeks after he was detained, as police decided there was no
evidence against him to back an indictment.
The US twice protested to the Israeli authorities over the treatment of Mr
Hajjaj and two other US citizens from Chicago, Mr Mohamed Salah and Mr
Mohamed Jarad. They were arrested amid allegations by Israel that much of
the organisation of Hamas had been switched from the West Bank and Gaza
Strip to the US. The allegations were made as Israel faced widespread
international condemnation over its expulsion of 400 alleged Hamas activists
to Lebanon.
The US was concerned that the three men had been publicly accused by Israel
of involvement in Hamas, including ferrying funds to its activists and
helping it reorganise following the deportations, without any formal charges
being laid against them. It also complained over the conditions of their
detention. Mr Salah and Mr Jarad are still under arrest but have not been
charged.
Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general, yesterday discussed the
Palestine deportees question with Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli prime
minister, and urged further measures to expedite their return, writes
Michael Littlejohns in New York. However, Mr Peres told reporters later that
the meeting had not constituted a negotiation. He dismissed the prospect of
sanctions against Israel by the UN security council, which the Arab states
are demanding.

FT  12 FEB 93 / China debates how to control boom: Beijing sees high growth
rates and investment as mixed blessings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S announcement this week that it was cracking down on the spread of
economic development zones is perhaps the clearest sign yet that the
leadership has resolved to restrain some of the country's wilder
entrepreneurial impulses.
But judging by the continuing debate in the Chinese press about the dangers
of economic overheating - scarcely a day passes without reference to the
problem - the leadership is far from a consensus on measures to cope with
China's booming economy, which registered double-digit growth last year.
Discussions on the subject among China's leaders appear to have been lively,
with reformists such as Zhu Rongji, the vice-premier in charge of the
economy, being accused by conservatives of possessing of a 'Great Leap
Forward mentality'.
This refers to China's disastrous attempt in the late 1950s to modernise its
economy overnight. In a speech reported this week, Zhu answered critics -
and at same time sought to reassure foreign investors who remain the key to
China's modernisation drive - by saying that the government was not about to
change course.
Among conservatives such as Li Peng, the prime minister, there is a feeling,
according to western economists, that the Chinese economy may have moved
beyond Beijing's ability to control it, without drastic measures that may
themselves bring chaos.
The growing independence of powerful economic regions, such as Guangdong
province in the south, is not the least of the constraints on the central
government's ability to curb activity.
The government's decision to freeze economic development zones, which enjoy
special privileges such as tax breaks, came in response to growing criticism
that it had lost control of licensing arrangements; and furthermore that
thousands of hectares of invaluable agricultural land were being
commandeered by those involved.
According to the English-language Business Weekly these zones had grown from
117 officially approved at the end of 1991 to some 2,000 - and possibly many
more - by the end of 1992. 'The State Council (cabinet) has announced it
will recommend imposing tighter controls over new economic development zones
in order to curb what has become a blind capital construction craze, ' the
paper said.
Burgeoning demand for building materials prompted a surge in prices last
year. Steel prices rose by some 15 per cent and cement by 14 per cent,
fuelled by the nationwide construction boom that saw imports of iron and
steel rise to 6m tonnes - double the figure for 1991.
Debate within the leadership about the mixed blessings of high growth rates
is almost certainly being sharpened by preparations for the forthcoming
National People's Congress, or parliamentary session, due in March, at which
economic targets will be unveiled for the coming year; not that planned
growth targets have counted for much in the past year or so. China's real
GNP grew by about 12 per cent in 1992, exceeding both the planned 6 per cent
and the 9 per cent average of the past 13 years.
Industrial output grew by nearly 20 per cent. Chinese leaders, including
both the cautious Li and Zhu, the reformer, have been talking of the need
for 'macro' steps to cool the economy, but neither has been very specific
about measures that might be adopted.
Towards the end of last year, it seemed that China was heading towards more
severe credit curbs - a first round of restrictions were issued last July -
but more recent signals from China's central bank governor indicated that
Beijing was not planning to embark on a tight monetary policy, for the time
being.
'The projected bank loans for this year are more than those of last year, so
by no means will we implement a tight monetary policy,' said Li Baoyuan,
head of the People's Bank.
Li added that credit growth planned for this year was 'proper and can back
the economy to continue developing in a rapid and sound manner'.
That may be so, but figures for 1992 reveal the real dimensions of the
challenge facing the central authorities in their efforts to pace the
economy in the face of an astonishing surge in new investment.
Fixed asset investment grew by about 30 per cent, bank lending increased by
around double the planned figure, money in circulation doubled, and the
broader measure of money supply (M2) charged ahead by 28 per cent.
Infrastructure deficiencies in the power and transport sector may in the end
prove the most effective break on frenzied development.
In the meantime, western economists are fairly sanguine about China's
ability to cope in the short-term with its extraordinary growth cycle while
resisting a resurgence of inflation.
The national living costs price index rose a relatively modest 6. 2 per cent
last year, although the rate was much higher, perhaps around 15 per cent, in
the larger coastal cities such as Guangzhou, Tianjin and Shanghai, which
have been the main centres of economic activity.
However, 'they are in waters no-one has ever swum in before', said one
economist. 'The International Monetary Fund doesn't know what China should
do. China has gone further in reforming a centrally planned economy than
anyone has before, and this has taken enormous economic and political
courage.'

THE Indian rupee yesterday fell to an all-time low on the foreign exchange
markets amid growing speculation that the government will announce this
month further liberalisation of the currency.
Bankers believe Mr Manmohan Singh, finance minister, will publish sweeping
new measures in his budget speech, due to be presented to parliament on
February 27.
The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, has done nothing to curb
speculation, which has grown in the last 10 days. Mr R Janakiraman, deputy
governor, yesterday declined to comment on the rupee's value.
However, dealers judged as significant the entry into the foreign exchange
markets of state-owned oil companies, which had obtained foreign currency at
preferential rates directly from the reserve bank.
The Indian currency has fallen 6 per cent against the US dollar this month
and it closed yesterday in Bombay at Rs33.44 to the dollar, its lowest ever.
Mr S Ananthakrishnan, executive director of the foreign exchange dealers'
association of India, said exporters had pulled out of the market in
anticipation of being able to change their foreign currency at better rates
in future, while importers were rushing to cover their requirements. The
rupee was falling so rapidly the market was 'illiquid', said Mr
Ananthakrishnan.
The rupee exchange rate was fixed until 1991 when the government of Mr P V
Narasimha Rao, prime minister, introduced partial flotation in wide-ranging
economic reforms. Exporters and others bringing foreign exchange into the
country were permitted to exchange 60 per cent of their remittances at free
market rates and the remaining 40 per cent at a fixed (low) rate of Rs26.20
to the dollar.
Bankers in Bombay believe the government could now either abolish the fixed
rate altogether or cut the 40 per cent requirement to 20 per cent or so.
This would act as an extra incentive to exports, which the government would
like to boost so as to aid economic growth.
The problem is that, until now, the foreign currency bought at cheap rates
by the reserve bank has been used by state-owned companies for the purchase
of key imports, including arms and fertilisers, as well as oil.
This has enabled the government to subsidise energy and fertiliser prices. A
move to free the rupee further would therefore either force the government
to cut subsidies or try to raise other funds from its meagre resources.
Finance ministry officials decline to comment on the budget's contents, but
it is widely expected in Delhi that there will be cuts in subsidies. The
budget is also expected to contain substantial reductions in import tariffs,
with the maximum normal rate of import duty coming down from 110 per cent,
perhaps to 70 per cent.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Australia hears of 1m reasons not to vote Labor: Keating's
hawkish campaign takes a knock from latest unemployment figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILIA TAGAZA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Australians were told by the official statistics bureau yesterday that
more than a million of them were unemployed last month, prime minister Paul
Keating found it difficult to sustain the hawkish tone with which he
launched his election campaign this week.
Seasonally adjusted, the January unemployment rate actually fell to 10.9 per
cent from December's 11.3 per cent. It was also the first time it had fallen
below 11 per cent since September last year.
However, the shock figure of 1,001,800 blurred the vaguely rosy picture. And
it was certainly no plus for Mr Keating in a campaign being run on economic
management and employment issues.
It was the highest figure since the great depression of the 1930s, and its
bitter aftertaste will linger throughout 1993, when the jobless rate is
widely expected to stay in double digits.
The jobs figure started the rollercoaster trail of the ruling Labor party's
election campaign. At kick-off on Monday the party rode high on a favourable
response to the business incentive package launched by Mr Keating. The
vote-buying package would have helped to steal some votes from small and
medium businesses who have previously supported the policies of the
conservative Liberal-National coalition.
He has dangled a substantial tax cut for companies: from 39 per cent to 33
per cent. He also offered a one-off 10 per cent investment allowance for
businesses buying plant and equipment.
The package would also have locked in some swinging voters among the
middle-class baby boomers. It promised a 30 per cent cash rebate for
work-related child care plus 150,000 new child-care places.
But the lustre of the package is slowly fading as the costs it would involve
emerge. Overall government spending will rise by ADollars 2.2bn (Pounds
980m) over three years, further worsening the budget deficit.
Already Mr Keating has acknowledged that the 1992-93 budget deficit will
reach ADollars 15.9bn, up from the original estimate of ADollars 13.4bn.
Gross domestic product growth expectations for 1992-93 have also been cut
from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent.
The business community has also pointedly claimed that Mr Keating's package
missed the important issue of industrial relations. The leading employer
groups, the Business Council of Australia, and the Australian Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, both said investment stimulation would require not
only tax cuts but quick changes to the country's labour relations system.
From the start Labor was on the defensive. When Mr Keating called the
surprisingly early election for March 13, the party was still licking its
wounds from its defeat in the state election in Western Australia. At the
same time the party was embarrassed when a high-ranking federal
parliamentary official, who is also a close 'mate' of Mr Keating, resigned
over a controversial ADollars 65,000 accident compensation payment.
However, Mr Keating is well known for his uncanny ability to turn political
adversity into advantage at the most unexpected moment.
The conservative opposition coalition needs only six more seats to win power
in its own right, five if the lone sitting independent MP is re-elected. At
the moment the 147 seats are divided among Labor (77), conservatives (68),
one independent and one vacant but previously occupied by an independent.
Five days into the five-week campaign, the conservatives are hammering the
theme '10 years of economic hardship under Labor is enough'. Now they say
there are a million reasons not to vote Labor.
But the conservative leader, Mr John Hewson, has yet to match Mr Keating's
policy promises. Mr Hewson has already said he would not match such an
'unfunded' package which left a gaping hole in the budget.
The conservatives are proposing a goods and services tax and cuts to
business taxes, such as payroll, wholesale and fuel taxes.
Introduced early last year, they have been well received by business. Even
more welcomed is Mr Hewson's industrial relations package, which would
reduce union power by allowing employers and employees to negotiate directly
over working conditions.
In an attempt to recover some of the working-class vote, Mr Hewson late last
year sweetened his proposals by exempting food from the goods and services
tax. He is expected to offer more sweeteners soon.
Campaign scores may change dramatically after an American-style television
debate between the two leaders on Sunday. Mr Keating can be expected to
unleash the power of his parliamentary debating skills.
A big advantage for Labor is the voters' natural fear of change. In Western
Australia's state election last week a discredited Labor state government,
widely expected to be humbled, was dealt a muted blow by an electorate
uncertain about the conservatives' radical industrial relations and tax
policies.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Delhi bans rally by BJP to avoid clashes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian government, which is struggling to restore political calm after
the recent inter-religious violence, yesterday banned a planned mass rally
by the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party.
The BJP, whose supporters sparked the unrest after they stormed the Ayodhya
mosque, replied by pledging to go ahead with the gathering on February 25.
The party claims the rally could attract 1m people.
The government's decision and the BJP's defiant response could raise
political tensions and undermine ministers' efforts to get over the Ayodhya
crisis.
Mr S B Chavan, home minister, said the BJP's demand for a rally was
'dangerous' and 'provocative' at a time of inter-religious tensions. The
party's failure to prevent the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque 'inspired
little confidence that the rally would be peaceful'. The BJP retorted by
condemning the government's 'fascist tendencies'. It said party leaders
would meet today to plan ways to continue with the rally. Party leaders may
go on hunger strike to gather public sympathy.
Later yesterday Mr Chavan extended the ban to all political rallies in the
capital for a few months.
The BJP's aim is to force the government to hold elections in the four
northern states where BJP governments were sacked, after the mosque was
stormed on December 6, and central rule was imposed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA'S hereditary sultans yesterday agreed to constitutional amendments
that will sharply curtail their legal immunity, AP reports from Kuala
Lumpur.
Their decision ended a month-long confrontation and helped avert a potential
constitutional crisis, the deputy prime minister, Mr Ghafar Baba, announced.
The deputy prime minister said that the rulers, who wield limited
constitutional powers, reversed an earlier rejection of the amendments and
accepted the legislation with some modifications.
Government officials said their acceptance means in effect that they could
now be prosecuted in court for assault, not paying debts and other offences.
The dispute between the government and the rulers had prompted a daily
barrage of commentary and articles in Malaysian newspapers.
Some of the articles revealed publicly for the first time the peccadillos of
the royal households.
The government also retaliated by systematically stripping members of the
royal families of privileges they enjoyed but which were not specifically
provided for in state legislation.
Uncertainty about the duration and political ramifications of the conflict
had dampened the sentiments of domestic investors in recent weeks, keeping
turnover at the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange relatively subdued.

<TEXT>
A consultancy which would assist in restructuring and privatising Chinese
state-owned industries is under discussion by the International Finance
Corporation, the World Bank arm specialising in private sector finance,
writes Alexander Nicoll. Sir William Ryrie, the IFC's executive
vice-president, said in London yesterday that it had been asked to study the
idea by Zhu Rongji, the vice-premier who oversees China's economic reform
programme. China's bloated and inefficient state-owned industries are a
serious obstacle to its drive for a market economy. The consultancy would
examine all issues connected with revitalising the industries, including
management, pricing policies and accounting. The IFC is discussing the
concept with western accounting and consulting firms.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Hong Kong fears interference by Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS by the agency of the Chinese government responsible for Hong Kong
affairs to participate in a locally based investment company have raised
fears in the colony about undue political interference in the operations of
Hong Kong's economy and financial markets.
Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) is the leader of a
group of mainland Chinese government bodies which may take up to 40 per cent
of the New China Group. The principal activities of this company are stock
brokerage, corporate finance and investment in mainland business ventures.
The company was formed late last year by a group of Hong Kong investors led
by Mr Tsui Tsin Tong, a businessman with long-standing mainland connections.
Other investors include Mr Li Ka Shing, one of the colony's wealthiest men,
Mr Cheng Yu Tung, chairman of New World, a property developer, Mr Stanley
Ho, Macao's gambling tycoon, and Singapore's Trade Development Board.
Chinese state and provincial companies have had a presence in Hong Kong
since the beginning of the 1980s, and their collective investment in the
colony is well in excess of USDollars 15bn (Pounds 9.9bn), but HKMAO's
involvement in New China is the first time an overtly political entity has
sought a business presence in Hong Kong.
'I think it is disgraceful,' said a Chinese merchant banker. 'This is a
political body which is responsible for Hong Kong affairs. The current Hong
Kong government has always kept out of business, except for regulation. This
is a dramatic change in the way things have been done; we feel that we no
longer have a level playing field.'
HKMAO is directly responsible for the negotiations governing Hong Kong's
transfer to China in 1997. Merchant bankers believe that HKMAO may be able,
or be seen, to trade on price sensitive information. Merchant bankers have
lobbied the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong's financial
watchdog, but it appears powerless to do anything.

BOSNIAN Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said last night he was leaving the US
and the latest Bosnian peace talks at the United Nations because Bosnia's
Moslem president has refused to attend the talks, Reuter reports. He said he
would return once all three parties - Serbs, Moslems and Croats - sat down
together to negotiate.
His announcement comes after Moslem forces launched an offensive to break
the 10-month Serbian siege of the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. UN troops took
to shelters but four French UN peacekeepers and two journalists were
injured. The airport was caught in crossfire and UN humanitarian aid flights
were suspended.

A SECOND big Czech company in less than a week has called for urgent
financial help from the government to overcome a financial crisis.
Poldi United Steelworks, which has already been forced to shut two large
plants and has reduced its workforce by half to about 10,000 during the past
two years, says it urgently needs 2bn crowns (Pounds 47.6m) to begin to pay
back debts totalling 5.1bn crowns.
Mr Karel Snabl, Poldi financial manager, wants a loan of 1bn crowns from the
government and says the company could raise another 1bn crowns through the
sale of property.
The crisis broke when the state-owned electricity utility reduced power
supplies to the company, which, it says, owes it 260m crowns.
Poldi itself is owed 2.8bn crowns by over 200 customers, including some of
the Czech republic's largest companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin last night met his arch rival, Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, chairman of the Russian parliament, in the first round of
bargaining towards a truce in their power struggle.
Mr Yeltsin suggested that he would press on with preparations for a
referendum on whether the president or parliament rules the country, just in
case the parliamentary speaker failed to keep his side of any bargain.
The stand-off over the referendum, which is opposed by Mr Khasbalatov, will
continue during two further meetings next week.
Mr Yeltsin may drop the referendum proposal if Mr Khasbulatov agrees to stop
trying to cut back Mr Yeltsin's powers until they are defined by a new
constitution.
'There are two options, either a referendum or a new agreement between (the
executive and the legislature) with strict guarantees,' he told a cabinet
meeting. 'To drop one or the other would be a big political mistake.'
While they met, a Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister,
called for a 'moratorium on inflationary actions' by the government,
parliament and central bank. The cabinet yesterday adopted an
anti-inflationary package, vowing to restrict money supply growth to 10 per
cent a month and inflation to 400 per cent a year.
He did not say whether it had the support of the central bank, which has
presided over very fast money supply growth over the past year.
Although Mr Yeltsin cited the ailing economy as the best reason for a deal
with Mr Khasbulatov, he has been driven into a corner over the poll by both
the parliament and the autonomous republics within the Russian Federation.
For a start, he cannot guarantee that a referendum would ask the question he
wants - do you support the president or the parliament? This is because a
compromise at the Congress of People's Deputies last December did not
specify what the poll would be about, and allowed both parliament and
president to submit alternative lists of questions to the electorate.
Parliament's constitutional committee has come up with a list of 11 obscure
questions on the details of a new constitution, while Mr Khasbulatov has
also proposed a 12th question on whether the electorate wants fresh
presidential and parliamentary elections.
A poll could also undermine the unity of the Russian Federation if leaders
of Tatarstan, Yakutia, and other semi-independent republics go through with
their threat to boycott the referendum. Some observers fear this could
accelerate a break-up of the federation.

FT  12 FEB 93 / US muscle for the mediators: American backing is a shot in
the arm for the Vance-Owen peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US endorsement of a negotiated rather than a military solution in Bosnia
might be seen by some as too timid an approach, but it has been greeted with
relief in the United Nations and by the international mediators.
Some of President Bill Clinton's election campaign ideas on the Bosnian
crisis, such as air strikes and the lifting of the arms embargo to help the
Moslems, have always been considered by the international mediators, Mr
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, as likely to exacerbate the conflict rather than
end it.
The emphasis placed by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, on
co-operation with Washington's traditional allies and Russia in the search
for a peace settlement, is seen as putting new life into the stalled
international negotiations. The US may continue to have doubts about the
mediators' plan for dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, but
it has clearly expressed its support for the Vance-Owen 'peace process'.
Full US participation in the process - through a competent and respected
envoy such as Mr Reginald Bartholomew and, not least, Mr Clinton's promise
that the US would join international measures to implement and enforce an
agreement endorsed by all the parties - provides the negotiators with the
kind of muscle they had conspicuously lacked.
Before an agreement can be enforced, however, it has to be reached. The US
administration, which has emphasised that it will not impose an agreement on
the warring parties, may have to shed more illusions when it comes face to
face with their slippery representatives.
The reason why Mr Vance and Lord Owen wanted the UN security council to
'impose' a solution was because all their immense efforts to reach a
diplomatic settlement in Geneva had run into the sand. They felt that only a
united security council, with the full backing of the US and Russia in
particular, would have sufficient clout to force the warring parties to sign
on the dotted line.
Such a procedure would not necessarily have entailed the use of force, but
it would probably have involved the threat of force.
Mr Bartholomew will find that the US will have to indulge in the kind of
arm-twisting undertaken by the mediators when they invited Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, the Serbian president, to Geneva in January. The strong-arm
tactics employed then by Mr Milosevic, to 'persuade' Mr Radovan Karadzic,
the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, to accept the mediators' constitutional
principles for Bosnia, may well have to be resorted to again.
If Mr Bartholomew's first stop since his appointment is Moscow, that is
precisely because the US administration is fully aware that Russian,
combined with Serbian, pressure could again shift Mr Karadzic from his
entrenched positions.
What is less clear is how much pressure the US is prepared to put on the
Bosnian Moslems, singled out by Mr Vance and Lord Owen as the chief obstacle
to progress during the New York round of negotiations, but whose interests
the US has vowed to defend.
That special concern for the Bosnian Moslems is understandable, given the
suffering they have endured at the hands of the Bosnian Serbs. But, from a
negotiating point of view, the lack of the same degree of impartiality as Mr
Vance and Lord Owen have shown throughout the long weeks of haggling between
the warring parties, may put the US representative at a disadvantage as a
mediator and could even undermine the whole process.
The US administration has also made much of the fact that it is not
producing its own map for the future ethnic division of Bosnia, mainly
because it considers the Vance-Owen map as partially 'rewarding' the Bosnian
Serbs for their policy of ethnic cleansing and because it does not believe
that it can be effectively implemented.
Since, however, the main dispute in the negotiations is about territory, the
US, too, will have to think in terms of maps sooner or later. The assumption
at the moment is that it will take the Vance-Owen map, which has already
been amended to take into account some of the Moslem demands, as the basis
for further negotiations.
Any attempt to abandon entirely the concept of a state divided into
semi-autonomous regions would be unacceptable to the Serbs, who have been
demanding an even greater degree of decentralisation, which would give them
virtual independence.
For a Bosnia peace settlement now to be reached, the three mediators will
have to maintain a united front and avoid giving the impression that they
favour one or the other party.

FT  12 FEB 93 / EBRD calls for scrapping of the rouble currency zone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday called on the
former Soviet republics to abandon the rouble currency zone.
Introducing the bank's first annual economic review, Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD
president, said establishing separate national currencies or smaller
currency zones could improve the prospects for production and trade among
the republics.
The bank, set up two years ago to help former communist states develop into
democratic and market-oriented states,said the rouble zone was already
crumbling. Ukraine and the Baltic states have left the zone, while Belarus
and Azerbaijan have issued coupons for most domestic cash transactions. The
review argued strongly that the remaining members should not try to keep the
zone together.
The EBRD said the rouble zone had been undermined by inadequate control of
credit and cash creation which had brought its members to the brink of
hyperinflation. The absence of co-operation between members of the zone had
also generated 'enormous pressure to restrict exports and capital outflows,
leading to near anarchy in trading arrangements.'
By contrast, the introduction of separate national currencies could improve
the prospects of production and trade. The EBRD suggested that some
republics, once outside the zone, would opt for more prudent fiscal and
monetary policies.
The EBRD's call reflects deep concern at the bank about the deterioration of
economic conditions in Russia and other republics. It estimates that real
gross domestic product declined by about 20 per cent in Russia last year
while inflation averaged 1,450 per cent. Elsewhere, output declined by
between 14 per cent (in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan) and 40 per cent (in
Armenia), with inflation ranging between 700 per cent in Latvia and
Uzbekistan and 1,600 per cent in the Ukraine.
The bank forecast that output in the republics would decline further this
year - although possibly at a slower rate - with the disintegration of old
economic links continuing to harm performance.
The bank is more upbeat about conditions in eastern and central Europe.
Output in the region declined last year by about 5 per cent with inflation
averaging 60 per cent.
The EBRD said the countries of central Europe 'seem poised for moderate
economic growth in 1993' and singled out Hungary and Poland as likely to
experience increases in gross domestic product.
Mr Attali said exports to the European Community from Hungary, Poland and
the Czech republic and Slovakia were rising strongly. In the final quarter
of last year, industrial production in Poland was 3 per cent higher than in
the previous three months and up 1.7 per cent and 1 per cent in Hungary and
the former Czechoslovakia.
He called for more open trade policies and lower interest rates in western
Europe to help eastern and central Europe overcome their economic problems.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Europe's car sales tumble in January
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR sales in western European plunged by 23 per cent last month compared
with a year earlier, according to industry estimates.
Four of the five leading volume markets were affected, led by a 53 per cent
drop in Spain. Germany, Europe's biggest, dropped by an estimated 28 per
cent to 238,000. France fell by 37 per cent to 113,000, and Italy by 14 per
cent to 202,000. The one exception was Britain, where new car registrations
rose 7.3 per cent, albeit from a very depressed level.
Otherwise, sales were higher in only three of the smaller markets: Norway,
Portugal and Ireland.
The scale of the fall will add to growing tensions between the European
Community and Japan over the level of Japanese car shipments this year.
Officials from the European Commission and the Japanese Ministry of
International Trade and Industry failed last week to agree a forecast for
the development of the EC car market in 1993.
The forecast is supposed to form the basis for Japan to 'monitor' its
exports to the EC under the terms of the 1991 understanding intended to
restrain Japanese exports during a seven-year transition period before the
EC new car market is opened completely to Japanese competition from the end
of 1999.
Earlier this week Mr Jorg Wenzel, head of the private office of Mr Martin
Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, urged Japan to cut car exports to the
EC this year to reflect the slump in the market, or risk provoking a crisis
in relations. The German car manufacturing and supply industry alone was
expected to lose up to 40,000 jobs this year.
Japanese registrations in January fell year-on-year by around 18 per cent
compared with the overall fall of 23 per cent, which boosted their total
west European share sales to 11.5 per cent from 10.7 per cent a year ago.
Carmakers fear a drop of 9-10 per cent in new car sales in west Europe this
year. The sharp January fall appears to reflect the special factors, which
inflated demand artificially in December and pulled sales forward from
January.

FT  12 FEB 93 / German steelworkers protest at further job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STEELWORKERS in east and west Germany took to the streets in protest
yesterday, as details of further job losses emerged from the country's
leading steelmakers.
Hoesch Stahl confirmed that one entire steel plant would have to be closed
down, with a loss of between 2,000 and 3,000 jobs, in order to reduce its
monthly capacity from 700,000 to between 550,000 and 570,000 tonnes.
A company spokesman said a decision would be taken by the joint board of the
newly merged Krupp-Hoesch combine, before the end of February, whether the
closure would be at Dortmund, the company's headquarters, or at its sister
plant in Duisburg-Rheinhausen, in the heart of the Ruhr industrial area.
Some 1,500 workers yesterday demonstrated outside the gates of the Krupp
steel plant at Hagen, near Dortmund, over the planned job cuts - which were
specifically excluded last year when Krupp launched its merger bid with
Hoesch.
In eastern Bavaria, some 2,000 steel workers occupied the railway station at
Sulzbach-Rosenberg, protesting at the loss of jobs at the ailing Maxhutte
steel plant.
In east Germany, some 3,500 workers at the Eko steel plant at
Eisenhuttenstadt are planning protests for today, while workers in the
Saarland have announced a mass demonstration for March 10.
The announcement by Hoesch that it will close a plant is the most dramatic
development in the German steel industry to date, although IG Metall, the
steel and engineering workers' union, estimates that 25,000 in the industry
will be threatened by capacity cuts.
Mr Viktor Braun, company spokesman, said that the merger with Krupp had not
been supposed to cause any job losses, but 'the situation in the market has
worsened dramatically since then. It is now worse than at any time since the
1970s.'
Preussag AG - the steel, trading, energy and metals group - said yesterday
that it would not be able to reduce any capacity, under the EC steel plan
proposed in Brussels this week, without causing a reduction in company
earnings.
Mr Ernst Pieper, chief executive, said the EC plan would not impose output
quotas for individual companies, but leave it to industry to divide the
cuts. He said steel production had fallen by 20 per cent in the first
quarter of the 1992-93 financial year.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Amato sets Italian central bank free
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINAL piece of legislation designed to make the Bank of Italy an
independent central bank has been approved by Mr Giuliano Amato's
government. The move will end the Treasury's ability to use the bank to fund
the budget deficit and is in line with the European Community's objectives
for monetary union. The legislation also allows the central bank to decide
the obligatory reserve requirements of the banking system.
The Treasury's account with the Bank of Italy had been intended to finance
day-to-day public spending needs. But, as Italy's public sector deficit grew
to more than 10 per cent of gross domestic product, the facility was
increasingly abused as a form of permanent short-term finance.
At the end of last year, the Treasury still owed L80,780bn (Pounds 36bn) to
the bank. This debt will now be converted into state paper and handed over
to the Bank of Italy. The Treasury will pay 1 per cent interest, the same as
it was paying on the overdraft.

FT  12 FEB 93 / CO2 emissions to exceed target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is likely to miss international targets for
stabilising carbon dioxide emissions by a margin of at least 4 per cent,
according to member countries' national plans submitted to the Commission.
A report circulating in the Commission shows the 12 EC members likely to
emit at least 2.878bn tonnes of CO in the year 2000, compared to about
2.775bn tonnes in 1990. The EC is committed by its own policy and
international agreements, to stabilise CO emissions, believed to be
implicated in global warming, at 1990 levels by 2000.
The Commission has been urging member countries to produce projections of
their emissions. According to the briefing paper, distributed in the
environment directorate, some have given targets for curbing emissions while
others have used forecasts based on national energy plans.
According to the paper, Germany, the largest emitter, has the most ambitious
plan - to cut emissions in 2005 to 75 per cent of 1987 levels. Denmark is
aiming to cut 20 per cent of 1988 emissions by 2005, and the Netherlands and
Belgium to cut about 5 per cent of 1990 levels by 2000. The UK, the second
largest emitter, is aiming to stabilise levels, as are France and Italy.
However, Greece and Spain expect a rise of at least 25 per cent this decade.
Portugal has the highest projected rises, of 29 and 39 per cent, depending
on economic growth.
Mr Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of
Energy, said yesterday: 'These figures show that more has to be done even if
countries stick to their national targets.'
The difference in projections between richer and poorer EC members has
caused tension over proposals for carbon and energy taxes, which poorer
countries feel should be aimed at the heaviest polluters.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Craxi leaves party but music had already stopped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN ironic turn of the wheel of fortune Mr Bettino Craxi last night agreed
to step down from the leadership of the Socialist party at a hotel within
500m of where in 1976 he was first elected to the post.
He took over a divided party and cleverly exploited its pivotal position in
Italian politics as an ally of the Christian Democrats throughout the 1980s.
But he now leaves a party rudderless, despised by the electorate and
internally demoralised by the cumulative blows of the year-old Milan
corruption scandal.
Mr Craxi himself has become the chief political victim of this scandal. He
has now received six warrants from magistrates warning him he is under
investigation for close to 50 instances of corruption and illicit party
funding from contract kick-backs. He was first urged to resign from the
party and make way for new blood after the Socialists' poor showing in the
April 4 general elections last year.
Fellow political veterans like Mr Giulio Andreotti, the Christian Democrat
and six times prime minister, and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the Christian Democrat
party secretary, saw the writing on the wall and stepped aside. However, Mr
Craxi obstinately clung to power and as the corruption scandal broke, he saw
this as a deliberate attempt to undermine him and his family. His
brother-in-law, Mr Paolo Pillitieri, a former Milan mayor, was one of those
charged with corruption early on in the investigation.
By refusing to resign, he increasingly split the party and identified it in
public eyes as the political grouping least capable of renewal. Thus in
hanging on so long, refusing to resign when receiving in December his first
warrant of investigation, he has merely brought increased discredit on the
party. His protests of innocence have gone unheard.
This behaviour and abrupt decline in his reputation has obscured his earlier
achievements. When he took over the party he saw the need to move to the
centre ground, distancing the party from the Marxist side of socialism. He
changed the party's symbol to a red carnation from the hammer and sickle. He
realised he could use the party's 12 per cent vote as a key to helping the
Christian Democrats stay in power.
With his strong personality (he was often accused of being a bully), he
managed to convince the Christian Democrats to allow him to become prime
minister in 1983. He was the first Socialist prime minister and the first
from Milan. He presided over a stable government lasting 1,058 days, the
longest in post-war history and a considerable achievement compared to the
average that lasted a fifth of this time. His other main achievement will be
regarded as initiating a process to cut indexed wages - the scala mobile.
But Mr Craxi will also be remembered for consolidating and expanding the
control of the ruling parties over the state apparatus. He permitted and
encouraged a systematic division of the spoils of office, placing his men in
key positions throughout the state apparatus. This meant that the benefits
of the economic boom of the 1980s were squandered, public spending was
allowed to grow unchecked and corruption thrived. It was precisely this
system, which began under his premiership and which continued until the end
of the last Andreotti government in April 1992, that lies behind his
downfall.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Delors attacks 'wildcat' devaluations: EC's floating
currencies accused of threatening the future of the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES DELORS, European Commission President, yesterday launched an
attack on 'wildcat' devaluations which were undermining confidence in the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Without naming the UK, Mr Delors said he believed that a system of
relatively fixed exchange rates - like the ERM - offered greater advantages
than floating exchange rates. Currencies which left the discipline of the
ERM and floated freely raised 'serious questions' about the future of the
European monetary system.
At a news conference in Brussels, Mr Delors stressed that there was nothing
wrong with realignments within the ERM, if there were fundamental economic
divergences between members. But it was important that adjustments were
carried out within the ERM in the presence of EC finance ministers, rather
than 'a wildcat act done at the drop of a hat'.
The European Commission president's comments underline lingering resentment
in Brussels over Britain's unilateral withdrawal of sterling from the ERM
during last September's currency crisis, and concern over the unsettling
effect of a floating pound on other currencies in the ERM.
However, Mr Delors declined to back charges in Bonn and Paris that
Anglo-Saxon financial institutions were engaged in a plot to undermine the
ERM and prevent the creation of a single European currency to rival the
dollar.
'I have no information, but that does not mean to say others have no
information. I cannot confirm or deny.' Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany
accused unnamed forces last week of seeking to 'torpedo' the EC's drive for
a monetary union by the end of the century by speculating against individual
currencies.
Mr Raymond Barre, former French finance minister, said last week that
certain people in economic and financial circles were determined to prevent
the creation of European economic and monetary union and 'blow up' the EMS.
Mr Delors said he had studied closely the recent turbulence in the currency
markets. His conclusion was that the ERM needed to be strengthened, and the
second stage of Emu leading to fixed exchange rates for currencies meeting
strict economic convergence criteria should be prepared very carefully. Mr
Delors again ruled out the option of a small group of strong currencies led
by France and Germany moving on a 'fast-track' to Emu outside the Maastricht
treaty. EC members agreed that the process including all 12 countries moving
together, he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Pierre Beregovoy, French prime minister, yesterday called for faster
progress to European monetary union.
This was essential to ensure that the maximum number of European countries
could subscribe to the union, though he recognised that accelerating the
process was probably not possible for the time being.
Mr Beregovoy's remarks - at a conference on Europe: the Way Forward, held by
the Financial Times and the French newspaper Les Echos - were contrasted
with the cautious step-by-step approach to monetary union advocated by Mr
Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, who recommended that the
timetable laid down in the Maastricht treaty should be strictly followed.
Mr Tietmeyer warned that any attempts to speed up European monetary union
would be 'dangerous'. It would be safer to wait until a first assessment of
the impact of the single European market and until the economic convergence
criteria detailed in the Maastricht treaty had been durably achieved, Mr
Tietmeyer said.
The timetable in the treaty - in three stages up to January 1999 at the
latest - was right, he said. The currency turmoil last autumn had underlined
the risk of following 'an illusory policy'.
The convergence criteria must be 'observed very closely' while the European
Community must make a political effort to head off the burdens created by
the end of governmental freedom to adjust individual exchange rates.
Mr Tietmeyer said the present exchange rate parities in the EMS were
sustainable and no upsets were expected this year. Imbalances in currency
patterns accumulated over years had been sorted out in the realignments
started with the currency crisis last September, so that the 'EMS has
survived and will survive on the basis of current exchange rate parities',
he said.
The Bundesbank vice-president paid tribute to the consensus among French
political leaders on the need to defend the franc and said he could only
encourage them to continue.
'The fundamental facts of the French economy are OK and, compared to my own
country, are better. The franc had saved itself, not just thanks to the
Bundesbank's support.'
His remarks are likely to comfort those in French political circles who
expect that the French and German central banks will have to beat off a
renewed assault on the franc about the time of French parliamentary
elections next month. Mr Tietmeyer saw no point in forming a separate
fixed-rate inner core of two or three strong currencies, the subject of
recent speculation in Paris and Brussels.
That 'would not be in line with the treaty', the spirit of which is that a
basis for monetary union must be laid for all EC members. 'Of course, it is
likely that, in the beginning, only some countries would be able to go,' he
added.
Mr Beregovoy also warned that the importance of social policies must not be
forgotten in the creation of the European single market. 'Europe should not
be only about competition and technocracy, it should also be about
solidarity,' he said, recalling Hoover's recent decision to close a vaccuum
cleaner plant near Dijon and shift to lower-cost production in Scotland.
The Hoover affair, which has been drawn into the French election campaign,
was also seized on by Mr Francois Perigot, president of the Patronat, the
French employers' organisation, who pointed out that French social charges
were so high that the US group could hardly be blamed for its move. He
warned that attempts to interfere with foreign investors' freedom to act
could harm France's chances of attracting more foreign investment.
France should continue its hard franc policy - 'a floating franc would be
catastrophic,' said Mr Perigot.
The EC had yet to reach the right balance between a firm application of
competition policy and the need to support important industries, said Mr
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, French minister for industry and foreign trade.
No major economy could maintain its position without a strong industrial
base, the minister said.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Dealers scare the D-Mark's Belgian shadow: What has brought
one of the ERM's hard-core currencies under pressure in the markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING the repeated attacks on the European exchange rate mechanism in
recent months, at least the system's 'hard core' seemed reasonably safe from
assault.
This week, however, it was the turn of the Belgian franc - which along with
the Dutch guilder has remained closest to the D-Mark in the last few years -
to feel the heat of currency strife.
Remarkably, the Belgian franc has sometimes been seen as a surrogate for the
D-Mark. In 1990 Belgium decided to tie its currency to the D-Mark at much
narrower fluctuation bands than the 2.25 per cent margin generally ruling in
the ERM.
This has enabled the Belgian state to borrow at interest rates close to
those on German government bonds - despite overall Belgian public sector
debt which, at more than 130 per cent of gross national product, is the
highest in the EC.
This week, however, confidence in the Belgian franc was undermined as doubts
about the country's political stability sparked concern among international
investors about its public finances.
One reason for the volatility was the Belgian National Bank's haste in
following last week's cut in the Bundesbank's discount and Lombard rates.
When the Bundesbank reduced its interest rates on February 4, the Belgian
central bank lowered its special advances rate - used in money market
operations - from 8.40 per cent to 8.30 per cent.
On Wednesday, the Belgian central bank was forced to reverse the effort to
cheapen credit. After a sharp rise in short-term interest rates and
government bond yields at the beginning of the week, the central bank
increased its end-of-day rate from 8.80 per cent to 9.30 per cent.
The difference between yields on 10-year Belgian government bonds and those
on ten-year German government bonds narrowed from 1.24 percentage points on
August 31 1992 to 0.40 of a point on January 8 this year. But during the
last few days the gap has widened to as much as 0.90 of a point.
'International investors simply decided the time had come to take profits,
as they couldn't see the yield spread narrowing any further,' says one bond
dealer.
The political worries relate to the constitutional reforms narrowly approved
by Belgium's parliament last Saturday. Belgian deputies approved the
fundamental part of a far-reaching reform programme which will turn Belgium
into a federal state and devolve further powers to its regions.
Belgian economic analysts believe that foreign worries that this could
weaken the authority of central government are overdone. They point out the
success of Belgium's fragile centre-left coalition in winning a two-thirds
majority in parliament over the issue.
However, international investors took a different view. Bond dealers in
London admit that hardly any foreign market operators have a detailed
understanding of the nature of the constitutional reforms. But the general
uncertainty has forced them to re-examine their Belgian government bond
holdings.
In particular, their attention was drawn to the link between slack Belgian
growth and its rising public deficit, which last year reached BFr485bn,
(Pounds 9.8bn), 6.9 per cent of GNP.
This is a particular handicap because of the stipulation in the Maastricht
treaty that EC members should reduce their deficit to 3 per cent of GNP as a
condition for joining economic and monetary union.
The Belgian government is trying to freeze public spending in real terms,
increase revenues through fiscal measures and modest privatisation, and
stabilise the generous social security budget.
Belgian economists seem puzzled by the new con-cerns about this old economic
phenomenon, and blame non-Belgian bond and currency traders.
'Of course the government debt is very large,' said Mr Lieven Noppe of
Kredietbank yesterday, 'but it's been that way for almost 10 years and
despite that the franc has managed to become a strong currency and interest
rate differentials (with Germany) have narrowed.'
Yesterday, Belgian analysts and the central bank seemed confident that the
attack had been seen off, with the franc returning to near-parity with the
D-Mark. But the Belgian government's policy of linking the franc to the
D-Mark has been sorely tested.
Mr Alfons Verplaetse, the central bank governor, said last week that the
bank would be prepared to allow the franc to fall as much as 0.30 per cent
below its ERM central rate again the D-Mark.
Mr Verplaetse underlined on Wednesday that he would take all possible
measures to support the franc. Aided by this pledge and the interest rate
increase, the currency steadied yesterday. But investors' confidence about
the Belgian franc's stability may take longer to return.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Road network sell-off proposed: Trunk route users could pay
tolls - New agency would control system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT plans to hive off Britain's 6,600-mile national road network
to an agency called Highways Command as a prelude to possible privatisation.
Tolls could be introduced on trunk roads as well as motorways to offset the
Pounds 2bn-a-year bill for road building and repairs.
Confirmation of the plan came with the publication of the Transport
Department's annual report yesterday, which lists Highways Command with some
smaller departmental activities as a candidate for agency status.
The new body would take responsibility for all Britain's trunk roads and
motorways. Although these account for only 4 per cent of the country's total
road length, with the rest owned by local authorities, they carry 32 per
cent of all traffic and 56 per cent of goods traffic.
At present all trunk roads and motorways are toll-free. However the
government has said that a green paper to be published this spring will
propose charges on these routes to help meet the cost of the road programme.
The strong cashflow from tolls would for the first time raise the
possibility of privatising the network, either through an outright sale or
through a form of franchising. Officials stress that the plans are at an
early stage and no timescale has been set.
News of the proposals comes days after the approval by the German ruling
coalition of plans to privatise its 7,000-mile autobahn network .
The plans have provoked a furore among German motorists because they would
be accompanied by the introduction of user fees which would be put towards
the cost of restructuring the heavily-indebted railways.
Although there are some privately-built toll roads in Europe, particularly
in France, no country has yet moved towards the privatisation of all or part
of its national road network.
Britain has recently taken hesitant steps towards encouraging the private
sector to design and build toll motorways, but so far these have made little
progress. Only one project, the Birmingham Northern Relief Road, has yet
been agreed and still has to go through the planning process.
Britain's road network will be the last significant part of the national
transport infrastructure to remain in state hands when the planned
privatisation of the railways is complete.
Critics of British transport policy have frequently suggested that the
Department of Transport is biased towards roads because this is the only
form of transport for which it retains executive responsibility.
With roads hived off to a separate executive agency, the Transport
Department's only remaining responsibility would be for the strategic
planning of the national road network.
There are already more than 80 executive agencies providing government
services such as the payment of benefits and vehicle licensing. Each is
headed by a chief executive who is given considerable freedom to manage the
agency within a framework of objectives set by the sponsoring department.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Clinton tax plan targets high executive pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton told business leaders at the White House yesterday
that he intends to propose not only increasing taxes on US corporations but
also penalising more extravagant executive salaries. It was time, he
declared, for 'you to do your part'. The night before Mr Clinton had flown
to Detroit on Air Force One (picture above) for his first televised
presidential 'town meeting', where he argued that sacrifice had to be shared
fairly. The president has often spoken of the need for shared sacrifice to
cut the federal budget deficit. He pointed yesterday to 'the enormously
increased rate of executive compensation'.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Bank chief warns against further cuts in rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A WARNING against further cuts in interest rates came yesterday from Mr
Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England who becomes governor in
July.
He also fired a shot in a war of words with the City by criticising
'supposed pundits' from financial markets who complained that UK monetary
policies lacked credibility.
In his first policy address since his promotion last month, Mr George set
out a wide-ranging view of how he intends to guide monetary policy with a
'total commitment' to price stability.
He poured scorn on suggestions that the Bank was at odds with ministers over
the correct way to lift the UK from recession and said that inflation was
under control.
Mr George also said a premature move to a single European currency and
central bank would involve 'serious economic risks' ahead of greater
convergence of economic conditions across the continent.
He said, in response to questions, it would be 'at least nine to 15 months'
before sterling rejoined the European exchange rate mechanism.
However, Mr George's robust speech in Frankfurt failed to lift the pound,
which after recent heavy selling remained weak last night. It also prompted
rejoinders from some City commentators who said his comments did little to
quell scepticism about how much the Treasury and Downing Street listened to
the Bank before setting interest rates.
Last night the pound closed in London against the D-Mark down 1 pfennig at
DM2.3525, close to its all-time low. Sterling also lost ground against the
dollar, closing down nearly 1 cent at Dollars 1.4185. In New York, it closed
at DM2.3520 and Dollars 1.4175.
Mr George's speech was designed to counter speculation about rifts in
policymaking, principally involving Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. Many in the markets believe Mr Major wants
to cut rates quickly to spur demand, with Mr Lamont and the Bank urging
caution because this could trigger inflation.
Mr George said the value of the pound would not be neglected. Since
sterling's departure from the ERM last September it has lost 15 per cent of
its value.
The 4-percentage point cut in interest rates since September to 6 per cent
was 'fully justified' by the need to boost demand but keep inflation low, he
said.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, said people should not
expect too much in the way of money-market interest rate cuts at present. He
said last week's Bundesbank cuts in the Lombard and discount rates did not
sound the all-clear for stability in Germany.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Queen will pay taxes on personal income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUEEN and the Prince of Wales are to pay tax on their personal income
'in the same way as every other taxpayer', Mr John Major announced
yesterday.
For the first time, the sovereign will also be liable for capital gains tax
and inheritance tax, with the important exception that inheritance tax will
not apply to the transfer of assets from the Queen to her successor.
The prime minister emphasised the move was at the Queen's initiative. It was
announced in principle in November after public unease over the cost and
behaviour of the royal family.
Lord Airlie, Lord Chamberlain and head of the Queen's household, said the
move would place a 'considerable additional burden' on the Queen's finances.
He said the Queen had acted to ensure the monarchy developed with the times,
particularly during a period of recession. The recent emphasis on royal
wealth had tended to obscure the Queen's contribution to national life, and
this - not the embarrassing publicity surrounding the Queen's children - had
prompted the change.
Commenting on estimates of her private funds ranging from Pounds 100m to
billions of pounds, Lord Airlie said: 'Her majesty has authorised me to say
that even the lowest of these estimates is grossly overstated.'
The prospect of a continental European-style monarchy appears to have
receded. Lord Airlie said the additional costs could 'be met without
compromising the standards and style which are expected of the Queen'. Tory
MPs urged that the change should not amount to a 'cut-price' sovereign.
The new arrangements, set out in a memorandum between the Queen and the
government, follow months of talks between the Treasury, the Inland Revenue
and the Royal Household.
In his Commons statement, Mr Major said the exact tax figures would be kept
secret, but tax would be levied initially at 25 per cent and later at 40 per
cent on the income the Queen used for private purposes.
The arrangements on inheritance tax disturbed some MPs. But Mr Major said
they were needed to protect the monarchy from the risk of the sovereign's
assets being 'salami-sliced' through successive generations.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Leyland Daf strike would force closure, say receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECEIVERS for Leyland Daf warned the company's 5,500 UK employees
yesterday that any industrial action to try to halt redundancies would force
the closure of the entire company.
Workers at the Leyland Daf plants in Lancashire, Glasgow, Oxfordshire and
Birmingham were balloted yesterday on possible strike action in a last-ditch
move by the unions to try to strengthen their ability to negotiate better
redundancy terms.
Mr Murdoch McKillop, one of the joint administrative receivers, warned in a
letter to all employees that the alternatives facing the company were
'either to save cost by actioning the redundancies or to close the whole
business down'.
The receivers said the workforce would be cut 'in the near future' by 30 per
cent across the company, implying the imminent loss of about 1,650 jobs.
Mr McKillop warned that 'if there is strike action then all 5,500 jobs with
Leyland Daf will most likely be lost, with a knock-on effect to suppliers'.
Leyland Daf is the UK subsidiary of Daf, the beleaguered Anglo-Dutch
commercial vehicle maker, which collapsed into receivership last week with
total debts of more than Fl 3bn (Pounds 1.1bn) and after running up losses
of more than Fl 800m in the past three years.
The company has a total workforce of 12,650, and the Dutch administrators
for Daf in the Netherlands warned earlier this week that more than half of
the 6,500 jobs in the Netherlands and in Belgium would have to be cut.
Workers at all the Leyland Daf plants agreed by substantial majorities at
mass meetings yesterday morning to hold immediate secret ballots to win
support for possible strike action against the company in a move to try to
strengthen the bargaining hand of the workforce in achieving better
redundancy terms.
The results of the ballots will be announced this afternoon.
The workforce is not expected to take strike action, but the unions have
been advised that once any workers have been made redundant they cannot
lawfully strike or pressurise the company in other ways.
Union leaders were aware after their talks with the receivers on Wednesday
that redundancies were imminent, and decided to take co-ordinated action in
a pre-emptive move to try to improve the redundancy terms of workers now
facing dismissal in the first wave of job cuts.
Mr Karel van Miert, the European commissioner for competition policy, said
yesterday the EC would investigate any government subsidies offered to bail
out Daf. He said the EC had approved state aid for the motor industry in the
past as long as the cash was matched by cuts in capacity.
He told the European parliament that his staff was monitoring plans to
salvage the core Daf truck operations in a new company, New Daf.
He also raised the possibility of giving aid from the EC Social Fund to help
alleviate the social consequences of Daf's collapse. 'The Commission can
intervene by means of the European Social Fund with measures designed to
help employment stability and to develop new employment possibilities,' he
said.
Union leaders pointed to the contrast between the cash compensation
redundant Daf workers will receive in the Netherlands and the amounts UK
workers can expect now that the company is in receivership.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: The flight into yen continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN came close to testing its all-time high against the US dollar
yesterday on speculation that finance ministers from Japan and the US would
discuss reducing the huge Japanese trade surplus this weekend, writes James
Blitz.
For the third day running, the yen gained new ground against most other
currencies in heavy trading. It closed at Y72.46 per D-Mark from a previous
Y73.00 on what one dealer described as the most turbulent day in his dealing
room this year.
Its performance against the dollar was even stronger, helped by lacklustre
US retail sales figures. The dollar closed in London at Y120.2, down from
Y120.9. At one stage it was as weak as Y119.5, near to the historic low of
Y119.0 set last year. It picked up in New York to end at Y121.2
The yen also continued its extraordinary performance against sterling,
ending at Y170.5 to the pound, up Y2, its third consecutive day of
registering an all-time high. For British importers of Japanese goods, the
exchange rate of Y234.25 recorded the day after the UK general election last
year must seem a world away.
The flurry of yen buying began after Mr Thomas Foley, the speaker of the
House of Representatives, said he thought that President Bill Clinton might
favour policies aimed at strengthening the Japanese currency.
US Treasury officials later played down the possibility that an accord on
reducing the Japanese trade deficit might be reached when Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
the US treasury secretary, meets the Japanese finance minister this weekend.
Mr Steven Hannah, a director of IBJ International in London, said the
current flight into the yen was similar to one which took place last year,
when words from politicians failed to be backed up by actions. 'There is
still a risk that interest rates in Japan can fall further,' he said,
believing that the current rally would be hard to sustain.
However, Mr Jeremy Hawkins, vice-president of Bank of America in London,
said the market could test the yen's record high against the dollar again.
'With the difficulties over the Gatt talks and the US embargo on steel
imports, trade issues are taking up an increasing amount of the market's
attention,' he added.
Trading inside the European exchange rate mechanism remained quiet and the
French franc finished at FFr3.379 against the D-Mark from a previous
FFr3.383. However, omens of tension continued to be seen in the background.
In Frankfurt, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, spoke in
favour of 'limiting to greater extent recourse to foreign currency market
intervention'.
In Paris, the Director of the French Bankers' Association said banks are now
losing FFr300m a month with base rates at 10 per cent and the cost of money
at 12 per cent. He added that French base rates may have to rise.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Moment of truth arrives for
Opec - Oil traders are waiting to see if producer backing for a substantial
output cut is more than just brave talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MINISTERS from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet
tomorrow in Vienna, they will be faced with tough decisions on cutting oil
output if they are to fulfil expectations of traders in the oil market. The
traders are looking for a cut of at least 1m barrels a day in production and
will push prices down in a spiral of disappointment if that is not agreed.
But ministers may be encouraged in their discussions by the similarities
between the market situation now and during the same period last year. Then,
in a similar pattern to this year, oil prices slumped in the first quarter,
forcing the producers' club to cut back its output ceiling by 1m b/d.
Discord at last year's meeting caused much criticism of the deal, but demand
held up later in the quarter and prices firmed.
Opec cannot afford to be too complacent, however, as market expectations of
a substantial cut in output are high. Mr Joe Stanislaw, managing director of
Cambridge Energy Research Associates said this week that prices could fall
by as much as Dollars 2 a barrel if Opec members failed to institute a
production cut of 1m b/d.
The market is looking to Opec to rein in output to about 23.5m b/d, a cut of
just over 1m b/d from the present ceiling of 24.58m b/d. But since members
are producing some 25m b/d, they will have to cut actual output further.
Mr Stanislaw said: 'the market no longer has any confidence in Opec to come
up with an agreement that they will abide by. . . if they don't deliver (the
1m b/d cut), the market will give no credence to what they say'.
Prices tumbled in the first quarter as market traders saw that Opec nations
were not sticking by their November accord to cut output. But prices have
been stronger in recent weeks following an initiative by Opec president, Mr
Alirio Parra, who is Venezuela's minister of energy and mining, to persuade
his colleagues to agree a cut.
Mr Parra's tour of Opec capitals produced a strong show of political will
for a production cut; but this must now be followed through with a tight
accord.
Mr Geoff Pyne, oil analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, the London brokers,
believes the political will among members is good, but the arithmetic
remains tricky. He is more optimistic about oil demand and believes the
market can absorb just over 24m b/d in the second quarter as US consumption
picks up.
He expects US demand to improve by almost 2 per cent this year as recovery
gets under way, but world demand will still be slow to pick up, rising by no
more than 1 per cent for the year.
Mr Youssef bin Omeir bin Youssef, United Arab Emirates' oil minister
expressed Opec's high hopes of a price recovery yesterday when he said a 1m
b/d cut in output for the second quarter would be enough to raise oil prices
by at least Dollars 1 a barrel.
The hopes of market traders and member nations are high: Opec now faces the
tough bargaining that must accompany any cut in production.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chromium price fall hits
Albanian revival plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBANIA'S ATTEMPTS to attract foreign investment into its chromium industry,
which until 1990 accounted for about 5 per cent of world production, are
being frustrated by a collapse in the metal's price.
A dozen companies, including some from Germany, Italy, Japan, and South
Africa, have shown interest in joint venture proposals to revitalise the
industry, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
which is advising the country.
But, when the deadline for bids passed at the end of January, some asked for
more time in view of the uncertainties caused by the price dropping by half
in the past year because of a surge in exports from Kazakhstan.
Samancor of South Africa, the world's biggest chromium producer, which held
talks over two years with Albania, no longer seems interested because of
present market conditions, which have forced it to consider cuts in its
production and workforce, according to Mr Mario Gobbo, a member of the
European Bank's merchant banking team. Also Ilva, the Italian steel group,
has asked for more time because of its own financial problems.
Mr Gobbo said Albania was still open to new approaches. He hoped to see more
from Japan and some from Taiwan.
Albania's government was pressing for a decision by the end of this month
but the European Bank is recommending that a deadline at the end of April
would be more realistic.
Albania, a country not quite as big as Belgium, has a population of about
3.5m. Some 13,000 are employed in the chromium industry - at chromite mines
scattered across the country and the two smelters, at Elbasan and Bureli.
Independent observers estimate the industry could operate with one-third of
its present workforce if modern equipment and methods were employed.
However, labour costs are low, equivalent to Dollars 30 a month for each
miner.
The smelters, each capable of producing 35,000 tonnes of chromium a year,
are of an old North Korean design with exceptionally poor working conditions
and they cause tremendous pollution.
Albania envisages a joint venture in which it would contribute assets while
a foreign partner put up capital, particularly to modernise the smelters.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed outlook for Australian
exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S COMMODITY exports face mixed prospects in the next five years,
with mineral and energy resources providing the main boost to the sagging
economy.
The official forecasting agency, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics, says the minerals sector will see a reasonable
improvement in prices in the medium term while prices of agricultural
commodities will stay relatively flat, then start to drift down again after
1995.
Mr Brian Fisher, executive director of Abare, told an annual forecasting
conference last week that Australia's commodity exports in 1992-93 would
rise 8 per cent to ADollars 47.4bn, thanks mainly to the weaker Australian
dollar.
Minerals would hold their ground in the 1990s, he said, with several major
new projects planned or being put into operation this year. These included
the world class Yandi and Marandoo iron ore mines, Mt Keith and Yackabindie
nickel mines, and Century and McArthur River lead and zinc mines.
Mr Jerry Ellis, executive general manager of BHP Minerals, said that during
the last two years, the mineral and energy sector grew 4.2 per cent
annually, compared with the average growth of 0.9 per cent of the Australian
economy.
Abare expects gold production to fall slightly to 238 tonnes in 1992-93,
followed by similar declines in the following two years. However, output
should grow strongly to 255 tonnes in 1995. Expenditure in gold exploration
in the next three years is expected to remain at the current level of just
over ADollars 300m.
Abare also forecasts strong growth in Australian coal exports despite
falling prices.
Exports of black coal are forecast to reach 188m tonnes in 2004 from the
current rate of 126m tonnes a year, while Thermal coal exports are expected
to double in that period to 124m tonnes a year. Asian demand for thermal
coal is expected to double from about 96m tonnes in 1996-97 to about 187m
tonnes by 2004. Japanese thermal coal imports are also forecast to rise
strongly, from 49m tonnes to about 86m tonnes in 2004.
Wheat also has a good outlook despite weaker prices. A few days after
Australia was forced to import wheat for the first time in more than 40
years, Abare predicted a 20 per cent increase in planting, expecting to
result in a significant increase on this year's harvest of 15.3m tonnes. It
said there were several factors causing world demand for wheat to outstrip
production.
On the downtrend is wool, of which Australia has an oversupply despite
falling production. Abare forecasts that 1992-93 shorn wool production will
fall to 837,000 tonnes in 1992-93 from 875,000 tonnes last year.
But Mr Mac Drysdale, chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, told the
Abare conference that if wool was a manufactured product the factory would
now be closed.
'We have 3.98m bales in the official stockpile. We have a growing unofficial
stockpile where growers are holding wool back in stores on farms. We have a
semi-processed stockpile and at the same time we have relatively high
production figures in Australia,' Mr Drysdale said.

765m copper mine deal

   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S SALOBO mining site should be producing 150,000 tonnes of copper and
eight tonnes of gold a year beginning in 1998, according to projections by
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, one of the partners in a joint venture accord to
exploit the site that was signed yesterday.
CVRD, Brazil's state-controlled mining concern, and holder of Salobo's
mineral rights, will team up with Morro Velho, a leading Brazilian gold
mining company that is half-owned by Anglo American. The two companies will
control equal shares of the Salobo venture.
The copper deposit is estimated at 1.2bn tonnes of ore. It is located in the
Carajas region, in the state of Para, in the Amazon. Development costs are
estimated at Dollars 765m. Initial engineering studies will begin
immediately and should be completed in 18 months. Overall investment
requirements are relatively modest because the site can rely on much of the
infrastructure already in place for CVRD's nearby iron ore operations.
The scheme will include an on-site plant to transform the mineral into metal
 -because of its special composition, the Salobo copper concentrate would
have a limited market.
Morro Velho's capacity and willingness to tackle an integrated project
weighed heavily in CVRD's decision to choose the company from a list of
potential partners, said Mr Helio Blak, CVRD superintendent for development.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Setback for salmon producers'
quota plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS BY Scottish salmon producers to reduce price fluctuations by
creating producer organisations to control output suffered a setback
yesterday when Sir Hector Monro, Scottish fisheries minister, gave only
limited support to the idea.
The Scottish salmon producers, who are now recovering after three bad years
in which prices were driven down by vast overproduction of salmon, mainly by
Norway, want to set up a number of producer organisations that would
restrain production by limiting the number of smolts (young salmon) which
could be put in the sea through quota restrictions on individual farmers.
The Scottish Salmon Growers Association said yesterday that Norway, Ireland
and Faroe were also keen to set up associations.
Although recommendations on each country's production would be voluntary to
avoid the accusation of being an international cartel, the smolt quotas set
by individual producer organisations would be mandatory and would cover both
members and non-members.
For this reason the producers need the UK government to endorse the scheme
for the approval of the European Commission, and bring in legislation or
statutory instruments to make the organisations' decisions mandatory.
However Sir Hector said that while he supported the creation of voluntary
producer organisations, the government did not want to see compulsory
bodies.

New York arabica COFFEE was broadly higher at midday after rallying on what
traders said was heavy trade short covering in the spot March contract.
London's robusta COFFEE closed with sharp gains of Dollars 38 to Dollars 49
a tonne as the market remained very volatile. There was little consensus
about the market's next move after the recent large price swings. On the LME
most markets were steady in a pretty featureless day. Physical offtake of
COPPER in Europe is extremely slow, which is restricting interest and
outweighing the positive implications of improved US economic data. Also,
shipments of CIS copper remain high. ZINC has lost upward momentum with no
further production cuts emerging, and dealers believe the market could
revert to the dull range seen for most of January between Dollars 1,060 and
Dollars 1,080 a tonne. Three-month NICKEL was unable to hold above Dollars
6,100 a tonne. But overall technicals are more constructive after recent
investment fund interest, dealers said.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wider market for venison
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILD VENISON, hitherto confined largely to the tables of the upper classes,
has begun appearing on the shelves of British supermarkets.
The Safeway supermarket group, which launched it last month, is invoking the
cause of nature conservation in its support. It has introduced a range of
venison products made from red deer stalked and shot in the Scottish
Highlands, claiming to be the first supermarket chain to market wild
venison.
It says it wants to broaden the diet of the British public and also help
reduce the population of red deer, which have become a serious problem in
parts of the Highlands.
The Scottish red deer population has expanded rapidly in recent years
because of warmer winters and insufficient culling by landowners. In places
deer are preventing the regeneration of pine forests and invading farmland.
Conservationists have been urging landowners to step up their annual deer
cull in over-populated areas. But the incentive to cull has been reduced in
the past three years by the collapse of venison prices.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY farm ministers will tonight make another attempt to reach
final agreement on the new banana regime they endorsed in principle last
December.
After a meeting which began on Tuesday and ran into Thursday morning, the
ministers failed to sign off on measures which would set a quota for cheap
Latin American banana imports of 2m tonnes, with an Ecu850 per tonne tariff
on imports above that level.
In December, Germany and Denmark - which at present occupies the EC
presidency - opposed the new regime, but the Netherlands and Belgium have
since raised objections.
In an acrimonious meeting this week, UK agriculture minister Mr John Gummer
accused the Dutch and Belgians of reneging on their commitments, while EC
farm commissioner Mr Rene Steichen was prepared to keep ministers in
Brussels until the March 1 deadline for legal endorsement.
Germany will certainly vote against the new regime anyway. But to meet the
objections of its allies, the commission said it would:
Agree upward adjustments of the quota, in line with market demand, on a
regular basis;
Give assurances that traditional importers of Latin American bananas would
not be prejudiced by the new licensing system in the proposals;
And regard any significant price rise as an indication of a shortage which
would require a review of the import regime.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Palladium hits 32-month high on
Japanese buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of palladium, a metal used mainly in consumer electrical goods and
as a dental alloy for filling teeth, yesterday reached Dollars 119 a troy
ounce - its highest level for 32 months.
Two reasons were suggested by traders and analysts: concern about supplies
from Russia, which accounts for about half the world's palladium output; and
speculative activity on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, which launched a
palladium futures contract in August last year.
Traders suggested that the price could reach Dollars 120 an ounce this week,
and possibly Dollars 125 an ounce by the time Tocom's February palladium
futures contract expired on February 24. They predicted, however, that it
would then quickly drop back.
Traders said the price 'spike' was being caused by speculators who had sold
palladium they did not own in the hope of buying it later at a lower price
scrambling to obtain metal to cover their obligations.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, part of Banque Bruxelles
Lambert, said that, apart from the Tocom activity, market sentiment was
being influenced by the fact that contract negotiations between Russia and
Japanese palladium users had been delayed two months. This suggested
something was wrong in Russia where supplies had fallen by 15 per cent last
year and were likely to fall again in 1993. Also the interest rate on leased
palladium had risen to more than 10 per cent, which indicated supplies were
tight.
Last November Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group,
estimated 1992 palladium demand would rise by 2.9 per cent to 3.86m ounces
while supply would fall by 4.1 per cent to 3.75m, giving a supply shortfall
of 110,000 ounces.
However, Mr Neil Carson, JM's marketing director, platinum, pointed out
yesterday that this followed two years of oversupply. 'There is no real
shortage of palladium, there is plenty about.' JM believed there were no
supply hitches in Russia but exports were being held up by bureaucrats who
did not understand the workings of the precious metals markets.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Successful auction spurs US prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK, LONDON

<TEXT>
US Treasury prices rose sharply across the board yesterday following an
unexpectedly successful auction of 30-year securities.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/16 at 105
13/32 , yielding 7.176 per cent, a substantial turnround from earlier in the
day when the 30-year issue had been  3/16 lower. Prices at the short end of
the market also received a substantial boost from the auction, with the
two-year note up  3/16 at 100 1/8 to yield 4.166 per cent.
After Wednesday's unexpectedly poor 10-year auction, dealers and investors
began the day in a cautious mood, wary of getting caught by a disappointing
30-year sale. Consequently, prices at the long end of the market were lower
until midday as participants held off until after the sale.
The auction, however, subsequently proved to be a big success, with the
bid-to-cover ratio (the measure of demand) on the 30-year issue coming in
strongly at 2.63:1, the highest since November 1987. The new securities were
eventually tendered at an average yield of 7.22 per cent, which was also the
highest yield at which the securities were awarded to bidders.
UK government bonds fell up to half a point yesterday on sterling weakness,
inflation worries and fears that further interest rate cuts may be delayed.
Long-dated gilts fell half a point, while short-dated paper lost a quarter
point yesterday. Dealers said market sentiment was not helped by comments
from Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England, who warned
against further cuts in interest rates.
The March gilt futures contract settled  9/16 down at 100 15/16 on volume of
43,328 lots.
ITALIAN government bonds experienced another volatile day as rumours
circulated in the market that Prime Minister Giuliano Amato was under
investigation on corruption charges.
The bond market started on a strong note, gaining about three-quarters of a
point, but then tumbled as the rumours circulated, although they were later
denied. Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, was forced to resign on
Wednesday when it emerged that he was under investigation.
On Liffe, the March BTP contract ended 20 basis points down at 95.60.
ELSEWHERE in Europe, German government bonds edged higher after trading in a
narrow range. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 93.31 and traded
between 93.28-93.48 before ending at around 93.42. Spanish government bonds
ended little changed, but dealers said attention would be focused on today's
repurchase tender to see whether there was an easing in interest rates.
JAPANESE government bonds rose in London trading as the yen strengthened
against the US dollar.
Although the Tokyo market was closed for National Foundation Day, bond
prices climbed in London trading with the yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB
moving from 4.235 per cent to end at around 4.215 per cent.

CITIBANK has designed a US corporate loan index to provide an effective
means of performance measurement, in a market which is becoming more
actively traded.
In the past few years, banks have become more active in their management of
loan assets, sometimes as a result of efforts to offload distressed debt or
to control credit risk.
The Citibank Loan Index comprises 1,000 floating-rate revolver and term
loans to over 600 companies, representing commitments of around Dollars
400bn.

CITIBANK has designed a US corporate loan index to provide an effective
means of performance measurement, in a market which is becoming more
actively traded.
Around Dollars 350bn is raised through the US corporate loan market every
year, while turnover in the secondary market currently totals around Dollars
14bn per year. Trading volume is estimated to be growing at an annual rate
of 15 per cent, according to Mr Rod Ballek, managing director of portfolio
management at Citibank, who helped design the index.
However, unlike other types of corporate debt, such as commercial paper and
bonds, corporate loans have not been seen as part of a fund manager's
investment portfolio until recently.
In the last few years, banks have become more active in their management of
loan assets, sometimes as a result of efforts to offload distressed debt or
to control credit risk.
The Citibank Loan Index comprises 1,000 floating-rate revolver and term
loans to over 600 companies, representing commitments of around Dollars

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: SFA to think again on futures
fund trading advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE treatment of futures fund trading advisers is to be re-considered by the
executive committee of the Securities and Futures Authority after the UK
regulator's capital committee failed to reach agreement on the issue last
week.
Earlier this week, three representatives of the futures fund industry met
SFA officials to put their case for a change in what they argue are onerous
requirements for small trading advisers, whose business is being driven
offshore as a result.
While the SFA made it clear that their original request for a separate
classification of futures fund trading advisers (commonly known as CTAs or
commodity trading advisers) will not be met, the SFA is considering relaxing
its capital rules for trading advisers.
Currently, trading advisers are treated in the same way as arranging brokers
who have some discretion over funds but do not handle clients' assets.
Consequently, they face more onerous requirements than advisory firms.
However, the SFA's executive committee will consider whether to change the
current requirement of Pounds 10,000 in liquid assets to a net asset test.
Essentially, this would allow futures fund advisers to include money of
their own invested in their funds to count towards capital, according to SFA
officials.
If such a change is made, the SFA may also demand greater disclosure of past
records of trading advisers.
The amount of money in futures funds and managed accounts around the world
is estimated at around Dollars 20bn, according to Tass Management, a
specialist tracking firm. However, the bulk of the market is in the US, with
only some Dollars 2bn managed in Europe.
Those familiar with the industry are concerned that the futures fund
business will develop in offshore centres rather than in the UK, if
regulatory requirements prove too onerous.
Mr Peter Moon, of Royston Investments, one of the three industry
representatives who saw the SFA this week, said he was extremely
disappointed by the meeting. 'This is such a small step and one they seem to
be taking reluctantly,' he said. 'They are not really looking at the issue
of how to expand this industry.'

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Ireland's DM1.5bn paper attracts retail
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Ireland became the latest EC member state to borrow in
D-Marks yesterday, adding to its foreign exchange reserves after the
unsuccessful rear-guard action to shore up the punt last month.
The republic's DM1.5bn issue of 10-year bonds, increased from an initial
DM1bn, was widely seen as a success when set against the Kingdom of Spain's
DM4bn, 10-year issue last week.
Although an AA3/AA- credit, compared with the AA2/AA of Spain, Ireland's
bonds were launched with a yield 24 basis points above the benchmark
government bond, marginally tighter than the 25 basis point spread on the
Spanish bonds. Spain's issue had already tightened from a 31 basis point
yield spread at the time of launch a week earlier.
Deutsche Bank, which led the issue and took two thirds of the bonds on to
its own books, said demand had been strong from both German and Swiss retail
investors, while other banks involved in the deal also reported good demand
from Germany. Late in the day, Deutsche was bidding 100.15 for the bonds,
above the reoffered price of 100.06.
While a queue of sovereign and supranational issuers continued to be
rumoured in D-Marks, among them Belgium, Denmark and the European Community,
the autonomous Spanish region of Andalucia was the only borrower to declare
definite plans to come to the market next week. The region, which has not
been to the international market before, plans to issue DM300m of five-year
bonds at a yield spread of 75-80 basis points. Andalucia carries an AA3
rating from Moody's, and expects to return to the market later in the year
to help fund its Pta130bn borrowing programme.
The EC, meanwhile, turned to the Ecu bond market yesterday for the first
part of its exercise to fund its recently agreed loan to Italy. Following
Finland's Ecu500m issue on Monday, this was only the second big Eurobond
issue since the turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism took hold
last summer.
The EC's issue, which sold out quickly, thanks mainly to the quality of the
name, was widely seen as a better test of sentiment in the Ecu bond market
than Finland's offer. Its success led to suggestions that other borrowers
will use the currency in the coming weeks, although its long-term future was
still open to question.
The yield on Ecu bonds yesterday was around the same level as the
theoretical yield on the basket of currencies that make up the Ecu, a
recovery from the depths of the market last autumn, when the yield was some
40 basis points above the theoretical level.
The EC's three-year bonds were brought with a yield of 7.785 per cent, four
basis points above the UK's three-year Ecu notes auctioned last week, and
held their level in later trading.
Ford Motor Credit Company launched a Dollars 1bn global issue through
Goldman Sachs, though the bonds were said to have met demand almost
exclusively from the US. Early price talk, indicating a yield spread of
78-80 basis points over five-year Treasuries when the bonds are priced
today, was said to have attracted almost no interest in the international
market.
'Not many people are interested in a single-A US car company,' commented one
banker, who said he had taken no orders at all outside the US. Good demand
from inside the US, though, led the indicated yield spread down to 75-77
basis points later in the day.
Meanwhile, continuing expectations of early cuts in UK interest rates
brought a further Pounds 100m of reverse floating-rate notes, which pay a
higher yield as interest rates fall.
The three-year issue, which takes the total in the past two weeks to Pounds
700m, was launched by Samuel Montagu through a special purpose vehicle,
Thames Investments. The paper was backed by Pounds 100m of three-year gilts
with a coupon of 13 1/4 per cent: coupon payments from these gilts will be
used to pay interest on the floating-rate notes.
The structure, which relied on the bank's ability to buy a tranche of
high-coupon gilts in the market at a low price, due to the intrinsic lack of
demand for such paper, enabled Samuel Montagu to offer terms which were
slightly better than those typically seen so far: a return based on 12 3/4
per cent minus six-month Libor, rather than 12 3/8 per cent, and an initial
minimum coupon of 7 1/8 per cent, rather than 7 per cent.
The Republic of Colombia is preparing to return to the international market
for the first time since the debt crisis in the early 1980s.
However, Colombia has never defaulted on commercial bank debt, although it
has stretched the maturity of some loans.
Bankers Trust has won the mandate to arrange a Dollars 100m-Dollars 150m
offering of five-year Eurobonds, with an option for distribution in the US
private placement market.
The deal is expected to be launched in late March or early April.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Western Mining halves payout as
profits tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Mining, the Aus-tralian metals and commodities producer, has come
through another six months marred by low prices and asset write-downs with a
halved dividend and reduced profits.
The company is cutting its interim dividend from 6 cents to 3 cents a share
following a 44.3 per cent reduction in net equity-accounted earnings to
ADollars 53m (USDollars 35.8m) for the six months ended December. Total
revenue improved 2.6 per cent to ADollars 820.4bn.
The result was before an abnormal loss of ADollars 26.2m, mainly reflecting
amortisation and asset write-offs. This compares with abnormals a year ago
of ADollars 200m when the company wrote down the value of its mining
properties, mainly in the gold mines.
The biggest blow to the group, headed by chief executive Sir Arvi Parbo,
came from low world nickel prices which cut nickel earnings from ADollars
19.5m to ADollars 7.9m. Average nickel prices received fell 8.8 per cent in
the year, with a 6.8 per cent cut in output contributing to higher unit
costs.
Oil earnings fell to ADollars 27.1m from ADollars 31.2m and the equity
contribution from the Alcoa aluminium group fell to ADollars 56.5m from
ADollars 77.8m.
Gold earnings remained static at just over ADollars 40m, but the Olympic Dam
copper-uranium project pushed ahead strongly, lifting earnings to ADollars
27.4m from ADollars 10.3m.
Despite the tight trading conditions, the company lifted capital expenditure
to ADollars 194m from ADollars 170m, mainly on expansion of nickel capacity.
Western Mining is to proceed with development of the Mt Keith nickel deposit
in Western Australia at a likely cost of about ADollars 350m and had also
reached agreement in principle for the sale of the Chibougamau gold mine in
Canada.
The result followed a tax credit of ADollars 11.3m (against a ADollars 24.7m
charge) and depreciation of ADollars 174.5m, against ADollars 135.6m.
Exploration expenditure written off fell to ADollars 34.1m from ADollars
45.4m and the company's interest expense fell to ADollars 16.1m from
ADollars 21m.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: National Semi tries to pull out
of a death spiral - The US semiconductor company is taking steps to end its
decline and make a come-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Semiconductor is fighting its way out of a death spiral, according
to Mr Gil Amelio, president and chief executive.
Under the buccaneering leadership of Mr Amelio's predecessor, Mr Charles
Sporck, National Semi was the epitome of the rough, tough US semiconductor
company. Its strategy was simple: to drive down costs and prices and push up
market share.
But since the mid-1980s, it has been in decline. It had expanded ambitiously
in areas of semiconductor production which became suddenly unfashionable. It
has been eclipsed in memory chips by the Japanese and in microprocessors by
its compatriots Intel and Motorola. Last year, National Semi lost Dollars
117m before tax from continuing operations on sales of just over Dollars
1.7bn, its fourth year in the red at both the operating and pre-tax level.
Under Mr Amelio, who took over in early 1991, staff numbers have been
trimmed, old and unprofitable plants closed and investment redirected
towards fast-growing areas of the market, especially networking products and
communications. But Mr Amelio has no illusions about the size of the task
remaining. He says: 'Because for so many years we were frankly defocused,
frankly unprofitable, it will take time to change perceptions. Over a period
of time, I think we will build a new kind of reputation, but I am not so
naive as to think I can do it in 18 months.'
Wall Street is taking a sympathetic if scarcely euphoric view of his
efforts. The slide in the company's share price, which saw it fall from a
high of over Dollars 20 in 1987 to a low of less than Dollars 4 in mid-1990,
seems to have halted. It is now hovering around the Dollars 12 mark.
Mr Amelio, 49, is a semiconductor industry veteran who began his career in
Bell Laboratories and has since served as general manager of Fairchild
Camera's microprocessor division and president of Rockwell Communications
Systems.
His manufacturing background proved valuable in diagnosing National
Semiconductor's sickness - too many plants making the wrong kind of
semiconductors. He explains that in the 1970s, the company's heyday,
semiconductors were building blocks, sold in billions to be incorporated
into bigger systems. Manufacturers could sell all they could make:
In the 1980s, however, the market changed irrevocably. According to Mr
Amelio, National failed to appreciate the transformation. Chips became so
complex they resembled complete sub-systems rather than components. The new
trick was to build a relationship with the customer so that the use to which
the semiconductor was to be put was fully appreciated and the customer's
requirements understood.
National did none of those things, and its market share began to slip.
'Unchecked,' Mr Amelio observes of the spiral, 'you crash and burn.' His
plan to avoid that involves three measures:
First, he is restructuring the manufacturing base. Three factories have
already been sold or closed, and only seven will remain of the 11 currently
operating. Those seven, Mr Amelio estimates, will have enough capacity to
support a Dollars 5bn turnover company.
Second, it is abandoning its role as a broad-based supplier in favour of
concentration on three areas: communication products, analogue devices and
microprocessors for personal computer peripherals.
Third, control of the company is being split along product and market lines;
separate groups have been established for commodity products and higher
value sub-systems.
The restructuring charge for plant and people in 1991 was Dollars 150m. The
headcount by the end of the year will be under 24,000, a fall of more than
8,000 in two years. Productivity is rising accordingly. Taking productivity
as sales divided by total labour costs, Mr Amelio reckons the best
semiconductor houses such as Intel achieve over 3.0. National is presently
at 2.7, the aim being to reach 3.0 some time next year.
Spending on research and development is down, however, to Dollars 192m last
year, about 11 per cent of sales, from Dollars 225m four years ago. Mr
Amelio claims this is the right amount, pointing out he has shifted research
and development priorities drastically.
Investment in networking has risen from 9 per cent of the total to 17 per
cent. In analogue devices it has gone from 19 per cent to 26 per cent. R&amp;D
on commodity products, by contrast, has been cut from 21 per cent to just 5
per cent.
The question remains if National can make an effective come-back without
spending the large sums in plant and research its larger competitors are
committing. Intel, for example, is spending at a rate of almost Dollars 1bn
a year on plant and equipment. National's capital spending last year came to
Dollars 189m.
Mr Amelio's optimism is unquenchable, however. 'The explosive growth in the
1980s was in personal computers. In the 1990s it will be in communications.
We are going to do our damndest to be at the head of that parade.'

RAND Merchant Bank, the financial services group recently involved in a
merger with the assurer Momentum Life, reported increased earnings for the
six months to end-December. It plans to increase its dividend.
Net income after tax and contingency reserve transfers rose to R21.5m
(Dollars 6.9m) from R13m. Earnings per share rose by 27 per cent to 30
cents. The dividend is increasing to 10.5 cents from 8.5 cents a share.
Minus Momentum Life, the increase in earnings per share would have been 23
per cent.
Momentum Life increased premium income by 48 per cent to R420.2m, but this
mostly reflected a number of large transactions in single premium income
which are unlikely to be repeated. All divisions of Rand Merchant Bank
performed satisfactorily.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: IBM's mainframes enter the
microprocessor age - Big Blue is developing two new lines which will be more
price competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines plans to bring its traditional mainframe
computers into the microprocessor age, significantly reducing their cost and
making them more price competitive with 'client-server' networks of desktop
computers.
The latest generation of 'micro-mainframes' represents a central element of
IBM's strategy to stem the erosion of its traditional mainframe computer
market, which is seen by many as the primary cause of the company's
financial woes. For 1992 IBM reported net losses of Dollars 4.9bn.
As it struggles to regain the confidence of customers and investors, IBM
this week revealed it is developing two new lines of mainframe-power
computers built using multiple microprocessor chips similar to those that
power desktop computers. IBM's 'classic' mainframe computers will also be
re-engineered to use microprocessor chips.
'Our aim is to take a lot of the cost out of the systems, by replacing
expensive processing units used in today's mainframe computers with
integrated circuit chips,' said Mr Nicholas Donofrio, general manager of
IBM's Enterprise Systems division.
One of the new lines will be based on reduced instruction set computing
(Risc) microprocessor chips that are currently used in IBM's RS/6000
workstations.
By using several of these chips working in parallel, IBM plans to create
mainframe-class computers.
The first of these 'power parallel' computers will be delivered within the
next few months, Mr Donofrio said. It will be aimed at technical and
scientific applications. However, in about 12 months, IBM will offer similar
computers designed for commercial applications, he said.
By gradually increasing the number of microprocessors in these computers,
IBM will build a broad product line of computers. Like the company's
workstation products, these will run the popular Unix operating system.
The second product line will be based on a microprocessor version of IBM's
current S/390 mainframe processor, also using parallel processing
techniques. Aimed at IBM's current mainframe customers it will be designed
to run existing mainframe applications programs.
In addition, IBM is planning microprocessor-based versions of its 'classic'
mainframe designs.
'During the second half of the 1990s, we plan to have an entire mainframe
family based on microprocessor technology,' Mr Donofrio said. The planned
systems will significantly reduce the cost of mainframe computing, he said.
In the meantime, IBM is attempting to dispel the impression that its
traditional mainframe computers are a dying breed by stressing the role that
mainframe computers can play in new client-server networks as
'superservers'.
This is hardly a new message. IBM has been trying to redefine the role of
the mainframe more favourably for over two years.
However, the company is now planning 'an intense campaign, bringing in real
users and software developers' to talk about client-server applications of
mainframe computers, Mr Donofrio said.
Also getting new emphasis are the 'open systems' features of IBM mainframes.
IBM will bring its proprietary software into line with existing and emerging
standards, the company promises, to make it possible to link IBM mainframes
to networks of computers from other manufacturers.
The most concrete demonstration of IBM's determination to keep its mainframe
sales alive is that customers world-wide will now be able to set the price
they are prepared to pay for the latest versions of IBM's mainframes,
including the models and upgrades announced this week.
IBM has thrown out the price list that has previously established the
starting point for negotiation of selling prices for its mainframes. The
move brings IBM's US pricing policy into line with the approach it has taken
in the UK for the past three years.
Competitors see the new approach as recognition of existing market
conditions in which 'it is probably several years since anybody paid IBM's
list price, every prospective customer knows that', according to Hitachi
Data Systems, one of IBM's competitors in the mainframe market.
IBM hints it is going to become more aggressive in mainframe pricing. 'We
are not going to lose market share,' says Mr Donofrio.
However, the move could backfire. With no list prices, customers will have
to get competing bids to ensure that they are getting a fair price, Hitachi
suggests.

WOOLWORTH, the US retailing group, does not plan to sell its general
merchandise or specialty store operations in Germany, AP-DJ reports from New
York.
The company had announced in November that it was exploring the possible
disposal of some or all of its German operations.

WOOLWORTH, the US retailing group, does not plan to sell its general
merchandise or specialty store operations in Germany, AP-DJ reports from New
York.
The company had announced in November that it was exploring the possible
disposal of some or all of its German operations.
Woolworth operates more than 500 stores in Germany through its subsidiaries,
including 330 Woolworth general merchandise stores and 190 specialty stores.
The company said its German operations would continue to operate under its
present management.
The company also operates 144 Foot Locker athletic footwear and apparel
stores in eight countries in Europe. Woolworth said it still planned to be
operating at least 1,000 Foot Locker stores throughout Europe by the year
2000.
Woolworth has also named Mr William Lavin as chairman and chief executive to
replace Mr Harold Sells when he retires, at the age of 65, in July.
Mr Lavin, who is 48, has served as chief financial officer of the US
retailer since 1991. He joined Woolworth in 1981.
An announcement about Mr Sells' successor has been widely expected since
September, when a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed that Mr
Sells had sold Dollars 3.4m of stock in the company.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T in damages claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle for market share in America's long-distance communications
business has taken a new legal twist with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,
the largest long-distance group, asking a federal court to award it damages
against three rivals: MCI Communications, Sprint and WilTel.
It complained they had undercut AT&amp;T's rates by providing 'secret' contracts
to business customers.
The action stems from an appeal court ruling in Washington DC last November
that all long-distance carriers must publish their prices in accordance with
the Communications Act of 1934.
AT&amp;T said its damages claim covered 'many millions of dollars.'
MCI said AT&amp;T had been stung by a 'a continuing string of losses to MCI
among its largest customers,' and it dismissed as 'absurd' the assertion
that secret deals had denied customers the benefits of competition.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ford follows GM with
introduction of credit cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORD Motor, in partnership with Citibank, yesterday followed rival General
Motors and launched consumer credit cards offering customers substantial
discounts on the purchase of Ford vehicles.
The move will intensify competition in the US credit-card market, where
traditional bank issuers are being challenged by new entrants such as GM and
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, offering rebates on goods and services.
Ford's introduction of Visa and MasterCards comes six months after the
launch of the GM MasterCard - the most successful US credit-card
introduction ever, attracting more than 4.5m cardholders. Ford said
yesterday it aimed to top GM, but gave no forecasts.
For Ford, and GM before it, the cards are an attempt to build brand loyalty
through a new form of customer rebate. GM's share of the US car market
dipped from 35.9 per cent in 1991 to 34.9 per cent last year, while Ford's
rose 1.7 per cent to 21.8 per cent.
For Citibank, the leading issuer of credit cards in the US, the Ford tie-up
could mean a sizeable increase in its card-holder base at a time when its
account growth has been slowing. 'This is an effort to grow the business,'
said Mr James Bailey, who heads north American consumer banking.
The bank already has similar partnerships with other major US corporations,
notably one with American Airlines which allows cardholders to earn points
towards free travel.
Ford's card allows customers to earn rebates, equal to 5 per cent of their
purchases, of up to Dollars 700 a year for five years, and then get a rebate
of Dollars 3,500 on the purchase of a vehicle.
Ford claimed its card was superior to GM's in that it offered a Dollars
3,500 rebate over five years, rather than seven; a lower rate of interest on
outstanding balances; and the advantages of a link-up with Citibank, which
offers card-holders fringe benefits. GM's card is administered by Household
Credit Services, the ninth largest US card issuer.
Ford's card charges a Dollars 20 annual fee, while GM's has none. However,
the fee will be waived for the first year and payment thereafter will
qualify holders for an annual, additional Dollars 50 rebate when they buy a
Ford vehicle.

final period

<TEXT>
CBS, which owns one of the three US television networks, has reported a 254
per cent surge in fourth-quarter net income, reflecting the network's rise
to the top of the prime-time television ratings and a better advertising
environment.
The group posted fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 33.3m, or Dollars 2.14
a share, against Dollars 9.4m, or 61 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 3 per
cent to Dollars 968.3m, from Dollars 937.4m.
For the whole of 1992, CBS earned Dollars 81m, or Dollars 5.23, compared
with a loss of Dollars 85.8m, or Dollars 5.32 in 1991.
Income from continuing operations stood at Dollars 162.5m, or Dollars 10.51,
against a deficit of Dollars 98.7m, or Dollars 6.11 a year ago. Sales rose
15 per cent in the year to Dollars 2.5bn from Dollars 3.04bn.
Mr Laurence Tisch, group chairman and chief executive, said the television
network returned to a modest level of profitability in 1992, helped by
improved results in entertainment, news and sports programming. He said the
company was also 'applying our resources in wiser, more cost-effective
ways.'
The strong growth in the network's prime-time ratings, which Mr Tisch said
was the biggest single-season gain by any network since 1976-77 allowed the
group to increase advertisement unit pricing and lifted revenues.
'We presently believe that CBS's 1993 operating earnings may surpass 1992's
level as a result of further gains in earnings at the television network,'
he said.

turnround in income

SHARES in Cummins Engine, the world's biggest independent manufacturer of
diesel engines, rose sharply yesterday after the US company reported
fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 24m, a sharp turnround from the Dollars
2.3m it lost at the same stage a year ago.
The company's earnings in the latest quarter would have been higher, but for
the extraordinary charge of Dollars 5.5m Cummins took to cover early
retirement of high-cost debt.
Despite the charge, however, investors were cheered by the news from
Cummins, which has now made a profit in the last four quarters thanks to a
combination of cost-cutting measures and a revival in key markets that has
helped the company recover from a string of losses. Cummins' shares rose
Dollars 3 to Dollars 84 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
For the full-year, Cummins earned Dollars 67.1m, compared with a Dollars
65.6m loss incurred in 1991. The net effect of adopting three new accounting
standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, however, left
the company with a net loss of Dollars 189.5m last year.
Sales to the North American heavy-duty truck market, where the company
maintains a market share of about 38 per cent, rose in the fourth quarter.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Southern belle puts on fresh
make-up - The chairman of Delta explains the recent dramatic changes at the
airline to Paul Betts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER in the highly cyclical history of civil aviation have times been quite
so bad, said Mr Ronald Allen, chairman of Delta Air Lines, the third biggest
US carrier.
'We can't wait for the economy to turn around: we must re-engineer our
airline and reduce our costs,' he added during a brief visit to London.
The last few months have seen dramatic changes at the Atlanta-based airline,
long regarded as the 'Southern belle' of the US industry because of its
conservative and profitable track record.
Delta is still 'a good, strong airline', said Mr Allen, but 'we are not
immune to the kind of pressures that are facing this industry'.
The carrier has incurred only four annual losses in its history: in 1947,
1983 and in its last two fiscal years ended June 1991 and June 1992. But its
recent losses have been even bigger than those of its two big US rivals:
American Airlines and United Airlines. After a net loss of Dollars 324.4m in
the year to June 1991, Delta's deficit rose to a record Dollars 506.3m for
the year to June 1992. In its current year, it has so far lost Dollars 233m.
Mr Allen's response has been to launch what he calls a 'profit improvement
plan' to save Dollars 375m by the end of this June and as much as Dollars
750m by the end of June 1995. This includes a consolidation of existing
activities; rescheduling and reallocation of flights; deferring deliveries
of more than Dollars 6bn worth of new aircraft ordered by the airline, which
already counts a fleet of some 560 airliners; and a 5 per cent pay cut for
its 75,000 employees.
The company also cut its quarterly dividend last December and has shed 5,000
jobs during the past 12 months through early retirements, freezing
recruitment and reducing the number of temporary workers.
'Although we reduced the dividend from 30 cents a share to a nickel (5
cents), we are one of the few carriers still paying a dividend,' Mr Allen
emphasised, adding that he was encouraged to see the cost reductions
starting to feed into the airline's financial performance. 'The results of
the December quarter were disappointing but better than last year and almost
all the improvement was due to cost reduction,' he explained.
Delta's problems have been compounded by an unfortunate sequence of events.
It started when the now-defunct Eastern Airlines, operating under US Chapter
11 bankruptcy rules, decided to rebuild three years ago a hub at Atlanta,
Delta's home base.
'We found ourselves competing against a bankrupt airline which was cutting
fares in an effort to generate cash flow,' Mr Allen said. When Iraq invaded
Kuwait the following year, Delta, like the rest of the industry, went into a
tailspin. 'Our fuel bill alone doubled,' Mr Allen said.
Recession and the impact of the Gulf crisis pushed more US carriers into
Chapter 11. 'At the peak of the crisis, almost 30 per cent of US traffic was
controlled by bankrupt airlines which were not paying their bills: that
situation still persists today with about 20 per cent of the our market
controlled by bankrupt airlines,' Mr Allen explained.
In the middle of all this came Delta's decision to acquire Pan American's
European routes for Dollars 506m. Although the timing was unfortunate, Mr
Allen claimed he had no regrets about the purchase. 'It was a very important
deal for us strategically and tactically: it was a once in a lifetime
opportunity,' he said.
To compete on the important transatlantic market, Delta needed to strengthen
its presence in New York and the north-east of the US. Mr Allen said his
airline needed to increase its presence in this market in order to avoid
losing business on both transatlantic and domestic US routes.
But absorbing the Pan Am assets proved more difficult than expected. 'You
have to accept some difficulties when you are buying assets from a bankrupt
company,' Mr Allen acknowledged. One example was the old Pan Am terminal at
New York's JFK airport. 'The problem was that the roof leaked. We had to fix
that first before we could upgrade the interior, but by this summer our JFK
terminal should be a pretty good show case,' he said.
Although the Pan Am route acquisition made Delta the biggest airline serving
the north Atlantic market, it has struggled to establish a strong identity
in the European market. For this reason it has just appointed a new
vice-president for Europe - Mr Michael Medlicott, former chief executive of
the British Tourist Authority.
Delta is also banking on its trilateral alliance with Swissair and Singapore
Airlines to strengthen its global operations both in the European and the
Asia-Pacific markets. But Mr Allen stressed that his airline's cross-equity
holdings in Swissair and Singapore Airlines differed from the recent spate
of alliances with other US carriers.
'Most of the current alliances formed with US airlines are bail-outs of
financially troubled US carriers which are looking for money,' Mr Allen
said.
Delta, together with American and United, has led the campaign against
British Airways' equity investment in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier.
The big three US carriers successfully lobbied the Bush administration last
winter to block BA's original proposal to acquire a 44 per cent stake in
USAir for Dollars 750m.
They are now renewing their efforts with the Clinton administration to
torpedo BA's revised deal with USAir, initially involving a Dollars 300m
investment by BA for a 19.9 per cent stake in the Pittsburg-based carrier.
'The latest BA deal is only a warmed-up version of the original one and
their intent is the same,' Mr Allen claimed. Together with the other two big
US carriers, Delta has asked the administration to declare a moratorium on
all foreign investment in US airlines until the US government clearly
defines a new international aviation policy.
'The new administration has a wonderful opportunity to redefine the rules
for everyone: we favour open skies and we want to compete in an open market
place,' Mr Allen said.
In other words, the US should only allow BA to establish a strong foothold
into the US market through its partnership with USAir if, in return, the
other US carriers are given greater access into the UK market, and
especially into London's Heathrow airport.

<TEXT>
COMPAGNIE Bancaire, the specialised financial business owned by Paribas, the
French banking group, has warned that it may have to rationalise its
international operations following a steep fall in net profits to FFr369m
(Dollars 66m) last year, from FFr579m in 1991.
The company, which has large interests in property finance in the UK, has
been badly affected by the crisis in the UK property sector. Its UK
interests plunged further into the red last year with a net loss of FFr811m,
against FFr88m the previous year.
Compagnie Bancaire fared better in France, where net profits for 1992 rose
by 11 per cent to FFr1.34bn, mainly due to a strong performance from its
credit and life insurance businesses.
Mr Michel Francois-Henrot, chief executive, said Compagnie Bancaire planned
to scrutinise all its foreign activities and would sell or close all those
that did not perform. Banque Paribas, the French bank, has had its long-term
credit rating placed under review for possible downgrade by Moody's, the
international rating agency, adds Sara Webb in London.
Moody's said the review affects about Dollars 690m of long-term debt. Banque
Paribas' long-term debt is currently rated Aa2, while its short-term
certificates of deposit - which are not under review - are rated Prime-1.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Preussag, the German steel, trading, energy and metals
group, rose by DM15m to DM425m (Dollars 257m) in the year to the end of
September. This was despite a 4 per cent drop in turnover from DM29.7bn to
DM28.5bn.
Mr Ernst Pieper, chief executive, said that, in the first quarter of the
current year, pre-tax profits were less than the DM130m in the comparable
period of the previous year.
He said that the current year would be difficult for the group in the light
of the general economic downturn. But he was confident that the group would
'come through' relatively well because of its mixture of businesses. Some
analysts' predictions of a 10 per cent drop in profits for the year were
speculation, he added.
'Catastrophic' conditions in the steel industry and a difficult metals
market would be balanced by a strong performance from other parts of the
group, including energy, transport, ship-building and plant construction, Mr
Pieper said.
As a measure of his confidence, he pointed to a 4 per cent increase in the
order intake to DM6.2bn in the period from October to December 1992. Sales
dropped 5 per cent to DM6bn, mainly because of falling steel and base metals
prices.
As previously announced, the dividend for 1991-92 is to be held at DM10 per
share, the same level as in the previous year.
Mr Pieper, 64, appointed chief executive of Preussag in 1990 following the
company's acquisition of the Salzgitter steel and engineering group from the
west German government, will step down as chief executive at the beginning
of next year. His successor is to be Mr Michael Frenzel, 45, who was
appointed deputy chief executive in March last year.
MAN, the engineering and truck group, said yesterday that orders improved by
25 per cent in the second quarter of the current financial year, compared to
the first quarter, when they dropped sharply.
In the six months to December, total order intake was 14 per cent down at
DM7.4bn. Sales for the six months were DM8.2bn, the same level as in the
first half of the previous year.

CS HOLDING, the parent company of Credit Suisse, has acquired 19.2 per cent
of the equity of Swiss Volksbank, for which CS made a SFr1.6bn (Dollars
1.04bn) agreed takeover bid.
CS said in its offer circular yesterday the shares were acquired after its
bid was announced on January 6. The acceptance period began yesterday and
ends on March 15.
The basis of the offer is three CS registered shares for every 10 Volksbank
registered shares. It is conditional on Volksbank winning approval at an EGM
on March 11 to convert itself from a co-operative into a joint stock company
and then converting each of its co-operative shares into 10 registered
shares.
The offer will then be conditional on receiving acceptances from holders of
at least 70 per cent of the Volksbank shares by March 15.
If the offer is successful, CS said it would seek to delist Volksbank
securities from Swiss stock exchanges.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: GM Europe net profit declines
30% to Dollars 1.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE net profit of the European operations of General Motors, the world's
largest vehicle maker, fell last year by 30.4 per cent to Dollars 1.228bn
from Dollars 1.76bn in 1991 and a record Dollars 1.92bn in 1990.
Despite the decline, GM Europe - Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in
the UK - remained one of the most profitable of the big six volume car
makers in 1992. Its performance in Europe was in sharp contrast to its rival
Ford, which disclosed earlier this week a record Dollars 1.3bn loss on its
European automotive operations, including Jaguar.
GM's European profits provided a partial cushion for the continuing heavy
losses suffered by the group's North American automotive operations. The net
profit of Dollars 1.2bn in Europe was also achieved after taking account of
GM's 50 per cent share of the continuing losses of Saab Automobile, where
the US group has management control. The Swedish carmaker is expected to
announce later this month a loss of more than SKr2bn (Dollars 270m) for
1992.
GM also suffered continuing losses in Europe last year at Group Lotus, the
UK specialist sports car maker and automotive engineering consultancy, and
it incurred losses through the restructuring of the European subsidiary of
GM Hughes Electronics.
Within its core Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations GM
added significantly to its fixed costs in 1992 with the opening of several
new plants, including a DM1bn (Dollars 625m) car assembly plant at Eisenach
in eastern Germany and a Pounds 190m (Dollars 266m) V6 engine plant at
Ellesmere Port in the UK.
The 1992 financial performance was also burdened by part of the start-up
costs for the new generation Opel/Vauxhall Corsa small car at GM's plant at
Zaragoza, Spain, as well as by a deterioration in the mix of its product
sales with a shift to a larger share of small cars in southern Europe and
lower sales in Germany.
The group's Opel/Vauxhall operations achieved a record sales volume of 1.61m
cars in west Europe last year, up from 1.55m in 1991, with a best-ever
market share of 12 per cent, an increase from 11.6 per cent in 1991. Car
production rose by 5.7 per cent to 1,700,053 from 1,607,629 a year earlier.
GM's turnover in Europe rose by 13.7 per cent to Dollars 28.8bn from Dollars
25.4bn a year earlier.

Bergesen's earnings

<TEXT>
BERGESEN, Norway's biggest shipping group, yesterday revealed a sharp
decline in 1992 net profit to NKr25m (Dollars 3.5m) from NKr716m the
previous year, caused by significant weakness in the world crude oil tanker
market and a write-down of the group's share portfolio.
Group operating revenue sank to NKr2.64bn last year, from NKr3.12bn in 1991.
Operating profit plunged to NKr203m, from NKr857m. This was due to a NKr639m
fall to NKr173m in operating profit from shipping operations.
The company has proposed an unchanged dividend payment of NKr1 per share.
Bergesen's tanker division fell to an operating loss of NKr218m, from a
NKr464m profit in 1991.
It was pushed into the red by a steep decline in day rates, which were
almost halved to Dollars 16,200 from Dollars 30,300 in 1991.
Bergesen's weak performance was exacerbated by a NKr143m write-down on the
group's share portfolio and a NKr117m unrealised loss on foreign currency.
Mr Morten Bergesen, chief executive, explained that, although 25 of the
world's tankers had been scrapped last year, 26 newly-built units had
entered the market.
He forecast the scrapping of more old tankers this year, but he warned that
balance in the tanker market may not be restored for another two years.
Lower profits could also be expected in 1993 from liquid petroleum gas (LPG)
carrier operations, he added.
Bergesen's fleet suffered a sharp decline in value in 1992, measured in
dollars, with tankers falling by 40 per cent, LPG carriers by 20 per cent
and dry bulk carriers by 28 per cent.
The group experienced a NKr184m net financial loss in 1992, compared with
financial income of NKr40m a year earlier.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banesto quells Spanish banking's
ridicule - A forthcoming rights issuse which could net Pta53bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR YEARS now it has been fashionable among the chattering core of Madrid's
financial community to muse loudly and often, on the imminent demise of both
Banesto, Spain's third largest bank, and its mercurial chairman, Mr Mario
Conde.
That will probably change with Wednesday's announcement that JP Morgan, the
US investment bank, is throwing its weight behind a rights issue being
prepared by Banesto by assembling a group of subscribers who could end up
holding 10 per cent of the bank. Yesterday the gallery was silent.
The arrangement is a sweet one for Banesto. The issue will raise, if it is
taken up, Pta53bn (Dollars 452m) in one of the biggest ever capital
increases in Spain.
Normally, this news would have been greeted as just another effort by
Banesto to claw money from its shareholders. But JP Morgan's presence is a
startling vote of confidence in the bank. Not least because it has chosen
Banesto as the first investment for the Dollars 1bn Corsair investment fund
it closed last week after signing up 46 blue chip US institutional and
individual subscribers.
The US bank researched Banesto for seven months before committing itself to
leading a group of investors who will guarantee to spend Dollars 200m on the
rights issue. Mr Conde is himself a member of the group and could more than
double his personal stake in Banesto from 2 per cent to 4.5 per cent.
The psychology of this is everything. When Mr Conde helped rescue Banesto
from takeover in 1987, it was an entangled mess of rival family industrial
and banking interests, living off a cosy interest rate arrangement between
Spain's banks and regular asset disposals every time banking profits dipped.
In undoing that and separating Banesto's banking and industrial businesses,
Mr Conde made enemies and gathered critics. Many of his grand plans failed -
in late 1990 he was forced to call off a flotation of the Banesto industrial
group after the Gulf crisis took the wind out of the markets.
That could have raised more than Pta75bn at the time. Since then, he has
been forced to sell industrial assets off piecemeal. His attention has been
diverted from core banking and many analysts have wondered whether, as an
industrialist by training, he is fit to run a bank.
But JP Morgan has found something it likes. On fundamentals, Banesto is not
Spain's best bank. It just meets the country's capital adequacy ratios; last
year it recorded the sharpest bad debt growth among big banks; and it
reported a 23 per cent fall in profits. Moreover, it is struggling to meet
Bank of Spain demands that it reduce its exposure in industry to 40 per cent
of equity and, later, to 20 per cent.
At the moment, Banesto's exposure in industry is some 52 per cent of equity
and it was always going to have to correct this by either withdrawing from
industry or increasing capital. It is now doing both. Banesto officials say
the group will continue to shed industrial assets  - a policy JP Morgan will
probably have insisted on for its Corsair investors.
And, on closer scrutiny, Banesto's bad debts turn out to be covered better
than is the case at any big Spanish bank, apart from Banco Santander.
Moreover, the group's profits fall disguised a healthy profit rise in the
core banking business. And even critics acknowledge that Banesto has the
best electronic information systems of any Spanish bank. As cost control
becomes a serious factor in Spanish bank profitability, Mr Conde's planning
might begin to pay its way.
A Pta53bn flood of new cash would go a long way towards solving the capital
squeeze that dogs Banesto year after year. But, in order to place himself
and the bank well within the Bank of Spain's capital requirements on
industrial holdings, Mr Conde still has to see through the sale of a
regional banking affiliate, Banco de Madrid, to Deutsche Bank. Banesto is
said to be asking about Pta60bn for the bank. The Deutsche Bank has
reportedly offered Pta40bn.
So there is still some way to go. The Germans, who need to grow their
Spanish operation away from Catalonia, could still be tempted by other
targets. But the point now is that, assuming the rights issue goes well, Mr
Conde can stop running to his appointments. With the JP Morgan deal, things
may be coming right and even the sceptics are impressed.
'We are all looking for the catch,' said Mr Frederick Artessani, of brokers
Benito y Monjardin, 'but we can't seem to find one.'

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Regulator probes debt links in
Bronfman group
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S financial services regulator has asked banks, trust companies and
insurers to provide full details of their exposure to the vast industrial
and financial empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family.
The request, made earlier this week, comes amid uncertainty in financial
markets about the ability of companies in the intertwined Bronfman group to
withstand recent problems at Bramalea, a property developer, and Royal
Trust, Canada's second biggest trust company.
The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions described the
request as 'a monitoring activity which should not be construed to shock'.
The information, which must be provided by today, will be confidential.
Mr Bob Harding, president of Hees International Bancorp, the group's
merchant banking arm, said yesterday that the superintendent's request 'is
not something that's troublesome to us. We're financed through independent
public companies'.
According to analysts, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and
Toronto-Dominion Bank have the heaviest exposure to Bronfman companies.
The group has not disclosed the extent of its borrowings or off-balance
sheet financing. However, banks have stressed that the bulk of their
outstanding loans are to publicly-listed operating companies, such as
Noranda, the resources group, John Labatt, the brewer and Bramalea and
Trizec, the two real estate developers.
Some banks have announced write-downs on their loans to Bramalea, which
filed for bankruptcy protection last December with debts of CDollars 5bn
(USDollars 3.9bn). Royal Trust is seeking an infusion of equity. However,
outsiders concern centres on the Bronfmans' inner holding companies, such as
Hees International Bankcorp, Edper Enterprises and Pagurian. In response to
market nervousness, these companies have wound down virtually all their
commercial paper programmes.
Noranda moved earlier this week to insulate itself from concerns about the
strength of the rest of the Bronfman group by raising almost CDollars 1bn
from the sale by instalments of its 49 per cent stake in MacMillan Bloedel,
the Vancouver-based forestry company.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck unveils shake-up
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WALL Street reacted with enthusiasm yesterday to further evidence that
Sears, Roebuck, long-regarded as the sleeping giant of US retailing, has
woken up and is ready to fight to regain market share.
Yesterday, the company revealed details of its restructuring plans,
including a Dollars 4bn five-year capital expenditure for its stores and a
58.6 per cent cut in debt and deposits.
Sears has become uncharacteristically responsive to charges that it has
neglected its retail operations. Over the last five months it has brought in
a new head of retailing and announced plans to sell its loss-making
catalogue business and spin off much of its non-retailing operations.
As if to emphasise its renewed focus on retailing, the thrust of yesterday's
analysts' meeting centred on upgrading about 500 of its 800 US stores.
Mr Arthur Martinez, the former finance director of Saks Fifth Avenue who
took the helm of Sears' retail operations in October, stressed the need to
shift Sears's retail strategy from a national approach to a regional
approach.
'We believe we have the best retail store locations at major regional malls
in the country, which offer us tremendous growth potential. While a
considerable amount of work has been done in our stores in recent years,
much more needs to be done and at an accelerated pace,' Mr Martinez said. He
is credited with shutting Sears's loss-making catalogue business. Sears
plans to spend about Dollars 4bn upgrading its US stores over the next five
years.
Mr Edward Brennan, chairman and chief executive, said the company expected
the share issue of 20 per cent of its Dean Witter Financial Services
subsidiary to be priced and completed by the end of the month, slightly
ahead of schedule. The level of interest in Dean Witter is 'about as high as
one could hope', he said.
The spin-off of the remainder of Dean Witter, which includes the profitable
securities brokerage and Discover credit card unit, is to be completed by
the end of the year.
Sears expected cumulative proceeds of about Dollars 3bn from the Dean Witter
share issue and spin-off, a 20 per cent share issue of its Allstate
insurance subsidiary and the sale of its Coldwell Banker property broker.
Sears shares rose Dollars 1 5/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 51 5/8 . The
stock was trading at around Dollars 41 before the demerger was announced in
September.
Sears said it was cutting its quarterly dividend to 40 cents from 50 cents
to reflect its strategic repositioning. It predicted an 11.5 per cent
decline in revenue to Dollars 52.3bn after the repositioning, a 29.6 per
cent drop in assets to Dollars 79.8bn and a drop in debt and deposits to
Dollars 15.4bn.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Havas reveals surprise 24% drop
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVAS, one of France's most powerful media and leisure groups, yesterday
revealed a surprise fall in net profits of 24 per cent to FFr820m (Dollars
150m) last year from FFr1.03bn in 1991.
Havas, which owns a number of prominent French businesses including the
Eurocom advertising group and a chain of regional newspapers, managed to
lift sales by almost 6 per cent last year with turnover rising to FFr28bn
from 26.4bn in 1991.
Mr Pierre Dauzier, Havas's chairman, told shareholders in December that the
group would produce static profits in 1992.
Difficult economic conditions have affected Havas's travel interests as well
as its advertising activities, which were destabilised by restructuring
after a series of acquisitions and by the impact of le loi Sapin, the
government's new legislation on media buying.
In spite of the decline in its 1992 profits Havas has decided to maintain
its dividend at FFr12 a share.
It has agreed terms to extend the contracts between its Information et
Publicite subsidiary and Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Teleffusion, the
broadcasting group in which it is indirectly a substantial shareholder, for
a further five years.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Unitas pre-tax loss deepens to
FM2.7bn

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITAS, Finland's second-largest banking group, yesterday disclosed a
FM2.7bn (Dollars 499.3m) pre-tax loss for 1992 and warned that it would
record a heavy deficit this year.
A tripling of credit losses to FM3.3bn from FM1.1bn was the main reason for
the deterioration on the FM128m loss in 1991. The group's net income from
financing operations shrank 17 per cent to FM1.89bn due to an increase in
non-performing loans.
At the year end, the group's non-performing loan portfolio stood at FM8.3bn,
or 6.14 per cent of total loans outstanding, compared with FM5.7bn in 1991.
There will be no dividend.
Unitas, which is the holding company for the Union Bank of Finland, drew
some comfort from the fact that its loss was slightly lower than predicted
at the eight-month stage, as it benefited from a drop in interest rates and
a rise in equity prices over the last four months. It cut operating expenses
during the year by FM185m, or 7 per cent.
In spite of the overall loss the group's capital adequacy ratio stood at
11.1 per cent at the year end, compared with 10.3 per cent a year earlier.
This reflected the impact of the group's August convertible bond issue and a
FM1.7bn government preference capital injection.
Unitas said its position should be strong enough for it to be able to get
through 1993 without support from the government guarantee fund.
However, it was looking at the possibility of raising new capital, possibly
by launching a US preference share issue, and said it may seek a government
guarantee for this.
The group said its 1993 result would be 'heavily negative' because of the
continuing Finnish recession. But there were some optimistic signs and the
group was hoping its result would not deteriorate any further.
'The drop in interest rates will improve operating conditions and the
unwinding of risks and losses relating to certain equity holdings last year
will have a similar impact,' said Mr Vesa Vainio, Unitas chief executive. He
added that the group could expect to benefit from cost-cutting.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KONE saw profits after financial items rise 7 per cent to FM478.9m (Dollars
89m) in 1992, thanks to a recession-resistant performance from its core
elevator activities.
Sales expanded 12 per cent to FM11.3bn, reflecting acquisitions and the
weakening of the Finnish markka. Dividends are unchanged at FM9 per A share
and FM10 per B share. Earnings per share rose to FM51.45 from FM43.88.
The group said demand for elevators and cranes continued to decline in
Europe, its main market, and North America's share of overall business was
down. But maintenance business grew worldwide and new equipment sales
benefited from strong growth in Asia Pacific.
Kone's elevators business lifted sales to FM8.3bn from FM7.1bn, with
maintenance business, which is more recession proof than new business,
accounting for as much as 60 per cent of the total.
Kone said it had decided to de-list its shares from the Stockholm stock
exchange because of low volume.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLEIAD Real Estate is selling a newly-built complex in central Brussels for
SKr3bn (Dollars 415m) in what it claims is one of Europe's largest single
property transactions. The buyer is the Belgian telephone company Belgacom,
which will be able to gather its various operations under one roof.
The complex, known as Tours Pleiad, is situated at the Gare du Nord and
comprises 110,000 sq metres of office space in two 29-story buildings and
one 7-storey pavilion.
Mr Per Mellander, Pleiad chief executive, said: 'We're delighted at having
been able to close this large deal, given today's tight real-estate market
in Europe.'
He said the complex's central location, with good transport links, and its
'high Scandinavian quality' had been crucial factors in clinching the sale.
Pleiad was set up in 1989 by five investors, comprising the motor vehicle
group Volvo and four Swedish pension and insurance groups. Its property and
development project portfolio totals SKr7bn.

FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney sees large deficit

EURO Disney, which operates the FFr4.2bn (Dollars 768m) EuroDisneyland theme
park near Paris, has warned shareholders it would make a substantial loss
this year.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, who last month took over as chairman, told an
investors' meeting in Paris that he expected to see an improvement in the
second half of the year, but that Euro Disney would stay in the red for the
full year.
Euro Disney, which made a pre-tax loss of FFr339m in its last financial year
to September 30, has announced a deficit of FFr492m for the first quarter of
this year.
Mr Bourguignon said it was on course for slightly worse losses in the second
quarter. When asked whether Euro Disney would be profitable in the second
half he replied: 'The third quarter - I don't know. The fourth quarter - I
hope so.'
Since its opening last spring, EuroDisneyland has been hit by shortfalls in
attendance and merchandise revenue due to the economic environment and
strength of the French franc against other European currencies. The group is
burdened by high financing costs after being forced to postpone its property
development programme because of the Paris property slump.
Analysts estimated that Euro Disney would attract 10m-10.5m visitors by the
end of its first year. This compared to Euro Disney's forecast of 11.5m
visitors. Mr Richard Simon, analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York, expected
Euro Disney to produce a net loss of 'at least FFr750m' this year.

FT  12 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Welcome for BP figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOURTH-quarter results at the top end of market expectations, an impressive
post-results meeting between British Petroleum management and oil sector
analysts, and a fresh wave of US buying drove BP shares up to their best
level for 12 months.
The stock, after 20m shares traded, closed 11 1/2 , or 4.3 per cent, higher
at 277 1/2 p, easily outpacing a generally buoyant oil sector, itself up 2
per cent, and the wider market, where the FT-SE 100 finished 0.6 per cent
ahead.
Specialists said Mr David Simon, who took over the role of chief executive
last summer, delivered a very impressive performance, telling analysts that
BP was meeting its recovery plan targets and that there were no plans for a
rights issue until the group had reached its target of profits of Pounds
500m a quarter. Although much of yesterday's buying was again US-sourced, UK
institutions were also said to have been picking up the stock to reduce
their underweight positions.
Some analysts, however, remain cautious about BP's rehabilitation. Mr Keith
Morris at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken said 'BP is a recovery story for 1994, not
1993', while long-time bear Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull, pointing
out that gearing remained around 100 per cent, said: 'There is a surfeit of
enthusiasm over experience; they are far too expensive.'
Rank gloomy
A gloomy outlook from Rank Organisation during separate presentations to two
broking houses did little to help the shares, which fell back in thin
trading. Rank management was said to be giving no chance of recovery in the
leisure sector in 1993, with an upturn not seen until the final quarter of
1994. The remarks were considered pessimistic even by Rank's cautious
reputation in the market and the shares fell 17 to 689p.
However, hints that Rank would consider eventually exiting from its joint
venture with Xerox brought some cheer, as did brighter trading news on the
US, according to analysts.
Trafalgar cash call
Shares in Trafalgar House, the construction, property and shipping group,
fell sharply as the market reacted to the long-awaited rights issue, a cut
in the dividend and a warning of further property write-downs.
The market had anticipated the one-for-two rights issue to raise Pounds
204.5m, but the warning on further property writedowns took many by
surprise. Trafalgar also announced a cut in the dividend from 6p to 3.25p.
Dealers rushed to sell the stock and by the close, turnover had risen to
48m, boosted by programme trading, and the shares fell 12 to 76 1/2 p.
Mr Leslie Kent at agency broker Carr Kitcat said: 'The company has a huge
credibility problem but there remains much potential in the group. It is up
to management to restore that credibility and potential but that will take a
long time.'
Reuters rebounds
News and information group Reuters recovered 28 to 1344p as analysts'
interpretations of the company's full-year results reached clients. The buy
argument is exemplified by SG Warburg, which published an overview at the
end of last week. The UK investment bank argues that at 1390p Reuters was on
a 1993 price/earnings relative of 145 to 150 and a price relative target of
110, which would push them to 1430p. That target looked more achievable on
Tuesday, before the price tumbled 66p.
Yesterday, NatWest Securities advised clients to avoid buying until the
stock hit 1250p. Nikko advised selling: the Japanese house said earnings per
share growth will be held back by lower interest rates and hedging last
year.
Suggestions that Lloyds Bank's preliminary figures may be accompanied by a
full-scale bid for another of the UK banks continued to drive TSB and
Standard Chartered shares sharply higher.
TSB attracted exceptionally heavy activity, with 10m shares traded in the
cash market and the equivalent of 5.1m shares dealt in the stock options.
But there was scepticism about the likelihood of a Lloyds bid, with TSB
shares underperforming the sector and the market and closing only a penny
higher at 172p.
Standard Chartered, where Lloyds retains a 4.7 per cent shareholding after
its unsuccessful bid in the mid-1980s, closed 14 higher at 645p, after 650p.
Lloyds, expected to reveal a 10 per cent increase in the dividend total,
rose sharply to end 13 stronger at 528p.
Royal Insurance appreciated 15 to 288p on 5.8m traded, with the market
increasingly of the view that a rights issue is unlikely in the short term.
Commercial Union closed at 600p ex-rights, with the nil-paid ending the
session at 90p premium.
The pharmaceuticals sector showed strong gains yesterday, reflecting
'bottom-fishing' in the US. Goldman Sachs was on the bid and Glaxo, the
hardest hit in recent weeks, was the biggest gainer in percentage terms in
the FT-SE 100 Index. The shares jumped 31 to 696p on heavy turnover of 10m.
Meanwhile, SmithKline Beecham improved 20 to 466p in the 'A's and 17 to 409p
in the Units. Wellcome raced through the 900p level to close 20 better at
913p.
Rothmans International 'B' rose 13 to 599p after the company said it has
begun talks to set up a regional holding company in the Far East.
First-quarter figures at the top of the range of analysts' estimates helped
industrial gases group BOC rise 7 to 746p. Hoare Govett's chemicals analyst
Mr Martin Evans has maintained his full-year forecast of Pounds 380m and
continues to see the shares as undervalued.
BT settled 3 1/2 firmer at 411 1/2 p after the third-quarter figures. Mr Jim
Ross, telecoms analyst at Hoare Govett, said the slow steady upturn in
inland call volumes was 'a good backdrop for the flotation of BT later this
year; the shares have further to go'.
A strong buy recommendation from Goldman Sachs left BPB 7 higher at 216p. Mr
Mike Betts, building analyst at Goldman, said BPB's profits should grow
rapidly, due to increases in plasterboard prices, both those already
announced and those expected in the future.
Dull retail stocks were enlivened by the debut of Motor World Group, which
saw 5.8m shares placed at 210p and was quickly marked up to close 65 ahead
at 275p. Dealers said the group had excited interest from private clients
following a series of presentations.
Burton Group eased 1 1/2 to 69 1/2 p as agency broker Cazenove was said to
have crossed lines of 4m and 1m shares at 70p. Turnover reached 21m. Alexon,
where bid stories were again heard, added 3 at 85p.
Very heavy turnover in Asda was seen as investors speculated on the value of
the nil-paid shares. They closed steady at 5p, while the ordinary edged a
halfpenny forward to 58 1/2 p in turnover of 47m. VAT and competition
worries again dampened enthusiasm for the leading food retailers.
Although not a fund-raising event, hotel group Forte's Pounds 200m debenture
issue was thought good for sentiment and the shares added 4 at 190p.
Paper company Arjo Wiggins Appleton bounced 6 1/2 to 168 1/2 p after 40 per
cent stakeholder Saint-Louis, of France, said the group had provisional 1992
turnover of Pounds 2.57bn, compared with Pounds 2.49bn in 1991.
British Steel had a busy session boosted by a recommendation from SG Warburg
and volume rose to 15m as the shares hardened 2 to 78p. Warburg was,
however, reported to be negative on IMI and the stock declined 12 to 268p.
Personal care and footwear group Peter Black dipped 3 to 170p as it was
announced that two shareholders had sold stock and now owned less than 3 per
cent of the equity.

FT  12 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Blue chips drive the market forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market yest-erday regained some of the confidence so badly
bruised over the two previous trading days and share prices closed very
firmly after a well-traded session. The latest fund-raising moves, a
well-heralded Pounds 204m rights issue from Trafalgar House and Pounds 200m
in debentures from Forte, were taken calmly and there was relief that
British Petroleum, reporting satisfactory trading news, made no call on
shareholders.
Traders pointed out that the two-week equity trading account ends tonight
with share profits still in place; further demand for stock to meet selling
commitments taken on Tuesday and Wednesday could help the market this
morning.
Heavy buying from across the Atlantic for the pharmaceutical stocks which
have been badly hit in recent sessions provided the driving force behind the
blue chip sectors. A large buy programme by a UK house was identified.
Oil shares, too, made good progress following the BP statement; although UK
funds remain cautious towards BP shares, they are wary of selling while US
investors show increasing confidence in the stock.
An early gain of 13 points on the Footsie proved more than the market would
allow, and the advance was trimmed briefly as the rights issue from
Trafalgar was absorbed. The stock index futures sector provided a lacklustre
guide in early deals.
However, the market began to move forward as the drug stocks responded to
demand for the sector in New York overnight. The Footsie was quickly ahead
by more than 24 points at 2,840.7. The market remained firm for the rest of
the day. But in spite of a firm start to the new Wall Street session, when
the Dow Average added 22 points in early trading, London closed just below
the day's best levels.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index at 2,834.3 for a gain of 17.9
on the day. Investors were waiting cautiously for reports of the speech in
Germany by Mr Eddie George, governor-designate of the Bank of England. But
his warning that there is little room for further adjustment on domestic
interest rates came after the London equity market had closed for the day.
The focus on the blue chip pharmaceuticals, where Glaxo stood out strongly,
took some interest away from the second liners. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index
firmed only 4.6 to 3,006.5. However, dealing in second-line issues made up
about 63 per cent of the day's total Seaq business of 889.4m shares. Retail,
or customer, business has remained high this week and on Wednesday returned
a value figure of Pounds 1.27bn.
The strength of the pharmaceutical and oil issues also outweighed, in index
terms, the continued setback in several domestically orientated sectors.
Food retailers continued to signal concern over suggestions of adverse tax
developments ahead in next month's Budget speech from the UK chancellor of
the exchequer.
The market's chief preoccupation, however, remained the heavy flow of
company news now looming over investors. The game of 'spot the rights issue'
has been joined by the game of 'spot the bid story', and the market was
buzzing last night with hints that a large corporate dev-elopment will
shortly be announced in the banking and financial sector.

FT  12 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures had a volatile session in which fears of further rights
issues alternated with bid speculation in the banking sector, writes Joel
Kibazo.
An initial retreat in the March contract on the FT-SE after opening at 2,835
was brought about by news of the Trafalgar House rights issue. That was
quickly shrugged off and March reversed direction, pulled forward by the
cash market. But it ran into another bout of selling at mid-morning as bid
talk and speculation of further rights issues again went round the market.
However, buying from a leading US house sent March into positive territory
again and this time it touched the day's high of 2,842. Then, weakness in
sterling led to further selling that was encouraged by the early poor
performance on Wall Street.
March finished at 2,834, up 7 from the previous close and around 3 points
above the underlying cash market, after turnover of 8,480 contracts.
In traded options, most of the day's activity centred on the stock options.
Bid specu-lation in TSB continued and it was the most actively dealt option
with a total of 5,159 lots.
It was followed by Cadbury-Schweppes with 1,159 lots transacted and Glaxo
with 1,405. Trafalgar House, on announcing its rights issue yesterday, was
also busy. Total option market turnover came to 29,205 contracts.

signals

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEL AVIV equities, on a spectacular rising curve for more than a year,
tumbled by more than 4 per cent yesterday after signals from the Bank of
Israel that it wants to cool the market, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem.
It was the second downward lurch this week, following a 2 per cent slide on
Tuesday after Mr Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the central bank, referred
to the market as a 'financial bubble'.
After recovering on Wednesday, the market went sharply back into reverse
yesterday on further reports that the Bank of Israel was seeking to curb
bank lending to mutual funds for stock purchases, a major source of
liquid-ity during the recent bull market. The main index of the 100 most
traded companies dropped 4.16 per cent to 206.08 in turnover of Shk250m
(Dollars 90m).
Last year, the market raced ahead by almost 100 per cent in shekel terms and
by around 75 per cent in dollar terms. The 100 index ended 1992 at 195.98.
Many analysts have been warning that the market, with an average prospective
price-earnings ratio of around 23, is due for a correction.

FT  12 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow reflects strong gains on
jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US EQUITY markets put in a solid performance yesterday, aided by strong
demand for cyclical stocks, although all the major indices ended below the
day's highs because of late selling, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 10.27 up at 3,422.69, after
standing almost 30 points ahead at one stage. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was
a net 1.43 firmer at 447.66, while the Nasdaq composite gained just 0.86 on
balance at 695.88. Trading volume on the New York SE was 257m shares.
Advances in overseas equity markets set the tone for a strong New York
opening, but it was not until mid-morning that demand really began to pick
up. Sentiment was boosted by good news from the jobs area, where weekly
unemployment insurance claims fell 12,000 in the last week of January
(although this was partially offset by weak retail sales data), and by a
strong rally in the bond market, which responded to an unexpectedly
successful afternoon auction of new 30-year bonds.
Corporate earnings continued to affect prices. General Motors was the day's
main story, with the stock moving forward Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 40 1/2 in
a volume of 11.3m shares after the car manufacturer reported a Dollars
23.5bn loss for 1992. This was primarily the result of extra-ordinary
charges related to government mandated changes in accounting standards.
The other two big car issues were also firmer: Chrysler put on Dollars 5/8
at Dollars 40 7/8 in busy trading after Salomon Brothers, the securities
house, raised its earnings estimates for 1993, 1994 and 1995. Ford, which
announced that it was to launch a credit card for customers in conjunction
with Citibank, climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 50 3/4 .
IBM declined Dollars 1 to Dollars 51 1/8 in volume of 3.1m shares after
announcing plans to increase the number of jobs it proposes to cut in North
America.
Sears Roebuck moved ahead Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 51 5/8 as it unveiled a
five-year Dollars 4bn programme to upgrade its stores and announced details
of a plan to complete an initial public offering of stock in its Dean Witter
securities brokerage and credit card subsidiary.
Cummins Engine advanced Dollars 3 to Dollars 84 1/2 on reporting strong
fourth-quarter earnings as the company continues to recover from a string of
losses.
Canada
TORONTO closed steady after heavy trading, but managed to extend its streak
to nine straight sessions of gains.
The TSE 300 index edged ahead just 0.2 to 3,443.2, although overall rises
outnumbered declines by 348 to 282. Volume came to 52.8m shares valued at
CDollars 491.3m.
The gold shares group, which had advanced sharply in the previous two
sessions on the rising bullion price, suffered a setback of 1.7 per cent as
spot gold in New York shed USDollars 1 to USDollars 331.45 an ounce.

FT  12 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Campaign promises
encourage Australia to hit six-month high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOKYO WAS closed for a national holiday but other Pacific Rim markets were
generally firmer.
AUSTRALIA climbed to a six-month high, drawing encouragement from employment
data and campaign promises from both of the main political parties to help
the corporate sector.
Strong demand from domestic and overseas investors propelled the All
Ordinaries index above the 1,600 level, but late profit-taking pulled prices
off their highs. The index closed 8.5 higher at 1,599.1 in turnover of
ADollars 342.1m.
More than 9.4m Pioneer shares were traded following the resignation of the
chief executive officer. The stock added a cent at ADollars 2.32, with
investors taking the view that it has been an underperformer recently.
HONG KONG remained positive, with investors encouraged by the successful
flotation of Denway, which saw its HKDollars 402m share offer oversubscribed
by some 700 times. The Hang Seng index ended 21.45 ahead at 5,857.00 but
turnover was low at HKDollars 1.9bn.
Some analysts commented that slightly better than expected December trade
figures also helped sentiment. In pre-listing trade, Denway was quoted at
HKDollars 3.50, up from HKDollars 3.00. HSBC Holdings rose 50 cents to
HKDollars 61.50.
BANGKOK gave up some of an early advance but the SET index still managed to
edge 1.08 ahead to 991.21. Some analysts expect the index to breakthrough
the 1,000 level today. Turnover was Bt12bn.
Bank shares were in demand. Bangkok Bank put on Bt2 at Bt135. Thai Farmers
Bank rose Bt28 to Bt928, Krung Thai Bank Bt4 to Bt404 and Bank of Ayudhya
Bt1 to Bt79.
MANILA adopted a positive tone and the composite index climbed 23.94 to
1,403.61, with mining issues leading the rise on the back of improved gold
prices.
Among blue chips, Philippine National Bank moved ahead 12 pesos to 245 pesos
and Manila Electric added 25 pesos at 220 pesos on rumours of a rights
issue.
SEOUL benefited from demand for financial issues and some other
large-capitalisation stocks, and the composite index firmed 4.35 to 681.60.
Turnover was Won654bn, up from Wednesday's Won597bn.
KUALA LUMPUR picked up as the government and the country's hereditary rulers
broke their deadlock over constitutional amendments. The composite index,
5.01 lower at midday, picked up to end 3.28 easier on balance at 635.34 in
turnover of some MDollars 633m.
SINGAPORE was weaker, while Rothmans Industries shares were suspended from
trading ahead of a company announcement. Rothmans Plc in London said that it
had begun talks with its divisions in Malaysia and Singapore which could
lead to a regional holding company.
The Straits Times Industrial index shed 4.43 to 1,621.47 in volume of 140.5m
shares, against 134.3m on Wednesday.
TAIWAN remained firm following Wednesday's announcement that Governor Lien
Chan was to be nominated as the next premier, so easing political worries.
The weighted index rose 43.33, or 1.2 per cent, to 3,621.43 in turnover of
TDollars 18.3bn, after the previous day's TDollars 32.7bn.
NEW ZEALAND was helped by strength in Fletcher Challenge, which advanced 6
cents to NZDollars 2.58. The NZSE-40 index gained 10.88 at 1,577.66.
BOMBAY eased back on profit-taking: the BSE index closed 26.29 down at
2,785.83.

FT  12 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Roller-coaster ride in Italian
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL trepidation in Italy, and French interest in the
recently-embattled Euro-equity stocks were the main features in bourses
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN calmed itself at the start of the new trading day with domestic
institutions and overseas investors apparently ready to put Wednesday's
traumas behind them.
But prices again turned down as the market was convulsed by rumours that
Prime Minister Giuliano Amato was under investigation in the political
corruption scandal that forced Mr Claudio Martelli to resign as justice
minister.
A firm denial of the story by the Milan magistrate who heads the
investigation enabled prices to pick up from their lows, but it did not
overcome renewed nervousness in the market and the Comit index fell again,
closing 8.63 lower at 487.52.
The roller-coaster ride taken by the Fiat share price tracked the day's
political events. The shares picked up to an early high of L4,625 before
easing back to fix L10 firmer at L4,591. In after-hours trading, the price
dipped to a low of L4,460 at the height of the Amato rumours before pulling
back up to L4,520.
State groups facing privatisation were also hit by the spectre of political
instability that could put the government's programme in jeopardy. Credito
Italiano fell L200 or 6 1/2 per cent to fix at L2,853.
PARIS recovered the 1,900 level with interest centred on Euro Disney and
Eurotunnel, the latter having shown strong volume all week. The CAC-40 index
closed up 12.20 at 1,905.27, after a day's high of 1,920.07, in good
turnover of FFr3.5bn.
Euro Disney attracted investors in spite of comments from the group that it
expects a 'substantial loss' for fiscal 1992/93. However, some analysts said
that many institutions were now looking further ahead and saw the group
benefiting from lower European interest rates. The shares rose FFr1.40 to
FFr76.00, but off the day's high of FFr77.90.
Eurotunnel gained FFr1.25 to FFr38.15 in good volume.
Bancaire came off early lows after reporting a 57 per cent decline in 1992
net attributable profit to finish up FFr12.50 at FFr462.70 as investors
turned their attention to the current year.
The financial sector was generally firmer on expectations of privatisations,
should there be a change of government next month. Societe Generale gained
FFr14 to FFr630, Paribas rose FFr8.30 to FFr406.50 and Suez advanced FFr2.30
to FFr286.90.
FRANKFURT edged up to its highest close since last July 21, the DAX ending
1.24 better at 1,651.05. Of the 30 DAX shares, 15 were higher by Thursday's
closing, while 14 were lower and one was unchanged.
Turnover was DM6.5bn down from Wednesday's DM8.2bn. The DAX got its impetus
largely from carmakers, engineers, and steels, all of which have seen
downbeat comment from analysts in recent days.
As BMW rose DM4 to DM514.50, and Volkswagen DM2.40 to DM294.90, James Capel
was sending out a morning letter which commented on the collapse in European
January car registrations: while the sector has outperformed since
end-December, it said, trading conditions in the automotive industry are
deteriorating faster that any time during the current recession.
Engineers included a DM8.50 gain to DM779 for Linde while steels saw Thyssen
DM3.20 better at DM180.20.
According to Mr John Longhurst of James Capel, all empirical evidence
suggests that although the fall in foreign demand for capital goods is
showing signs of stabilising at a lower level, domestic demand - where
margins are high - continues to deteriorate, and rapidly.
MADRID returned to the upgrade on growing expectations of an interest rate
cut, the general index closing 3.28 higher at 237.54. Turnover was around
Pta28bn and gains included Pta35 to Pta1,355 for Telefonica and, among the
debt-burdened electrical utilities, Endesa Pta205 higher at Pta4,220.
Banesto reversed on consideration of its rights issue terms, losing Pta120
at Pta2,315.
ZURICH struggled to find direction before some late buying took the SMI
index 7.1 higher to 2,127.9.
AMSTERDAM improved as investors again bought Royal Dutch and Akzo. The oil
group, up Fl 1.30 at Fl 156.80, has been helped by speculation ahead of
Saturday's meeting of Opec. Akzo rose another Fl 3.10 to Fl 149.50 on a
number of buy recommendations.
ISTANBUL was active in the electricity sector and the 75-share index closed
above the 5,000 level, up 190 at 5,133.

FT  12 FEB 93 / World Stock Market: Strong January on Santiago market reform
 -Leslie Crawford details reaction to the widening of institutional
investment options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Santiago's stock exchange soared in January, on the wings of proposed
capital market reforms which promise to broaden the investment options of
Chile's private pension funds and insurance companies.
These institutions are the biggest participants in the market. The IPSA
index of the 40 most traded shares rose by 11.7 per cent, in one month
almost doubling the modest price gains registered in the whole of 1992.
Trading was also unusually heavy in second-tier stocks, as retail investors
reacted to the news that pension funds would soon be authorised to invest in
more than 100 new companies. At present, the equity portfolios of pension
funds are restricted to 40 blue chips.
As speculators snapped up shares in these little-traded companies, the
general share price index, or IGPA, rose by 16.6 per cent. In the last week
of January, average daily market turnover more than doubled to Dollars
28.2m. On one day, turnover on the stock exchange floor and the electronic
bourse notched up a record Dollars 45.5m.
In spite of some profit-taking at the end of January, most analysts expected
the stock exchange, or Bolsa, to remain steady during February. Earlier this
week the IPSA, returned to 100 each December 31, had eased to 111.06, from
111.7 on January 29.
The proposed capital markets reforms were leaked throughout the month,
before being unveiled finally by Mr Alejandro Foxley, the finance minister,
on January 23.
The reforms will allow private pension funds (AFPs) and insurance companies,
which manage Dollars 15bn worth of funds, to broaden and diversify their
equity portfolios. They will also be allowed to invest in new financial
instruments such as convertible bonds, revenue bonds, foreign exchange,
interest rate and equity index futures. AFPs will be free to acquire shares
and corporate bonds abroad. At present, their foreign investment is
restricted to AAA-rated bank debt and gilt-edged securities.
AFPs welcomed the proposed reforms as an opportunity to diversify their
portfolios and reduce risk. Their equity investments are currently heavily
concentrated in the privatised electricity and telecommunications sectors.
This over-exposure was making both the authorities and pension fund managers
feel uncomfortable.
Although the new law is not expected to enter the statute books until June,
Mr Mario Lobo, an investment banker with Celfin Consultants, says the
announcement was 'the psychological boost the market needed to consolidate
other good news'. This includes some excellent corporate results following a
year in which the Chilean economy grew by 9.7 per cent - one of its best
ever performances.
Endesa SA, the privatised utility, said 1992 had been the best year in its
history, with profits up 30 per cent to Dollars 260m. Endesa is now planning
to raise in excess of Dollars 50m on the international bond markets to
finance acquisitions in Argentina and Peru, and to build a Dollars 450m
hydro-electric dam in southern Chile.
Vineyard stocks are also bubbly after wine and champagne exporters increased
their foreign shipments by 41.7 per cent last year to Dollars 119.2m. The
winemakers Santa Carolina, Santa Rita and San Pedro have all outperformed
the share price index.
New stock market favourites are emerging as investors realign their
portfolios in anticipation of the capital market reforms. The top performers
in January were the metals refinery Elecmetal and the bottling plant
Cristales, both up by around 62 per cent.
Mr Antonio Cruz, manager of the two Midland Bank foreign investment funds in
Chile, sees the greatest growth potential occurring in medium-sized
industrial and consumer product companies. 'These companies are making large
investments to meet growing demand,' he says. Cement plants, for example,
are working at full capacity due to the construction boom in Santiago.

FT  12 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures had another mild fall yesterday as the pound remained weak
on the foreign exchanges, raising speculation that the UK government would
find it difficult to cut interest rates again, writes James Blitz.
The UK currency flirted with its historic low against the D-Mark throughout
yesterday and this helped to depress sentiment in trading on the March
futures contract.
The onset of yesterday's keynote speech by Mr Eddie George, the
Governor-elect of the Bank of England, also saw selling of the March
contract. Mr George is reputed to take a hard-line view about the need to
combat inflation, raising speculation that he would warn against hasty
interest rate cuts.
Both factors helped to push the March short sterling contract down 8 basis
points at one stage yesterday, to a low of 94.07 in the mid-afternoon. The
contract finished at 94.08, at which level it prices three-month money at
5.92 per cent in UK Budget week next month.
Dealers remained divided as to whether the contract could fall much further
from these levels. Some continued to feel that it was a good buy, with good
reasons to expect rates in both the UK and Europe to fall in the near term.
However, a London-based dealer suggested that the contract could easily
reach convergence with yesterday's closing level for three-month money,
which yesterday was 6 1/8 per cent. In his view, the pound's weakness made
another near-term cut in base rates unlikely.
Sentiment in the cash market was much easier after most of the Pounds 1.05bn
shortage forecast by the Bank of England in the morning was removed.
The March Euromark contract gained 7 basis points to close at 92.02,
following slight falls in the first two days of this week. In the German
cash market, call money rates of between 8.55 and 8.60 per cent were quoted
unchanged throughout the day.
The better tone in Germany could not lift spirits in French franc markets,
however. The Director of the French Bankers' Association said base rates may
have to rise if short-term interest rates remain high.
The March franc contract fell 2 basis points to a close of 88.54. Both
one-month and three-month French francs ended at around 12 per cent.

for final period
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO

<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck, the heavily loss-making US retailer, has cut its dividend
for the first time in 60 years, with a 10 cents a share cut in the
fourth-quarter payout to 40 cents, Reuter reports from Chicago.
On Tuesday the company reported a loss of Dollars 10.72 a share for 1992,
down from a profit of Dollars 3.71 the year before. Analysts said the widely
anticipated cut would save about Dollars 140m a year.
Sears said the move reflected the strategic repositioning of the company,
including the spin-off of Dean Witter, its securities brokerage and
investment banking unit and Discover, its credit card business, expected to
take place in the middle of 1993.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: French insurers' profits plunge
under pressure - How the fall in earnings might affect the prospects for
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MONTHS France's large insurance groups have made no secret of being
under pressure. But it was only on Tuesday when the usually optimistic Mr
Claude Bebear, chairman of Axa, addressed analysts in Paris that it was
clear just how heavy the pressure had been.
Axa, the second largest French insurer, not only announced a sharp fall in
net profits to about FFr1.5bn (Dollars 268m) in 1992 from FFr2.4bn the year
before. It also said that it was raising FFr3.65bn in a convertible-bond
issue to recapitalise Equitable Life, its US associate.
Later that day, Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), France's biggest single
insurer, revealed its 1992 net profits had plummeted to about FFr1.15bn,
from FFr3.8bn in 1991. Analysts are now steeled for more gloomy figures when
Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and the GAN Group publish their 1992
results.
French insurers are operating in intensely competitive conditions as the
economic slowdown is making it more difficult for them to pump up profits
with asset sales as they did in 1991, when all the 'big four' would
otherwise have been in the red.
These problems could scarcely have come at a worse time. France's insurance
industry has hit the doldrums just as the three state-controlled companies -
UAP, AGF and GAN - are preparing to be privatised by a future French
government after next month's elections.
Even the most optimistic French insurers are resigned to another set of
lack-lustre results this year. The economy is unlikely to show any signs of
recovery at least until the second half, assuming that the franc stabilises
and interest rates come down.
In the meantime, the industry faces the same problems that beset it last
year. Competition remains intense both in terms of the number of players in
the market and pressure on tariffs. The economic squeeze has produced a
predictable increase in the number of claims, including suspected false
claims, and continues to depress the value of the insurers' industrial
portfolios.
Moreover, the property market shows no sign of recovery. This affects the
insurers in two ways. First, they face another year of high provisions.
Second, their asset sales will again be too low to compensate for poor
operating profits and hefty provisions.
The Paris stock market is rife with rumours about the insurers selling
properties to each other, allegedly at inflated prices.
In the short term, this cushions them against the slump and helps prop up
the market. But, in the long term, they will have to carry those properties
on their books.
The industry's future is more reassuring. The FFr240bn life market should be
boosted by the forthcoming reform of French pensions, which is expected to
supplement the state system with private pension plans.
Meanwhile, competition appears to be easing in the FFr200m non-life sector
as the growth of the mutuelles, which sell insurance to specialist groups of
employees, peaks. There are also signs of tariffs rising in certain sectors,
notably motor insurance.
The general economic recovery should alleviate the pressure on the stock
market and on residential property - although it is expected to take at
least three years for the over-saturated commercial property market to
recover.
French insurers should also start to benefit from their international
expansion in the early 1990s.
Axa is expected to receive more substantial contributions from Equitable
Life in the US. AGF now owns a substantial stake in AMB, the German insurer,
after a complex transaction last year.
UAP has invested in Germany via its holding in Nordstern, although it is
smarting from its failure to buy a stake in Colonia from Victoire, the
insurance subsidiary of the Suez industrial group.
These developments should ensure that the large French insurers stabilise
profits this year and secure moderate growth next year. 'We can't hope for
much from any of the big French insurers in 1993,' said Mr Michael Huttner,
European insurance analyst at BNP Securities in London. 'But we can expect
to see a gradual recovery from 1994 onwards.'
The critical question is whether this improvement will come in time to
enable the next French government to sell all, or part, of its shares in
UAP, AGF and GAN.
All three are eager to enter the private sector, where they would be free to
raise capital from the markets and would not be barred, as state-controlled
companies, from investing in the US. The centre-right alliance, favoured to
win next month's poll, plans to privatise them as quickly as possible.
The consensus among analysts is that all three companies are saleable
despite their present problems. 'The market loves a recovery story,' said
one. 'The only problem for the French government is judging how the 1992 and
1993 figures will affect the price.'

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Gillette wins clearance from trade
secretary for Pounds 285m Parker Pen bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 285m bid for Parker Pen by Gillette, the US shaving and
toiletries manufacturer, was cleared yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
inquiry found that the deal would not operate against the public interest.
According to the MMC, Parker supplies about half the value of UK sales of
refillable pens, while the Waterman and Paper Mate brands, which Gillette
already owns, account for a further 7 per cent.
The MMC found that any attempt to exploit its position in the retail market
would be constrained by numerous competitors and the bargaining power of
larger retailers.
The MMC was concerned that consumers could be misled by retailers' use of
staff deployed by suppliers but not identified as such. Mr Hes-eltine said
the Office of Fair Trading would investigate.
The proposed Parker acquisition, agreed in September, is still being studied
in the US.

FT  11 FEB 93 / German union leaders call protests over steel job cuts
</HEADLINE>

TRADE union leaders in Germany called yesterday for mass protests by steel
workers, after reports that the newly-merged Krupp and Hoesch steel
companies plan to close down an entire plant in either Dortmund or Duisburg.
Union officials said that Mr Hans Wilhelm Grasshoff, chief executive of
Hoesch Stahl, told a meeting of union members at the Westfalenhutte plant
that company plans to cut monthly production capacity from 700,000 to
550,000 tonnes meant that an entire steel plant would have to close.
There was no formal confirmation last night from Hoesch Stahl, where a board
meeting was still in progress late into the evening.
The plan would be much more drastic than last week's joint announcement by
Krupp Stahl and Hoesch Stahl that one blast furnace would be closed down
temporarily because of the downturn in the steel market.
That proposal is for the furnace to shut down for five months. The
shut-down, beginning on March 1, will put 600 steel workers on short-time
working.
The growing backlash from the unions over a potential threat to as many as
25,000 steel jobs follows a call from the opposition Social Democrats (SPD)
in the German parliament for an emergency national congress of steelmakers,
unions, and central and state governments, to draft a plan of action to
tackle the growing crisis.
However, the steel industry in Germany has broadly welcomed the plan
proposed by the European Commission for an EC-wide response, including
capacity cuts in exchange for new state aid.
Mr Ruprecht Vondran, head of the German steel industry association, told an
emergency debate in the Bundestag yesterday that the proposals were close to
those put forward by the industry and the German parliament.
It was critical to see the final form which would emerge from negotiations
between the 12 member states.
He said the aim should be not merely to stop the slump in profits of
European steel-makers, but simultaneously to ensure a fair market for steel
products in the EC.
If the industry was expected to find a common way out of the crisis, then
all must operate on a clear legal basis, he added.
Subsidies to the industry had created a backlog of restructuring which would
be painful and costly to overcome.
The entire burden could not be put on the public purse, and the steelmakers
would have to pay for their own restructuring to a large extent, he said.
If one enterprise was expected to help its competitors to close down surplus
capacity, finance social programmes for redundant workers, or even create
alternative employment, it must be certain of being able to use higher
capacity itself in return, Mr Vondran said.
The industry must be protected from market dumping by competitors in eastern
Europe , and from producers who have been forced out of the US market by the
protectionist measures introduced by Washington.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand, the first western head of state to
visit Vietnam, yesterday urged President Bill Clinton to lift the US embargo
imposed on Hanoi in 1964, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
After a two-day visit to Hanoi, Mr Mitterrand described the embargo as 'an
anachronism'. Washington extended the embargo to all of Vietnam in 1975,
when Hanoi's communists defeated the US-backed Saigon government and
reunified the country.
Mr Mitterrand announced on Tuesday that France would double its 1992 aid to
Vietnam this year. France gave Vietnam Dollars 36m (Pounds 23.8m) in 1992.
Yesterday, he said seven top-level co-operation agreements had been signed
between the two countries.
Vietnam, hit three years ago by the suspension of Soviet aid and now starved
for capital, had approached France 'with outstretched hands', Mr Mitterrand
said.
He said it was appropriate for France, given its past ties with Vietnam, to
be the first western country to help it reintegrate into the world
community.
Mr Mitterrand yesterday visited Dien Bien Phu, where forces led by Gen Vo
Nguyen Giap defeated a key French army unit in 1954, thus bringing an end to
colonial rule.
Reuter adds: Alcatel of France yesterday signed an agreement with the
Vietnamese Post and Telecommunications Authority to create a digital
switching joint venture called Alcatel Network Systems Vietnam.

FT  11 FEB 93 / NBC admits rigging truck test: GM drops lawsuit after TV
network apologises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF America's best known television presenters, Ms Jane Pauley, took to
the screen on Tuesday night to deliver a grovelling apology on behalf of the
NBC network to General Motors, America's biggest carmaker.
NBC's admission of wrongdoing came just a day after GM launched a suit for
defamation against the network, which it said had rigged a broadcast test of
a GM truck to make it burst into flames during a collision.
In particular, GM said NBC had fitted small incendiary devices - boosters
for toy rockets - underneath the vehicle. The devices were detonated by
remote control, thus ensuring that any petrol spilt during the collision
would catch fire.
The current affairs programme Dateline NBC had aired pictures of the blaze
without telling its 11m viewers about the rockets.
Apologising to both GM and viewers, Ms Pauley said the crash demonstration
was inappropriate, the use of 'incendiary devices' was a 'bad idea from
start to finish', and that the public should have been told about the
devices. GM followed through by calling off its legal action.
GM's investigation began after a tip that the tests were rigged. The company
wrote to NBC seeking its co-operation and access to the two vehicles
involved, only one of which (a 1977 model) caught fire. NBC replied that the
pick-ups had been destroyed.
GM, however, scoured dumps in rural Indiana around the test site, found the
vehicles, and signs that the rocket devices had been taped to them. It also
uncovered photographic evidence of a remote-control device being used to set
off the explosions and puffs of smoke coming from beneath the vehicles just
before collision.
An X-ray of the 1977 vehicle's fuel tank showed this had not been pierced -
contrary to claims in the NBC programme. And by finding the previous owner
of the vehicle, GM established that it was fitted with a faulty fuel cap.
In other words, the fire set off by the explosive devices was fed by fuel
escaping from the vehicle's filler tube, when the fuel cap flew off in the
collision, and not from a ruptured tank.
But the clash between two of America's best-known household names will not
end here.
It strikes a severe blow to the credibility of NBC, which is already
struggling with a serious morale problem. Since its takeover by General
Electric in 1986, NBC has dropped from first to last in the ratings of
America's three networks. This latest blow comes on top of the recent loss
of its late-night talk-show host, Mr David Letterman, to rival CBS.
GE is believed to want to sell NBC and the GM debacle is likely to
strengthen its resolve.
The incident also underscores the dubious quality of some US investigative
television reporting, which often seems shallow in its analysis and
sensational in its treatment of facts.
Media analysts suggest standards have slipped over the past two decades as
networks have faced declining budgets and increased competition for viewers
from cable channels.
NBC said yesterday that from now on 'unscientific demonstrations' would have
no place in hard news stories at the network.
The apology also gives a boost to GM, which is struggling against a tide of
bad publicity over the safety of its C/K pick-up trucks built between 1973
and 1987. The fuel tanks on these pick-ups are located at the side, and
outside the main frame, which critics have alleged makes them particularly
vulnerable to fire when hit from the side.
Last week a jury in Atlanta, Georgia, found GM guilty of negligence in the
design of the trucks and ordered it to pay over Dollars 105m (Pounds 69.5m)
to the parents of a teenager killed during a accident involving a C/K. GM is
appealing.
Government regulators are investigating the safety of the vehicles, which GM
insists are no more dangerous than those of its rivals. If the regulators
disagree, they could order a recall of the estimated 4.7m trucks still on
the road for modification, which would cost GM hundreds of millions of
dollars and lay it open to more suits for crash damages.
GM's legal action demonstrates that the company will fight to defend its
pick-ups, and will not recall them unprompted.

<TEXT>
MILLICOM Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of the US communications group,
is likely to become the first telecommunications operator in the UK
authorised to offer entertainment services over a national network, Alan
Cane writes.
The company said yesterday that the government had provisionally agreed to
extend the scope of Millicom's proposed public telecoms licence to include
the delivery of radio and television programmes.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, said that such a
substantial change to the terms of the licence would require a further
period of public consultation.
The government made a clear distinction between carrying entertainment
services - within the scope of the proposed licence - and providing
programmes, which would require separate authorisation.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Record loss of Dollars 1.3bn at
Ford of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD'S European automotive operations made a record loss last year of
Dollars 1.3bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 1.079bn in 1991.
The loss was largely incurred by Ford's operations in Britain, including
Jaguar, the UK car maker.
The loss in Europe included a Dollars 419m one-off charge for restructuring,
while adverse currency fluctuations added exchange rate losses of more than
Dollars 200m.
Ford of Europe announced late last year that it was planning to cut more
than 10,000 jobs by the end of 1993.
The workforce of its European automotive operations, excluding Jaguar, had
already been cut by 19 per cent from 115,000 in 1990 to 93,000 late last
year and is set to fall to 83,000 by the end of 1993.
Jaguar, which was taken over by Ford at the end of 1989, said that its loss
last year was little changed under US accounting rules, at Dollars 394.9m,
compared with a loss of Dollars 402.2m in 1991.
Under UK accounting rules, the loss was cut to Pounds 189.5m (Dollars 286m)
from Pounds 226.2m a year earlier. The Jaguar UK workforce has also been
sharply reduced, to only 6,481 at the end of 1992 from 7,520 a year earlier
and 11,661 at the end of 1990.
Jaguar's retail sales worldwide fell last year by 12.4 per cent to 22,478.
This was the lowest level since 1982. Production dropped last year by 10.5
per cent to 20,593 - lowest since 1981.
The UK car maker is expecting some recovery in its fortunes this year,
however, with a forecast increase in sales of 25 per cent worldwide, led by
stronger demand in the US.
Jaguar sales in January were 25 per cent higher than a year ago, helped by a
30 per cent rise in its sales in the US, its most important market.
Mr David McCammon, Ford vice-president for finance in the US, said that most
of the group's European automotive losses stemmed from Ford of Britain and
from Jaguar.
Ford, the leader of the UK new car market, has suffered heavily during the
recession. Its UK sales fell again last year by 8.4 per cent, depressing its
UK market share to only 22.2 per cent, from 24.2 per cent a year earlier.
The loss of Dollars 1.3bn incurred last year by Ford's European automotive
operations, including Jaguar, followed a net loss of Dollars 1.079bn in
1991, and net profits of Dollars 145m in 1990 and Dollars 1.19bn in 1989.
The losses in Europe more than accounted for Ford's total automotive losses
outside the US last year of Dollars 1.1bn.
Ford's European car production fell by 6.9 per cent last year to 1,459,792,
although its output of light commercial vehicles rose by 9.5 per cent to
226,547, helped by the launch of the Fiesta Courier van.
The Ford group has fallen to fifth place in the west European new car
market.

<TEXT>
BROOKE TOOL Engineering (Holdings) yesterday announced a further step in its
programme of selling loss-making businesses with the disposal of Cardinal
Broach to management for Pounds 2.35m cash.
At the same time, the company reported a sharp increase in pre-tax losses,
from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 3.14m, for the 12 months to September 30.
Turnover was lower at Pounds 18.9m (Pounds 25.3m). Losses per share
increased to 7.3p (3.3p) and the final dividend is omitted. Last year only a
0.25p interim was paid.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 811,000) included a Pounds
503,000 loss attributable to Cardinal Broach, which makes broaching tools
and machines.
The 1991 figures included an extraordinary loss of Pounds 403,000 which has
been restated as an exceptional item in line with new accounting standards.
Mr Bernard Friend, chairman, said that the exceptionals covered measures to
reduce the cost base and eliminate loss-making activities. They included
redundancy payments and losses on disposals.
A number of loss-makers were sold during the year, realising about Pounds
1.4m.
Cardinal Broach represents the group's last connection with the design and
manufacture of capital equipment. Mr John Dashper, chief executive, said the
sale would allow the group to redirect resources into its remaining
businesses in domestic and export markets - which are showing signs of
improvement. It would also reduce group borrowings.
Mr Friend said that poor trading and redundancy costs had kept borrowings at
too high a level. Interest charges for the year took Pounds 811,000 (Pounds
968,000). The first quarter of the current year had not shown any
significant change in trading, but there were more recent signs of
improvement. Order books were stronger than at this time last year,
particularly in continental Europe and North America.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Ford loses Dollars 7.4bn after change in accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FORD Motor, the US carmaker, yesterday reported a Dollars 7.4bn (Pounds
4.9bn) loss for 1992, due largely to a Dollars 6.9bn non-cash charge for a
change in accounting principles but also a Dollars 419m fourth-quarter
charge for restructuring its European operations.
The accounting change involves retirees' health benefits and affects all US
companies. Ford's charge is one of the highest reported, but it will be
dwarfed today by a Dollars 20.8bn charge due to be announced by General
Motors.
For the fourth quarter, Ford announced a loss of Dollars 840m, or Dollars
1.85 a share, after taking the Dollars 419m charge for restructuring in
Europe, where it has been hit hard by recession and is cutting jobs
extensively.
The loss compared with red ink of Dollars 476m, or Dollars 1.03 a share last
time, and was struck on sales of Dollars 25.4bn, up from Dollars 21.98bn.
The group's full-year loss of Dollars 7.4bn, or Dollars 15.61 a share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 2.25bn, or Dollars 4.79 a share in 1991.
Excluding accounting changes, it lost Dollars 502m in 1992.
Ford's North American vehicle operations have been helped by a gradual
recovery in the market and Ford has been gaining market share.
It held 21.8 per cent of the car market in 1992, up 1.7 points from 1991,
and its Taurus model overtook the Honda Accord to become the best-selling US
car, helped by some hefty year-end financial incentives to buyers.
Ford's US vehicle operations lost Dollars 405m in 1992, excluding accounting
charges, an improvement of Dollars 1.8bn over 1991. However, outside the US
losses rose from Dollars 970m to Dollars 1.1bn.
Its financial services company, Ford Credit, had record earnings of Dollars
1.04bn, or Dollars 892m, excluding accounting changes, up from Dollars 749m
in 1991.
Mr Harold Poling, chairman, said the company was cautiously optimistic about
1993. It expected the US vehicle market to rise to around 13.5m cars and
trucks from 13.1m in 1992, while Europe would drop to around 13.7m, against
14.9m.
He said many problems of 1992 were continuing this year. However, cost
reduction efforts and new products, with gradual economic recovery, 'provide
the basis for continued improvement in operating results'.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T seeks damages from telecom
rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ferocious battle for market share in America's long-distance
communications business took a new legal twist yesterday when American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest long-distance group, asked a federal
court to award it damages against three long-distance rivals - MCI
Communications, Sprint and WilTel.
It complained they had undercut AT&amp;T's rates by providing 'secret' contracts
to business customers.
The action stems from an appeals court ruling in Washington DC last November
that all long-distance carriers must publish their prices. This reversed a
ruling by the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the industry
and allowed AT&amp;T's smaller rivals not to publicly file their rates.
AT&amp;T said its damages claim covered 'many millions of dollars.' MCI said
AT&amp;T had been stung by a 'a continuing string of losses to MCI among its
largest customers,' and it dismissed as 'absurd ' the assertion that secret
deals had denied customers the benefits of competition.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Bomb in Colombian oil town: Union threatened over wage
negotiations

<TEXT>
AT LEAST 12 people were killed and 20 wounded yesterday in a car bomb
explosion in the Colombian oil refining town of Barrancabermeja, police
said, Reuter reports from Bogota.
RCN radio, in a report from the town about 160 miles north of Bogota, said
the death toll had risen to 14 after two of the wounded died from their
wounds, but there was no immediate confirmation from police.
Reports from the town said the bomb blew up five blocks from the
headquarters of USO, Colombia's powerful oil workers' union. USO is in wage
talks with the state oil company Ecopetrol and planned a national day of
protest yesterday.
Mr Cesar Carillo, president of the oil workers' union, told Caracol radio in
an interview that the union had been threatened with violence during the
last few days as a result of the wage negotiations.
'We don't know if the victims are union members or oil workers,' he said.
'The authorities are still getting information. There is a lot of
confusion.'
Radio reports said Ecopetrol President Juan Maria Rendon was expected in
Barrancabermeja at the time of the blast to inspect company installations
but there was no suggestion that he might be among the victims.
The last bombing in Colombia occurred on January 30 when fugitive cocaine
king Pablo Escobar allegedly set off a car packed with explosives in a busy
Bogota shopping street, killing 21 people and wounding dozens.
There was no indication that drug traffickers might be responsible for the
Barrancabermeja blast. The oil capital is, however, in the centre of a major
guerrilla zone. Guerrillas have attacked gold and coal mines, oil rigs and
pipelines, power lines, government installations and army patrols.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Bosnia lays down terms for talks

<TEXT>
THE BOSNIAN Moslem foreign minister, Mr Haris Silajdzic, yesterday said his
government could not continue to negotiate a peace settlement for
Bosnia-Hercegovina 'with a gun at our head'.
Speaking at the United Nations shortly before the US was due to announce its
own peace proposals, Mr Silajdzic said he believed Washington's involvement
would secure an international settlement based on democratic principles.
He made clear that the Bosnian government would rejoin the negotiations,
which it has virtually boycotted since they were moved from Geneva to New
York at the beginning of last week, only if certain conditions were
fulfilled. These were that the 'genocide' of the Bosnian Moslem population
be halted and that the heavy weapons of all sides in the conflict be placed
under effective international control.
'If any side does not comply with the placing of heavy weapons under the
physical control of the UN, then force should be used.'
A particular effort had to be made to help the Moslem population of eastern
Bosnia, which was currently the victim of intensive 'ethnic cleansing'
policies undertaken by Bosnian Serb militia and had become 'the most
endangered species in the world'. Aid convoys have been unable to reach this
region.
Mr Silajdzic said it was astonishing that the Bosnian government was being
blamed by international negotiators for blocking a peace agreement, when UN
security council resolutions on the supervision of heavy weapons and the
delivery of humanitarian aid were not being implemented.
If the latest security council resolution on the delivery of humanitarian
aid remains unenforced, then other 'more creative options' should be
exercised in getting aid to the needy, he said. The security council could
authorise air drops of food, as well as opening Tuzla airport for incoming
aid.
Reuter adds from Geneva: UN special investigator Tadeusz Mazowiecki
yesterday said he was prepared to resign if concrete measures were not taken
to prevent human rights abuses in former Yugoslavia,

PLANS to limit the power of motorcycles and prevent tampering with moped
engines are meant to make EC roads safer, the European Commission said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Critics say the EC's executive is meddling in matters the prerogative of
manufacturers, but Commission officials said they had backing from
governments and manufacturers. The proposal to ban motorcycles over 100
brake horsepower would affect only a small number of machines, they added.
It would bring the EC in line with Japan, which has had a 100 brake hp limit
for 15 years and makes more powerful models only for export, a Commission
official said.
The proposal has been in trouble getting through the European parliament
because some MEPs have taken the part of motorcycle users, arguing that
factors other than horsepower cause road accidents. The parliament was to
vote on the legislation late yesterday.
The other proposal, still being drafted, would set technical specifications
for mopeds, aimed to prevent users tampering with engines to make them more
powerful.
The two proposals are among 24 draft laws to set up a single set of
technical specifications for two- and three-wheeled vehicles marketed in the
EC.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Shevardnadze hope of Karabakh peace: Georgian leader
optimistic of chances of settlement in Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Eduard Shevardnadze, the president of Georgia, said yesterday there 'were
grounds for optimism' for peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have
been fighting for five years over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
The former Soviet foreign minister also warned that the forces of democracy
in Russia were 'more troubled than ever' warnedthat their defeat would be 'a
disastrous event for the world.'
Mr Shevardnadze said that in recent meetings with Mr Levan Ter-Petrossyan,
the Armenian president, and Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, the Azerbaijani president,
he had found there was the political will to attempt a negotiated
settlement.
'I think that we have come to the point when all our people are tired of
this conflict. We (three Caucasian presidents) are all of the same mind,' he
said.
Mr Shevardnadze said concessions from both sides had been discussed - and
that both sides would 'bring these ideas out in negotiations.'
Mr Elchibey said at the weekend that 'in one or two months, the psychology
of peace will show its head' and that the three presidents, together with Mr
Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, 'have common thoughts, common ideas
among ourselves'. He warned, however, that reactionary forces in Russia and
in the Caucasian states were blocking peace initiatives.
The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has claimed nearly 3,000 lives and was further
escalated when Armenian and Karabakh forces established a land bridge
through Azerbaijani territory last summer. Over the past few days, Armenian
forces have taken Azerbaijani villages to the north of Karabakh, following
earlier setbacks.
Mr Shevardnadze hopes to convene a meeting of the Caucasian presidents,
probably in Tblisi, to seek a basis for negotiation. He calls his project an
attempt to create 'a peaceful sky over the Caucasus'. He also hopes to
involve the north Caucasian republics in Russia.
The Georgian leader also expressed hope that agreements, due to be signed
between Georgia and Russia over the next two weeks, would produce a better
climate for a settlement of the conflict in the Georgian province of
Abkhazia where separatist forces are fighting Georgian troops. He said
Russia could play a 'positive role in settling the conflict' - though he
accused units of the Russian military and mercenaries from the Russian north
Caucasus of supporting the Abkhazians.
He said that he thought it was a 'possibility' that United Nations troops
would be involved in Abkhazia.
The Georgian economy is suffering from acute energy and other shortages. Mr
Shevardnadze said that former Georgian leader Zviad Gamsakhurdia had made a
'tragic mistake' breaking trade and other links with Russia.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Challenge over EC passport checks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission has been formally challenged to act on a specific
complaint about continued passport controls in the EC's barrier-free
internal market.
Euro Citizen Action Service (Ecas), a lobby group, has asked the Commission
to act urgently against the Dutch authorities for refusing to let a Dutch
citizen board a ferry from Vlissingen to Sheerness in the UK without a
passport.
Ecas opened a telephone line in the first weeks of 1993 to gather comments
about internal border controls, which it believes should have been lifted on
January 1. It hopes to use the complaint of Mr Abraham Mooy, a Dutchman
living in Belgium, as a test case against countries which have refused to
lift such controls.
For now, all 12 member states have continued passport checks on intra-EC
travellers arriving at airports. Nine continental member states are trying
to lift controls by year-end, but Britain, Denmark and Ireland are likely to
maintain checks beyond then.
Mr Mooy's complaint is against Dutch immigration authorities and officials
of the shipping line, which refused to let him board the ferry on January
15. He had forgotten his passport and showed officials his Belgian identity
card.
The case could embarrass the new internal market commissioner, Mr Raniero
Vanni d'Archirafi, who has said he does not want to provoke a confrontation
with member states over passport checks.

FT  11 FEB 93 / People: Beecham's Boyle moves to BUPA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Boyle, a 28-year veteran of Beecham, is moving to take charge of the
international division of BUPA. He becomes one of three managing directors
on the board of Britain's largest private healthcare group, all reporting to
chief executive Peter Jacobs.
BUPA covers around 854,000 people on the international side, with a turnover
in 1991 of Pounds 178m. The organisation, which has seen falling income as
premiums and costs have shot up in Britain, says that premium increases on
the international side, at an average of 15 per cent, have kept pace with
the costs of health care and that the number of people covered by the
division rose slightly in 1992 compared with the previous year.
His most recent assignment at SmithKline Beecham was a four-year stint as
chairman of consumer brands, European division, a position two levels down
from the main board of the Anglo-American company. Previously, he had
travelled widely in various capacities and had lived in Kuala Lumpur in the
mid 1970s as the regional managing director of Beecham products, Far East.
Why is he coming to BUPA? 'The main reason,' says Boyle, 50, 'is that after
28 years it is stimulating and refreshing to make a move.' He adds that
there are many similarities between the two jobs: 'On the insurance side,
after all, BUPA is simply providing a consumer product.'
BUPA has a significant toehold in the Spanish market via its subsidiary
Sanitas, as well as activities in Hong Kong, Malta and Cyprus. Boyle says
part of his brief will be to extend the regional coverage, but will not be
drawn further.
Boyle replaces David Shaw, who had headed international for two and a half
years, and who is retiring after 23 years with BUPA.

Queens Moat Houses, the UK-based hotel group with a large European presence
and even bigger ambitions, has appointed two of its continental executives

The two new directors are Peter Bertholdt, 47, who is responsible for the
group's operations in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and Leonardus van der
Meer, 49, who heads the business in the Netherlands and Belgium.
Queens Moat has more hotel rooms outside the UK than in. John Bairstow, the
chairman, said last year that the Continent would become even more important
to the group. He said that 'the UK will progressively become one of our
major areas of operation, rather than the mainstay of our business'; the two
new board members had played a central role in establishing Queens Moat on
the Continent.

The move of John Aitken, the City's top-rated banking analyst, from NatWest
Securities to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew should mean that the merry-go-round in
City banking analysts has probably come to a stop for the moment.
It started a year ago when Nick Collier, Hoare Govett's banking analyst,
moved to Morgan Stanley. His move left Hoare vulnerable since it was broker
to Lloyds Bank. It then recruited Peter Toeman and Steven Thorn, the City's
number two banking team, from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Shortly afterwards, David Poutney, the other member of the UBS team, left
along with Terry Smith, who was head of research and a well-known
bank-watcher. They have joined Collins Stewart, a small firm of brokers.
Aitken's move to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - he used to work for P&amp;D some years
ago - plugs an obvious gap in its research team. Meanwhile, Aitken's deputy,
Mark Eady, will continue to research the banks for NatWest Securities.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Water regulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S consultation paper on the future supply of water in the UK is
the latest in a series of papers to be published by Mr Ian Byatt, the
director general of the Office of Water Services (Ofwat). The papers have
been produced in the run-up to next year's periodic review of the regulatory
regime for the water industry which will set the pricing formula until 2005.
The publication of these papers has been a commendable demonstration of
glasnost. Mr Byatt has set out the conceptual problems he faces in
regulating this most monopolistic of industries. The water companies,
environmentalists and consumers have all been invited to join the debate and
given data on which to make informed judgments.
This openness has well illustrated the exceptionally difficult problems
faced in regulating the water industry. One of the most intractable is the
requirement imposed on Mr Byatt to allow the water companies to make a
reasonable return on capital. This requirement - not imposed on other
regulators - was deemed necessary if the companies were to raise over Pounds
30bn needed to modernise the industry.
The definition of a reasonable rate of return led to an early clash between
Ofwat and the companies. Mr Byatt proposed a target of 5 to 6 per cent; the
companies say they need 9.5 per cent.
A further complication arises from the division of duties between Ofwat,
which regulates water prices, and other bodies which regulate water quality.
Directives from the European Community and standards set by UK bodies such
as the National Rivers Authority can impose big additional costs on the
water industry. Mr Byatt is responsible for keeping water bills as low as
possible, without being able to control the dominant factor pushing up costs
 -ever-increasing environmental standards. He has usefully brought into the
open the question of whether environmental standards are unnecessarily high
and too expensive.
However, some responses from the industry appear to have merit. It has
criticised yesterday's paper for a premature judgment that meters curb the
growth in demand for water, arguing that preliminary trials have been
inconclusive and the results of the Department of the Environment's fuller
study will not be available for several months. It has complained too that
the arguments in last month's paper were guilty of circularity in defining
the value of the companies' assets.
Yesterday's paper should not, therefore, be the last to be published by
Ofwat before the periodic review. Further reports are needed in which Mr
Byatt summarises the responses to his original position papers and gives an
evaluation of their arguments. Both investors and consumers deserve to learn
of Mr Byatt's response to these rebuttals, and how he proposes to bridge the
gap before he completes his review.

FT  11 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Consortium meets to agree Argentina-Chile
gas pipe - Construction expected to start this year

A GROUP of Chilean, Spanish and Italian companies will meet Argentine
natural gas producers this week to finalise the supply contracts for a
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) trans-Andean gas pipeline that will export gas
from Argentina to Chile.
The consortium - formed by Chilectra and ENAP of Chile, Italgas and SNAM of
Italy, and Gas Natural and Enagas of Spain - wants to tap the natural gas
fields in southern Argentina.
It will then transport gas across the Andes, along a 1,200-km pipeline to
Santiago, the Chilean capital.
The pipeline is the biggest infrastructure project between neighbouring
countries in Latin America since the international debt crisis of the 1980s
put a halt to ambitious schemes of what were then military governments in
the region.
Pre-feasibility studies for the pipeline have been completed and the
consortium has retained Chase Manhattan Bank of the US to act as adviser for
the financing of the project.
Construction work is expected to begin this year, with completion scheduled
for early-1996.
'The pipeline makes economic sense for the two countries,' says Mr Brian
O'Neill, Chase Manhattan's senior vice-president for corporate finance.
'Argentina is in a strong position to become an energy exporter, while Chile
clearly needs to burn cleaner fuels,' he said.
Chilean energy officials back the project as a means to convert industry,
buses, taxis and other fleets of vehicles to compressed natural gas, thereby
reducing the smog that is suffocating Santiago.
Mr O'Neill believes that, if the trans-Andean pipeline is a success,
Argentina will be able to set its sights on exporting natural gas from its
northern fields to the state of Sao Paulo in Brazil, that country's
industrial heartland.
Chile's recent return to international standards of creditworthiness also
makes the financing of the Dollars 1bn project more apt to be feasible.
Chase Manhattan envisages a blend of funding options, including bilateral
government credits, commercial bank loans and tapping of the Chilean capital
markets, as well as a significant equity component from the companies
involved.

FT  11 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Argentina-Chile oil pipeline construction
begins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Construction began this month on a 425km oil pipeline that will link oil
fields in southern Argentina to Chilean refineries in the southern ports of
Talcahuano and San Vicente, Leslie Crawford writes.
The Dollars 300m project is being built by the two state oil companies, ENAP
of Chile and YPF of Argentina, and by Banco Rio de la Plata, an Argentine
bank. The pipeline through the Andean mountains is the first project of its
kind between the two neighbouring countries. It is expected to reduce
Chile's oil import bill by cutting transport costs - ENAP now imports oil
from Africa.
The pipeline will also allow Argentina to ship oil to the Far East from
Chilean ports on the Pacific Ocean.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Japan baffled as US reassesses relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESSIVE Japanese governments have operated in the sure knowledge that the
connection to Washington was 'the most important bilateral US relationship
in the world'. Every US president for the last 30 years has said it, and so,
as both candidate and president-elect, has Mr Bill Clinton.
But two senior Japanese cabinet members, Mr Michio Watanabe, foreign
minister, and Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, are coming to Washington
this week apparently unsure this is still the case.
The Japanese worries have been well advertised. Uncertainty exists over
whether the Clinton administration is free-trade or protectionist and, if
the latter, the extent to which Japan, with its Dollars 50bn (Pounds 33.1bn)
bilateral trade surplus, will become a target.
Every pronouncement by every newly installed US official is scrutinised with
minute care by the Japanese.
Beyond commerce, there is also concern about the general US commitment to
Asia and particular worries about the new US approach to China. Mr Winston
Lord, state department under-secretary with regional responsibilities, is a
former ambassador to Beijing and a conspicuous recent critic of Chinese
external and human rights policies.
Yet Tokyo's concerns, which extend beyond concrete policies, are not exactly
mirrored in Washington. This may well be the essence of the current problem.
Japanese foreign policy tends to be rooted in certain anchors, such as the
relationship with the US. For 10 years, from 1977 to 1987, the ultimate
assurance of continuity was provided by the comforting presence in the
Japanese capital of Ambassador Mike Mansfield, whose understanding of Japan
was exceptional and whose political power in Washington (he was a
long-standing senator) effectively kept the lid on successive
administrations' intermittent inclinations to take a tougher line with
Japan.
Mr Michael Armacost, his successor, displayed some of the same skills, but
with nothing like the political authority. Now Japan wonders who will be the
next 'minder' of the relationship in Washington and in Tokyo.
Mr Lord is a China hand and is surrounding himself mostly with like-minded
people, with Mr Thomas Hubbard, a Japan expert and most recently deputy
ambassador in Manila, back on board running the Japan desk.
But no sign exists of a decision on the successor to Mr Armacost. Japanese
nerves were jangled during the transition by rumours that the post might be
offered to Mr Chalmers Johnson, the distinguished Japanologist from the
University of California, best known as the 'godfather' of the revisionist
school of thinking towards Japan.
In a recent New York Times article, Mr Johnson wrote that the US should
recognise its 'failure' to open Japanese markets and 'start over'. A new
approach was 'justified on grounds that Japan, as it admits, is not the kind
of capitalist economy envisioned by the Gatt negotiators.' That is the sort
of language that scares Japan to the core.
Mr Johnson probably will not get the job, but the absence of a clear
candidate concerns the Japanese, due to their addiction to form over
substance in foreign policy.
Thus, it matters to Tokyo that no meeting has yet been arranged between Mr
Clinton and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime minister, whereas Presidents
Reagan and Bush both met Mr Miyazawa's predecessors immediately on assuming
office. Not all the blame for this omission is laid at the US door. The
truth is that Washington has not yet got round to thinking much about Japan.
But two developments this week, the US commitment to seek an extension of
the fast-track negotiating authority on trade and Detroit's decision not to
go ahead with anti-dumping suits against foreign car makers, offer some
generalised reassurance.
Equally, the weekend session between Mr Hayashi and Mr Lloyd Bentsen,
treasury secretary, (the first he has held with a foreign finance minister)
seems to indicate the US appreciates Japan's place as an important player in
the Group of Seven.
Mr Bentsen has talked of the need to revitalise the G7 before the annual
summit in Tokyo in July, with a finance ministerial meeting planned for
March as the next step in the process.
But trade and China top Mr Watanabe's agenda. He will propose replacing the
long-running Strategic Impediments Initiative with new institutions to
discuss trade and medium-term macro-economic issues, such as the US federal
deficit, rather than details about the imbalance in particular industries.
Just as Washington's internal politics and personalities are receiving
minute attention in Tokyo, much inevitable emphasis is being placed there on
the views of Mr Mickey Kantor, trade representative. One official said he
could be bad news if led by protectionist sentiment, but he might be good
news, if the president were really in charge of trade policy. 'Trade
relations could get a lot worse or a lot better. We just don't know yet.'
What to the US is a natural reassessment of the relationship appears to
Japan as confusion.

IG Metall, Germany's engineering trade union, yesterday said it would use
the strike weapon 'as the last resort' if employers refuse a wage increase
of over 10 per cent this year for its members in east Germany, Judy Dempsey
writes from Berlin.
The warning follows the start of arbitration talks in Saxony last week.
Further talks will take place in the other east German states over the next
few weeks.
Previous talks broke down after employers had said they would not accept
rapid pay increases to bring east German wages up to 82 per cent of west
German levels, from the 70 per cent level at present.
Yesterday, Mr Klaus Zwickel, IG Metall vice-chairman, said employers were
'reneging' on commitments to income parity between west and east Germany by
1994. He rejected criticism his union was pricing east German workers out of

IG Metall, Germany's engineering trade union, yesterday said it would use
the strike weapon 'as the last resort' if employers refuse a wage increase
of over 10 per cent this year for its members in east Germany.
The warning follows the start of arbitration talks in Saxony last week.
Further talks take place in the other east German states over the next few
weeks.
Previous talks broke down after the employers' union said it would not
accept rapid pay increases which would bring east German wages up to 82 per
cent of west German levels from the 70 per cent level at present.
Yesterday, Mr Klaus Zwickel, vice chairman of IG Metall, said the employers'
union was 'reneging' on its commitment to income parity between west and
east German states by 1994. 'The employers are provoking us. We signed a
contract in 1991. And we will stick to it. It is only fair, particularly
since east German workers have to pay west German prices, and have seen
housing and other subsidies sharply reduced.'
Mr Zwickel rejected criticism that his union was pricing east German workers
out of the market - despite the fact that unit labour costs are about 150
per cent higher and productivity is lower than 70 per cent of west German
levels.
But IG Metall union officials conceded that it might not have full backing
for any strike call because rising unemployment is eroding the union's
active membership.
Most engineering workers, some 750,000 in the east German states, are
members of IG Metall. But since unification the number east German
engineering workers who have actually got a job has shrunk to 300,000. Also,
50 per cent of these are under the supervision of the Treuhand, the east
German privatisation agency. Further privatisations could reduce the clout
of I G Metall.
'We do not want to be pushed into a strike,' said Mr Zwickel. 'But we will
not let our employees be pushed around.'
However, several factory managers in west Germany yesterday believed that
the employers' union would find a way out of the contract by invoking
'revision clauses'. This means that employers can argue that if the
developments in the new east German states deviated from their original
plans, the parties have the right to reconsider the clauses of the original
contract.

FT  11 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Steadier day as technology
issues bought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
ALTHOUGH shares in blue chip industrial companies traded in a narrow range
yesterday, secondary stocks posted gains amid selective buying of technology
issues, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.16 at 3,412.42,
well above its low for the day of 3,394.32. The more broadly based Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 ended a slight 0.90 up at 446.23, while the American SE
composite was 1.10 firmer at 416.10 and the Nasdaq composite 2.81 higher at
695.02. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 248m shares.
After Tuesday's losses, the markets settled down as investors awaited the
next big move. There was no lead from the economy, and the failure of the
Treasury market to hang on to its early gains also left equities rudderless.
Dealers and investors, however, were pleased that trading volume has been
relatively light during the recent sell-off - an indication that the
downward move in prices was a consolidatory move, and not a major shift in
sentiment.
Trading in Eastman Kodak was delayed due to an early order imbalance on the
sell side. When business finally opened, the stock tumbled Dollars 3 to
Dollars 50 1/2 on heavy selling, before rallying to end with a net loss of
Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 52 after volume of 3.7m shares.
The market was reacting to a downgrade from Mr Eugene Glazer, the sector
analyst at broking house Dean Witter Reynolds. Mr Glazer said he had lowered
his rating on Kodak from 'buy' to 'neutral' because he believed that the
stock had become overpriced following its recent gains, and that investor
expectations may have been driven too high.
Ford eased early on, but rallied to end Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars 49
3/4 on news of a big fourth quarter and full year loss that was roughly in
line with market expectations. The other members of the Big Three were
firmer, with Chrysler up Dollars 1 at Dollars 40 1/4 and General Motors
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 39 1/4 . The latter was helped by news that the
television network NBC had publicly apologised for rigging tests that
purported to show a GM truck bursting into flame after a collision.
Aetna Life &amp; Casualty slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 51 3/4 and Travelers
eased Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 28 1/8 after the two composite insurers
unveiled big fourth quarter losses incurred in the wake of a variety of
special charges.
On the Nasdaq market, a selection of technology stocks were strong, with
Intel Dollars 4 ahead at Dollars 114 3/4 in volume of 4.6m shares and
Microsoft Dollars 1 5/8 firmer at Dollars 85 1/2 , but Apple fell Dollars 1
1/8 to Dollars 55 3/4 .
Canada
TORONTO stock prices extended their February rally in continued heavy
trading, closing solidly higher with the help of strong gold and real estate
shares.
The TSE 300 index advanced 28.9 to 3,443.0 and rises led falls by 397 to 276
after volume of 60.7m shares. Thirteen of 14 stock groups gained ground, led
by the golds sector, up 4.3 per cent, as the spot price for gold in New York
added USDollars 3 at USDollars 332.50 an ounce.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price rise for rough diamonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROUGH DIAMOND prices are going up for the first time in nearly three years.
De Beers, the South African group that controls about 80 per cent of the
rough (uncut) diamond market, announced yesterday that it would be changing
its prices and assortments from next Monday to produce an overall increase
of 1.5 per cent.
Analysts suggest that this is another sign that De Beers has regained
control over the market after a year when its grip seemed threatened by deep
recession in many industrialised countries and an upsurge in smuggling out
of Angola.
Last autumn the group told producers to cut agreed deliveries by 25 per cent
as it struggled to bring supply and demand back into balance.
De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation said yesterday demand
for particular categories of rough stones had recently been strong. 'We
think this will be sustained and the market can absorb the price increase
relatively easily.'
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at Credit Lyonnaise Laing, suggested: 'The
crisis has passed for the diamond market for the moment. De Beers obviously
thinks the market has turned for the better'.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kuwait claims big oil
production rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT'S OIL production has leapt by 210,000 barrels a day in the past few
weeks to 1.98m barrels a day, according to Mr Ali al-Baghli, the country's
oil minister, who said any cut from that level would be 'painful'.
The minister, quoted in Kuwait's al-Anba newspaper, denied that the recent
rise in production had contributed to slippage in the oil price and said
Kuwait would discuss the proposals for the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to cut output during this weekend's meeting 'with
understanding and reason'.
But the minister's comment that 'a reduction would be painful for us'
signals Kuwait's determination to retain output at levels as near present
production as possible and resist pressure from fellow Opec members to
subscribe to a ceiling much below 2m b/d.
For the last Opec agreement in November Kuwait undertook to produce 1.5m b/d
and raise production only as market conditions allowed. Yesterday's figures,
however, are well ahead of the oil ministry's previously stated targets for
1993, which put output at 1.85m b/d in the second quarter, 2.05m in the
third and 2.15m b/d in the fourth. Kuwait's pre-Gulf war quota was 1.5m b/d,
but it was lifting at least 2m b/d before the invasion.
Industry analysts viewed Mr al-Baghli's figures with some scepticism,
suggesting that Kuwait's output was likely to be nearer the 1.778m b/d he
announced in late January. 'A figure of nearly 2m is a bit of posturing,'
said Mr Fareed Mohammedi, an analyst with Petroleum Finance Company in
Washington. 'The issue is where Kuwait is going to cut from, and they don't
want to cut from 1.5m b/d, they want to cut from 1.9m b/d'
Last month's tour among Opec members by Mr Alirio Parra, the cartel's
president, produced broad agreement, between Iran and Saudi Arabia in
particular, that the organisation should seek to trim at least 1m b/d from
its overall output to support prices, with the Saudis suggesting that the
cuts should be pro-rata from all producers.
Mr Gholamreza Agazadeh, Iran's oil minister, was quoted yesterday on Tehran
Radio as saying that the cut should be from Opec's nominal, but abused,
ceiling of 24.58m b/d reached at its last meeting in November to 23.5m b/d.
But he said that such a cut would merely sustain prices at present levels
and that he would enter this weekend's meeting calling for a cut of more
than 1m b/d. Most industry figures put Opec's actual present production at
more than 25m b/d.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Chinese candidates line up for
HK listing - The flotations which will add a new dimension to the colony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year some of China's largest state-run industries will be listed on the
Hong Kong stock exchange, adding a new dimension to a stock market that has
long been driven by local political and property influences.
The potential for Hong Kong is enormous, and the pull for advisers has been
similarly compelling. More than 40 merchant banks have lined up to fight for
the mandate for the flotation of just one of the companies, Qingdao Brewery,
which produces one of China's best-known exports, Tsingtao beer.
Shanghai Petrochemical, which is the largest and probably the first of the
flotations, is set to raise as much as HKDollars 3bn (USDollars 388m). In
total, analysts believe the nine short-listed companies will raise more than
HKDollars 7bn.
If successful, there is an enormous supply of further candidates from among
the country's financially stretched state industries, which are keen to tap
international capital flows by developing a strong Chinese element to what
will in five years become a Chinese-owned stock market.
However, there are sizeable obstacles to be overcome before these Chinese
flotations can be smoothly launched in Hong Kong. Not least of these is a
need for re-education of the companies' management.
Only recently, Chinese company directors would have been jailed for
releasing commercial information to foreigners. Now they are going to be
obliged to provide even more detailed disclosure than under the old state
system.
Management freedom comes at a high price. It will have to cope with the
dislocation of facing up to market forces and having responsibility to a new
body of shareholders. This compares with the undemanding quota systems that
they are used to.
Potential investors will also need educating, as these companies represent
an entirely new business concept. 'These corporations are like industrial
revolution style company towns, where everyone owes their soul to the
company store,' said one merchant banker.
Shanghai Petrochemical, China's sixth largest petrochemical company, is an
entire city. The company oversees everything from the law courts to the fire
service, and employs an estimated 63,000 people. The general manager is like
a mayor, and drives around 'his' city with a red flashing light on the top
of his car.
Merrill Lynch was awarded the role of global co-ordinator for the flotation,
but despite having a June target for the public offer, there is no decision
yet as to what can actually be listed. It is clear that the corporation's
social responsibilities will be unacceptable to a new shareholder base, but
an alternative structure has yet to be conceived.
Senior representatives of the Hong Kong stock exchange met China's
Securities Committee - the new regulatory body for China's capital markets -
in Nanjing this week to wrestle with some of the technical problems
presented by the listings.
One international corporate lawyer pointed out that a Chinese enterprise has
to complete a share offering in order to become a separate legal entity.
As a result, some issues of B shares - shares available only to foreign
investors - on the Chinese stock markets have been for companies that did
not legally exist during the subscription period. The Hong Kong stock
exchange will want to address this.
The Chinese government wants all nine industrial companies to be listed by
the end of the year, and there is already rumoured to be a second batch of
12 companies ready for flotation in early 1994.
'When the Chinese top leaders want to do something, they put a lot of effort
into it and they get it done very quickly,' said Mr Tommy Wong, of Kwan Wong
Tan &amp; Fong, a local accountancy firm which is handling two of the Chinese
flotations.
Accountants agree that the process is aided by the level of detail in state
company records. As Mr Wong says: 'They shoot people for economic crimes.'
However, translating Chinese accounting systems into a set of
internationally accepted accounts is proving complex, with major differences
in the treatment of equity accounting, foreign exchange translation, and
stock-taking. The revised accounts will bear little resemblance to the
current profit claims of the companies.
But an unprecedented number of merchant banks are prepared to take up the
challenge. Corporate financiers have been cutting documentation fees to the
bone in order to fight for mandates, which are due to be announced before
the end of February.
Mr Ambrose Lam, managing director of corporate finance at Standard Chartered
Asia, said: 'It is recognised not to be very profitable, but it is worth it
to get the recognition, and hopefully to have a better chance with the next
batch of issues.'
The Securities Committee is taking an active role throughout. The committee
is led by Zhu Rongji - a member of the Communist party's most powerful
decision-making body - which emphasises the importance that China is
attaching to this programme.
The committee has decided to focus on Chinese incorporated listings in Hong
Kong, rather than allowing companies to incorporate and be floated further
afield - such as the New York listing of Brilliance Automotive.
Beijing must be heartened by the fact that the HKDollars 403m offer for Hong
Kong registered Denway Investments, the Chinese car manufacturer, is
understood to have attracted more than HKDollars 200bn in subscription
funds.
The response suggests a quite extraordinary level of demand for China shares
in Hong Kong. The use of leading international houses such as Merrill's will
enable future issues to tap an even broader investor base.
The managing director of a local corporate finance house said: 'Knowing the
pent-up demand by Chinese companies for capital, it would be inconceivable
that they would float less than 20 state companies per year, after the first
batch. Therefore they understand the importance of getting it right first
time.'

cross-shareholdings

<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corporation yesterday pulled out of the last of its
significant cross-shareholdings with Australian banking colleagues when it
sold a 5.6 per cent stake in Perth-based Challenge Bank for about ADollars
15m (USDollars 10m).
This followed Monday's sale of Westpac's shareholdings in both the ANZ
Banking Group and the Bank of Melbourne for a total of about ADollars 260m.
The sales are part of an asset disposal programme.
FAI Insurances, the financial services group, cut its after-tax loss from
ADollars 17.2m to ADollars 6.5m in the December half on a marginal revenue
rise from ADollars 513.5m to ADollars 521.8m.
FAI said the result reflected a reduction in underwriting loss from ADollars
49.8m to ADollars 21.8m. It forecast a small loss for the full year to June,
1993.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: A&amp;P target of NY state pension
fund campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US supermarket group majority
owned by Germany's Tengelmann retailing group, is to be the first company
targeted by New York state's large pension fund in a campaign against poorly
performing management.
New York's move represents a significant advance by the US movement for
better corporate governance, which seeks to give shareholders a greater say
in the affairs of companies with weak results.
Until now, action by institutional investors against such companies has been
led most vociferously by the Dollars 71bn California Public Employee
Retirement System. New York is becoming more publicly aggressive as it has
developed a computer-based system to track the financial performance of top
US companies.
Mr Edward Regan, Comptroller of New York state, said the Dollars 56bn
pension fund would vote against the election of A&amp;P's slate of directors at
its annual meeting in July.
It would also seek the support of other shareholders for an amendment to the
company's by-laws which would force it to include in its annual proxy or
shareholder voting material statements from large shareholders wishing to
comment on the group's performance. The fund owns 260,000 of A&amp;P's 38.2m
shares outstanding.
Tengelmann's 53 per cent ownership of the chain means New York's campaign
cannot succeed without the support of the German company, and this seems
unlikely. But the state's stance, if followed by other institutions, could
send a powerful message of shareholder dissatisfaction.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: French insurers' profits plunge
under pressure - How the fall in earnings might affect the prospects for
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MONTHS France's large insurance groups have made no secret of being
under pressure. But it was only on Tuesday when the usually optimistic Mr
Claude Bebear, chairman of Axa, addressed analysts in Paris that it was
clear just how heavy the pressure had been.
Axa, the second largest French insurer, not only announced a sharp fall in
net profits to about FFr1.5bn (Dollars 268m) in 1992 from FFr2.4bn the year
before. It also said that it was raising FFr3.65bn in a convertible-bond
issue to recapitalise Equitable Life, its US associate.
Later that day, Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), France's biggest single
insurer, revealed its 1992 net profits had plummeted to about FFr1.15bn,
from FFr3.8bn in 1991. Analysts are now steeled for more gloomy figures when
Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and the GAN Group publish their 1992
results.
French insurers are operating in intensely competitive conditions as the
economic slowdown is making it more difficult for them to pump up profits
with asset sales as they did in 1991, when all the 'big four' would
otherwise have been in the red.
These problems could scarcely have come at a worse time. France's insurance
industry has hit the doldrums just as the three state-controlled companies -
UAP, AGF and GAN - are preparing to be privatised by a future French
government after next month's elections.
Even the most optimistic French insurers are resigned to another set of
lack-lustre results this year. The economy is unlikely to show any signs of
recovery at least until the second half, assuming that the franc stabilises
and interest rates come down.
In the meantime, the industry faces the same problems that beset it last
year. Competition remains intense both in terms of the number of players in
the market and pressure on tariffs. The economic squeeze has produced a
predictable increase in the number of claims, including suspected false
claims, and continues to depress the value of the insurers' industrial
portfolios.
Moreover, the property market shows no sign of recovery. This affects the
insurers in two ways. First, they face another year of high provisions.
Second, their asset sales will again be too low to compensate for poor
operating profits and hefty provisions.
The Paris stock market is rife with rumours about the insurers selling
properties to each other, allegedly at inflated prices.
In the short term, this cushions them against the slump and helps prop up
the market. But, in the long term, they will have to carry those properties
on their books.
The industry's future is more reassuring. The FFr240bn life market should be
boosted by the forthcoming reform of French pensions, which is expected to
supplement the state system with private pension plans.
Meanwhile, competition appears to be easing in the FFr200m non-life sector
as the growth of the mutuelles, which sell insurance to specialist groups of
employees, peaks. There are also signs of tariffs rising in certain sectors,
notably motor insurance.
The general economic recovery should alleviate the pressure on the stock
market and on residential property - although it is expected to take at
least three years for the over-saturated commercial property market to
recover.
French insurers should also start to benefit from their international
expansion in the early 1990s.
Axa is expected to receive more substantial contributions from Equitable
Life in the US. AGF now owns a substantial stake in AMB, the German insurer,
after a complex transaction last year.
UAP has invested in Germany via its holding in Nordstern, although it is
smarting from its failure to buy a stake in Colonia from Victoire, the
insurance subsidiary of the Suez industrial group.
These developments should ensure that the large French insurers stabilise
profits this year and secure moderate growth next year. 'We can't hope for
much from any of the big French insurers in 1993,' said Mr Michael Huttner,
European insurance analyst at BNP Securities in London. 'But we can expect
to see a gradual recovery from 1994 onwards.'
The critical question is whether this improvement will come in time to
enable the next French government to sell all, or part, of its shares in
UAP, AGF and GAN.
All three are eager to enter the private sector, where they would be free to
raise capital from the markets and would not be barred, as state-controlled
companies, from investing in the US. The centre-right alliance, favoured to
win next month's poll, plans to privatise them as quickly as possible.
The consensus among analysts is that all three companies are saleable
despite their present problems. 'The market loves a recovery story,' said
one. 'The only problem for the French government is judging how the 1992 and
1993 figures will affect the price.'

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft plans DM1bn
in non-core disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the Frankfurt mining and industrial conglomerate which
has in recent years been one of Germany's most acquisitive companies, is now
planning large-scale disposals.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive, told analysts yesterday the group
plans to make disposals to raise around DM1bn (Dollars 606m) over the next
two years.
At the same time, capital investment is to be scaled back by 40 per cent to
DM1bn for the current year.
He gave no indication of which companies were for sale, apart from saying
they would be non-core businesses and would not include any famous names.
This rules out Buderus - the heating products company which now has a
separate listing on the German stock-market - or any of the other industrial
companies acquired last year from Stora of Sweden in a DM1.45bn acquisition.
A list of potential sales targets has been drawn up, but a final decision on
which of the group's 258 subsidiaries are to be sold has yet to be taken.
Mr Schimmelbusch indicated that the group would be reducing the workforce -
which rose through acquisitions from 38,173 to 62,547 over 1991-92 - during
the the course of the year. But he gave no details of how many jobs would be
cut and in which divisions.
The disposals programme is a reaction to difficult market conditions for the
Metallgesellschaft group. In the year to the end of September, group pre-tax
profits fell 23 per cent to DM245m. This is the second successive year that
profits have declined sharply against a background of falling metal prices
and difficulties in the car components sector, which have meant that the
group's Kolbenschmidt subsidiary lost DM88.6m last year before tax. Group
sales last year fell 21 per cent to DM25.6bn.
Analysts estimate that the group's net debt stands at DM2.1bn, compared to
equity of DM3.7bn. The group's market capitalisation is DM2.9bn.
Mr Schimmelbusch said that trading in the first four months of the current
year was at the same, unsatisfactory level as in the previous year. The
central problem was low base metal prices - afflicted by cheap imports from
eastern Europe.
Kaufhof, the large German retail group, yesterday reported that sales rose
by 13 per cent in 1992 to DM20.3bn, up from DM18bn a year earlier.
The company said the sales growth reflected its strategy of expanding into
high-growth niche-retail markets, a segment of the business which accounted
for 27 per cent of group sales, up from 23 per cent in the previous year.
Department store sales accounted for 47 per cent of the total, down from 53
per cent.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Thomson expands broadcasting
interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON-CSF, France's state-controlled defence electronics group, is
expanding its broadcasting interests by buying the transmitter, antenna and
electron tube businesses owned by ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-based
power engineering concern.
The deal, for an undisclosed sum, will involve the transfer of companies
with combined sales of FFr500m (Dollars 93.28m) in 1991.
They include an electron-tube production plant in Switzerland and a
joint-venture in Poland, as well as an antenna plant in Germany and a
broadcast transmitter unit in Switzerland.
Thomson, which was last year clouded by controversy over its attempt to
expand its defence interests by taking over the missiles division of the LTV
group in the US, has for some time been keen to augment its broadcast
activities, where it services both private and public sector television
companies.
The French group already owns electron-tube factories and plants for
broadcast transmitters in France and the US.
Thomson said yesterday that the acquisition of the ABB businesses would
enable the group to 'maintain critical mass and to continue to increase
sales through external growth in a contracting market'.
The ABB deal is the latest in a number of acquisitions for Thomson-CSF.
The French group has bought a series of businesses over the past three years
in order to consolidate its position in specific sectors and to sustain
sales growth.
Thomson-CSF last year made sales of Dollars 6.2bn.
For ABB, the disposal is part of an ongoing process of shedding peripheral
interests.
The Zurich-based group mustered turnover of Dollars 28bn last year.
It specialises in sectors such as electro-technology, environmental
technology and transport systems.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: NHL to repay Pounds 120m bond issue on time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Home Loans, the centralised mortgage lender, yesterday signalled
confidence in its prospects of recovery by announcing that it intended to
repay Pounds 120.1m in D-Mark bond issues on time rather than rescheduling
the debt.
The shares firmed  3/4 p to 6 1/4 p.
The group said it had postponed rescheduling offers to holders of Pounds
48.4m of bonds due for payment on June 7, and Pounds 71.7m of bonds due in
mid-1995.
It now intended to repay the debt rather than moving back the repayment
dates to the end of 1995.
The company said it had postponed plans to reschedule debt because of the
'significant costs' of making exchange offers, and because improving
prospects for the UK housing market had made it more confident of its own
trading prospects.
It added that its confidence had also been increased by the falls in
sterling interest rates.
Mr Jonathan Perry, chairman, said the cost of exchanging the bonds, which
trade on the Frankfurt exchange, included fees and commissions to exchange
agents, higher interest rates on the bonds, and legal fees.
The company, which had to reschedule on-balance sheet debt of Pounds 700m
last June to keep trading, requires permission both from banks involved in
the refinancing, and from holders of Pounds 50m of dollar bonds already
rescheduled to 1995.
Mr Perry said that the banks had 30 days to respond to the request for
consent.
Dollar bond holders would be consulted at a meeting for which 21 days notice
would be given.
He said that if consent was not given, the company would have to return to
its original plan to reschedule the D-Mark bonds. The company originally
said it was confident that the D-Mark bonds would be rescheduled by the end
of 1992.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Canon to buy Next hardware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANON, the Japanese office equipment manufacturer, is set to acquire the
computer hardware business of Next Computer, the innovative US computer
company. It already holds a 16.7 per cent stake in Next, and was the
company's first outside investor.
Formed in 1985 by Mr Steven Jobs, the computer entrepreneur who co-founded
Apple Computer, Next is abandoning computer manufacturing to concentrate on
selling its highly-regarded computer software.
The move represents a disappointment for Mr Jobs, who had hoped to repeat
his achievements at Apple by creating another industry-leading computer
company.
It also reflects Canon's growing involvement in the computer business, where
its presence so far has been restricted mainly to the manufacture of
peripherals, particularly laser printers.
Mr Jobs owns 46 per cent of Next while Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire
and former presidential candidate, owns 11 per cent.
It has, however, sold only about 50,000 computers, in spite of having
software that is widely praised by computer experts.
In May, Next will introduce a new version of its Nextstep computer operating
system for personal computers. This will place Next in competition with
Microsoft, which dominates the PC operating system.
However, Mr Jobs is confident that it can overcome Microsoft's near
monopoly. 'We believe that we are two to three years ahead of Microsoft and
Taligent,' he said. Taligent is a joint venture between Apple Computer and
International Business Machines that is developing a new PC operating
system.
Next will close its Freemont, California, factory by the end of the month,
he said. The company will cut its workforce from 530 to about 200.
'Canon has not decided what it wants to do, but there should be a decision
by the end of the month,' said Mr Jobs.
Just last month, he announced Next had achieved its first quarterly
operating profit in the fourth quarter of 1992. He said revenues for 1992
were Dollars 127m (Pounds 88.5m), up 10 per cent from 1991. Next had been
planning a public share offering.
If an agreement is finalised, Canon would also gain exclusive sales rights
to Next's software products in the Pacific and Asia as well as the right to
use software that would enable Canon copiers and printers to run on Next
software.
Canon will continue to supply Next hardware and maintenance service in the
Asia and Pacific areas in which it already does so. Motorola supports Next
customers in the US.
A Canon representative said yesterday that 'Canon has a history of
diversification and it is conceivable that in future it will build a
computer business' based on the Next hardware operations it is considering
acquiring.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Borrowing rules for public bodies may ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOOLS and hospitals could be allowed to borrow against their assets if
government plans for finding new ways of involving private finance in public
projects are implemented.
The Treasury believes that the Department of Health, the Department of
Education and the Home Office are among areas with the most scope for the
government's private finance initiative to move beyond the transport
infrastructure.
All three departments are also in the first round of the longer-term public
spending review announced earlier this week, and so have a particular
incentive to find ways of stretching their budgets.
Extending the ability to borrow would build on the move announced in the
Autumn Statement, when the rule preventing universities from borrowing
against Exchequer-funded assets was ended. The old universities have made
little use of the power so far, but many new universities - formerly
polytechnics - which have had a similar ability for a few years, have taken
more advantage of the change.
'We need to think whether the model applies elsewhere,' one minister said
yesterday. Proposals are unlikely to be far enough advanced for inclusion in
next month's Budget, but could be ready in time for the first unified Budget
and spending statement in December.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, is to use a
series of meetings with all Whitehall departments over the next few months
to discuss ideas for pressing ahead with the private finance initiative.
He will outline the government's plans to the cross-party Treasury committee
next week.
Private involvement in transport projects - where the cost can be passed on
to the user through charges - has seen the greatest advance in the
initiative so far.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, is to publish a consultation
paper after Easter on introducing tolls on motorways, and there is already
discussion of how the rules on funding for roads might be adapted to rail
projects.
Ministers believe that the private sector has a valuable role to play in
upgrading public-sector capital stock. Large sums could be at stake. While
there are no precise figures for capital spending on schools and hospitals
in 1992-93, capital investment in health, excluding trust hospitals, is
estimated at Pounds 1.43bn, and in education, by local government, at Pounds
1.08bn.
Giving the private sector a greater role would not necessarily mean that the
public sector would withdraw from providing capital in these spheres,
ministers say.
However if private finance proved a better way of providing capital for a
particular type of asset, they say, then the public spending priorities
would be bound to change.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Society uses BES for homes disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL &amp; West Building Society will today become the first society to use
the government's Business Expansion Scheme to try to take repossessed
properties off its balance sheet and rent them to the private sector through
assured tenancies.
The society has spent two years trying to devise a method of using the
scheme - which offers tax relief to savers who make five-year investments -
to reduce its stock of repossessions. Any such scheme has to be approved by
the Building Societies Commission.
The Pounds 45m Bristol &amp; West scheme is intended to rent out up to 800 of
the society's repossessed properties through housing associations. Building
societies' legal duty to gain the highest possible price for repossessed
properties has largely prevented them from renting directly to tenants.
Mr Tony FitzSimons, the society's chief executive, said last night that the
scheme would offer investors attractive returns, and would allow the society
to move properties off its balance sheet without selling them at low prices
because they are repossessions. The society has established a separate
company as a vehicle for the scheme.
Many building societies have been trying to devise ways of reducing the
stock of repossessed properties, which have obliged them to increase their
provisions for bad debts.

share sale

   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA plans to sell Dollars 600m worth of shares in CANTV, the telephone
company managed by GTE Corporation of the US, by June this year, Reuter
reports from Caracas.
Mr Julian Villalba, president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, said that a
small block of shares would be issued on the Caracas stock exchange to
establish market value and the rest would be placed on foreign stock
exchanges.
'We are looking to register them on an exchange, through any mechanism, and
it doesn't have to be on Wall Street,' said Mr Villalba. The Dollars 600m in
shares would represent one-third of the state's 49 per cent stake in CANTV.
The government had said it would sell its stake in the telephone concern in
the first quarter of 1993. Recent news reports said the government planned
to delay the sale until next year to get a better price.
In November 1991, a consortium of companies led by GTE paid Dollars 1.88bn
for 40 per cent of CANTV and took managerial control. Another 11 per cent of
shares were sold to employees.
The government hoped that recent investments worth several hundred million
dollars to improve and expand the system would factor into the share price,
Mr Villalba said.
Mr Villalba said the new sale of shares could be made in the US but
officials would look at exchanges in Europe or Asia. Lehman Brothers would
be lead underwriters of the sale on foreign exchanges, he said.
The government said it expected to raise about Dollars 2bn this year from
the privatisation of state companies, including about Dollars 1.2bn from
utilities.
The controlling US shareholders in New Zealand's Telecom Corporation have
extended until September 12, 1994 an option to sell their shareholdings.
Under a 1990 agreement, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech of the US bought 100 per
cent of Telecom from the New Zealand government, on condition that they
reduced their shareholding to 49.9 per cent by September, 1993.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOLSON Companies, the diversified Canadian brewer, suffered a 24 per cent
setback in its latest quarterly earnings, largely as a result of a weak beer
market, retaliatory duties on beer imposed by the US and the costs of
converting to a new beer bottle.
Net earnings fell to CDollars 25.3m (USDollars 20m), or 42 cents a share, in
the three months to December 31, the third quarter of the company's fiscal
year, from CDollars 33.4m, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenues rose to CDollars 769.8m from CDollars 723.3m.
The negative factors were partially offset by CDollars 4.9m in fees received
from the North American ice hockey league, one of whose teams is owned by
Molson.
Nine-month earnings fell to CDollars 100.1m, or CDollars 1.68 a share, from
CDollars A 110.4m, or CDollars 1.97 a share.
The company said yesterday the decline in earnings for the year as a whole
was likely to be 10 to 12 per cent.

cable TV companies

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHWESTERN Bell, one of the seven Baby Bell regional telephone companies
in the US, has agreed to buy two cable television systems in suburban
Washington DC for Dollars 650m - a move which marks a dramatic escalation of
the battle between telephone and cable industries to bring communications
into the 21st century American home.
Southwestern Bell is the first US telephone company to try to buy control of
a US cable television company and its move could set off a scramble by other
telecommunications companies. However, the purchase requires regulatory
approval from the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission
and Judge Harold Greene, who has overseen the Baby Bells since they were
split off from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph in a 1984 anti-trust court
settlement. Clearing all these fences could take Southwestern Bell a very
long time.
The seller of the two systems is Hauser Communications, a privately owned
company.
Southwestern Bell provides local telephone services in Texas and other
southwestern states. It is barred from owning a cable company there, under
1984 cable legislation preventing any local telephone company from owning a
cable business in its core operating area.
Southwestern Bell already owns a cellular telephone franchise in the
Washington area and could eventually try to link this into its cable system.
This would mean a competitive challenge to the Baby Bell which provides
normal, wired telephone services in this area, Bell Atlantic.
Southwestern Bell owns and operates a system in Britain and has interests in
others in Israel.

WOOLWORTH Corporation yesterday named Mr William Lavin as chairman and chief
executive to replace Mr Harold Sells when he retires, at the age of 65, in
July.
Mr Lavin, 48, has served as the US retailer's chief financial officer since
1991. He joined Woolworth in 1981 as an assistant controller.
On Wall Street, shares in Woolworth rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 29 3/4 . An
announcement about Mr Sells successor has been expected since September,
when a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed Mr Sells had sold
Dollars 3.4m of stock in the company. Woolworth said then the move was in
preparation for his retirement.
Mr Sells, who became Woolworth's chief executive in 1983, began his career
working for Kinney Shoe in 1945. Kinney is now a division of Woolworth.
Woolworth said it has changed the organisational structures of its FW
Woolworth and Kinney Shoe units. FW Woolworth will now run Rx Place, a
deep-discount drug store chain which had been operated as a separate unit.
Kinney Shoe will run the Little Folk Shop and Kids Mart children's apparel
stores.

<TEXT>
CBS Inc, which owns one of the three US television networks, yesterday
unveiled a 254 per cent surge in fourth-quarter net income, reflecting the
network's rise to the top of the prime-time television ratings and a better
advertising environment.
The group posted fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 33.3m, or Dollars 2.14
a share, against Dollars 9.4m, or 61 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 3 per
cent to Dollars 968.3m from Dollars 937.4m.
For the whole of 1992, CBS earned Dollars 81m, or Dollars 5.23, compared
with a loss of Dollars 85.8m, or Dollars 5.32 in 1991.
Income from continuing operations stood at Dollars 162.5m, or Dollars 10.51,
against a deficit of Dollars 98.7m, or Dollars 6.11 a year ago. Sales rose
15 per cent in the year to Dollars 2.5bn from Dollars 3.04bn.
Although the results were broadly in line with expectations, shares in CBS
slipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 200 1/8 in NYSE trading.
Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman and chief executive of the group, said the
television network returned to a modest level of profitability in 1992,
helped by improved results in entertainment, news and sports programming. He
said the company was also 'applying our resources in wiser, more
cost-effective ways.'
The strong growth in the network's prime-time ratings, which Mr Tisch said
was the biggest single-season gain by any network since 1976-77 lifted
revenues.
'We presently believe that CBS's 1993 operating earnings may surpass 1992's
level as a result of further gains in earnings at the television network,'
he said.

cent. After special items, attributable profits came to CDollars 87.3m, or
CDollars 1.43 a share, against CDollars 18.5m, or 39 cents in 1991.
Publishing and distribution earnings rose 13 per cent, while printing gained
18 per cent. Forest products turned round from losses to break even.
Quebecor is North America's second biggest commercial printer through

METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the Frankfurt mining and industrial conglomerate which
has in recent years been one of Germany's most acquisitive companies, is now
planning large-scale disposals.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive, told analysts yesterday the group
plans to make disposals to raise around DM1bn (Dollars 606m) over the next
two years. Capital investment is to be reduced by 40 per cent to DM1bn for
the current year.
He gave no indication of which companies were for sale, apart from saying
they would be non-core businesses and would not include any famous names.
This rules out Buderus - the heating products company which now has a
separate listing on the German stock-market - or any of the other industrial
companies acquired last year from Stora of Sweden in a DM1.45bn acquisition.
A list of potential sales targets has been drawn up, but a final decision on
which of the group's 258 subsidiaries are to be sold has yet to be taken.
Mr Schimmelbusch indicated that the group would be reducing the workforce -
which rose through acquisitions from 38,173 to 62,547 over 1991-92 - during
the the course of the year. But he gave no details of how many jobs would be
cut and in which divisions.
The disposals programme is a reaction to difficult market conditions for the
group. In the year to the end of September, group pre-tax profits fell 23
per cent to DM245m - the second successive year that profits have declined
sharply.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Kraft-RJR Nabisco deal faces
anti-trust challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK'S attorney-general, Mr Robert Abrams, yesterday filed an anti-trust
lawsuit to challenge Kraft General Food's Dollars 450m acquisition of RJR
Nabisco's cold cereal business, a month after the deal was completed.
Mr Abrams alleged that the acquisition decreased competition in an already
non-competitive industry and eliminated the possibility of a new competitor.
Kraft General Foods, the core US food division of Philip Morris, said it was
confident that the deal complied with anti-trust laws and was in the best
interests of competition and consumers.
Kraft added that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had carried out a
thorough investigation of the acquisition and had not objected to it.
Wall Street's reaction was muted. Shares in RJR Nabisco added Dollars 1/8 to
Dollars 8 3/4 and Philip Morris firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 73 7/8 .
Observers were surprised that a state official had decided to act after the
FTC had decided not to block the deal.
An earlier attempt by RJR to sell the cold cereal business to General Mills
was aborted after it became clear that federal anti-trust authorities were
likely to conduct a 'lengthy and prolonged review'.
Mr Abrams claimed that the price of ready-to-eat cereals had climbed 71 per
cent in the past eight years. 'These soaring price increases, far out of
line with other food products, are a clear result of an over-concentrated
industry. The General Foods-Nabisco deal will just make the problem worse,'
he said.

<TEXT>
CANARY WHARF and other developments in London's docklands were still
destined to become a 'symbol of prosperity', a defiant Mr John Redwood,
minister for local government and inner cities, told the Commons last night,
Ivor Owen writes.
His optimism was ridiculed by Mr Doug Henderson, shadow local government
minister, who said Canary Wharf had become 'the lost city of Wapping'.
Mr Redwood was taunted from the Labour benches over a forecast he made in
1988 that docklands would be seen as an example of the success of 'popular
capitalism', with Canary Wharf as globally famous as Trafalgar Square.
The minister was reminded he had said the government would recover the money
it had provided for the docklands development, over a 10-year period. Mr
Henderson said: 'Instead of getting the money back, the developers are
asking for more to save the project.'
Mr Redwood urged his critics to 'wait to see what happens yet'. He insisted
that Canary Wharf - which Mr Henderson said was 85 per cent empty - was
already a famous name.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ridley in call for 'burden sharing'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD RIDLEY of Liddesdale, the former cabinet minister Nicholas Ridley, last
night called for other nations to help bear the burdens of 'the world's
policemen' now carried mainly by the US, Britain and France.
In his maiden speech, Lord Ridley said he very much wanted to be in the
government's camp on defence, but he said he was 'frightened that overnight
the government will raise its tents and disappear into the darkness'.
He insisted that ministers had to approach the issue from a 'resources
angle'. Although the Cold War had ended, it had unleashed a whole maelstrom
of nationalism, Moslem fundamentalism and ancient ethnic conflicts and
tensions, he said.
Britain should continue to play its part in policing trouble spots, he said,
but 'the burden must be shared much more evenly . . . there are plenty of
rich nations in the world and they contribute nothing like their full share
of the cost of these operations'.
Former Labour defence secretary Lord Healey also said the time had come to
relate spending on defence with the country's economic situation.

Mr Zafy, a surgeon and leader of a democracy movement which had forced Mr
Ratsiraka to share power with a transitional government, took 70 per cent of
the votes in half the capital's polling stations.
A substantial part of the national results in the two-man run-off was

The voting was monitored by observers from Europe, the US and Africa.
Mr Zafy campaigned on the need for political reform and economic change in

FT  11 FEB 93 / German union leaders call protests over steel job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE union leaders in Germany called yesterday for mass protests by steel
workers, after reports that the newly-merged Krupp and Hoesch steel
companies plan to close down an entire plant in either Dortmund or Duisburg.
Union officials said that Mr Hans Wilhelm Grasshoff, chief executive of
Hoesch Stahl, told a meeting of union members at the Westfalenhutte plant
that company plans to cut monthly production capacity from 700,000 to
550,000 tonnes meant that an entire steel plant would have to close.
There was no formal confirmation last night from Hoesch Stahl, where a board
meeting was still in progress late into the evening.
The plan would be much more drastic than last week's joint announcement by
Krupp Stahl and Hoesch Stahl that one blast furnace would be closed down
temporarily because of the downturn in the steel market.
That proposal is for the furnace to shut down for five months. The
shut-down, beginning on March 1, will put 600 steel workers on short-time
working.
The growing backlash from the unions over a potential threat to as many as
25,000 steel jobs follows a call from the opposition Social Democrats (SPD)
in the German parliament for an emergency national congress of steelmakers,
unions, and central and state governments, to draft a plan of action to
tackle the growing crisis.
However, the steel industry in Germany has broadly welcomed the plan
proposed by the European Commission for an EC-wide response, including
capacity cuts in exchange for new state aid.
Mr Ruprecht Vondran, head of the German steel industry association, told an
emergency debate in the Bundestag yesterday that the proposals were close to
those put forward by the industry and the German parliament.
It was critical to see the final form which would emerge from negotiations
between the 12 member states.
He said the aim should be not merely to stop the slump in profits of
European steel-makers, but simultaneously to ensure a fair market for steel
products in the EC.
If the industry was expected to find a common way out of the crisis, then
all must operate on a clear legal basis, he added.
Subsidies to the industry had created a backlog of restructuring which would
be painful and costly to overcome.
The entire burden could not be put on the public purse, and the steelmakers
would have to pay for their own restructuring to a large extent, he said.
If one enterprise was expected to help its competitors to close down surplus
capacity, finance social programmes for redundant workers, or even create
alternative employment, it must be certain of being able to use higher
capacity itself in return, Mr Vondran said.
The industry must be protected from market dumping by competitors in eastern
Europe , and from producers who have been forced out of the US market by the
protectionist measures introduced by Washington.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE could consider narrowing the franc's present margin of fluctuation
against the D-Mark but only if it got some right to 'co-manage' such a
'D-Mark zone', a French opposition leader said yesterday.
Addressing a conference on 'Europe: the Way Ahead', sponsored by the
Financial Times and Les Echos, Mr Edmond Alphandery said the joint programme
of the UDF-RPR opposition parties, which are ahead in the polls for the
March election, was designed to reinforce Europe's integration and its
monetary system.
'This will necessitate without doubt a new Franco-German dialogue in the
monetary domain,' said Mr Alphandery, a UDF deputy who is tipped as a
possible finance minister if the opposition wins in March.
Mr Alphandery stressed there was no chance of any new centre-right
government devaluing the franc. It would, instead, seek to take monetary
policy out of the political arena by speedily introducing legislation to
make the Bank of France independent.
But the inherent 'instability' of the EMS, conceded by Mr Alphandery, led Mr
Peter Sutherland, chairman of the conference and of Allied Irish Banks, to
urge an immediate move to monetary union by a smaller number of EC countries
rather than waiting for 1997, the earliest date foreseen in the Maastricht
treaty. France, Germany, the Benelux countries, Denmark and Ireland, Mr
Sutherland said, 'could be ready to go ahead now. So why are we waiting?
There is nothing to suggest that conditions in 1997 will be any better than
they are now.'
Caution about rapid moves to economic and monetary union (Emu) came from Mr
David Band, chief executive of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Holdings. The lesson
of turbulence on the foreign exchanges was, he said, that 'economic
convergence has to precede exchange rate convergence'.
He objected that the pursuit of Emu had made the EMS too brittle.
Mr Jean-Pascal Beaufret, deputy director of the French Treasury, said that,
with Emu, capital markets would converge in the Community. But he suggested
this would stop short of the concentration that had taken place in the US,
with New York becoming the only major financial marketplace. He said equity
markets would remain largely national and he vaunted the merits of Paris.
Mr Gilles Menage, president of Electricite de France, said there was
effectively a single EC market in electricity already, with his own
state-owned utility exporting 13 per cent of its output. He called for
Brussels to take a 'less dogmatic' approach in introducing greater
competition.

FT  11 FEB 93 / US line on Bosnia welcomed at UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-awaited US peace initiative on Bosnia was welcomed at the United
Nations, not least because it puts an end to a period of uncertainty since
the stalled international negotiations on Bosnia moved from Geneva to New
York at the beginning of last week, and it offers an opportunity to break
the deadlock.
Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the co-chairmen of the conference on the
former Yugoslavia, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, said they welcomed the
decision by the US government 'to take an active role' in the peace process.
They were particularly pleased at the US commitment to help enforce any
settlement.
The two international mediators would 'go out of their way' to make
available to the new US envoy, Mr Reginald Bartholomew, all the information
at their disposal. Their assumption was that the Vance-Owen plan was still
on the table and would form the basis for further negotiations.
Mr Vance said later that he and 'Reggie' (Bartholomew) were old friends. 'He
is a fine person. I have worked with him for many years.'
Lord Owen described Mr Bartholomew as 'a serious professional', whose
appointment he welcomed. He had last spoken to him when he briefed Nato
ambassadors in Brussels in December. 'It was clear then that he was
well-versed in the (Bosnian) problem.'
In spite of the warm words of welcome, some anxiety was expressed in
conference circles about how Mr Bartholomew would go about his task.
The Americans were not coming to the negotiations with their own map but,
after talking to the warring parties, they would have to decide what changes
they wanted to propose to the Vance-Owen plan for dividing Bosnia into 10
semi-autonomous provinces.
As the representative of the US, which had openly expressed support for the
Bosnian Moslems, Mr Bartholomew would also have to establish the same kind
of impartiality that Mr Vance and Lord Owen had achieved in their dealings
with the warring parties.
That might be difficult in the case of the Bosnian Serbs, who have been
openly criticised by the US administration for their policies of ethnic
cleansing and territorial conquest.
Ralph Atkins reports in London: Mr John Major, UK prime minister, welcomed
the US move, saying the appointment of a representative would 'give added
impetus' to peace negotiations.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Brussels may set guidelines for steel output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is considering a new role as EC steel market
supervisor, setting guidelines on future production levels.
The plan, aimed at tackling Europe's steel industry crisis, is under review
in Brussels. But the Commission will stop short of dictating prices and
production levels to individual companies, like the 'crisis cartel' set up
by Viscount Etienne Davignon, then industry commissioner, during the early
1980s, EC officials stressed yesterday.
Under the proposals, Brussels would lay down recommendations on production
and delivery levels within the EC for each quarter. EC officials maintained
yesterday this would not encourage a cartel. 'We don't have to tell them
what to do,' said an EC official, 'and they don't have to phone each other.'
Another measure under review is for the steel industry to pool 'crisis
funds' for the restructuring of each individual sector.
The Commission is anxious to place the burden of decisions about
restructuring on Europe's steelmakers, and does not wish to be accused of
manipulating the market. But Brussels believes it has a vital role to play
as broker between steelmakers and governments.
EC officials said yesterday the Commission would make clear it is willing to
support an industry-wide restructuring plan only if Europe's steelmakers
produce a 'definite' closure programme by the end of September which can be
carried out by the end of 1994, according to a senior EC official.
A future rescue plan is also heavily dependent on the support of EC member
states which would have to bear a portion of the EC funding of up to Ecu900m
(Pounds 730m) to cover redundancy costs. The overall cost of restructuring
could be more than Ecu6bn, according to a report by Mr Fernand Braun, the
EC's special steel envoy.
But the Braun report warns that without a rescue plan involving some rise in
prices in the next few weeks or months, some of Europe's largest steelmakers
will see their cash flow dry up or turn negative by year-end.
The Braun report - delivered to the Commission last week - includes a range
of potential cuts in capacity which were put on the table by some 70
managing directors of EC steel companies in the past four months.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, has begun canvassing fellow
Commissioners' support and will have to present formal proposals next
Wednesday. The EC will discuss the steel industry crisis at a special
meeting on February 25.
The deepening recession forced steelmakers to raise earlier estimates of
possible capacity cuts to 25.8m tonnes of crude steel and 17.9m tonnes of
rolled products.
At least 50,000 jobs are likely to be lost in the plant closures, leading to
an estimated Ecu2.5bn in social costs and Ecu3.5bn in industrial costs,
according to the Braun report.
Certain manufacturers and governments in Spain, for example, are already
concerned that they will be forced to cut more capacity than they would
like. But Commission officials are adamant that this time the industry will
have to agree a closure plan first, before the rescue plan and EC funding
can then come fully into force.
'We are not going to launch all sorts of measures and just hope that in the
process these people will come up with capacity reductions,' said an EC
official.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Yen consolidates its strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE YEN yesterday consolidated its stronger position against both the dollar
and the D-Mark, as dealers continued to speculate on the possibility of a G7
accord to reduce the Japanese trade surplus, writes James Blitz.
The yen climbed to Y120.64 against the dollar before closing at Y120.90, up
from Y121.35. It finished at Y73.00 to the D-Mark, from a previous close of
Y73.42. In New York it ended at Y121.23 per dollar.
The Clinton administration has indicated that the Japanese trade surplus is
a matter of deep concern. But there was scepticism yesterday over whether US
and Japanese officials would agree to boost the currency further when they
meet this weekend.
According to Mr Mark Cliffe, chief economist at Nomura Securities in London,
the main policy debate in Tokyo is on how to boost the fiscal stimulus to
the economy rather than on raising interest rates.
Mr Neil Mackinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, said the Japanese
currency will not strengthen very much because interest rates in Tokyo are
unlikely to rise in the near term, limiting the returns for potential
investors.
He believes the yen could appreciate to Y65 to the D-Mark and that there may
be a test of the historic high of Y119.00 against the dollar, set on
September 28 last year. 'But I do not see the 16 to 20 per cent appreciation
in the yen/dollar rate which some people are suggesting,' he said.
Inside the European exchange rate mechanism, there were growing signs of
tension in spite of last week's cuts in the Bundesbank's official interest
rates.
The Bundesbank's decision to accept a tender for its repo at 8.50 per cent,
against 8.57 per cent last week, was widely expected by the market, although
it raised concern that German policy-easing was on the slow side.
The Belgian authorities raised their end-of-day support rate by 50 basis
points, to 9.3 per cent, to counter selling pressure on the Belgian franc.
The authorities have privately committed their currency to diverge by only a
limited amount against the D-Mark in the ERM grid. But dealers were
yesterday buying currency options to hedge against a weaker Belgian franc in
the event that the ERM breaks up - and this pushed the Belgian franc as much
as 30 basis points away from the D-Mark.
The Belgian currency was only 10 basis points weaker than the D-Mark on the
grid last night. But Mr Mark Austin, a Treasury economist at Midland Global
Markets in London, remained pessimistic. 'It is hard to believe that we will
get through the run-up to the French elections next month without fireworks
in the ERM,' he said.
Sterling yesterday traded more comfortably after two hair-raising days
against the D-Mark and dollar. It closed unchanged at DM2.3625 and slightly
easier at Dollars 1.4275. In New York it dipped to Dollars 1.4236.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Time for the UK to buck up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pessimism and self-hate about the UK economy has gone too far. Listening
to British businessmen denigrating British business performance induces a
desire to see what statistics of comparative performance really show.
As I have often remarked, they show that the rapid growth of other European
countries and Japan is mainly a catching-up phenomenon; and that in the
1980s relative UK performance started to improve. They suggest that it would
be rash to interpret the prolonged recession as a sign of deep structural
malaise.
Of course statistics can and often do lie. But it is so difficult to assess
anything as diverse as a country's total business and industrial performance
by personal impressions that the available numbers should be used as at
least a supplement.
The most intensive scrutiny of the available evidence so far comes from a
study by the distinguished economic historian, Professor Nick Crafts, in a
paper for the Institute of Economic Affairs entitled Can
De-Industrialisation Seriously Damage Your Wealth?. Because the paper
neither echoes the gloomy talk about a collapsing industrial base, nor the
once-more fashionable remedies of state aid for investment, it has been
largely ignored. But it has far more to tell us than we can expect from the
forthcoming report of the crystal-gazers assembled by the chancellor.
In fact, Crafts has a better chance of convincing those on the fence than
most other commentators. His paper is a survey of almost all the available
quantitative research, not only his own. He eschews ideology and indeed
speculative argument. So far is he from being a Thatcherite that he appeared
as a witness for Peter Jay in a television debate against the proposition
that there had been an economic miracle in the 1980s. Nor has he previously
been an IEA writer.
My only quarrel with Crafts is his use of the awful Harvard system in which
bracketed references such as (Joachim and Heifetz, 1985) clutter up the
text. They will not convince anyone who does not already believe the
author's thesis and are out of place in all but highly specialised original
studies. They should be replaced by plain English statements of the trend of
recent scholarship; references can be given in the bibliography.
In any case the substantive conclusion is that the gap in GDP per person
employed between the UK and European competitors is much less than the gloom
talk suggests. A table in Economic Viewpoint on November 19 suggested that
there is no gap compared with Japan either.
Admittedly, UK performance has lagged more in manufacturing than in the rest
of the economy. The big gap here is still with the US. American
manufacturing output per head was twice as high as Britain's in 1870, when
Mr Gladstone was presiding over his first effective administration. The
proportional gap was, at a maximum, around 1950 and has since been
declining.
The manufacturing gap with Continental Europe has never been so large as
with America. German manufacturing output per head was indeed nearly 50 per
cent above the UK's in 1977. But by 1989 the differential had fallen to 5
per cent. The gap with Japan (not shown in the chart) is similar.
Crafts also nails the myth of 'de-industrialisation'. Numbers employed in UK
industry have fallen more than in most other countries, but mainly because
the starting point was so high. By the late 1980s, the UK had much the same
proportion of the labour force in industry as several other countries with a
similar level of income per head - for example, France and the Netherlands.
It is Germany and Japan that are the odd countries out with their high
proportion employed in manufacturing.
Most interesting of all is his refutation of the supposed 'balance of
payments constraint on growth'. He notes, without becoming bogged down in
them, the arguments about the
validity of the 'trade gap' estimates, or about how much of the gap is the
result of inward investment, particularly by Japanese companies.
Crafts is prepared to accept that although the share of British exports in
world trade has more or less stabilised, the UK has an exceptionally high
tendency to devote increases in the national income to imports. This can be
offset by allowing the real exchange rate to depreciate by about 1 1/2 per
cent a year.
I should spell out that this need not mean a depreciation of the nominal
exchange rate - that is the rate quoted in the newspapers - by this amount.
If inflation by Britain's trading partners is, say, 3 per cent a year, then
a lower UK inflation rate of 1 1/2 per cent in traded goods and services
will suffice. On the other hand a larger nominal depreciation will fail to
do the trick if it is offset by inflation. Crafts concedes too much to the
Europhobic view that such adjustments would not be possible in the exchange
rate mechanism, mainly because he expects German inflation to be zero, which
would indeed be good news to the Bundesbank.
A falling real exchange rate is not a godsend, but perhaps a necessary evil.
It is normally accompanied by a deterioration in the terms of trade - that
is, UK citizens effectively receive less in imports for a given level of
exports. Crafts suggests that the effect is to reduce British living
standards by 0.4 per cent a year. This is not a trivial offset to an
underlying growth rate of 2 or 3 per cent, but hardly justifies the
prevailing gloom and doom.
Crafts devotes much attention to supposedly new theories which suggest that
there are large returns to investments, which are not captured by the
companies that make them, and that therefore government subsidy is
justified. He accepts the theoretical possibility, but cites much experience
showing that real world subsidies tend to retard rather than promote growth.
An example is the advanced gas-cooled reactor programme which is said to
have produced nothing of any commercial value over 20 years.
Moreover, John Smith please note. 'German policies to subsidise high
technology sectors like aircraft, nuclear energy and telecommunications have
been no more successful than British ones.'
Nor are these failures accidents. Politicians' incentives to win votes
encourage excessive subsidisation of producer interests and this cannot be
effectively monitored or deterred by the mass of voters on whom the costs
fall.
Crafts is very critical of some aspects of British business culture. The
vulnerability to hostile takeover, unique in Europe, causes British
companies to maintain dividends and forego investment opportunities in
development and training. He also criticises the absence of long-term
consensual relationships between UK workers and their companies.
But on balance he believes the reforms of the 1980s improved matters. The
main future emphasis should not be on subsidy for manufacturing or high
technology but the pursuit of multilateral international agreements to
reduce the extent of government support for industry and to promote freer
trade. And if multilateral agreements are elusive, I would go for unilateral
measures in this direction.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Letter: Housing policy a danger to standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHARLES A WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial ('Housing policy', February 5) makes absolute sense.
One of the great problems facing housing associations has been arbitrary
change in government regulation. It is happening again: in effect part of
the financial regime set up in 1989 is being dumped. In that regime housing
association grant has been calculated from a formula which included cost,
interest rates and affordability to tenants.
What is happening now is that (presumably) the Treasury is ordering a cut in
grant to 55 per cent in two years, which will drive rents well beyond the
reach of the low paid.
Certain MPs, particularly Sir Paul Beresford, have suggested that private
property developers should be allowed to compete with housing associations
for government grant. In my view this will lead to low construction
standards and uncertain standards of housing management.
Surely the lesson of the 1960s policy errors is that the drive to lower
costs is often misconceived. Housing associations are not perfect; nor are
they mad bureaucracies. It cannot be in the national interest to destroy
diversity and local accountability.

   From Mr NIGEL DE GRUCHY

<TEXT>
Sir, I have to challenge your assertion in your leader that the action being
contemplated by the NASUWT union and perhaps other organisations is a threat
to 'classroom peace'.
Nothing could be further from the truth. While the main concern of NASUWT is
the mountainous increase in workload, a successful boycott of the
government's over-prescriptive and distorting arrangements for national
curriculum testing and assessment would have beneficial effects for the
children.
The beneficial side-effect would be that teaching would be restored to the
classroom. The disruptive, distorting and bureaucratic nightmare being
imposed on pupils and teachers by the government's reforms would recede.
You also made the huge assumption that the government's version of testing
would help to raise standards. I believe the overwhelming majority of
teachers do not share your view.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leading article, 'Classroom peace' (February 9), makes eminent
commonsense. Teachers, for totally professional reasons and not because they
are so-called 'trendy lefties' intent on a fight with the government,
sincerely believe that students will suffer if the government this summer
presses ahead with its publication of English tests for 14-year-olds.
My union agrees with your conclusion, that the way out is for the government
to concede with good grace a year's delay in publishing the test results.
Sadly Mr John Patten, the education secretary, appears unwilling to listen.
Instead he appears to be looking for confrontation through a crude,
old-fashioned exercise of teacher-bashing.
He would receive praise not derision from teachers, and indeed parents, if
he put the interest of pupils before a dogmatic desire to discredit a very
caring profession.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Letter: Revenue staff cuts will carry a cost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLIVE BROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Jack's article, 'A taxman assesses years of change' (February
8), gives a somewhat misleading impression that Inland Revenue staffing has
remained much the same during the 1980s. The facts are quite dif-ferent.
In 1979 there were 86,000 Inland Revenue employees. That figure is now down
to 68,000, with 18,000 having been shed. And the government and the
department have plans - as yet unpublished - significantly to reduce staff
numbers further during the 1990s by shifting taxation administration on to
taxpayers and the private sector through moving towards a US-style
self-assessment system.
As the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants warns, this will carry
a cost - not simply in money terms, but in a changed relationship between
the Revenue and the taxpayer.
Your readers should know that it is rumoured that last year, for the first
time, the Revenue wrote off more than Pounds 1bn of unpaid taxes. While part
of that increased write-off without a doubt is attributable to the
recession, much in our view is due to the government's unwillingness to
employ the number of tax collectors required.
It is a strange world in which, while the government has to borrow ever more
and contemplate raising taxes to cope with a soaring public sector borrowing
requirement, it fails to recover a fair amount of what is due to it already
for the want of a relatively small number of staff.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Letter: Donor-aided research programme needs greater funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr P F A VAN LOOK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Not in the best of health' (February 4), quotes me as
having said that lack of money has not been a problem for research in human
reproduction and contraception.
Regrettably, this statement has been taken out of context and, as a result,
may give the impression that this field of research in general, and our
programme in particular, is well provided for. I wish this were true.
The special programme for research, development and training in human
reproduction is an international research programme. It is co-sponsored by
the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population
Fund, the World Health Organisation and the World Bank. The programme's
activities are financed, not from the WHO's regular budget, but from
voluntary contributions by some 20 developing and developed country
governments and organisations.
Until recently, these enlightened donors have been able to raise about 90
per cent of the programme's biennial funding targets. However, the fact that
donors have provided such support should not be taken to mean that there is
no funding shortage for the field in general or for our programme. It only
reflects the donors' strong commitment and realistic budgeting on our part.
I would point out that funding for our current 1992-93 two-year programme is
likely to reach only about 75 per cent of target because several of our
European donors are forced to reduce their budgets for overseas development
aid and a number of their currencies have recently been devalued.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Book Review: Monopoly seeks platonic relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION, PUBLIC OWNERSHIP AND THE REGULATION OF NATURAL MONOPOLY By C
D Foster Blackwell, Pounds 40, 458 pages
How does one find individuals who can be trusted to regulate important parts
of the economy? Such individuals have discretionary powers over many basic
goods and services, so only the select and most enlightened can do the job.
This question - which deliberately echos Plato's description of the
qualities required for a perfect ruler - is raised by Sir Christopher Foster
in his book on economic regulation. Like Plato, he is torn between
acknowledging that regulation is sometimes necessary, and realising that
power has a tendency to corrupt. Unlike Plato, his field of interest is not
society as a whole, but those parts of the economy that gravitate towards
monopoly if left to their own devices.
Sir Christopher, who has been an economics professor, civil servant and
businessman and is currently advising the UK government on the privatisation
of British Rail, rejects the idea that governments can pursue a policy of
benign neglect once they have privatised 'natural monopoly' industries such
as telecommunications, gas, railways, airports and electricity. But he is
exercised by the fact that any regulatory system is vulnerable to being
subverted.
Such subversion - known in the jargon as regulatory capture - can occur if
the regulator is turned into a tool of either the industry concerned or
politicians. The book is an extended treatise on how regulatory systems have
been consistently captured, and how the only antidote is a strong system of
regulation independent from vested interests.
This prescription may seem as idealistic as many of Plato's. But Sir
Christopher argues that, through a mixture of luck and foresight, the system
introduced in Britain to accompany the privatisation of utilities is a good
approximation to what is required. It is based on a series of independent
regulatory bodies - Oftel, Ofgas, Ofwat, Offer - headed by strong
individuals with considerable discretionary powers.
But the book is not an apologia for the British status quo. Sir Christopher
is concerned that regulators are still vulnerable to pressure from both
politicians and industry - a topical concern, given Sir James McKinnon's
decision this week to step down early as director-general of gas regulator
Ofgas, and the recent drubbing politicians have given Mr Stephen
Littlechild, director-general of electricity regulator Offer, for failing to
protect miners' jobs.
The book is also a timely contribution to the debate on how regulatory
systems should be designed, as yet more countries privatise utilities and
the UK embarks on its next privatisation wave with BR and maybe the Post
Office. Though not an easy read and sometimes repetitive, it is rich in
insights. Particularly appealing is its broad historical sweep, which traces
the development of economic regulation in Britain and the US.
The chapter on Gladstone's attempt to regulate railways in the 1840s shows
how the complex economic issues manifest today have been present from the
start. It also reveals how the railway barons were able to mobilise immense
lobbying power - at one point, 132 MPs were railway directors - to
emasculate his bill.
Further chapters explain how this early failure to control railway
monopolies led to such a public outcry, albeit after a time lag of nearly
half a century, that excessive controls were imposed. These, in turn, nearly
bankrupted the industry and paved the way for nationalisation.
The US experience with economic regulation, though less traumatic, does not
provide a model because it is too legalistic, according to Sir Christopher.
It is not simply that it is costly. The court-like procedures also enable a
monopoly to use its greater resources and control of information to tie its
regulator in knots.
These failures lead Sir Christopher to defend the current British model and
propose various measures to shore up the regulators' independence.
Some concern the vital but neglected subject of information. Monopolies not
only dominate their industries. They also control the detailed financial
information about how their industries work, putting them in a privileged
position compared with regulators, potential rivals and consumers. Though
regulators can ask for some information, the book argues that monopolies are
adept at playing games: dragging their heels, or flooding regulators with
irrelevant data.
Sir Christopher advocates stronger powers for regulators to extract
information and then publish it. This is partly to help potential rivals
enter a monopolised industry and partly because he favours 'sunshine'
regulation - exposing monopoly abuses to the glare of publicity.
Sunshine regulation was pioneered by Charles Francis Adams, a 19th century
Boston patrician, who waged a successful campaign against railway barons
through pamphleteering and journalism. Mr Alfred Kahn, taking a similar
approach, told his staff at the US Civil Aeronautics Board: 'If you can't
explain what you are doing to people in simple English, you are probably
doing something wrong.'
The new breed of British regulator has developed its own version of sunshine
regulation. Sir James McKinnon, in particular, has been a master of the
strongly worded statement to the press - a practice Sir Christopher
applauds, since it helps regulators build up public support, which in turn
should act as a bulwark against interference with their independence.
Much of Sir Christopher's argument for independent regulators is persuasive.
But it ultimately rests - as did Plato's - on enlightened individuals
filling the top posts. For, as Sir Christopher acknowledges, if bad
regulators were to be in charge, it might after all be better if they were
shackled by a cage of law.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Arts: Dylan - Pop concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What drives Bob Dylan on to tour and tour again remains a profound mystery.
The never-ending circuits of the world must fulfil some deep psychological
need that a more sedentary form of existence could not. For Dylan to stay in
seclusion, dispensing the occasional album with the seigneurial flourish
befitting a rock legend of his luminosity obviously would not suit him. Yet
there is no evidence that he takes any obvious delight in the contact with
his fans; for two hours he gives and the audience takes, while not a word is
spoken and smiles are strictly rationed.
It is an uncomfortable prospect; there are too many gruesome reports from
around the world of an apparently bored Dylan going through the motions
oblivious of surroundings while his band does its best to second-guess the
next move, to approach any appearance with positive expectations. Tuesday's
concert was the third in Dylan's week-long London run. By his standards it
was a relaxed and involved affair; at times he seemed almost perky. It was
also, in its way, totally spell-binding.
There were plenty of ragged edges (does this man ever rehearse a song from
beginning to end, one wonders?), a sprinkling of miscalculations (usually
involving the harmonica), but never a hint that he was anything but fully
engaged. His current four-piece band has a country-rock feel, leavening its
heavyweight guitars and drums with string bass, slide guitar and mandolin;
that sound was laid down at the very start of the set, moving from 'Maggie's
Farm' through 'Every Grain of Sand' and 'Tangled Up in Blue' (the resilience
of this song in particular tested almost to destruction) on to a fierce,
unforgiving 'All Along the Watchtower' which gradually built in intensity
and concentrated Dylan's efforts ever more. The same kind of momentum was
generated at the end of the evening, by which point it was possible to
adjudge that Dylan was, really, enjoying himself.
Perhaps that is the point. It is the search for the fix that comes from the
occasional great performance which keeps him going, so that each concert is
an experiment, an attempt to find another means to that end. How else to
explain the constant worrying away at the lyrics and the melodic lines? In a
treasurable acoustic set halfway through Dylan refurbished something of his
most familiar songs from the sixties. There was nothing arbitrary or wilful
about it - the tender way in which 'Mr Tambourine Man' was recast, shorn of
its yearning vocal line and delivered as an introverted chant complete with
haunted harmonica coda, or 'Don't Think Twice' had its melody completely
recast seemed anything but arbitrary. For the fans hearing those songs now
may be a precious exercise in nostalgia; for Dylan still, extraordinarily,
they carry the potential for renewal and refinement.
At the Hammersmith Apollo until Saturday

FT  11 FEB 93 / Arts: Woody the wizard - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS

<TEXT>
SHADOWS AND FOG (15) Woody Allen
OLIVIER OLIVIER (15) Agnieszka Holland
THE LIVING END (18) Gregg Araki
STAY TUNED (PG) Peter Hyams
Woody Allen's deliciously strange Shadows And Fog is about the Known and the
Unknowable. Part tragedy, part comedy; part human puppet-show, part
charabanc tour through the dark night of the soul; it is a fantasy prelude
in film noir tones to the later Husbands And Wives.
In America many hated it: mainly because there are so many plots bubbling at
once that it is like being in a mad wizard's kitchen. We have Allen himself
as Mr Kleinman, the bumbling coward roped into a posse hunting a mass killer
in a European town. We have circus sword-swallower Mia Farrow, flouncing out
on husband John Malkovich after he has slept with trapeze artist Madonna. We
have the star-packed brothel (Kathy Bates, Lily Tomlin, Jodie Foster) where
Farrow spends a fugitive night. We have Farrow-smitten student John Cusack;
mad doctor Donald Pleasence; neighbour Kate Nelligan . . .
Whoah. Enough, you cry. How many films are being reviewed here under one
title? But the multi-story skittishness of Shadows And Fog is its charm. If
Husbands And Wives gave us the first great film from a new, free-associating
Woody - conventional style and structure splintering under the power of
improvised emotion - Shadows And Fog is like a gentler dressage for that
drama of deconstruction.
Across the dinky squares, through the picture-book fog and darkness, lope
the funny-mysterious Lilliputians. In style the film is a toy-theatre spoof
on German Expressionism, doing for Lang and Murnau what Love And Death did
for Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. But Shadows And Fog is also about good and evil,
destiny and predestination. Herr Kleinman - Allen with specs and nervous
soliloquies - knows he has been 'chosen' but cannot figure out what for.
Farrow's runaway circus girl leaps into her fated midnight and finds a fated
self-fulfilment. (She links up with Allen in what may be their last and most
touching boy-meets-girl vignette.) And Doc Pleasence, pondering a morgueful
of corpses, gazes straight and steely-eyed into the heart of life, death and
the beyond.
Though Carlo Di Palma's black-and-white photography mimics a gloom-laden
cine-Europe of 60 years ago, the film is also free-spirited enough to throw
in some prime Woody repartee. (Farrow: 'I slept with one man for money. Does
that make me a whore?' Allen: 'Only by the dictionary definition.') And a
classically deft scene of romantic misunderstanding between Cusack and
Malkovich shows that the director does not save all the good laughs for
himself.
But Shadows And Fog is best when comedy balances on a knife-edge of the
macabre; when the inquisitive despair that Allen over-formalised in his
Chekhov-Bergman pieces (Interiors, September) is given the true texture of
filmic malaise - human fear and defiance glittering in the shadows of the
unknowable.
When a film comes to a sudden narrative pause and flashes up the title
'Paris, six years later,' we fear the worst. Either the characters who were
children will have grown up to become unrecognisable adults. Or those who
were grown-ups will be the same actors with a wisp of grey hair and a look
of telegraphic disenchantment.
But Agnieszka Holland's powerfully imaginative Olivier Olivier skips over
every lurking trap. In part one nine-year-old Olivier disappears from his
rural home - never seen again after leaving to take food to Granny (yes,
shades of Red Riding Hood) - and parents Francois Cluzet and Brigitte Rouan
are split apart by sobs and recriminations. In part two 15-year-old Olivier
is tracked down by Paris cop Jean-Francois Stevenin and restored to his
ecstatic parents and startled sister.
But is it Olivier? The questionable resemblance of new actor to old has the
audience clucking scornful scepticism: only to be out-clucked by the movie
itself as it sows doubts in the midst of delight and then delivers a
knock-out denouement.
Taken from a newspaper item, the story grows its own reality like a cutting
newly planted in rich soil. One-time co-screenwriter with Wajda (Man Of
Iron, Danton), Agnieszka Holland has learned the art of
more-comes-from-less. The film never stops to 'explain' its characters. The
stormy father, the besotted mother; the enigmatic sister with her
sacrificial rites and mystic powers (from self-inflicted cigarette burns to
telekinesis); the teenage Olivier's moody inconsistency of recall. The
characters are 'givens' who create their own human weather system, as alien
and yet as recognisable as the sirocco. And domestic trivia, from a
squalling cat to the musical beds of sleepless children climbing in with
sighing adults, become the meteorology of changing emotion.
Gregg Araki's The Living End is an AIDS-era road movie and as dotty as that
sounds. Two HIV-positive Californians, bookish Jon and hellraising Luke,
throw themselves into each other's arms and then onto the open road in this
film that resembles a cross between a gay Badlands and a Wild At Heart for
sexual militants. Casual murders; lots of outlaw lyricism; and a sense of
two people narcissistically narrating their own lives as they glide
attitudinisingly towards death.
Jon (Craig Gilmore) is a film critic writing a thesis on the 'Death of
Cinema'. (No comment.) Luke is a drama queen with bronzed pectorals who
wants to blow his brains out during a final dazzling orgasm. When not giving
screen time to these tinpot tragic heroes, debut director Araki branches out
into caricatured women. These range from two loudmouthed lesbians scripted
for penis-envy dialogue to a Bette Davis lookalike with pillbox hat and
kitchen knife. This last floats into an early love scene between Luke and a
pick-up, delivers the line 'This isn't the Seventies any more, you know' and
stabs the pick-up to death.
Reality? Fantasy? Comedy? Horror? Who knows. Who, alas, cares. Mark this
down as the first, worst film of a director who may improve when he empties
his system of gay special pleading and camp melodramatics.
Stay Tuned is, if possible, worse. Married couple John Ritter and Pam
Dawber, Faustians of the hi-fi age, have adventures in a nightmare TV-land
run by Satan figure Jeffrey Jones. Sucked into this 'other world' via a
giant satellite dish, they become actors in spoof shows like The Golden
Ghouls, Meet The Mansons and Northern Overexposure.
The cod titles are the funniest thing. Elsewhere this is fast, frenetic,
fun-free tripe: scripted by ex-advertising duo Tom Parker and Jim Jenewein
and directed by Peter Hyams.
To conjure the true spirit of comedy this week requires necromancy. The late
Buster Keaton, greatest of silent comics, unlocks his stone-faced splendour
in a season at the Barbican. Sherlock Junior is joined by two classic
shorts, The Love Nest and The Playhouse, in a programme no connoisseur of
mute mirth should miss. (But be warned: the odd sound effect has been added
to Sherlock).
The opposite of a comedian who never speaks is a film-maker whose characters
never shut up. A sad farewell to Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who died last Friday.
He spent his life wiring great film stars for sound, plugging them in and
then standing back to watch the mixture of noise, sparks and explosions. He
twinned Brando and Gielgud in Julius Caesar. He set Olivier and Caine at
each other's larynxes in Sleuth. And in All About Eve, starring Bette Davis
and a famous line about bumpy nights, he made the most glorious impostor
among movies. It pretends to be a film; it is really a stage play with a
camera breathing down its neck. But who objects? No movie ever matched its
glittering, sideswiping dialogue or its showman's wisdom about show
business.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Arts: Richard III - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The story goes that in previous centuries actors playing Richard III would
shift their deformity from left to right from night to night. This reduced
the risk of back problems such as have afflicted Simon Russell Beale who had
to withdraw from the RSC's production at the Donmar Warehouse because of a
slipped disk.
Beale will return to the part at Stratford next month. Meanwhile Richard has
been taken over by Ciaran Hinds, an actor in an altogether different mould.
Beale is small and agile, almost double-jointed. Hinds is physically large
and, in this part at least, deliberately clumsy.
Visitors to the Warehouse will have recently seen Hinds playing Samuel Byck
in Stephen Sondheim's Assassins, and Richard III is an appropriate play to
follow, for what is it about but a series of assassinations? Richard like
Assassins is directed by Sam Mendes and some of the techniques are becoming
familiar: for instance, the use of the separate cubicles at the back of the
stage.
The production was seen at the Other Place in Stratford last summer. It is
not the best that Mendes has done. The costumes, located loosely somewhere
early in the 20th century, are dull. There is not enough to differentiate
the characters. Too much of the play comes across as a pageant without
spontaneity. Possibly one is over-influenced by the Northern Broadsides
production, seen at the Riverside Studios in December, and has come to
expect Richard III to be fun. Mendes's production is a little too like a
run-up to Macbeth without the poetry and without the depth. He treats it too
much as history and not enough as melodrama.
Nevertheless, there are some excellent scenes and one sub-theme in
particular is played for all it is worth. This is the relationship between
Richard and Buckingham which becomes central to the plot. Stephen Boxer's
Buckingham is not just another toad or accessory to the crimes. He is the
man who, like Lady Macbeth with her husband, urges Richard on. Later, again
like Lady Macbeth, he quails and Richard knows when to drop him. In the
early stages of this production, Buckingham is almost the best part in the
play: Boxer is outstanding.
Then there is the set-piece towards the end when the ghosts of his victims
come to visit Richard in his dream on the eve of battle. Mendes directs this
as if it takes place in a subdued tavern in Cheapside. Richard sits slumped
over his wine at one end of the table. At the other end is Richmond, the
future Henry VII. The ghosts come in together and drink round the table to
Richmond's victory. There is Mendes at his best. He is less happy in
handling the women in general who, most of the time, simply record and
prophecy doom. He does not catch their fickleness in the way they can
succumb to Richard.
On the small Donmar stage, Hinds suffers for his size. His hump looks like a
pillow, even a kitbag, strapped across his shoulders. He has sleeked back
hair and an off-putting long brown coat. Yet when he plays Richard as the
religious devotee, pretending to be reluctant to accept the crown, he seems
a much more versatile actor. Still, playing the role as a hulking straight
murderer is a perfectly legitimate interpretation. I enjoyed it.
Donmar Warehouse (071) 867 1150. The production runs until February 20, then
moves to Tokyo and Rotterdam, before going home to Stratford

FT  11 FEB 93 / Arts: Schubert on the South Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The South Bank Schubert series, now well underway, is a lop-sided one, with
all the interesting events happening at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. This is
where we are hearing the chamber music written for intimate evenings among
the composer's circle of friends, although it cannot have been the intention
of the organisers that their audiences should be the same kind of size.
This part of the series lasts until March. There are string quartets, piano
sonatas and duets, some songs. Best of all, on Tuesday, was the only truly
novel item - a selection of Schubert's partsongs, which proved so
entertaining that some in the audience may have gone away to look out more.
There are plenty of them, too: three full pages listed in Grove, no less.
Can they all be so imaginatively varied?
Many of these pieces were written for specific occasions, which will explain
why Schubert tried his hand at some unusual combinations of voices and
instruments. One father, wanting to celebrate the convalescence of his
dance-mad daughter, commissioned the lively 'Der Tanz'. Several of the more
ambitious songs, including 'Nachtgesang im Walde', a Lied that has outgrown
its origins, have a quartet of horns in support.
In among these trifles, however, are at least a few minor masterpieces. It
is difficult to resist Schubert's setting of the 23rd Psalm ('The Lord is my
Shepherd') and especially when its wide-eyed innocence is as beautifully
caught as it was here by the ladies of the BBC Singers accompanied by Imogen
Cooper. Then again, the 'Gesang der Geister uber den Wassern', for male
octet with a quintet of lower strings, looks far ahead of its time to
becoming a 'serious song' in the Brahms manner, mellow, pensive, richly
textured.
In every item the BBC Singers were on expert form, holding in check the
individual voices which wobbled away during the recent Janacek weekend. Sian
Edwards conducted, a relaxing duty, one imagines, before ENO
responsibilities claim her attention. The partsongs were preceded by the
Chilingirian String Quartet in the A Minor Quartet, undemonstrative and
affectionate Schubert playing, which captured the Landler spirit nicely.
Unfortunately the Borodins' recording was fresh in my mind and this was not
its equal.
Schubert series continues at the Queen Elizabeth Hall until 2 March (Box
Office 071-928 8800)

A beast called the Devilfish, an enormous octopus which swims in the south
Pacific, is the subject of Wildlife on One (BBC 1, 8.00). Hard, really, to
think of anything nastier than a creature which may be 16ft long, is
boneless and changes its shape at will. It pounces on its prey, which it
embraces, poisons, and then digests. Yet perhaps we should beware of
misjudging a beast which is considered intelligent and endowed with
emotions.
Close To Home (C4, 8.00), delves into a classic and unattractive case of
'nimbyism' (ie. 'Not In My Backyard') in Manchester. Residents are indignant
because the Probation Service is turning hotels in their areas into bail
hostels. Never mind that it is immeasurably fairer and cheaper to get
defendants into hostels and out of prison. The 'nimbies' protest that vodka
bottles get thrown across the fence into their gardens. .
The Essential History of Europe: Belgium (BBC 2, 8.00) scrutinises the
entrails of Belgium. It presents that country as a land of terrific
gastronomy but, in terms of national identity, a total wash-out.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Arts: Holzmair &amp; Tan - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Wigmore Hall on Monday, the baritone Wolfgang Holzmair sang two dozen
Romantic songs, accompanied by Melvyn Tan at a fortepiano. Their
umbrella-title was 'Zwielicht' (twilight), but that placed no serious limits
on the range of the programme: any song seemed to qualify so long as it
mentioned the moon, the stars or both. That left room for nocturnal delights
and horrors, storms and dewy calm, knights, hunters and lovers; and the
whole recital gave unqualified pleasure.
In a certain style of Lieder singing, Holzmair is a very model. The voice
has a marked personal character, and he wields it with communicative flair.
He indulges no great variety of vocal colour (and his tone is thin in the
lowest register), though he likes to float soft, high-lying phrases on a
cultivated head-voice. Nor does he underline or italicise key words, unlike
some senior platform stars; and yet verbal sense is always foremost - every
part of every song has something to say, whether vehement or sweetly
reasonable.
For this kind of delivery, Tan's fortepiano (quite a large one) made the
perfect backing. Not only because its light, brittle tone was guaranteed
never to cover the voice, nor because it resembled the instruments
Mendelssohn, Schubert and Schumann knew far better than any modern grand;
but also because Tan allows himself a degree of expressive licence, in
impeccable period style, which is virtually unheard of among modern
accompanists.
Rhythms can be delicately bent (his treatment of the repeated chords on
Schumann's 'Mondnacht' was marvellous), inner voices enhanced by spontaneous
rubato. None of that was a distraction from the singing, since the
fortepiano's scale of sound is so unthreatening; but it lent life and pretty
surprises to all the music, complementing Holzmair's direct, seemingly
artless manner - which by itself might have begun to seem a bit over-plain.
Tan's exuberant mannerisms, in the purely visual sense, were another matter
(had I been Holzmair, whose own bearing is modest and decorous, I should
have been tempted to swat him); but if that kind of carrying on is what he
needs to achieve such fresh results, one must not complain. Predictably,
Mendelssohn's piano-parts sounded delectable on the instrument. Much less
predictably, its limited capacity for sustaining sound - for Schumann, the
usual pedalled richness a la Steinway was simply unavailable - inspired Tan
to find all kinds of compensation in phrasing and highlights. He and
Holzmair made a curious partnership, but a most successful and satisfying
one.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Selling coffee to
the Brazilians - The world's largest coffee producer is fighting to maintain
its home market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From plush government ministries in Brasilia to humble wattle and daub homes
in the poverty-stricken north-east it is impossible to go anywhere in Brazil
without being offered a cafezinho, a small cup of strong black coffee so
full of sugar that a spoon stands up in it.
It is such a national symbol that last year, when the presidency wanted to
convey to the people the full gravity of the country's economic crisis, it
stopped serving cafezinhos in its offices. Surely the world's largest
coffee-producing country does not need to advertise the stuff to its own
people.
Yet Brazil is currently in the throes of an advertising blitz on television
and in magazines to promote the world's favourite pick-me-up. Supermarkets
are handing out leaflets and recipe cards and taste stands have become a
common sight at conferences and seminars in the latest stage of the
Brazilian coffee industry's first-ever promotion campaign.
For while Brazil remains the world's second largest consumer, per capita
consumption has plummeted by almost 50 per cent in the last 10 years. The
worried coffee industry started to respond in 1989 - initially through
targeting retailers and trying to encourage the public to differentiate
between blends and become more discriminating. Latterly, the generic
campaign - which has cost more than Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) and is the
first of its kind by any sector of the Brazilian food and drink trade - has
been aimed more directly at consumers.
Nowhere is more associated with coffee than Brazil. It has been grown there
since 1727, after a goatherd in Ethiopia discovered his charges became more
frisky whenever they ate coffee beans. Brazil is now responsible for 25 per
cent of world production though coffee is no longer the basis of its
economy.
Always focused on exports, the Brazilian coffee industry until recently paid
little attention to the home consumer. As a result the local population
thought it was being fobbed off with inferior products and began turning to
other beverages such as tea or juice.
In 1988 a study commissioned by the Brazilian Coffee Roasters and Grinders
Association found that 67 per cent of Brazilians thought that 'all good and
pure coffee was exported and that sold in Brazil was impure and of low
quality'.
This was partly true. Years of government price controls meant that the
local industry had no incentive to produce better coffee for the domestic
market. However, since 1989 a world glut and falling international prices
has intensified the need to build up the home market. America Sato,
president of Abic, explains: 'It has become essential for our survival to
recapture Brazilian consumer confidence in the quality of our coffee.'
In its study Abic found that Brazilian per capita consumption had dropped
from 4.6kg per annum to 2.8kg since the 1970s and was falling off rapidly.
'We were ceding space to other drinks and there is a big potential for
increase,' Sato says.
As a first step the industry created a 'self-monitoring and purity control
programme', establishing the Abic seal of quality and contracting
consultants Peat Marwick and Ernst &amp; Young to oversee a constant evaluation.
The seal is now on 80 per cent of coffee for domestic consumption.
The 600 members of Abic united to invest Dollars 2m a year in marketing. 'If
we were to reconquer the consumer it had to be through an institutional
campaign rather than just separate companies advertising their own
products,' says Sato.
Abic contracted the Sao Paulo-based Rino advertising agency with the aim of
increasing total consumption by 20 per cent in the next two years to 11m
bags (each 60kg). Rino Ferrari, who heads the campaign, says: 'It is a major
challenge. Coffee has a serious problem in Brazil. It's not just a matter of
saying coffee tastes good, but of totally changing the image of coffee.'
The liberation of prices in 1991 meant that the industry could concentrate
on quality for the home market and the latest stage of the campaign focuses
on quality and diversification. Sato explains: 'In the past all coffee in
Brazil was seen to be equal and of a lower standard. Now we're saying
'coffee is different and each consumer has his or her own palate so buy
accordingly'.'
The television ads currently showing during prime time show a group of
different people, all wearing the same mask, under the slogan: 'Purity you
must demand. Quality you should choose.'
The aim is to make consumers aware that coffee comes in different flavours
and aroma resulting from different types of beans and degrees of roasting.
Rino is also distributing free recipe cards and running adverts in women's
magazines to show the different potential uses of coffee - in cakes, ice
cream and Irish coffee, for example. Ferrari says: 'We're aiming at everyone
over 25 from all social classes but the real ambition is to get the habitual
consumer to drink more, be more selective in the purchase and more
adventurous in the use.'
To encourage publicity an annual prize has been set up for reporting on
coffee and Abic has started its own newspaper. An accord has been signed
with Campinas University to monitor consumer reaction.
The next step is a Dollars 2m promotion of coffee as a stimulant, aimed at
young people whom Abic has found begin drinking coffee only after starting
work. 'Coffee is seen as Brazil's national drink throughout the world,' says
Ferrari. 'We have to make sure Brazilians keep drinking it.'

FT  11 FEB 93 / Technology: CFCs get the cold shoulder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's Candy white goods group this week unveiled what it says are the
world's first mass-produced refrigerators which work without
environment-damaging chlorofluorocarbons.
The new fridges use HFC 134a, an alternative chemical which is now the
front-runner to replace CFCs in refrigerator applications. Unlike CFCs, HFC
134a does not harm the earth's ozone layer. It is in commercial production
by ICI and Du Pont.
The Candy range, which is being introduced two years ahead of a European
Community accord to phase out CFCs by 1995, may soon be followed by other
leading manufacturers. A number of European companies are believed to be
working on CFC-free fridges, some of which may be unveiled at next week's

Although the new range does not include CFC refrigerant, it is still only a
half-way house as far as the use of chemicals for insulation is concerned.
For their insulating material the Candy fridges use HCFC 141b gas, a
hydrochlorofluorocarbon which Candy admits is 'a transitory solution'.
Although the chemical dissipates in the atmosphere 10 times faster than
CFCs, researchers are still working on an environmentally harmless solution
for insulation use.
Silvano Fumagalli, chairman of Candy's main operating company, said the
group, like other big white goods makers, was looking into the use of
cyclopentane as an alternative. Experimental fridges using cyclopentane are
already believed to have been tested.
However, the gas is dangerous to handle and foam produced from it is a less
effective insulator than that from HCFC 141b.
Fumagalli said Candy was working closely with chemical companies in the
search for suitable alternatives. The new Candy fridges already marked a
step forward in eliminating CFCs without compromising operating standards,
he said.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Technology: Searching for a clearer picture of the future -
After European HDTV's expensive crash, Della Bradshaw, Louise Kehoe and
Michiyo Nakamoto ask what can be salvaged from the wreckage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The single European market is only one month old, yet the community's
flagship technology project has already foundered.
The high-definition television strategy promised to bring cinema-quality
pictures to Europe's television screens, by imposing a single standard,
HD-Mac, on Europe's broadcasters. But that promise now seems increasingly
hollow.
'The European Commission's approach has been most unfortunate,' says Philip
Carse, a consultant at National Economic Research Associates (Nera) in
London. 'It has backed a standard which is becoming more obsolete by the
minute.'
For the European taxpayer the bill for research and development into HDTV
runs into hundreds of millions of pounds. But the cost to Europe's
struggling electronics companies is more than monetary.
They have now missed the opportunity to accrue manufacturing experience in
the latest technologies, while Japanese manufacturers have grasped the
opportunity with both hands. Japanese broadcasters, too, are garnering
experience in programme making for HDTV.
But as manufacturers sift through the bones of Europe's high-profile
venture, many experts are increasingly sceptical that consumers would have
paid for a technology which brought only incremental improvement in the
quality of the television picture.
'My view was that it would always be a slow take-up,' says John Forrest,
chief executive of NTL, the privatised transmitter and engineering arm of
what was the UK's Independent Broadcasting Authority. 'The question was
whether people would be prepared to pay to switch from pretty good quality
television to HDTV. It was not the same jump as from black-and-white
television to colour.'
Even the most ardent proponents of HDTV acknowledge that the full benefits
of the improved picture cannot be achieved on the standard 21- or 23-inch
television set. Initially viewers would probably need projection television
 -where the picture is broadcast like an old-fashioned home movie on to a
screen. As technology developed, large flat-screen television sets would be
used, but for these viewers would probably have to wait until the next
century.
HDTV promises a better-quality picture because it crams more picture
elements, or pixels, into each square inch of the screen. While conventional
TV pictures have 120,000 pixels, HDTV has about 700,000.
The fundamental dilemma was whether consumers would even notice the
difference. To the exasperation of many television engineers, viewers appear
quite content to watch fuzzy pictures on tiny portable televisions with
aerials made out of wire coathangers. And most viewers are prepared to
ignore, or at least tolerate, the deterioration in picture quality when
watching a programme which has been recorded at home on a VCR.
Perhaps the biggest factor pointing to the demise of HD-Mac was that it was
developed for satellite and cable transmission only. In the UK, for example,
only 12 per cent of homes are connected to such services - most viewers
receive their programmes through a network of terrestrial transmitters.
Carse, one of the authors of a recent Nera report on HDTV, compiled in
conjunction with Brunel University, says that if the analogue HD-Mac system
were implemented in Europe only about 5 per cent of viewers would take up
the service.
In Japan, NHK, the national broadcaster, has also opted for analogue HDTV
technology which therefore can only be broadcast on satellite and cable. NHK
has been broadcasting daily eight-hour doses of programmes in High Vision,
the Japanese name for HDTV, which the public can view at more than 450
points in public areas, such as railway stations and public halls.
Although NHK and consumer electronics manufacturers have kept up the
publicity in a concerted effort to maintain the momentum - November 11 has
even been named national High Vision day since the Japanese system uses 1125
lines - there is growing scepticism about Japan's chosen path.
High Vision has been introduced at a time when grim economic news has
largely extinguished consumer interest in expensive, highly sophisticated
luxury electronic goods. The cost of a HDTV set in Japan is at least Y1m
(Pounds 5,300).
To compound the problem, public knowledge of digital television is
increasing, and the improved picture-quality of High Vision seems to pall in
the face of what digital television could offer - better information
services, interaction with computers and, above all, superior picture and
sound quality.
For the broadcaster, digital signalling brings other advantages. At least
four times as many digital channels can be squeezed into a given amount of
broadcast capacity as analogue ones. That means that one or two
high-definition channels could be transmitted in the capacity used today for
a conventional signal. Digital signals also use only one thousandth of the
power of their analogue counterparts.
Everyone acknowledges that eventually everybody will go digital - the only
question is when. The US government has decided to skip the analogue phase
altogether. The Federal Communications Commission has recently completed
technical tests of five proposed HDTV systems and a panel of FCC testers is
meeting in Washington this week to prepare a preliminary decision on which
should become the US standard.
The Advisory Committee is scheduled to bring its recommendation to the full
FCC at the end of this month and a final decision should then be reached by
the summer. 'The FCC intends to double the number of broadcast stations in
the US, with the new stations being dedicated to HDTV service,' says Jerrold
Heller, executive vice president of General Instrument's VideoCipher
Division, in San Diego, which has developed DigiCipher, one of the five
systems being tested.
The advisory committee could select a single system but seems increasingly
likely to recommend a combination of two approaches.
If all goes according to schedule, then the first HDTV sets should be
available to consumers by mid-1995 or early 1996, at a price of up to
Dollars 3,500 (Pounds 2,300). Prices are expected to come down quickly with
volume manufacturing, but even at Dollars 1,000 an HDTV set would be between
two to four times as expensive as a television set in the US today.
In Europe it looks increasingly as if viewers will have to wait until the
introduction of a digital system before they will be able to view HDTV. Rob
van Oostenbrugge, European television development manager at Philips, the
company which precipitated the European crisis by announcing it would not be
manufacturing HDTV sets this year as previously planned, believes it will be
at least 2000 before a digital standard can be adopted in Europe. Others
believe digital broadcasts could be introduced via satellite more rapidly.
In the meantime, the demise of the European version of HDTV means European
television viewers will continue to face a plethora of standards - Pal,
Secam, Pal Plus, D2-Mac.
'It will only become worse not better,' complains van Oostenbrugge. This
proliferation of standards will fragment the marketplace further and drive
up costs to the consumer, he argues.
For European broadcasters and electronics manufacturers, digging among the
ashes of HD-Mac, the news is not all gloomy. Numerous developments can be
retrieved and exploited.
Although the picture transmission part of the HD-Mac specification is
analogue, much of the studio technology and that used in the television sets
themselves is digital, and could be developed for use with a digital
high-definition system.
What the consumer will see more quickly is the proliferation of wide-screen
television sets, an interim step on the way to HDTV. Wide-screen sets have
screens with a height to width ratio of 16:9 compared with 4:3 for
conventional box-shaped sets. The wide-screen format also brings slightly
better picture quality.
European broadcasters are already beginning to broadcast some programmes -
notably films - in the wide-screen format and manufacturers are selling the
new sets in Scandinavia, France and Germany.
The options for European broadcasters when selecting the digital HDTV
standard will be numerous. A Scandinavian group which includes the Swedish
Broadcasting Corporation and the Swedish Television Company, for example,
has developed a prototype system for digital terrestrial HDTV called
HD-Divine (digital video narrow-band emission).
And in the UK, NTL has developed a system for the Independent Television
Commission which squeezes digital signals between the existing analogue
signals. The spaces are 'no go' areas for further analogue signals as these
would interfere with those already there.
A third option would be to adopt the same system as the US. The likelihood
of this increases if Japanese manufacturers and broadcasters also decide to
follow the US in digital broadcasting.
While European manufacturers and broadcasters puzzle over the next move,
their Japanese counterparts are forging ahead, gaining invaluable experience
on how to best exploit HDTV in programme making and equipment manufacturing.
By waiting for a digital standard, manufacturers in the US are in pole
position to determine a world standard for digital high-definition
broadcasts.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Soft approach keeps
toilet paper ads rolling - Andrex's plans to take its puppy campaign to the
Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1942, Andrex Surgical Toilet Wadding established a set of brand values
which, in 50 years, have hardly changed.
Today it is difficult to imagine any consumer goods company running
advertising with the same blatant snob-price appeal; yet premium pricing
remains the foundation of Andrex's extraordinary success.
That success was demonstrated recently by market research which puts Andrex
into fourth place in the league table of UK brands sold through grocers. On
an advertising spend of Pounds 13m, according to Nielsen research data,
Andrex sold Pounds 193m in 1992, moving ahead of Nestle's coffee brand,
Nescafe (Pounds 177.8m). Only Unilever's soap powder, Persil (Pounds
237.2m), Coca-Cola (Pounds 237m) and Procter &amp; Gamble's soap powder, Ariel
(Pounds 224.4m), did better.
On other score sheets Andrex's showing is even more impressive; according to
the trade magazine Marketing, its Pounds 5.7m television advertising
campaign achieved a higher prompted recall than any other brand, leaving the
much-hyped Nescafe Gold Blend advertising, featuring the drawn-out saga of a
couple whose on-off relationship is conducted over coffee beans, in only
fifth place.
The fast-food chain McDonald's spent almost three times that sum on its
television advertising in 1992, but languished 19 places behind Andrex in
Marketing's prompted recall chart.
Andrex's up-market strategy was evident from its first campaign, with press
advertising which subtly probed the consumer psyche: 'You buy powder and
good soap, of course, but are they everything? What do you use in your
toilet? Is it as safe and as pure as it should be? Are you paying enough for
it?'
Customers probably were; at the time of its launch Andrex was sold only in
Harrods. In the meantime Andrex, now owned by Scott Paper, has become a
classic example of a brand which has successfully managed to charge
substantially more - a price premium of up to 40 per cent above the market
average - and yet dominate on what should be a thoroughly commoditised and
price-only battlefield.
Andrex currently has about 34 per cent (by value) of the UK toilet tissue
market, the next major brand being Kleenex, owned by Kimberly-Clark, with
12.6 per cent (ranked 26 in Nielsen's top 100 brands). The questions now are
how far it can sustain its position in the UK - especially given the rise of
own-label brands right across the spectrum of consumer products - and how
far Scott can penetrate the continental European market. Kleenex, for one,
is investing Dollars 200m in what is claimed to be Europe's biggest toilet
tissue mill, in France, aiming at taking the European toilet tissue market
by storm this decade.
It took a step in that direction one year ago, by introducing common
European packaging for the entire Kleenex toilet tissue range.
In the UK, though, Andrex faces its major marketing battle not against
Kleenex but against own-label products, with a 39.7 per cent market share,
again by value. In volume terms own-label products have a 41.2 per cent
share, against Andrex's 29.2 per cent and Kleenex's 11.6 per cent. Premium
price toilet tissue accounts for 61.6 per cent of the UK market, giving
Andrex, a premium product, plenty of scope for eating into the own-label
threat.
Andrex is a UK-only brand so far; Scott markets toilet tissue under other
brand names, Scottex and Cotonell, in the rest of Europe. But Scott intends
following up the astonishing popularity of its UK television advertising
campaign - featuring a Labrador puppy which entangles itself in toilet
tissue - by extending the same campaign into the rest of Europe.
The puppy has been with Andrex since 1972 and, like many successful
advertising images, was a matter of chance. Andrex's advertising agency, J
Walter Thompson, had originally thought of using a little girl to muddle up
a toilet roll; but the Independent Television Commission, the UK body which
monitors television advertising, ruled against the idea on the grounds that
it might be seen as encouraging children to waste paper.
JWT has been Andrex's advertising agency since 1956, which itself is
something of an achievement given that client-agency relationships tend to
be stormy affairs. The puppy was thus substituted, with the idea of
demonstrating what Andrex claims as its key attributes - softness, length
and strength.
At least one own-label premium toilet tissue in the UK - Tesco's - has
thought Andrex's original slogan - 'soft, long and strong' - good enough to
be worth adopting on its own product.
At the end of January this year JWT Europe got the go-ahead from Scott to
set the puppy running across west Europe's TV screens. It is now being used
in Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy and Germany. Andrex's marketing manager,
Paul Duncanson, is fond of the puppy: 'I cannot overestimate the
contribution that little animal has made.'
He has every reason to be proud; since the puppy first appeared, Andrex's
volume share of the UK toilet tissue market has risen from 5 per cent to its
current dominance.
But Scott faces a tricky problem in its effort to repeat across Europe its
UK branding success with Andrex. In France, for example, the biggest brand,
Lotus, has a volume share of less than 16 per cent and sells at a price
premium of only 19 per cent above the market average.
In Germany - the largest European toilet tissue market accounting for about
a quarter of EC volumes - the biggest brand is Bess, with a national volume
share of only 11 per cent. But the own-label sector has 67 per cent of the
market, and has recently witnessed a price war. Scott and JWT will be hoping
that their old dog will be able to come up with a few new tricks to please
potential continental customers.

FT  11 FEB 93 / People: Sir Hal leaves the driving seat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ex-Tory MP Sir Hal Miller is to leave his job as chief executive of the
Society of Motor Manufacturers when his contract expires at the end of
March.
The extrovert 64-year-old former member for Bromsgrove and Redditch, brought
in by the SMMT to give a higher profile to the manufacturers' body as its
first full-time chief executive, has held the post only since November 1991.
He is to take up an as-yet unidentified 'senior position' in the textiles
industry.
His departure, announced yesterday, came as a surprise to many in the
industry, who had expected him to renew his contract for a further year. Sir
Hal was believed to have wanted to oversee preparations for the 1994 motor
show, which is potentially the last to be held at Birmingham.
A review of the show's frequency and location could see it moving to Earls
Court in London and becoming an annual affair from 1996.
Otherwise, despite the recession in the UK motor industry, he will be
leaving with at least one feather in his cap: during his 16 months in office
he is widely credited with having played possibly the lead role in
persuading the government to abandon the 10 per cent Special Car Tax which
had been the industry's bete noir for two decades.
There are, as yet, no declared favourites to succeed him, though one
candidate must be fellow former MP Roger King, whom Sir Hal drafted in as
the SMMT's head of external affairs shortly after his own arrival.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Accountancy Column: Poacher turned gamekeeper has
accountants in his sights - Andrew Jack explains the little-known background
to Michael Heseltine's attack on 'wealth managers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WELCOMING sight lies just a few pages inside the front cover of the
freshly-printed 1993 members' directory of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales. It is a smiling photograph of Mr Ian
Plaistowe, this year's president.
But if Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK secretary of state for trade and
industry, were to turn to the previous page, he would be unlikely to share
that facial expression for long. Judging by a speech he gave last week, he
would probably substitute a gritty grimace for the grin.
The page proudly states that the institute counted 100,135 members on its
rolls by July 1 last year. The rest of the directory - all 1,500 pages of it
in microscopic print - is devoted to listing each of them and their firms.
By the end of last month, that figure had risen to 102,390. There was even a
formal presentation of an engraved paperknife to the lucky 100,000th member.
Mr Heseltine would no doubt have preferred to offer a mallet, or some other
more practical industrial object.
In a sombre address to the Scottish Division of the Institute of Directors
in Edinburgh last Friday, he criticised what he saw as Britain's imbalance
of 'wealth managers' to 'wealth creators', contributing to the lack of
innovation in business. Accountants and lawyers were high up his hit list.
While the route to the top of German and Japanese companies is through
engineering, science or research qualifications, in the UK it has been
through 'the City, Parliament and above all accountancy,' he said. 'I find
it hard to believe this offers us the best way ahead.'
Knocking comments about accountancy are nothing new. It may be one of the
world's younger professions, but it has long been the butt of jokes and
dismissive comments. Early last year, Mr Akio Morita, the chairman of Sony,
described as 'very curious' the fact that many UK companies are headed by
accountants rather than engineers. Some bruised beancounters have taken
particular satisfaction in seeing Sony's own financial position deteriorate
since that time.
But Mr Heseltine's prominence as head of the government department with
responsibility for British industry and for monitoring and regulating
accountants, means that his comments are worthy of attention - and given
even greater weight by the comparative silence on the subject by Mr Neil
Hamilton, his junior minister.
To be fair, his dismissive remarks were only part of a wide-ranging speech
on the need by companies to take a longer-term view. But the opinions
certainly struck a raw nerve in Mr Plaistowe, who wrote an indignant
response to the secretary of state on Monday in which he said he was
'surprised and disappointed'.
He accused the minister of falling into 'a notorious elephant trap' by
making comparisons with other countries, and asked him to address the issue
of why so many talented young graduates considered accounting such an
attractive career. 'We have a qualification which is highly prized,' he said
yesterday. 'People choose it because it gives them a wide range of options.'
Mr Heseltine's antagonism towards accountants is not new. In his book Where
there's a will published in 1987, he says auditors should ideally be
appointed by a body independent of a quoted company's board. He says
auditors should be banned from conducting non-audit work such as management
consulting for audit clients.
He also tells how he helped create the Audit Commission for local
government, rejecting the idea that an auditor could be independent when
appointed by the local authority on which it was reporting.
But his views have apparently hardened in the last few years. In 1990, he
was still reported as claiming in a speech that 'accountancy is not boring'
and that it provides 'wonderful training' as a preparation for business.
Sigmund Freud would no doubt have drawn considerable significance from Mr
Heseltine's early experiences as an accountant. Though strangely missing
from Who's Who and other biographical reference works, the minister began
his career as an articled clerk with Peat Marwick Mitchell, now part of KPMG
Peat Marwick, in the 1950s - but failed the final exams.
He did extremely well by the profession, founding the weekly journal
Accountancy Age through his publishing company Haymarket, and then selling
it at a healthy price. The relationship may have begun to sour in the 1980s,
when he launched another journal called Account, which folded within a
matter of months.
Whatever the reason, Mr Heseltine has a point. Both the absolute number of
accountants and their proportion of the population in the UK is very high.
Add the Scottish and Irish to the English and Welsh chartered accountants,
include the certified, public finance and management accountants, and the
total quickly tops 200,000.
As the table shows, these levels are substantially above those in Japan and
Germany. In between come a number of tax havens or countries with favourable
regimes for multinational companies, such as Luxembourg and Gibraltar. The
only countries with more accountants per capita than the UK are members of
the Commonwealth such as Australia and Canada.
Conclusions and trends are certainly very difficult to draw from these
figures. Some of the statistics are outdated, and others not entirely
reliable. The abilities, qualifications and range of functions carried out
by members of the different professional bodies varies widely between
countries. In Japan, they cease to be counted as accountants once they leave
public practice.
In the UK, by contrast, many of those with accountancy qualifications do not
work in public practice at all. More than half of chartered accountants work
in business and industry, and a significant proportion  - particularly of
the certifieds - work in other countries.
None the less, Mr Heseltine's argument is partly echoed by Mr Peter Davis,
chairman of the Board of Chartered Accountants in Business, and out-going
finance director of Sturge Holdings. 'Accountants are not generally good
wealth creators, initiators or risk takers,' he says. 'But Britain is still
producing its share of entrepreneurs, and accountants have an important
secondary role in business.'
Perhaps what the professional bodies should consider is a more radical
overhaul of their syllabi to make them more relevant to the majority of
recruits who move into business after qualifying. But Mr Plaistowe makes a
fair point when he says accountants can hardly be blamed for any failure of
other businesses to make sufficient investment to attract as many good
recruits.
Arguably, Mr Heseltine, wearing his hat as regulator of accountancy, should
be returning to the thoughts in his book six years ago about conflicts of
interest and the question of to whom auditors should report. As with the
number of accountants, these issues have only continued to grow in the
meantime.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Survival strategy - Political
Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are dark mutterings again on the Tory backbenches. It is not so much
panic, more a mood of resigned desperation. Each week, it seems, brings a
fresh crisis, each crisis a fresh U-turn.
The latest furore over Maastricht is symptomatic. Nothing new has happened.
It has been apparent for months that the eventual vote on Labour's amendment
to remove the British opt-out from the social chapter would create an unholy
alliance to threaten the government's slim majority.
Lord Tebbit, Mr John Smith and Mr Paddy Ashdown have added nothing to their
previously stated positions. The latter two insist that the treaty would
survive the amendment. Lord Tebbit and his faithful band of Euro-sceptics in
the House of Commons are in ironic agreement with the Foreign Office that
insertion of the social chapter would wreck the legislation.
The vote is at least four - and possibly as many as eight - weeks away. A
defeat would be a serious blow for Mr John Major. But it would be followed
by a vote of confidence. The prime minister would win. The amendment could
then be removed again at the bill's report stage.
That the issue has caught alight so far in advance of its denouement simply
underscores the brittle confidence of the government and its supporters.
When there is no immediate crisis in sight they go in search of one.
But it is not quite so hard to understand the deeper undercurrents of
anxiety among Tory MPs. The crumbling of confidence in the pound on
financial markets has provided an awkward reminder that sterling crises also
happen outside the exchange rate mechanism. Economic recovery seems as
elusive as ever. The chancellor is threatening to increase taxes.
Unemployment is heading above 3m. Friends in the City warn that inflation
might soon be a problem.
The backbenchers have no simple or coherent remedy of their own. His
intensive pre-Budget consultations have left Mr Norman Lamont's ears ringing
with confusion.
Some want immediate tax increases - via the extension of value added tax -
to halt the haemorrhaging in government finances. Others insist that any
significant rise in taxation eventually would send Mr Major the way of Mr
George Bush. The favoured compromise is the announcement in March of modest
tax increases to take effect in December.
In truth, the average Tory MP is as uncertain as the average cabinet
minister about how best to nurture sustained recovery. As Mr Lamont
discovered to his cost, in such febrile times even a cut in interest rates
can be mis-interpreted.
The reflex response of some has been to demand that Mr Major reshuffle his
ministerial team - as if a few new faces around the cabinet table would
somehow calm the markets and fill the high streets. No matter that the
ministerial tier below the cabinet is hardly brimming with talent.
Others have resorted to the traditional call for the government to sharpen
its presentation. Somehow a few more speeches, a few appearances on the
evening news programmes should persuade the nation - and its supporters -
that the government is not drifting on to the rocks.
Mr Major does have a strategy. It is straightforward and entirely rational.
But it is hardly one he can shout from the rooftops. The prime minister
intends that he and his government should survive the next six months.
The prevailing assumption in the cabinet is that until recovery is visible
and until the the party has stopped tearing itself apart over Europe, the
government should be content to avoid defeats at Westminster.
It will fudge, compromise and where necessary perform indelicate U-turns to
preserve its 21-seat majority in a fractious House of Commons. Radical
policies can wait until the government regains its grip.
Evidence of the strategy was provided by decision to defer closure of one of
the Royal Navy's dockyards. It will be apparent again when Mrs Virginia
Bottomley announces that her plans to rationalise London's hospitals will be
the subject of further prolonged consultation. It is clear in the
determination of senior ministers to avoid if at all possible the need for
new legislation to rescue the coal industry. It is infecting ministerial
deliberations on the future shape of the police force and on measures to
help the unemployed.
Senior ministers are acutely aware that the strategy carries a price. They
will be accused of fudge and mudge, of indecision and lack of direction. But
they will survive to see better days. To adapt a phrase from the playground:
sticks and stones may break my bones but headlines will never hurt me.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister denies juice hazard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday denied that it had put public health at risk by
allowing the continued sale of apple juice which contained high levels of a
chemical that can cause cancer and birth defects, John Willman writes.
The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that high levels of patulin, produced
by moulds on rotting apples, had been found in five out of 32 samples of
apple juice tested in March.
Mr Nicholas Soames, the food minister, told the Commons that the levels of
patulin discovered in the juice were not considered an 'immediate hazard to
health'.
The minister said a report would be published next month, but Mr Gavin
Strang, Labour agriculture spokesman, said the government should have
published the test results last year and 'removed all toxic juice from the
shelves'.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown accuses Tories of protecting
big business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow chancellor, yesterday charged the Conservative
government with failing to address abuses of power by the banks, privatised
utilities and the food and farm sector.
Accusing his Tory opponents of protecting the vested interests of big
business to which many have personal links, he said Labour would champion
consumers' efforts to fight overcharging and poor service.
His attack signalled the second stage in the opposition's effort to project
itself as the party of the citizen and as opposed to the influence of
entrenched interest groups. This was first outlined by Mr John Smith, the
Labour leader, in Bournemouth on Sunday.
Mr Brown used an open meeting of Labour's finance committee to highlight
alleged abuses of power and privilege by what he described as 'cartels and
cliques'. His chief targets were the high street banks which, he said, were
still charging 20 per cent above base rate on credit card accounts.
In addition, he said some 30 per cent of small businesses had not received
the full benefit of recent interest rate cuts. At the same time, bank
charges had risen by Pounds 2bn or 50 per cent during the recession while
dividends and boardroom salaries rose by 80 per cent and 60 per cent
respectively.
Calling for a new inquiry into banking practice, he said its terms should
examine the case for customer contracts, which would give legally
enforceable rights to advance warning of increases in charges.
Among a number of other proposals were the creation of a banks' ombudsman,
regularly published comparative tables on bank charges to encourage
competition and choice, a fresh look at how to promote long-term investment
and efforts to increase Europe-wide banking competition.
The shadow chancellor said: 'When people ask why, in the face of increased
criticism, the Conservatives will not act, they should remember that much of
the Tory party - in the Commons and Lords and even in the cabinet - comes
from the banks, is of the banks and may soon be on its way back to the
banks.'
Broadening his attack to the privatised utilities and the food industry, Mr
Brown went on to charge that electricity, gas, and telecommunications
charges in the UK were far above those of Japan, the US and Germany.
'The dark recesses of private power needed to be opened up to scrutiny with
rights of representation for the consumer,' he said. Citing a number of
former cabinet ministers now on the boards of privatised companies, he
added: 'The Conservatives will not act simply because they are too close to
the boardroom of the utilities.'

FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: 'Polecat' fails to rouse rage

<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   THE 'polecat adorned with ermine'
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a soubriquet he chose himself - was back. Lord Tebbit yesterday demonstrated
his flair for grabbing the headlines and shaping debate at Westminster.
'When I was translated to the peerage there must have been a good many in
high, or even low places muttering, 'well that's got him nailed up safely in
his political box',' he told the press gallery.
Not for the first time in his political life, Lord Tebbit was biting the
hand of the establishment that once fed him.
He may have been flattering himself unduly. Elsewhere at Westminster the
reaction was more condescending than outraged. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, did not rise to the bait, while a government whip sniffed: 'He
(Tebbit) is yesterday's man.'
The 61-year-old former Conservative party chairman, trade and industry
secretary and employment secretary has only a fraction of the influence he
once held. At his height he was one of the closest allies of Baroness
Thatcher, the former prime minister.
He was the epitome of a Thatcherite minister, a grammar-school boy who
worked his way to the top. His brash straight-talking fitted in a
conviction-driven government. He told the unemployed to get on their bikes
to look for work. He was ambitious, privately harbouring ambitions to be
Conservative leader. But he left the government mainly to look after his
wife who was badly injured when the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel in Brighton
during the 1983 Tory conference.
He did not, however, have a personal following in the Commons, and after
leaving office he earned disrespect for raising immigration as a political
issue. Now he risks devaluing his credibility with each ever-stronger
outburst.
His importance rests on the belief that he does, to some extent, speak the
mind of Baroness Thatcher, still a totem for the Tory right wing. He is a
master at rabble-rousing, successfully dividing last October's Conservative
conference with an electrifying speech on Europe in front of Mr John Major
and Mr Hurd. He is an embodiment, perhaps, of the darker side of many Tories
 -enunciating their fears about an encroaching European state - who can be
safely disowned in public.
Hence the lukewarm reaction of Euro-sceptic Tory MPs yesterday may not have
been surprising. 'We don't take our orders from Tebbit,' said one. 'We will
take our own decisions in our own time,' said Mr James Cran, a prominent
dissident.
Lord Tebbit may have damaged their tactics. One loyalist Tory said the
debate about Labour's amendment to the Maastricht treaty was peaking too
early. No vote is likely for at least a month, he said. It would be easier
now for constituency associations to be warned that their MP was backing the
social chapter.
But that may be too optimistic. Lord Tebbit's talent for self-resurrection
is not exhausted yet.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley pledge on benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S manifesto pledges to uprate child benefit and the basic
retirement pension in line with inflation for the lifetime of the present
parliament would not be affected by its recently announced long-term public
spending review, Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, told MPs last
night.
The government had 'no intention of reneging on' these promises, he said.
'Our manifesto was explicit: we believe the basic pension must remain the
foundation for retirement . . . likewise, we are committed to child
benefit.'
Mr Lilley also set the benefits agency and councils a combined target for
the year ahead of identifying and stopping Pounds 1bn of fraud across the
full range of benefits. It was, he said, 'essential to staunch the flow of
money to those whom parliament did not intend to receive it'.
Confirming that the government was uprating all main benefits in line with
inflation, the social security secretary said he had been 'mindful
particularly' of those hit by the recession.
Mr Lilley said two main principles underlaid the long-term review in the
context of social security, the government's biggest-spending department.
These were to focus improvements in benefits to those in greatest need and
to harness private provision wherever possible.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: High rents blamed for pub price
rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEER prices in pubs have risen 17 per cent in real terms since 1989 mainly
because of the higher rents and charges imposed on pub leaseholders by
national brewers, the Commons agriculture committee was told yesterday.
Though wholesale prices had moderated, consumers had so far gained little
benefit, Mr Stephen Cox, of the Campaign for Real Ale, said.
Many of the pub-owning companies that had been formed as the national
brewers were forced to dispose of a third of their pubs by the government's
reforms - known as the beer orders - had 'borrowed so heavily to buy pubs
that they are in no position to pass on brewery discounts to customers,' he
said.
Mr Ted Weakner, chairman of the London and South-East Licensed Victuallers
Association, said many tenants had been forced to accept uneconomic rents
and repair costs or quit their pubs.
Both Camra and the licensed victuallers told the committee that a review of
the effects of the beer orders should be carried out urgently. The
government has already indicated that any review will be left to the
European Commission in 1997.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister denies apple juice hazard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Government yesterday denied that it had put public health at risk by
allowing the continued sale of apple juice which contained high levels of a
chemical which can cause cancer and birth defects.
The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that high levels of patulin, produced
by moulds on rotting apples, had been found in five out of 32 samples of
apple juice tested in March.
Mr Nicholas Soames, the food minister, told the Commons that the levels of
patulin discovered in the juice were not considered an 'immediate hazard to
health'.
The findings had been referred to the official Committee on Toxicity, and a
report would be published next month, the minister said.
Answering an emergency question from the opposition, Mr Soames said that
agriculture ministry in accordance with the 'best scientific advice
available in the land'.
He said food safety standards in Britain were the highest in the world.
Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman (C Lancaster) demanded: 'Will you assure the
young woman who rang my constituency office this morning, and is expecting a
baby shortly, that she need have no fears for the baby or herself?'
Mr Soames replied: 'I am happy to give the absolute assurance that that is
the case.'
Mr Gavin Strang, Labour spokesman on agriculture, said the government had
not denied that patulin could cause cancer and other 'life-threatening'
conditions.
The government should have immediately published the test results last year
and 'removed all toxic apple juice from the shelves,' he said.
Their failure to do so underlined the need for an independent food standards
agency, he said.
But Mr Soames accused him of 'ridiculous and idiotic scare-mongering'.
Supermarket chains such as Sainsbury and Marks &amp; Spencer said yesterday that
they rigorously screened their apple juice for patulin.
However, the Consumers' Association said that the public should have been
told as soon as the high levels of patulin were discovered.
'The government's handling of the problem is the latest in a long line of
cover-ups by the government,' said Mr John Beishon, the association's
director.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Personal View: Absence of road pricing takes its toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES KEATING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Would the British electorate rather pay road tolls or medical bills?
Astonishingly, this basic question is not being asked in the government's
new review of public spending priorities, which covers only health,
education, social security and the Home Office.
Road tolls are being eased on to the political agenda, but as a separate
item promoted by the Transport Department. Yet the provision of roads is as
much part of the welfare state as the provision of state pensions and
schools. And although public expenditure on roads is modest compared with
the health bill, the yield from tolls could easily be more than Pounds 10bn.
There could be even a bigger effect on the public sector borrowing
requirement if roads were privatised. The German government has recognised
the benefit of such a move, having just approved plans to privatise its
autobahns and impose an annual fee.
Resource allocation on Britain's road system is one of the last outposts of
Soviet-style economics. Road usage in big cities and on many inter-city
routes is limited by queueing rather than pricing, as used to happen in
Moscow's food stores. No attempt is made to charge for factors such as
vehicle emissions, congestion or accidents, echoing the practice applied to
East Germany's chemicals plants.
There is a strong economic case for sweeping all this away and replacing it
with electronic road pricing, especially in urban areas, with premium rates
for the rush hour and discounts after midnight. For users concerned that the
system might allow their movements to be tracked, technology exists for them
to be charged anonymously.
By contrast, the market for healthcare is bedevilled with information
problems, as US medical services demonstrate. Doctors know much more than
their patients, which allows them to charge for unnecessary tasks. The
threat of negligence suits helps to institutionalise this over-provision.
Private health insurance suffers from market failure owing to 'too much
information': there can be no insurance for chronic conditions where it is
known that treatment has to be provided, nor can hereditary conditions be
covered.
Recent studies of road pricing do not give figures of probable revenues, so
we have made tentative estimates. We reckon the annual toll revenues at
Pounds 11.5bn, assuming a rate of 3p a kilometre for cars on motorways and
trunk roads, close to the French level, and 8p in towns. This also assumes
that tolls cut traffic volumes by one-fifth. Experience of tolls on UK river
crossings and Continental motorways suggests that a substantial net income
would remain after collection charges. Moreover, the flotation value of the
railway companies should be increased.
If the entire road network were privatised, the private sector would raise
the capital to develop and install the toll collection systems and to fund
the existing road building programme. The flotation value would be very
roughly Pounds 75bn, at a price/earnings ratio of 12, neglecting tax, if
annual collection costs were 10 per cent of revenues, and if creation of the
toll systems cost one year's revenue. The German government estimates that
its autobahn network is worth DM120bn-DM130bn (more than Pounds 50bn).
The effect on the PSBR would be significant. If these proceeds were spread
over five years, the PSBR would be cut by Pounds 18bn initially (Pounds 15bn
from the flotation, plus Pounds 3bn saving on road expenditure), and by more
as the savings on debt interest built up. After five years, there would
still be an annual saving of some Pounds 9.5bn (Pounds 6.5bn from lower
interest payments, plus the Pounds 3bn). The exact figures would of course
depend on many items, including the treatment of local authority spending
and on whether the road fund licence was retained.
This privatisation would create a series of companies with good potential to
develop new technologies and services for sale on domestic and international
markets. At home, they could sell real-time traffic information systems to
drivers and, eventually, road guidance systems to take over control of
vehicles on the motorways. Abroad, they could sell their expertise in
electronic toll collection and guidance systems into what looks set to be a
rapidly developing market.
Road pricing offers a way of slashing the PSBR, while reducing congestion
and pollution, and creating the base for a world-class high-technology
industry in the UK. The economic arguments in its favour seem almost
overwhelming compared with those for charges in other areas of the welfare
state. Yet it is not even on the agenda. Something is wrong.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Leading Article: From conflict to co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACQUES Delors told the European Parliament yesterday that 'the very idea
of a united Europe is in peril'. He was right. The European Community's
economic malaise is undermining its political credibility. Many belabour the
UK for 'competitive devaluation', or 'Anglo-Saxon circles' for undermining
chances of economic and monetary union. This search for scapegoats is more
than a pity; it is a mistake.
Mr Delors rightly argues for a co-operative solution to Europe's economic
problems. The difficulty has been that sensible co-operative solutions have
not been on offer. On the contrary, those co-operative solutions that have
been offered - the European Monetary System, as it operated between German
unification and September of last year, for example - have made things
worse, a possibility Mr Delors does not recognise.
Nothing can be less appealing than defending the policies of the present
government of the UK. Even so, it cannot be credibly criticised for
whimsical resort to beggar-my-neighbour policies, as some do, however
upsetting to other EC member states has been the manner of their
implementation.
UK gross domestic product contracted by more than 4 per cent between the
second quarter of 1990 and the third quarter of last year. The UK also ran a
trade deficit with the rest of the European Community of Ecu8.5bn (Pounds
6.3bn) in 1992, larger than that of any other EC member country, bar Spain,
while, its overall current account deficit was Pounds 11.8bn (2 per cent of
GDP). Against so grim a background, even a devaluation of 16 per cent cannot
be viewed as predatory, whether or not it turns out to be a 'dead end', as
the French prime minister has argued. No country can owe either exchange
rate overvaluation or never-ending recession to its trading partners.
Sterling was forced out of the ERM because its parity proved incompatible
with economic recovery. It is for the same reason that the much-condemned
speculators have doubted other parities within the system. What made these
parities inconsistent with tolerable economic performance was German
economic policy, on the one hand, and the determination to eschew a degree
of exchange rate flexibility, on the other. It is peculiar, therefore, for
leading figures in German politics, largely responsible for the former, and
leading figures in French politics, principally responsible for the latter,
to blame the consequences of those decisions on speculators, 'Anglo-Saxons',
and other bugbears.
The EC must deal with the underlying causes of its malaise. The Bundesbank,
for example, is not so much a cause, more a victim of events. The most
important cause was the refusal to allow the ERM to operate flexibly after
German unification. The outcome has been a vicious circle of economic
deterioration and political conflict. The co-operation for which Mr Delors
rightly calls needs to start here. All else is secondary.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Observer: Van hopes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wheels within wheels. Motor-industry watchers goggled at the speedy
departure from DAF of Sandy Mathieson to return to his former British
Leyland haunts with Rover. Could this herald a Rover-led rescue of Leyland
DAF's Birmingham van plant?
For one thing, Mathieson was in the front seat beside current Rover chairman
George Simpson while he was turning round British Leyland's van business
before the merger with DAF in 1987.
For another, the man who then took over the controls - Graham Morris - is
also back with Simpson overseeing European marketing operations. And, for
good measure, the faltering van plant supplies the key body components for
Land Rovers and Range Rovers to boot.
Alas, hopes that Simpson and Morris had pulled in Mathieson for a mercy dash
appear to be mere wishful thinking. It's said he'd decided to make his move
well before DAF ran out of road.

The City of London establishment should surely shiver at the sight of Morgan
Stanley International, the London end of the pushy Wall Street broker,
sharing the underwriting of the Commercial Union rights issue with Kleinwort
Benson.
It's one thing for firms like Morgan Stanley to earn a crust by brokering
clever deals to UK corporate clients. But the CU deal was a bog-standard
rights issue which Kleinwort, CU's traditional adviser, would have dearly
loved to have done on its own and collected the full fee.
Presumably Morgan Stanley's name has been added as a reward for past favours
to CU. It certainly belies the accusation that US investment banks are only
interested in doing deals and not prepared to invest in long-term
relationships with their clients.

Before Britain loses Storehouse's David Dworkin to a new life in California,
Observer thinks readers should know the secrets of the BhS and Mothercare
group chief executive's diet. After all, even though by no means porky on
reaching BhS from America in late 1989, he has since personally shed as much
further excess fat as he took out of the business.
His intake is apparently based on regular helpings of carbohydrate.
Favourite lunch is a jacket potato followed by yoghurt, but he denies
wandering around the head office eating a bowl of Rice Krispies. Whenever
his blood sugar is a little low he unzips a banana.
Another ingredient, which may account for the breath of fresh air he has
brought to Storehouse, is plenty of exercise. But since he sometimes takes
it to the extent of working in cycling shorts, he may well be better suited
to life on the west coast.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amid all the fuss about what's to happen to British Rail's
multi-billion-pound pension fund, one little detail seems to have been
missed. Who gets the art collection?
British Rail's decision to invest Pounds 40m of its workers' pension monies
in works of art in the 1970s has proved to be one of its more imaginative
business decisions. Helped by Sotheby's, BR bought 2,200 high-quality
objects from Old Masters and Impressionists to Chinese antiquities.
Luckily it got rid of most of them before the art bubble burst in 1989, and
reckons to have earned an annual return after inflation of 6 per cent on its
investment.
With the Impressionists, including important works by Renoir and Monet, it
did much better. Having put in Pounds 3.4m, it recouped 10 times as much
just before that particular segment of the market's technicolour collapse.
Only around 350 objects remain in the collection but they include some of
the finest canvases, particularly of the Old Master kind. There is a
striking Van Dyck of the Little Princesses, on loan to the National Gallery
of Scotland, and a Goya Bullfight currently thrilling aficionados in the
Fitzwilliam. A similar Goya sold in December for almost Pounds 5m.
Somehow Observer suspects that, if the remnants of the collection pass into
the Treasury's hands, they will either be off-loaded at just the wrong
moment or stuck in some anonymous warehouse. Perhaps the pension fund
trustees should strike first, and hand what's left to the railway museum at
York.

FT  11 FEB 93 / A meeting of suspicious minds: The tensions surrounding
today's EC-US trade talks in Washington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An air of apprehension hangs over today's trade talks in Washington between
the European Community and the US, the first high-level meeting between the
two partners since President Bill Clinton took office last month.
On both sides, there is nervousness about how Sir Leon Brittan, the
intellectual EC external trade commissioner, will cope with Mr Mickey
Kantor, the new US trade representative and a shrewd deal-maker whose
strongest card is that he has President Clinton's ear.
The need to establish personal chemistry is important because EC-US
relations face a rough passage, at least in the short term. In the first
three weeks of the new US administration the EC has had to digest statements
and actions in Washington which, though some were not initiated by the
Clinton government, have heightened the already sharp European fears of
trade conflict with the US.
They include:
A US Commerce Department decision to impose stiff anti-dumping duties on
carbon steel products from 19 countries, including some EC members. A US
threat to freeze out EC companies bidding for millions of dollars worth of
US government contracts, because of objections to a EC utilities directive.
Potentially more damaging is the hint that the US might withdraw from the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's multinational government
procurement code.
The new administration's resistance to extending the fast-track negotiating
authority beyond its expiration date on May 31. An extension of the fast
track, under which the president offers completed trade agreements for
congressional ratification without the opportunity for amendment by the
legislature, probably offers the best prospect of wrapping up the
six-year-old Uruguay Round of the Gatt world trade talks. There is some
cause for optimism. Earlier this week the Canadian trade minister was
advised in Washington that an extension would be sought.
Sir Leon denounced the steel and procurement decisions as 'unilateral
bullying'. He has also been frustrated by the administration's 'go-slow'
tactics on the Gatt. Without an agreement, he believes, a faltering world
economy risks missing out on an expansion of trade of between Dollars 100bn
and Dollars 200bn. Failure to reach a Gatt deal would further weaken an
already-strained framework for resolving trade disputes.
EC apprehension stems partly from the change of power in Washington.
President Bush was a known quantity, rarely allowing trade to dominate
relations with Europe. He was adept at using threats of protection by
Congress as a foil, warning allies that he represented the best deal on
offer.
President Clinton is an unknown quantity. His big theme is change; but his
relations with Congress are untested. His obvious focus is domestic, or as
Mr Kantor put it in his confirmation hearings: 'Trade policy is to be part
of a co-ordinated and integrated economic strategy.'
Some EC trade officials worry that this implies the entry of new players in
Washington into the field of trade policy previously the preserve of a
handful of politically insulated 'experts', such as Mrs Carla Hills, Mr
Bush's trade representative. Particular concern centres not only on Congress
but also on the writings of Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the Council
of Economic Advisers and an advocate of 'reciprocity' in trade, and perhaps
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary and architect of tough 1988 trade
legislation. Some hope that the discreet Mr Robert Rubin, running Mr
Clinton's economic security panel in the White House, could be a
counterbalance.
This uncertainty explains why Sir Leon made a serious effort to reach an
outline agreement on the Uruguay Round with the outgoing Republican
administration.
On January 2, four days before he formally took over his post, Sir Leon
spent all day closeted with Mrs Hills. He offered sharp cuts in tariffs,
prompting US officials to believe a large market-access package could be
completed before the inauguration. What happened next is in dispute. EC and
US officials in Brussels say the outgoing administration failed to respond
with a serious counter-offer. In Washington, US officials say Sir Leon
subsequently backtracked because of division within EC.
Sir Leon now faces a fresh US team. It is an administration which, on the
fragmentary evidence of its first three weeks, with so many policies at home
and abroad subject to review and with so many senior positions still
unfilled, is not about to be rushed. Nor is Mr Kantor, a man patient and
clever enough to have faced down the ultimate negotiator, Mr James Baker,
when the two determined the framework of last year's presidential debates.
The key will be Mr Clinton himself. Those who know him well, like Ms Paula
Stern, former head of the International Trade Commission, an independent
regulatory body, are convinced that philosophically he is a free trader,
which was indeed the balance of the evidence of last year's campaign. She
insists Mr Clinton understands better than did Mr Bush that 'America's
prospects are tied up with global prosperity'.
In spite of the EC's fears about resurgent US protectionism, Mr Clinton's
words on trade as president have so far been carefully measured. He
certainly did not encourage the US auto industry's pursuit of anti-dumping
remedies and this lack of support was probably a factor behind Detroit's
decision on Tuesday not to proceed as threatened. Nor can new protectionist
impulses necessarily be read into the steel tariffs ruling, imposed in the
first week of the new government but long in train.
Still, the US 'wait-and-see' approach to the Gatt is not without risk, not
least because it could exacerbate several bilateral disputes already in the
pipeline. The dispute over state support for Airbus Industrie, the European
aircraft builder, may have temporarily been settled. But the EC remains
angry over US taxes on European luxury cars, while the US-EC accord on
agricultural export subsidies reached late last year, supposedly clearing
the way for a Gatt deal, is still fragile. Above all, the steel and
procurement rows, both of which Sir Leon and Mr Kantor must address today,
underline the dangers of conflict.
What irks Brussels is that the US steel duties include a 10-year period in
the 1980s when the EC was operating under a global 'voluntary' restraint
agreement with the US. The US action looks like a breach of faith, but it
also represents an abuse of the wide-ranging US anti-dumping law to protect
a cossetted industry, says an EC official.
The dispute over the EC utilities directive is murkier. It allows EC
governments to reject tenders where the non-EC content is more than 50 per
cent. Also, preference is given to tenders where more than half the contents
are EC-produced, even if the price is up to 3 per cent higher. Mr Kantor
claims the directive blocks US access to government contracts; but EC
officials see it as an important market-opening initiative and a centrepiece
of the single market programme, allowing outside bidders to enter a business
worth about Ecu50bn (Pounds 40.6bn) in telecoms and electrical equipment
alone.
One potential compromise is to drop temporarily the 3 per cent clause in
return for reciprocal concessions under the US Buy America Act, a federal
law which encourages domestic procurement. But the bilateral disputes cannot
conceal the main task in front of Mr Kantor and Sir Leon. This is to
establish a road map for a future Gatt agreement which includes tackling
specific areas of dispute and a commitment to an early deal.
Without such a commitment, says Mr Gijs de Vries, a Dutch Euro MP and close
observer of US-EC relations, trade tensions will come to dominate the
transatlantic alliance, putting at risk necessary co-operation in other
areas such as bringing peace to the former Yugoslavia and helping reform in
the former Soviet Union. The Clinton administration would not dissent from
this view. But defusing trade disputes will not be easy in the current
climate of suspicion on both sides.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Act on Cambodia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE THE signing in October 1991 of Cambodia's peace agreement, most of the
370,000 refugees in border camps have safely returned home, and 4.7m people
have registered to vote in May's elections. Those are the positive
achievements of the 22,000-strong United Nations presence. The failures,
however, are mounting.
The UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, Untac, which was charged with
supervising, monitoring and verifying the ceasefire, has instead watched war
continuing. Rather than being disarmed and cantoned by Untac, factional
forces have intensified their fighting. The Khmer Rouge, though it committed
itself to the agreement, is not participating in elections and has
perpetrated numerous ceasefire violations including attacks on UN personnel.
It controls at most 20 per cent of Cambodia's territory and probably a far
smaller proportion of the population. But violence is spreading. Government
forces last week attacked Khmer Rouge positions in flagrant violation of the
ceasefire.
Ceasefire and disarming of troops were to be the building blocks of the free
and fair elections which the UN was to supervise. Though they have not been
achieved, the country is nevertheless proceeding to elections.
Cambodians, especially the Khmer Rouge, are responsible for the
deterioration. However, Untac's authority has been undermined by inability,
under its peacekeeping mandate, to react strongly to ceasefire violations.
It has not acted quickly or firmly enough to correct the situation.
It is no longer enough for Untac to hang on grimly and hope for the best.
The danger of pushing ahead with elections without implementing other parts
of the plan has been all too painfully demonstrated in Angola. If the
Cambodian peace process is to be put back on track sufficiently for
elections to produce a constitution and a government which can be recognised
internationally, the UN needs to take action.
The options are not easy. It would probably not be possible to win support
for a substantial change in Untac's mandate. What is needed is a substantial
effort to win observance of the original peace agreement, even if that means
postponement of elections.
China needs to exert leverage on the Khmer Rouge - so far it has avoided
overt moves to distance itself. France, seeking to re-exert its influence
through President Mitterrand's visit today, has mischievously promoted the
holding of presidential elections before a constitution is drawn up. The
permanent members of the UN Security Council, as well as Japan which is
primarily financing the operation, must face up to the problem and act to
correct it. If the country descends again into civil war, the years of
effort put into obtaining a peace agreement, and the Dollars 2bn allocated
to the UN force, will be wasted - not to mention the lives of yet more
Cambodians.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Banks suggest register to stop excessive lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK DE JACQUELOT and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERSEAS banks based in London have suggested to UK banks that a joint
register of corporate loans should be compiled to stop lending to companies
that have excessive debts.
The Foreign Banks and Securities Houses Association has sent a detailed
proposal to the Bank of England and the British Bankers Association. It
hints that overseas banks would reduce their commitment to operating in the
City of London if a register was not created.
Many of them made big losses on loans to the late Robert Maxwell's group of
companies and to other concerns such as Brent Walker, the property and
leisure group. They believe this may not have happened if it had been easier
to ascertain the companies' overall indebtedness.
The banks had originally wanted the Bank of England to maintain the
register. The task is done in most continental European countries by their
central banks.
The Bank of England is reluctant to take it on. It believes a register would
at best provide only limited information on most companies' indebtedness
because the UK economy is so open.
The scheme proposed would involve voluntary bank participation and the
register would be run by a specially created company, owned by banks and
other financial institutions. Confidentiality would be guaranteed regarding
sensitive information.
The start-up costs are estimated to be about Pounds 10m and the running
costs, including 11 to 15 staff, in the range of Pounds 1m to Pounds 4m a
year.
The scheme would cover only the 1,500 biggest British companies and their UK
subsidiaries. Participating banks would report their loans to these
companies each month. The banks' proposal stresses that British companies
benefit greatly from the presence in London of about 470 foreign banks. But
the confidence of these banks has been eroded and needs to be restored if
they are to continue to lend to British companies.
To be effective the register would need to gather information not only from
banks but also from other providers of loans, such as leasing and factoring
companies, insurance companies and finance houses.
The foreign banks accept that getting agreement from all these institutions
would be very difficult.
The British Bankers' Association is due to circulate the proposal to its
members.

M and S said it had planned to take just 130 graduates in September 1993,
but would now recruit 190 including 'a handful from the Continent'.
The company added: 'Training takes a year to 18 months. We look at it as a
sign of confidence of what our position will be in 1995.'
M and S wants to increase its visibility in the European recruitment market.
'We believe competition will increase when the recession ends and we will
need to source the best candidates Europe-wide,' it said.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Church launches corporate video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHURCH of England, which has a Pounds 500m annual budget and 11,000
clergy, is bringing itself into line with other organisations of its size by
releasing a corporate video.
'Yours faithfully, the Church of England' was launched yesterday to depict
in 28 minutes some of the range and variety of the Church's activities.
It shows Dr George Carey's enthronement as archbishop of Canterbury; the
work of industrial chaplains on Tyneside; Dr John Habgood, archbishop of
York, speaking on the asylum bill in the House of Lords, and November's
general synod vote in favour of women priests.
The Rev Eric Shegog, the Church's director of communications, said the
Christian church had always employed the latest forms of communication as
they evolved. 'We started with illustrated manuscripts, went into
stained-glass windows and when Caxton came along we jumped on that
bandwagon.'
Although initially available only on subscription, the Pounds 10 video will
eventually be for retail sale. It was made by Boxclever Productions, whose
other clients include British Aerospace, at a cost of Pounds 30,000.
In true corporate tradition, the video ends with a message from the
archbishop of Canterbury suggesting the customer might care to sample the
product. Dr Carey says: 'Whatever a person is looking for, you are bound to
find it in the Church of England.'

FT  11 FEB 93 / Feltrim Names seek early ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the Feltrim syndicates at Lloyd's who are seeking compensation
for more than Pounds 600m in insurance losses have applied for a summary
judgment in their legal action against more than 50 agents at the London
insurance market.
The action is being taken by the Feltrim Names Association, formed by 1,500
Names - individuals whose wealth backs the market - who were members of
Feltrim syndicates 540 and 847. They allege that negligence by agents was
responsible for losses which could reach Pounds 600m.
A summary judgment seeks to speed up court processes where the plaintiffs
believe they can present a case to which there is no arguable defence.
Through the normal process the case could take up to 18 months to reach
court.
Separately, 200 Names are pressing regulators to intervene over the rising
cost of administering claims against syndicate 126 which stopped
underwriting 10 years ago.
About 3,000 Names originally joined syndicate 126 attracted by the record of
its underwriter, Mr Ian Posgate. Losses on the 1982 year are about Pounds
40m - 154 per cent of the syndicate's original allowable premium income of
Pounds 26.9m.
Alexander Syndicate Management, a company specialising in run-off - managing
the business of a syndicate which is no longer active - has been
administering the syndicate's affairs. It has subcontracted claims-handling
to AJ Archer, the listed agency group.
Mr Chris Burton, a director of AJ Archer and secretary to ASM, said
yesterday that fees charged by Archer to ASM contained 'no profit element'.

FT  11 FEB 93 / For CDs even the bad times are good: With computer games
competing, companies are sticking to old artists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOB DYLAN was back in London this week, singing his old reliable hits such
as Maggie's Farm, Mr Tambourine Man and Don't Think Twice, It's All Right.
The critics complained that he seemed bored - if so, he was again capturing
the spirit of an age.
Last year the British music industry saw deliveries to record dealers drop
2.4 per cent to Pounds 692.5m - the first fall since 1980. In the most
difficult trading conditions that many in the music industry have seen,
companies have fallen back on old and trusted names.
Mr Simon Burke, managing director of the retail arm of the Virgin group,
says: 'There's been an undue emphasis on safe bets, like Cher, Madonna,
Michael Jackson. They're eminently bankable, but they're not new.'
Music manufacturers and retailers report that other successes have been
compilations of greatest hits by familiar names such as Pink Floyd, Cliff
Richard, Queen, Genesis and Simple Minds.
Industry executives say that although new names pop into the charts
frequently, few have a lasting impact. Mr Paul Conroy, managing director of
Virgin Records, which Mr Richard Branson sold to Thorn EMI last year, says:
'There have been a lot of one-off hit singles. But the artists don't go off
and develop acts. You look at the acts that there are and a lot of them are
old people.'
Mr Burke adds: 'The strength of creative output is not as great as in the
old eras of music, but these things go in cycles. During the 1980s music had
a pretty good time, but you can't do that forever.'
The drop in sales has been particularly marked among the under 25s, usually
a mainstay of the music business. The recession and the absence of new hits
account only partly for the dearth of young buyers. Industry executives
point to the large number of alternative leisure pursuits available,
particularly computer games.
Mr Burke says that although music sales in Virgin stores will be higher this
year than last, it is the teenagers buying computer games who will really
lift the company's profits. 'There's a buzz around new computer game
releases that there used to be 10 years ago around new music releases,' he
says.
Mr Brian McLaughlin, UK managing director of HMV, the music retailing arm of
Thorn EMI, says sales have been better in the 25-40 age group. 'They're
becoming a more important part of our business. They're more interested in
music than they've ever been.'
The compilations of old hits have sold particularly well to this group. Many
were previously vinyl record buyers who are now building up compact disc
collections.
A particular disappointment to the industry has been the failure of
classical music and opera to retain the sales momentum they built up in the
late 1980s and early 1990s. The success of Nigel Kennedy, the British
violinist, and the immense sales generated by the opera star Luciano
Pavarotti raised the hope that classical music had extended its appeal.
Mr Burke says: 'That burst of enthusiasm for classical music was a bit of a
flash in the pan. It was a trend based on a few artists and a few particular
works that people wanted.'
The industry hopes that the success of the Classic FM radio station will
regenerate interest in classical music. Some classical compositions are
still attracting buyers. A surprise success has been the Polish composer
Henryk Gorecki's third symphony.
Mr Rupert Perry, UK chief executive of EMI, says a music industry revival
may be some way off. If past experience is any guide, he says, the music
industry will recover a year after the rest of the economy.
He and many of his colleagues reject the recent accusation by Sir Malcolm
Field, managing director of WH Smith, that manufacturers have kept CD prices
too high and that they should cut them to stimulate sales. 'WH Smith's
results weren't good, so he's trying to point a finger,' says Mr Perry.
Mr McLaughlin says: 'It's always questionable that if you drop prices volume
will go up. We're not seeing any resistance to CD prices. CD sales are still
growing, even during a recession.'

FT  11 FEB 93 / British music market sees first decline since 1980
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK music market shrank last year for the first time since 1980 with
suppliers and distributors' revenues falling by 2.4 per cent to Pounds
692.5m, the British Phonographic Industry said yesterday, Michael Skapinker
writes.
Sales of compact discs continued to grow, however, and the number of CDs
sold last year exceeded sales of cassette tapes for the first time.
The BPI, which represents UK music companies, said sales of CD albums were
now greater than those of cassettes and long-playing records combined.
Deliveries of CD albums to record dealers totalled 70.5m units, an increase
of 12.2 per cent. That was a smaller rise than in 1991, when deliveries were
23.4 per cent higher than in 1990.
Consumer groups have criticised music manufacturers for charging too much
for CDs. Last month Sir Malcolm Field, group managing director of the WH
Smith retail chain, also called on manufacturers to reduce CD prices.
Manufacturers' claims that they have already reduced some CD prices appear
to be supported by the BPI figures. The wholesale value of CD albums
delivered to retailers was Pounds 380.5m, an increase of 10.1 per cent.
The remorseless decline of vinyl records continued last year, with unit
sales of LPs falling 48.3 per cent to 6.7m. That compares with 37.9m in
1989. The wholesale value of the LP market fell 48.6 per cent in 1992 to
Pounds 23.9m. Cassette deliveries to record dealers fell 15.5 per cent to
56.4m. Cassette wholesale values were down 13.4 per cent to Pounds 207m.
Deliveries of cassette singles rose by 29.8 per cent to 13.8m. However, they
were overtaken for the first time by CD singles, which grew 68.7 per cent to
16.4m. Seven-inch vinyl singles fell 41 per cent to 12.9m, and delivery of
12-inch vinyl singles dropped 30 per cent to 9.9m.

FT  11 FEB 93 / More than a third falter in further education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than a third of people aged 16 to 19 on full-time further education
courses in England and Wales do not complete their studies or attain the
intended qualifications, says a report published yesterday.
This implies that about Pounds 330m a year is spent on courses that confer
no qualifications on those taking them.
The report by the Audit Commission, the local government watchdog, and the
Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted), finds that non-completion rates
average 13 per cent for A-level courses and 18 per cent for vocational
courses. Similar proportions of enrolled students complete courses but fail
to gain qualifications.
Both these groups are included in the UK's over-16 education participation
rate, which at about 70 per cent last year is already among the lowest in
Europe.
The agencies recommend that funding should not encourage students
'indiscriminately' on to courses.
The report says: 'The intention of current reforms is that much more of the
impetus towards efficiency should be provided by the market freedoms which
institutions will have. But there is a potential danger of inefficiencies
arising from competition.'
It is also proposed that government league tables should include
non-completion rates and the relative value to students added by different
institutions.
Mr Andrew Foster, controller of the Audit Commission, said: 'It must be a
matter of concern for students, teachers and our economic future that so
many young adults do not complete or are unsuccessful in their courses. This
represents a waste of both resources and talent.'
The high levels of non-achievement and non-completion will strengthen the
case for reforms that bring the array of over-16 qualifications into a
single structure.
The government remains opposed to such reform, with strong pressure from the
Conservative party to maintain the so-called 'gold standard' of A-levels.
The report adds that the existing system of careers guidance for pupils in
their last year of compulsory schooling 'generally works well'.

SKILL shortages are at a much lower level than two years ago but still
exist, especially among small engineering companies, according to a
Department of Employment report.
Five per cent of large companies interviewed had hard-to-fill vacancies last
year compared with 22 per cent in 1990.
Other findings include:
In large establishments hard-to-fill vacancies were most often reported in
the distribution and consumer services sector.
Sixty per cent of companies felt that the level of skills needed by the
'average' employee were increasing.
Three quarters of large companies funded or arranged off-the-job training.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Patten to meet teachers' unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Patten, education secretary, agreed to meet the six teachers' unions
yesterday in an attempt to diffuse the controversy over this year's
compulsory English tests for 14-year-olds in England and Wales.
However, he ruled out any changes to the tests, and the agreement to meet
the NASUWT, the second largest teachers' union, is conditional on its
calling off a ballot on a boycott of all this year's tests.
Mr Patten said the tests 'must go ahead', claiming that they were 'vital' to
improving standards. He added: 'For too long, too many of our children have
left our schools without the ability to express themselves properly.'
He recognised, however, that taking account of the 'genuine concern' of
teachers had been 'critical in helping to iron out wrinkles in the system'
in the past.
Mr Peter Smith, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers, the leading moderate teachers' union, welcomed Mr Patten's
response. He said: 'Dialogue aimed at resolving a difference is better than
rhetoric which opens up a chasm. It is a sign that Mr Patten takes this
matter seriously.'
Teachers' unions claim that the English tests, to be taken for the first
time in June, have been inadequately prepared, and that material for them
arrived at schools too late.
Mr Patten said he would meet union leaders to 'discuss ways in which we can
build on the lessons that will be learnt this year in order to ensure the
successful rolling implementation of the national curriculum'.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Ofwat urges water companies to plug leaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFWAT, the water industry regulator, yesterday urged water companies to plug
leaks in mains and install more meters rather than build expensive new
reservoirs to meet growing demand for water.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said meters had been installed in
only 5 per cent of households. But he warned that some metered customers had
been charged too much. Ofwat says the steps being taken by water companies
to meet the growing new demand for water will account for a quarter of the
rise in water bills above the rate of inflation between 1990 and 1995.
Yesterday's report by Ofwat is the last in a series of consultation papers
leading up to next year's periodic review, at which the regulator will
reassess the basis for annual price rises for the first time since the 1989
privatisation. Wide differences between the companies and the regulator have
emerged on the question of how customers should pay for improvements.
Ms Janet Langdon, director of the Water Services Association - which
represents the 10 large water and sewerage companies - said yesterday: 'We
don't think it's yet clear that metering reduces demand - it is premature to
conclude that ahead of the results of trials by the Department of the
Environment and the companies.'
She added: 'We have a statutory duty to supply water, and if it suddenly ran
out there would be the most fantastic row.'
Mr David Luffrum, finance director of Thames Water - which is considering
building a large reservoir near Abingdon, Oxon - said: 'We believe in
metering where it makes sense and leakage reduction where it is
cost-effective, but we don't believe that on their own these will be
sufficient, and a reservoir may be needed.'
According to Ofwat, average water bills for metered households in some
regions were between Pounds 12 and Pounds 60 a year higher than for
unmetered households, and sewerage bills were between Pounds 8 and Pounds 73
higher.
Mr Alan Jones, finance director of Northumbrian Water, said: 'You can take
many different views on how to calculate these figures - they include
assumptions about how much water the average customer consumes which we are
discussing with Ofwat'. The regulator says Northumbrian has the biggest gap
between metered and unmetered charges.
Mr Byatt said the 'infrastructure charge' levied on new domestic customers
when they were connected to the system was 'too high' and varied between
companies to an extent which 'cannot be properly justified'. The report says
new properties in Eastbourne, East Sussex, pay Pounds 1,154 compared with
Pounds 394 in Hastings.

FT  11 FEB 93 / 1,600 Daf job losses 'imminent'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 1,600 jobs are expected to be cut at Leyland Daf, the UK subsidiary of
the beleaguered Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker, in a first round of
redundancies that will probably be announced tomorrow.
The UK workforce of Leyland Daf, which collapsed into administrative
receivership last week, totals about 5,500 with 2,200 in Leyland,
Lancashire, and 2,000 in Birmingham.
Union leaders who held talks with the receivers yesterday said last night
that they believed the first redundancies at the company's plants were
'imminent'. The receivers warned earlier this week that job losses were
'inevitable'.
Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, the joint administrative receivers,
warned yesterday that the refusal by a small number of component makers to
resume supplies to the UK Leyland Daf plants were jeopardising the
resumption of production.
'A handful are still refusing to supply,' said Mr McKillop. that was even
though all suppliers appointed since the company went into receivership
would be 'paid in full as an expense of the receivership'.
The failure of Leyland Daf had been 'an extremely serious problem' for many
suppliers, admitted Mr Talbot.
However, he called on suppliers 'to think very carefully about the
consequences of their actions'. He added: 'It is very important that
production at the Leyland Daf plants is maintained and the company's
manufacturing is stabilised'.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Acas workload jumps to record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACAS, the conciliation service, dealt with a record 72,166 unfair dismissal
and discrimination claims last year - almost 20 per cent more than in 1991.
The rising workload of the service, which has a statutory duty to conciliate
between employees and employers before a case goes to an industrial
tribunal, indicates the increased reliance of individuals and unions on the
law to resolve disputes.
It also reflects the continued rise in unemployment as individuals made
redundant claim that employers have failed to meet statutory or collectively
negotiated provisions governing redundancy procedures.
Sex discrimination claims rose 66 per cent to 5,778. Almost 40 per cent more
people brought claims that employers had failed to pay wages or benefits
laid down by wages councils under the Wages Act.
The number of people claiming racial discrimination rose almost 20 per cent
to 1,748.
Acas said 35 per cent of all claims were settled, 31 per cent were withdrawn
and 34 per cent were heard by an industrial tribunal.
Acas said the figures were consistent with the service's expectation. It
also said the increasing demand for conciliation meant diverting resources
from its advisory service.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Power chiefs reach accord on coal-fired electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGIONAL ELECTRICITY companies told the government yesterday that they had
resolved potential differences over coal-fired power which had threatened to
delay a solution to the pits crisis.
Company chiefs assured officials at the Department of Trade and Industry
that they have broadly agreed on the take-up of power generated by the coal
which the electricity generators have tentatively agreed to buy from April.
The move came as British Coal clashed with the National Union of Mineworkers
over the future of 10 collieries whose closure has been declared illegal by
the High Court.
Mr Mark Stephens, acting for the NUM, said he had started proceedings
yesterday against British Coal seeking an explanation why it had failed to
comply with a High Court ruling on consultation over the 10 pits. British
Coal said it would ask the High Court to confirm that it had complied with
the ruling.
The assurance to the DTI by 11 of the 12 regional companies is significant
because their agreement is essential to support the tentative agreement
between British Coal and the generators for the sale of 40m tonnes of coal
next year and 30m tonnes in each of the four subsequent years.
The regional companies are not yet prepared to sign agreements to take the
coal-fired power, but they have indicated that no significant problems
remain.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Exports 'aiding recovery': CBI finds regional rises in
foreign orders since sterling's devaluation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORT demand is shaping the regional pattern of economic recovery in
Britain, with industry in north-west England, Wales and Scotland reporting
increased foreign orders following sterling's devaluation after it left the
European exchange rate mechanism in September, says a survey published
yesterday.
The latest quarterly survey of regional trends from the Confederation of
British Industry and Business Strategies, an economic consultancy, found
that total manufacturing orders and output fell in all UK regions except
Wales in the four months to January.
But export orders rose in Wales, Scotland and north-west England between
last October and January, while manufacturers in the north-west and
south-west increased deliveries to foreign customers.
Manufacturers in all regions expect increased export orders in the first
four months of this year. On balance, industrialists in all regions expect
to deliver more goods abroad - except in the east Midlands where export
deliveries are expected to be unchanged.
The survey of 1,173 UK companies, which was carried out between December 21
and January 11, found increased optimism about the business situation and
export prospects over the next 12 months in all regions. Mr Charles Burton,
joint managing director of Business Strategies, said the fact that increased
optimism was so clearly linked to improved export prospects gave some hope
that the expected recovery would not be another false dawn.
According to Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's director of economic affairs,
business confidence improved most in south-west England, the west Midlands,
Wales and south-east England. The smallest rise in optimism was reported in
the east Midlands, northern England, Yorkshire and Humberside, East Anglia
and Northern Ireland.
The survey found that manufacturers in all regions expect increased orders
in the first four months of this year but output is expected to grow less
robustly as companies run down stocks. Companies in northern England
anticipate a sharp reduction in stocks over the coming months with the
result that output in that region is expected to continue falling.
Capital spending on plant and machinery is also expected to keep falling in
all regions except East Anglia, Wales and south-west England.
Mr Burton said that planned increases in investment might have been
triggered by the government's decision in the Autumn Statement to increase
capital allowances for a limited period.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Finance rules for public bodies may ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOOLS and hospitals could be allowed to borrow against their assets if
government plans for finding new ways of involving private finance in public
projects are implemented.
The Treasury believes that the health and education departments and the Home
Office are among areas with the most scope for the government's private
finance initiative to be extended.
All three departments are also in the first round of the longer-term public
spending review announced earlier this week, and so have a particular
incentive to find ways of stretching their budgets.
Extending the ability to borrow would build on the move announced in the
Autumn Statement, when the rule preventing universities from borrowing
against exchequer-funded assets was ended. The old universities have made
little use of the power so far, but many new universities - formerly
polytechnics - which have had a similar ability for a few years, have taken
more advantage of the change in the rules.
'We need to think whether the model applies elsewhere,' one minister said
yesterday. Proposals are unlikely to be far enough advanced for inclusion in
next month's Budget, but could be ready in time for the first unified Budget
and spending statement in December.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, is to use a
series of meetings with all Whitehall departments over the next few months
to discuss ideas for pressing ahead with the private finance initiative.
He will outline the government's plans to the cross-party Treasury committee
next week.
Private involvement in transport projects - where the cost can be passed on
to the user through charges - has seen the greatest advance in the
initiative so far.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, is to publish a consultation
paper after Easter on introducing tolls on motorways, and there is already
discussion of how the rules on funding for roads might be adapted to rail
projects.
Ministers believe that the private sector has a valuable role to play in
upgrading public-sector capital stock. Large sums could be at stake. While
there are no precise figures for capital spending on schools and hospitals
in 1992-93, capital investment in health, excluding trust hospitals, is
estimated at Pounds 1.43bn, and in education, by local government, at Pounds
1.08bn.
Giving the private sector a greater role would not necessarily mean that the
public sector would withdraw from providing capital in these spheres,
ministers say.
However, if private finance proved to be a better way of providing capital
for a particular type of asset, ministers believe, then the public spending
priorities would be bound to change.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Thames steps up pressure over Channel 5 licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES Television is expected to call next week for the early
re-advertisement of a national Channel 5 licence.
This follows the Independent Television Commission's formal rejection of a
plea to reconsider its decision in December not to award a licence to
Channel Five Holdings.
The main companies involved in that bid were Thames and Time Warner, the
world's largest media group. Channel Five Holdings wrote to the commission -
the commercial broadcasting regulatory body - on January 20 asking for its
case to be reconsidered. The appeal was rejected by the commission the
following day.
It is believed the appeal contested the commission's two grounds for
rejecting the bid from Channel Five Holdings: concern over investor
commitment and the channel's cost, audience share and revenue projections.
Thames was fully committed for 35 per cent and Time Warner for 10 per cent
plus an undertaking that a recommendation for a further 25 per cent would be
put before the main Time Warner board.
Last month Time Warner visited the commission and suggested that if there
was any sign of flexibility the money would be available from the US company
to fund the venture.
The commission's legal advice was that it could not reopen a final decision.
The commission made clear that even if it had the discretion to reopen the
decision it would choose not to.
It then decided to look at the possibility of using different frequencies to
run several local city-based television services.
The announcement, which surprised the National Heritage Department, would
require legislation. The next broadcasting legislation is not expected
before 1995.
Even if local stations got approval it is unlikely they could be set up
before 1997.
'This is not just kicking Channel 5 into touch, it's kicking it out of the
stadium,' one senior broadcasting executive said yesterday.
Channel Five Holdings continues to reserve its right to try to seek a
judicial review over the rejection of its bid.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOWER HAMLETS Council is moving its headquarters to a new building at East
India Dock in the London Docklands.
The council has signed a 10-year lease on the 140,000 sq ft building which
is jointly owned by NCC, a Swedish construction group, and Trygg-Hansa SPP,
Sweden's largest insurance and pensions group.
This is the first letting at the East India Dock development, which consists
of four buildings totalling 600,000 sq ft.
About 800 staff who work in eight buildings scattered around the borough
will move to the new headquarters in the summer. The council estimates that
the move will save it about Pounds 6m over the next 10 years.
The council said the move was linked to a structural reorganisation due in
April.
The East India Dock building will house the council chamber as well as its
engineering, finance, personnel and strategic services. Most of the other
services are now based in seven local centres.
Last summer the council shortlisted seven Docklands developments, including
Canary Wharf, for its new town hall.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Accountants scornful of Heseltine's 'wealth' jibe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS have resp-onded with anger to remarks by Mr Michael Heseltine,
the trade and industry secretary, that there are too many 'wealth managers'
and not enough 'wealth creators' in business.
In a letter to Mr Heseltine, Mr Ian Plaistowe, president of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said he was 'surprised and
disappointed' by the remarks - made to the Institute of Directors last
Friday.
Mr Plaistowe said Mr Heseltine had been 'badly briefed' on the accountancy
profession by his officials. He insisted that the profession was 'one of the
few sectors in which the UK is a world-beater in terms of quality and
breadth'.
He accused Mr Heseltine of falling into 'a notorious elephant trap' by
trying to compare the number of accountants in the UK with those overseas,
when the statistics measure profess-ions with very different functions.
Mr Plaistowe said accountants would not survive unless they were providing
skills and services that the market wanted.
He also argued that graduates applied for jobs with accountancy firms
because these organisations spent so much money on training, 'which puts
most of the rest of business to shame'.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Colin Powell says he may retire early: Top US general denies
rift over Clinton defence policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Colin Powell confirmed yesterday he was thinking of retiring early
as chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, but flatly denied this was
because of disagreements with the Clinton administration.
He appeared on morning television shows after a report in the New York Times
had quoted 'friends and associates' as saying he was unhappy with President
Bill Clinton's determination to admit homosexuals to the US military and
with the extent of the defence budget cuts under consideration.
Gen Powell's second two-year term as chairman of the joint chiefs is to
expire at the end of September.
He said yesterday that he had told Mr Dick Cheney, the previous secretary of
defence, last summer that he would not seek a third term, even if President
George Bush were re-elected last November. The general added that he had
spoken then of leaving the post a month or two early so as to resettle his
family.
He vigorously denied suggestions that he was at odds with the new
administration's policies: 'I'm not in any conflict with the administration
over their plans and I am not planning to retire early as a result of any
conflict.'
Gen Powell said the military had received 'good guidance' from Mr Clinton
and Mr Les Aspin, the new secretary of defence, with both of whom he had 'a
fine relationship'. He said he had every intention of testifying before
Congress in support of the new and reduced defence budget.
The general was also at pains to stress that the military at large was not
distressed by the new policies. 'There's nobody over here in a blue funk,
thinking the whole word has dropped on us,' he said. 'We shouldn't let the
impression be created around the country that somehow we are fighting the
president.'
He reiterated his 'concerns' about admitting gays to the military, but said
the president's guidance on the issue was clear and he was not about to be
'insubordinate' by frustrating it.
Gen Powell, 55 and black, is rated a phenomenally successful chairman of the
joint chiefs, and not only because of the victory in the Gulf war. His
doctrine of 'maximum force' has been criticised by some who feel that it
delayed US intervention in humanitarian crises such as that in Somalia, but
his reluctance to commit forces overseas without a clearly defined mission
commands much respect in Washington, where he is rated as a consummate
politician.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Poll 'won't overturn' Mexican austerity: Finance minister
assures Damian Fraser tight economic policies will stay despite 1994
election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S government will maintain its tight fiscal and monetary policy
throughout next year, and expects little increase in economic growth from
this year, according to Pedro Aspe, the finance minister.
The austere economic policy, if adhered to, would disappoint those in and
out of Mexico expecting a significant relaxation in the approach to the 1994
presidential election. The government intends to run a budget surplus of 1.7
per cent of gross domestic product this year and, through its commitment to
a stable exchange rate, has allowed one-year interest rates to rise to about
19.7 per cent - about ten percentage points more than projected year-on-year
inflation.
The tight economic policy slowed growth last year to an estimated 2.8 per
cent, far below the government's original aim, and has been widely
criticised for being too cautious. The commitment to maintain the tight
programme suggests the government has given up its target of reaching 6 per
cent growth by the end of the administration of President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari.
Mr Aspe said in an interview: 'We are going to stick to exactly the same
policy and (expect) growth this year of 3 per cent and next year - maybe a
little more but nothing spectacular.' Fiscal and monetary policy 'has been
exactly the same in 1989, 90, 91, 92, 93 - and it will be exactly the same
in 1994. We do not use stop-go policies.'
Mr Aspe remains committed to reduce inflation to single digits which, on an
annual basis, may happen as early as next month, and then to the levels of
Mexico's main trading partners. The central bank reported inflation of 1.3
per cent in January, which is by tradition a high-inflation month. This was
the lowest inflation for January since 1975.
The finance minister is not convinced a loosening of policy would help the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in the presidential election.
'People would notice immediately and say: 'Oh my God what are they doing? We
are going to have fun for six months and then a mess again.' You cannot fool
around with fiscal and monetary policy.'
The Mexican government freely admits economic growth in the short term
remains at the mercy of the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement,
whose swift passage through the US Congress depends on the Mexican and the
US administrations reaching prompt agreement on parallel accords on labour
and the environment.
If Nafta is passed in the US, capital flows into Mexico would almost
certainly increase, and interest rates could be lowered without endangering
the exchange rate target of a maximum rolling devaluation of 0.4 of a peso
per day (4.6 per cent a year). Indeed, the government is so convinced that
Nafta would sharply alter expectations of future growth in Mexico that it
has discussed ways to prevent excessive capital inflows fuelling inflation.
If Nafta is not passed - which the Mexican government considers highly
unlikely - the government may find it difficult to finance the growing
current account deficit, expected to be more than Dollars 20bn this year.
Government officials, however, are open to increasing the maximum rate at
which the peso is devalued, if that looks necessary. The government is not
considering a one-off devaluation.
The government is also prepared to accelerate economic reforms if Nafta is
not passed, in part to reassure financial markets. 'We will have to speed up
structural change' if Nafta is not passed, says one senior official. 'I
think we can convince people to respond in this way, rather than shoot
yourself in the foot (by reversing reforms).'
Political analysts have long speculated that rejection of Nafta would lead,
in Mexico, to a nationalist backlash and to pressure to slow or overturn
some of the present government's economic reforms. According to the
official, it would lead to a faster opening of the economy.

FT  11 FEB 93 / IMF demands consistency: Brazil told to present economic
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
has told Brazil it must present an economic programme before full-scale
negotiations can begin on a new accord.
The decision disappointed Mr Paulo Haddad, economy minister, who has been in
Washington this week for his first round of meetings with multilateral
financial institutions and members of the US administration.
The main aim of trip was to discuss with the IMF the targets for a new
accord in place of a Dollars 2.1bn stand-by, signed in January last year,
which collapsed after the initial payment because of Brazil's failure to
meet conditions.
Mr Rubens Pontes, the minister's chief of staff, said yesterday that the
meetings had gone well: 'We didn't expect a red carpet, given Brazil's poor
record of meeting IMF targets. But, in the circumstances, the reception was
almost warm and the fund is definitely disposed to collaborate.'
Mr Camdessus accepted Mr Haddad's request to use the last accord as a basis
for the new one, rather than negotiate from scratch. However, he insisted
that, so as to have numbers to work with, Brazil must put a consistent
economic programme in place before new targets could be set. Mr Pontes said
that the absence of a programme so far was a reflection of the new
government's 'more realistic stance. We are trying to clean the house and
resolve a series of structural problems before formulating a programme.'
Brazil is anxious for a new accord in order to move towards concluding the
restructuring of Dollars 44bn in foreign debt, for which it must put up
Dollars 3.2bn in collateral, at least half of which it hopes to obtain from
multilateral institutions.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission has ordered the sales subsidiaries of four
leading electronics companies, Matsushita Electric Industrial, Sony, Hitachi
and Toshiba, to allow retailers to discount their products without fear of
losing supply contracts.
An investigation by the FTC, the anti-monopoly body, found evidence that the
four companies had ordered large retailers not to discount the prices of
electronics goods below certain specified levels.
FTC investigators also said that at least one of the companies is believed
to have offered incentives to retailers who complied with the pricing orders
and threatened to cut supplies to retailers who dared to discount deeper
than the recommended level.
The case highlights the close relationship between each of the four
companies and their extensive network of small dealers, who are believed to
have complained to the companies that their sales were hurt by discounting
by larger retailers.
A recent flurry of activity by the FTC follows past complaints by US trade
officials, who alleged that the Commission was unwilling or unable to
enforce Japan's anti-monopoly laws. They demanded that the Commission's
investigative staff be strengthened.
The Commission's investigations have almost doubled in the past two years,
but US officials have continued to suggest that the FTC is unwilling to
tackle the country's better known companies or unravel the often complex
relationships between large manufacturers and retailers.
The present case is linked to an FTC order to Japanese manufacturers in July
1991, making clear that retailers were free to set their own prices.
Last year, sales arms of the four electronics companies indicated to the FTC
that they would abide by the advisory, but investigations into their trading
practices continued.
If the electronics companies defied the FTC's order, they could be fined,
but they indicated yesterday that executives would 'study' the order to see
how it affected their business practices.
Sumitomo Chemical of Japan and Rhone-Poulenc, are forming a joint venture
company to develop and market agricultural chemicals in France, Michiyo
Nakamoto adds from Tokyo.
Sumitomo, which has a worldwide agrochemical business worth about Y6bn
(Pounds 31.9m) to Y7bn and is a leader in the field in Japan, will own a
large majority share of the new company, the company said. The joint
venture, to be staffed mainly by Rhone-Poulenc employees, will mostly market
the French company's products, but is expected to to develop and market
Sumitomo's agrochemicals in future.

FT  11 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Potholes in the private road to public
utilities - Turkey's BOT system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ROY Watts, chairman of Thames Water, the privatised UK water authority,
must have thought the deal was in the bag when he flew to Ankara last Friday
to sign up for a Dollars 700m (Pounds 460m) dam project using the Build
Operate and Transfer BOT form of financing, a concept pioneered by Turkey.
As it turned out, there appeared still to be some details to attend to.
Thames now hopes to initial an implementation agreement in the next couple
of weeks, but that, as a number of contractors have discovered, is just the
first hurdle.
The attempt to revive BOT, a method of franchise financing which uses
private sector debt to fund public infrastructure, reflects the desperate
state of public finances in Turkey. The move also underscores a personal
rivalry between Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel and the man who more or less
invented the BOT concept, President Turgut Ozal.
Under BOT, a contractor owns a plant for a set period - in Thames' case 15
years - before transfering it to the public utility. The contractor arranges
finance, repaying the debt with revenues generated from the project.
Turkey is currently looking at three big schemes. The Thames Water project
at Izmit, south-east of Istanbul, involves dam construction, pumping
stations and more than 60 miles of water mains.
At Birecik on the Euphrates, a consortium led by Philipp Holzmann of Germany
is looking at a DM2bn (Pounds 800m) hydro-electric scheme.
Discussions are under way with Enron, the US engineering giant, on three
combined cycle gas and oil power stations at a total project cost of Dollars
2bn.
The beauty of BOT is that it enables the government to finance public
infrastructure 'off balance sheet' as it shifts the risk from the government
to the private sector. This is a key factor at a time when outstanding
public and private external debt is Dollars 56bn.
In addition, bankers argue that because the private sector is taking the
risk, BOT will ensure more rigorous project disciplines. The onus is on the
private sector developer to see the project is viable and can be completed
on time - otherwise he cannot recover his costs.
Another attraction is that the consortium's financing will typically
incorporate an equity element, in effect bringing in foreign capital
investment which would not be available under a turnkey government project.
However, where BOT has come unstuck is where discussion turns to the levels
of guarantee available in the securities package. The traditional concerns
are currency risk, resource risk and, most critical of all, protection
against force majeure, where natural or other disasters prevent the
contractor from completing, leaving the question as to who has to repay the
banks.
As a first stage, Thames has to sign an implementation agreement which gives
the consortium the licence to sell water, hitherto the state's legal
monopoly. Perhaps inevitably, there is already some opposition within Public
Works, the agency handling state sector water projects, which is naturally
reluctant to see its powers curtailed by a private sector developer in an
area traditionally handled by government.
Accounting for resource risk will be just as challenging. According to Chase
Manhattan, which is advising Thames, the Izmit authority will undertake to
buy 140m cubic metres of water a year. The terms of the offtake agreement in
effect means the purchaser pays for the water whether or not he takes
delivery - the only way these BOT schemes can hope to work.
Thames has also to secure an offtake arrangement with the Istanbul water
authority, under which the Izmit authority will sell water on to its
Istanbul counterpart.
On the Birecik scheme, for example, where Chase is also the adviser, the
consortium has to secure a sales agreement with TEK, the state-owned power
utility to buy the project's electricity. In addition, an accord has to be
struck with DSI, the state hydraulics corporation, to guarantee that the
Ataturk dam upstream discharges a certain volume of water to enable
Birecik's turbines to operate.
The price has then to be agreed, denominated in a hard currency. On the
Ankara metro scheme, one of the reasons BOT failed to attract bank support
was the difficulty matching the project's external debt servicing needs with
the Turkish lira revenue flows from the metro's tolls.
If these problems seem surmountable, the parties are expected to have more
difficulty agreeing a formula in the case of force majeure interrupting the
revenue flows, and in turn affecting the ability of the developer to repay
the banks.
Chase is using a subordinated loan mechanism, in effect a standby facility
which will repay the banks in the event of force majeure. Again, the Ankara
metro, which the Treasury eventually decided to finance with a full
sovereign guarantee, envisaged an unlimited subordinated loan, another
reason that the BOT scheme collapsed.
During construction, Chase has set the level of the loan at Dollars 270m,
which falls away to Dollars 50m during the less risky operational period.
However, it is still unclear who will be the subordinated lender. Some
observers fear this could still prove the project's Achilles heel.

SINAR Mas, an Indonesian industrial group, plans to build a Rs3bn (Pounds
62m) paper mill in India.
The company, Indonesia's second largest combine, is submitting a proposal to
the Indian government for a 200,000 tonnes a year paper mill. The mill would
import pulp for conversion into paper for sale in India and other south
Asian countries.
The project is one of several investment schemes in India proposed by
foreign companies since the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister, embarked on economic liberalisation in mid-1991. The authorities
last year approved investments totalling about Dollars 1.3bn. But the actual
flow of funds has been much smaller - around Dollars 300m. It is not clear
how quickly Sinar Mas will go ahead with its scheme.
Mr M K Raina, a leading executive in the Indian paper industry who is to
head the Indonesian group's Indian operation, said Sinar Mas would invest a
total of Dollars 1bn in India over five years in various projects including
the paper mill.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Clinton signs orders to reduce government payroll and perks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday continued his attack on excessive federal
employment by signing executive orders designed to reduce the government
payroll by 100,000 over the next four years.
He also directed departments to cut their management costs by 3 per cent a
year over the next four years, to get rid of as many as one third of
existing advisory boards and commissions, and to eliminate a wide range of
the perks available to senior bureaucrats.
The president estimated net savings of about Dollars 9bn and repeated his
exhortation of Tuesday, when he announced a 25 per cent reduction in the
White House staff, that government must learn to get by on less. 'This is
only a beginning, not the end,' he added.
Additionally, Mr Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary, announced that he
was reviewing special bonus payments made to senior members of his
department by Mr Manuul Lujan, his predecessor. The leitmotif of Mr
Clinton's drive to cut the size and cost of government is the presumed
excesses of the Bush and Reagan administrations.
Most of the job savings will be achieved by natural wastage, not
redundancies, the White House said. All departmental plans must be in place
by 1995. Total federal employment is around 3m, including the notionally
independent and 800,000-strong postal service.
Mr Clinton was expected to make much of his symbolic lead in cutting federal
spending at a televised 'town meeting' in Detroit, due to take place late
last night.
Mr Babbitt said his most interesting discovery was the 'pony perk,' a plan
to expand a federally maintained equestrian complex for the convenience of
government officials. That particular plan is dead as of today,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
QATAR's state-owned steel company, just emerging from cumulative losses of
Dollars 100m in the 1980s, is set to award a Dollars 275m (Pounds 182m)
contract to nearly double capacity with the aim of exporting to Far Eastern
markets.
Qatar Steel Company (Qasco), which is 70 per cent owned by the Qatar
government, said 25 foreign companies have submitted bids for the project
and a decision is expected within weeks. Mr Nasser al-Mansouri, head of the
company, was quoted in the United Arab Emirates newspaper al Khaleej as
saying that building would begin before the end of this year.
A new plant will be built under the expansion to raise capacity from the
present 560,000 tonnes of reinforced steel bars by between 300,000 tonnes
and 500,000 tonnes. The company's present plant, built in 1978 at a cost of
Dollars 300m, has for several years been operating at around 70 per cent of
its design capacity.
Qatar plans to capitalise on its considerable resources of cheap gas from
its north field operations.
Mr al-Mansouri said Qasco will have to double its paid-up capital of Dollars
82m which, he said, would be welcomed by the company's present foreign
partners. Two Japanese groups, Kobe Steel and Tokyo Boeki, hold 20 and 10
per cent of Qasco respectively. The company would not comment on how the
recapitalisation and expansion would affect its shareholding structure.
Qasco last year made sales of Dollars 192m and record profits of Dollars
40m, largely through sales to neighbouring Gulf countries, Algeria, Iran and
Egypt. The group's recent profits have enabled it to clear deficits incurred
during the mid-1980s and Mr al-Mansouri said the company expects to complete
repayment by next year of loans taken to build Qasco's existing plant.
The company is aiming to broaden its market , towards the potentially vast
Iranian market and the Far East.

<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US last night committed itself to the international effort to end
fighting in Bosnia. It named a special envoy to assist the efforts of Mr
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the UN and EC negotiators.
Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, also said the US was prepared
'to do its share to enforce a settlement'. Without discussing details, he
said this could mean sending US forces, along with UN and Nato counterparts,
to ensure that any peace agreement was sustained.
The US plan was warmly welcomed in New York by Mr Vance and Lord Owen. When
they arrived a week ago at the UN for a final negotiating push, both had
feared the US would opt to rearm the Bosnian Moslems.
Mr Christopher said this had been seriously considered but rejected after
consultation with Britain, France and Canada, which advised that their
forces already in Bosnia would be 'gravely endangered' by such a move.
Similar considerations, he added, constrained the present use of US air
power.
As Mr Christopher outlined it, the US approach involved 'active engagement'
in the Vance-Owen plan, 'bringing the full weight of US diplomacy to bear.'
He said: 'We do not expect a miracle but we believe we can make a
difference.'
Mr Christopher conceded that he had feared that the Vance-Owen plan might be
imposed on the warring parties. 'We will not arrive with a map and we have
no prescribed solution,' he said.
The US special envoy to the negotiations will be Mr Reggie Bartholomew,
currently US ambassador to Nato, a selection which is understood to have
pleased Lord Owen.
Mr Bartholomew will first fly to Moscow to confer with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin. President Bill Clinton discussed the US plan with Mr Yeltsin
by phone. The Russian leader was supportive, Mr Christopher said.
President Clinton is also sending a message to all the warring parties that
only a negotiated settlement can end the conflict and that one will not be
'imposed'.
But, in an explicit warning to Serbia, he is seeking tighter economic
sanctions to deter a widening of the war.
Mr Christopher would not be drawn on any US military commitment, but
stressed that any agreement should contain 'quite viable enforcement
procedures'.
He said 'our conscience revolts' at the evidence of Serbian ethnic
cleansing, murders, rapes, shelling, the forced displacement of peoples and
'atrocities committed by others as well'.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Golden screen haunts LDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MYSTERY of the golden screen is haunting Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party.
This unsolved case of alleged corruption - involving banks, senior
politicians and an exquisite Y4bn (Pounds 23m) traditional folding screen -
has resurfaced this week, at a particularly bad time for Mr Noboru
Takeshita, the former prime minister.
He is to appear before parliament next week - with Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former
LDP secretary-general - to answer questions over a separate scandal
involving illegal donations by a road haulage company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin.
Opposition parties delayed the passage of the budget for the fiscal year to
begin in April, so as to force the LDP to offer the two politicians for
formal questioning. This will be the third such appearance in recent months
by Mr Takeshita.
Simultaneously, a former auditor at Heiwa Sogo, the small bank at the centre
of the screen mystery, is on trial for commercial breach of trust, and is
expected to explain at least part of the background to the mystery in coming
days. His testimony could provide opposition politicians with a further
opportunity to undermine Mr Takeshita, who has resisted demands that he
resign from parliament.
The gold-leaf screen mystery began in 1985, when there was a struggle for
the control of the ailing Heiwa Sogo, and four of its executives sold the
screen for Y4bn to a Toyko art gallery. It had just been valued at only
Y500m. Some of the sale proceeds were used to buy shares in Heiwa Sogo, but
it is alleged that other funds were given to politicians, including Y300m to
a secretary to Mr Takeshita, according to court testimony by former
executives at the bank.
But the secretary, Mr Ihei Aoki, who is at the centre of the mystery,
committed suicide in April 1989 amid another scandal, the Recruit
stocks-for-favours affair. This was the scandal which ultimately forced Mr
Takeshita to resign as prime minister.
Japanese prosecutors are also attempting to link the sale of the golden
screen to the eventual takeover of Heiwa Sogo by Sumitomo Bank in October
1986, though there is no suggestion that the latter bank has done wrong.
Mr Takeshita, who knew executives at both banks, is believed to have played
a role in bringing them together, and opposition politicians want to him to
clarify whether he saw Y300m.
Late last year, Mr Takeshita said the affair was also a mystery to him.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Move to make Japanese groups more transparent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT advisory panel has recommended that companies be required to
appoint independent auditors, in an attempt to make corporate Japan more
transparent and less prone to scandal.
The Justice Ministry is likely to draft legislation to amend the commercial
code based on the panel's recommendations, but the changes will be opposed
by many companies, as auditing has traditionally been an in-house operation
in Japan.
A spate of securities industry scandals and demands for increased
shareholder rights prompted the panel's review, which included a study of
whether companies should be able to buy their own shares. No formal
recommendation was made on this controversial issue.
But the panel did recommend that shareholders should have improved access to
company accounts.
Under present legislation, shareholders must have at least a 10 per cent
stake in the company before getting access to the account books, but the
minimum shareholding needed is likely to be reduced to 3 per cent.
That change, and a simpler court filing process for class actions, are in
line with US demands for an improvement in shareholder rights in Japan.
The demand was made during the bilateral Structural Impediments Initiative
(SII) talks, designed to reduce the 'structural' obstacles to trade.
The panel also recommended that restrictions on corporate bond issues be
eased, in particular a requirement that companies must issue bonds to a
total less than twice the net value of its assets.
Corporate bonds are becoming increasingly popular among Japanese companies,
but there are still strict limits on bond trading and issuance.
These and other recommendations, approved yesterday by a sub-committee in
the justice ministry, are scheduled to be formally presented to the justice
minister later this month, and then to a cabinet meeting next month.
If the panel's proposals are adopted, an auditor's term will be extended
from two to three years, while companies capitalised at Y500m (Pounds 2.6m)
or more, or with debts of Y20bn or more, must appoint three auditors, one
more than is now required.
But most controversial is the requirement that one of three auditors should
be independent. Japanese companies have traditionally appointed auditors
from among middle-managers passed over for promotion to the senior ranks or
from among executives due to retire but wanting to maintain a presence
within the company.
Auditors still generally regard themselves as part of the company and it is
highly unusual for them to find fault with financial statements.
By the panel's standards, an independent auditor is an individual who has
not worked for the company, or any of its subsidiaries, during the past five
years.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UN soldiers fail to pacify the killing fields: The Cambodian
peace keepers were welcomed with relief a year ago but their popularity is
waning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY came at midnight, a dozen men firing automatic weapons and grenades at
a crowd of villagers who were dancing and watching videos outside a Buddhist
temple.
The party a few nights ago in the village of Sret, 12 miles east of Siem
Reap and the ancient Khmer monuments of Angkor, was an annual festival in
memory of a former abbot. Eight people were killed, including a 13-year-old
girl.
Nobody is sure who carried out the attack or why, but Khmer Rouge guerrillas
are among the suspects; three of the dead were government policemen.
Two days later the village looked sleepy and surprisingly cheerful. Yes, the
inhabitants agreed, they were frightened at night now, but they had lived
through bad times before.
They had survived the rule of Prince Sihanouk in the 1950s and 1960s, the
dictatorship of Lon Nol, who overthrew the prince, the terror of the Khmer
Rouge guerrillas who ousted Lon Nol, and the Vietnamese invasion which got
rid of the Khmer Rouge. Now they had Untac.
Untac - the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia - was immensely popular
when it was established in March last year because Cambodians thought it
would stop the killing. It has failed to do so, and its popularity is waning
fast.
Bangladeshi troops are stationed three miles from Sret, but they did nothing
because the attack on the village lasted only five or 10 minutes before the
gunmen melted into the countryside.
It was not an isolated incident. In the early hours of yesterday morning
gunmen, some of them on motorcycles, attacked Siem Reap with guns and
grenades, killing at least two Cambodians and firing at Untac's
pre-frabricated offices.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the head of Untac, said he viewed the assault with 'the
utmost seriousness'. Siem Reap is Cambodia's main tourist destination, and
President Francois Mitterrand of France is due to go there this week to see
the temples of Angkor.
The failure of the UN's largest peace keeping operation, with its Dollars
2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) budget and its complement of 22,000 soldiers and
civilians, is as damaging for the reputation of the UN as it is for the
hopes of the Cambodian people.
Untac has succeeded neither in bringing about the ceasefire agreed by all
the factions at the Paris peace conference in 1991, nor in curbing banditry.
Mutilated corpses are still seen floating down the Mekong river, and
government troops continue to extort money from passing cars and river
boats.
In one particularly humiliating incident on a road north of Phnom Penh last
month, unarmed Untac troops from Poland saw soldiers shoot dead the driver
of a van that had failed to stop at a casual roadblock; then the Poles
watched helplessly as the soldiers killed the two passengers in the van in
cold blood.
Untac's reputation has been further undermined by traffic accidents
involving the UN's big white cars as well as the inevitable problems of
whoring and drinking in a country where both are cheap.
There have been successes. Indian army doctors at the Untac field hospital
in Siem Reap, for example, have been treating dozens of Cambodians for
tuberculosis.
The continuing repatriation of 370,000 refugees from Thailand has been
running much more smoothly than expected; and Untac electoral officers have
registered 4.7m Cambodians for the general election in May.
But even these successes are now at risk. In its announcement last week of a
government offensive against the Khmer Rouge, Untac disclosed that some
returned refugees had been conscripted by the government and used as forced
labour.
Worst of all, there are doubts about whether Untac can ensure that the
elections are 'free and fair', as required by the Paris peace accords.
Yesterday Mr Akashi acknow-ledged that he was 'still not satisfied that the
conditions for free and fair elections can be met'.
The troops and guerrillas of the four main factions should by now have been
regrouped in cantonment areas and disarmed, but the disarmament process was
abandoned when the Khmer Rouge refused to co-operate.
UN military observers say the civil war, now essentially between the
Vietnamese-installed government and the Khmer Rouge, has intensified since
1991, and both sides are using their weapons to intimidate voters.
Khmer Rouge guerrillas, as well as refusing Untac officials access to most
of their territory in north-western Cambodia, have seized voter registration
cards from villagers in contested areas.
Government soldiers are suspected of killing more than 20 people working for
the royalist party Funcinpec and have been accused by UN electoral officers
of widespread intimidation in the last few weeks.
Untac's response has been extraordinarily phlegmatic in the face of repeated
setbacks. Lt-Gen John Sanderson, the Untac military commander, has been
nicknamed 'No Problem' because of his apparently incurable optimism.
Untac's defence is that it cannot impose peace by force; it is for the
Cambodians to fulfil their obligations and for Untac to help them do so.
Certainly Cambodians must accept their share of the blame. Prince Sihanouk,
regarded by Cambodians and foreigners alike as the one man who might be able
to broker a deal between the various factions, has been spending more time
in Beijing than at home.
The Khmer Rouge has flouted the peace agreement and the ceasefire from the
start, while on the government side corrupt officials have filled their
pockets with ill-gotten gains in the expectation of losing much of their
power after the election.
If the elections go ahead as planned in May - and the expectation at the
moment is that they will in spite of the fighting - Funcinpec is likely to
emerge as the strongest party in the new assembly.
The outcome of the resultant imbalance between political and military power
is that Prince Sihanouk, who could become president, and his son Prince
Ranariddh, the Funcinpec leader and possible future prime minister, will
probably try to construct a coalition to accommodate both the Khmer Rouge
and the present regime.
Not everyone believes it will be possible to reconcile the two factions
which are even now fighting each other across much of northern and western
Cambodia. 'I think regardless of what happens during the elections, you're
going to have civil war immediately afterwards,' says one senior Untac
military officer. 'I think it's going to be pretty intense, and I think it
will reach Phnom Penh.' That view is a pessimistic one, but it is not
unique.

political domination by the ageing supporters of Chiang Kai-shek, its
founder, by appointing the first native Taiwanese, Mr Lien Chan, to be prime
minister.
Taiwan has been shaken by political instability in recent months, as former
Nationalist soldiers have fought to retain a vestige of control within the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party against President Lee's reformist Mainstream
faction. The old guard has finally lost.
The stock market surged initially on the long-expected news, seen as
providing a seal of approval for President Lee's pro-business policies. But
a late sell-off by profit-takers led yesterday's Taipei index to close 59
points lower at 3,578.
Mr Lien, 56, former governor of Taiwan Province, is from one of Taiwan's
wealthiest families.
Deemed an uncharismatic man, he is expected to act as an executive
lieutenant to Mr Lee, without providing any political challenge. With Mr
Lien's appointment, President Lee is finally in a position to push forward a
democratic reform programme with a minimum of opposition from within his own
party.
His success has surprised many analysts, following his poor performance in
December's parliamentary elections when the KMT received its lowest-ever
vote of 53 per cent.

THE Japanese car industry and authorities yesterday welcomed the decision by
the US big three car-makers not to file a dumping suit against Japanese
manufacturers, but expressed continuing concern over protectionist
tendencies in the US, Michiyo Nakamoto writes from Tokyo.
The ministry of international trade and industry said the decision reflected
a sensible judgment. Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan automobile
manufacturers' association, said it was the 'right decision'. He reiterated
the industry's belief it had not been dumping in the US market.

FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand, the first western head of state to
visit Vietnam, yesterday urged President Bill Clinton to lift the US embargo
imposed on Hanoi in 1964, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
After a two-day visit to Hanoi, Mr Mitterrand described the embargo as 'an
anachronism'. Washington extended the embargo to all of Vietnam in 1975,
when Hanoi's communists defeated the US-backed Saigon government and
reunified the country.
Mr Mitterrand announced on Tuesday that France would double its 1992 aid to
Vietnam this year. France gave Vietnam Dollars 36m (Pounds 23.8m) in 1992.
Yesterday, he said seven top-level co-operation agreements had been signed
between the two countries.
Vietnam, hit three years ago by the suspension of Soviet aid and now starved
for capital, had approached France 'with outstretched hands', Mr Mitterrand
said.
He said it was appropriate for France, given its past ties with Vietnam, to
be the first western country to help it reintegrate into the world
community.
Mr Mitterrand yesterday visited Dien Bien Phu, where forces led by Gen Vo
Nguyen Giap defeated a key French army unit in 1954, thus bringing an end to
colonial rule.
Reuter adds: Alcatel of France yesterday signed an agreement with the
Vietnamese Post and Telecommunications Authority to create a digital
switching joint venture called Alcatel Network Systems Vietnam.

Iraq yesterday turned down an appeal to release two Britons serving long

Mr Michael Whitlam, director general of the British Red Cross, said he had
offered Iraq's deputy prime minister, Mr Tariq Aziz, further humanitarian
assistance to the Iraqi people if Mr Michael Wainwright and Mr Paul Ride
were set free. Mr Wainwright, 42, was sentenced to 10 years after cycling
into Iraq from Turkey last May. Mr Ride, 33, was jailed last August for
seven years for straying across the border from Kuwait.

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S exports in December fell 12.5 per cent to Dollars 1.48bn (Pounds
980m), against the equivalent month in 1991, due to weak demand in the
former Soviet Union, the disruptive impact of a prolonged domestic airline
strike and unrest following destruction of the Ayodhya mosque.
The figures, released yesterday, confirm the damage done to foreign trade by
disruption to travel caused by the strike, and through the violence in
Indian cities after the mosque was sacked on December 6.
The fall in exports will hit hopes of achieving a target of 10 per cent
export growth in the year to the end of March 1993. A boost to exports is a
key element in India's economic reform programme. It needs them to pay for
imports of oil and capital equipment.
Imports in December grew 2.6 per cent to Dollars 1.94bn, making for a
monthly trade deficit of Dollars 460m. For the nine months to end-December,
the deficit was Dollars 3.55bn, more than double the Dollars 1.63bn in the
equivalent period of 1991.
Exports rose 3.4 per cent, with those to countries outside the former Soviet
bloc up 11.4 per cent. Imports for the nine months rose 16.5 per cent.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Delors seeks to elevate EC concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commission president Jacques Delors yesterday launched his most
stinging attack to date on the 'renationalisation' of economic policy in the
EC, which, through competitive devaluations, was jeopardising plans for
economic and monetary union and 'the very idea of a united Europe'.
He warned that Brussels 'will take up the cudgels again' to get
controversial items of the EC's social charter, chief among them the
European works councils directive, into Community law.
Mr Delors was presenting the Commission programme for 1993-94 to the
European parliament, after socialist MEPs had led threats of a vote of no
confidence in the EC executive, complaining of its 'minimalist' policy
ambitions and democratic shortcomings.
In a combative speech, pleading for a renewal of faith in Europe, Mr Delors
called on the EC and its member states to 'stop contemplating their navels.
'The people of Europe are asking: Are you capable of coming up with an
economic and social programme that will stem the tide of unemployment and
give us confidence in the future?'
Mr Delors has shown signs in the past 10 days of returning to the offensive
after the political near-hibernation enforced on the Commission in the wake
of Danish voters' rejection of the Maastricht treaty.
The Edinburgh summit in December restored optimism that Denmark and the UK
will now ratify the treaty but colleagues acknowledge that Mr Delors  - who
wrote yesterday's 'state of the union' address himself - is treading a fine
line. 'We've been told to keep our heads down on anything affecting
ratification. . . . or which could be seen as power-grabbing,' says one
senior Commission official. 'But we have agreed to take a firm line on
principle.'
Although he named no member state, Mr Delors seemed yesterday to aim his
sharpest barbs at the UK, as he urged co-ordination in macroeconomic and
monetary policy against 'the siren voices tempting us to go it alone', and
vowed to make the EC's social charter - rejected by the UK - a reality.
'Competitive devaluations are not the solution to the problems facing us
today; history teaches us otherwise,' Mr Delors insisted, echoing French
premier Pierre Beregovoy's attack on the UK for pushing sterling down at the
expense of other EC currencies.
He also implicated Germany in his critique, referring to the 'glimmer of
hope' brought by last week's German interest rate cuts, after 'months of
expensive pussy-footing'.
MEPs voted by 271:95 to approve the new Commission.

THE German government's plan to impose a new road tax on autobahn users ran
into a barrage of abuse yesterday, mostly from motorists.
As Germans woke up to the fact that their favourite weekend pastime -
alternately dicing with death at unlimited speeds, and sitting in autobahn
traffic jams - was going to cost them up to DM400 (Pounds 166) a year, the
flak started flying.
Mr Otto Flimm, president of ADAC, the motorists' club, said his members
already paid petrol taxes and it was unreasonable to make them pay twice. He
suggested a special tax on lorries.
Mr Ekkehard Gries, transport spokesman of the Free Democrats (FDP), the
crusading free marketeers in the ruling coalition, called the plan 'nothing
more than money-skimming'.
Even the left wing, anti-motor lobby was critical. Mr Franz Steinkuhler,
leader of the engineering union, IG Metall, called it 'an act of monumental
dim-wittedness'.
The Greens said making motorists pay to drive on motorways would only
encourage them to use them more, in order to get value for their money.
According to an instant opinion poll by the Forsa research institute, 46 per
cent of Germans will stop using the autobahns if the charge is introduced.
Some 12 per cent said they would take to public transport, and 37 per cent
will carry on regardless.
The final blow came from Mr Klaus Steffenhagen, chairman of the police trade
union in North Rhine-Westphalia, where a web of autobahns covers the
industrial heartland. He said his members were already overworked and
underpaid, and would not enforce the new system. 'We will fight this one all
the way,' he said, 'to make sure our members don't have to turn into tax
inspectors.'
The extraordinary backlash took Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his colleagues by
surprise. The transport ministry hastily explained that the tax was only a
first step, to an electronic toll system which would charge motorists by the
mile.
Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, said no date for its
introduction, nor any figure for the motorway charge, had been agreed.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Belgians promise to defend franc amid new ERM jitters

BELGIUM said yesterday it would use 'all possible means' to defend its
currency, as the Belgian franc was caught up in the latest bout of
nervousness in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
The Belgian National Bank raised its end-of-day interest rates - applied to
primary dealers and banks' daily currency investments - from 8.8 per cent to
9.3 per cent, to help protect the currency.
The step helped the Belgian franc to strengthen within the ERM, after
several days of weakness.
Belgium's interest rate action, countering the recent trend of lower
European credit costs, came as the German Bundesbank yesterday fractionally
cut its money market rates.
In its first money market operations since it cut the Lombard and discount
rates last Thursday, the Bundesbank reduced its securities repurchase rate
from 8.57-8.58 per cent to 8.50-8.51 per cent.
The cut was smaller than expected after the Bundesbank had cut the Lombard
rate by 0.5 of a point and the discount rate by 0.25 of a point.
In a move related to last week's heavy ERM intervention to support the
Danish krone, Denmark's central bank yesterday borrowed Dollars 1bn in the
international bond market to strengthen its foreign exchange reserves.
Mr Niels Sorensen, a senior official at Denmark's National Bank, said the
central bank's reserves had fallen considerably in February. 'When the
speculation subsides, money usually flows back (into the krone) but, since
we are not sure when that will be, we thought it would be a good idea to do
some borrowing,' Mr Sorensen said.
Mr Alfons Verplaetse, governor of the Belgian central bank, said he could
not envisage a situation in which the German and French central banks would
collaborate to support the French franc and the D-Mark, leaving the Benelux
currencies undefended.
Analysts say the Belgian franc - one of the strongest ERM currencies during
the last few months - is being hit by doubts about Belgium's slowing economy
and growing budget deficit. It is also being affected by uncertainty about
the future of the country after the vote to transform Belgium into a federal
state.

'It's true to say that the currency markets are very nervous, but whatever

Mr Verplaetse added that he was sure the French franc was 'a solid

He said he could not envisage a situation in which the German and French
central banks would collaborate to support the French franc and the D-Mark,
leaving the Benelux currencies undefended.
Analysts say the Belgian franc - one of the strongest ERM currencies during

the political future of the country after Saturday's vote to transform
Belgium into a federal state.
Dealers believe the Belgian central bank last week widened slightly the
narrow ERM band within which it has held the franc steady against the D-Mark
since 1990.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government yesterday produced its gloomiest annual economic
report in a decade, forecasting a decline in gross domestic product of up to
1 per cent. It was promptly attacked by the opposition for excessive
optimism.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the newly appointed economics minister, said all the
economic indicators for west Germany were negative at the turn of the year,
including industrial orders, production levels, investment activity,
capacity utilisation and - above all - unemployment.
In the east, however, there were a few hopeful signs, especially in
construction activity and the service sector, although the economic recovery
was still decidedly hesitant, he said.
The other element of extremely cautious optimism to emerge from the report,
presented to both cabinet and parliament yesterday, was the forecast that
wages will grow by less than the rate of inflation in the coming year. Gross
wages would rise between 2.5 and 3 per cent, compared with price rises of
about 3.5 per cent, it suggests.
Mr Rexrodt said the priority for the German government must be to avoid
slipping into an all-out recession, although Mr Otto Lambsdorff, his own
party leader in the Free Democrats (FDP), says the economy is already in its
sharpest post-war recession.
The minister stressed the importance of the solidarity pact under discussion
between the central government, the 16 Lander and the opposition Social
Democrats, as well as employers and trade unions.
He said he had been instructed to produce by September a report on how to
improve the attractiveness of Germany as an investment location, reducing
the high cost structure and increasing labour mobility.
The key figures in the government's forecast for the year are a decline in
GDP of between zero and 1 per cent for west Germany, an expansion of 5 to 7
per cent in the east, with an all-German forecast of zero growth.
Average unemployment in the west is predicted to rise by some 450,000 to
2.25m, or a rate of 7.5 per cent, and to increase only marginally in the
east to about 1.2m, a rate of 15 to 16 per cent. The national unemployment
average would be 9 per cent, the report says.
It forecasts a growth in exports of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent in the west (8 to 10
per cent in the east, where exports to eastern Europe have collapsed), based
on the assumption of a steady revival in world trade, especially in the US
economy.
It is based on important assumptions: of a successful conclusion to the Gatt
round of trade liberalisation talks, gradual easing of international
interest rates, a slight depreciation in the D-Mark's value, substantial
efforts to restrict public spending, and wage moderation (including a
slowdown in the rate of equalisation of eastern and western wages). It
particularly criticises the 'blatant disproportion' between unit wage costs
in east and west Germany, with the former now 60 per cent higher than the
west, in spite of the collapse of the eastern economy.
Mr Wolfgang Roth, SPD economics spokesman, said there was no clear
indication where the 5-7 per cent growth rate in east Germany would come
from, given the collapse of east German industry. A zero overall national
growth rate would require an immediate reversal of a steady contraction.
He sharply criticised the Bundesbank for its failure to cut its lead
interest rates more aggressively. He said last week's cuts - half a
percentage point of the Lombard rate, from 9.5 to 9 per cent, and a quarter
point off the discount rate, to 8 per cent - were a 'mincing step' which was
'pure poison for the economy'.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Barre sounds the alarm over Anglo-Saxon ambush of franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CURRENCY markets will launch a heavy but unsuccessful attack against the
franc next month, during the French parliamentary election, according to Mr
Raymond Barre, former prime minister of France.
Mr Barre, a leading proponent of the hard franc policy and a senior ally of
the UDF centre-right party, said the attack will be inspired by Anglo-Saxon
financial institutions unwilling to see the creation of a European currency
which could rival the dollar. He does not suspect any government influence,
he emphasised. The attack will be beaten off by joint intervention by the
Banque de France and the Bundesbank.
'I am not among those who see plots everywhere. It's not at all my
temperament. But I really think there is a will in a certain number of
economic and financial circles not to promote - in fact to do everything to
prevent - the creation of European monetary and economic union, and in
consequence to blow up the EMS,' said Mr Barre.
He would not be drawn further, beyond saying that he knew of a research
study by (unidentified) financial institutions analysing the risks posed by
a single European currency for their own businesses. 'It's my absolute and
objective conviction. I expect, as a result, that there will be a strong
assault on the franc before the elections, or in the period of the elections
or just after the elections,' he said.
The vote, on March 21 and 28, is likely to produce a record parliamentary
majority for the opposition centre-right alliance of the RPR, which is
divided over the Maastricht treaty on political and monetary union, and the
pro-European UDF. 'When these foreign circles see that a strong part of RPR
is hostile to the Maastricht treaty and to French monetary policy, they ask
themselves if a government of the new majority tomorrow would be unified
enough to hold the political line.'
The right-wing leaders are so firmly in favour of holding to the franc fort
policy that the new government would find it very difficult to let the franc
float or to go for devaluation, he argued. 'Absolute determination' will be
required of the new administration.
If monetary union succeeds in some form, as Mr Barre believes it will, he
argues that the new European currency will have the status of a widely used
commercial, financial and reserve currency, similar to sterling at the end
of the 19th century. 'The day you have a European currency which is used in
the trade exchanges of the first commercial power in the world, the European
Community, the day when it's possible for Community banks to use the Ecu,
and when their reserves will be held in the Ecu, we will have the real
alternative to the dollar. Money is power - that's what it's about,' said Mr
Barre.
He believes that the future currency, possible towards the end of the
decade, will initially include seven (France, Germany, the three Benelux
countries, Spain and Italy) or eight members.
The Bundesbank will again support the French currency in the speculative
attack likely next month, partly because 'it won't want to take the risk of
letting the EMS collapse. The Bundesbank cannot take this responsibility.'
But, just as important, said Mr Barre, is that 'the Bundesbank considers
that the fundamentals of the French economy are satisfactory. I am convinced
that, if the fundamentals had been negative, the Bundesbank would never have
supported them, even in taking into consideration the political factors.'

FT  11 FEB 93 / Ukraine's shipping minister sacked

<TEXT>
THE Ukrainian government yesterday sacked Mr Viktor Pylypenko, the merchant
marine minister, amid allegations of corruption. He is accused of
involvement in corruption at the Black Sea Shipping Company, which a
government commission alleges evaded up to Dollars 20m in taxes and sold
more than 30 ships illegally.
The decision to sack the minister - part of a wider anti-corruption drive
launched by Mr Leonid Kushma, the prime minister - must be approved by the
Ukrainian parliament, of which Mr Pylypenko is a member.
A spokesman for the government accused him this week of having spent more
than Dollars 100,000 to build a lavish bathroom in his office.
The allegations yesterday are the most recent charges to be levelled against
the company. With 206 vessels, it is Ukraine's largest shipping concern, and
a potential magnet for foreign investors.

FT  11 FEB 93 / French right plans state sell-offs: Two opposition parties
unveil manifesto for March elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAX reforms and state spending cuts, and an estimated FFr50bn (Pounds
6.25bn) worth of privatisations over three years are promised in an election
manifesto presented jointly yesterday by France's two centre-right
opposition parties.
Greeted as 'empty, vague and worrying' by the ruling Socialists, the
programme is less sweeping than that of the previous right-wing government
in 1986-1988 and reflects the opposition's limited room for manoeuvre at a
time of slow growth and monetary instability. 'Clarity, change and
prudence,' were the key words, said Mr Francois Bayrou, UDF secretary
general.
The opposition alliance, fighting as UPF or Union for France, is set to win
the elections, on March 21 and 28, by a record margin, with around
two-thirds of the seats in the national assembly, according to recent polls.
Yet the manifesto does little to reconcile splits between the pro-European
UDF and the Gaullist RPR, half of whose national assembly deputies voted
against the Maastricht treaty on European monetary and political union last
year.
On monetary policy, the future French government says it will present plans
in the spring to make the Bank of France independent and do all that is
needed to support the franc. It proposes a joint Franco-German monetary
initiative 'so as not to lose the achievements of 13 years' co-operation in
the EMS'. This is likely to antagonise the anti-Maastricht faction in the
RPR.
On privatisation, the UPF plans to sell all state-owned banks, insurers and
industrial companies operating in competitive markets. An independent agency
will set share prices and select stable shareholders for the privatisation
candidates. A significant amount of shares will be reserved for private
investors.
State monopolies, like telecommunications, electricity and gas, and
transport, will be opened to competition and their equity capital will be
gradually opened to outside investors. The privatisation programme is far
less ambitious than that of the last right-wing government, estimated by Mr
Edouard Balladur, finance minister of the time, at FFr140bn; a reflection of
the fact that today's stock market conditions are poorer.
On the domestic economy, the manifesto promises a job creation drive,
through a 'pact for jobs' between companies and regions to boost training
and recruitment, to be rewarded by lower social security and other charges.
In addition, tax breaks are on offer for small businesses. Taxes overall
must come down, especially for the middle classes, one-man businesses and to
help research and training, it says.
It promises tax and other incentives - including a large public works
programme - for construction and housing.
On the government's finances, the UPF plans to reduce the budget deficit -
officially estimated at FFr184bn last year - by FFr110bn over the next three
years, according to Mr Alain Juppe, the RPR's secretary general. Of this,
FFr30bn to FFr40bn would come from spending cuts, FFr15bn from the impact of
growth on tax revenue, and the rest from privatisations.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Portuguese telecoms company to cut its workforce by 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TELECOM Portugal, one of the country's three telecommunications operators,
plans to cut its workforce by 20 per cent by the end of 1994.
The shedding of more than 2,000 of Telecom's 11,000 employees is part of a
plan to restructure the company to take account of the European Community
single market and in preparation for at least partial privatisation, company
sources said.
Management will encourage workers to leave through early retirement and
voluntary, rather than forced, redundancies. The move follows 1,500 job
losses at Telecom last year.
The measure will include streamlining the five-member board - one of the
proposals made in a study by consultants MAC-Group. Telecom currently has
accumulated loses of Es150bn (Pounds 698m) and assets of Es400bn. Tariffs
will be raised 5.5 per cent later this year. The inflation rate is expected
to reach 7 per cent.
Telecom was recently hived off from Correios e Telecomunicacions de
Portugal, which will remain the public postal service. Telecom and the two
other telephone operators, Telefones de Lisboa e Porto and Marconi, will be
brought together as three separate divisions of a holding company,
Comunicacoes Nacionais.
The Telecommunications Ministry wants to privatise the companies gradually
to give Portuguese investors time to pay and keep the country's
telecommunications out of foreign hands.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Hurd warns of showdown with Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, DAVID GARDNER and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government threw down the gauntlet to Conservative Euro-sceptics and the
opposition parties yesterday by insisting it would rather sink the
Maastricht treaty outright than accept British adherence to the social
chapter.
But as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, issued the warning, Lord
Tebbit, a former party chairman, urged Tory MPs to defy the leadership and
vote for a Labour amendment on the social chapter - expressly in order to
destroy the treaty.
In a vituperative speech to political journalists, the arch Euro-sceptic
argued that support for the amendment would not lead to its imposition. He
said: 'Those who are fighting to preserve self-government for Britain are
well entitled to use every procedural device to destroy the treaty'.
Lord Tebbit's intervention provoked an outcry from government loyalists and
put the anti-Maastricht faction on the defensive.
Sir Teddy Taylor, a leading opponent of the treaty, described it as
unhelpful, but added: 'There is no way we are going to co-operate in the
treaty going through if we don't get a referendum.'
The latest outbreak of internecine warfare within the Tory ranks came as Mr
Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, joined the fray by
implicitly criticising the UK with his most stinging attack yet on the
'renationalisation' of economic policy in the EC.
In a Strasbourg speech presenting the Commission's programme for 1993-94, he
said competitive devaluations were jeopardising plans for economic and
monetary union and 'the very idea of a united Europe'.
Mr Delors also warned that Brussels would 'take up the cudgels again' to get
controversial items from the EC's Social Charter into Community law - a move
that will confirm the worst fears of British Conservatives.
The government's decision to raise the stakes over the vote - in spite of
commanding only a narrow 21-vote overall majority - came after careful
consultation between Mr Hurd and Mr John Major, the prime minister.
In a BBC radio interview, the foreign secretary called on Conservative MPs
to take note that: 'We are not going to join a treaty which imposes the
social chapter.'
Downing Street insisted that the prime minister was confident the party
would support the government in the Commons' vote, expected in about six
weeks. But a senior official stressed that there was no possibility of
Britain returning to treaty negotiations with its European Community
partners if the amendment was passed.
'The politics of this is that once you open up this can of worms everything
comes out. We can only ratify the treaty that we negotiated. If it is not
ratified by all 12, the treaty does not come into being,' he said.
In fact, a defeat for the government on Labour's amendment would not
necessarily halt the ratification process. The government would have
opportunities both in the House of Lords and at the Commons report stage to
reverse it.
Privately, Labour acknowledged it had little chance of imposing the social
chapter on the government, but every effort would be made to maximise the
Conservatives' discomfiture.

FT  11 FEB 93 / New rescue plan for threatened pits: Draft white paper would
avoid legislation - MPs' recommendations sidestepped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRAFT white paper on the future of Britain's threatened coal industry
has passed over most of the main recommendations of the Commons trade and
industry committee in favour of an alternative plan to expand the market
without new legislation.
The government hopes its four-pronged approach will create an extra market
of, on average, about 12m tonnes a year for domestic deep-mined coal. This
could be higher in the first year and the package would save about a dozen
of the 31 mines threatened with closure.
The plan would also pave the way for the government to press ahead with
privatisation of the industry next year.
The draft under discussion envisages expanding the market for deep-mined
coal by:
blocking imports of orimulsion - a bitumen-based fuel;
slowing the planned rundown of coal stocks;
cutting output from open-cast mines;
using subsidies to halt growth in coal imports.
The draft avoids the committee's more radical proposals - halting purchases
of nuclear-generated electricity from France, cutting the Pounds 1.2bn
domestic nuclear levy and postponing electricity market liberalisation. All
these measures would require legislation.
The committee's recommendations would result in an additional market of at
least 16m tonnes a year, implying more than half the threatened pits could
be rescued. In an unusual move, Mr Richard Caborn, the committee's Labour
chairman, plans to tell a press conference today that its proposals could be
implemented for much less than the Pounds 500m originally stated.
A recent FT survey of the Conservative MPs most likely to rebel over coal
indicated that proposals to save between 12 and 14 pits would safeguard the
government's Commons majority. But the rescue plan hinges on cajoling
National Power and PowerGen, the main electricity generators for England and
Wales, into signing new five-year coal contracts. These would be over and
above the 40m tonnes next year and 30m tonnes in the subsequent four years
that they have tentatively agreed to buy.
Senior ministers are relying on the combination of a direct Treasury subsidy
and the implicit threat of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into
the power industry to secure a deal.
They want the two generators, in which the government retains a 40 per cent
interest, to sign a 'heads of agreement' by the end of this month.
While ministers acknowledge they are meeting resistance from the generators,
which are not legally obliged to buy any coal, they think the promise of
five years of stability in the industry will persuade them to back down.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has concluded that fresh
legislation would threaten lengthy rows at Westminster and provoke a
backlash from the generators' non-coal suppliers.
He has been advised that the government's plan would not fall foul of the
European Commission or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If
agreement is reached, he will present the package to MPs as a strictly
limited programme to phase out existing coal subsidies, emphasising that
present arrangements for the electricity market involve an implicit subsidy
for coal of around Pounds 1bn a year.
This would be reduced to Pounds 350m or less next year and to nothing by
1998.
Spreading the rundown of stocks over five years rather than the expected two
would have the most significant early impact, making room for more than 6.5m
tonnes of additional consumption in both 1993-94 and 1994-95.
Pegging coal imports at current levels and effectively banning orimulsion
could each expand the annual market for domestic deep-mined coal by 3m
tonnes by 1995-96. Cutting open-cast output to 10m tonnes a year could in
time lift demand by a further 4m tonnes.
But excessive coal stocks and the availability of cheap imports have helped
to strengthen the generators' bargaining position: they could in theory
avoid buying any British coal at all in 1993-94, as the select committee
report acknowledged.
Michael Smith adds: Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, last night
expressed strong reservations about the white paper's expected contents,
saying failure to postpone electricity market liberalisation would leave
British Coal 'prey to the market power of its principal customers'.

FT  11 FEB 93 / OFT reviews UK stock market rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Office of Fair Trading is investigating London stock exchange rules
which have helped to centralise share trading on the UK's official stock
market.
The rules guarantee that the exchange's share prices are always the best
available on any electronic price system, encouraging investors to use the
official market rather than trading outside the exchange.
Unusually among leading international markets, the London exchange controls
almost all the turnover of shares in the companies it lists. The New York
stock exchange has seen trading seep away to rival trading systems in recent
years, while the leading European bourses have lost business to London.
The Securities and Futures Authority, the UK regulatory body, says less than
5 per cent of turnover in UK companies' shares takes place outside the
exchange.
The exchange's rules 335 and 362 forbid brokers and dealers from quoting
better prices on any other electronic trading system than the ones they
quote on the exchange's own system. The regulations cover both the domestic
stock market, prices for which are carried on Seaq (the Stock Exchange
Automatic Quotation system), and the international share market which has
grown up rapidly in London in recent years on the back of the international
Seaq service.
The rules were adopted at the time of Big Bang in 1986, when share trading
moved off the exchange's floor to be replaced by a telephone market
supported by the price quotation system.
The OFT said it was looking at the regulation, along with other exchange
rules. It added the investigation was in its early stages, and that it was
still gathering information on the effect of the regulation.
The exchange said: 'We're not aware of any investigation by the OFT, or of
any complaints about our rules.' The competition authorities have fought a
running battle over the exchange's rulebook in recent years, concerned that
vestiges of the old exchange cartel have survived the deregulation of the
mid-1980s.
A number of rivals want to challenge the exchange's dominance of London
trading. Tradepoint Financial Networks, a system headed by Mr Stanley Ross,
one of the founding figures of the Eurobond market, last week completed
efforts to raise Dollars 11m and plans to launch later this year. Instinet,
the Reuters subsidiary which has taken a substantial share of US share
trading, has also tried to break into London.

FT  11 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons in the bid frame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKEOVER speculation over Fisons increased yesterday, partly as a result of
heavy trading in the derivatives market by Morgan Stanley, the US investment
bank and securities house. The whole drugs sector was in favour again,
rebounding from its recent poor performance on the belief that losses
related to US healthcare reforms had been overdone. However, Fisons ended
the day, against the overall market trend, as one of the strongest
performers in the FT-SE Index of London's 100 most highly valued stocks.
Rumours have circulated around the company for some time but speculation has
increased over the past few days. One bearish analyst said yesterday: 'The
company is an obvious takeover target because the management has lost
credibility.' Hanson, French group Rhone Poulenc, and ICI's soon to be
demerged pharmaceuticals arm Zeneca, were cited as companies that might be
interested in making an offer. Fisons shares avoided the malaise in the
market on Tuesday and yesterday the shares added 10 at 246p. Turnover of
5.8m was at the high end of average volumes and was further boosted by the
equivalent of another 2.5m shares in the options market.
Insurers troubled
The well-flagged Pounds 428m rights issue by Commercial Union caused no real
problems for the shares, which bounced after an initial markdown by dealers
and a brief flurry of selling. But it troubled other composites as the
market focused on the next potential group to raise equity capital.
CU shares dropped to 580p following the cash call news before stabilising
and staging a strong upward push to close 12 higher at 610p. Mr Trevor May,
insurance analyst at BZW, said the market's support reflected the company's
'proven track record' but cautioned that the shares were 'fully valued'.
Other specialists were more enthusiastic. Mr Youssef Ziai, at Morgan
Stanley, said worries about a cash call had acted as a brake on the shares
and he now expected a period of outperformance.
Switching out of General Accident to take up the CU 'rights' and worries
that GA may be the next insurer to raise capital saw the former's shares 26
weaker at 569p. It was pointed out that GA followed CU in raising capital
via preference issues last year. Guardian Royal eased 3 to 167p but was not
seen as likely to launch any fund-raising short term. Nor was Royal, 4
better at 273p.
Reuters hit
News and information group Reuters Holdings dropped sharply on selling from
the US following the company's results statement on Tuesday, as well as some
disillusionment among UK investors.
Reuters shares were below 1200p at one stage and closed a net 66 lower at
1316p on active turnover of 3.4m, the highest for almost a year. The slide
was prompted principally by a fall of Dollars 3 7/8 in the American
Depositary Receipts on Wall Street ahead of a results presentation for US
analysts.
In addition, agency broker James Capel reiterated its sell recommendation,
arguing that the stock was over-rated and needed to fall another 100p before
reaching a justifiable level.
A barrage of sell recommendations unsettled the oil majors, where BP dipped
5 to 266p and Shell 7 to 588p.
Mr Jeremy Hudson, oil analyst at Lehman Brothers, described both stocks as
trading sells ahead of this weekend's Opec meeting. He said BP has risen 46
per cent since the dividend cut last August and had outperformed the FT
All-Share Index by 11 per cent during the last month.
'There is very little room for disappointment at the Opec meeting or for any
reversal of the pound against the dollar,' said Mr Hudson, who added that
current valuations now appear to discount most of the strong 1994 earnings
recovery prospects. NatWest Securities adopted a bearish stance on Shell,
citing 'awful margins in refining and chemicals'.
There was no let-up in takeover speculation surrounding the bank sector,
with old favourites Standard Chartered and TSB both sharply higher on
stories that Lloyds Bank could be about to embark on a big bid.
Lloyds is scheduled to announce preliminary results tomorrow. TSB closed 8
1/2 up at 171p on heavy turnover of 9.6m shares but remained well below the
179p all-time peak they achieved at the start of last week when the latest
spate of rumours first emerged.
Standard Chartered, due to report 1992 profits well ahead of last year's
Pounds 205m on March 10, jumped 21 to 631p. Lloyds held at 515p.
Trafalgar House gained 2 at 86 1/2 p on talk that an expected cash call
would be in the form of convertible stock issued to shareholders and amount
to between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m.
Cadbury-Schweppes rose 6 to 467p on talk of a positive note and upgrade by
SG Warburg. While moving its figures from the bottom to mid-range in the
market, Warburg was seemingly pointing up Cadbury's currency attractions and
the fading need for a rights issue as a result.
Selected food retailers bounced after the recent pounding on the back of VAT
fears. Argyll Group firmed 6 to 367p, Kwik Save 7 to 802p and Tesco 5 to
239p. J. Sainsbury missed the party, the shares being under a shadow from a
line of unplaced stock. They closed steady at 529p. However, Albert Fisher
managed to place its overhang and the stock rose 3 to 69p. Turnover was a
large 11m.
Bid talk around Alexon refused to die, the shares adding a penny at 82p.
Boots shed 4 to 486p on worries over NHS prescription costs. Kingfisher fell
10 to 516p on concern over the rights issue to fund its supposed purchase of
Darty, the French electrical retailer. Storehouse confirmed the departure of
its chief executive and it lost 10 to 184p.
ICI fell 26 to 1145p after investors sold heavily in the US on Tuesday
night. There was also growing concern that actual and expected rights
issues, combined with the UK government's heavy gilts programme, would drain
money from the market and cast doubt over any ICI fund-raising exercise. If
ICI is unable to raise money after its results on February 25, some analysts
are doubtful over the likelihood of the proposed split between the chemicals
and pharmaceuticals arms going ahead.
BOC firmed 3 to 739p ahead of figures today. The market is looking for a
first quarter profit of about Pounds 89m.
Shares in Simon Engineering tumbled after the company revealed a Pounds 5m
contract loss. The news prompted analysts to reduce profits forecasts and
the shares fell 20 to 119p.
Bid talk in Vickers gathered momentum and the shares jumped 8 to 132p.
Industrial group Charter Consolidated, which sold its stake in Johnson
Matthey on Tuesday, was once again mentioned as a likely predator. Charter
shares were a penny easier at 655p while those of Johnson fell 5 to 468p.
Late selling of Lucas Industries saw the shares give up 6 to 139p in trade
of 3.3m. The company has been seeing analysts and some said trading
conditions in the automotive division are worse than expected, although this
might be offset by tough cost-cutting plans.
Heavy two-way business persisted for a third day in Forte, with dealers
saying that buying led by James Capel was being met by bears in the market
still convinced that the dividend may be at risk. After gaining against the
market trend, the shares lost 4 to 186p in heavy turnover of about 8m.
French press talk persisted over changes being planned by Walt Disney
management to their arrangement with Euro Disney which would be beneficial
to the latter's shareholders. The shares surged, but later retreated to
close just 2 ahead at 915p.
Rights issue talk pervaded the drinks stocks, with the usual favourite,
Allied Lyons, being joined by Grand Metropolitan. According to market
gossip, GrandMet was casting around to make a Pounds 200m-plus call in order
to finance debt and a possible acquisition. Its shares weakened 7 to 437p,
with Allied 3 off at 586p.
Market rumours ahead of the latest consultation from Ofwat, the water
regulatory authority, proved wide of the mark. The paper, released
yesterday, said that Ofwat would 'look carefully' at the way growth is
financed.

FT  11 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices continue to give ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BID speculation provided the few firm features yesterday in a UK stock
market where caution on the near-term outlook still prevailed. The latest of
the expected flow of rights issues - a call for Pounds 428m from Commercial
Union and a very small fund-raising from Stonehill - were taken comfortably
but the conglomerates sector was on alert for a convertible issue this
morning.
Investors now face a heavy run of trading statements from the leading names
of British industry, beginning today with British Petroleum, BT and BOC
Group.
Equities opened lower but rallied well until one UK house began to sell the
March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index which quickly collapsed to a discount
against the underlying stock market.
Share prices quickly followed suit as the securities house unloaded blue
chip stocks. The pace was set by a sharp fall in Reuters in London after the
shares had been hit hard on Wall Street overnight.
At worst, the Footsie was more than 21 points off with London looking
nervous as New York opened lower. But the initial fall on the Dow Industrial
Average was trimmed to 2.97 in UK hours, and late weakness in sterling was
again interpreted as good for Britain's export stocks while not inhibiting
chances of a base rate cut in the Budget in March.
The FT-SE 100 closed at 2,816.4, a net 14.9 down, with the 2,800 mark still
unchallenged, at least for the time being. Profit-taking spread across the
range of the stock market and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index weakened 17.9 to
3,001.9.
Seaq volume slipped to 616.1m shares from the 694.8m recorded in the
previous session; Tuesday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.58bn, in the
higher range of recent daily averages.
The renewed weakness in the pound is working to the benefit of share prices
in London, according to Mr Marcus Grubb at Salomon Brothers. He also
believes that the Bundesbank will ease policy in the face of a slowing
economy in Germany. The setback in sterling which followed the currency's
exit from the ERM network provided a mirror image of the rise in the UK
stock market between September and December last year.
The mood in equities appeared less negative yesterday than on Tuesday, and
the overall picture was more irregular than the fall in the Footsie might
suggest. Oil shares, which have been very firm for some days, encountered
cautious profit-taking as the sector braced itself for trading figures today
from BP. Food retailers, casualties in the recent selling bout, found
buyers.
Bank stocks were firmer but the impetus here came from speculative activity
rather than from views on the trading experiences likely to be revealed very
shortly by the big UK houses. Suggestions of bid moves against some of the
weaker names in the financial sector have been heard before and traders saw
no new factors this time.
The relatively favourable reception for the rights issue from Commercial
Union still left share prices vulnerable to further fund-raising moves. Some
analysts, however, believe that, at present interest rate levels, corporate
finance directors may be looking at the bond and convertible bond markets
rather than at equities as venues for fund-raising.

FT  11 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE RIGHTS issue fears, coupled with a general lack of buying interest, led
to a lacklustre day in derivatives yesterday, writes Joel Kibazo.
The early announcement of a cash call from Commercial Union was at first
poorly received and the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened weakly
at 2,823.
However, the view that the funds were to be put to good use helped to steady
nerves and the March contract shrugged off the early gloom to move into
positive territory on sporadic buying, mainly from independent traders.
That positive mood received a sharp knock when a leading securities house
moved to sell the contract. March fell sharply and was soon trading at a
discount to the underlying cash market, which had followed it down.
With a dull Wall Street and few buyers, March fell to a day's low of 2,808
at 2.50pm. But a feeling that the contract's fall had been overdone,
together with general short-covering, helped it rally in the last half-hour
of trading.
March finished at 2,827, down 6 from the previous close and at a premium of
12 to cash. Turnover fell to 9,918 lots.
In traded options, a total of 30,523 contracts had been dealt by the close,
with some 7,616 lots transacted in the FT-SE 100 option. Tesco was the most
active stock option with volume of 2,733 contracts.

FT  11 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Pharmaceuticals begin to lose their
glamour - Paul Abrahams highlights the US/UK switch into cyclicals, and
reservations about European growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceutical stocks, a salve for market woes for much of the recession,
have started to wobble.
Most British and American drugs stocks have been caught as investors switch
out of defensive companies into cyclical recovery plays - groups which have
suffered during the slowdown in the world economy, but are likely to post
significant earnings increases once it begins to pick up.
European drug groups have also suffered, because the ability of some
companies to continue to churn out double-digit earnings growth is becoming
increasingly questionable. The operating environment for healthcare stocks
is changing fast, and changing for the worse.
The main problem facing the sector is the issue of pricing. Governments
around the globe, faced by rapidly growing healthcare spending, are turning
their attention to the apparently excessive profits of the drugs groups.
The governments' response has been to limit demand for medicines or cut
prices. The Japanese and German markets, the world's second and third
largest respectively, both endured price cuts last year.
In the US, legislation against groups which increase prices above the rate
of inflation is also being threatened by the Clinton administration.
The effect on the pharmaceuticals market has been a divergence between
companies which, in the past, have driven earnings up with volume growth,
and those which have produced it with price increases - and will no longer
be able to do so.
The most outstanding European drugs stock over the last six months has been
the Swedish group Astra.
The company is small compared with Anglo-American industry giants but,
nevertheless, it is the world's fastest-growing drugs group. It has
outperformed its local market by 35 per cent over the last six months,
rising from a low of SKr484 in August to close yesterday at SKr677 in the
'B' shares.
Astra's volume growth has been outstanding in all of its three main
therapeutic areas, gastrointestinal, respiratory and cardiovascular. It is
also one of the few pure pharmaceuticals plays on the European continent.
During the first nine months of last year, sales of Losec, its anti-ulcer
treatment, increased by 41 per cent to SKr5bn, while those for Pulmicort,
its asthma treatment, rose 59 per cent to SKr1.347bn.
The group is predicting a sales increase of up to 25 per cent for the full
year, an impressive achievement. James Capel estimates that, during 1991,
only 15 per cent of Astra's growth in the US was owed to price increases.
The other outstanding stock has been Roche, the Swiss concern, which has
outperformed its local market by about 10 per cent since July. Roche, one of
Switzerland's three chemicals giants, is the least exposed to cyclical
non-drug operations.
Similar to Astra, Roche is generating growth by increasing sales, rather
than prices. With a wide portfolio of relatively small products in terms of
sales, its drugs division increased its turnover last year by 16 per cent to
SFr6.9bn.
The other Swiss groups have not performed so well. Sandoz has only tracked
its domestic market over the last six months. The problem is that Sandoz's
pharmaceuticals and nutrition divisions have been held back by the remainder
of the group.
Through its construction and chemical activities, the company has been
exposed to recession. In addition, its agrochemicals division has also been
hit by last year's reform of the European Community's common agricultural
policy.
Ciba-Geigy, its Basle neighbour, is the world's largest agrochemical group
and has also suffered from the downturn in the world economy.
Although Ciba-Geigy's pharmaceuticals sales have been growing fast, thanks
partly to the group's highly successful US launch of its nicotine patch, its
speciality chemicals operations have suffered from the general economic
downturn.
James Capel estimates that 20 per cent of group operating profits are
cyclical, compared with 8 per cent of Roche's.
Ciba-Geigy's shares have underperformed the local market by 10 per cent
since July. In particular, the group has suffered from heavy selling of its
American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in the US.
Meanwhile, analysts are also tipping Novo Nordisk because of its volume
sales increases. James Capel estimates that only 5 per cent of the Danish
company's operating profits are cyclical. The healthcare business is
expected to produce double-digit sales growth, as its insulin and hormone
replacement therapies continue to do well.
It may also receive a boost from Seroxat, its anti-depressant which has just
been launched in the US by SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American company.
Big chemical groups with pharmaceuticals divisions, such as Bayer, in
Germany, and Akzo, of the Netherlands, have suffered from their
vulnerability to economic cycles. However, investors may well be looking to
pick up their shares as recovery plays. As usual, timing will be crucial.

FT  11 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firmer ahead of
options settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ROUND of small-lot buying at the end of the session lifted share prices,
and the Nikkei average closed moderately higher amid quiet pre-holiday
trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 67.73 at 17,089.90, having fallen to the day's
low of 16,897.86 in the morning session. It recovered towards the close and
hit the day's high of 17,092.00.
Volume was little changed at 190m shares against 186m. Activity centred on
position adjustment and technical trading by dealers and arbitrageurs ahead
of Friday's options settlements. Declines, however, retained a small lead
over rises at the close by 474 to 436, with 198 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks lost a net 0.17 at 1,295.93, and in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.38 to 1,044.19.
Most investors remained absent ahead of today's national holiday. The sharp
rise in the yen against the dollar also unnerved some investors, while the
weekend meeting between Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, and Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, US treasury secretary, was also focusing attention.
Traders said prices moved forward just before the close in technical trading
linked to options activity. The settlement price for February options
contracts will be fixed on Friday morning.
Export-oriented high technology issues lost ground on the higher yen.
Fujitsu retreated Y20 to Y537, while Sony fell Y60 to Y4,080 and TDK, the
tape maker, lost Y120 to Y3,370.
Speculative trading by dealers also led activity. Gajoen Kanko, the ailing
hotel and restaurant operator, advanced Y25 to Y265 and Nagase moved ahead
Y45 to Y830.
Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, rose Y6 to Y380 on the
'restructuring theme', while Nissan Chemical appreciated Y8 to Y758.
Non-ferrous metal producers eased on falling gold prices. Sumitomo Metal
Mining lost Y1 to Y649 and Mitsubishi Materials Y2 to Y407.
Housing-related stocks advanced on reports of strong condominium sales in
January. Daikyo, the leading condominium developer, rose Y29 to Y824 and
Mitsui Home gained Y50 to Y1,570 on the second section.
Some oil refiners were firmer on prospects of lower oil import prices due to
the higher yen: Showa Shell Sekiyu put on Y30 at Y1,490. Arabian Oil climbed
Y50 to Y3,700 on reports that a consortium, including the company, had
started an oil development project off the Vietnamese coast.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 22.18 to 18,474.38 in volume of 52.4m
shares.
Roundup
POLITICAL considerations came to the fore in some Pacific Rim markets.
AUSTRALIAN shares were mostly firmer as the market took a lead from better
than expected half-year results from Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The All
Ordinaries index added 7.2 at 1,591.1 in turnover that slowed to ADollars
153m.
Shares in Commonwealth Bank, in which the government has a 70 per cent
stake, were 23 cents higher at ADollars 6.20.
HONG KONG began quietly, again inhibited by the political outlook, but a
late burst of buying, particularly of banking shares, helped the Hang Seng
index finish 46.03 stronger at 5,835.55 in turnover of HKDollars 1.9bn.
TAIWAN made a strong start but succumbed to heavy profit-taking in reaction
to news that Provincial Governor Lien Chan was being nominated as premier.
The weighted index, more than 80 points higher at mid-morning, ended a net
58.93 down at 3,578.10.
BANGKOK was led higher by demand for bank shares and the SET index gained
17.45, or 1.8 per cent, at 990.13.
BOMBAY rose for the third consecutive session, with speculative buying
taking the BSE index up 40.44 to 2,812.12.

FT  11 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan eases after resignation
of justice minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE and political news dominated trading yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
MILAN turned lower late in the day as Justice Minister Claudio Martelli  - a
member of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato's Socialist party - resigned after
being told he was under investigation on corruption charges.
The Comit index ended down 3.53 at 496.15 and Italian shares quoted on the
Seaq system in London continued subsequently to trade lower.
The bourse had unexpectedly overcome a weak start to trade higher for much
of the afternoon session. However, analysts expect that the ever-widening
political scandal, together with technical account-end considerations, will
make for a choppy ride for the remainder of the week.
Strong overseas demand for Stet took the telecommunications holding company
L23 higher to fix at L2,283, before L2,285 after hours.
But Fondiaria, which announced a board reshuffle, dipped L192 to L29,008
before easing to L28,973 in late trade.
FRANKFURT saw a battle between bulls and bears produce a surge in market
turnover. The DAX index closed just 8.23 higher at 1,649.81, off an intraday
high of 1,656.83, and the indications were that some of the remaining gains
were being dissipated in after hours trading. Turnover rose to DM8.2bn from
DM5.8bn.
Banks fell again after last week's gains, BHF losing DM5 to DM440 on news of
a rights issue. Chemicals were relatively weak on average, Bayer adding a
mere 10 pfg to DM257.70 as it detailed a cut in staff bonus payments.
The main winners were carmakers, where Daimler rose DM11 to DM614, and
electricals with AEG up DM5.40 to DM168.90 and Siemens DM7.50 better at
DM638.50. Dealers said that the main reason for the gains, with fund
managers, especially foreigners, underweight in German shares, seemed to
have operated irrespective of the depressing fundamentals for the car
sector.
PARIS sold Michelin after the tyre group reported a fall in 1992 second half
sales. While the figures only confirmed the depressed state of the sector
the shares dipped FFr8.90 or 4.5 per cent to FFr187.40. The CAC-40 index,
which had seen a day's high of 1,899, closed barely changed, down 0.73 at
1,893.32. Turnover was FFr2.6bn.
UAP was another faller, down FFr10 at FFr520, after releasing disappointing
1992 earnings after Tuesday's close.
Schneider gained FFr11 to FFr666 on news that it was to sell a subsidiary in
an effort to reduce debt.
AMSTERDAM was interested in cyclicals while Fokker, which denied reports
that credit lines had been suspended, fell to the day's low of Fl 8.40
before recovering slightly to close down Fl 1.00 at Fl 9.40. The CBS
Tendency index was unchanged at 97.9 after a high of 98.5.
BRUSSELS was flat after a day of heavy and hectic trade as the market
focused on further pressures on the Belgian franc and a subsequent interest
rate rise. The Bel-20 index finished virtually unchanged, losing 0.09 to
1,213.85 in high volume of BFr1.71bn.
Electrabel lost BFr170 or 2.9 per cent to BFr5,720, but among
dollar-oriented shares, Petrofina gained BFr170 or 2.3 per cent to BFr7,670.
MADRID was active in Banesto prior to the bank announcing that it had
reached agreement for a US investment group to take a minority stake. The
shares saw a high of Pta2,545 before closing Pta70 higher at Pta2,435. The
general index eased 0.77 to 234.26 in turnover of Pta18.6bn.
ZURICH was easier in quiet conditions that left the SMI index 14.9 lower at
2,120.8.
STOCKHOLM was encouraged by hopes of lower interest rates while Ericsson
remained a favourite following the release of good 1992 results on Tuesday.
Its B shares closed up SKr11 at SKr220 in high volume. The Affarsvarlden
index gained 15.6 to 964.5 in turnover of SKr1.5bn.
OSLO remained active with the all-share index gaining 4.76 or 1.2 per cent
to 406.62 in turnover of NKr509.1m. HELSINKI extended its gains as investors
anticipated a number of company results, and the HEX index rose 15.4 to
926.4.
ISTANBUL broke through the 5,000 level in early trading before retreating on
profit-taking. The 75-share index closed down 28.98 to 4,943.40 in turnover
of TL500bn.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Repo is disappointing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED Euromark futures fell back yesterday after the Bundesbank
reduced the lowest accepted rate in its weekly securities repurchase tender
by only 7 basis points, writes James Blitz.
Hopes of a substantial cut in the rate at which the Bundesbank offers funds
to commercial banks had been dashed at the weekend after Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the central bank's president, indicated that last week's
reduction in Germany's officially posted interest rates would not mean a
lowering in the cost of money market funds. However, there was still some
disappointment when the lowest accepted repo rate came in at 8.50 per cent,
from last week's 8.57 per cent.
The March Euromark contract declined by 4 basis points from its previous
close, finishing at 91.97. At this level it prices three-month money next
month at 8.03 per cent. Call money was virtually unaltered yesterday at 8.60
per cent.
The duller tone continued to take its toll on French franc markets. The cost
of three-month cash hovered around 12 per cent, while the March French franc
contract closed 30 basis points down on the day at 88.57. At this level it
assumes that three-month money will come down only 50 basis points between
now and the French elections.
There was little activity in sterling markets. The March futures contract
rose 6 basis points to close at 94.16, while three-month money was unchanged
at 6 3/16 per cent.
One dealer suggested yesterday that the March contract was a very good buy
from here. He listed several events which could raise expectations of a cut
in UK base rates in the next two months.
These include two Bundesbank meetings, and a further one on the day after
the March contract expires; a G7 finance ministers' meeting in London on
February 27, which may discuss the high level of European interest rates;
and the UK Budget on March 16.
Convergence of the March contract with the current level of three-month
money could, of course, bring the March future down to around 93.75.
Devel-oping problems over the Maastricht treaty could also undermine the
pound on the foreign exchanges.
However, if sterling stabilises at its current level, there may be reasons
to buy the contract now.

LME COPPER prices were depressed by Tuesday's unconvincing chart close, and
eased back under stale bull liquidation. News that Polish copper miners had
called off a strike alert underlined bearish sentiment. ZINC fell below
important support around Dollars 1,110 for three-month metal, undermined by
the absence of further production cut news. ALUMINIUM went into reverse
after news of an unexpected 17,000 tonne rise in December IPAI producer
stocks. Also, there is heavy technical resistance above Dollars 1,240 for
three-month metal. NICKEL eased under technical liquidation, lacking
follow-through to recent investment fund interest. But prices held stable
around the lows. Robusta COFFEE futures finished with gains of Dollars 17 to
Dollars 25 a tonne on key positions, but were below the day's highs as the
market continued to be highly volatile. Dealers said technical factors
remained dominant. Conditions remained very nervous and the threat of a
resumed downtrend remained.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gatt to set up banana row panel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICAN banana producers yesterday stepped up their fight against the
European Community's present and future banana import policies within the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The body's governing council agreed to set up an independent disputes panel
to examine whether the existing restraints on imports of 'dollar' bananas
operated by five EC member states breach international trade rules. The
panel will report by the beginning of May, under expedited procedures
following the breakdown of talks under the 'good offices' of Mr Arthur
Dunkel, the Gatt director-general.
Meanwhile, the five banana producers involved - Colombia, Costa Rica,
Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela - have served notice that they will mount
a challenge in Gatt against proposals for an EC-wide banana import regime,
which are due to come into force on July 1. They claim the measures will
cost them Dollars 1bn in lost export earnings over the next two years.
The proposals, approved by EC ministers last December but still to be
confirmed, would impose a prohibitive tariff on imports of dollar bananas
beyond a 2m tonne quota while allowing unrestricted duty-free imports from
higher-cost Caribbean suppliers with EC treaty ties. Latin American banana
exports to the EC have expanded rapidly to about 2.6m tonnes in 1992.
By the time the report of the panel set up yesterday has been adopted by the
Gatt council the new Community rules may have already superseded the
patchwork of restrictions now operated by Britain, France, Spain, Portugal
and Greece. But the Latin American producers believe that a May panel
verdict in their favour would help clear a legal pathway for a similar
verdict later on the new measures. These, they allege, violate existing Gatt
obligations, run counter to draft rules on farm trade under negotiation in
the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, and threaten them with economic
devastation.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium flood rings alarm
bells in CIS - As exports have soared shortages have appeared at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KARL WOBBE admits he seriously underestimated the ability of the Russian
aluminium industry to keep production going against all the odds. 'At the
begining of 1992 I thought their industry would collapse because of raw
materials shortages,' he recalls. Instead, the smelters in the Commonwealth
of Independent States are estimated to have produced about 3.1m tonnes of
the metal last year, close to the industry's capacity of between 3.5m and
3.6m tonnes.
Much of that aluminium poured into western Europe, the nearest big consuming
market, where it was paid for in currencies much more stable and desirable
than the rouble.
That produced shortages in the CIS itself, even though the chaotic
conditions there cut demand for aluminium substantially. For example, fish
canning industries in Russia and the Ukraine were particularly vocal about
aluminium shortages - among other things, the metal is used for canning
caviar.
So both the European industry and the CIS authorities have good cause for
concern about the continuing high level of aluminium exports.
Mr Wobbe, management board director responsible for aluminium production at
VAW of Germany, says that during a recent visit to the CIS: 'We got the
feeling that the Russian aluminium industry wants to contact the European
industry to find ways of improving the situation. They understand that most
(west European) smelters are not making money. I feel they are now more
willing to take part in discussions'.
The question remains, however, who will do the talking for the CIS industry?
There is a great struggle going on about who should have control of the
industry and take important decisions on its behalf. Much of CIS aluminium
production has been controlled for the past two years by Concernalumini but
that organisation now has a tarnished image, having failed to provide the
hoped-for investment for modernisation. Now the power seems to be switching
to a new Russian state organisation: the Committee for Metallurgy. This body
has its own Committee for Aluminium with Mr Gregory Maslov at its head. Mr
Maslov therefore seems likely to emerge as the most powerful individual in
the CIS aluminium industry.
However, the recent turmoil has given individual smelter managers much more
power - simply because they have the metal and the money it produces. And
smelter managers are already at odds with the new state organisation about
the terms for privatising the aluminium industry. They want 51 per cent of
the shares in each smelter to be distributed to employees, 25 per cent to
the local authority and 24 per cent to the state body. Mr Maslov and his
committee want 51 per cent, leaving 25 per cent for local authorities and
only 24 per cent for employees. The Russian parliament will decide this
contentious issue in April.
Meanwhile, Russia has signalled that it wishes to cut aluminium exports by
raising tariffs steeply this year. Compared with tariffs of Ecu50 (Pounds
41) a tonne in place at the end of 1992, the tariff for exports of primary
aluminium has been lifted to Ecu130 a tonne and that for metal used in
barter deals is up to Ecu205. To close a loophole that has allowed large
quantities of metal - not just aluminium - to be exported under the guise of
'scrap', the tariff on aluminium scrap has been bumped up to Ecu460 a tonne.
More aluminium is being shipped out to the US and Asia instead of Europe
but, even though US import duties have been removed and the metal attracts a
6 per cent duty when entering the European Community area, the Russians say
it is still cheaper to deliver to Europe and the London Metal Exchange.
In spite of the Russian efforts, European aluminium producers seem to have
lost patience and are urging the European Commission to take action soon.
Mr Dick Dermer, president of the European Aluminium Association, says that
the market is being seriously distorted by CIS exports, which are
'endangering the viability of the European aluminium industry.
'The European Community primary aluminium industry has for the past two
years been operating at a loss as a direct result of the distortion in the
aluminium market created by the dramatic and unexpected increase in exports
from the CIS since 1990,' he suggests.
His association started monitoring imports at the begining of 1992 and
estimates that 600,000 tonnes of CIS aluminium reached the EC last year, up
from 450,000 tonnes in 1991 and an average of about 82,000 tonnes a year
before 1990.
The European producers say CIS imports have depressed aluminium prices on
the London Metal Exchange - the most widely-used guide to world prices - and
forced the European industry to make expensive production cuts. Europe
accounts for about 25 per cent of world aluminium supply but is making a
disproportionately large sacrifice as the industry cuts back because of low
prices - 80 per cent of the 1.1m tonnes of world capacity that has been shut
down is in Europe.
Mr Dermer says 'the industry has no other option than to demand that the
European Commission installs a transitional period of safeguard measures
with regard to aluminium from the CIS'.
He will give no details but other European executives say the industry wants
the commission to limit CIS imports to 82,000 tonnes a year, the 'normal'
level before the surge in 1990, and it wants those quotas to include
secondary (scrap) metal. Once that protection is in place, the EC
authorities should jointly discuss how CIS producers could be helped 'to
adjust their sales and pricing policy to the market economy rules and
mechanisms,' says Mr Dermer
The EC should help the CIS to stimulate a revival of its domestic aluminium
consumption, to rationalise and modernise existing facilities and to develop
a workable legal system. 'The community's primary aluminium industry is
willing to assist in that process,' he adds.
However, these proposals do not go unchallenged. Mr Tony Bird of the Anthony
Bird Associates consultancy group, suggests that, not only would a quota
system probably be illegal (Russia cannot be accused of dumping because its
production costs are the lowest in the world and it is not selling aluminium
at a higher price in its domestic market than in the west) neither would it
work.
Mr Bird says: 'Aluminium is a commodity. Russian aluminium is almost the
same as anybody else's aluminium. The market for aluminium does not work in
the same way as the market for cars or photocopiers. If it is displaced from
one market, it can flow easily into another. So, if CIS metal is not allowed
to enter the EC, it can instead be sold in a third country, which will then
ship its own metal to the EC to compensate.'
VAW's Mr Wobbe says CIS producers are keen to modernise their smelters but
they want to pay back loans with the aluminium produced and banks are very
reluctant to provide any cash while aluminium prices are as low as they are
today.
VAW is working on a feasibility study for the modernisation of the
Novokuznetsk smelter in Siberia. A new facility would be built alongside the
existing smelter, which would be closed only once the new one was ready.
This would boost output from 180,000 to 250,000 tonnes. The Russians want
VAW to consider similar schemes at other smelters.
Mr Wobbe says the Novokuznetsk feasibility study (which the Russians are
paying for) will be completed in May. 'The problem then is to finance the
project. The smelter is looking for a financial partner. I believe we can
find the finance, but at present aluminium prices of Dollars 1,200 to
Dollars 1,250 a tonne the profit would not be high. A higher aluminium price
would certainly help.
'The (Russian metallurgy) committee understands the effect exports are
having on prices and that's why it wants to strengthen its grip on aluminium
 -and all other raw material industries.'

FT  11 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US farmers seek protection
against Canadian pasta wheat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL grain subsidy war has taken a strange twist with US
farmers pressing for action against Canada's fast-rising share of the US
domestic market for durum wheat.
Several US senators have threatened retaliatory action against Canada after
a bilateral panel set up under the 1989 free trade agreement ruled this week
that pricing methods used by the Canadian Wheat Board were acceptable
pending review by an independent auditor.
Senator Max Baucus of Montana has introduced a Bill that would give
Washington authority to impose special tariffs on Canadian wheat and require
extra paperwork from importers.
US imports of durum from Canada soared to 225,000 tonnes in the final four
months of last year, making it Canada's second biggest customer after India.
Canada exported virtually no durum, which is used mainly for pasta, to the
US before 1990; now it has about a quarter of the market.
The cut-throat price war in offshore markets has made the unsubsidised US
domestic market one of the most lucrative for Canadian exporters.
For example, Washington last year provided a USDollars 40 per tonne bonus
under its Export Enhancement Program for a shipment to Algeria, which has
traditionally been among Canada's biggest durum customers. The Algerians
paid about Dollars 110 per tonne fob, compared with the US domestic price of
Dollars 150.
A Canadian Wheat Board spokesman yesterday ascribed Canada's success in the
US market largely to 'a very good quality product, which mills consistently
from shipment to shipment.' In addition, pasta's fast-growing popularity has
raised per-capita consumption.
The free-trade panel urged the creation of a joint working group to oversee
regular audits of Canadian durum shipments to the US.

Last week's accelerating decline in Australian wool prices went further this
week, with a new low point for the present selling season reached on every
day. The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator was 457 cents a kg.
on February 10, 31 cents or 6% lower than a week before. The lowest point
reached in the previous 1991-92 season was 434 cents a kg. These are
seriously uneconomic prices for most growers and some are withdrawing their
wool at reserve prices of their own, or withdrawing it immediately prior to
the auction.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC banana talks still
deadlocked

EC farm ministers were last night still unable to unblock proposals they
agreed in principle in December to set quotas and tariffs on banana imports
from Latin America, writes David Gardner in Strasbourg.
A blocking minority made up of Germany, Denmark and the Benelux countries
looked set to drag proceedings late into the night. Mr Rene Steichen, EC
farm commissioner was holding firm to the proposals and the March 1 deadline
to endorse them legally. The plan would fix a 2m tonnes quota on Latin
American imports at an Ecu100 (Pounds 82) a tonne duty, with fruit imported
above that level attracting an Ecu850 tariff.
Strong pressure was being brought to bear on the Netherlands and Belgium to
agree the measures, as they had done in December, and the Dutch and Belgian
ministers were understood to be seeking instructions from their governments.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries firm ahead of second tranche of
refunding auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

AFTER modest gains in the morning, US Treasury prices dropped sharply
yesterday afternoon following a disappointing 10-year auction and a worrying
rise in the Commodity Research Bureau index.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/8 at 104
9/16 , yielding 7.243 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was down  1/16 at 100, to yield 4.233 per cent.
After Tuesday's successful three-year note sale, sentiment about the auction
of Dollars 10.75bn in 10-year notes was generally positive during morning
trading. At the start of the week, analysts had worried that the three-years
would be the hardest sell, so having got what was believed would be the
trickiest part of the refunding out of the way, the market bid up prices
confident that the 10-year sale would go smoothly.
However, prices slumped mid-afternoon in the wake of an auction that proved
disappointing and a rise in the CRB index of 21 commodities, a keenly
watched indicator of inflationary trends.
ITALIAN government bonds fell a point as news emerged that Mr Claudio
Martelli, the justice minister, had resigned from the government.
The BTP futures contract fell a point to 95.90 having settled at 96.89 on
Tuesday.
Mr Martelli, a socialist, is under investigation on corruption charges. He
is the first minister to be brought down by the Milan corruption scandal
which broke a year ago.
Dealers said the bond market tumbled on fears that Mr Martelli's resignation
might damage the coalition government.
SPANISH government bonds ended firmer after Tuesday's profit-taking, with
buying interest concentrated on the short end.
Yields fell at yesterday's Treasury bill auction. As expected, the yield on
one-year Treasury bills fell to 12.536 per cent from 13.041 per cent.
THE German government bond market closed firmer, helped by good domestic
buying yesterday. The Liffe bund futures contract rose from 93.18 at the
opening to trade at around 93.35 by late afternoon.
The results of the Bundesbank's keenly watched securities repurchase tender,
announced yesterday, had little effect on the bund market.
The Bundesbank accepted DM62.5bn of bids for 14-day and 28-day securities
repurchase agreements, allocating net new liquidity of DM3.9bn.
The lowest minimum rate at the repo fell 7 basis points to 8.50 per cent.
Dealers said the rates at this week's repo - the first since last Thursday's
cut in the Lombard and discount rates - were in line with expectations.
BELGIAN government bonds saw another volatile day, with prices ending just
above the day's lows in spite of a firmer franc.
The franc started to firm against the D-Mark after the central bank raised a
money market interest rate, the end-of-day rate, from 8.80 per cent to 9.30
per cent.
The Belgian government bond market came under pressure earlier this week on
worries about currency, the political situation and the government's large
borrowing requirement.
UK government bonds closed higher, with the futures market out-performing
cash bonds. The Liffe gilt futures contract gained over half a point, rising
from 100.27 to 101.15. In the cash market, the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002
rose from 111.00 to 111 1/8 by late afternoon.
Dealers said that the market remained concerned about the outlook for
inflation given Tuesday's disappointing producer input prices.
The market is waiting for Friday's retail price index data for January to
see whether there are any signs that inflation has picked up.
FURTHER strengthening of the yen against the US dollar helped to push up
Japanese government bond prices yesterday, but light profit-taking eroded
some of the day's gains leaving the market only slightly higher compared
with its previous close.
The June futures contract, which opened at 109.66, reached a new high of
109.76 as the yen strengthened to 120.68 to the dollar.
However, dealers noted some profit-taking, and the futures contract closed
at 109.53, up from Tuesday's close of 109.50.
In the cash market, the yield on the No 145 traded in a range of 4.21 per
cent to 4.26 per cent, before closing at 4.235 per cent, against Tuesday's
close of 4.245 per cent.
Japanese officials were said to be ready to let the yen strengthen to help
curb Japan's rising trade surplus.
The dollar fell from a high of Y123.93 in Tokyo on Tuesday to a low of
Y120.68 yesterday on expectations that Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister,
and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, would agree to allow the yen to
rise when they meet for the first time in Washington on Saturday.
STANDARD &amp; Poor's has confirmed the AAA rating of the Pounds 180m
securitised issue from Truck Funding, the Leyland Daf finance vehicle,
launched at the end of last year, writes Richard Waters.
The deal was structured to cope with events such as the insolvency of the
manufacturer, S&amp;P said. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, which handled the issue, agreed
to provide a non-recourse facility of up to Pounds 45m to cushion investors
against cash flow problems on the bonds.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Iosco drops common capital
rules plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to create world wide minimum capital rules for securities firms, in
progress for more than three years, were finally abandoned yesterday by
securities regulators from around the world.
The failure to reach agreement means that substantial differences are likely
to persist in the way securities markets around the world are regulated,
leading to a continuing flow of financial market activity to more lightly
regulated financial centres.
The International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), the body
which represents securities regulators in most of the world's financial
centres, decided to abandon efforts to reach common international capital
adequacy rules after the latest meeting of its technical committee, held in
Trinidad.
The search for common capital rules, mirroring the international agreement
on bank capital reached by the Basle group on banking supervision, was
launched by Iosco in the middle of 1989. Only a year ago, the Iosco
technical committee appeared to have reached agreement in principle on a
standard which also met with the approval of international bank regulators.
However, by last autumn, large differences became apparent between the US
Securities and Exchange Commission on the one hand, and a group of
regulators led by the UK Securities and Investments Board on the other. Mr
Richard Breeden, SEC chairman, held out at that stage for higher levels of
capital than were acceptable to financial centres such as London.
A compromise promoted by the chairman of the Hong Kong stock exchange was
rejected yesterday. The US claimed that the proposed capital levels were too
low, while the UK and France maintained they were too high, said Mr Bill
Albrecht, acting chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
who was present at the meeting.

VENEZUELA plans to sell Dollars 600m worth of shares in CANTV, the telephone
company managed by GTE Corporation of the US, by June this year, Reuter
reports from Caracas. The shares represent one third of the state's 49 per
cent stake.
Mr Julian Villalba, president of the Venezuelan Investment Fund, said a
small block of shares would be issued on the Caracas stock exchange to
establish market value and the rest would be placed on foreign stock
exchanges.
In November 1991, a consortium of companies led by GTE paid Dollars 1.88bn
for 40 per cent of CANTV and took managerial control. Another 11 per cent of
shares were sold to employees.
Mr Villalba said the new sale of shares could be made in the US but
officials would look at exchanges in Europe or Asia.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Denmark's Dollars 1bn offering sells
well in spite of tight pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kingdom of Denmark launched its widely-expected Eurodollar bond
yesterday, and syndicate managers expected more new issues today, including
a Ecu500m three-year offering from the European Community.
Mr Andrew Pisker, head of new issues at the lead manager, Lehman Brothers
International, acknowledged that Denmark's Dollars 1bn 5 3/4 per cent
offering due 1998 was aggressively priced to yield 20 basis points over
comparable US Treasuries. However, he reported good sales into Europe and
the UK in spite of the tight spread.
Other syndicate managers said the spread on the Danish deal was five basis
points too tight, but agreed that the issuer had been able to take advantage
of the current demand among investors for dollar-denominated paper. The
syndicate on the Danish deal had not broken by late afternoon.
Mr Niels Sorensen, head of the foreign debt department at Denmark's National
Bank, said he was happy with the cost-advantageous terms of the bond and
that the proceeds had been swapped into floating-rate D-Marks. The funds
will be used to strengthen the central bank's foreign exchange reserves
which have been depleted by the recent intervention to support the Danish
krone within the exchange rate mechanism.
Investor preference for dollar paper enabled the Republic of the Philippines
to increase its previously-announced three-year offering to Dollars 150m
from Dollars 125m and set the yield at 320 basis points above comparable US
Treasuries, at the lower end of the indicated range of 320-330 basis points.
Syndicate managers said the success of the Filipino deal partially reflected
that it had been well flagged in advance of its launch yesterday.
An official at the lead manager, JP Morgan, said that 80 per cent of the
offering was split between Asia and Europe and the remaining 20 per cent was
placed in the US. After the syndicate was broken, the bonds were bid at par,
above their re-offer price of 99.88.
Elsewhere, Credit Local de France raised Pounds 100m of 7 1/4 per cent
Eurobonds due December 12, 1998. The maturity was pitched to tap demand for
paper at that area of the yield curve.
A manager at NatWest Capital Markets, the lead manager, said that a little
over half of the Credit Local paper was placed on the Continent. After the
syndicate broke, the spread widened slightly by one basis point to 46 basis
points above the 7 1/4 per cent UK gilt due in 1998. Syndicate managers said
the bond was generously priced compared with a similar offering from Credit
Foncier de France launched in mid-January with a yield spread of 40 basis
points over comparable UK gilts.
Hambros Bank launched the first New Zealand dollar issue in the
international market since last June. The NZDollars 50m offering for Primary
Industry Bank Australia, due 2000, was more or less sold by midday, mainly
to Benelux, German and Swiss investors.
The issue was bid at 99.55, within the total fees of two points. Further
issues in the New Zealand dollar sector are likely, as some NZDollars 200m
worth of paper is due to mature in the next two months.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Standard Bank to lift payout
after 22% rise

STANDARD Bank, one of South Africa's two largest banking groups, yesterday
announced a 22 per cent increase in attributable income to R625m (Dollars
200m) for 1992 and said it plans to pay a higher dividend.
After taking account of a rights issue, scrip dividends and an acquisition
issue, earnings per share were 17 per cent up at 593 cents. The overall
dividend is going up by 17 per cent to 187 cents per share.
The bank said favourable interest margins and asset growth were the main
reasons for the upturn.
Net interest income rose by 27 per cent to R2.58bn. This reflected improved
margins - the high level of liquidity in the system caused the cost of funds
to drop - and a 21.4 per cent increase in loans, advances and acceptances.
The increased level of advances was the main contributor to the 26.8 per
cent increase in assets, to R63.9bn.
Mr Eddie Theron, managing director, said asset growth was strongest in home
loans, which increased by 49 per cent to R11.9bn.
Standard Bank of South Africa lifted its net income by 31 per cent to R506m
and Standard Merchant Bank increased profit by 21 per cent to R43m.
Bad debts remained at the high level of 1991 and operating costs rose by 29
per cent owing to spending on new foreign operations, staff training,
product development and electronic systems.
Mr Theron said favourable interest margins in 1993 would allow increased
earnings, but at a lower rate than in 1992.
Mr Bob Aldworth, the executive director of ABSA who was sacked earlier this
week, has admitted in an affidavit that he owes the banking group R414,000.
Mr Aldworth had hoped ABSA share options he holds would rise in value
sufficiently to allow him to repay the debt. This has not taken place.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Commonwealth Bank climbs 5% on
lower write-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMONWEALTH Bank of Australia yesterday reported a 5 per cent improvement
in operating profits for the six months ended December, confirming that it
has managed to steer clear of the worst of the problems besetting some of
Australia's big banks.
The bank, 70 per cent owned by the Federal government, is holding the
interim dividend steady at 20 cents a share after an increase in operating
profit from ADollars 225.1m to ADollars 236.4m (USDollars 158.2m) for the
six months.
In contrast to rivals like Westpac and the ANZ Bank, Commonwealth got
through the six months with reduced bad debt write-offs, no property
provisions and slightly lower problem loans on its books.
The bank reduced its charge against profit for bad and doubtful debts by
14.5 per cent to ADollars 346.5m while gross non-accrual loans carried eased
by 1 per cent to ADollars 3.69bn. A further less serious problem loan
category, reflecting loans in arrears, fell from ADollars 1.23bn to ADollars
974.7m.
Mr David Murray, managing director, said valuations of the bank's commercial
property portfolio, covering exposures of about ADollars 7.2bn, indicated
that no further provisioning was necessary.
The performance allowed the bank to improve its risk weighted capital
adequacy ratio from 10.02 to 10.66 per cent, comfortably exceeding the
Reserve Bank's minimum 8 per cent requirement. The bank's total assets eased
from ADollars 88.9bn to ADollars 88.3bn.
Mr Murray said a key reason for the bank's improved earnings performance was
a a 3.6 per cent fall to ADollars 1.47bn in operating expenses. The bank
reduced its staff by just over 5,000 to 44,174 in the half.
'Further falls in operating expenses will be achieved as the integration of
the former State Bank of Victoria is completed,' he said. 'The banking
industry is likely to experience continuing low demand for credit which,
combined with the low household savings ratio, will maintain pressure on
margins.
By far the biggest contribution to the bank's profit came from banking
operations, up 1 per cent to ADollars 212.7m. Commonwealth's finance arm,
CBFC, remained profitable, more than doubling its contribution to ADollars
23.7m.

<TEXT>
TOYOTA, Japan's leading vehicle manufacturer, yesterday reported a 22.3 per
cent drop in pre-tax profits for the six months ended December, partly
because of lower interest income and exchange rate losses.
Toyota's sales were Y4,564bn (Dollars 37bn), up just 2.9 per cent on the
comparable six months of 1991. Pre-tax profits were Y46.5bn lower at Y162bn,
operating profit was 24.4 per cent lower at Y58.2bn and net income was 30
per cent down at Y72.3bn. It was the third successive year of declining
profits.
The deterioration in Toyota's finances has prompted a sharp rundown in cash
reserves. These have fallen from Y1,482bn at the end of July, 1992 to Y943bn
at the end of December. The company also sold about 37.5 per cent of its
stock of marketable securities, which stood at Y104bn in August.
The fall seems likely to continue as about Y190bn of equity warrants falls
due for redemption this June. The company, under the stewardship of chairman
Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, said it was exploring a variety of ways to finance the
redemption of the warrants.
Toyota blamed most of the 24 per cent fall in operating income on adverse
foreign exchange movements worth Y30bn, rising personnel costs worth Y20bn
and Y30bn due to the fall in sales. Interest and dividend income fell by
Y34bn to Y89bn, largely because of the fall in Japanese interest rates and
the sale of securities.
Although sales were up by 2.9 per cent, the cost of sales rose by 4.2 per
cent to Y4,172bn.
Overseas operations are playing an increasingly important role in bolstering
performance. Although vehicle sales were virtually flat at Y3,004bn, this
was largely because a Y75bn fall in domestic sales to Y1,698bn was offset by
a Y78bn increase in overseas sales.

SEARS, Roebuck, the heavily loss-making US retailer, has cut its dividend
for the first time in 60 years, with a 10 cents a share cut in the
fourth-quarter payout to 40 cents, Reuter reports from Chicago.
On Tuesday the company reported a loss of Dollars 10.72 a share for 1992,
down from a profit of Dollars 3.71 the year before. Analysts said the widely
anticipated cut would save about Dollars 140m a year.
Sears said the move reflected the strategic repositioning of the company,
including the spin-off of Dean Witter, its securities brokerage and
investment banking unit and Discover, its credit card business, expected to
take place in the middle of 1993.

ELECTRONIC Data Systems (EDS), the computer services subsidiary of General
Motors, yesterday unveiled a 14 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net income
to Dollars 178m from Dollars 155.9m a year earlier.
Earning's per share were 12 per cent higher at 37 cents against 33 cents,
while revenues were up 2 per cent at Dollars 2.14bn from Dollars 2.09bn.
On Wall Street, shares in General Motors' class E stock, whose value is tied
to EDS's performance, rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 39 1/4 at close of
trading. The stock climbed above Dollars 35 earlier this year on rumours
that British Telecom might be discussing buying a stake in the business.
The results met analysts' expectations.
For the whole of 1992, EDS earned Dollars 635.5m, or Dollars 1.33 a share. A
year earlier, net income stood at Dollars 547.5m, or Dollars 1.14, including
a charge of Dollars 15.5m, or 3 cents for accounting changes. Revenues
reached a record Dollars 8.22bn from Dollars 7.1bn in 1991.
EDS, which was founded by Mr Ross Perot and acquired by General Motors in
1984, is relying less on business from its GM parent. EDS said revenues from
non-GM sources grew to more than 59 per cent of its total revenues.
General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), General Motor's large
financial services arm, posted net income of Dollars 936.1m for 1992,
including charges on the adoption of new accounting standard SFAS Number
106.
In 1991, the company reported net income of Dollars 1.37bn, including
Dollars 331.5m gains from the adoption of SFAS Number 109 and after-tax
charges of Dollars 170.9m for a special wholesale loss provision.
Stripping out one-time items, Mr Robert O'Connell, GMAC's chairman, said
1992 net income stood at Dollars 1.24bn against Dollars 1.21bn in 1991 on a
comparable basis. 'Importantly, GMAC's 1992 performance was achieved in a
year of challenging events and significant change for the GMAC worldwide
organisation,' he said.
Income from GMAC's financing operations was Dollars 1.03bn, down slightly
from the Dollars 1.04bn earned a year earlier. During the year GMAC financed
or leased 33 per cent of new GM vehicles sold in the US against 35 per cent
in 1991. The number of new cars and trucks financed or leased by GMAC
slipped to 1.6m from 1.7m last year in the US.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Air Canada forecasts deficit of
CDollars 200m

GLOBAL recession, domestic overcapacity and heavy Canadian fuel taxes will
bring a CDollars 200m (USDollars 158.7m) loss for Air Canada this year, Mr
Hollis Harris, chairman, said yesterday.
The country's biggest airline, locked in a competitive struggle with rival
Canadian Airlines and the small Nationair, will also reveal next week that
1992 will show a record deficit. In the first nine months a net loss of
CDollars 307m was incurred after special charges, following losses of
CDollars 218m for 1991.
Mr Harris told the Canadian Commons transportation committee his airline
would break even on an operating basis in 1993 but this was before financial
and special charges. It should return to overall profitability in 1994 with
the full impact of manpower cuts and cost reduction programmes.
He said Air Canada had sufficient cash to complete its bid for 25 per cent
of Continental Airlines of the US and he was confident the alliance would be
approved by the US authorities. He said forming one Canadian carrier was the
solution to the Canadian airline industry's woes and he held out the
possibility again of a merger with PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Baby Bell agrees to buy two
cable TV companies
</HEADLINE>

SOUTHWESTERN Bell, one of the seven Baby Bell regional telephone companies
in the US, has agreed to buy two cable television systems in suburban
Washington DC for Dollars 650m - a move which marks a dramatic escalation of
the battle between telephone and cable industries to bring communications
into the 21st century American home.
Southwestern Bell is the first US telephone company to try to buy control of
a US cable television company and its move could set off a scramble by other
telecommunications companies.
However, the purchase requires regulatory approval from the Justice
Department, the Federal Communications Commission and Judge Harold Greene,
who has overseen the Baby Bells since they were split off from American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph in a 1984 anti-trust court settlement. Clearing all
these fences could take Southwestern Bell a very long time.
The seller of the two systems is Hauser Communications, a privately owned
company.
Southwestern Bell provides local telephone services in Texas and other
southwestern states. It is barred from owning a cable company there, under
1984 cable legislation which bars any local telephone company from owning a
cable business in its core operating area.
Southwestern Bell already owns a cellular telephone franchise in the
Washington area and could eventually try to link this into its cable system.
This would mean a competitive challenge to the Baby Bell which provides
normal, wired telephone services in this area, Bell Atlantic.
Southwestern Bell already has experience in the cable industry, since it
owns and operates a system in Britain and has interests in others in Israel.
The US cable and telecommunications industries are jostling for position as
America prepares for an explosion of information delivered to the home,
ranging from movies-on-demand to video telephone calls.
Just a few weeks ago Time-Warner, one of the largest cable companies,
announced plans for the most ambitious multi-media home service yet launched
on a commercial basis, combining both entertainment and telephony, which it
aims to introduce in Florida.
Mr Edward Whitacre, chairman of Southwestern Bell, said the Washington cable
purchase was 'in the right industry, in the right place at the right time'.
