FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Molson held back by weak beer
market

<TEXT>
MOLSON Companies, the diversified Canadian brewer, suffered a 24 per cent
setback in its latest quarterly earnings, largely as a result of a weak beer
market, retaliatory duties on beer imposed by the US and the costs of
converting to a new beer bottle.
Net earnings fell to CDollars 25.3m (USDollars 20m), or 42 cents a share, in
the three months to December 31, the third quarter of the company's fiscal
year, from CDollars 33.4m, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenues rose to CDollars 769.8m from CDollars 723.3m.
The negative factors were partially offset by CDollars 4.9m in fees received
from the North American ice hockey league, one of whose teams is owned by
Molson.
Nine-month earnings fell to CDollars 100.1m, or CDollars 1.68 a share, from
CDollars A 110.4m, or CDollars 1.97 a share.
The company said yesterday that the decline in earnings for the year as a
whole was likely to be 10 to 12 per cent.
Molson, whose non-brewing interests include cleaning services and a retail
hardware chain in Canada, said that its businesses are still being hurt by
the recession.
Operating earnings of Molson Breweries, a joint venture with Foster's
Brewing of Australia, fell to CDollars 135.3m from CDollars 143m.
Total beer sales in Canada dipped by 3.6 per cent in the nine months to last
December and Molson's market share slipped to 50.2 per cent from 51.9 per
cent a year earlier.
Its share rallied to 50.4 per cent in the latest quarter.
Molson said its alliance with Miller Brewing of the US, announced last
month, is expected to be finalised in early April.
Under the deal, Miller will acquire 20 per cent of Molson Breweries from the
existing partners.
It will also gain marketing and distribution rights for Molson and Foster's
brands in the US.
Molson expects to receive about CDollars 180m for its part of the sale.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: US insurers report heavy losses

<TEXT>
AETNA Life &amp; Casualty and Travelers, two of the largest composite insurers
in the US, yesterday reported heavy fourth-quarter losses, following a
variety of special charges both companies had announced last week.
Travelers incurred the bigger loss for the final quarter of 1992 - Dollars
589m, compared with a profit of Dollars 69m a year earlier - in the wake of
several charges, including: Dollars 485m to cover a Dollars 735m addition to
property and mortgage loan reserves; Dollars 59m for costs linked to
Hurricane Andrew; and Dollars 79m related to litigation and assesments for
industry guarantee funds.
The large quarterly loss meant that Travelers reported a deficit of Dollars
658m for all of 1992, compared with a profit of Dollars 318m in 1991.
Apart from the charges outlined in the fourth quarter results, the insurer
had taken other charges earlier in the year to cover the cost of meeting
Hurricane Andrew claims and to pay for a corporate restructuring.
Separately, Travelers last year booked a Dollars 170m one-off gain related
to the adoption of two new accounting standards.
At Aetna, the fourth-quarter loss totalled Dollars 192m after the company
took a Dollars 180m charge to boost reserves for asbestos and environmental
claims. In the same quarter last year, Aetna recorded a net profit of
Dollars 93m. For all of 1992, the insurer reported net income of only
Dollars 56m, down sharply from the Dollars 505m profit made in 1991.
Aside from the charges, Aetna said its fourth-quarter and full-year results
were affected by high catastrophe losses, poor workers compensation results,
depressed commercial property values, and continued soft pricing conditions
in its main domestic insurance markets.
The one bright spot was the company's health business, although even there
Aetna's 1992 earnings were well down on the previous year.
Because the special charges and quarterly losses had been well flagged in
advance, the stock markets displayed little reaction to the news from
Travelers and Aetna.

CHRYSLER, the US vehicle manufacturer, has raised more than Dollars 2bn
after selling 52m shares at Dollars 38 3/4 each in the second biggest public
common stock issue by a US company.
The company exercised a 'green shoe' option - or stabilisation provision -
to buy an additional 6m shares, swelling the offer size by 30 per cent from
the original plan of 40m shares.
On Wall Street, shares in Chrysler firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 39 3/8 at
midday yesterday.
The company has indicated it will use at least half the funds raised to cut
its Dollars 3.9bn underfunded pension obligations.

NOUVELLES Frontieres, the French travel company, bucked the slump in the
holiday industry by increasing its net profits 42 per cent to FFr161m
(Dollars 30m) in its last full financial year.
The group is number two in the French holiday market after Club Med, having
raised turnover by 12 per cent to just over FFr5bn in the year to September
30, from FFr4.46bn. Mr Jacques Maillot, chairman, said that sales had grown
faster in the first four months of the current year.
Mr Maillot said the company had managed to overcome the financial pressures
of the economic slowdown by keeping tight control of its interests.

SUN International Boph-uthatswana (Sunbop), the South African gaming and
leisure group, yesterday announced a 3 per cent fall in taxable profits to
R136.5m (Dollars 43.7m) in the six months to December, down from R141.4m a
year earlier.
This was in spite of a 15 per cent increase in turnover by Sunbop, whose
hotels are all located in the Bophuthatswana homeland, to R556.4m from
R483.4m.
Mr Sol Kerzner, chairman, attributed the revenue performance, achieved in
the face of an 'extremely poor economic environment', to having the benefit
of its new Carousel resort for the full six months. The opening of the R830m
Lost City project in December, amid saturation media coverage, also boosted
turnover.
Average occupancies at the company's hotels, however, dropped to 72 per cent
from 78 per cent the previous year, and this put pressure on margins,
leading to the lower profits.
Earnings per share dropped to 93 cents per share, from 96 cents a year
earlier, because of an increased number of shares in issue. The interim
dividend was maintained at 64 cents a share.

IMASCO'S financial services unit, through a US subsidiary, is buying
USDollars 660m in deposits and 18 branches in the Rochester and Buffalo
areas from two New York-based savings and loan companies.
The acquisitions, from Anchor Savings Bank and Dime Savings Bank, will raise
the indirect Imasco subsidiary's network in the north-eastern US to 86
branches and an asset base of well over USDollars 5bn. Market share in the
expanding Buffalo, NY, market will rise to 6 per cent.
Imasco owns Canada's largest trust company, Canada Trustco, through CT
Financial Services, and the US subsidiary is First Federal Savings and Loan,
based in Rochester and acquired by CT in 1991.
Imasco would not reveal the price paid for both deals but it said First
Federal is not acquiring any loan portfolios.
The deals are part of Imasco's financial services expansion in the US
north-east.
Abitibi Price, the big newsprint producer now owned by creditors of Olympia
&amp; York Developments, is raising CDollars 150m (USDollars 119m) with an issue
of convertible debentures. The proceeds will be used to reduce long-term
debt.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Investor group plans to take
stake in Banesto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of investors led by JP Morgan, the US investment bank, is to take a
stake of between 7 per cent and 10 per cent in Banesto, Spain's
third-largest bank, as part of a Pta53bn (Dollars 452m) rights issue being
prepared by the Spanish bank.
JP Morgan's recently closed Dollars 1bn Corsair banking fund, and Mr Mario
Conde, Banesto's chairman, will form the core of the investor group.
The US bank has guaranteed that its group will invest Dollars 200m in the
rights issue.
Mr Conde's inclusion will raise his personal stake in Banesto from 2 per
cent to up to 4.5 per cent.
If the rights issue, one of the largest in Spain, is fully taken up and if
Banesto's efforts to sell its affiliate, Banco de Madrid, to Deutsche Bank
of Germany, are successful, Banesto will have rid itself of a cloud under
which it has been forced to operate for nearly three years.
The bank would then fall comfortably within the Bank of Spain's strict
guidelines on the relationship between its capital and its exposure to
industry.
'This is a lifesaver for the bank,' said Mr Juan Bastos, chief executive of
the Madrid securities house, Gestemar.
The issue is viewed by some as a bid by Banesto to gain manoeuvrability at a
time when it is reducing its profits and seeking to dispose of its
industrial assets in a depressed market.
Under the terms of the three-for-one rights issue, JP Morgan will place
shares with the investor group at Pta1,900 per share.
In all, 35.11m new shares are being offered at a premium of Pta800 per
share.
In addition to the increased capital, Banesto would gain an important
psychological lift through JP Morgan's endorsement of its business
potential.
The investor group is understood to have committed itself to stay with the
bank for at least five years, and JP Morgan is likely to be given a seat on
the Banesto board.
JP Morgan issued a highly positive report on the Spanish bank before
Christmas.
'Morgan is putting its money where its mouth is,' one Madrid analyst
commented yesterday.
Banesto reported a 27 per cent fall in its net profits during 1992 to
Pta45.6bn due to a sharp drop in extraordinary income from disposals.
It was nevertheless able to report a 17 per cent increase in the gross
operating profit of its banking business, which totalled Pta119.6bn
Having sold its industrial assets in oil refining and cement in the past two
years, Banesto is now seeking buyers for its holdings in Acerinox, the major
domestic stainless steel producer, and in Union Carburos, its industrial
gases group.
This strategy, which seeks a more reduced and flexible industrial portfolio,
complements Banesto's attempts to improve income from its core financial
sector.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi tightens hold on
Fondiaria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRUZZI, the Italian industrial group, yesterday tightened its management
hold over Fondiaria, the Florentine insurer that it jointly controls.
At the same, Ferruzzi - which has debts of more than L10,700bn (Dollars 7bn)
 -responded to speculation that it would dispose of Fondiaria in order to
reduce its borrowings by stressing that the company was not for sale.
The announcement followed a board meeting at the troubled insurance company,
which saw the resignation of Mr Alfonso Scarpa, its long-standing managing
director, and the appointment of Mr Carlo Sama, a senior Ferruzzi executive
and husband of one of the Ferruzzi heiresses, as Fondiaria's new chairman.
Mr Sama replaces Mr Camillo De Benedetti, the Italian financier and cousin
of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, who died last month. Mr Camillo De Benedetti
shared control of Fondiaria with Ferruzzi through Gaic, a quoted holding
company.
Ferruzzi's financial difficulties and Fondiaria's waning profitability have
led to speculation that part or all of the insurance operation may be sold.
However, Mr Sama said he considered Fondiaria 'Ferruzzi's life insurance,
and . . . one doesn't sell life insurance'.
Fondiaria, which appointed Mr Arrigo Bianchi di Lavagna as its new managing
director, gave no indication of how it planned to improve earnings. Its
financial performance has deteriorated as a result of difficulties in the
Italian insurance sector and setbacks in its own ambitious expansion policy.
Fondiaria's biggest problems have arisen in Germany, where it owns 20 per
cent of Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, the big insurance group in
which Assurances Generales de France is now the major shareholder.
Mr Bianchi di Lavagna, an experienced insurance and banking executive, was
previously managing director of Unione di Riassicurazione, the reinsurance
company owned by leading Italian insurers. No indication was given of Mr
Scarpa's future plans.

<TEXT>
MR RAUL GARDINI, the former Ferruzzi chief and Mr Jody Vender, majority
owner of Sopaf, the merchant bank, have joined forces to create Italy's
third-largest frozen-foods group, writes Haig Simonian in Milan.
The new group, known as Argel, will comprise Finagel, the frozen-foods
concern controlled by Sopaf's Invest subsidiary, and Sias, a frozen-foods
company owned indirectly by the Grigolini family. It is also expected to
work closely with Vital-Sogeviandes, a French meat company owned by Mr
Gardini.
The new company could soon expand further with the possible purchase of
assets from the state-owned SME foods and retailing concern.
In a complex deal, Invest and Garma, the fast-growing Italian food concern
controlled by Mr Gardini and Mr Giulio Malgara, will take 35 per cent each
in the new group. Sias will have a 20 per cent stake, while the remaining 10
per cent will be sold to unspecified institutional investors. Garma will
have management control.
With sales of about L300bn (Dollars 197m), Argel will have around 15 per
cent of the Italian frozen-foods market, on a par with the foods business of
SME's Italgel subsidiary. Argel has made no secret of its interest in
bidding for Italgel's food interests as part of the SME privatisation.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCHNEIDER, the French electrical engineering and construction group, is in
negotiations to sell Jeumont-Schneider, its electronic components
subsidiary, to Framatome, the state-owned supplier of nuclear reactors.
The two companies yesterday confirmed that they were in discussions and were
finalising the terms of the sale.
The Jeumont disposal is expected to be a complex deal, with Framatome
retaining the company's nuclear activities but selling its non-nuclear
interests to Alcatel Alsthom, the state-controlled electronics group.
Jeumont produces components for use in the nuclear industry and electrical
engineering. It employs 2,000 and had sales of FFr1.6bn (Dollars 290m) in
1992. The group has been considerably scaled down since the mid-1980s,
notably by the sale of its telephone interests to Bosch of Germany.
The Jeumont sale would include the disposal of its 47.5 per cent stake in
Jeumont-Schneider Automation, which specialises in the motor sector. This
company, with a workforce of 270, had turnover of FFr230m last year.
The deal would form part of the ongoing divestment programme at Schneider,
which is trying to reduce the debt amassed by the acquisition of Square D,
the US construction company. Schneider raised FFr1bn from disposals last
year, leaving the present level of net debt at around FFr19bn.
However, debt-financing costs contributed to a sharp fall in Schneider's
interim net profits to FFr193m in the first half of 1992, from FFr302m in
the same period of 1991.
The group has also been affected by the cost of integrating Square D and the
problems of Spie Batignolles, its French construction company. CS First
Boston forecasts a more moderate fall in Schneider's net profits for the
full 1992 year, to FFr272m from FFr275m in 1991.
Framatome has been trying to adjust to the decline in world demand for
nuclear reactors. The decision to sell the non-nuclear part of Jeumont to
Alcatel, which owns 44 per cent of Framatome, comes as a number of
state-owned companies are reshuffling their interests in the run-up to the
March elections, after which the next French government is expected to
accelerate the privatisation programme.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Upbeat forecast from Parmalat
sees 1993 sales ahead by 50%

PARMALAT, the Italian dairy foods group, expects sales to surge by about 50
per cent to L2,400bn (Dollars 1.6bn) this year on the back of buoyant
internal growth and continuing acquisitions.
The company, which has made a strong recovery since its recapitalisation in
1990, said that turnover in 1992 rose by 21.5 per cent to L1,613bn.
Mr Domenico Barili, director general, said operating earnings had risen by
17.3 per cent to L203bn.
In 1991, Parmalat Finanziaria, the listed holding company, reported net
earnings of L42bn. Full 1992 results will not be released until March.
However, on the basis of yesterday's figures, analysts forecast net group
profits in the range of L50bn-55bn.
Mr Barili said that operating profits should rise by a further 22 per cent
to L248bn this year.
Parmalat, around 27 per cent of whose capital is held abroad, expects most
of its growth to come outside Italy.
The group is expanding fast in eastern Europe, South America and the US.
In 1992, sales in Europe, excluding Italy, jumped 164 per cent to L66bn.
In south America - principally Brazil and Argentina - sales climbed by 28.7
per cent to L260bn, while US turnover reached L13bn.
All three areas are expected to surge this year, with growth rates of 263
per cent in Europe and 111 per cent in south America.
Sales in the US are forecast to climb almost 15-fold to L189bn.
The forecasts are based on acquisitions that have already been made - such
as that of the Fejertej dairy group in Hungary - and two other transactions
which have not yet been announced, but are virtually sealed, it said.
Italian turnover is forecast to rise by 13 per cent.
Mr Barili stressed that the acquisition-led expansion would not involve a
big rise in Parmalat's net debts, which stood at L465bn at the end of
December 1992.
Interest charges in 1993 were forecast to edge up to L79bn from L71bn in
1992, while interest costs as a proportion of sales would fall to 3.3 per
cent to 4.4 per cent in 1992.

FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Snecma says it made loss last
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SNECMA, France's state-controlled aero-engine maker, yesterday said it had
made a loss for 1992 but did not disclose the size, writes Alice Rawsthorn
in Paris.
The company blamed the gloomy economic environment and delays in orders for
civil and military aircraft. The group was also in the red in 1991, when it
fell into a net loss of FFr67.8m (Dollars 12.6m) from net profits of FFr208m
in 1990.
Its performance has since deteriorated with a fall in sales to around
FFr23bn in 1992, against FFr23.9bn in 1991. Snecma also suffered a FFr3bn
decline in the value of new orders from the previous year's total of
FFr7.3bn.
The group has already announced plans to step up its cost-cutting programme.
It proposes making additional annual savings of FFr500m by reducing stocks
and accelerating its research cycle.
These cuts will involve the loss of 650 jobs and 20 days of temporary
lay-offs this year.
Michelin, the world's largest tyre manufacturer, reported a 1.2 per cent
decline in turnover to FFr66.8bn in 1992, from FFr66bn in 1991. The group
said it had been affected by sluggish demand and exchange rate changes.
Michelin, which returned to the black with net profits of FFr820m in the
first half of 1992, against a net loss of FFr1.06bn in the same period of
1991, is already implementing a long-term rationalisation programme.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Simon shares fall on contract warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Simon Engineering fell 20p to 119p yesterday on news that
it would make a Pounds 5m loss on a Dollars 103m (Pounds 68.2m) contract.
Analysts yesterday lowered their forecasts for the engineering and
environmental group from between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m to between Pounds
6m and Pounds 7m.
They also believe the final dividend will be passed, leaving a total down
from 15.7p to 5p.
Management was criticised because this was not the first time Simon had
suffered cost over-runs on a paper mill contract. The latest problems relate
to a contract to rebuild the world's largest liner board paper mill in
Jacksonville, Florida. for Seminole Kraft, an arm of Stone Corporation.
On the previous occasion, Stone was also the client, though Mr Alan Jarvis,
Simon's finance director, said the group took over the Hoya contract in
Germany when it acquired Holder Pamac Group in 1989.
On the Jacksonville contract, Mr Jarvis said: 'We felt we had done all we
could do to avoid this situation,' though he conceded that it had been
'poorly costed'.
He added that Simon had lodged a 'substantial' claim with Stone over
'unagreed contract variations' where specifications had been altered during
the course of the work. He said that 'substantial' meant more than 10 per
cent of the value of the contract and that the two companies were currently
in negotiations.
Mr Jarvis said that as soon as a loss on a contract was recognised, it had
to be written off, though he stressed that Simon was 'not in danger of
breaching any of its banking covenants'.
Simon said the Pounds 260m factory contract in Armenia, had been completed
successfully.

Shares of Elbief yesterday fell 5p to 21p as the Birmingham-based
manufacturer of photograph frames, clocks and mirrors accompanied news of an
increased interim deficit with a gloomy trading statement.
Losses before tax for the six months to October 31 increased to Pounds

pruned severely and employee numbers were drastically reduced, but this was
negated by lower sales.' Turnover declined 17 per cent to Pounds 1.9m.
Mr Prais said he saw little sign of an end to recession and did not
anticipate a return to profits in the current year.
Losses per share were 0.2p (0.04p).

Third quarter profits of Elan Corporation, the Irish health care products

For the nine months to December 31, profits rose from IPounds 8.58m to
IPounds 14.15m.
Mr Donald E Panoz, chairman, said the growth could be attributed to the
success of Cardizem CD in the US market.
Although sales by Lederle of Prostep declined significantly in the US, that
was partly offset by increased sales of the nicotine patch in international
markets.
Turnover improved from IPounds 14.9m to IPounds 23.4m. Earnings per share

SALES OF investments, mainly the disposal of part of its stake in Bristol
Channel Ship Repairers, produced a Pounds 1.24m credit for CH Bailey in the

773,250. Sales rose some 12 per cent from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 2.34m, but
margins remained slim. The corresponding period saw a Pounds 305,600 loss.
Mr Christopher Bailey, chairman of both Bailey and Bristol Channel, in which
CH Bailey retains an 8 per cent stake, also voiced his opposition to the
Cardiff Bay barrage bill.
He said that if the scheme, which is being considered in the House of Lords,
was sanctioned it would make shiprepairing at the Bute dry dock impossible.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS ABBEY Life, the life assurance group, announced profits before tax of
Pounds 297.6m for 1992, a rise of 4.2 per cent on the previous year's Pounds
285.5m, restated under new accounting standards.
The total dividend remains at 17.3p via a proposed maintained final of 11p,
payable from earnings of 28p (29.1p) per share.
Black Horse Financial Services, a 'bankassurance' company which sells
products only to customers of Lloyds Bank, registered a 23.5 per cent growth
in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 89.5m to Pounds 110.5m.
However, profits at Abbey Life, its other UK life assurance division which
sells mostly through a direct sales force, rose by only 2.4 per cent to
Pounds 146.4m (Pounds 142.9m).
Abbey Life's relatively poor performance was attributed to expenses of new
regulatory requirements on training and competence, which led to a reduction
in the sales force from 3,507 to 3,200.
Lloyds Bank Insurance Services, which sells general insurance, increased
pre-tax profits by 7.7 per cent to Pounds 58.8m (Pounds 54.6m).
Profits before tax at Lloyds Bowmaker, the finance company affected by a
Pounds 100.5m bad debt write-off, dropped from Pounds 22.3m to Pounds 16.2m.
Black Horse Agencies, the estate agency, saw losses reduced from Pounds
21.4m to Pounds 10.6m.
The worst results were suffered by Trans Leben, the group's German life
subsidiary, which incurred a loss of Pounds 14.1m (profits of Pounds 7.5m).
This reflected strict reserving requirements for its 'with-profits'
business.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Benson reaches Pounds 0.8m as growth
continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH AT Benson Group, the Wolverhampton-based engineering company,
continued during its first half to November 30.
Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 225,000 to Pounds 817,000 on turnover of
Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 4.85m).
The profits growth marks an extension of last year's second-half trend and
follows the absorption of five acquisitions. New management arrived in 1990
and undertook corporate surgery earlier in the recession than many of its
peers. The group has disengaged from the difficult agricultural machinery
markets.
Margins have been maintained at the levels of the last financial year in the
three main lines of business - environmental controls, vehicle engineering
and engineering components. 'We have been determined not to enter the fray
of reducing prices,' said Mr Richard Phillips, chairman.
Earnings per share were 0.55p (0.39p) and the interim dividend is restored
with a payment of 0.1p. For 1991-92, Benson paid a final, also of 0.1p.
Gearing rose from 30 to 50 per cent during the six months.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: A downturn reaching to the core - David
Simon has had a baptism of fire at British Petroleum. Deborah Hargreaves
reports on the expected losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum will today report a loss for last year and a sharp cut in
its dividend as the company has seen a downturn in all of its main
businesses.
The decline in core activities, such as refining and marketing, is even
worse than can have been imagined by Mr David Simon, chief executive, when
he took on the post after the ousting of Mr Bob Horton last June.
BP is expected to report a loss of between Pounds 350m and Pounds 400m on a
replacement cost basis, which strips out the effects of stock losses and
gains, but this figure could be clouded by changes in BP's accounting
standards.
Investment analysts expect the company to pay a dividend of 2.1p for the
final quarter, making a full year pay-out of 10.5p - down from 16.8p in
1991.
The company is continuing its programme of severe cost-cutting set in train
by Mr Horton and stepped up by Mr Simon last August.
Mr Simon is believed to have curtailed capital expenditure in the second
half of last year even more than he said he would as the scale of the
downturn became clear to him.
Mr Nick Clayton, oil analyst at Smith New Court, expects BP to show that it
has cut capital spending by Pounds 400m in the second half to leave a total
of about Pounds 3.2bn for the full year.
'The company is doing all the right things in cutting costs, but it is
getting absolutely no help from the external environment,' said Mr Clayton.
Severe over-capacity in the chemicals sector had turned that market into a
'bloodbath'.
In addition, over-production by European oil refineries has cut margins to a
level of about Dollars 1 (60p) a barrel this week which means no companies
are making money. Oil companies need a margin of at least Dollars 3 a barrel
to make a profit on refining.
Crude oil prices have remained low and this hurts BP which is more exposed
to the oil price than rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell.
One bright spot for the company is the pound's fall against the dollar,
translating into higher revenues from crude oil sales.
By the same token, BP's share price has performed strongly in the UK as US
analysts have started to buy the stock.
A favourable exchange rate and the round of cost-cutting has turned into a
slightly higher expected income for BP for the final quarter of last year in
spite of the deteriorating fundamentals.
Analysts expect fourth quarter income to be between Pounds 150m and Pounds
200m on a replacement cost basis which is an improvement on the Pounds 72m
earned in the last quarter of 1991.
However, few in the City expect the upturn to be sustained until there is a
pick-up in the oil market.
BP also faces initial costs for part of its restructuring programme, which
aims to reduce the workforce by 11 per cent. Redundancy payments could cost
the company Pounds 300m in the next six months.
Cash is a key element for BP to get under control. Mr Clayton believes last
year's results will point to a net outflow of Pounds 850m.
Mr Simon cannot let up on his cost-cutting initiative while the fundamentals
of his businesses remain so poor.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Airtours resumes attack in Owners bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS yesterday returned to the attack in its bid to take over Owners
Abroad, arguing that shareholders in the rival holiday group have been given
inadequate explanations as to why their company has performed relatively so
badly.
In a letter to shareholders, Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said
that contrary to Owners Abroad's claim that his company was 'running out of
steam', Airtours' increases in bookings were gathering momentum.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, replied that in neither of
Airtours' two offer documents had it supplied a convincing explanation of
the strategy for the enlarged group. Airtours had also failed to quantify
the benefits which it claimed would come from the merger.
Mr Crossland said that he was particularly upset by the claim that Airtours
had chosen the wrong aircraft in the MD83. This older, but commercially
proven, aircraft had been chosen because at the time the A320 had not been
in operation for more than 4,000 flying hours a year.
Airtours had decided not to risk starting a new charter airline with a new
aircraft.
Mr Crossland refuted Owners Abroad's claim that Airtours' 30 per cent
expansion in capacity in 1991 had been 'risky'. Airtours had moved very
rapidly - but according to a plan - in snapping up hotel beds and airline
seats when ILG went bust.
As a result Airtours had been able to double its market share, adding five
percentage points to take it up to about 12 per cent of the air inclusive
tour market that year. Owners Abroad had only increased its market share by
one percentage point in summer 1991.
Mr Crossland said that while his company had increased its market
capitalisation by Pounds 186m in the five years to last September, Owners
Abroad's worth had shrunk.
Twenty four MPs have signed an early day motion, calling on Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to refer Airtours' proposed
takeover of Owners Abroad to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Already,
Thomas Cook, the travel agency and financial services group, the Consumers'
Association and the Association of Independent Tour Operators have called
for a referral.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Legacy of a laid-back American - The leaner
Storehouse left by its departing chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DAY after his appointment as head of one of the largest department store
chains in the US, Mr David Dworkin still lives up to his laid-back image.
He is toying with a late lunch of baked potato, beans and coleslaw at his
desk, after a work-out at the gym.
But if exercise and healthy eating have helped Mr Dworkin shed quite a few
pounds since he arrived from the US three years' ago to head BhS, the
department store chain, a similar transformation has taken place at that
company and the parent Storehouse group which he took over last summer.
Mr Dworkin characterises the change thus. Storehouse when he arrived was
'amorphous, and a bit chaotic. It was non-symmetrical, a portfolio of
non-related business entities.'
Today, it is 'unified, focused, with the same philosophies governing the
businesses.'
The City seems to agree with him, and credits him with the transformation.
Storehouse shares, which hit a low of 85p in December 1991, recently touched
219p. In the last two days, the jitters caused by the news of his departure
have knocked almost 10 per cent off the shares, although analysts say the
reaction may be overdone. Mr Dworkin, they say, has made the fundamental
changes that were required, and set the company back on course.
The 49-year-old American has sometimes been ruthless. To cut costs, he
sacked 900 people, and got rid of the 'legions and layers, all the fluff and
the nonsense,' removing four layers of management.
Some functions were contracted out, old stock was sold off cheaply, and the
image of BhS was rethought, with better use made of displays and space, and
brighter stores.
There were mistakes, but the strategy worked. Year-on-year sales increases
have run at about 8 per cent for the last 16 months, and margins have also
improved.
Last summer, Mr Dworkin rose to head the Storehouse group. Officially, this
was due to the failure of then chief executive Mr Michael Julien to throw
off a lingering virus, but some accounts suggest Mr Dworkin may have been
threatening a return to the US even then.
The slimming down of the business continued. The Habitat and Richards chains
were sold, leaving Storehouse focused on BhS and Mothercare.
Mr Dworkin appointed Ms Ann Iverson, a colleague from his days at Bonwit
Teller, the US stores group, to head Mothercare and introduce BhS-style
reforms.
The process is far from complete. Mr Dworkin claims that while Storehouse's
total floorspace is 7m sq ft, 3.6m of which is selling space, 1m sq ft are
'fallow', waiting to be 'recaptured' for trading.
He planned to stay at least another year. But two weeks' ago the call came
from Carter Hawley Hale.
The stores chain, based in the western US, had been looking for a new chief
executive since last October. It was too tempting to refuse.
'The set of circumstances that appealed to me when I arrived here exist at
Carter Hawley,' Mr Dworkin says. 'It's the thrill, the challenge, the
excitement of having something major to accomplish. It is a bit of an ego
thing.'
There were also family reasons. Mr Dworkin wanted to be reunited with his
two daughters in the US.
Carter Hawley's 83 department stores sell fashions to furniture and
household goods, under the names The Broadway, The Broadway SouthWest,
Emporium and Weinstocks.
The Broadway name, Mr Dworkin says, enjoys a similar reputation in
California to Marks and Spencer in the UK.
Rising debts, however, led the group to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in 1991. It began to reorganise and slim down, and emerged from
chapter 11 last October with 16m sq ft of selling space, including many
prime locations.
The group is already profitable and has a high turnover, but is rudderless.
'Dollars 2bn sales a year without a game plan is a lot of business,' remarks
Mr Dworkin. He sees his role as similar to that at Storehouse: providing
leadership, removing the fat and devising a strategy.
Storehouse, meanwhile, is looking in both the UK and the US for a
replacement. It is stressing the need for continuity, but says the new chief
is likely to come from outside the group.
Mr Dworkin looks back with some satisfaction. 'I would be less than honest
if I said I wasn't proud. How many managements tried to turn around BhS? It
was supposed to be the poison pill.'

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Chinese mount reverse takeover of Stonehill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIVATE Chinese-based property development company is coming to the London
market through a Pounds 51.7m reverse takeover of Stonehill Holdings, the UK
property management group which owns and manages Stonehill Business Park in
north London.
Under the terms of the agreement, Stonehill will acquire Cathay
International United Investments for Pounds 51.7m in new paper from Cathay
International Investment, a company set up in 1988 and owned by Mr Wu Zhen
Tao, a former Beijing government official.
Of the 517m new Stonehill shares which CII will receive, 117m will be placed
with institutional and corporate investors in China, Hong Kong and the UK by
Marshall Securities.
Stonehill, a furniture manufacturer until the late 1980s, has a market
capitalisation of Pounds 2.31m and posted a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds
170,000 (Pounds 290,000) in the six months to September 30.
The group's shares were suspended at its request early last month at 11p
apiece.
Once the acquisition is completed Stonehill will become a subsidiary of CII
with Mr Wu, who was born and educated in Beijing and has held a number of
important positions in government scientific and financial institutions in
China, as chief executive.
The company then plans a 2-for-1 rights issue of 42m shares to raise Pounds
4.2m which will be used to reduce borrowings and provide working capital for
the new enlarged group.
In addition CII will make a general offer for the existing 21m shares to
satisfy the City Code on takeovers and mergers. The transactions have been
arranged so that CII will own not less than 69 per cent and not more than
74.3 per cent of the enlarged group.
CIU's main asset is the 346-room Landmark Hotel in Shenzhen, China, which
represents the final phase of a mixed housing, retail and commercial
development undertaken by CIU.
The hotel is due to open in June and will be managed under contract by a
joint venture company between CII and the Hong Kong-based Koppen Yan
Zimmermmann group.
Mr James Buchanan, Stonehill's chairman, said the deal will enable the
enlarged group to pursue property opportunities in both China and the UK.
Despite closing its furniture operations the UK group has remained highly
geared and loss-making and has lacked the resources to expand.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: PPI administrators begin proceedings
against Citibank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ADMINISTRATORS of Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit and
electronics group, began High Court proceedings in London yesterday against
Citibank in an attempt to recover some Pounds 75m of missing funds.
The suit also names the New York-based banking group's Swiss banking
subsidiary and Confidas Finance et Placement, a Luxembourg-based associate
which provides the bank's customers with fiduciary and trust services.
The proceedings relate to about Pounds 75m of the Pounds 371m in Polly Peck
funds which the company's administrators contend were misappropriated by Mr
Asil Nadir, Polly Peck's former chairman and chief executive. Civil and
criminal proceedings are already under way against Mr Nadir.
According to the administrators the Pounds 75m was transferred from Citibank
in London to Zurich where it was used by Mr Nadir for personal purposes.
They also claim that 'a substantial part' of the Pounds 75m was paid out
through a web of offshore companies provided and managed for Mr Nadir by
Confidas Finance.
The administrators, led in this action by Mr Christopher Morris of Touche
Ross, claim that Citibank and the other defendants are liable because they
knew or ought to have known of Mr Nadir's fraud.
Citibank said the suit would be 'vigorously defended.'

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Gillette wins clearance from trade
secretary for Pounds 285m Parker Pen bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 285m bid for Parker Pen by Gillette, the US shaving and
toiletries manufacturer, was cleared yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
inquiry found that the deal would not operate against the public interest.
According to the MMC, Parker supplies about half the value of UK sales of
refillable pens, while the Waterman and Paper Mate brands, which Gillette
already owns, account for a further 7 per cent.
The MMC found that any attempt to exploit its position in the retail market
would be constrained by numerous competitors and the bargaining power of
larger retailers.
The MMC was concerned that consumers could be misled by retailers' use of
staff deployed by suppliers but not identified as such. Mr Hes-eltine said
the Office of Fair Trading would investigate.
The proposed Parker acquisition, agreed in September, is still being studied
in the US.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Results Season: How the FT will use FRS 3 accounting rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANGES to company accounts triggered by the new FRS 3 accounting
standard will have an impact on companies' results and the way the Financial
Times reports them.
For many companies, pre-tax profits and earnings per share will be more
volatile. However, FRS 3's requirement on them to give more financial data
will bring more detail and depth to our reporting and analysis.
Not all companies will switch to FRS 3 before the June 22 deadline. For
those that do, we will report their results in the following way:
The main measure will remain pre-tax profits for the latest period compared
with the previous year's figure. For a transitional period, we will show a
second comparative figure based on the previous standard.
Any factors distorting pre-tax profits, such as the cost of rationalising or
disposing of businesses, will be fully reported.
Our reports will carry all the figures needed to give a full review of a
company's performance. The FRS 3 data will allow for example, a clearer
picture to be given of the impact of acquisitions and the cost of disposals.
Thus, a more accurate assessment will be possible, for example, of the
profitability of a company's on-going businesses.
Greater use will also be made ofcashflow statements introduced under FRS 1.
The FT will report the earnings per share derived under FRS 3, contrasted to
the year earlier figure. We may also report any alternative earnings quoted
by the company.
For analytical pieces, such as Company Comments and corporate profiles, we
will draw on p/e ratios based on eps figures adjusted to remove anomalies
and to give a guide to companies' on-going performance. Brokers' analysts
have begun work on such adjusted figures; we will be following their efforts
closely.
FT Statistics, the department which provides the London Share Service
prices, is discussing the appropriate treatment of earnings for the p/e
ratios shown on these pages. The policy to be adopted will be announced in
due course.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Results Season: Effects as companies rally to a new
standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID TWEEDIE, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, recently said
there was a need to develop standards that the person in the street could
understand. FRS 3, the new financial reporting standard on the profit and
loss account, does not fall into that category.
But over the coming months, anyone examining companies' financial results
will rapidly begin to see the effect of the standard and will have to learn
to cope with its effects.
FRS 3 becomes mandatory for companies with financial year-ends after June 22
this year. The Accounting Standards Board has urged companies to begin
complying before this time.
It is essentially a standard dealing with disclosure and presentation of
financial information, rather than specifying new ways of treating the
numbers. The most important changes are:
Extraordinary items - costs or realisations which are fundamentally
different to a company's normal activities - will be virtually abolished.
Any that remain will be placed above the bottom line, so they will be
included in the pre-tax profits figure.
Pre-tax profits and earnings will become far more volatile from year-to-year
as a result, forcing readers of accounts to examine the details rather than
focusing on a single figure of financial performance.
Exceptional items - other large material items outside the company's
continuing business operations - will be largely absorbed into other
headings on the profit and loss account. Three will remain separately
disclosed: profits or losses on sale or termination of an operation; costs
of a fundamental reorganisation or restructuring; profits or losses on the
sale of fixed assets.
Turnover and profits must be broken down between three separate categories:
continuing operations, acquisitions as a component of these operations, and
discontinued operations.
The proceeds on the disposal of revalued assets must be recorded with
reference to the carrying value or revalued amount shown on the balance
sheet, where previously it was left in reserves.
A new statement of total recognised gains and losses will show the effect of
any changes to reserves such as revaluations, and of exchange adjustments,
which were all previously buried in the notes to the accounts.
A note of historical cost profits and losses will reconcile the effects of
any revaluations to the historical level at which they were shown in the
balance sheet.
A reconciliation of movements in shareholders' funds shows changes such as
goodwill on acquisitions and new share capital issued.
So far, only a handful of companies have complied. These include BOC, Blue
Circle, Hanson and Trafalgar House. A larger number of companies are using
the format of FRS 3 for their interim results. Others - such as Bass and
MEPC - are beginning to make reference to it in their accounts.
The recently-released accounts of Grand Metropolitan for the year to
September 30 1992 provide a useful illustration of the effects of FRS 3,
which it has fully adopted.
The difference between the old and new profit and loss accounts is instantly
shown by the different profits: under the old system, pre-tax profit was
Pounds 902m; under FRS 3, the new pre-tax profit on ordinary activities is
Pounds 925m. The principal difference is Pounds 12m in extraordinary items,
which boosts earnings per share from 30.1p to 30.6p.
The effect of FRS 3 was even more dramatic on the restated 1991 accounts.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 950m to Pounds 448m and eps declined from
32.4p to 11p.
GrandMet discloses a contribution to turnover of Pounds 428m from
ac-quisitions, separated from Pounds 6.6bn from existing, continuing
oper-ations. This would have been impossible to calculate before. It splits
out under the three categories of the remaining exceptional items: Pounds
13m in fixed asset disposals, Pounds 10m on sale or termination of
businesses, and a Pounds 43m provision for loss on sale or termination of
businesses.
The three notes show substantial changes in goodwill, share capital, foreign
currency exchange adjustments, and revaluations, reconciled to the figures
on the face of the profit and loss account.
In general, a danger of FRS 3 is that companies can use it to throw up a
smokescreen. Some companies are reporting under the new standard, and
blaming it for any drop in profits. Others are holding back from
implementing FRS 3 because the old system gives them more flexibility to
conceal damaging transactions.
Analysts are also noting variations in the ways companies comply with the
new standard - particularly over how material items must be separately
disclosed, and how businesses are divided between continuing and
discontinued items.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Results Season: Captains wary of another false dawn -
Pessimists fear companies may cut the pay-outs they have struggled to
maintain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK MARKET could face a testing time as companies report results over
the next few weeks, or it could be about to see the turning point from
recession to recovery.
Optimists hope that when company chairmen publish profit figures for 1992 -
which in aggregate will be poor - they will signal a brighter outlook for
1993. Pessimists are more concerned that some companies will cut dividends
they have struggled to maintain through the longest recession since the
1930s.
There is broad agreement that industrial companies' profits in aggregate
will have shown no growth, or even a slight decline, in 1992. Profits fell 6
per cent in 1991. The market's concern will be what the results say about
the outlook for the current year.
Analysts will use the results to rework their profit forecasts for the
coming year, setting the tone for the stock market.
Chairmen's statements and companies' dividend decisions will be studied
carefully for hints that the famous green shoots are at last starting to
appear or that captains of industry see no recovery on the horizon. And
chairmen may be nervous about being over-optimistic having witnessed false
dawns before.
Estimates for current year profits growth vary widely, not only between
stockbroking firms, but also between strategists, who take a 'top-down'
approach, and the 'bottom-up' aggregation of analysts' forecasts. In most
cases, the analysts' number is higher than the strategists', even the more
bearish of whom look for double-digit percentage profits growth from
industrial companies in 1993.
Even without much help from the economy, cost-cutting, lower interest rates
and the benefit of the fall in the pound, if only on translation of overseas
profits, should be sufficient to boost profits by 10 per cent or more.
Mr Mark Brown, chief UK strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, is forecasting a
12 per cent rise in industrial profits, while his analysts are going for 21
per cent. He says the gap is not unusual at this stage, but worrying since
he feels if his forecast is right analysts will bring down their estimates
over the next few weeks which could hit the market.
Mr Brown is concerned that an economic recovery will be slow, particularly
as many companies are still trying to cut stock levels, and says that 'one
company's reduction in stocks is another's cut in output'.
The most optimistic strategists, such as Nomura Research Institute, have a
forecast of 30 per cent for industrial earnings growth in 1993. Although
admitting some of this may be deferred to 1994, Nomura's analysts are closer
to other firms' forecasts with 22 per cent growth predicted. Nomura believes
that analysts lag behind strategists at turning points.
While most market commentators expect 1992 dividends to be little changed in
total, there could be surprises from individual companies. Many are leaving
the decision until the last moment so that the dividend can reflect the
up-to-the-minute trading situation.
One such is Pilkington, the glass company, which has a March year-end and
reports in June. It cut its final dividend last year, but maintained its
interim in December paying it from reserves, saying it would decide on the
total payment for the year in June. If positive signs of recovery appear by
then, investors hope Pilkington will decide not to cut again.
Dividend increases in 1993, forecast at about 3 or 4 per cent across the
market, are expected to lag behind earnings growth as companies attempt to
rebuild cover.
Although the hope that the UK has become a low-inflation economy means
dividend cover need not be as high as it was in, say, the 1970s, companies
and investors generally still feel uncomfortable if cover is below 2.
An additional problem for companies with surplus advance corporation tax, is
that a dividend increase adds to the tax charge, thus reducing cover more
severely.
Many companies will be keen to retain earnings to help finance extra working
capital which they will need when recovery comes. Mr Brown said dividend
cuts were still made after the last recovery had started.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Results Season: Change in rulings will devalue p/e ratios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THE p/e ratio dead? The introduction of Financial Reporting Standard 3
will make fundamental changes to the way earnings per share are calculated,
and will therefore affect the p/e, often regarded as the most important
investment ratio.
Once items formerly treated as extraordinary, and therefore not included in
eps calculations, are moved above the line, the FRS 3 eps number is likely
to be more volatile than in the past.
The Accounting Standards Board's main aim in producing FRS 3 was to reduce
the importance of the single eps number - which has become less meaningful
as companies have found ways to fudge the figure. Under FRS 3 investors will
be given, and indeed forced to look at, more information on which to base
their valuations of companies.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, says that, 'in a way it should be
easier for analysts because they will be given all the numbers to work
with.' He points out that US companies and analysts have worked with a
similar accounting system to FRS 3 for years. While 53 per cent of UK
companies are likely to have an extraordinary item in any one year, only 5
per cent of US companies do.
Analysts are fairly sanguine about the changes, although they admit that
there will be discontinuity and confusion to start with. Many claim that
they were already adjusting published eps numbers for items which they
regarded as not part of the continuing business.
Further they stress that the p/e is only one measure of a company, and most
analysts also look at yield, cash flow, asset value, balance sheet strength
and make more subjective judgments such as on the quality of management.
The Institute of Investment Management and Research, the investment
analysts' industry body, is working on a report expected to produce a
recommended method of producing a 'normalised' eps figure showing what a
company has earned from its continuing operations. Analysts could use this
as a base for making earnings forecasts.
This method could become an industry standard, and companies might even come
to produce an IIMR eps figure. Meanwhile, many stockbroking firms are
working on their own versions of normalised or ongoing eps figures.
Mr David Gray, of brokers James Capel, agrees that the p/e has in the past
been emphasised because it provides a simple message to put across to
investors. He, like others, does not expect a move to a ratio based on cash
flow, but says people will be pushed to use a wider range of yardsticks.
At UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Mr Richard Hannah agrees that the arrival of FRS 3
will 'force analysis beyond the eps level'. However, he is concerned that
analysts may latch on to an 'ongoing' p/e.
That is likely to be a flattering number if losses from discontinued
activities, for example, are excluded. And it is often a reflection on a
company's management if a subsidiary has to be closed, and relevant to its
dividend paying ability if a loss on an investment has been sustained.
If not dead, the p/e will at least be devalued with FRS 3, but that may not
be a bad thing.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Results Season: Goodwill factor catches many out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USERS OF accounts can expect to see a growing number of references by
companies to new standards and rulings in the next few months.
Probably the most important change - and the one that caught many finance
directors by surprise - comes from the Accounting Standards Board's urgent
issues task force, a unit designed to quickly clamp down on ambiguities or
abuses in existing standards.
The unit's ruling in December 1991 dealt with the treatment in the p and l
account of any acquired businesses of which a company subsequently disposed.
The ruling says that any goodwill - the difference between the net assets of
the acquired company and the purchase price paid - should be included in the
calculation of profit or loss upon its sale.
In the past, a company might have paid Pounds 100m for a business with
assets of Pounds 80m, and then sold it for Pounds 90m. By writing off to
reserves the goodwill of Pounds 20m and recording it in its balance sheet at
Pounds 80m, it could have reported a profit of Pounds 10m from the sale. Now
it must record a loss of Pounds 20m.
Other rulings which will come into effect soon include one requiring the
disclosure of post-retirement benefits such as healthcare, and another on
the treatment of costs when a company repurchases debt.
FRS 1, the accounting standard on cash flow, and FRS 2, on unconsolidated
subsidiaries, are already in effect. More important will be FRS 4, which
deals with capital instruments and may be released late this year.
The standard will require companies to treat virtually all 'hybrid'
instruments, such as convertible bonds, as debt rather than equity. All
remaining equity other than ordinary shares will be classified as non-equity
shareholders' funds.

FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Results Season: Reuters dividend likely to be beacon in a
dark season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS' near 25 per cent increase in its 1992 dividend, announced on
Tuesday, is likely to be a beacon in an otherwise dark season.
Little change is expected for 1992 payments across the market. Some analysts
are forecasting a small fall, especially outside the utilities and blue chip
companies.
The drag factors are obvious: a small minority of companies are expected to
cut their final dividends and a rather larger number will maintain, in some
cases for the third year running. To offset these dampeners, there is likely
to be only a smattering of 10 per cent-plus increases.
Some of the likely cutters marked themselves out at the interim stage.
British Aerospace had to reshuffle its reserves to enable it to pay a much
reduced interim dividend late.
Rolls-Royce, on the other hand, held its interim, but doubts have surfaced
about the final. After twice holding it at 7.25p - once uncovered - the
prospect of brazening out a lack of cover for three years altogether may
sway the argument for a cut. The doubts are reflected in a historic yield of
nearly 8 per cent, almost double the market rate.
Among the maintainers, ICI seems to be heading for a hat-trick of three
years at the same level. Once it splits in two, the more immediate hopes for
growth focus on Zeneca, the pharmaceutical spin-off.
A profile of prolonged flat dividends is also presented by the motor
components groups GKN and T&amp;N. The latter's vulnerability in a second year
of inadequate cover is suggested by an 8 per cent yield. However, both
returned to profits growth in the first half of the year.
GKN is a good example of the industrial groups which have improved cash flow
and reduced gearing, and so can justify holding dividends even when earnings
cover is a problem.
On the brighter side, Lloyds Bank is expected to announce a 10 per cent
dividend increase tomorrow but its gesture would make far fewer waves than a
cut from bad-debt-ridden Barclays. Its dividend prospects have been the
subject of considerable debate.
Among the insurers, Commercial Union's 3 per cent dividend increase
yesterday, alongside its Pounds 428m rights issue, may well be the best of
the big five composites. Royal, which passed its final last time and slashed
the 1992 interim, is forecast to make the annual total up to 5p. Losses on
domestic mortgage indemnity policies have hit its ability to pay more.
Looking ahead, dividend growth is forecast to resume this year, although
recovering at a slower pace than earnings. A couple of years of modest
dividend rises - say 4-5 per cent in line with inflation - should enable
companies to rebuild dividend cover, which has fallen below 1.8 times.
Analysts are questioning the need to restore cover to historic levels of 2.5
times or more because of lower inflation and the downward pressure exerted
on the average by privatised utilities.
A lower target would bring forward the point at which real dividend growth
can resume. As long as prospects are sluggish, the attractiveness of
equities diminishes compared with gilts.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Taking on fewer risks to enjoy a healthier future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago anyone suggesting that Commercial Union might become the
strongest and most profitable UK insurance company would have provoked wry
smiles in the City.
In the mid-1980s CU was one of the first UK insurance companies ever to
report losses and for much of the 1980s was regarded as the 'sick man' of
the UK insurance sector.
Yet after yesterday's Pounds 428m rights issue Commercial Union has emerged
as the strongest and best capitalised of the UK's large insurance companies.
Capital and reserves of Pounds 1.9bn exceed those of its rivals, including
the erstwhile leader Sun Alliance.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 31.4m for 1992 should comfortably exceed its
rivals.
'It is a remarkable turnaround in seven or eight years,' says Mr Steven
Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, the securities house.
Mr Tony Wyand, executive director, who orchestrated yesterday's rights
issue, said: 'We've managed to rehabilitate the company in the eyes of its
shareholders.'
CU's success reflects the difficulties of its rivals, whose management has
been ill-prepared to face one of the deepest downturns in the history of the
UK insurance industry. Claims from mortgage indemnity policies will exceed
Pounds 2bn, hindering the ability of those companies most affected to take
advantage of the current upturn in insurance rates.
But equally the company's recent success is also a result of a more cautious
management style, which has taken root as the company moved to tackle the
disastrous results of a period of aggressive expansion in the US in the
early 1980s.
Mr Tony Brend - along with three other executives, Mr Wyand, Mr John Carter
and Mr Peter Ward - based their recovery strategy on reducing exposure to
higher risk and more volatile lines of business such as commercial
insurance.
'We always started at the liability end of the balance sheet. We aimed to
limit risk and reduce the volatility of the business,' said Mr Wyand.
Instead CU has focused on building less risky life assurance business,
especially in mainland Europe where many businesses have been started from
scratch. Life premiums now account for 36 per cent of premium income
compared with 17 per cent 10 years ago. CU has also reduced its exposure in
the US, which now accounts for only 27 per cent of its premiums compared
with 50 per cent in 1982.
Mr Wyand, who worked his way up through CU becoming an executive director in
1985, took advantage of 'time and distance policies' - financial reinsurance
policies similar to banking deals - to extend the timescale of heavy US
liabilities from asbestosis and pollution-related claims.
In the UK the group scaled back its motor insurance book, when many rivals
were cutting their rates to win market share. In 1986 Mr Peter Ward, who
directs UK business, opted to cut exposure to mortgage indemnity business on
the grounds that returns were inadequate. In contrast three companies -
Royal Insurance, Sun Alliance and Eagle Star - were blase about the risks of
domestic mortgage indemnity and have been crippled by losses stemming from
the crisis in the housing market.
By 1990 when the heavy European storms in January heralded heavy losses
across the industry, CU was better prepared to face the downturn. Its 1991
losses of Pounds 69m were a fraction of those sustained by its rivals. Last
year while many of its rivals shrank their business, premium income at CU
grew by about Pounds 1bn, increasing (without taking into account
exchange-rate movements) from Pounds 4.11bn to Pounds 5.57bn.
Expansion has been rapid in life business - premiums rose from Pounds 384.1m
to Pounds 705.8m in the UK in 1992 - especially in the market for single
premium with-profit bonds. New life insurance operations have been launched
in Italy (where CU has a joint venture with a local bank, Credito Italiano),
France, Spain, and more recently in Poland and Turkey, where the company
sees excellent prospects for long-term growth.
But the group has also taken advantage of the hardening in market conditions
in UK general business, where premium rates rose strongly last year. Mr
Wyand estimates CU increased its share of the UK motor insurance market by 2
per cent last year, with premium income rising from Pounds 145m to Pounds
213.7m.
This rapid increase in business - especially in the last quarter of 1992
when income from home and motor insurance rose more than 50 per cent - has
strained the company's capital base.
Growth accelerated in the fourth quarter, making fresh capital a necessity.
'The speculation would have been so strong. Market speculation about the
need for fresh capital would have disturbed the share price,' said Mr Wyand.
'We have added the equivalent of a medium-sized insurance company to the
group in only 12 months. That kind of expansion is not something you can
expect any company to finance from its own resources,' he added.
The withdrawal of some smaller companies from the market - Municipal Mutual,
the ninth biggest company, was one of a number that withdrew from many lines
 -means bigger companies are now better able to push through rate increases.
Heavily burdened by their mortgage indemnity exposure, CU's main competitors
are less well positioned to take advantage of the upturn in rates.
'We are now fully capitalised to take advantage of a once-in-a-generation
opportunity in the UK market,' says Mr Wyand.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Lonrho makes Bock joint chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DIETER BOCK, the German financier with an 18.8 per cent stake in Lonrho,
the international trading conglomerate, was yesterday appointed as joint
chief executive and managing director with Mr Tiny Rowland.
Mr Rowland, who has effectively run the company for the past 31 years, said
Mr Bock would have no separate duties or responsibilities. However, Mr
Rowland said Mr Bock's appointment would allow him to spend more time in
Africa while Mr Bock said his expertise would enable him to deal with
'questions relating to (Lonrho's) financing'.
Mr Paul Spicer, deputy chairman, said: 'It should not be misunderstood,
there is no division. There is no split, no potential for conflict. With a
telephone call both will know what the other is doing.'
While the joint chief executives stressed there would be no significant
changes in the running of the company, Mr Bock revealed that the group had
changed its mind over the appointment of non-executive directors.
After discussing the implications of the Cadbury Report, which recommends
that companies should appoint independent non-executive directors, Mr Bock
said Lonrho's board was now looking for 'reputable non-executive directors'.
Although Mr Rowland named Mr Bock as his successor he said he intended to
continue as joint chief executive for at least three years.
Mr Bock said the group's main aim was to continue to reduce borrowings -
which recently rose to Pounds 947m - through minor disposals. With the
exception of the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation in Ghana, Lonrho's
investments in companies it does not control are up for sale.
By way of an example, Mr Rowland said Lonrho may dispose of its minority
stakes in Anglo-American's Leeuwbosch and Eastern Gold mines in South
Africa.
Lonrho's core businesses, which Mr Rowland identified as mining, hotels,
agriculture and trading, would not be sold. However, he explained that
Lonrho did not have to own 100 per cent of a core business. 'The minimum
holding level is 51 per cent.'
Mr Rowland said he would consider allowing Gencor, South Africa's biggest
mining house, to increase its 27 per cent stake in Lonrho's three platinum
mines.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Commercial Union launches Pounds 428m rights issue: UK
insurer plans further expansion as profits return to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL Union, the UK insurance company, yesterday signalled its
intention to pursue further expansion in the UK and international general
and life markets by launching a Pounds 428m rights issue.
The group also announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 31.4m, compared with a
loss of Pounds 68.8m, after bringing forward the announcement of its 1992
results by three weeks.
CU declared a final dividend of 15.1p per share, giving a full dividend for
the year of 24.35p, a rise of 3 per cent.
Shareholders were offered one new share for every five ordinary shares at a
price of 490p per share. The issue was underwritten by Kleinwort Benson and
Morgan Stanley International. Brokers were Cazenove and Hoare Govett
Corporate Finance.
Mr Tony Wyand, executive director, said the recent increases in premium
rates in the UK general insurance market had produced an 'unprecedented
opportunity' for the company.
Many of CU's competitors were hampered by losses from domestic mortgage
indemnity insurance, a market in which CU has scaled down its exposure since
the mid-1980s.
The company had begun to expand in 1991 said Mr Wyand, but expansion has
accelerated during 1992, especially in the fourth quarter.
Overall life premiums rose 31 per cent to Pounds 2.01bn and general premiums
were up 13 per cent to Pounds 3.57bn. Life profits increased from Pounds
114.3m to Pounds 118m, offsetting losses of Pounds 86.6m on non-life
business, down from losses of Pounds 182.9m in 1991.
Non-life business was helped by a strong performance in the UK, where
premium income rose 27 per cent to Pounds 1.54bn. Operating profits were
Pounds 12.8m, compared with a loss of Pounds 85.1m in 1991.
In the UK, CU achieved underwriting profits in domestic and private motor
business (compared with a Pounds 50.7m loss last year) - largely as a result
of increases in rates. Motor underwriting profits amounted to Pounds 5m, in
spite of a 47.3 per cent increase in premiums to Pounds 213.7m.
CU's shares, which had lost ground recently, were boosted by the better than
expected results, rising 12p to close at 610p.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Italy's Socialist justice minister quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S fragile coalition government yesterday suffered its most serious
blow when Mr Claudio Martelli, the Socialist justice minister, announced his
resignation after becoming the latest casualty in the country's growing
corruption scandal.
Mr Martelli's resignation came after he was told that he was under
investigation for corruption related to a secret Swiss bank account alleged
to have been used to siphon bribes paid to the ruling Socialist party.
The party, which now has only six ministers left in the 24-strong coalition
government, is due to open a special two-day assembly today to find a
successor to Mr Bettino Craxi, whose job Mr Martelli was eager to secure.
Last night magistrates issued a sixth warrant against Mr Craxi. Earlier,
Milan magistrates said they had prepared a fifth warrant advising him he was
under investigation for alleged corruption and illicit party financing.
The latest warrant against the Socialist party chief in the unfolding
scandal which broke last February is connected with similar allegations made
against Mr Martelli. These relate to the fraudulent bankruptcy in 1982 of
the Banco Ambrosiano.
Both the Socialists and the Christian Democrats, which dominate the
coalition, last night appeared determined to prevent the crisis leading to
the downfall of the six-month-old government.
Mr Martelli, 49, was deputy head of the previous government and one of the
most ambitious of the younger generation of politicians. His resignation
knocks one further nail in the coffin of the existing political parties,
whose discredit grows almost daily as magistrates carry out new arrests and
make fresh charges in their investigations into corruption.
Mr Martelli resigned as he was about to be served with a warrant by Milan
magistrates which said he was under investigation for allegations made by
witnesses who confessed to collecting illicit party funds in the municipal
corruption scandal.
Mr Martelli has consistently denied newspaper allegations of involvement in
the corruption scandal and links to an account at the Lugano branch of the
Union de Banques Suisses held by the Socialist party.
Although three ministers in the current government have been served with
notice of being under investigation by magistrates for a variety of alleged
offences, Mr Martelli is the first to resign.

FT  11 FEB 93 / Brussels may set steel production targets in move to rescue
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is considering a new role as EC steel market
supervisor, setting guidelines on future production levels.
The plan, aimed at tackling Europe's steel industry crisis, is under review
in Brussels. But the Commission will stop short of dictating prices and
production levels to individual companies, like the 'crisis cartel' set up
by Viscount Etienne Davignon, then industry commissioner, during the early
1980s, EC officials stressed yesterday.
Under the proposals, Brussels would lay down recommendations on production
and delivery levels within the EC for each quarter. EC officials maintained
yesterday this would not encourage a cartel. Another measure under review is
for the steel industry to pool 'crisis funds' for the restructuring of each
individual sector.
The Commission is anxious to place the burden of decisions about
restructuring on the steelmakers, and avoid being accused of manipulating
the market. But Brussels believes it has a vital role to play as broker
between steelmakers and governments.
EC officials said the Commission would make clear it was willing to support
an industry-wide restructuring plan only if Europe's steelmakers produced a
'definite' closure programme by the end of September which could be carried
out by end-1994.
A rescue plan is also dependent on the support of EC member states which
would have to bear a portion of the EC funding of up to Ecu900m (Pounds
730m) to cover redundancy costs. The overall cost of restructuring could be
more than Ecu6bn, according to a report by Mr Fernand Braun, the EC's
special steel envoy.
The Braun report warns that, without a rescue plan involving some early
price rises, some of Europe's largest steelmakers will see their cashflow
dry up or turn negative by year-end.
The report includes a range of potential cuts in capacity suggested by some
70 managing directors of EC steel companies in the past four months.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, has begun canvassing fellow
Commissioners' support and will present formal proposals next Wednesday. The
EC will discuss the steel industry crisis at a special meeting on February
25.

FT  11 FEB 93 / NBC admits rigging truck test: GM drops lawsuit after TV
network apologises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF America's best known television presenters, Ms Jane Pauley, took to
the screen on Tuesday night to deliver a grovelling apology on behalf of the
NBC network to General Motors, America's biggest carmaker.
NBC's admission of wrongdoing came just a day after GM launched a suit for
defamation against the network, which it said had rigged a broadcast test of
a GM truck to make it burst into flames during a collision.
In particular, GM said NBC had fitted small incendiary devices - boosters
for toy rockets - underneath the vehicle. The devices were detonated by
remote control, thus ensuring that any petrol spilt during the collision
would catch fire.
The current affairs programme Dateline NBC had aired pictures of the blaze
without telling its 11m viewers about the rockets.
Apologising to both GM and viewers, Ms Pauley said the crash demonstration
was inappropriate, the use of 'incendiary devices' was a 'bad idea from
start to finish', and that the public should have been told about the
devices. GM followed through by calling off its legal action.
GM's investigation began after a tip that the tests were rigged. The company
wrote to NBC seeking its co-operation and access to the two vehicles
involved, only one of which (a 1977 model) caught fire. NBC replied that the
pick-ups had been destroyed.
GM, however, scoured dumps in rural Indiana around the test site, found the
vehicles, and signs that the rocket devices had been taped to them. It also
uncovered photographic evidence of a remote-control device being used to set
off the explosions and puffs of smoke coming from beneath the vehicles just
before collision.
An X-ray of the 1977 vehicle's fuel tank showed this had not been pierced -
contrary to claims in the NBC programme. And by finding the previous owner
of the vehicle, GM established that it was fitted with a faulty fuel cap.
In other words, the fire set off by the explosive devices was fed by fuel
escaping from the vehicle's filler tube, when the fuel cap flew off in the
collision, and not from a ruptured tank.
But the clash between two of America's best-known household names will not
end here.
It strikes a severe blow to the credibility of NBC, which is already
struggling with a serious morale problem. Since its takeover by General
Electric in 1986, NBC has dropped from first to last in the ratings of
America's three networks. This latest blow comes on top of the recent loss
of its late-night talk-show host, Mr David Letterman, to rival CBS.
GE is believed to want to sell NBC and the GM debacle is likely to
strengthen its resolve.
The incident also underscores the dubious quality of some US investigative
television reporting, which often seems shallow in its analysis and
sensational in its treatment of facts.
Media analysts suggest standards have slipped over the past two decades as
networks have faced declining budgets and increased competition for viewers
from cable channels.
NBC said yesterday that from now on 'unscientific demonstrations' would have
no place in hard news stories at the network.
The apology also gives a boost to GM, which is struggling against a tide of
bad publicity over the safety of its C/K pick-up trucks built between 1973
and 1987. The fuel tanks on these pick-ups are located at the side, and
outside the main frame, which critics have alleged makes them particularly
vulnerable to fire when hit from the side.
Last week a jury in Atlanta, Georgia, found GM guilty of negligence in the
design of the trucks and ordered it to pay over Dollars 105m (Pounds 69.5m)
to the parents of a teenager killed during a accident involving a C/K. GM is
appealing.
Government regulators are investigating the safety of the vehicles, which GM
insists are no more dangerous than those of its rivals. If the regulators
disagree, they could order a recall of the estimated 4.7m trucks still on
the road for modification, which would cost GM hundreds of millions of
dollars and lay it open to more suits for crash damages.
GM's legal action demonstrates that the company will fight to defend its
pick-ups, and will not recall them unprompted.

FT  11 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Abbey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's full-year results will do little to encourage Lloyds Abbey
Life's biggest shareholder to increase its stake. Selling life assurance
products to Lloyds Bank customers has proved far from recession-proof. New
business figures are generally better than achieved by competitors without
the benefit of a captive audience. The long-term argument in favour of
bankassurance remains intact. But the slower rate of growth suggests bank
customers are not all lining up to buy insurance. Lloyds Abbey faces a hard
slog reaching customers in the numbers talked about when the alliance was
first hatched.
With its exposure to estate agencies and mortgage lending, Lloyds Abbey's
earnings might be expected to recover smartly once the housing market turns.
Economic revival will equally help sales of profitable regular premium life
products. But that may not mean sharply higher dividends. This year's
unchanged pay-out is only just covered by distributable profit. Higher sales
of life assurance will have to be backed by additional capital. Some will
have to come from retained earnings. While interest rates are low, a 5.2 per
cent yield will doubtless provide some support for the shares. But the
market is likely to remain sceptical until the growth prospects are clear.

FT  11 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Storehouse
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 10 per cent fall in Storehouse's shares over the past two days seems a
rather extreme response to its chief executive's departure. Shareholders
presumably took the view that if Mr David Dworkin had decided to take the
money and run they should perhaps do likewise. Their nervousness is
understandable. Since Storehouse had previously been trading on a
prospective multiple in the high 20s, there was little room for any trading
wobbles. Although there is no hint of any boardroom rancour, Mr Dworkin's
departure is abrupt and leaves a considerable void. As the inspirational
force behind BhS's renaissance, Mr Dworkin was as much the symbol of change
as its architect. The fear is Storehouse will lose momentum unless an
energetic successor is appointed quickly.
Storehouse has no financial worries after disposing of Habitat and Richards.
Its two main trading companies are operationally sound. BhS has decisively
turned the corner and Mothercare appears to be on the mend. Ms Ann Iverson,
who followed Mr Dworkin from Bonwit Teller to BhS and now has a critical
role in rejuvenating Mothercare, has signalled her determination to stick
with the challenge.
Even so, Storehouse's shares seem likely to drift until the top slot is
filled. Worryingly, there are no obvious candidates in sight. The longer the
wait, the more jittery the market will become.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchange markets had been primed to expect so little from
yesterday's German money market repurchase operation that a 7 basis point
cut in the rate to 8.5 per cent actually came as something of a relief. Yet
it is a sign of the Bundesbank's extraordinary reluctance to relax monetary
policy that it has not allowed the money markets to adjust fully even to
last week's quarter point cut in the discount rate. On the surface, that
looks a singularly hard-hearted reaction to the latest government report,
which gloomily forecasts a decline of up to 1 per cent in economic output
this year.
So what is holding the Bundesbank back? Perhaps it is partly the conviction
that the downturn in the economy as a whole is not as bad as the
high-profile troubles in manufacturing suggest. Perhaps, too, it believes
that only a credible anti-inflation policy will produce the low long-term
interest rates needed to finance the budget deficit at reasonable cost. The
bank must also be worried that lower short-term interest rates could spark a
surge in the dollar, pushing up prices at home.
If the Bundesbank is clinging to these beliefs in the face of a such a sharp
rise in unemployment, it is difficult to see it letting them fade entirely
into oblivion as soon as the money supply numbers improve. There is little
ground to believe that rate cuts will be as aggressive as in 1982-83 when
the discount rate was cut by 3.5 points in the space of six months. Sooner
or later the exchange markets will cease to be distracted by tiny rate cuts
and strains in the ERM will reappear with a vengeance. If that leads to the
break-up of the system, other European economies will be spared the worst of
what promises to be a pretty nasty recession. Either way it hardly bodes
well for Germany itself.

FT  11 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: CU's growth policy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Insurance companies have a poor record of managing expansion. The market
might therefore wonder whether Commercial Union can deliver a decent return
on the Pounds 428m raised yesterday. Having taken on an additional Pounds
1bn premium income last year, the company is moving at speed. Yesterday's
full-year figures show the early benefits of the premium increases which
have been implemented both in the UK and abroad. The danger is that capital
committed to the market from here on will arrive just in time to catch the
next down-swing in the insurance cycle.
CU might argue that competitive pressures will be slow to re-emerge this
time around. Composite insurers have raised over Pounds 1bn either from rich
parents or, in the manner of Sun Alliance's convertible bond on Tuesday,
from the capital markets in the last year. But that replaces only a fraction
of the capital sucked out by losses since the late 1980s. There is certainly
no sign yet of UK rates starting to soften. With so many of the opposition
disabled by mortgage indemnity losses, the opportunity to snatch UK market
share must look too good to pass up. Although expanding life assurance sales
in relatively unknown markets like Spain and Italy carries risks, it might
provide valuable balance to the more violent swings in general insurance.
Judging by the 2 per cent rise in the shares yesterday, the market is
willing to give the company the benefit of the doubt. But the competition is
unlikely to just sit back and watch. By bringing its results forward to
launch the rights issue, CU was keen to be at the front of the queue for
funds. Too many more cash calls from insurers will be a signal to clear out
of the sector.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck sinks to Dollars
3.9bn loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck, the troubled US retail group, yesterday reported a plunge
into net losses of Dollars 3.93bn for 1992 from profits of Dollars 1.3bn the
year before.
This is one of the biggest reversals in US corporate history and rivals
International Business Machines' recently-reported record loss of Dollars
4.96bn for the year.
However, the result had been expected by Wall Street, as Sears had
previously disclosed it would take a Dollars 1.72bn charge for restructuring
its merchandising operations and a Dollars 206.7m write-down on its Homart
Development property business.
Sears also took a Dollars 1.65bn after-tax charge for losses incurred by its
Allstate Insurance subsidiary from catastrophe claims relating to hurricanes
Andrew and Iniki. Analysts had expected a Dollars 1.25bn charge.
The group also recorded a Dollars 1.87bn charge for required accounting
changes, and a gain of Dollars 86.6m on the sale of minority interests in
two companies.
For the fourth quarter, Sears' net losses came to Dollars 1.80bn, compared
with profits of Dollars 513.1m.
On Wall Street, Sears stock rose Dollars  1/8 on the news, to close at
Dollars 49 1/2 .
Income at the group's merchandise group's sagged. Excluding unusual items,
the retail operation recorded profits of Dollars 264.9m, down from Dollars
486.3m in 1991.
Sears said disappointing automotive operations and low overall margins cut
profits. The losses at Sears' catalogue operations deepened to Dollars
159.8m, from Dollars 144.7m.
Last month, Sears announced it would streamline its merchandising operations
by closing unprofitable stores, shutting its venerable but loss-making
catalogue business, and eliminating about 16,000 full-time and 34,000
part-time staff.
These cuts followed Sears' decision in October to spin off its Dean Witter
Financial Services and Coldwell Banker property broking businesses to
concentrate on retailing and insurance.
Sears yesterday reported Dean Witter's and Coldwell Banker's results as
discontinued operations, with a combined contribution to profits of Dollars
506.9m, up from Dollars 363.3m in 1991.
Allstate Insurance reported profits of Dollars 1.17bn - excluding the impact
of hurricane Andrew and the accounting charges - up from Dollars 722.5m in
1991.
Allstate's life insurance profits were down, at Dollars 89.9m compared with
Dollars 165.6m in 1991, but its property liability underwriting expanded
profitably, to Dollars 1.01bn from Dollars 557m.
Dean Witter Financial Services reported a 19.4 per cent rise in profits to
Dollars 411.4m, up from Dollars 344.6m.
Profits at Dean Witter's credit operations, including its Discover card,
rose 21 per cent to Dollars 209.3m before extraordinary items from Dollars
173.6m.
Coldwell Banker benefited from gains in home sales and increased mortgage
writing, increasing profits to Dollars 75m, up from Dollars 26.4m.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Insurers may widen terrorist cover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS may allow 'captive' insurance companies to become members of Pool
Re, the mutual insurance company they are setting up to provide cover
against terrorist attack. This would avert a potential conflict with
commercial insurance buyers.
Insurers had intended to exclude captives - subsidiaries set up largely to
insure the risks of industrial and commercial companies - from membership.
Risk managers said their exclusion could leave many of Britain's biggest
companies without insurance protection against terrorist attack.
The Association of British Insurers said the issue of how captives should
join would be high on the agenda of Mr Eric Coward, a former Sun Alliance
director who will be Pool Re chief executive.

<TEXT>
ANHEUSER-BUSCH, the largest US brewer, lifted fourth-quarter net profits to
Dollars 161.6m, or 58 cents a share, from Dollars 159.2m, or 55 cents, on
sales of Dollars 2.73bn against Dollars 2.67bn, agencies report from St
Louis.
Full-year net profits slipped to Dollars 917.5m, or Dollars 3.22 a share,
from Dollars 939.8m, or Dollars 3.26, after a Dollars 76.7m charge for
changes in accounting practices.
The group expects to report first-quarter 1993 beer sales volume slightly
below first-quarter 1992. This was due to the phase-in of production at its
new Cartersville, Georgia, brewery beginning in the spring.
The beer maker said it usually builds inventories at the wholesaler level in
the first half of each year to meet peak consumer demand during the summer.
Availability of the extra capacity at Cartersville would reduce shipping
requirements during the first two quarters of 1993.
While first-quarter sales volume was expected to slip, volume in the second
half of 1993 would be substantially higher than the second half of 1992,
providing full-year volume growth of 1 to 2 per cent.
For the first quarter of 1993, Anheuser-Busch expects sales to retailers,
which are regarded as better indicators of underlying consumer demand, to
increase more than 1 per cent.

GENERAL ELECTRIC of the US has signed an agreement giving it access to a
promising new technology that could save the power industry millions of
dollars in fuel costs. The deal between GE and Exergy, based in California,
is the latest effort by power equipment producers to boost market share by
offering utilities more efficient power production.
An exclusive agreement will enable GE to use the 'Kalina cycle' developed by
Dr Alexander Kalina, principal owner of Exergy, as part of its
combined-cycle power systems. These use the exhaust gases from a gas turbine
to power a second, steam, turbine. GE claims its systems are the world's
most efficient.
Three GEC Alsthom offshoots have won orders worth DM387m (Pounds 161m) from
Vereinigte Energiewerke, to upgrade the Janschwalde lignite-fired power
station near Cottbus, east Germany.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: SAS and Icelandair in strategic
collaboration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System and Icelandair yesterday announced a strategic
collaboration which will allow the Icelandic carrier to create a European
hub at Copenhagen airport.
The agreement will see Icelandair increasing its Copenhagen round trips from
seven to 28 a week, starting from June 1 at the latest.
'The pact will strengthen both airlines position in their northern European
home markets,' said Mr Vagn Sorensen, senior vice-president at SAS Business
Division, 'It spells a significant boost to SAS's traffic system at the
Copenhagen hub.'
Under the agreement, Icelandair will increase its flights from Keflavik
(outside Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland) to Copenhagen from daily to
twice daily and it will start twice daily services between Copenhagen and
Hamburg.
Passengers on these services will be able to access 30 cities on SAS's
European network and some of its international flights.
Analysts said that the agreement reinforced the importance of Copenhagen to
SAS at a time when there was some sensitivity over the airport's future role
in the context of a broadening of the European Quality Alliance. This is a
loose partnership that groups SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines.
KLM, the Dutch airline, recently said it was considering launching talks on
strategic co-operation with the three airlines.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Ssangyong and Mercedes-Benz in
car link-up

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the German luxury car maker, has entered a far-reaching
co-operation deal with Ssangyong Motor to enable the South Korean vehicle
maker to begin car production in Korea based on Mercedes-Benz technology.
Ssangyong, the fifth largest Korean vehicle maker, plans to produce up to
50,000 cars a year from 1996 for sale in domestic and export markets.
Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest
industrial corporation, said the Ssangyong car would be based on components
and systems from its mid-range Mercedes-Benz 200/300 series.
The car would be developed by Ssangyong, with assistance from the German car
maker, and would be produced only in Korea. It would have a different design
from current Mercedes-Benz products and would not be sold under the
Mercedes-Benz name. It would be marketed 'at Korean price levels'.
Mr Werner Niefer, Mercedes-Benz chief executive, said the deal gave his
company 'the key to one of the biggest growth markets of the future'.
Mercedes-Benz will receive licence fees and is expected to supply the
transmissions from Germany. But most other components and systems, including
engines, will be made in Korea.
Mercedes-Benz said Ssangyong would invest about DM500m (Dollars 302m)
developing the car range and production lines.
Mr Jurgen Hubbert, director of the Mercedes-Benz car division, said the deal
would allow the group to overcome entry barriers to the Korean market.
Separately, Mercedes-Benz is considering assembling cars in Korea from
German-made kits, to sell them under the Mercedes-Benz name.
The car deal is the latest in a series of links between the German group and
Ssangyong. In 1991, Mercedes-Benz licenced Ssangyong to produce up to 50,000
MB-100 vans and 100,000 engines a year, starting in 1994. In October,
Daimler-Benz took a 5 per cent equity stake in Ssangyong Motor, with an
option to raise it to 10 per cent.
Ssangyong currently produces only commercial vehicles and four-wheel drive
leisure/utility vehicles.
Korea's Ministry of Trade and Industry is expected to approve the deal
despite worries that the Korean car industry may soon have an excess number
of producers.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (12): Preparing for the big asset sell-off -
Robert Graham discusses the biggest and most concentrated disposal of state
assets in banking and industry planned by any country in continental Europe
during the next two years / Privatisation in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION in Italy over the next three years is set to change not only
the nature of corporate ownership but considerably expand activity on the
Milan stock exchange.
The Amato government's plans for privatisation envisage total sales close to
L40,000bn by 1995, if the timetable is followed. In any event Italy will
witness the biggest and most concentrated sell-off of state assets in
banking and industry of any country in continental Europe.
This in turn will have a significant impact on the Italian corporate
presence in the FT500. Until now this has been limited largely because of
the dominant state presence through entities such as IRI, the holding group,
and ENI, the state oil concern, which were not joint stock companies.
Italy's public enterprises are larger than any other EC member.
At the same time, the private sector has been dominated by a handful of
companies such as Fiat, Ferruzzi-Montedison, Olivetti and Pirelli, with
little between them and the myriad of small companies - the traditional
motor of economic growth. Almost two thirds of all Italian companies employ
fewer than 100 people compared to only 20 per cent in France, Germany and
the UK. Through privatisation and changes in the fiscal treatment of
mergers, the government believes it can create a core of some 15 industrial
groups of international stature.
On another level, the privatisation process will determine the extent to
which Italian companies are willing to embrace foreign ownership. Apart from
Japan, Italy is the one large industrialised nation with the least
penetration by foreign capital. This reflects both the lack of incentives
for foreign capital and the underdeveloped state of the stock market. The
Milan bourse has proved so far able to raise money on average only the
equivalent of 5 per cent of total market capitalisation in one year or under
L10,000bn.
The change in attitudes to state ownership began with the Amato government
and was set in motion last August when IRI, ENI along with INA, the
insurance institute, and ENEL, the electricity authority, were transformed
into publicly quoted companies. The treasury became the sole shareholder.
The disastrous state of public finances with a budget deficit equivalent to
nearly 11 per cent of GDP, and EC restrictions on state transfers, have in
effect forced privatisation on Italy. The treasury as shareholder cannot
pump in any more funds into state companies. Yet IRI and ENI alone will
require at least L12,000bn over the next two years for investment,
recapitalisation of subsidiaries and debt restructuring; thus they will have
to raise funds through divestment and flotation.
Undercapitalisation has been a large problem, partially concealed by state
ownership and the ability to rely on special transfers from the treasury.
The ratio of debts to turnover in Italian companies in key sectors has
generally been much higher than their European counterparts. For instance,
in the case of Ilva, the state steel group, financial charges represent 11.3
per cent of turnover, compared to 1 per cent with British Steel and for
Finmeccanica, IRI's main industrial subsidiary, they represent 12.6 per cent
against 1.6 per cent in Siemens.
Analysts are split on the value of these state-held assets. While many
companies in the state portfolio have been conservatively valued at historic
cost, the precise nature of debts and potential losses has been poorly
assessed and often underestimated. The latter point was made in a special
treasury analysis accompanying the government's privatisation proposals in
November.
IRI is starting with the sale of its banking interests. It holds 67 per cent
of ordinary stock of Credito Italiano capitalised at L800bn, 37 per cent of
Banca Commerciale Italiana capitalised at lire L1,050bn and nearly 35 per
cent of Banca di Roma capitalised at L1,600bn. The first to be sold off will
be Credito, whose sale was announced in September.
IRI is also expected to press ahead with the flotation of its principal
industrial portfolio held through Finmeccanica, capitalised at L675bn.
Finmeccanica has been chosen to become IRI's high-tech group with mixed
public and private capital. Although the state will continue to exercise
control of high technology through Finmeccanica and some transport and
defence-related companies, other industrial holdings could be fully
divested. This could be the case with parts of Ilva. A piece of Alitalia,
the national carrier, is also scheduled to come on the market.
The most appetising industrial asset in IRI's portfolio is probably the
telephone business grouped round STET. The latter is already partially
quoted; but with a re-organisation of the entire sector and the proposed
creation of a telecom authority on similar lines to BT both the size and
nature of STET will be transformed. The re-organisation of telecoms is
unlikely to be completed by 1993 but the opening up of the STET with an
expanded capital and international partners (BT is interested in acquiring a
stake) could make this company one of the largest within the FT500. STET is
capitalised at L4,600bn, and is by far the largest of any company within IRI
(which holds 38 per cent of ordinary stock) and is 138th in the FT500.
Another IRI divestment in an advanced state of preparation is that of SME,
its foodstuffs, frozen foods and retail business. Capitalised at L434bn, IRI
wants to sell off its entire 62 per cent holding.
The ENI empire is also set for a radical shake-up. ENI was built up in the
post-war period to become a principal rival to the 'Seven Sisters' oil
companies by the late entrepreneur Enrico Mattei. The state is set to remain
a controlling shareholder but with a capitalisation of L7,999bn, ENI
envisages floating some of its stock and reducing stakes in its
subsidiaries. The principal quoted companies in the group are likely to be
Agip, the exploration arm, and SNAM its gas production/supply company.
The first ENI subsidiary to be sold off will be Savio, one of the four world
leaders in textile machinery, and this will be followed by Nuovo Pignone,
its gas turbine manufacturer. ENI's main problem in privatisation is going
to be how to tackle its loss-making chemicals and fertiliser divisions, part
of which will have to be maintained because of their location in depressed
areas with limited employment.
Another company expected to enter the next FT500 will be INA, the insurance
institute. INA is capitalised at L3,635bn and the treasury is due to sell
off a substantial stake. According to analysts, INA is one of the few
companies which may even be over-capitalised. Further down the line in
1994-95, ENEL, the electricity authority, is due to be privatised. ENEL is
capitalised at L12,126bn and 1992 profits were expected to be L673bn. Its
flotation will be conditioned in large measure by the speed with which the
government restructures electricity tariffs.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Noranda to sell 49% stake in
forest group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORANDA, the Canadian resources group controlled by Toronto's Bronfman
family, is insulating itself from the turmoil in other parts of the Bronfman
empire by selling its 49 per cent stake in MacMillan Bloedel, the
Vancouver-based forestry group.
Noranda Forest, which holds Noranda's pulp and paper interests, will raise
CDollars 971m (USDollars 764.5m) from the sale. Its 55.5m shares will be
offered to institutional and retail investors in Europe and Canada at
CDollars 17.50 per share through a group of securities dealers led by RBC
Dominion Securities and Burns Fry.
Besides being western Canada's biggest forestry company, Macblo is to emerge
as a significant minority shareholder in the large Dutch paper and packaging
group being created by the merger of KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG.
Macblo owns 30 per cent of KNP. It said yesterday that it would have a 16
per cent stake in the enlarged company, with an option to raise its
shareholding to 20 per cent through newly-issued shares.
Mr Alf Powis, Noranda chairman, said yesterday that the sale of Macblo had
'bullet-proofed' Noranda from concerns in investment and banking circles
about the health of other parts of the Bronfman industrial and financial
services empire.
Shares of companies in the Bronfman orbit have plummeted in recent weeks
amid fears that troubles at Bramalea, a property developer under bankruptcy
protection, and Royal Trust, which is seeking an infusion of capital, might
spill over into the rest of the group.
The Macblo sale will cut Noranda's debt-to-capital ratio from 45 per cent to
25 per cent. Mr Powis said that proceeds would remain with Noranda Forest,
which has sharply cut back its capital spending to conserve cash.
News of the deal pushed Noranda's share price up by CDollars 1.50 to
CDollars 18.88 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday. Shares of other
Bronfman-controlled companies also advanced.
Macblo, which has been hit by the slump in North American pulp and paper
markets, separately announced that losses narrowed last year to CDollars
48.8m, or 52 cents a share, from CDollars 93.4m, or 98 cents a share, in
1991. Revenues rose to CDollars 3bn from CDollars 2.7bn.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Increased printing activity
lifts Quebecor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEBECOR, the publishing, commercial printing and forest products group,
posted a 78 per cent gain in operating net profit for 1992 and reduced
consolidated debt by CDollars 413m (USDollars 344m) to lower its debt-equity
ratio to 31:69.
Earnings were CDollars 56.2m, or 92 cents a share, up from CDollars 31.5m,
or 66 cents a share, a year earlier, on revenue of CDollars 2.54bn, up
almost 7 per cent. After special items, final 1992 profit was CDollars
87.3m, or CDollars 1.43 a share, against CDollars 18.5m, or 39 cents a
share, in 1991.
Publishing and distribution was up 13 per cent, while printing, the
company's biggest activity, gained 18 per cent. Forest products turned round
to break even.
Quebecor is North America's second biggest commercial printer through
affiliated Quebecor Printing, which is also publicly-held.
It plans further printing acquisitions in the US and possibly Europe.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Minister eases threat to more than 3,000 Nuclear Electric
jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT to more than 3,000 jobs at Nuclear Electric diminished yesterday
when Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said the closure of any Magnox stations
before the end of their planned lives would be difficult to justify
economically.
He was speaking after a report by Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants,
commissioned as part of the government's coal inquiry, backed Nuclear
Electric's analysis of potential savings from closure.
The nuclear industry's critics say the savings would be considerably higher
than Nuclear Electric has estimated. They have used this to back arguments
that the Magnox stations should be closed earlier than planned to make way
for more coal to be burned for the electricity market.
Publication of the report in parliament came as leaders of 11 of the 12
regional electricity companies met in London to try to meet government
demands on purchases of coal-fired electricity.
The regional companies have agreed in principle to buy the electricity which
the generators will produce from outline contracts with British Coal to buy
40m tonnes and 30m in the following four years. However, there is friction
among them about how the electricity will be apportioned.
Some are under pressure from the government to withdraw from contracts for
nuclear-generated electricity so they can take up more coal-fired power.
In separate talks the generators indicated they could not take more than 65m
tonnes of extra coal over five years, even at subsidised prices unless the
government cleared a significant amount of room in the market by cutting
supplies of other fuels. The government is reluctant to do this.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bouygues takes 26% holding in
Basil Read
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOUYGUES, the leading French construction group, has taken a 26 per cent
stake in Basil Read, South Africa's sixth largest construction company, its
first investment of this type in a foreign group.
Basil Read has a R500m (Dollars 160m) annual turnover in building, civil
engineering, roads, tunnel and mine digging, and waste disposal. The
investment, the amount of which is undisclosed, will help Basil Read develop
in South Africa and adjacent countries. Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics
arm of the French state-owned Thomson electronics group, has revealed a 2.4
per cent fall in sales last year. Turnover declined to FFr34.44bn in 1992,
from FFr35.2bn a year earlier.

FT  10 FEB 93 / (CORRECTED) The FT500 (3): Barometer of business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (Published 11th February 1993) appended to this article.
THE FT500, in its eleventh year of publication, has come to be recognised as
Europe's principal barometer of business. The main table ranks the 500
biggest European companies by market capitalisation.
A second table ranks the top 500 UK companies on the London Stock Exchange.
A company's capitalisation is the number of its shares multiplied by the
price of its shares, and therefore measures the value of a company in the
eyes of investors.
Capitalisation is chosen as a yardstick because it has a number of
advantages over other methods. It is a good guide to performance over time;
it gives a proper weighting to banks, whose positions are distorted in
tables based on turnover; and it takes proper account of loss-making
companies, which disappear
from lists based on profits.
The stock market is particularly important in the UK, whereas in Germany the
banks play a larger role in corporate finance, and in France and Italy many
of the biggest groups are state-owned.
Rankings: The rankings of the European and UK 500 tables are based on market
capitalisation at the end of September 1992. Preference capital has been
excluded for this calculation. Companies that have 75 per cent or more of
equity held by one other concern, or that have only a minimal proportion of
their capital openly traded on the market, have been excluded. The main
source for the capitalisation figures was FT Analysis, with additional
information from Datastream International, local stock exchanges, and the FT
World Actuaries Index. The ranking of companies having the same
capitalisation has been determined by reference to their turnover or, where
necessary, their profit. Figures in the European tables are in dollars,
using October 1992 average exchange rates. For ease of comparison, turnover
and profit figures for last year are also shown at October 1992
average exchange rates. UK 500 figures are in sterling.
Accounts: Consolidated accounts have been used wherever possible. When
parent company accounts only have been reported, these figures have been
used and annotated.
Turnover is shown net of sales taxes and inter-group sales. A ranking based
on the latest year's figure is also given.
Profit is disclosed profit before tax and minority interest. For the UK
companies, it is also before extraordinary items. Return on capital employed
(ROCE) is based on pre-tax profit plus interest divided by capital employed
at the beginning of the financial year. For banks, capital employed equals
shareholders' funds.
UK Investment Trusts: The rankings are based on market capitalisation at the
end of September 1992.
The shareholders' funds figure is based on the number of shares in issue and
the stated net asset value. This table has been compiled with the assistance
of County Natwest Wood Mackenzie.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Volksbank hit by bad loan
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS VOLKSBANK, the object of an agreed SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1bn) takeover bid
from the parent company of rival Credit Suisse, has reported a loss of
SFr68m in 1992 compared with a SFr68m net profit in 1991 because of nearly
doubled provisions for bad loans.
The actual loss was much higher, but was softened by the release of the
remaining SFr292m in hidden reserves. The directors have recommended that
the dividend be passed.
Volksbank said CS Holding had completed its examination of the bank and
confirmed its takeover offer, on the basis of three registered shares of CS
for 10 Volksbank registered shares.
Volksbank will seek the approval of its shareholders on March 11 to
transform itself from a co-operative into a joint stock company, converting
each of its co-operative shares into 10 registered shares.
Mr Werner Sigg, a director of Volksbank, said the rationalisation plan
agreed between the two banks called for the elimination of between 100 and
150 of their combined 400 branches in Switzerland and the loss of 2,000
jobs.
While the two would maintain separate identities in Switzerland, the
Volksbank international network would be folded into that of CS.

KAISER Aluminum, the Texas-based aluminium processor, yesterday reported
fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 2.6m, or 5 cents a share, down from
Dollars 27.1m, or 47 cents, in the same period a year earlier.
Full-year earnings fell to Dollars 27.9m, or 47 cents a share, down from
Dollars 108.4m, or Dollars 2.03. The sharp drop was due to depressed prices
for alumina, primary aluminium and fabricated products, Kaiser said.
Fourth-quarter results included a pre-tax charge of Dollars 29m for the
write-down of inventory. Kaiser said the company was able to remain
marginally profitable in the quarter, in spite of aluminium industry
overcapacity, because of cost-cutting and shipments of value-added products.
Fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 496m, up from Dollars 471.3m, and
full-year 1992 sales totalled Dollars 1.9bn, down from Dollars 2.0bn.
Maxxam, the US natural resources group that owns 87.2 per cent of Kaiser,
yesterday reported a net loss for the fourth quarter and year. Forest
products showed a profit for the quarter and the year, but property
activities recorded a loss and Kaiser's earnings slump limited
profitability.
The fourth-quarter net loss came to Dollars 10.3m, or Dollars 1.09 a share,
compared with profits of Dollars 9.8m, or Dollars 1.04, a year earlier. For
the year, the group incurred a net loss of Dollars 7.3m, or 77 cents a
share, against a 1991 profit of Dollars 57.5m, or Dollars 6.08.

FT  10 FEB 93 / People: John West resigns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John West has resigned as non-executive chairman of Dalgety, the food group,
and of Bridon, maker of wire rope and engineered products, having just
suffered a stroke.
Dalgety has appointed Maurice Warren, chief executive, to succeed West, 65,
who became chairman of Dalgety only last September. Richard Clothier, who
had been due to become chief executive when Warren turns 60 in June, will
now do so on April 1.
Warren has agreed to remain chairman for the indefinite future and says the
appointment will not affect his plans to become non-executive chairman of
the South West Electricity Board in June.
Bridon yesterday named Derek Edwards, a non-executive director of the
company for the past eight years, as chairman, and Brian Clayton as chief
executive.
Clayton has been responsible for day-to-day executive decisions since David
Allday resigned as chief executive in September.
*****
John Hogan has been appointed chief operating officer of Lasmo, the
independent oil exploration and production company. He replaces Joe Darby
who recently became chief executive after Chris Greentree decided to step
down.
John Hogan has been managing director of Lasmo's North Sea operations for
the past four years. At 39, he is generally regarded as one of the
industry's younger generation of pragmatic managers who have to weigh more
keenly the financial risks and rewards of oil exploration in a climate of
persistently low oil prices.
He is a qualified geologist and has worked in the industry since leaving
university. With previous positions at Shell UK, Britoil and Elf, he joined
Lasmo in 1981. As chief operating officer, he will have responsibility for
the day-to-day management of Lasmo's worldwide operations.
Hogan is succeeded as managing director of Lasmo North Sea by Russell
Harvey, currently production and operations director.
*****
National Home Loans, the centralised mortgage lender, has reinforced its
senior management to cope with the task of administering its Pounds 2.62bn
of mortgage assets and restoring its fortunes by repaying its Pounds 700m
on-balance sheet debt.
NHL, which came close to collapse last year because of losses on lending,
has appointed two executives who left Nationwide Building Society last year.
Christopher French, who was at Nationwide for 22 years, has been appointed
chief operating officer of NHL. He will take over the running of NHL's
operations in Solihull from Jonathan Perry, the company's executive
chairman.
Brian Murkin, a chartered accountant who joined Nationwide in 1979, and was
divisional director of management services there before leaving last year,
has become the divisional director for finance, also based in Solihull. He
will back up Nigel Terrington, the finance director who now splits his time
between Solihull and the treasury operations in London.
NHL says the change of management does not necessarily augur a change in
plans for the future of the group after it has managed to restructure and
repay debt and work out bad loans in its National Mortgage Bank subsidiary.
National Home Loans lost Pounds 146.4m last year after making provisions of
Pounds 138.5m to cover possible bad debts.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cross-party deal on Maastricht
threatens Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY REBELS and Liberal Demo-crats joined Labour yesterday in a cross-party
alliance in support of the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty that
could overturn the government's majority.
Since the Liberal Democrats and the minor parties say that they intend to
vote for the Labour amendment, a full turnout of MPs would need only 11 Tory
rebels to defeat the government's 21 overall majority and put ratification
of the treaty in doubt. So far, the government has not been defeated on the
Maastricht bill because no issue has united the full range of opposition
parties with Tory Euro-sceptics.
However, there is now serious concern among government business managers
that the amendment might be carried. If it were, the government could be
left with the humiliating task of having to negotiate on the social chapter
with its 11 European partners.
Until now, ministers have been adamant that the workplace rights included in
the treaty's social chapter are wholly unacceptable to Britain. Mr Tristan
Garel-Jones, the foreign office minister, has already warned MPs that
passing the Labour amendment would wreck the treaty because the UK would be
unable to ratify it.
The recent confirmation by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, of his party's
determination to force a vote on the issue, has raised the stakes at
Westminster over the vote, although it will not take place for four to six
weeks.
The opposition parties believe that approving the amendment would force the
UK to negotiate with other EC countries, with the prospect of British
adoption of the social chapter as the outcome.
Tory Euro-sceptics have, however, begun a campaign to make clear that if
their colleagues support the amendment they are not voting for the social
chapter.
They say that it does not introduce the social chapter into the Maastricht
bill, but would simply remove the protocol saying that the other 11 EC
countries will implement the social chapter.
In any negotiations with the other EC countries, the Euro-sceptics say, the
UK would not be forced into accepting the social chapter.
Sir Teddy Taylor, secretary of the European Reform Group, said yesterday:
'The amendment simply makes it more difficult for the 11 other European
countries to implement the social chapter. Anything we can do to make it
more difficult to go ahead with Maastricht is well worthwhile.'
Another Euro-sceptic, Mr James Cran, said that he and his colleagues were
determined to try to find a way to amend the Maastricht bill, but many other
potential rebels are keeping a low profile. The intense pressure from the
whips in the run-up to the Maastricht debate last November shook some
potential rebels, and they are wary of committing themselves to revolt so
far in advance.
Concerted efforts by the Foreign Office and the whips will begin nearer the
vote, and will be at least as tough as in the previous exercise.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: South African steel group cuts
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHVELD Steel and Vanadium, the South African steel producer which is part
of the Anglo American group, reported steeply lower profits for 1992 and is
to cut its dividend.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said demand for all products had deteriorated. He
did not make a specific profit forecast for 1993 but said he expected the
bottom of the cycle would be reached during the current year.
Although 1992 turnover rose by 8 per cent to R1.49bn (Dollars 477m), pre-tax
income declined by 32 per cent to R74.4m.
A sharp fall in the tax bill to R3.6m, from R13.6m, limited the decline in
attributable income to R70.8m from R95.6m.
An increase in the number of shares in issue, however, saw earnings per
share fall to 80.1 cents from 130 cents.
The overall dividend was cut to 45 cents from 70 cents per share.
On the steel side, Mr Boyd said the group had faced poor export conditions
owing to oversupply, while a weak local economy and destocking by merchants
had caused a significant decline in local sales.
Vanadium consumption - Highveld is the world's largest producer - remained
weak, and Mr Boyd noted that the Vantra division operated at only 25 per
cent of capacity.
Mr Boyd said the R3.5bn Columbus stainless steel project, in which Highveld
is a one-third partner, offered 'significant' future benefits for Highveld's
profits. When completed, it will be the world's sixth-largest producer of
stainless steel.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GEORG FISCHER, the Swiss foundries and engineering group, said consolidated
net income in 1992 was 'significantly below' the SFr42m (Dollars 27.4m)
recorded in 1991, reversing a forecast of profit growth made at the interim
stage. The group said its results were affected by 'serious recession' in
the second half, particularly in Germany.
Consolidated sales at SFr2.49bn were slightly below the 1991 level, in spite
of a 4 per cent positive effect from exchange rate fluctuations.
The closure of steel foundries at Schaffhausen and Worms, the sale of the
steel piping business in the UK and the discontinuation of other activities
reduced sales by about 2 per cent.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: EVN wins new Austrian power deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENERGIE-Versorgung Niederosterreich, one of Austria's largest utilities, has
been authorised by the government of Lower Austria to take on electricity
distribution in the part of the province surrounding Vienna.
Acquisition of this territory would boost EVN's annual revenues by about 25
per cent to Sch12.5bn (Dollars 1.07bn) and significantly reduce its unit
distribution costs.
The city of Vienna, which operates Wiener Stadtwerke, a utility which now
supplies the area, said it would appeal against the decision, a process
which could take up to two years.
EVN has long sought to serve the territory, which is the most densely
populated part of Lower Austria. It claims it could provide services at
lower cost than Wiener Stadtwerke. 'We know that the city of Vienna uses
electricity tariffs to subsidise other things,' EVN said recently.
Mr Rudolf Gruber, chairman, said he would now invite Wiener Stadtwerke to
begin negotiations on the transfer. 'I think the decision is very positive
and will put us in a very good position if they appeal,' Mr Gruber said.
EVN shares gained Sch14 to Sch795 on the Vienna Borse yesterday.

FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Changes for an extended family - Anglo
American's reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT EVERY member of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa's
extended 'family' was entirely happy with the outcome of the latest
reshuffle of the group's international assets. But the reorganisation
pleased most of those directly involved as well as long-time Anglo
observers.
The reshuffle involved no less than four companies perceived to be in
Anglo's orbit: Charter Consolidated sold its 38.3 per cent shareholding in
Johnson Matthey for Pounds 342m. A new company jointly owned by Minorco and
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment acquired 20 per cent of JM and the rest
of the shares went to London-based institutions.
Mr Jeff Herbert, managing director of Charter, a UK industrial company, was
wearing a huge smile yesterday because Charter started the ball rolling some
time ago by deciding the stake in JM, the world's biggest platinum marketing
company, simply had to go. It represented about half Charter's market value
but Charter had limited management influence and no direct access to JM's
cash flow. By putting the cash received on deposit Charter can double its
income from the Pounds 6m collected in JM dividends to Pounds 12m in
interest.
If Mr Herbert's joy was not entirely unconfined yesterday, it was because a
leak about the JM share sale forced Charter to shelve the second element in
its strategy - cutting Charter completely adrift from Anglo's influence by
buying back the near-36 per cent of Charter owned by Minorco, Anglo's
Luxembourg-based overseas investment arm.
Nevertheless, most analysts expect that will be Mr Herbert's next step and
he confirmed yesterday that was one of his options.
Mr Herbert said Anglo had exerted no pressure on him as he reshaped Charter
during the past five years. Minorco was always supportive and helpful, not
least over the decision to sell the JM shareholding.
Nevertheless, some close to the deal suggested Anglo was called on to
mediate about which family member should buy the JM shares. Johannesburg
Consolidated Investment approached Charter to buy 20 per cent of JM last
November. JCI, which has a 33 per cent shareholding and manages Rustenburg,
the world's biggest platinum producer, had heard that the JM stake was up
for sale and had strategic reasons for making sure it did not fall into
unfriendly hands.
However, Minorco did not want JCI to take more than 10 per cent of JM.
Minorco has a direct 30 per cent shareholding in Engelhard, the US platinum
market group and one of JM's rivals. One day Minorco might want to increase
that stake but its soundings among anti-trust regulators in Europe and the
US suggested that this might not be possible if 20 per cent of JM was held
by any one member of the Anglo family.
So a last-minute compromise was worked out for Minorco and JCI to share 20
per cent of JM, insiders suggest. From Minorco's point of view this enabled
it to keep a strategic shareholding in JM, even if that stake was reduced
from about 14 to 10 per cent, and still equity account its interest in the
platinum company.
Any threat that the reshuffle would attract the unwelcome attention of
anti-trust authorities was further lessened by the sale of 18.3 per cent of
JM to institutional investors, thus widening the ownership base. Barclays de
Zoete Wedd and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew placed the shares at 456p each with
institutions in London.
Mr David Davies, chairman of JM, pointed out that once the deal was
completed, JM would be 'a truly independent company.' The effective control
exerted by Charter's stake would be removed and trading liquidity in JM's
shares should improve - an important consideration for a company with
realistic ambitions to join the FT-SE 100 index.
Mr Davies also pointed out that the reshuffle would provide a direct link
between JCI, manager of Rustenburg, and JM, which for 60 years has had
exclusive marketing rights to Rustenburg's platinum output. This could lead
to some important commercial benefits. For example, fuel cells to propel
vehicles could be most important for the platinum business in 10 to 15 years
time but would be extremely expensive to develop. 'So when you have
JCI-Rustenburg, interested in new uses for platinum, and JM at the forefront
of fuel cell technology, the two together become a potent force.'
Many on the outside looking in at the complexities of the deals, agreed with
Mr Rob Weinberg, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, who suggested
that 'the deal appears to have been well-structured for the benefit of all
parties. Charter has disposed of its interest in JM at an attractive price,
Minorco has retained its strategic interest, JCI has moved downstream in the
platinum industry and strengthened its links with the company which markets
its products. And the market has picked up a good line of JM stock at a 7
per cent discount to Monday's market close.'

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: A&amp;P target of corporate analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US supermarket group majority
owned by Germany's Tengelmann retailing group, is to be the first company
targeted by New York state's large pension fund in a campaign against poorly
performing management.
New York's move represents a significant advance by the US movement for
better corporate governance, which seeks to give shareholders a greater say
in the affairs of companies with weak results.
Until now, action by institutional investors against such companies has been
led most vociferously by the Dollars 71bn California Public Employee
Retirement System. New York, is becoming more publicly aggressive as it has
developed a computer-based system to track the financial performance of top
US companies.
Mr Edward Regan, Comptroller of New York state, said yesterday the Dollars
56bn pension fund would vote against the election of A&amp;P's slate of
directors at its annual meeting in July.
It would also seek the support of other shareholders for an amendment to the
company's by-laws which would force it to include in its annual proxy or
shareholder voting material statements from large shareholders wishing to
comment on the group's performance. The fund owns 260,000 of A&amp;P's 38.2m
shares outstanding.
Tengelmann's 53 per cent ownership of the chain means New York's campaign
cannot succeed without the support of the German company, and this seems
unlikely. But the state's stance, if followed by other institutions, could
send a powerful message of shareholder dissatisfaction.
It is an accident of timing that A&amp;P is the first company to be targeted
under the state's recently-completed corporate performance analysis system,
which has compiled data on 900 of the largest US companies.
However, Mr Regan said A&amp;P was not only 'an underperformer, but its response
to deal with its problems and improve its long-term outlook is anaemic and
unacceptable.'

WARNER BROTHERS, the Hollywood studio subsidiary of the Time-Warner group,
will announce plans today to launch an international chain of retail
merchandise shops, to be known as the Warner Brothers Studio Store.
Warner, which already has 21 such shops in the US, will open a further 35
new outlets, including five in the UK next autumn.
If the British shops prove successful it is expected more could be opened
next year elsewhere in Europe and in the Far East.
The company, which could achieve more than Dollars 100m of annual revenues
by year-end, is presently negotiating to open a flagship shop in Regent
Street, central London.
Warner is also looking at two locations in London suburbs as well as
possible sites in Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield and Birmingham.
The shops will sell a variety of entertainment and retail items based on
Warner Brothers characters, from Batman to Bugs Bunny.
At present Walt Disney is the only other Hollywood studio with significant
retail merchandising interests.
Planners at Warner Brothers are considering the possibility of an even more
ambitious international network than the 56 outlets that will exist by
year-end.
As many as 30 new shops could be opened in 1994.
The flagship shop will be opened on New York's Fifth Avenue as a 30,000 sq
ft emporium on three floors.
Mr Peter Starrett, president of Warner Brothers' worldwide retail division,
said that from April other US shops will open in Chicago, California,
Connecticut and Boston.
Warner Brothers is the leading studio in Hollywood, having earned Dollars
410m last year on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn.

collaboration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System and Icelandair yesterday announced a strategic
collaboration which will allow the Icelandic carrier to create a European
hub at Copenhagen airport.
The agreement will see Icelandair increasing its Copenhagen round trips from
seven to 28 a week, starting from June 1 at the latest.
'The pact will strengthen both airlines position in their northern European
home markets,' said Mr Vagn Sorensen, senior vice-president at SAS Business
Division, 'It spells a significant boost to SAS's traffic system at the
Copenhagen hub.'
Under the agreement, Icelandair will increase its flights from Keflavik
(outside Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland) to Copenhagen from daily to
twice daily and it will start twice daily services between Copenhagen and
Hamburg.
Passengers on these services will be able to access 30 cities on SAS's
European network and some of its international flights.
Analysts said that the agreement reinforced the importance of Copenhagen to
SAS at a time when there was some sensitivity over the airport's future role
in the context of a broadening of the European Quality Alliance. This is a
loose partnership that groups SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines.
KLM, the Dutch airline, recently said it was considering launching talks on
strategic co-operation with the three airlines.

<TEXT>
STEFANEL, the Italian casual clothing group, has become the first European
apparel maker to set up a manufacturing joint venture in Japan.
The new company, Onward Stefanel, marks an extension of the Italian group's
clothes retailing joint venture, signed in 1989, with the Onward Kashiyama
group, which has led to the opening of 40 Stefanel stores in Japan.
Mr Giorgio Stefanel, chairman of the Italian company, said the new company
would produce between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of Stefanel's sales in
Japan.
The remainder would continue to be made in Italy. Stefanel intended to
extend its Japanese retail coverage, and open more stores in China and
Korea, where it already has a presence, he said.
Elsag Bailey, the Italian precision engineering group which is part of the
IRI state holding company, has won a L35bn (Dollars 23.7m) order from the
Spanish postal authorities for automatic letter-sorting equipment for Madrid
and Barcelona.
The equipment includes electronic address recognition systems which will
enable fully automatic letter sorting, as well as manual coding where
necessary.
Elsag Bailey has already supplied letter sorting equipment to the six
automated letter sorting centres on which the Spanish postal system is
currently based.

<TEXT>
POLAND yesterday agreed to take back refugees rejected by Germany, but both
countries failed to decide how Warsaw could deal with tens of thousands of
refugees once the German parliament amends its liberal asylum laws.
Mr Jerzy Zimowski, Polish deputy interior minister, said in Bonn Poland
needed financial aid and advice on improving border security while Polish
government officials accused Germany of 'exporting' its refugee problem.
But Mr Johannes Vocking, Germany's state secretary at the Interior Ministry,
hailed the agreement as a 'crucial step' towards pushing through the
constitutional amendments to the asylum law, agreed in principle by the
country's main political parties last December. The amendments would allow
Germany to send back refugees who are not genuine asylum-seekers to a safe
third country.
However, the opposition Social Democratic party and the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees have said Poland, the Czechs and Slovaks have no
infrastructure to deal with refugees.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Russian bank and government squabble as inflation soars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S government and its central bank are engaged in a fierce war of
words over who is responsible for the economic deterioration, as the country
teeters on the brink of hyperinflation.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, vice-premier for privatisation, yesterday hinted that
President Boris Yeltsin would take action against the central bank after
accusing it of 'adventurism'. Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank
chairman, retorted in parliament - to which he is officially accountable -
that he had only created money at the government's request.
At the heart of the dispute is the question of central bank independence.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister for economics and finance, would
like the central bank to perform its prime function of defending the
currency, even if it means cutting off funds to the government and stopping
the flow of cheap credits to industry.
He says 'a balancing act' against hyperinflation has 'no chance' unless Mr
Gerashchenko sets targets that are in line with the government's
anti-inflationary goals. He also wants it to increase its discount rate, now
at 80 per cent, to a 'market rate'.
'The central bank should be renamed development bank. . . . they do not want
to act like central bankers,' he told the Financial Times. 'They should be
prodding me to cut the budget deficit, not me telling them what the discount
rate should be.'
But there would be severe social and political consequences of such a tough
policy, and the central bank does not want to take the blame.
'Somebody will have to take the responsibility,' Mr Alexander Khandruyev, a
deputy governor of the central bank, said in an interview yesterday. 'If we
don't give credit to the Moscow power station to pay salaries, the lights
will go off in this office tomorrow.'
The government, whose various ministries have sanctioned many of the credits
to enterprises, must also keep good its promises to start structural reform
of the economy.
While he does not believe it is realistic to expect lots of inefficient
enterprises to close, Mr Fyodorov is determined to do his share. He wants to
restrict state spending, increase revenues and force enterprises to make
efficient use of state help.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (18): Looking forward to a healthy future /
Profile of Gambro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GAMBRO is one of the few continuing success stories in slump-hit corporate
Sweden. As one of the world's leading health care companies, its range of
products on global markets have hardly been affected by the prevailing
Nordic economic gloom.
The company's inexorable climb up the FT500 from 454 in 1991 to 375 this
year reflects a consistently strong performance which shows no signs of
coming to an end.
In the first half of 1992 Gambro recorded a 24 per cent increase in its
pre-tax earnings to SKr396m and a 9 per cent improvement in group sales to
SKr3.054bn. Analysts believe Gambro should go on improving its profits by an
average of 12 to 15 per cent a year through the early 1990s.
The company itself expects to see strong growth in all of its five
designated business areas of renal care, cardiovascular surgery, intensive
care and anaesthesia, blood component technology and preventive health
services.
The ageing of the baby boom generation in the western world promises to
increase the demand for most of Gambro's products in global markets for the
foreseeable future.
Forecasts up to 1996 suggest an 8 per cent annual growth rate in global
demand for renal care products, with a 6 per cent rise in cardiovascular
surgery, 7 per cent in intensive care and anaesthesia and as much as 20 per
cent in blood component technology.
Mr Berthold Lindqvist, the company's president, argues Gambro's present
success first began with its aggressive acquisition offensive launched in
1987, when the company strengthened its share of the European dialysis
market to nearly half through the Dollars 187m purchase of Sopamed, the
Swiss parent company of the Hospal group. 'It was sensible to maintain two
sales organisations for Gambro and Hospal,' explains Mr Lindqvist. This
helped to boost the company's performance.
Three years later Gambro extended its penetration of the vital US market
with the Dollars 253m acquisition of Cobe Laboratories. As a result of that
strategic move Gambro strengthened its interest in cardiovascular surgery
and blood component technology. 'We had been struggling in the US before
then,' says Mr Lindqvist. 'Buying Cobe gave us a critical mass and enabled
us to operate there much more effectively.'
In October last year Gambro became majority shareholder with a 51 per cent
stake in the US dialysis clinic chain, REN Corporation, in a Dollars 78m
deal. A new business area - health care services - is being created to
absorb this latest acquisition.
Founded in 1964 as a Swedish company in Lund in the south-west of the
country, today Gambro is truly international with 99 per cent of its
business conducted in foreign currencies. It now employs four times as many
employees in the US as it does in Sweden.
Mr Lindqvist estimates the company has up to 30 per cent of the world market
share in renal care products, about a quarter of that in cardiovascular
surgery and up to a third in blood component technology.
At present renal care accounts for an estimated 73 per cent of group sales
but Mr Lindqvist points to the large growth opportunities in other parts of
Gambro's product range.
His main task at present is to improve the return on capital employed in its
intensive care and anaesthesia which is not up to the company's target.
Overall, however, Gambro can look forward to a healthy future in an industry
which seems for the moment immune from the impact of global recession.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (17): Recession hits corporate scene hard -
Fourteen companies left the FT500 while 28 slipped down the table / Nordic
region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession hit the Nordic corporate scene hard during 1992. Fourteen
companies in the region departed from the FT500 last year as a result and
there were only three new arrivals.
The severity with which the slump affected market capitalisation was
underlined by the fact that 28 of the 40 Nordic-owned companies appearing in
the 1992 FT500 dropped down the table from their rating in the previous
year.
By far the most successful sector turned out to be - as in 1991 -
pharmaceuticals and health care. In overall 32nd place Astra, the Swedish
company, easily topped the other Nordic entries in the FT500 with a market
capitalisation of Dollars 11.70bn plus a 32 per cent improvement in turnover
to Dollars 1.681bn and a 40.2 per cent jump in profits to Dollars 608.6m.
It was followed by Swedish food and health care conglomerate Procordia with
a Dollars 6.77bn valuation in overall 67th place. It recorded a 197 per cent
profits increase to Dollars 590.8m though only a 4.1 per cent growth in
turnover to Dollars 6.79bn.
Novo-Nordisk, the Danish health care product company also performed well
during 1992 with a rise up the FT500 table to 165th place from 209. It
recorded a 28.2 per cent improvement in its profitability to Dollars 254.7m
and a 16.2 per cent growth in turnover to Dollars 1.407bn.
However, it was Gambro, the Swedish pharmaceutical group, which enjoyed the
largest leap in the table of Nordic companies - up from 454 to 375  - with a
30.7 per cent growth in turnover and a 36.4 per cent profits increase.
But the Swedish investment company Investor also achieved a clear
improvement moving from 260th position to 196, mainly as a result of its
merger with Providentia.
Freia Marabou was a new entrant in 317th position as was the Norwegian
shipping group Lauritzen coming in at number 340. The Swedish defence group
Nobel Industries returned after an absence from the table in 1990 to 426th
position.
The largest drop down the FT500 table was suffered by Svenska Handelsbanken
 -a fall from 183rd to 465 - followed by Skanska, Sweden's biggest
construction group, which dropped from 169th position to 391 with a 12.6 per
cent decline in its turnover and a modest 8.7 per cent profit improvement.
Other notable setbacks were suffered by Norway's Saga Petroleum (down to 332
from 242); Danisco, the Danish food product conglomerate (a fall to 345 from
286) and Unidanmark, the Danish insurance group (down to 443 from 234).
The most striking failure in 1992 came from the crisis-ridden Nordic
financial sector. Of the 15 companies which dropped out of the FT500 in
1992, all but three of them (the Swedish forestry group MoDo, the Danish
engineering company FLS and Nokia, the Finnish industrial conglomerate) were
either in banking or insurance.
Finland's two largest private commercial banks - Unitas and
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki - both failed to stay in the table. So did
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Nordbanken in Sweden as well as the
Swedish finance companies Hufvudstaden and Lundberg.
Most of the leading Nordic insurance companies have also vanished from the
top FT500. Both Sweden's Skandia and Trygg-Hansa SPP have dropped out as
have Baltica Holding and Hafnia in Denmark.
Among the Nordic countries Sweden has suffered the most significant loss of
companies in the FT500. As many as eight went in 1992, reducing the number
to only 21, a drop of nearly a third.
By contrast Denmark performed more strongly. There are 10 Danish companies
in the list, more than Finland and Norway put together. Carlsberg, the
brewers, were the top Danish company in 158th position, a drop of 15 from
its 1991 placing but it suffered a 6.3 per cent drop in its turnover to
Dollars 1,634.5m and only a modest 8 per cent profits growth to Dollars
198.7m after a loss the previous year.
A P Moeller, the Danish merchant shipping company that is made up of two
parent companies - D/S af 1912 and A/S D/S Svenborg - secured 171st and
173rd places. Den Danske Bank returned to profitability but dropped from
184th to 204th.
Finland's representation in the FT500 fell to a mere two companies - both
from the paper and pulp sector - Kymmene and Repola. The picture was more
stable in Norway with the Bergesen shipping group only just squeezing in at
500, having dropped 177 places. This left eight Norwegian companies in the
FT500 headed by Norsk Hydro in overall 93rd position followed by the
pharmaceutical company Hafslund Nycomed, Freia Marabou and Saga Petroleum.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (16): Weak borsa points the way for a fall - David
Lane digs deep to discover why Europe's third largest economy has only 23
representatives in this year's FT500 and why most companies have dropped in
the rankings / Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNCOVERING Italian entries in this year's FT500 takes patience and a sharp
eye. It is necessary to dig deep to find the first, insurer Generali
Assicurazioni at 23rd place. And the second is much further down, Turin
automobile group Fiat scraping into the leading 100 at 94.
With only Generali and Fiat earning places among the first 100,
notwithstanding its position as Europe's third largest economy behind
Germany and France (measured by GDP), Italy is under-represented among the
biggest companies.
This under-representation is, however, a feature from top to bottom of the
FT500. Italian names are even harder to find in 1992's listing than in
previous years. Only 23 companies win places, compared to last year's 34.
Just one third of the Italian contingent makes the first half of 1992's
FT500, while another third falls into the bottom 100 with rankings lying
between 400 and 500.
Excluding Italy's one new entry, only four Italian names moved upwards, none
making dramatic leaps. On the other hand, there were some noteworthy falls
in the generally downward movement, with six entries dropping more than 100
places.
An important factor behind Italy's poor showing was the weak performance of
the stock market. Last year continued the run of disappointing years for
investors in Italian stocks. When the market closed at the end of September
1992, the Comit general index (1972 base 100) registered 364. A year earlier
it stood at 539.
Between September and year-end 1991 the slide had been limited, the Comit
general index closing 1991 at 508. But a heavy reversal wiped nearly 30 per
cent off the total capitalisation of quoted companies in the first nine
months of 1992. (Reset to 1000 at the start of every calendar year, the MIB
index stood at 706 on September 30.)
From L5,200 Fiat ordinary shares fell to L3,460 in the year to September 30,
1992, a drop of 33.5 per cent. Shares in Olivetti suffered even more. Their
price dropped from L2,920 to L1,681, a 42.4 per cent fall that helped take
one of Italy's leading industrial names out of the FT500. (Olivetti had held
375th place in 1991's Top 500.)
The sharp fall in the share prices of both Fiat, badly hit by a declining
share of its home automobile market and facing difficult times in the
commercial vehicle sector, and Olivetti, suffering as much as any leading
computer maker, reflects the heavy impact of adverse economic conditions on
profits. And expectations for the short and medium term are not bright in
much of Italian manufacturing.
Shares in financial and service sector companies were not faring much
better. The share price of Italmobiliare, the holding company of the Pesenti
family which controls cement leader Italcementi, crashed in the year to
September 30, 1992, from L73,000 to L28,350, and the company dropped out of
the FT500. It was 107th in 1991.
Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura also left the FT500, having previously been
ranked 327th. Indeed, all the banks in 1991's listing have lower positions
this year. The ranking of Milan investment bank Mediobanca fell from 117 to
186, reflecting the drop in share price from L15,020 to L9,400. And Italy's
largest private sector bank, Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (BAV), suffered a
similar fall from 279 to 348. BAV's share price fell from L4,510 to L3,095
during the year.
Both Banca Commerciale Italiana (Comit) and Credito Italiano, controlled by
the IRI state holding corporation and now subjects for privatisation,
slipped back. Comit's position worsened from 166 to 250 and Credito
Italiano's from 190 to 261. Over the year their share prices fell from
L4,440 to L2,838 and from L2,440 to L1,743 respectively. (Privatisation
prospects have since provided a boost, and at year-end 1992 Comit's shares
stood at L4,677 and Credito Italiano's at L3,160.)
The positions of two of Italy's leading commercial banks spotlight another
key factor causing Italian under-representation in the FT500: Italy lacks
large companies.
Comit and Credito Italiano stand above their national competitors in a
banking sector with about 1,100 different banks, but they are small by
international standards. Scottish, Irish and Danish banks, as well as Dutch
and Belgian, rank higher in the FT500. Only a process of concentration will
remedy this situation and lift Italian banks to the levels of the European
leaders.
A factor that tells against a higher-ranked Italian contingent in the FT500
is the practice of quoting more than one company of the same group. Comit,
for example, controls two banks that have stock market quotation, the Banco
di Chiavari and the Banca di Legnano.
Equally, industrial groups are characterised by cascades of holdings and
operating companies, or fragmented structures. IFI, the quoted holding
company of the Agnelli family, controls Fiat, IFIL and Unicem, all of which
are quoted. And the Fiat Group's consolidated accounts include quoted
companies like La Rinascente (retailing), Toro (insurance), Gilardini and
Marelli (engineering). Ravenna-based Ferruzzi is similar in having several
quoted companies.
The Italian 'borsa' (stock market) is, in any case, very small. There were
only 376 quoted securities at the end of September 1992, an increase of 10
on the previous year. Moreover, companies often have more than one type of
security listed, their ordinary shares being flanked by convertible or
non-convertible savings shares.
The 1991 year book of the Milan stockbrokers' executive committee records
that only 224 different companies enjoyed stock market listings at the year
end. Only a handful have joined their ranks since then.
An inclement economic and financial climate has been a disincentive to
Italian companies to seek quotation. And the borsa's reputation for
non-transparency and as a market for speculators rather than serious
investors has also been a deterrent. But while legislation enacted during
recent years has helped to improve the borsa's image, adverse conditions
have worked against enlargement.
Attilio Ventura, chairman of the Milan stockbrokers' executive committee,
says that the Italian stock market has made gigantic strides over the past
decade, and that these have brought it into line with principal foreign
markets. 'But this renewal has only partly been matched by revitalisation of
the board,' said Mr Ventura.
Yet the potential exists. A study commissioned by the executive committee,
and published in May last year (1992), found 851 quotable companies outside
groups with companies that are already quoted.
The study showed that the number of companies quoted on Milan's borsa at the
end of October 1991 was much smaller than London, Frankfurt, Paris and
Luxembourg. Moreover, the number was half of that in Amsterdam, Madrid and
Zurich, and was smaller than Brussels and Copenhagen. In terms of
capitalisation, Milan ranked sixth, but was closely pressed by Madrid in
seventh place.
Against continental standards, the Italian stock market fails to box the
country's economic weight. To do so, there must be a substantial enlargement
of the borsa, with a large increase in the number of listed companies. And
the companies themselves need to be bigger.
Mr Ventura, in common with his colleagues in Italy's securities dealing
companies, believes that privatisation ought to make a valuable contribution
to enlargement. And there are considerable expectations of the stimulus of
long-awaited legislation on pension funds. But bad old practices, of which
examples were still evident last year, will have to be abandoned.
Such developments offer prospects for the Italian stock market to outgrow
its pygmy stature. Only then will the Italian contingent in the FT500 be
consistent with Italy's position as a leading industrial economy.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (15): The sweet smell of success / Profile of
L'Oreal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

<TEXT>
WHENEVER you flick through the pages of a glossy fashion magazine you are
almost certain to see at least one advertisement bearing the image of the
soignee actress, Isabella Rossellini.
Ms Rossellini is the 'face' of Lancome, one of the world's most famous
cosmetics brands. She is also one of the most potent weapons of Lancome and
L'Oreal, its French parent company, in the increasingly competitive
international cosmetics industry.
L'Oreal is one of the handful of multinational manufacturers which, in
recent years, has turned the beauty business into a high stakes game of
expensive advertising campaigns, ambitious product development programmes
and soaring research budgets.
So far L'Oreal has held a winning hand. The competitive state of the
industry has put intense pressure on the smaller players and made it very
difficult for the big industrial groups which recently expanded in
cosmetics, such as Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, to integrate their
acquisitions.
L'Oreal, by contrast, is not only the world's largest cosmetics company,
but, thanks to 80 years of experience, is also one of the longest
established forces in the industry. As a result it has had the advantage of
being one of the few players with the resources needed to remain competitive
and the flexible management structure required to respond to fast-changing
markets such as make-up and fragrances.
At a time when the global cosmetics market has been sluggish and other
French companies have been hit by the economic slowdown, L'Oreal has
continued to grow. It was the highest riser among the top 50 companies in
the 1992 FT500, moving from 67th to 36th place during the year.
L'Oreal, led by Mr Lindsay Owen-Jones, who became chairman five years ago,
achieved this through a 19.7 per cent increase in net profits to FFr2.02bn
in 1991, from FFr1.69bn in 1990, on sales which rose by 10.2 per cent to
FFr33.44bn. Analysts expect further growth in profits, albeit at a slower
pace, this year. Mr Loic Morvan, an analyst at James Capel in Paris,
predicts net profits of FFr2.2bn to FFr2.3bn for 1992.
Ostensibly L'Oreal seems well-placed to reap the rewards of its years of
investment in management systems, marketing and product development in spite
of the difficult state of its markets.
But there is a cloud on the horizon. So far L'Oreal has had the benefit of
stable ownership. It is still controlled by its founding family, the
Bettencourts, and has thus been free from the threat of a takeover bid. Ms
Liliane Bettencourt, the founder's daughter, owns 51 per cent of the company
that controls two thirds of L'Oreal. The other 49 per cent has, since 1974,
been held by Nestle, the Swiss food group, which has pre-emptive rights over
the rest.
Ms Bettencourt has promised to retain control for as long as she lives. But
Nestle's agreement not to bid for control expires at the end of this year.
Even after that Nestle would need to secure the French government's
permission to win control of L'Oreal.
However, Nestle already has significant interests in France, thanks to its
success last spring in the bitter bid battle for Perrier mineral water. Mr
Helmut Maucher, its indomitable chairman has made no secret of the fact that
he would like to control L'Oreal. And, as the Perrier affair proved, Mr
Maucher always tries very, very hard to get whatever he wants.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (14): Great expectations begin to cool - Alice
Rawsthorn takes the temperature and finds that while industry warmed to good
economic conditions the financial sector had to operate in a chilly climate
/ France
</HEADLINE>

THIS TIME last year 1992 seemed set to be, at the very least, a prosperous
year for France and its largest companies.
The French economy had, after all, seen no sign of slipping into recession
and was poised for faster growth than most of its European competitors.
France's leading industrial and financial groups were in strong shape, with
relatively little debt, and were well placed to benefit from the legacy of
years of low inflation and win back export markets.
A year later, as a glance at the FT500, shows it is clear that 1992 was not
quite as good a year for the French as they originally expected.
The Paris stock market raced away in the opening months of 1992, but the
CAC-40 Index reached its peak of 2,077 in the second week of May, and has
since fallen fairly steadily.
The CAC-40 ended the year at 1,858, little more than 5 per cent higher than
on the last day of 1991. The overall performance of French companies in the
FT500 reflects the same pedestrian pattern, but it also illustrates the
division between the performance of the industrial and financial sectors.
French industry fared fairly well in 1992 with some companies showing
significant increases in market capitalisation. Alcatel Alsthom, the
telecommunications and engineering group, improved its ranking as did BSN in
food, L'Oreal in cosmetics, L'Air Liquide in gases and Saint-Gobain in
glass.
The scenario for the financial sector was far less sanguine. Societe
Generale, one of the largest private sector banks, made gains, but it was an
exception. The competitive state of the French banking and insurance market,
combined with the impact of the economic slowdown on investment portfolios,
created a chilly climate.
Some of France's leading financial institutions - Paribas in banking, Union
des Assurances de Paris (UAP) and Axa in insurance - slipped down the FT500.
The contrast between the two sectors is borne out by the earnings pattern in
1992. James Capel, the Paris stockbroker, estimates that the CAC-40
companies suffered a decline in earnings of just over 12 per cent last year
compared with 1991. But finance was hit far harder than industry. If the
banks are removed from the Index, James Capel calculates the earnings
reduction of the remaining stocks at just 5 per cent.
Similarly there are clear lessons to be drawn from the lists of French
companies which did particularly well, or badly, in 1992. The winners are
all principal players in their particular fields, with a wide spread of
international interests and, in general, low levels of debt.
Alcatel Alsthom, the biggest French company in the FT500, has devoted most
of its energy over the past five years to expanding its international
activities. After a stream of acquisitions it has built up a business that
now has 70 per cent of its sales outside France, against just 30 per cent
five years ago.
Where necessary it has formed joint ventures, notably with GEC of the UK to
create GEC-Alsthom, to secure the strong positions it needs to survive as a
long-term player in highly competitive international markets.
BSN has been no less active in establishing itself as a force in the
European food industry. It has introduced its indigenous French brands to
other markets and bought up businesses in other countries, notably in Italy.
BSN has even been willing to join forces with its archenemies to secure the
critical mass needed to survive as it demonstrated last spring by backing
Nestle of Switzerland, one of its chief competitors, in the bitter battle
over Perrier mineral water.
L'Oreal has had the advantage of being a long-established international
business in its strategy of consolidating its position as the world's
largest cosmetics company. This has proved invaluable at a time when its
competitors have struggled to adapt to life in an increasingly consolidated
and competitive industry.
All these companies benefited in 1992 from extensive international interests
that enabled them to counter the sluggish state of the French market. The
high level of real interest rates, coupled with concern about rising
unemployment, has depressed consumer demand in France for the past year or
so. The industrial sector has been similarly sluggish, forcing French
companies to look for growth in other countries.
They have had some success in doing so. French exports enjoyed rapid growth
for much of the year and the trading account swung from deficit in 1991 to
credit in 1992.
The export effort was helped by the legacy of years of low inflation, which
gave French companies a considerable cost advantage over many of their
competitors.
But that advantage disappeared when the September currency crisis left the
franc at a high level against other key currencies.
This has not only made it more difficult for the French to compete in their
export markets, but has also reduced the contribution from their
international operations.
Even the winners in the 1992 FT500 have felt the effects of the strong
franc. For the losers, it has come as a bitter blow after a year spent
struggling against sluggish domestic demand and the financial impact of a
weak stock market.
Paribas, for instance, saw its market capitalisation slide last year when it
announced its first-ever loss and was then beset by other problems,
culminating in its involvement in the scandal over the off-balance sheet
losses of Ciments Francais, the French cement company that it controlled
until recently.
The big French insurers - UAP, Axa and Assurances Generales de France (AGF)
 -all slipped down the FT500 when the competitive state of the French
insurance market was aggravated by the writedowns on their industrial
investments and property portfolios.
A similar pattern seems set to be repeated in 1993. James Capel does expect
some improvement in earnings, however. It forecasts that the CAC-40
companies will achieve growth of 15 per cent, this would still leave them 8
per cent below the level reached in 1989.
Despite the French government's bullish comments about the strong franc and
low inflation, the latest surveys still show low levels of confidence among
industrialists and consumers, suggesting that there is unlikely to be an
improvement in domestic demand this year.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (13): Pride dented as corrections accelerate -
Europe's top employers must come to grips with the need to cut costs if they
are to retain their competitiveness and high rankings in the league tables /
Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMAN industry's high ranking among the world's leading employers has long
been viewed as a source of pride. The creation of new jobs has traditionally
been seen as an affirmation that the unwritten social contract between
capital, people and government - cornerstone of national economic success -
is still working in time-honoured fashion.
But times and attitudes are changing. Massive corrections are under way. All
eight of the German groups featured in the list of Europe's top 25 employers
have in the past few months announced or accelerated unprecedented
job-cutting programmes. Daimler-Benz provided the most telling instance:
12,000 jobs lost last year and a further 28,000 to go by the end of 1994.
Similar projects are planned across the the manufacturing sector, where,
according to the Arthur D. Little consultancy, there is ample scope for a 10
per cent overall reduction in payrolls.
One reason for the cuts, which is expected to boost unemployment by 400,000
this year, lies in the relatively short-term aim of moderating the impact of
recession on company results. Other recent reactions to the economic
downturn, which has idled almost 20 per cent of west German manufacturing
capacity and sent business confidence to its lowest level since 1982,
include cuts in planned capital spending of 7 per cent for 1993.
Longer-term, however, German industry at all levels appears to be coming to
grips with the realisation that if it is to retain its competitiveness and
its high rankings in the overall international league tables, it has to do
more to reduce its costs and keep them down. If there were any remaining
doubts, they were dispelled towards the end of the year when Klockner-Werke,
a high-cost, under-sized steel and engineering group laden with DM2.7bn
debts, was driven to seek protection from its creditors in the bankruptcy
courts.
Arguably the most constructive step in long-term savings strategies last
year was the laboured but ultimately successful takeover of Hoesch by Krupp.
The merger of two of Germany's grandest steel and engineering companies,
according to Mr Gerhard Cromme, head of Krupp, will unleash synergistic
savings running into hundreds of millions of D-Marks a year. The
international steel industry has since tumbled into a cyclical-recessionary
slump but this is more likely to delay rather than diminish the benefits
foreseen by Mr Cromme.
Similar changes are being wrought lower down the corporate scale.
Independent machine tool manufacturers such as Gildemeister, Maho, Deckel
and Taub, although so far fighting shy of mergers, have pooled their
international sales, distribution and service networks in an effort to cut
losses. Meanwhile, the number of business insolvencies rose last year for
the first time since 1985 to 9,500 and is forecast to hit 12,000 in 1993.
This latter tendency has not gone unnoticed by Germany's banks. Most of the
larger operators improved profits and their standing in the European league
last year, as they enjoyed the last months of the unification boom, but all
remarked that the risks from bad debts were mounting. A senior executive at
BHF Bank, which enjoyed a 17 per cent increase in 10-month profits, spoke of
a 'sword of Damocles'. Deutsche Bank, which reported a disappointing 5 per
cent fall in 10-month operating earnings after a 3.2 per cent decline after
six months, had already warned that because it was by far the biggest bank
in Germany its results would show the effects of the economic downturn
sooner than the rest.
But it fell to Daimler-Benz to illustrate just how dramatic and how sudden
the slump was. The group, which encompasses flagship brands Mercedes-Benz,
Deutsche Aerospace and AEG, announced out of the blue in November (after the
cut-off date for compilation of the FT500) that due to unexpected
circumstances, 1992 profits would fall by around 25 per cent.
Since then short-range expectations for most sectors' performance have been
downgraded accordingly. Deutsche Bank Research, for example, recently
revised its forecast of an average fall of 0.5 per cent in corporate
earnings this year to more than 3 per cent - a figure which concealed a
decline of 9 per cent among manufacturers.
Yet in spite of the gathering gloom, there are still voices to be heard
which insist that the present mood among business leaders does not properly
reflect actual conditions. They say that while confidence has been hit by
the threat of recession, it was unjustifiably high in the first place.
Optimism had been inflated by the early surge in demand which followed
unification and the related hopes that the collapse of the communist empires
further east would bring immediate and incalculable benefits to German
business.
These voices of reason talk of a 'correction' and 'normalisation' of market
conditions and corporate expectations. Although companies are reducing their
spending plans and their workforces, they are cutting from an
extraordinarily high levels. Total capital investment in Germany this year
is still expected to reach a new nominal record of DM300bn: high by any
standards at just under 10 per cent of gross domestic product. This compares
with an annual average of 8 per cent of GDP in the second half of the 1980s,
a period when German companies were enthralled by the prospect of the
European single market, and when more than 3m new jobs were created. Despite
current weaknesses, most businesses are well equipped with new plant and
ready to feed the economic recovery expected later this year in its key
export markets. As a recent analysis from the Bayerische Hypo Bank said:
'After almost a decade of relative prosperity, the recession looming on the
horizon will not be a serious disaster for most German companies'.
Even though it was slow to focus on the true picture, business is coming to
grips with the painful and awkward process of 'correction', and there are
some signs that the other parties to Germany's social contract are making
the necessary adjustments. Overshadowed by the real threat of even more job
losses, recent pay negotiations and settlements have been calm, swift and
modest in marked contrast to last year's upheavals and inflationary
pay-offs.
Government has so far been less successful. With no signs of self-generating
economic recovery in the former GDR, Bonn confronts the prospect of
multi-billion D-Mark transfers for years to come. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl
has yet to convince the electorate that his cost-sharing 'solidarity pact'
between state, regions, business and unions is needed if unification is to
succeed.
As the Bayerische Hypo Bank report noted: 'The financial consequences of . .
. German unification could prove even more onerous than they have been until
now. It will be necessary to bring about a conciliation of interests between
social groups, and for these groups to adjust their demands to the economy's
real capacity, as moderation is the best guarantee of an early return to the
growth path.'
Realisation of a solidarity pact will demand sacrifices and concessions far
greater than those so far extracted by companies from their workers. But
without them there is a danger that as the rest of the world makes its way
back on to the track of economic growth, Germany could be left floundering
in a social, political and economic mess entirely of its own making.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (11): Going gets tough for the bellwethers - It
has been a mixed year for the big groups.  However, those quick enough on
their feet have had a rich year snapping up suitable opportunities /
Conglomerates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
RARELY can conglomerates across Europe have been through such a year of
tests and opportunities as in 1992.
These bellwethers of the general economy have all had to face tough
conditions, varying from a full recession in Britain, to a near recession in
France and the beginnings of a downturn in Germany.
Earnings in some of their core businesses have been under pressure,
reflected in a fall in rankings from some of the biggest groups. Yet at the
same time it has been a buyers' market for conglomerates seeking to make
acquisitions, so those quick enough on their feet to snap up suitable
opportunities have had a rich year and increased their market
capitalisations as a result.
'There has been a trend towards concentration. What propels this is a
maturing core business, with little growth but plenty of cash. This is what
has been happening over the past year,' says Mr Arend Dikkers, director of
equity research at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. Cases in point
include BTR's takeover of Hawker Siddeley group at the end of 1991,
following which the buyer rose one place in the rankings to 21 last year, or
Tomkins's purchase of Ranks Hovis McDougall, the food group, in a year in
which Tomkins climbed 57 places to 192.
For similar reasons, this has also been a year in which two important new
conglomerates have been formed, in Sweden with Volvo's acquisition of a
minority stake in Procordia, the food and pharmaceuticals group, and in
France, with the controversial merger between Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere's two
business empires, Matra, the telecommunications to transport and defence
group, and Hachette, the publishing company.
Volvo slipped 20 places to 129, hit by losses in its car making division and
the disappointment over being prevented by the Swedish government from
taking full control of Procordia.
Matra and Hachette only sealed the knot at the end of the year, so the new
group does not appear in the listings. The thinking behind this new creation
is slightly different from other conglomerates' acquisition strategies. The
aim, says Matra-Hachette, is to give the merged group the new freedom to
channel cash between different activities. Yet as with some other
conglomerates, the logic is financial rather than industrial.
Broadly, conglomerates in the list come in two distinct models. First, there
is the Anglo-Saxon-style diversified industrial or financial holding group,
a collection of fully- or majority-owned businesses to which central
management seeks to add some kind of value. Hanson, BTR and Tomkins are the
classic examples, but this category also includes such as Alcatel-Alsthom,
the French telecommunications to engineering and publishing giant, or
Mannesmann, the German capital goods to mobile phones conglomerate.
Second, there is the continental European model of a financial holding
company, sometimes grouped around a bank, which holds a large number of
minority or majority stakes as investments, to which it provides little
daily management input. Classic examples include Societe Generale de
Belgique, the Belgian holding group, or Suez and Paribas the French
financial and industrial holding companies.
If Anglo-Saxon-style conglomerates like BTR and Tomkins have been hot on the
acquisition trail this year, their continental counterparts have tended to
do the reverse. Paribas and Suez have been selling non-strategic assets, to
tidy up their complex portfolios, so as to make themselves more attractive
to institutional investors, but also to raise cash to bolster their banking
businesses' capital adequacy ratios. In the process, they are becoming less
continental and more Anglo Saxon in structure.
It has been a tough year for them. Paribas and Suez both slipped 14 places
down the rankings, the former down to 78 and the latter down to 65, both hit
by intense competition in French banking as well as by provisions on their
extensive property interests.
That said, analysts see no clear trend in the performances of the two main
kinds of conglomerates over the past year. Changes in their market
capitalisations appear to be linked more to the sectors in which individual
conglomerates have invested and the individual qualities of their management
than on whether they are organised like pension funds or industrial groups.
The worst performing company in the list, for example, is none other than
Lonrho, an Anglo-Saxon-style conglomerate down 301 places to 478, reflecting
worries over the succession to the ageing Mr Tiny Rowland, after his
retirement in three years' time, and the group's heavy debt service burden.
Hanson, the classic model of an Anglo-Saxon conglomerate, has had a
particularly difficult year. It dropped five places in the FT500 ranking to
16th, after a year in which Hanson gave up its attempt to 'unbundle'. ICI,
the UK chemicals group, reported its first ever decline in annual profits
and lost the battle for Ranks Hovis McDougall to Tomkins, run by one of Lord
Hanson's own star pupils.
Also on the list of the poorest performers is Navigation Mixte, a
continental-style financial services to foods conglomerate, down 70 places
to 230, hit by the poor performance of its insurance and banking
investments.
None of the classic conglomerates, on the other hand, can be found in the
top 60 performers, though Valeo, the car components maker which is the main
investment held by Cerus, Carlo De Benedetti's French holding company, did
rise 127 places to 254, thanks to its uncanny ability to increase profits in
the depressed automotive industry.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (9): When 1+1 does not always make 2 - Andrew Jack
finds many discordant notes in the move towards harmony in financial
reporting across Europe during the past few years / Divergence accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTS of companies in the different European countries have one thing
in common: they contain numbers giving some indication of financial
performance. Some critics believe the similarities stop there.
While there has been substantial progress towards harmonisation in financial
reporting across Europe in the past few years, wide divergences in
disclosure and treatment remain.
Mr Geoffrey Fitchew, director-general of the EC commission on financial
institutions and the law, is relatively optimistic. In a preface to a survey
of the accounts of larger European companies in 1991, he wrote that the
quality of financial reporting had improved considerably. He said there were
also many similarities between the accounts of companies in different EC and
Efta countries.
Nevertheless, the survey showed considerable continued variation in issues
such as fixed assets, pension provisions, foreign currencies, off-balance
sheet commitments and complex financial instruments.
Mr Christopher Nobes, professor of accounting at Reading University, adds a
further proviso even where comparability appears to exist. 'A lot of the
larger European companies depart from their national characteristics,' he
says. 'The accounts of the top companies are extremely atypical.' Mr Nobes
says that many of the discrepancies can be explained - and that changes
continue to be resisted - because of the widely-differing characteristics
and justifications for accounts in different EC states.
He highlights two types of accounts. On the one hand, those prepared under
the Anglo-Saxon system, which are oriented towards shareholders, focused on
disclosure, prepared in countries with a strong, long-established
accountancy profession, and stress substance over form.
On the other, continental accounts are rooted in Roman law, are oriented
towards creditors, geared around secrecy, guided by government rules and
dominated by the requirements of the tax authorities.
There is no doubt that greater harmonisation has taken place in the EC,
driven particularly by the fourth and seventh directives which codify the
contents and format of company and consolidated accounts.
These are now all but implemented in member states, while detailed
regulations for insurance companies and banks are well advanced.
Mr Nobes sees improvements in consistency in the last five years with
significant changes taking place in countries such as France and Spain.
But he believes further progress will be difficult. 'German accounts are
perhaps the most resistant to change,' he says. 'The companies are being
very political, saying that standardisation is too difficult.'
Some are providing greater information in their annual reports, but most, he
argues, are still adhering firmly to German rather than international
accounting practices in doing so. The result is profit figures which are to
say the least opaque.
Some prospects for increasing comparability may still come through the
International Accounting Standards Committee. In the past two years, the
body has been embarking on a simplification programme which reduces the
number of alternative options it judges acceptable in its standards.
But so far the results are inconclusive. The IASC's latest annual report
last summer showed that just 94 companies had made reference to its
standards in their annual reports, including one from the UK. Many national
standards-setters and companies still question the organisation's
legitimacy.
Equally, there is little future in additional legislation from the EC to
foster greater harmonisation. The Commission said in 1990 that it had no
intention of introducing new standards. That has been welcomed by some
standards-setters, particularly in the UK, who have found their hands tied
and flexibility reduced by requirements for compliance with rigid laws.
Among the leading European companies, the most powerful incentive for future
harmonisation or comparability will come in the drive for new sources of
capital which take companies beyond their own borders.
That may force them to compromise - especially if they need to seek equity
outside the EC.
Companies such as BASF, Siemens and Daimler Benz are calling for wider
application of the mutual recognition of accounts in other countries. That
now exists between the stock exchanges in the different EC states such as
between Germany and the UK.
But while the New York Stock Exchange might be willing to consider taking a
similar, sympathetic approach, there is little sign that it will be
permitted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission which takes a tough
line with domestic companies.
No surprise, therefore, that no German companies are quoted in the US.
The result is likely to be a system of 'double reporting', with companies
producing one set of accounts to meet national, legal purposes in their own
country, and a separate set for international purposes. The additional costs
could well be worth the new sources of funds which result.
That is unlikely to have much effect on the vast majority of European
companies, which do not seek international funding, do not have shareholders
and do not even file publicly-available accounts.
But that was never the original point of the drive to harmonisation, which
was fuelled by a desire to protect shareholders. 'Who cares whether grocery
shops in Frankfurt and Manchester use the same accounting system?' says Mr
Nobes.
At the moment, it sometimes seems that calls by the accounting profession to
improve harmonisation and comparability are moving well ahead of the
perceived need for such changes among companies and investors.
But as these needs increasingly overlap and cause tensions, change will
almost inevitably follow.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (2): It's been a moving experience for many - Tony
Jackson discusses the performance of companies as they prepared for the
single market and suggests the most worrying aspect has been the lay-offs of
staff by the giants / European industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THIS year's FT500 rankings show European industry on the brink of entry to
the single market. It is thus tempting to scan the lists for clues on how
companies have been preparing themselves for this brave new world. Sure
enough, last year saw some significant mergers and takeovers. But most of
the big moves in the rankings can be put down to more humdrum causes:
recession, industry trends or the actions (often blunders) of the companies
themselves.
One big takeover which legitimately belongs in a single market context is
that of Perrier by Nestle. Like its rival food giant Unilever, Nestle has
been particularly active in adapting and extending itself to cope with the
more competitive conditions of the wider market. The takeover, which brought
together the 8th and 226th ranking companies from 1991, cost Nestle Pounds
1.6bn.
Another big Euro-merger has yet to show up in the tables, since it had not
been formally concluded at the FT500 cut-off date. The publishing houses
Reed International of the UK and Elsevier of Holland, ranking around 80th
and 100th respectively, announced their intention to merge their operations
in September. The two parent companies will continue as separately listed
quoted companies. Their combined market value would rank them in the low
40s, above Lloyds Bank or Barclays.
Another merged company to rank above Lloyds is HSBC, the product of last
year's takeover of Midland Bank (ranking 140 in 1991) by the Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Bank. This must be particularly vexing for Lloyds, which fought
HSBC for control of Midland and lost. HSBC, which qualifies for the rankings
by virtue of being UK-based, is now the second biggest European bank after
Deutsche Bank.
Mergers apart, a worrying aspect of the single market is recalled by the
table on Europe's biggest employers. Most of the top names have been in the
news lately because of massive lay-offs. BT made 33,000 staff redundant last
year alone. Daimler-Benz is to lose 40,000 jobs by the end of next year. The
other big car makers are not far behind. Some of this is the result of
recession. Another important cause is the increased efficiency resulting
from operating in a wider market, and the need to reduce overheads to cope
with the more competitive conditions which result.
Within manufacturing industry, the sector which stood out in the rankings
last year - not for the first time - was pharmaceuticals. The largest rise
within the 500 came from Institut Merieux, the French vaccine manufacturer,
which rose more than 200 places. Not far behind was Gehe, the German
pharmaceutical wholesaler. Roche of Switzerland, best known as the
manufacturer of Valium, shot up from 18th place into the top 10. Glaxo
maintained its position in the top three, jostling with BT.
On the face of it, this is surprising. The financial press throughout the
year was full of tales about cash-strapped governments around the world
trying to force down drug prices. But these are recessionary times; and as
investors are acutely aware, pharmaceuticals are the classically
recession-proof industry. In good times or bad, people still get sick.
The dominance of the drug industry within manufacturing can be illustrated
in another way. As might be expected in the mature economies of Europe, the
top 50 companies are heavily weighted towards services and consumer goods
such as food and drink. Only 16 of this year's top 50 are in industrial
manufacturing, including electronics, engineering, motors and so forth. Of
these 16, seven are drug companies.
But if the drug companies stood out within manufacturing, they still had to
give place last year to services. The sectors showing the fastest average
rise in the tables were business services and software, publishing,
broadcasting and food retailing. Conversely, the biggest average falls came
in aerospace and defence, construction and office equipment. This will be
partly the effect of recession, since falls in demand are most acutely felt
in capital intensive industries with high operational gearing. But it may
perhaps reflect a longer trend towards European manufacturing losing ground
relative to the European economy, and by implication to the growth economies
of the Far East.
One company of which that cannot be said is SMH, the Swiss company which
makes Swatch and Longines watches. SMH has just rounded off the first decade
of its existence by challenging Citizen of Japan for the title of the
world's biggest watchmaker. Last year it rose some 170 places. Some other
fast-rising companies similarly represented one-off success. De La Rue of
the UK, the bank note printer, which has been a darling of the London stock
market for some time, rose by some 170 places as well. Sophus Berendsen of
Denmark, which controls another UK stock market darling, the diversified
service company Rentokil, rose 144 places.
Among the year's losers, one of the most striking was Italmobiliare of
Italy. This company illustrated to perfection the general truth that
ambitious acquirers can go down as well as up. In May an Italmobiliare
subsidiary, the cement producer Italcementi, paid FFr6bn for a controlling
stake in its French opposite number Ciments Francais. It then emerged that
the French company had lost FFr665m in off-balance sheet dealings in shares.
Italmobiliare was ranked 107th in the 1991 FT500. It has now vanished from
the rankings.
Disastrous dabbling in the financial markets was something of a speciality
of the building trade last year. One of the biggest falls in the rankings
was that of Skanska, Scandinavia's biggest construction group. It emerged in
September that a Skanska executive had been engaged in unauthorised
speculation in the foreign exchange markets. The company lost SKr1.2bn
(Dollars 222m), the boss resigned and Skanska fell more than 200 places.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (1): Swings in currency the deciding factor -
Peter Martin, Financial Editor, looks at the winners and losers in this
year's FT500
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RARELY are sweeping statements so speedily disproved as in the case of last
year's introduction to the FT500. Hailing the 1992 ranking as a 'historic'
one, the article explained that most of Europe's currencies were now firmly
tied, formally or informally, to the ERM structure.
As a result, it proclaimed, 'the factors which decide whether companies move
up and down the rankings largely exclude the currency factor which has been
such an overwhelming influence in the past'.
That 'historic' change lasted less than a year. There was a sweeping pattern
of devaluations during 1992 - involving Britain, Italy, Spain, Portugal,
Finland, Sweden and Norway.
That restored the traditional threefold pattern of influences on the
rankings: the underlying performance of the companies; the movement of
individual national bourses; and the changes in the values of the currencies
in which a company's shares are quoted.
The result can clearly be seen in this year's rankings. Companies from
countries which had devalued by the time the ranking was drawn up - at
September 30, 1992 - slide down the list. For example, 28 of the 30
companies which suffered the largest drops in rank came from Britain, Sweden
or Italy.
Similarly, 28 of the 30 companies which achieved the largest rises in rank
came from hard-currency countries, such as France and Germany.
Currency moves apart, investors' valuations of companies and industries
changed during the year. The FT500 ranks companies by stock market value
(that is, shares outstanding times share price). It therefore avoids the
differences between national accounting standards that bedevil rankings
based on profitability and avoids the inconsistencies between industries
that undermine rankings by revenues. Instead, it reflects the changing
judgments of international and domestic investors on the likely performance
of companies and industries.
Their view of the companies at the top of the table remains relatively
stable: seven of the top 10 had also been there in each of the preceding two
years.
There were a few significant moves among the top group, nevertheless. Glaxo
Holdings, which was ranked 10th in 1990 and leapt to third in 1991 edged up
again in 1992, to second. It is unlikely to be able to make much more upward
progress, in the near term at least, since its market capitalisation of
Dollars 38bn is almost exactly half that of the undisputed leader, Royal
Dutch/Shell.
Another pharmaceuticals company was the biggest gainer at the top of the
table. Roche Holding leapt from 18th to 6th, leapfrogging SmithKline Beecham
(in 11th place this year). All three big Swiss pharmaceuticals groups did
well - Sandoz moved up nine places to 20th and Ciba-Geigy rose two to 24th -
but Roche was the clear winner.
It was helped up the table by a doubling of profits in dollar terms and a
string of optimistic trading forecasts. It also benefited from the growing
interest of foreign investors, reacting to the company's decision to
simplify its share structure and conform to internationally accepted
accounting standards.
Another new arrival in the top 10 was BAT Industries, the UK tobacco and
financial services group. In rising six places to ninth, BAT managed to
shrug off the effect of the UK's devaluation, a task made the easier because
so much of its profits come from abroad. As a group, Europe's 10 biggest
companies by market capitalisation now consist of three British concerns,
three German ones, two Swiss and one dual-nationality Netherlands-UK
company.
As usual, French and Italian companies are under-represented in the FT500
because so many big businesses in these countries are still in the hands of
the state. The highest French company, Alcatel-Alsthom, is 17th; the highest
Italian one, the insurer Generali, is 23rd. Italy's ambitious plans for
privatisation will increase the Italian presence, and may push up the
rankings some state-controlled companies already listed, once their managers
obtain greater freedom to run them in shareholders' interests.
The biggest gainer in the table was yet another pharmaceutical company,
France's Institut Merieux, which rose 216 places to 253th place. Other big
gainers were Germany's Badenwerk, which rose 196 places to 275th; and
Britain's De la Rue, up 174 places to 217th. Badenwerk, the electricity
utility based in Karlsruhe, has been discussing a merger with EVS, another
power generator. De La Rue, which specialises in banknote printing and
payments handling systems, is one of the London market's big recovery
stories of recent years. It benefited from sharply rising profits and the
acquisition of a competitor.
For one other big gainer, Banque Bruxelles Lambert, the honour must be a
mixed blessing. It leapt 164 places to 199th, thanks to a takeover bid
during the summer from ING, the Dutch group that straddles banking and
insurance. But after the cut-off date for the FT500, the bid fell apart in a
dispute over the price to be paid, and the bank's chief executive resigned.
Had the ING takeover gone ahead, it would have joined two other big mergers
among banking sector constituents of the FT500. The UK's Midland Bank was
bought by HSBC Holdings, the parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation, and the merged company was ranked 19th, compared with Midland's
140th place the year before. In Spain, Banco Central merged with Banco
Hispanoamericano to form Banco Central Hispanoamericano, ranked 92nd, the
fifth-highest ranking among Spanish companies.
One striking feature of the list of new entries was the large French
contingent, many of them famous names. Christian Dior, floated in December
1991, entered in 257th place, joining LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton,
Richemont and L'Oreal among the small group of 'luxury' companies in the
FT500. Other well-known French additions to the list included Remy
Cointreau, Moulinex and Fromageries Bel.
Among those companies that fell sharply there was one common theme: the
European property slump. This took a string of British property companies -
including Slough Estates, British Land and Taylor Woodrow - out of the
FT500, and it also played a part in the decline of such proud Swedish
banking names as Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Handelsbanken. A year
ago, these ranked 193rd and 183rd respectively. This time around, loan
losses had pushed S-E Banken out of the ranking altogether, and
Handelsbanken - traditionally regarded as one of Europe's best-managed banks
 -narrrowly escaped the same fate, falling to 467th.
The two companies run by Italy's Carlo De Benedetti also did badly. Both
Olivetti and Compagnie Industriali Riuniti left the FT500. In the 1990
ranking, Olivetti was 178th, valued at Dollars 2.8bn and CIR was not far
behind at 207th, valued at Dollars 2.4bn. This year, neither was valued
highly enough by investors to get into the FT500. Olivetti's market
capitalisation had slid to Dollars 673m and CIR's to Dollars 376m.
Another prominent entrepreneur, the UK's Tiny Rowland, was also one of the
year's big losers. Lonrho, the conglomerate of which he is chief executive,
dropped from 177th to 478th this year; its market capitalisation fell from
Dollars 2.8bn to Dollars 753m.
This year's list throws up the usual collection of surprising comparisons.
Abbey National, the UK retail bank that was until recently a humble building
society, is ranked 66th, two places higher than CS Holding, the much more
glamorous holding company for Credit Suisse. Canal Plus, the French pay-TV
channel, is ranked 102nd, ahead of such stalwarts of global manufacturing as
LM Ericsson (103rd), Michelin (107th) and Akzo (124th).
Thanks to its rapid rise, Institut Merieux, with only Dollars 1.1bn of
turnover, is ranked only two places below Lufthansa (251st), which has a
turnover nearly 10 times higher, at Dollars 10.8bn.
Saddest of all, perhaps, is British Aerospace, ranked 464th, surpassed in
market capitalisation by Spring Ram, the UK kitchen furniture supplier and
by Elf Gabon, the Gabon subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Devonport and Rosyth dockyards to be kept open: Rifkind
postpones submarine decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS, IVO DAWNAY and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday pledged that both the Rosyth and Devonport Royal
Dockyards would be kept open, but postponed a decision on the vital question
of which will win the contract to refit Britain's nuclear submarine fleet.
Its indecision after months of speculation immediately provoked opposition
taunts that ministers are in tactical retreat and paralysed by fears of a
new public uproar over job losses.
Coming after the furore over pit closures and the U-turn on infantry cuts,
senior ministers are acutely aware that the ferocious battle over the
submarine contract will have wide-ranging political ramifications.
Rosyth in Fife is Scotland's largest single industrial employer while the
future of Devonport, in Plymouth, is regarded as equally vital to the
economic health of the south-west. A final verdict had been expected early
in the new year despite continuous lobbying by MPs and commercial interest
groups from both towns.
Justifying the postponement in a parliamentary written answer, Mr Malcolm
Rifkind, the defence secretary, claimed that tenders submitted for the
multi-million pound scheme 'may significantly understate the likely eventual
cost of the work'.
He added that the yards would now be asked to re-evaluate the likely costs
and that the government would also study 'other related matters further'
before coming to a final decision.
Downing Street officials said later it was feared that both yards had
underestimated the costs of building submarine servicing facilities in order
to secure a contract that would save thousands of threatened jobs. No date
was given for a final verdict.
The decision angered Devonport, the favourite to win the contract, but was a
relief to Rosyth.
Opposition politicians were quick to seize on the retreat as fresh evidence
of indecision and uncertainty at the highest levels of government. Mrs
Margaret Ewing, speaker on defence for the Scottish National party, said the
announcement did nothing to end the uncertainty and left workers 'dangling
at the end of a string'.
Both Devonport and Rosyth, which have been under separate private sector
management since 1987, regard the submarine work as vital for their
survival.
Mr Rifkind confirmed that the scope and nature of nuclear refitting work
meant it must be allocated to one dockyard. But he explained that the
government's intention was to keep both royal dockyards functioning as
necessary to promote competition in the refitting of the surface fleet.
For the nuclear submarine contract, ministers had already decided against
the initial bid from Rosyth, which was for a new yard costing Pounds 267m.
Devonport put in a Pounds 162m bid to rebuild an existing facility, and
Rosyth responded with a bid of Pounds 147m to restore old docks for four new
Trident nuclear submarines. Devonport said it could do the equivalent work
for Pounds 131m.
The refitting contract would mean work for the next 30 years for the chosen
docks, and support Devonport's workforce of 5,000 or Rosyth's of 4,000.
Mr Mike Leece, managing director of DML, the consortium which runs
Devonport, said the yard was 'seriously disappointed' by the delay.
Babcock Thorn, which manages Rosyth, said the decision was 'as good as far
as it goes', but the battle to win the Trident contract would continue.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Germany urged to restore 40-hour week

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING German industrialist sought yesterday to reverse the trend to
shorter working hours and called for the return of the 40-hour week.
Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German chambers of industry and
commerce, said Germany had the shortest working times, the longest holidays
and the youngest pensioners.
Moves to shorten the German working week are still taking place despite
growing unemployment. Engineering workers, for example, are due this year to
cut their working week from 37 to 36 hours.
Mr Stihl conceded that unions would probably block a return to a 40-hour
week, but said there was more chance that of getting Germans to retire
later.
'Retirement under 60 must become a thing of the past. Otherwise Germany will
be sent into retirement in terms of international competition,' Mr Stihl
added.
Meanwhile, the German government yesterday told employers that its
solidarity pact for east Germany was on course, with a supplementary budget
and savings package ready to become law by the middle of the year.
Mr Friedrich Bohl, minister of state in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office,
sought to reassure members of the German employers' federation (BDA) that
negotiations with the 16 federal states could produce a deal on sharing the
burden of subsidies to the east by the middle of March.
The financial agreement between the central government and the federal
states is the most complex item still to be finalised in the proposed
solidarity pact. The other major element where agreement is outstanding is a
deal with trade unions to slow down the growth of wages in east Germany.

FT  10 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED speculation about a big rights issue, coupled with a poor outlook
for the UK economy, led to consistent selling in the futures, writes Joel
kibazo.
Signs of what lay in store for the rest of the session were much in evidence
when trading in the March contract on the FT-SE opened 5 points below
Monday's close of 2,874.
Independent traders started selling the contract right at the start of
business as the talk of an impending rights issue intensified. They were
later joined by two of London's leading securities houses. The continued
weakness of sterling and a mixed set of economic data not only sent March
falling further but also helped to pull the underlying cash market lower.
The afternoon only brought more selling as dealers focused on a poor Wall
Street opening, and the contract fell to the day's low point of 2,813
half-an-hour before the close.
It was then that short covering by several traders led to a turnround in the
fortunes of March and it recovered some of the earlier drop. It ended at
2,833, a fall of 41 from Monday's close. Strong arbitrage activity
throughout the session resulted in good turnover of 12,092 lots.
The traded options saw volume of 35,247 contracts, of which 11,292 were
dealt in the FT-SE 100 option contract and 2,783 lots in the Euro-FT-SE 100
contract. British Steel was the most active stock option.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (30): Drop-outs show change in fortunes - High
real interest rates, a fall-off in demand and an increase in supply have
taken their toll in one of the worst hit sectors / Property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY is one of the worst hit sectors in the latest survey of Europe's
top 500 companies, reflecting the industry's sharp reversal of fortunes
since 1991.
In the 12 months to last September, the number of property companies in the
FT500 fell from 14 to just five, as high real interest rates, a fall-off in
demand and an increase in supply took their toll.
Deflation has followed a decade of soaring values. In the five years to
1990, rapidly increasing occupier demand and low vacancy rates drove average
office rents in Europe up by an average of 14 per cent a year and capital
values up by 18 per cent a year, according to Jones Lang Wootton, property
consultants.
After peaking in the first quarter of 1991, Europe's office rents fell by an
average of 11 per cent from their peak; capital values fell by an average of
23 per cent.
But the timing of the decline has varied significantly between cities.
Starting in London in late 1989, the property recession has rolled its way
around Europe, and has now reached Germany, hitherto the strongest of
Europe's large property markets. Only a handful of markets, such as Brussels
and Hamburg, bucked the trend and increased office rents in 1992.
A casual glance at FT500 ratings can provide only a partial guide to the
strengths and weaknesses of Europe's property markets.
For example, Germany, one of Europe's most important property markets, has
no representation, as property is largely in private hands.
Moreover, the UK and France, two of the worst hit markets in Europe, are
still the best represented countries in the FT500, each with two property
companies. The French companies, which are in the relatively robust
residential sector, actually improved their rankings. Likewise, Rodamco, the
Dutch property concern which is the largest property company in Europe, has
gone up in the rankings from 132 to 130. Even though it has large exposures
to some of the worst affected property markets in the world such as the US,
the UK and France, its large cash reserves lent it some resilience.
As well as difficulties in comparing Europe's property companies,
generalising about Europe's property markets is complicated by the different
structures of each countries' property markets and the predominantly local
factors that govern them.
Nonetheless, there are several common causes of the escalation of property
prices across Europe, and their later collapse.
One of the factors influencing the rise in rents in most European capitals
was the rapid expansion of corporate activity ahead of the creation of a
barrier-free European market in 1993. At a time when the expansion of
international companies has slowed, markets are driven by mainly domestic
companies which are looking carefully at their costs.
Likewise, there was a sharp upturn in international investment at the end of
the 1980s, as funds flowed into the European Community, particularly from
Japan and Sweden, and investment restrictions were lifted within EC
countries. But international investors largely retreated as recession bit
and they became burdened with problems in their home markets.
The surge in rents and investment triggered an upturn in construction,
encouraged in several cities by a relaxation of planning rules. Across
Europe, office vacancies rose to 6 per cent and are expected to rise further
during 1993, according to Jones Lang Wootton.
The UK commercial property market, which has experienced one of the longest
and deepest recessions in Europe, has seen the greatest decline of any
country in its representation in the FT500. Three companies, Hammerson,
Slough Estates and British Land, have left. Only the UK's two largest
property companies, Land Securities and MEPC still make the grade.
Most UK property companies are heavily exposed to offices, the
worst-affected market, which has seen values halve in the past three years.
As they mostly entered the downturn with relatively high gearing, their
market capitalisations have fallen drastically over the past three years.
That said, sterling's departure from the exchange rate mechanism, which
lowered interest rates and heralded potentially higher inflation pushed
property shares up by 30 per cent.
Whereas the London office market may be over the worst of its decline,
concern about Paris is intensifying. Rents have fallen sharply and are
likely to continue to do so as the supply of office space coming on to the
market peaks next year.
Now the government has been asked to put forward some measures to support
the market, by the insurance companies and banks, which have been forced to
make heavy provisions on their loans to property developers.
The ravaged state of the French commercial property market is not evident
from the performance of its largest property companies. The only French
company to drop out is Unibail, which has four-fifths of its portfolio in
the office sector.
The remaining French companies went up in the rankings. Sefimeg, for which
residential property accounts for three quarters of its portfolio, went up
from 369 to 343.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (31): Improvement in 1993 unlikely - Overcapacity
has been the main villain in a story of falling prices and reduced profits /
Paper and pulp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Europe's leading paper and pulp groups 1992 was a tale of overcapacity,
falling prices and reduced profits. Small wonder that so few of them managed
to improve their position in the FT500 and that most of them slipped further
down the table.
Indeed, the fact that only nine paper and pulp groups even make the FT500 is
a clear enough indication of an industry going through difficult times.
There were no new entrants to the table in 1992, while one company, the
Swedish group Mo och Domsjo (MoDo), fell out of the rankings. Judging by the
fact that a further two companies, Germany's PWA and Sweden's Korsnas, only
scrape in at 490 and 493 respectively, the list could be even shorter next
year.
So why are things so bad? Overcapacity, following the big investment
programmes of the late 1980s, has been the main villain of the piece. Added
to this have been weak conditions in many key European markets and a weak
dollar that brought an increased flow of North American imports into Europe.
Finally, there has been the impact of high interest rates on balance sheets
groaning under the weight of past investments and acquisitions.
None suffered more than the Swedes, though with three pulp and paper
companies in the FT500 they still boast more than any other country. For
much of the year they carried the additional burden of a strong krona, which
meant they were uncompetitive against rival Finnish and North American
groups.
All three of the Swedish groups slid down the table - Stora from 162 to 213,
Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolag (SCA) from 175 to 185 and Korsnas from 453 to
493. The changes pushed SCA ahead of Stora as Sweden's leading forestry
group in terms of market capitalisation even though the latter, in output
terms, is regarded as Europe's leading pulp and paper company.
The irony is that their prospects have been transformed as a result of the
devaluation which has followed Sweden's decision to float the krona on
November 19, a factor reflected in the strong performance of pulp and paper
shares on the Stockholm Stock Exchange since then. This has had an immediate
impact. SCA, which had been expecting a break-even result when it published
its eight-month figures, said in December it expected a 1992 profit of some
SKr300-400m, partly because of the favourable currency movement.
Stora, which posted a SKr380m loss in the first eight months, will still
make a loss for the full year, but the devaluation effect and its extensive
rationalisation programme holds it in good stead for 1993. Reflecting this
confidence, the group announced new investments of some SKr1.4bn in the
autumn.
The Finnish pulp and paper groups did not fare much better in 1992, even
though the markka was first devalued in November 1991 and then floated in
September last year to give an overall devaluation of 25 per cent. Only one
Finnish forestry group, Kymmene, actually made the top 500, coming in at a
lowly 381, down just one notch from last year. It was lucky to fare as well
as that, given that it slumped from profits of Dollars 81.7m to a loss of
Dollars 111m year on year.
Elsewhere, the UK's Bowater Industries, the packaging and printing group
(which no longer sits particularly comfortably alongside the other pulp and
paper companies), was conspicuous, simply because it advanced more than 100
places from 266 to 157 with a capitalisation approaching the Dollars 3bn
mark. Profits eased slightly, but this was still considered a resilient
performance in a recession. At the same time the company launched a share
issue to help fund two acquisitions, DRG Packaging and Cope Allman
Packaging.
The other leading UK paper group, Arjo Wiggins Appleton, saw its ranking
slip from 124 to 202, as profits fell back to Dollars 382.6m. The group
parted company with its chief executive, Stephen Walls, and it cut its
interim dividend. The company's main paper types, carbonless and coated wood
free, both struggled in the general paper market downturn.
The year was characterised by subdued mergers and acquisitions activity
after the binge of the late 1980s. The most significant move came in
December when the three Dutch groups, KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG joined
forces to create a company with annual sales of about Fl 13bn and a market
capitalisation of more than Fl 2.3bn.
KNP was the only one of the three with an FT500 ranking, which stood at 384
in 1992. However, the merged entity will be the second largest paper and
packaging group in Europe, by total group turnover - smaller than Stora but
larger than SCA and Arjo Wiggins Appleton.
Otherwise, stretched balance sheets and depressed share prices restricted
the funding possibilities for those anxious to go on the corporate expansion
trail.
Next year may be little different, given that there is no sign of a
recovery. The first six months of 1993 do not promise much respite because
demand will continue to be weak in many European markets. 'The optimists are
looking at the second half of 1993 for some improvement, while the
pessimists think 1993 may be as bad as 1992,' says David Clark, managing
director of the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI).

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (28): Rough ride for car makers - Overcapacity is
being exacerbated by the development of new plants by Japanese and
traditional European producers / Motor industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN car makers suffered a tough ride in the equity markets in the
second half of 1992 as investors began to focus on the difficult outlook for
car sales in 1993. The share prices of the quoted volume car makers
Volkswagen of Germany, Peugeot of France and Fiat of Italy all plunged in
the final months of 1992, as industry forecasts of declining new car demand
in western Europe became widespread.
By 1993 most vehicle makers were facing extended periods of short-time
working, profit margins were being squeezed and several car producers from
Volvo and Saab in Sweden to Jaguar, Ford of Europe and Porsche, as well as
truck makers such as Daf, Volvo, Iveco (Fiat) and Renault Vehicules
Industriels were in loss.
The problem of overcapacity is being exacerbated by the development of
several new plants by Japanese car makers and by the traditional European
producers.
The generally bearish sentiments towards the volume car makers have also
served to depress the share prices of the leading executive and luxury car
makers Daimler-Benz and BMW, although BMW's much stronger performance in the
market-place has helped to cushion the fall in its share price. In 1992, BMW
outsold Mercedes-Benz in western Europe and in the US for the first time in
its history. Mercedes-Benz is also facing a steep fall in orders for new
commercial vehicles in Germany.
All the leading quoted European car makers have lost ground in the FT500.
Fiat was the most notable casualty dropping from 53rd to 94th in 1992, but
Volkswagen has also fallen nine places to end up only slightly above Fiat at
87 in the list.
Three of the leading volume car makers in Europe do not appear in the FT500.
GM Europe and Ford of Europe are both wholly-owned by the US car makers,
while the ownership of Renault is still dominated by the French state, which
holds an 80 per cent stake. The remaining 20 per cent is held by Volvo of
Sweden, Renault's partner in the far-reaching Franco-Swedish alliance.
Renault has been actively cultivating the financial markets during the past
year, however, and part of its equity could be floated eventually in the
wake of the French general election in March. Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault
chairman and chief executive, is keen to deepen the existing alliance with
Volvo, possibly into a full merger.
While the vehicle makers have fallen from favour among investors, the
automotive components suppliers have generally fared much better, although
Pirelli and Continental, the Italian and German tyre makers, suffered a fall
in their share prices in the last three months of 1992.
By contrast Michelin, the French tyre maker, has held on to the impressive
gains it made in the 18 months to the summer of 1992. Its share price has
since marked time, but after the powerful recovery from a low of FFr58 in
October 1990, Michelin has climbed more than 100 places in the FT500 to
reach 107 in the list from 211 a year earlier.
Valeo, the leading French automotive components maker, has also emerged
strongly ahead of the pack during the past two years. It has jumped to 254
in the FT500 from 381 a year earlier, and analysts forecast that Valeo
should continue to have more resilient earnings than most components
suppliers in Europe in 1993.
According to Mr Nick Snee, automotive analyst at SG Warburg in London, Valeo
has market share leadership in many of its products, which should give it
some ability to resist pricing pressures, as the vehicle assemblers squeeze
prices in the face of declining volumes.
At the same time Valeo 'took the decision at an early stage to cut costs,
which is why its margins have risen over the last 18 months, while other
suppliers have seen margins fall', says Mr Snee. Valeo is also in a phase of
reducing its indebtedness after heavy investments in earlier years, which
should also help to cushion its profits against the impact of falling sales
volumes.
New car sales staged an unexpected rally in December in several of the main
volume markets in western Europe confounding leading car makers' more
pessimistic forecasts. As a result new car sales in western Europe for the
whole of 1992 were virtually unchanged from the previous year at 13.5m.
The industry remains pessimistic about the outlook for new car sales in
1993, however, with most forecasts suggesting a decline of around 4 per
cent.
New car sales in western Europe have remained stable around 13.5m for the
past four years to 1992, although the fortunes of individual markets - and
therefore of individual car makers - have fluctuated greatly. Sales have
only been kept at this record level, however, by the expansion of the
western European market to include eastern Germany since mid-1990, as a
result of reunification, which has helped to compensate for falls elsewhere.
The starkest contrast in the fortunes of individual markets has been between
the UK and Germany. New car sales have fallen by nearly a third in the UK in
the face of the deep recession from the peak of 2.3m units in 1989 to only
1.59m in both 1991 and 1992. In Germany, where demand received an
unprecedented boost from reunification, sales jumped by 46.9 per cent from
2.83m in West Germany in 1989 to 4.16m in unified Germany in 1991.
The Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, has
established a convincing lead in the western European new car sales league.
It was the best-selling car maker in western Europe in 1992 for the eighth
year in succession. It boosted its market share to a record 17.5 per cent
from 16.4 per cent a year earlier and established a commanding lead ahead of
its nearest rival General Motors of the US.
As the German market weakens this year VW's deep-rooted cost problems are
becoming more apparent, however. According to a recent SG Warburg report on
the world auto industry unit productivity at Volkswagen's domestic plants is
no better than that achieved by its leading European rivals such as Peugeot
and Renault in France, but its hourly labour costs are substantially higher
and still rising.
VW is finding it increasingly difficult to secure premium prices, and SG
Warburg warns that 'unless VW can cut its cost-base, it faces a protracted
period of inferior operating returns, at a time when its ambitious expansion
programme has reduced financial income'.
Fiat of Italy, which includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo and Ferrari, has been the
main loser among the big six volume car makers in western Europe, however.
It has slipped from second to fourth place behind VW, GM and the Peugeot
group of France, which includes Citroen.
Fiat's sales volume in western Europe fell by an estimated 7.4 per cent to
1.6m last year following an 8.1 per cent decline in 1991 and a 6 per cent
fall in 1990. Its market share fell to only 11.9 per cent from 12.8 per cent
in 1991, 14.2 per cent in 1990 and 14.9 per cent in 1989.
In the market for executive and luxury cars in western Europe BMW of Germany
outsold its arch domestic rival Mercedes-Benz for the first time in its
history. BMW increased its sales by 7.2 per cent to around 443,000, while
Mercedes-Benz was among the biggest losers last year with an estimated 8.6
per cent drop in sales to 413,000.
With the market in western Europe weakening in 1993 Europe's hard-pressed
luxury car makers can expect some relief from North America this year,
however, where sales are beginning to recover from recession. In a virtually
flat US car market last last year BMW increased its sales by 23.1 per cent
to 65,691, while Mercedes-Benz raised its sales by 7.5 per cent to 63,312.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (29): Wonder stocks lose a little glamour - Paul
Abrahams ponders whether the charmed status enjoyed until now by
pharmaceuticals groups may be coming to an end / Chemicals and
pharmaceuticals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

EUROPEAN drugs companies, wonder stocks of 1991, had rather more mixed
experiences last year. While some groups - such as Glaxo and SmithKline
Beecham of the UK and Astra of Sweden - enjoyed a successful year, others -
such as Fisons and Wellcome of the UK - had a more turbulent 12 months.
Meanwhile, most European chemicals groups had a difficult time, slipping
down the rankings as the industry suffered from overcapacity and sliding
profits. A few were protected by their speciality chemicals or drugs
operations.
Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group, moved from third to second in the
FT500, as its profits rose 11 per cent to Dollars 2.358bn on turnover up 20
per cent at Dollars 6.76bn. Two years ago it was 10th.
Astra, which competes directly against Glaxo's best-selling drug, the ulcer
treatment Zantac, rose from 37 to 32. Its ulcer medicine and respiratory
drugs helped the Swedish group drive its profits up 36 per cent to Dollars
608m, on turnover up 32 per cent at Dollars 2.2bn.
Other pharmaceuticals groups that did well included Novo Nordisk of Denmark
which moved from 209 to 165; Synthelabo of France which entered the FT500 at
228 thanks to its acquisitions of two laboratories, Delalande and
Delagrange; and Institut Merieux, which moved from 469 to 253, thanks to
strong growth in its vaccine business.
The drugs companies that performed poorly did so thanks to special
circumstances. Fisons, fell from 80 to 215, as its profits fell 17 per cent
from Dollars 380m to Dollars 314m on turnover up 5 per cent at Dollars 2bn.
The company has lost substantial revenues from the withdrawal of two
products in the US because of quality control problems. Efforts to reinstate
one has led to significant costs. A substantial management shakeout has
taken place.
The other company that suffered was Wellcome, although the reason was
nothing to do with the quality of the company. Wellcome Trust, a medical
charity which owned about 74 per cent of Wellcome, decided in March to sell
off a significant part of its stake. However, the company's shares suffered
a long-drawn-out bear raid by institutions which drove the price down from
Pounds 11.26p to under 800p by the time of the issue in July. By the end of
the year, the shares had recovered to well over 950p.
Most chemicals groups suffered from the malaise in European industry caused
by overcapacity and cheap imports from the US which were assisted by the
cheap dollar. Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer,
slipped from 16 to 28. It was also hit by a slowdown in pharmaceuticals
earnings as its best-selling drug, a hypertension treatment called Tenormin,
lost more than half its sales in the US, the world's largest market,
following the expiry of its patents.
Two of the three German giants slipped down the list, Bayer falling from 28
to 34 and BASF from 46 to 56. The third of the trio, Hoechst remained static
at 45. The Germans' ratings were helped by the weakness of the dollar and
strength of the D-Mark. The realisation of the full extent of the slowdown
of the German economy has hit the stocks, as have fears about dividends.
Both Hoechst and BASF cut their pay-outs last year, and all three are
expected to cut further when full-year results are announced in March.
Some chemicals companies outperformed the sector and the market. BOC of the
UK and L'Air Liquide, both industrial gases groups, improved their ratings,
the former from 93 to 80 and the latter from 70 to 52. Industrial gas
companies are strong defensive stocks during recession. Their contracts are
long-term and less vulnerable to the economic swings that hit commodity
chemical products.
Other chemical companies did well because of their pharmaceuticals or
speciality operations. Roche, the Swiss group with strong drugs interests,
had a spectacular year, climbing from 18 to 6 in the FT500, while its
profits soared 113 per cent from Dollars 724m to Dollars 1.54bn on turnover
up 18 per cent at Dollars 8.68bn.
Roche's dramatic rise up the table was partly due to acquisitions - such as
Sara Lee's European over-the-counter business - but was mostly driven by
organic growth of the pharmaceuticals operations. Mr Peter Smith, European
pharmaceuticals analyst at broker James Capel, says Roche has no single
successful product, but enjoys a broad range of medicines that are growing
strongly. The company also benefited from a change in accounting standards
that added to profits.
Sandoz, Roche's competitor and neighbour in Basle, also did well, rising
from 29 to 20 as all of the Swiss pharmaceuticals stocks were re-rated. The
shares have also been driven up in anticipation of the group publishing its
1992 figures according to international accounting standards rather than the
conservative Swiss ones. This could add up to 20 per cent to profits.
The third of the Swiss giants, Ciba-Geigy, had a rather less successful
year, advancing only two positions to 24. The stock suffered from concerns
about the impact of reforms of the EC's common agricultural policy on the
agrochemicals industry in which Ciba-Geigy is the world leader. The dramatic
success of the group's nicotine patch in the US during the first half of the
year was not sustained. And the upturn in the US, which might have helped
its cyclical dyes and polymers businesses, proved slower than expected.
Akzo, the Dutch group, moved from 179 to 124. Although its profits and
turnover were down, the group is partly protected from the slowdown in the
European economies because of its portfolio of speciality businesses. It has
some pharmaceuticals operations and is less exposed to petrochemicals than
its German counterparts, according to Ms Jackie Ashurst, European chemicals
analyst at James Capel.
Chemicals groups that left the UK FT500 included MTM, the speciality
chemicals company, ranked at 290 last year. MTM suffered a catastrophic
collapse in its share price from 189p to under 15p after a profits shortfall
and the subsequent resignation of its founder and chairman.
If the US recovery accelerates and the slowdown on the European continent
looks like it is bottoming out, then the unfashionable chemicals stocks
could come back into fashion. At the same time, the charmed status of
pharmaceuticals groups looks like coming to an end, as investors begin to
switch into cyclical stocks and drugs profits growth slows due to world-wide
efforts by governments to control healthcare spending.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (26): German giant strengthens position - Once
Britain led the world but now mainland companies are dominant. But, the gap
between UK insurers and their continental rivals has not increased in real
terms / Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE mainland European insurance companies continue to dominate an industry
in which Britain historically has been a world leader.
Seven leading general insurance companies are from Germany (Allianz,
Muenchener Ruck), Italy (Generali), Switzerland (Swiss Re and Zurich) and
France (Union des Assurances de Paris and Assurances Generales de France).
Despite a weakening in its share price over the 15 months to September 30,
1992, Allianz, Europe's biggest insurer and now the seventh biggest company
in Europe, dwarfs its competitors.
The German company, which has spent the past two years quietly digesting big
acquisitions in eastern Germany and the US, is still nearly twice as big in
market capitalisation terms as its nearest rival, Generali of Italy, and,
strikingly, nearly 50 per cent bigger than the combined capitalisation of
Britain's five composite insurance companies (Sun Alliance, Commercial
Union, General Accident, Guardian Royal Exchange and Royal Insurance).
UK insurers can at least be relieved, however, that the gap between them and
their rivals on mainland Europe has not increased in real terms, with
currency factors playing a part in the improved ratings of the German
companies. Six of the 17 companies which improved their ratings were German
 -Muenchener Ruck, AMB, Victoria, Wuerttembergische, Volksfuersorge and
Nurnberger.
During the year to September 30, 1992, the mark appreciated by more than 15
per cent against the US dollar, greater than the corresponding increases in
most other European currencies.
Germany's Nurnberger - which entered the rankings for the first time as the
451st biggest company - also strengthened its position with a rights issue.
Other companies moving up the rankings included Aegon, the well-managed and
highly profitable Dutch company which benefited by a 10 per cent rise in its
1991 profits, rising 64 places to 117. Belgium's Royal Belge climbed 44
places to 233rd. Fortis, formed in 1990 by the merger of Amev of the
Netherlands and AG of Belgium, has also risen strongly with its
capitalisation increasing to Dollars 4,206.4m from Dollars 2,942.7m, taking
it from 167 to 104 in the rankings.
Generali (whose capitalisation increased from Dollars 11.87bn to Dollars
13.81bn over the period and rose one place in the rankings to 23rd) also
made rights issues over the period, and also benefited from the fact that
more of its assets are located in Germany and Austria than rival Italian
companies. The original domestic market of the Trieste-based insurer was the
Austro-Hungarian empire.
Irish Life, Ireland's biggest life insurance company, also came into the
rankings for the first time following its privatisation in July 1991.
Britain's Britannic rose by 11 places to 396, after reporting improved
profitability in 1991 (profits up 38 per cent to Dollars 40.8m) with a
performance which reflected the buoyancy - in spite of the recession - of
traditional door-to-door sales of life insurance policies in the UK.
Scandinavia's four largest companies - Skandia and Trygg Hansa SPP Holding
of Sweden and Baltica and Hafnia of Denmark - were the biggest losers. All
the companies suffered from a deterioration in trading conditions across
Scandinavia, but uncertainty stemming from bungled acquisitions and merger
efforts was the most serious factor undermining investor sentiment towards
the sector.
Skandia, the 206th biggest company in Europe by market capitalisation in
1991, was particularly hard hit. Its share price plummeted during the first
half of 1992, after Norway's Uni Storebrand and Denmark's Hafnia borrowed
heavily to fund an ambitious - and ultimately disastrous - takeover plan.
The group's capitalisation sank from SKr14,586m to SKr3,684m. Uni and Hafnia
 -the 498th biggest European company in 1991 - were forced to suspend
payments to creditors in August and by the end of the year the break-up of
both companies appeared to be on the cards.
The capitalisation of Italian, Spanish, French and British companies were
all hit by a downturn in market sentiment, following a series of poor
results in 1991 and falling returns from investments. Two Italian companies
 -Fondiaria and Assitalia (part of the state-owned INA empire) left the
FT500 (Fondiaria ranked 214 in 1992), while RAS - down from 244 to 282 - and
SAI - down from 304 to 417 - also saw their rankings fall.
Alleanza, the life insurer in which Generali has a majority stake, increased
its profits to Dollars 120.3m (Dollars 100,1m), but fell 15 places in the
rankings to 133.
Spain's Mapfre, which entered the FT500 last year, has quickly dropped out
with its share prices dragged down amid a sluggish performance by the
Spanish market as a whole.
France's large state-controlled insurers, which figured in the FT500 for the
first time in 1991, fell back. Investor confidence has been adversely
affected by the prospect of poorer results in 1992 (the figures shown
reflect 1991 performance) as well as the problems of the Paris property
market, in which each of the companies is a significant investor.
Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) fell 17 places to 69, Assurances
Generales de France (AGF) fell 15 places to 110, while Groupe des Assurances
Nationales (GAN) slumped 99 places to 162.
UK composite insurers, which dropped down the table in 1991, registered
further falls in 1992, even though investor confidence in the sector has
recovered in the expectation of better results in 1992.
The combined pre-tax losses in 1991 of the UK's five leading companies - Sun
Alliance, Commercial Union, General Accident, Guardian Royal Exchange and
Royal Insurance - amounted to more than Dollars 2bn.
CU improved its ranking by 10 places (to 115 from 125), but each of the
other companies lost ground, with Royal (down to 303 from 159) worst hit.
Legal &amp; General, a life company which also has greater exposure to non-life
business, also fell (down to 167 from 137).
The UK's biggest listed-life company, Prudential Corporation slipped in the
rankings (down to 51 from 48), in spite of increasing its 1991 profits to
Dollars 441.2m (Dollars 403.2m). Lloyds Abbey Life - the UK's biggest bank
insurance business - saw its capitalisation fall in dollar terms, sinking 24
places as a result to 114th.
Finally, Sun Life, which was taken over by Rockleigh Corporation, the
investment vehicle jointly owned by Liberty Life of South Africa and UAP of
France, lost its London listing and left the FT500.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (27): Takeover creates a powerful new force - As
bad debts continued to affect the industry, management strategies were
largely focused on improving profitability. This has resulted in drastic
cuts in staff numbers / Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST important event in the European banking industry during 1992 was
probably the acquisition of the UK's Midland Bank by HSBC Holdings, the
Hongkong banking group.
The Pounds 3.9bn takeover created a powerful new force in European banking.
In particular, Midland under HSBC's ownership is likely to pose a stiff
competitive threat to the UK's other big banks. The deal also introduced a
high-ranking new member to the FT500, since HSBC has moved its domicile to
London. At a stroke, HSBC has become the second biggest European bank, after
Germany's Deutsche Bank, and the 19th biggest European company.
The remarkably strong performance of HSBC's shares during the year was also
responsible in part for an impressive rise in the stock market index of UK
banks, which performed 20 per cent better than the FT all-share index.
On Europe's three other main stock markets - in France, Germany and
Switzerland - no other banking industry performed as well. German banks
outperformed the Frankfurt market by 10 per cent, but the French banks
underperformed by 2 per cent and the Swiss underperformed by 5 per cent.
UK bank shares, even without HSBC, performed well in the year. The rise was
remarkable because UK banks continued to suffer from record losses on bad
and doubtful loans.
Investors bought their shares in the hope that profit recovery will be
strong, once the UK emerges from recession. Despite the bad debts, UK banks
retained their above-average capital ratios, a key measure of balance sheet
strength.
Nonetheless one big UK bank, Barclays, fell sharply in the FT500 ranking,
from 21st place (and second place among the banks) to 44th (and sixth among
the banks). Barclays' loan losses in 1992 have been significantly worse than
its peers - and its share price has also suffered as a result of persistent
reports that shareholders are unhappy about a board reorganisation.
Having gone into recession before other European countries, analysts expect
the UK to emerge earlier as well. So analysts are forecasting that loans
losses suffered by banks in France, Spain and Germany will rise, as their
economies continue to slow down. Like the UK banks, much of their bad debt
charge is attributable to imprudent commercial property lending.
In one region, Scandinavia, bad debts have come close to wiping out the
local banking industry. There are no Norwegian or Finnish banks in the FT500
 -and only one representative from Denmark, Den Danske Bank, and one from
Sweden, Svenska Handelsbanken.
Sweden's SE Banken and Nordbanken departed from the league table, as did
Unitas Bank and Kansallis Osake Pankki, both from Finland. Norway's big
banks remained under the intensive care of the Norwegian government and were
therefore ineligible for inclusion in the list.
The volatility of currencies within the European exchange rate mechanism
affected most banks. Many of their foreign exchange departments made big
profits from selling the ERM's more vulnerable currencies, such as sterling.
However, French banks' interest rate margins were squeezed in the autumn
when they kept down their loan rates for small businesses and personal
customers, in spite of a rise in money market rates which the French
government had engineered to protect the franc.
The management strategies of most European banks in the year were primarily
focused on improving the profitability of domestic operations. Throughout
Europe, banks attempted to cut staff numbers - with the most dramatic
reductions being made by UK banks.
Preparations for the single European market, which came into effect at the
beginning of 1993, were low key. Cross-border takeover attempts by banks
within the EC were few and far between.
Internationale Nederland Group of the Netherlands tried in the autumn to buy
Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Belgium's second biggest bank. However, in
November ING abandoned its takeover plans, because of disagreement with BBL
on the value of assets held by the Belgian bank.
On the other hand, France's Credit Lyonnais was poised at the end of the
year to acquire control of a majority stake in BfG Bank, Germany's sixth
largest bank.
Another Dutch bank, ABN Amro, expanded its investment banking operations by
purchasing the UK stockbroker, Hoare Govett, from Bank of America of the US
(which had in turn bought Hoare's previous owner, Security Pacific).
Meanwhile, Royal Bank of Scotland experienced difficulty in attempts to sell
its merchant banking subsidiary, Charterhouse. However, at the end of the
year it remained hopeful that a sale would take place in January to a
consortium consisting of Germany's BHF and Credit Commercial de France.
Banks on the whole have abandoned plans to establish pan-European branch
networks and are instead purchasing operations in specific markets which
they feel they understand. Bank encroachment into the sale of life insurance
 -known as Allfinanz or BancAssurance - continued, though there were no big
acquisitions of insurance companies by banks or vice versa.
There was continuing interest among banks about forming transnational
co-operation agreements, sometimes involving the exchange of shares. One of
the most imaginative initiatives in the year was the Royal Bank of
Scotland's establishment of IBOS, an electronic system for linking its
branches with those of Credit Commercial de France, Spain's Banco Santander
and Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal.
Although the EC single market programme has abolished many legal obstacles
to cross-border expansion, a range of cultural, tax and regulatory obstacles
remain. These obstacles on the whole affect retail banking aimed at small
businesses and individuals rather than business between banks themselves or
the provision of services to big companies.
The most graphic example of these obstacles in the year was a French
government prohibition on an attempt by Barclays to introduce a new banking
product to France which was in effect an interest-paying current account.
An assortment of European Community banking directives which came into
effect on January 1 did nothing to remove such barriers to competition. They
relate mainly to the levels of capital which EC banks must have to continue
in business (The Own Funds and Solvency Ratio directives) and the way in
which banks are supervised (the Second Consolidated Supervision Directive
and the Second Banking Directive).
The Second Banking Directive is the most important of the new EC banking
legislation. It creates a 'passport' for EC banks, which allows any bank
authorised to do business in an EC country to set up branches in another EC
country, without the need to get the permission of the supervisor in that
other country.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (21): Travelling hopefully rather than arriving -
There was a brief flurry of enthusiasm when the Conservatives won the
general election, but thereafter corporate Britain found it difficult to
find the path to recovery / United Kingdom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY

<TEXT>
FOR THE top British companies, 1992 will be remembered as the year when
recovery did not arrive. Not only did the domestic economy remain stubbornly
dormant, notwithstanding early sightings of recovery's green shoots, but
there was also a growing realisation within corporate Britain that recovery
when it did come would be slow and undramatic.
After a brief flurry of enthusiasm once the Conservative government had
secured another term in office in April, companies were again travelling
hopefully rather than arriving at the start of the recovery path.
By the time sterling left the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System on 'Black Wednesday' - two weeks before the end of September
cut-off date for the FT 500 table - the FT-SE 100 index had drifted 10 per
cent to a little above 2350, close to an 18-month low. Even with the benefit
of the post-Black Wednesday recovery, September ended with the FT-SE 100
down 2.7 per cent.
Against this gloomy backdrop, it was not surprising that UK-based property
and construction companies, two of the hardest hit sectors in 1991, were
again some of the worst performers within the FT500.
Trafalgar House, the hotels, shipping, construction and engineering group,
had the most dramatic fall, tumbling out of the list from its position in
the top 200, after the company's profits evaporated and the previous year's
profits had to be restated as a loss. The shares regained some of the lost
ground after Hongkong Land made a tender offer in October.
Other companies in the sector fared little better; Hammerson Property,
Taylor Woodrow and George Wimpey, were hit to varying degrees by what is
turning out to be one of the longest recessions in that sector.
All of these companies, committed the sin of cutting their dividend - a sin,
that is, in the eyes of investors even if the surgery was essential for the
patients' health. Similar dividend reductions by Sedgwick, the insurance
broker, Pilkington, the glass makers, and British Petroleum, received
similarly rough treatment by investors and they all lost ground in the table
over the year.
Departing the list following sharp changes in sentiment, were Body Shop, the
cosmetics group, and Albert Fisher, the food retailer, two 1980s companies
which demonstrated that what goes up quickly can fall just as quickly.
Also in the down-but-not-out category was BET, the business services group
that has been a victim of over-zealous expansion in the 1980s. With the
dividend in doubt and the core companies still in some unexciting service
areas, the shares fell in spite of a balance sheet largely refurbished
through a rights issue.
Lonrho, the international trading group headed by Mr Tiny Rowland, was
another to fall from grace, as profits ran out of steam and investors
started to see concentration of power as a liability and not an asset.
While growth remained elusive, stocks with limited recovery potential but
which are considered resilient to recession were again in demand. Glaxo, the
pharmaceutical giant that has in its stable the hugely successful anti-ulcer
drug Zantac, consolidated its 1991 rise by jumping over BT to become the
UK's largest company and the second largest in Europe. Also a beneficiary of
enthusiasm for pharmaceutical stocks was Smithkline Beecham which leapt
ahead of BP, British Gas, Hanson, ICI and BAT Industries.
On the other hand, Fisons, the pharmaceuticals group, slid to number 215
(80), as it ran into registration difficulties in the US - partially
resolved since the year-end. The marked contrast with the fortunes of Glaxo
demonstrate perhaps that in the search for new drugs, there is room only for
the extremely large.
While corporate merger and acquisition activity was limited in 1992, the
year's most successful takeover saw the departure of one of the oldest names
in British banking - Midland. After a battle with rival Lloyds Bank, HSBC
(the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp) swallowed Midland.
Fuelled by the euphoria in the Hong Kong market - at least until Governor
Chris Patten unsettled things by picking a fight with the authorities in
Beijing - HSBC entered the FT500 chart at number 19 and immediately bounded
further ahead to become the FT-SE 100's strongest performer of the year.
Other newcomers to the FT500 made less spectacular entrances. But MFI
Furniture Group, which had laboured for years under a mountain of debt that
financed its management buy-out, made it to the market in the early summer.
Like many of the other post-election flotations, MFI suffered from the
public's lack of interest in the new issues and its shares fell following
flotation before perking up after Black Wednesday.
Bouncing back after losing their way in the late 1980s were two former
forces in high street retailing - Burton Group and Storehouse. The latter
which owns the Mothercare and BHS (formerly British Home Stores) chains, was
another group reversing the move towards creation of conglomerates.
Storehouse began a robust recovery, and announced it was selling its Habitat
stores and Conran's Habitat in the US and the Richards fashion shops in the
UK to focus on its core.
Food retailers, the other great force in the high street and a sector that
has traditionally done well in recession, had a mixed year. J Sainsbury
edged higher in the table, as did Argyll, owner of the Safeway chain, which
began to close the gap between its rating and that of its larger rival.
Tesco, on the other hand, slipped under pressure from Sainsbury which
appeared to be tightening its grip on the number one slot in the sector.
The real winners in the sector were Kwik Save, the budget retailer where a
budget shopping formula struck a chord with consumers; and Iceland Frozen
Foods Holdings which made its debut in the FT500.
Perhaps the most interesting changes in the FT500 this year will be among
the conglomerates, which had mixed fortunes in the year to September. BTR
edged ahead in the table, but has outperformed since the September cut-off
date after a rapid and apparently trouble-free integration of Hawker
Siddeley, the aerospace company. Hanson, on the other hand, slipped and is
now seen to be under some pressure to do a deal.
Tomkins was one of the sector's largest risers. Its purchase of Ranks Hovis
McDougall, the milling and baking company after a head-to-head contest with
Hanson, should continue that momentum.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (22): Shaping up for a split decision / Profile of
Imperial Chemical Industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most exciting events of 1993 is the likely reshaping of Imperial
Chemical Industries, the giant corporation which started life as a defensive
cartel to supply the British Empire.
This month ICI is to decide whether to split the bulk chemicals business
from the bioscience side, which would include the pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals and speciality businesses.
If the split goes ahead, the European chemicals industry would undergo one
of the largest restructurings since the end of the Second World War when the
Allies broke up I G Farben.
The plan was announced in July after Hanson had already sold a 2.8 per cent
stake in ICI and was designed to release hidden value in the two businesses.
Reversing the 1980s trend towards the creation of conglomerates, it would
follow demergers of Vodafone and Chubb Security from Racal, and Courtaulds
Textiles' separation from Courtaulds.
After a split both ICI and its bioscience side would remain quoted
companies. But the bio side, which has been called Zeneca, could go straight
on to the acquisition trail - to gain critical mass in its markets - for
which it is likely to require a rights issue.
As for the bulk chemicals side, ICI will still be operating within a world
recession and a highly cyclical industry.
While the new ICI might have great recovery potential, it could have
diff-iculty generating enough earnings to cover the dividend this year, a
factor that could affect the timing of the demerger.
The market, certainly, has been less than convinced that the ICI alchemy
will make two halves worth more than the whole and the group has slipped
within the FT500.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (20): Household names among the fallen - Tom Burns
discusses the poor showing of a country that has grown faster than the
European Community's average for the better part of a decade / Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH presence in the FT500 gives an adequate representation of the
domestic corporate profile. There are few big Spanish companies and they are
uniformly orientated towards the services sector.
The FT500 includes just 21 companies in 1992, 10 fewer than in the previous
year. It is a poor showing for a society that has one of the larger GDPs in
western Europe as well as one that has grown faster than the European
Community's average for the better part of a decade.
Of the 21 companies present all save three - the state-controlled electrical
utility Endesa, the similarly publicly-owned Banco Exterior and energy group
Compania Espanola de Petroleos, Cepsa, - are lower in the rankings than they
were in the 1991 FT500.
Only six companies appear in the first 100, with the national
telecommunications company Telefonica heading the list and ranked 47, and
eight appear in the second half of the list.
There are 13 departures from the list of which three make a reappearance as
part of a merged group. This is the case of Banco Central and Banco
Hispanoamericano which have come together as the Banco Central
Hispanoamericano, BCH, to form Spain's largest banking institution. It says
a good deal about the size of domestic banks that the BCH should be ranked
92 in the FT500.
The Barcelona-based natural gas distributor Catalana de Gas also drops out
of the list but it reappears as part of Gas Natural.
This company, significantly ranked a lowly 200, is the result of the merger
between the gas divisions of the state-owned energy group Repsol, of Gas
Madrid and of Catalana de Gas.
The only Spanish entrant to the FT500 that can be properly considered a new
one is the retail group Centros Comerciales Pryca which is ranked 191.
Pryca, which has a market capitalisation of Dollars 2.3bn, is, however,
Spanish only up to a somewhat marginal point. More than 70 per cent of its
stock is controlled by the French hypermarket giant Carrefour.
Departures from the list include a string of companies that are household
names in Spain. This is the case with the largest national insurance group
Mapfre and with the twin giants of the domestic real estate market,
Vallehermoso, which is controlled by BCH, and of Metrovacesa which is a
subsidiary of the rival big bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV.
Also out of the 1992 FT500 was Corporacin Financiera Alba, Spain's biggest
private holding company which is owned by the March family. One of Alba's
main income earners is the 10 per cent stake it holds in the Pryca
hypermarket venture. Likewise squeezed out was Ebro Agricolas, the sugar and
rice producer that has been one of the few profitable investments undertaken
by the Kuwait Investment Office, KIO, in Spain and which is the largest
domestic agri-business company.
Aside from their comparatively small size and their lowered weighting, the
main distinctive feature of the Spanish companies in the FT500 is that with
the exception of the state-owned tobacco producer Tabacalera not one of them
is involved in a non-energy manufacturing process. The business of the big
Spanish corporations has to do with finance, with utilities and with
services in general.
Seven of the Spanish companies that appear on the list, a full third of the
total domestic contingent, are in fact banks. A further five are electrical
utilities and three are energy-based corporations. The others are
Telefonica, Tabacalera, Pryca, the construction company Fomento de
Construcciones, the Barcelona-based water utility holding Aguas de Barcelona
and the highway toll-concession holder Autopistas, Acesa.
An additional feature is that seven of the 21 companies on the list are
state-controlled and a trio of publicly-owned companies, Telefonica, the
electrical utility Endesa and the Repsol energy corporation are the highest
ranked Spain representatives on the FT500.
The poor Spanish showing is a reflection of the huge foreign penetration of
domestic business. Non-Spanish companies, for example, control all the
domestic car sector and some 75 per cent of the large components and
accessories business that has grown up around it, eight of the top 10
domestic chemical companies and some 60 per cent of the domestic cement
sector.
Some of those Spanish companies that appear in the FT500 are likely in the
future to see their weighting reduced. This could be the case with
Telefonica for in 1991 just 1 per cent of its revenues came from business
that was open to competition while by 1994 this proportion will have risen
to 34 per cent due to deregulation. It could also be the case for the
electrical utilities, likewise blue-chip Spanish companies, which have in
the past weeks been nursing the impact of the peseta's devaluation on their
borrowings.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (19): On the trail of new potential markets / A
look east and discovers that American companies were the biggest investors
last year in the 28 countries which have emerged from the wreckage of the
former Soviet bloc - Eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
FAITH and endurance have been the main requirements for companies doing
business with eastern Europe and beyond during the first three years of the
post-communist age. The macro-economic picture still looks dire for much of
Russia and the former Soviet Union. But for central Europe the awaited
turnaround from steep economic decline to the beginning of steady economic
growth looks attainable in 1993.
Much depends on the depth of the German recession and its knock-on effects
throughout the rest of the European Community to which more than 50 per cent
of central Europe's rising exports are now directed. But some economists
believe that the combination of an over-valued mark and over-paid workers,
especially in former east Germany, means that central European companies
offering cheap labour, and the ability to produce low-cost components,
construction materials, foodstuffs and other goods, will be increasingly
attractive to recession-hit western companies desperately seeking to reduce
their cost base.
The lure of new potential markets and low-cost production sites has begun to
exert an increasingly powerful attraction for western companies, including
the US companies and corporations which were also quicker than many European
companies to spot the potential of the Common Market 30 years ago. According
to data compiled by the East European Investment Magazine, US corporations
were the biggest investors last year in the 28 countries which have emerged
from the wreckage of the former Soviet bloc.
In the 12 months to the end of September 1992, US companies made 219
acquisitions, joint ventures and greenfield investments worth Dollars 8bn,
around 30 per cent of the total Dollars 28bn invested in the area over this
period. The US share was equivalent to the entire private investment in the
region in 1991, reflecting the fact that, in spite of the manifold
difficulties of doing business in the region, overall investment tripled in
1992.
The attraction is mutual. Governments in Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic in particular welcome US investment for politico-strategic as much
as economic and financial reasons. President Lech Walesa of Poland, for
example, made clear that having General Motors invest in Poland was
equivalent to having a US division on Polish soil.
US food and consumer goods companies have been quick to capitalise on the
attraction of famous brands, from Big Macs, to Levi-Strauss jeans and
Coca-Cola, and to see the advantage of selling to west European markets from
low cost bases in the east. General Electric was one of the first to take
the plunge with its acquisition of Tungsram in Hungary. To its chagrin
profitability has been hit by the failure of the Hungarian forint to
depreciate as expected. But the realisation that Hungary is a cheap place to
do research and development work has partially compensated.
The lengthening list of US consumer companies, including Procter and Gamble
and Sara Lee, is accompanied by US telecommunications, chemical and energy
companies. The latter are increasingly interested in oil and gas exploration
and development in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, rather than Russia, where
delays in formulating appropriate legislation continue to raise frustration
levels.
Despite the mounting US interest, however, European companies remain the
most committed to investment and expansion in the post-communist countries
of Europe and Eurasia while Japanese companies, with rare exceptions, remain
on the sidelines.
Volkswagen's commitment to invest a scaled down DM7bn on modernising and
expanding output at Skoda Automobilova in the Czech republic, where it is
building up to a 70 per cent stake, remains the biggest single investment
project in the region. Fiat, battling to keep up in the FT500, has committed
Dollars 2bn to Poland, in spite of a damaging strike at its new Cinquecento
plant in southern Poland.
Companies in France, Italy, Benelux, and to a much lesser extent in Britain,
realise that unless they move to establish strategic positions in the former
communist states while they are still relatively cheap and available, the
region will become increasingly dominated by German companies moving back
into what is a traditional sphere of trade and influence.
German investment at present is concentrated in former east Germany, but the
big German companies and banks, as well as thousands of small and
medium-sized companies from Germany and Austria, have used the advantage of
proximity and their tradition of long-term thinking to establish or
re-establish themselves.
With global profits under pressure and the German domestic market in
recession, however, it is proving increasingly difficult for some German
companies to justify their faith in the long-term prospects for growth,
especially in many parts of the former Soviet Union. BASF, the
Ludwigshafen-based chemical company, for example, has subsidiaries in
central Europe and expensive representative offices in many parts of the
former Soviet Union, including five in Russia from which it imports gas,
naphtha and basic chemicals. But the costs of doing business in the less
centralised new environment are rising sharply while demand for chemicals is
only 55 per cent of 1989 levels.
Some industries are clearly longer term than others. But some strategic
investors have already shown impressive results from quite modest initial
investments in the region and are well placed to gain from the long-awaited
upturn expected in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary this year.
ABB Asea Brown Boveri, which announced the first big investment deal of 1993
by taking a 67 per cent stake in the Czech republic's biggest boiler,
turbine and power plant company, Prvni Brnenska Strjirna (PBS), is a classic
strategic investor. Over the past three years it has taken a controlling
stake in 26 east and central European power and engineering companies. The
Swiss-Swedish company is convinced that modernising the energy sector to
raise generating efficiency and reduce pollution will be a top priority
throughout the region.
Its main Polish company, ABB Zamech, has achieved rapid productivity
increases and won export orders worth Dollars 150m, and the injection of new
management skills and technology has helped weld a powerful new industrial
force in central Europe which should generate 4 to 5 per cent of ABB's
global revenues in three years' time.

FT  10 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Charter deal welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A POOR session in the market, the spotlight fell on the day's biggest
deal, in which industrial group Charter Consolidated finally offloaded its
38.3 per cent holding in metals refiner Johnson Matthey.
The deal was executed in two parts. A 20 per cent stake was sold to a
company jointly owned by Johannesburg Consolidated Investment and Minorco.
In an unexpected move, the remaining 18.3 per cent was quickly placed in the
market with institutions by BZW and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The two securities
houses were reported to have paid 455p a share and passed the stake on at
456p.
Turnover in Johnson Matthey jumped to 66m as the stock dropped 19 to 473p,
while Charter followed the market lower and closed 28 down at 656p.
Mr Rob Davies at Lehman Brothers said: 'This is a good deal for Charter. In
addition, it not only removes the uncertainty over Johnson Matthey but also
increases the liquidity in the stock.'
Following the sale, speculation about how Charter was to use the proceeds of
the deal did the rounds. One view was that it may buy out the 35.8 per cent
stake in Charter held by Minorco. Another view was that it may bid for
engineering group Vickers, 2 firmer at 124p.
Storehouse falls
Hints that the chief executive of Storehouse might be about to leave the
group sent the shares into swift retreat amid unusually heavy turnover of
8.9m.
The rumours in the UK market appeared to centre on an article in a US trade
magazine which suggested that Mr David Dworkin had been approached by Carter
Hawley Hale, the Los Angeles-based store chain. Storehouse refused to
comment although a statement is expected today.
The shares fell heavily, slipping 17 before recovering to close 11 off at
194p. Stores specialists said that, if true, the news would spell an
uncertain time for the shares, which have staged a dramatic recovery,
climbing from 85p in January last year.
Mr Dworkin is credited with having turned Storehouse around and analysts
said finding a comparable executive replacement would be difficult.
Wellcome firm
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was one of the rare bright spots in a
depressed FT-SE 100 Index as two securities houses recommended the stock.
The shares held firm all day and closed 10 higher at 895p.
Mr Robin Gilbert of broking house Panmure Gordon issued a 16-page analysis
highlighting Wellcome as the key buy in the sector.
He said Zovirax, the group's anti-herpes drug, and Retrovir, its anti-Aids
treatment, were the only two headline drugs in the sector which were cheaper
in the US than in Europe. Consequently, they were less likely to come under
pressure from the Clinton administration, which has promised to attack the
whole area of drug pricing.
Also, US house Lehman Brothers was advising its clients to switch out of
SmithKline Beecham, arguing that Wellcome was cheaper in price/earnings
terms. SmithKline 'A' fell 15 1/2 to 448 1/2 p and the Units 15 to 389p.
Waters wanted
The water sector moved sharply higher just before the close after
suggestions that Ofwat, the water industry watchdog, is about to tell the
water companies that increased efficiency in their core businesses could be
passed on to shareholders via dividend payments. But, utilities specialists
pointed out, inefficient companies would have their dividend payouts
restricted.
Talk that letters confirming Ofwat's efficiency/dividend strategy will be
received by the water companies today saw the sector substantially
outperform the wider market.
Welsh Water was seen as a prime beneficiary of the move and raced up 11 to
552p, closely followed by Wessex Water, which settled 7 better at 597p;
Wessex nil-paid closed 6 firmer at 113p. Other good performances in the
sector came from Southern, 5 ahead at 492p, and Northumbrian, 4 harder at
566p.
US sells Reuters
US analysts took a harder view on the full-year figures from Reuters
Holdings than their UK colleagues and early firmness in the stock was
undermined when Wall Street opened. Reuters profit of Pounds 382.2m was so
close to UK analysts' forecasts that the share price gave virtually no
response.
The chief executive's statement, traditionally cautious, was relatively
upbeat and the market liked the near 25 per cent rise in the dividend. Early
indications suggested forecasts for this year would rise to between Pounds
430m and Pounds 440m. The shares were marginally higher at one stage but US
analysts had been expecting more from the results and US selling took the
London price to a close of 15 off at 1382p.
The financial areas of the market remained among the market's favourities to
provide the next heavy rights issue. Lloyds Bank assumed the role of the
bank most likely to ask shareholders for cash and dipped 17 to 517p.
Sun Alliance's Pounds 155m convertible bond issue lifted lingering fears of
a rights issue but did not prevent the shares declining 9 to 333p.
Commercial Union remained the sector favourite to launch a fund-raising
attempt and the shares lost 22 more to 598p. Specialists said the 11 1/2 per
cent and 8 3/4 per cent yields on CU's two tranches of preference stock
issued last year were looking demanding and could be replaced with equity
capital.
The prospect of a broad agreement on output cuts at this weekend's Opec
meeting prompted another strong performance from an oil sector boosted by a
further slide in sterling.
British Gas receded 6 1/2 to 283 1/2 p, unsettled by the Ofgas annual
report, and profits downgrades instigated by Hoare Govett, the company's
broker. Hoare cut its 1992 net income estimate to Pounds 865m and its 1993
figure to Pounds 980m, in spite of emphasising its positive stance on the
stock.
Aran Energy was the market's second most heavily traded stock with more than
14m shares changing hands. Smith New Court was responsible for most of the
buying after publishing a strong buy recommendation. Aran closed 2 1/2 up at
23 1/2 p.
Tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries led the downward trend as SG
Warburg Securities nudged back its stance on the shares. The stock hit 967p
before rallying to close 18 off at 976p.
Further speculation over the terms and conditions of the Kingfisher bid for
Darty, the French electrical retailer, left the market none the wiser.
Yesterday's focus was again on the level of the rights issue that will be
required to finance any offer, with a variety of rumours circulating. The
strongest suggested an announcement was imminent over a one-for-12 call at
480p. All combined to weaken the shares, which had performed well in recent
sessions as fears of a Pounds 1bn issue were scaled down. The shares closed
5 adrift at 526p.
Another bid target, Clifford Foods, added 2 at 515p, while one of its
rumoured predators, Unigate, put on 4 at 331p. A line of 5m shares in Albert
Fisher was said to have unsettled the stock, off 6 at 66p.
Hunting jumped 13 to 233p after the company announced the sale of its
protective coatings subsidiary to Williams Holdings. Mr Clive
Forrestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said the deal would enhance profits
at Hunting substantially over the next two years. Williams closed 2 lighter
at 342p. British Steel remained active and turnover rose to 9.4m as the
shares lost 2 to 75p.

FT  10 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cash call fears return to haunt
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONDON stock market badly unsettled by weakness in sterling and a host of
corporate deals suffered a further setback in late trading yesterday on
renewed fears that a large rights issue was about to hit the trading desks.
Several of Britain's biggest companies, all due to report profits shortly,
were named as possible raisers of equity in the Pounds 1bn-plus range.
Confidence in prospects for a further cut in UK base rates at Budget time
were challenged by the continued weakness in sterling. Fears that the
pound's fall implies renewed inflationary pressure were fuelled by the
announcement yesterday that UK producer input prices had jumped by 1.5 per
cent in the month to January, significantly more than predicted in the
market.
A firm opening in equities was reversed when two UK investment houses began
to sell the FT-SE March futures contract heavily. At worst the stock market
showed a loss of 47 points on the Footsie scale.
The Dow Average fell 13 Dow points in UK hours and any benefits for UK
equities from a very modest rally in sterling were blotted out by the rights
issue rumours.
The FT-SE 100 Index closed 38.7 points down at 2,831.3 with selling pressure
increasing at the end of the day. The FT-SE Mid 250 lost 31.6 to 3,019.8.
Seaq volume increased smartly to 694.9m shares from the 545.7m of the
previous session, when retail business remained brisk at a worth of Pounds
1.03bn. Non-Footsie business made up 61 per cent of Seaq trading yesterday.
Fund managers' caution on rights issue fears was heightened by the prospect
of trading statements from virtually all the big Footsie names over the next
few weeks. Yesterday brought further calls on institutional cash holdings in
the shape of a placing of Johnson Matthey shares following sale of part of
the stake held by Charter Consolidated, and a Pounds 155m Euro convertible
issue from Sun Alliance; European institutions faced a French franc
convertible from Axa, the insurance group.
Taking in rights issues already announced, some Pounds 1.2bn has now been
taken out of the equity market since Christmas, and managers fear that
impending rights issues alone could mean a drain of Pounds 5bn to Pounds
6bn.
Only the oils and the water stocks stood out against the general rout in
share prices. Oil shares benefited from hopes that the Opec countries will
agree on production cuts, while water stocks responded to hints of
favourable regulatory developments.
But across the rest of the market, there were few safe havens from the
profit-takers. Property, building construction and stores shares, all
boosted recently on interest rate hopes, turned down smartly.
The banking sector, which opens its reporting season this week, shied away
from rights issue worries. Food retailers suffered yet further selling on
taxation concern and brewery stocks ran into sellers.
The outlook for this morning's opening appeared unfavourable, with the only
comfort coming from the stock index futures market, where the March contract
on the Footsie bounced in late trading. Much will depend on whether the
stock market is spared a rights issue announcement in the first half of the
trading session.

FT  10 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Weak foreign bourses
undermine equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
LOSSES ON overseas equity markets, weaker domestic bond prices and continued
consolidation of recent gains left US stocks lower across the board
yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 22.96 at 3,414.58.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 declined 2.52 to 445.33, the
American SE composite receded 2.16 to 415.00 and the Nasdaq composite
retreated 6.23 to 692.21. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 240m
shares.
Picking up where they left off late on Monday, US investors began selling
stocks yesterday. News of weakness in foreign markets, including Tokyo,
Frankfurt and, especially, London, set the tone for a downbeat opening.
Lower US Treasury prices - a nervous reaction ahead of the week's big
auctions of government securities - and some profit-taking in the wake of
last week's record-setting gains only exacerbated the downward trend.
Among individual stocks, the last batch of fourth-quarter earnings reports
trickled in. Whirlpool moved ahead Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 51 5/8 in busy
trading after the company unveiled final quarter 1992 net income of Dollars
62m, up from Dollars 40m a year ago, in spite of a pre-tax restructuring
charge of Dollars 18m. Whirlpool also announced that its financial unit
would be withdrawing from its aerospace and most of its commercial financing
activities.
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber slipped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 70 3/8 after news of
a small improvement to Dollars 102.8m in fourth-quarter income, before
extraordinary items. After accounting for the early retirement of debt,
however, Goodyear's net income dropped from Dollars 105m seen a year ago to
Dollars 87.5m - in line with market expectations.
Sears Roebuck firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 49 1/2 in solid two-way trade
after the retailing group reported a net loss of Dollars 1.8bn in the fourth
quarter in the wake of a number of significant special items. If the impact
of those items was ignored, Sears' income from continuing operations rose
from Dollars 433.6m posted a year ago to Dollars 504.2m.
News Corporation advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 39 7/8 on news that the
multinational media and entertainment group's operating income for the
second fiscal quarter had risen from the 67 cents a share recorded a year
earlier to 91 cents a share.
IBM bucked the trend, rising Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 53 3/8 in volume of
3.6m shares. Other big computer stocks were also firmer. Canada
TORONTO moved higher in heavy trading as a surge in gold stocks helped to
extend the market's February rally.
The TSE 300 index ended 19.3 ahead at 3,414.1 and rises outnumbered declines
by 337 to 303 after volume of 53m shares valued at CDollars 479m.
Eight of the 14 stock groups gained ground, led by the golds sector, up 3.7
per cent. The spot price for gold in New York rose 40 cents to USDollars
328.45 an ounce, but the day's excitement among precious metals came from a
surge in platinum, USDollars 5.50 stronger at USDollars 366 an ounce.
American Barrick rose CDollars 1 3/8 to CDollars 40 7/8 to lead the gold
group. On Monday the company declared a two-for-one stock split and lifted
its dividend by about 23 per cent.

FT  10 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japanese exporters sold
after rise in yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP rise in the yen against the dollar prompted selling in
export-related issues and share prices lost ground as cautious investors
refrained from activity, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average shed 259.46 to 17,022.27, having opened at the day's high
of 17,261.56. The index recorded the day's low of 16,976.72 on investment
trust and arbitrage selling in the afternoon before recovering to the 17,000
level on buying by corporate investors at the end of the session.
Volume declined to 190m shares from 203m. Losers led gainers by 769 to 183,
with 165 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost
13.49 to 1,296.10 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.92 to
1,046.93.
Equities initially met selling from investment trusts and arbitrageurs,
before the yen jumped against the dollar on reports that Mr Fred Bergsten,
director of the Institute for International Economics, of the US, had said
at a seminar in Kyoto that the desirable range for the yen was Y100 to Y110
against the dollar. Reports that European Community leaders were calling for
a reduction in Japan's trade surplus also accelerated buying of the yen.
The currency rose to an intraday high of Y121.95 against the dollar, before
closing at Y122.35. The dollar fell below the Y122 level for the first time
since October 28 last year.
Isuzu Motors, the day's most active issue, slipped Y7 to Y374 on
profit-taking by dealers, while shares bought on the 'restructuring theme'
also declined as investors took profits: Oki Electric receded Y15 to Y395
and Nissan Chemical retreated Y5 to Y750.
High-technology exporters lost ground on earnings worries due to the higher
yen. Fujitsu weakened Y12 to Y547, NEC Y15 to Y637 and Hitachi Y14 to Y707.
Uni-Charm, leading diaper maker, appreciated Y20 to Y1,780 on hopes of a 40
per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the current year to March.
Dainippon Screen, a precision machinery maker, posted its third consecutive
advance, rising Y13 to Y653. Individual investors sought the issue on hopes
of strong sales for its semiconductor manufacturing equipment and liquid
crystal displays.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 164.97 to 18,496.56 in volume of 59.5m
shares.
Roundup
TRADING was quiet throughout much of the region, although Sydney provided a
bright spot.
AUSTRALIA moved sharply higher after Prime Minister Paul Keating announced
plans to cut company tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent; subsequent
profit-taking pared the gains.
The All Ordinaries index, which rose 50 points to a six-month intraday high
of 1,609 on the government's statement, ended 24.5 up at 1,583.9 in heavy
turnover of ADollars 486.6m.
The other highlight of trade was an ADollars 1.20 rise by News Corporation
at ADollars 29.90 after touching a record ADollars 31.18 on announcing
interim net profits up 27.5 per cent.
HONG KONG saw some early excitement which took the Hang Seng index more than
20 points higher on reports, subsequently denied, that China and Britain
would resume talks on the colony's future next month.
Later trading lacked impetus and the index eased back to end just 2.87 ahead
at 5,789.52 in thin volume of HKDollars 1.57bn.
SINGAPORE was modestly firmer after a quiet day as investors awaited details
of the government's proposed goods and services tax, announced after the
market closed.
The Straits Times Industrial index gained 8.79 at 1,624.52 as late bargain
hunting reversed early losses.
KUALA LUMPUR edged lower on profit-taking after the recent surge. The
composite index lost 1.63 to 639.97.
A two-day meeting of Malaysia's hereditary rulers, beginning today, over
constitutional amendments to remove their legal immunity also made investors
cautious.
Technology Resources rose 30 cents to MDollars 2.09 in turnover of 35.4m
shares after news that it will distribute shares in its Malaysian Helicopter
unit free to shareholders.
BOMBAY climbed again on speculative pre-budget buying, the BSE index
finishing 59.53 stronger at 2,771.68.

FT  10 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Stockholm takes comfort from
Ericsson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staf
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERICSSON gained 9.4 per cent yesterday after releasing 1992 results which
exceeded most analysts' forecasts, writes Our Markets Staff.
STOCKHOLM took new life after the Ericsson results, lifting the B shares by
SKr18 to SKr209 and the Affarsvarlden General index by 4.2 to 948.9.
Turnover was SKr1bn after SKr1.2bn on Monday, with Ericsson accounting for
some SKr341m.
Profit-taking affected some other issues after recent gains: Volvo B lost
SKr1 to SKr385 and Skanska B fell SKr3 at SKr88. Electrolux B improved SKr6
to SKr224.
OSLO rose 3.1 per cent to its highest close of the year as investors were
encouraged by lower interest rates . The all-share index rose 12.23 to
401.86 in turnover of NKr456.8m.
Hafslund, which reported good 1992 earnings on Monday, advanced NKr6.50 in
the B shares to NKr151.00.
COPENHAGEN extended its slide, depressed by high interest rates, the KFX
index losing another 1.36 to 82.10. Den Danske Bank fell DKr6.27 to DKr285
after solid gains in recent weeks and Sophus Berendsen was DKr13 lower at
DKr416, affected by the fall in sterling. HELSINKI closed higher on a fall
in domestic interest rates, the Hex index rising 11.8 to 911.0.
FRANKFURT eased, but chemicals improved as the DAX index closed 5.58 lower
at 1,641.58 in turnover down from DM6.4bn to DM5.8bn.
BASF, the neglected stock among the big three over the past year or two, led
the sector yesterday with a rise of DM2.40 to DM227, Bayer adding DM1.10 to
DM275.60 and Hoechst a modest 30 pfg to DM264.30.
Hoare Govett said this week that BASF had 'considerable potential' for a
positive dividend surprise, and cyclical recovery prospects but that
Hoechst, even with its large US operations, was overvalued after a long run
of relative strength on the dollar.
Meanwhile, AMB defied the ebb in financials with a rise of DM15 to DM885
taking its gain to DM100 this month. Mr Bob Yates at Fox Pitt said that
speculation about AMB's ownership structure, 29 per cent with AGF of France
('in the driving seat') and 20 per cent with Fondiaria in Italy, ignored the
perils of being in a German minority.
PARIS weakened further with Eurotunnel, down FFr1.15 to FFr37.70 on
profit-taking, continuing to be the most active stock. The CAC-40 index
finished down 10.68 at 1,894.05 in turnover of FFr2.8bn.
Havas rose FFr9.50 to FFr439.00 with two large blocks totalling 250,000
shares going through the market: there was speculation that Lyonnaise-Dumez,
down FFr4.90 at FFr425.20, might have been selling part of its stake.
Chargeurs improved FFr7 to FFr1,369 on news that it might increase its stake
in BSkyB, the UK satellite operator, and Bouygues shed FFr6 to FFr634 on
taking a 26 per cent shareholding in a South African building group.
Axa, which fell sharply after it announced a FFr3.6bn convertible bond issue
after the Monday's close, lost FFr28 to FFr1,114, while Total slipped
FFr3.70 to FFr235.60 on 1992 figures which were generally in line with
expectations.
ZURICH consolidated after last week's gains and the SMI index eased 1.5 to
2,135.7.
Nestle bearers were unchanged at SFr1,085 as it announced the sale of parts
of its Perrier mineral water operations to SAI, French parent company of the
Castel group.
MILAN marked time after its recent strong run as trading fell off ahead of
the close of the monthly trading account next Monday. The Comit index fell
9.44 to 499.68. Fiat set the tone, fixing L163 lower at L4,686 and falling
to L4,615 after hours.
Banco di Roma, L44 higher on Monday, rose another L39 to fix at L2,049
before trading up to L2,060 amid renewed speculation about the bank's
privatisation.
AMSTERDAM saw currency sensitive stocks fall back as the CBS General index
closed down 0.1 at 97.9. Elsevier and Unilever were affected by weaker
sterling, declining byFl 2.10 and Fl 1.20 respectively to Fl 126.00 and Fl
195.40.
Akzo and DSM reversed the trend with gains of Fl 1.20 and Fl 1.50
respectively to Fl 144.20 and Fl 74.90.
MADRID dropped on gloomy economic news and futures-related selling. The
general index lost 4.14 to 235.03, reflecting profit-taking after last
week's gains, and higher unemployment and lower economic growth.
ATHENS put on another 6 per cent with the banking sector leading the way,
mainly on strong domestic buying. The index rose 48.44 to 882.07 in turnover
estimated at some Dr5-6bn, up from Monday's Dr3bn and well ahead of the
average daily figure of Dr1bn.
TEL AVIV closed sharply lower in active trading in reaction to comments by
the Bank of Israel governor, Mr Jacob Frenkel, warning that the market was a
'bubble'. The blue chip index fell 4.8, or 2.2 per cent to 213.37, its first
loss after seven consecutive gains.

FT  10 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Seoul awaits new stimuli after late
rally in 1992 - The recent recovery in South Korea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent cut in South Korea's official interest rates is expected to have
mixed effects on the Seoul equity market this year.
Most analysts believe that the cut will lay the foundation for a recovery in
the second half of the year as economic conditions improve, although it will
not match the gains which the market has achieved in the past six months.
The immediate result has been profit-taking, and a fall in the Korea
composite index from a January 9 high of 709.77 to yesterday's 675.33. The
market had already anticipated the interest rate cut,
rising by 55 per cent from last year's low.
The rise in share prices also reflected investor confidence in the country's
political stability following the mid-December election of Mr Kim Young-sam
of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party as the country's next president.
Expectations that the economy will rebound this year after a dismal 1992 was
another reason for the advance.
There are predictions that the market will reach the 800-point level later
this year after a sluggish first half. 'The recent downturn in share prices
is natural given the highly speculative nature of the Seoul market,' says Mr
Andrew Holland, research director for Barclays de Zoete Wedd in South Korea,
but falling interest rates are expected to encourage the placing of more
funds in the liquidity-driven equity market, as bonds become less lucrative.
More foreign money is also expected to flow into the Seoul bourse if the
government keeps its promise of increasing the foreign investor ceiling from
the current 10 per cent to 15 or 20 per cent later this year. The foreign
shareholding limit has been filled for about 10 per cent of the 691
companies listed on the exchange.
Foreigners made a net investment of Dollars 2.07bn in the market in 1992,
the first year the bourse was open to direct investment from abroad. Foreign
investment could double this year due to the expanded foreign shareholding
quota; in January, at Dollars 476m, it reached its highest ever monthly
total.
The relaxation on foreign investment controls should coincide with an
improvement in earnings, as lower interest rates reduce the financial costs
of Korea's overleveraged companies. The Ministry of Finance estimates that
falling interest rates will reduce total corporate financial expenses by
Won3,000bn (Dollars 3.7bn); analysts predict that earnings will increase by
10 to 20 per cent.
The interest rate cut is considered a preliminary step to several
stimulative measures the new government will take this year to boost
economic growth. Officials hope to achieve GNP growth of 6 per cent in 1993,
against an estimated 4.5 per cent last year, the worst economic performance
since the 1980 recession.
Several large infrastructure projects could boost the share price of
construction stocks, while lower interest rates may benefit financial
shares.
Investor interest in small and medium-sized companies is expected to
recover: the state plans to provide more credit to these concerns to prevent
a further wave of the bankruptcies which reached a near-record level last
year.
Bank shares may also be bolstered as the government unveils proposals in
mid-year about a restructuring of the financial industry, which could
include plans for bank mergers.
Analysts warn, however, that the bourse is likely to peak at around 800, as
institutional investors sell a large overhang of securities which they
acquired in 1990 when the market was last at that level.
An administrative guideline introduced last August - requiring institutional
investors to buy more stock than they sell - has so far prevented them from
disposing of their share surplus. But this market-boosting measure is
unlikely to be extended by the government past May or June.
An expected increase in share offerings to take advantage of an expiring
corporate tax deduction could also soak up liquidity and depress prices.
Another possible adverse factor is interest rate deregulation. Most lending
and deposit rates are scheduled to be freed this year, which is expected to
drive up interest rates in the short term. Although industry generally
considers interest rate reform essential to its future prosperity, the
immediate effect may be to curb the market's climb.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Few hopes for repo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENTIMENT IN both the French and German money markets remained dull
yesterday as dealers assumed that another cut in German interest rates might
still be some way off, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank announced that tomorrow's weekly intervention in the German
money markets will be by means of variable rate repos for 14 and 28 days.
But call money yesterday hovered around the level of 8.60 per cent,
suggesting that few dealers expected the lowest accepted bid for funds to
fall below the current level of 8.57 per cent.
'There may be a few points off the repo rate,' said one London based dealer,
'but I would be very surprised if it were much more than that.'
Last Thursday, the Bundesbank's announcement that it would be holding a
press conference after its fortnightly council meeting brought out the rate
cut bulls, forcing three-month D-Marks below 8 per cent and the March
Euromark contract as high as 92.30.
But yesterday, both instruments were back to where they were before the rate
cut announcement. Three-month money closed at 8.32 per cent and the March
contract finished at 92.02, suggesting that three-month money next month
will be at 7.98 per cent. A dealer suggested that this was proving to be a
stable level for the contract.
Sentiment in the French market remained dull. One-month French francs crept
up to 11.75 per cent on the bid side in the early morning, and stayed there
for the rest of the day. Three-month rates were also at that level for most
of the day.
The March French franc contract continued to be sold heavily, dropping 34
basis points before recovering to a close of 88.87.
Three-month sterling cash firmed to 6 3/16 per cent from 6 1/8 per cent as
the pound slipped on the foreign exchanges.
The March sterling contract fell 7 basis points to a low for the day of
94.10 before ending back at 94.17. At this level, it assumes that
three-month money at UK Budget time will be at 5.83 per cent.
Conditions in the discount market were a great deal easier after a sticky
day on Tuesday. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.1bn at
the start of the day, which was completely removed. The overnight rate was
seen as low as 2 per cent at around 10am.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: The yen returns to the stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese yen enjoyed a remarkable rally against both the D-Mark and the
dollar yesterday after months of almost dormant trading, writes James Blitz.
The cause of the rally was growing speculation that G7 policy-makers might
call for a stronger yen to try and reduce Japan's huge trade surplus
vis-a-vis the US.
Two specific incidents triggered the flight into the Japanese currency. The
first was a Japanese newspaper report, which could not be substantiated,
suggesting that the European parliament had expressed concern that the yen
was undervalued against the dollar.
Reports that Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, would have a
weekend meeting with Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, also
raised speculation that the Clinton administration would like to see a
stronger yen.
The currency finished at Y73.42 against the D-Mark after a previous close of
Y74.91. Against the dollar, it ended at Y121.35, up from a previous Y124.0;
and later in New York closed at Y121.17.
In Europe, sterling continued to dominate events, falling to an historic low
against the Exchange Rate Index and testing the all-time low against the
D-Mark of DM2.3470.
For the second day running, the UK currency was the victim of a heavy
sell-off in the morning, only part of which was retraced in the afternoon.
At about 7.45am in London yesterday, the pound was trading at about
DM2.3775. Over the following two hours its exchange rate against the D-Mark
suffered a sharp fall, bottoming out at DM2.3480 at around 9.30am.
The currency recovered around a pfennig over the next hour, but was again
hit by the release of the January input prices data. This showed that the
cost of raw materials purchased by manufacturers rose by a seasonally
adjusted 1.5 per cent between December and January.
Sterling closed in London at DM2.3625, down 2 pfennigs on the day and 3.25
pfennigs on the week so far. In trading yesterday, the pound hit its lowest
level against the dollar this year, Dollars 1.4150, before finishing at
Dollars 1.4305, off nearly a cent on the day. In New York it ended trading
also at Dollars 1.4305.
Some said the pound's loss of value was exaggerated by the thinness of the
market, although there were signs of heavy selling by institutions from the
US and Middle East. Few dealers could make a firm bet on how the currency
would move in the next few days.
Sterling's fall was partly triggered by a perception that German rates were
unlikely to come down by much at today's weekly Bundesbank intervention.
'We can expect a lowest accepted repo of 8.50 per cent at the very best,'
said one dealer, recalling that last week's rate was 8.57 per cent.
The duller sentiment was felt by the French franc, which closed at FFr3.3850
per D-Mark, down from FFr3.3810.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minority group may block banana
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission was bracing itself for a potentially embarrassing
upset last night, as signs emerged that a minority of European Community
member states led by Germany might block the controversial agreement reached
last December setting quotas and tariffs on banana imports from Latin
America.
Germany and Denmark held out against the agreement in December, when it was
passed by qualified majority vote. Since then, however, new objections have
been raised by the Benelux countries. If all five countries combined, they
would have enough strength under the EC's weighted voting system to block
the measure.
The new regime, which is scheduled to be agreed by the end of this month and
to start operating on July 1, fixes a 2m tonnes quota for Latin American
so-called 'dollar bananas', at a reduced duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 82) a tonne,
and imposes an Ecu850 tariff - about 170 per cent  - on imports above this
level.
Eight Latin American governments immediately expressed their 'absolute
rejection' of December's agreement in principle, and said they would
challenge it through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The EC move is intended to unify the community's disparate banana regime in
line with the principles of its single market; protect high-cost
'Euro-banana' producers from former colonies and outlying territories like
Spain's Canary Islands and French Martinique; and bring its system of
protection into line with the Gatt's Uruguay Round trade reform
negotiations, which require tariffs on all farm produce, that subsequently
can be reduced.
The EC countries hostile to the plan consume the bigger and cheaper Latin
American bananas, but had been expected to go along with the plan in the
light of these three exigencies.
'We hope the political commitments entered into in December still stand,'
said a senior official from the UK, which was then holding the presidency of
the EC and so brokered last December's deal.
As community farm ministers met yesterday, the odds were nevertheless
perceived to be slightly against a blocking minority coalescing.
Denmark, as current president of the EC, was expected to stay out of the
dispute, since the presidency's primary goal is to conciliate. Mr Rene
Steichen, the new farm commissioner, may have some influence in restraining
his native Luxembourg, whose agriculture minister he was until January.
Germany, moreover, senior commission officials argue, appears to have the
impression that the 2m tonnes quota is semi-fixed, whereas the commission's
intention is to adjust it on at least a monthly basis in line with demand.
Germany, its allies, and the Latin Americans complain, however, that the
quota is well below the 2.4m tonnes of dollar fruit the EC imported in 1991,
equivalent to two thirds of total consumption. There is further controversy
about plans to allocate a third of dollar fruit licences to traditional
Eurobanana importers, enabling them thereby to cross-subsidise their own
operations.
However, Latin American imports surged by a third between 1988 and 1991, in
what the commission describes as 'speculative imports' by exporters
positioning themselves for the EC single market, which started up last
month.
Ministers were not expected to vote on the controversy until today.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Holding the line on farm reform
 -Tough challenges facing the new EC commissioner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RENE Steichen of Luxembourg, the European Community's new farm
commissioner, has taken over the most powerful job in European agriculture
at a peculiarly difficult time.
Farmers across Europe are blaming their declining incomes and the continuing
exodus from the land on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, as
well as agreements with the US within the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade's Uruguay Round world trade negotiations, to cut food export
subsidies.
Mr Steichen's predicament is easily summed up. Farmers are up in arms about
measures - CAP reform and the Gatt settlement - which have not yet been
applied. His predecessor, Mr Ray MacSharry of Ireland, won plaudits for the
most radical overhaul of the CAP in its 30-year history and for averting a
trade war with the US within an overall farm trade settlement which was
arguably beyond the best the EC could have hoped for.
The new commissioner has none of the glory for these achievements; he merely
has to implement them.
He can look forward to brickbats from the farmers for so doing, and sniping
from agriculture economists and pundits if he appears to cede any ground to
farmers under either the reform or the Gatt trade talks.
As one agriculture official at the European Commission puts it: 'After last
year things are as tight as they ever could be, and anything that happens
under Steichen will only loosen them.'
Mr Steichen is alive to this danger. 'They say I'm a Trojan Horse for
France,' he remarks with certain amusement. It is France's militant farmers
and its unpopular Socialist government, which is desperate to placate them,
who have proved most determined to block a Gatt deal and pick away at the
CAP reform.
Certainly France, the EC's agricultural superpower, was uncomfortable with
the abrasive Mr MacSharry.
The Irishman took a firm hold on Directorate-General VI - the powerful
Brussels agriculture department previously considered an outpost of the
Paris farm ministry - and ruthlessly faced down a succession of French
agriculture ministers who were convinced they would get their way until the
moment of defeat.
'It's not clear,' one senior commission official says, 'whether Steichen can
make his own views DG VI's views.' He adds that despite the new
commissioner's own agricultural policy background, his personal staff is
top-heavy with generalists - although headed as chef de cabinet by Mr Jim
Cloos, the highly-regarded former Luxembourg ambassador to the EC.
Mr Steichen, a 50-year old French-educated solicitor and Christian Democrat,
looks as though he will be more emollient. He joined the Luxembourg cabinet
in 1984 as state secretary for agriculture, taking over as minister from
1989. He comes across as relaxed, with a light touch, and quick to smile. He
chaired the farm council with ease during the stormy first half of 1991,
when Mr MacSharry presented his reform to universal vituperation. From
France's point of view, it is a welcome change that he speaks French. One of
his top aides says that if Mr MacSharry was the man needed to bludgeon
reform through, Mr Steichen is more the sort of man needed to put reform to
work.
The commissioner insists he will be in regular contact with all EC national
farm organisations; last Friday he left officials from Britain's National
Farmers' Union with the impression he was more accessible and receptive than
Mr MacSharry.
But in presenting this year's farm price package, Mr Steichen has already
signalled that he is no soft touch. His underlining that there would be no
extra money to buy off national farm interests could almost have been
designed for France, which is still pushing for bigger off-sets to the
price, output and export cuts in the CAP and Gatt packages.
A running sore for months to come will be the commission's efforts to
demonstrate, over protestations led by France and Ireland, that the cuts
required under the Gatt deal are compatible with the CAP reform.
Mr Steichen nailed his colours to the mast in a keynote speech last month.
'The figures I have show that, overall, the concessions made by the EC
(within the Gatt) - and the ones made to us as well, which we too often
forget - are within the framework of the reform and guarantee the security
of the CAP.'
Like Mr MacSharry, he believes the EC-US deal on farm trade means
international recognition of the CAP. He is anxious to wrap up the oilseeds
agreement with the US quickly, and for an early conclusion to the Uruguay
Round of Gatt negotiations, in order to shore up these agreements. For
without that recognition, all the community's main commodity regimes would
be vulnerable to challenge through the Gatt. And that, in the longer run,
could mean curtains for the CAP, reformed or unreformed.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ polishes apples for Japanese
sales drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND'S apple growers are in a buoyant mood as they pick the new
season's fruit. Thanks to the Japanese the export outlook has never been
rosier.
From June New Zealand looks set to be the first major apple producer in the
world to be able to export its fruit to Japan, which has a keen appetite for
the fruit. This depends on final acceptance by the Japanese that New Zealand
can effectively control various moth parasites.
New Zealand exporters acknowledge, however, that gaining a sizeable share of
this market will not be easy: for a start the Japanese prefer larger rosy
coloured apples of a type they do not now produce, and the condition must be
superb. Luckily New Zealand, which has been pioneering new varieties for
world markets, believes it could have the answer in an unnamed variety,
still known as GS2085. In the meantime exporters hope the Japanese might be
persuaded to eat Granny Smiths, Royal Gala, and some other export varieties.
The optimism follows the agreement in principle reached late last year on
the treatment of New Zealand apple pests. Mr Joe Pope, chief executive of
the Apple and Pear Marketing Board, says he is 'very confident' that the
agreement will soon be formalised. 'But it represents a huge challenge.
Japan is the most demanding market in the world, and our success there
depends only on our ability to perform.'
He says that apples are at present a high-priced luxury in Japan. The large
blemish-free fruit produced domestically are virtually hand reared: as each
apple is grown it is put into a succession of paper bags to protect it.
Apples are sold individually, with a family dividing one up between them.
Mr Pope says New Zealand will have to develop varieties for this market,
although Royal Gala would seem suitable, as would the new variety GS2085.
'That will have considerable potential there,' he says.
At present only Korea is permitted to export tiny quantities of apples to
Japan so New Zealand has scored something of a coup, Mr Pope claims. He
warns, however, that the US is also working hard at securing a similar
agreement with Japan and might be as little as six months behind New
Zealand.

<TEXT>
THE INDIAN federal government has sanctioned an additional cotton export
quota of 500,000 bales (170 kg each) for the cotton season which began in
September 1992.
Earlier, anticipating a bumper cotton crop and, consequently, a domestic
price collapse, the government released 1m bales for export.
Officials say that the only way domestic cotton prices can be maintained at
above the recommended minimum level is by stepping up exports. World prices
for cotton are higher than Indian prices by at least 10 per cent at present.
In 1991-92 India imported 300,000 bales of cotton.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian oil reserves estimate
raised by 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORWEGIAN Petroleum Directorate, the industry watchdog, has upgraded its
estimate of recoverable reserves from the country's continental shelf by 12
per cent to 10bn tonnes of oil equivalent
The previous assessment, released in 1988, was by far the most pessimistic
prognosis on Norway's future prospects as a leading petroleum nation ever
issued. But it has proved far off the mark.
The directorate then predicted that there was limited sales potential for
Norway's vast natural gas resources. But it now seems that Norway's gas
sales to the European continent could more than double from the present
annual level of 25bn cubic metres to about 60bn-70bn cu m by the turn of the
century.
About 11 per cent, or 1.13bn tonnes of the resources have been produced and
sold, the directorate says, and existing production technology will allow
for about 4.5bn tonnes of remaining discovered resources to be extracted. Of
this, 40 per cent is thought to be oil and 60 per cent gas.
At the current annual extraction rate of 80m tonnes, oil resources will last
another 45 years while gas resources will last for about two centuries at an
annual production rate of 25m tonnes.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Grass roots opposition
threatens exchange merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHICAGO Board of Trade's proposed take-over of the New York Commodity
Exchange (Comex) is on the verge of being derailed by belligerent Comex
floor traders who believe the deal unfairly benefits the CBoT.
While clearing firms at both exchanges favour the plan for the cost savings
it will provide, floor traders are angry that they have been asked to give
up their membership equity and voting rights for yet-to-be determined
benefits of sharing the CBoT name and an alliance with the world's largest
futures exchange.
Despite the increasingly institutional nature of futures trading, floor
traders still wield the clout in exchange politics and their approval is
crucial for the success of the merger plan.
'I think the offer is insulting, it annoys me,' says Mr Vince Zuccarelli, a
Comex floor trader and one of the take-over's more vocal opponents. 'The
CBoT wants to buy the Comex without putting up any funds. In fact, they want
to buy the Comex with Comex funds. What is it the Board of Trade is bringing
to the party?'
The CBoT has proposed to employ its marketing and administrative expertise
to boost Comex trading volume and use funds saved from combining operations
to form a trust fund to buy out Comex seats. At a packed member meeting at
Comex last week, Mr Patrick Arbor, the CBoT Chairman, was pressed for a
financial commitment to the Comex, which he proved reluctant to give.
Mr Arbor has since described that meeting as 'emotionally charged' and has
stuck to his position. 'Nothing in this deal is carved in granite,' he said,
'but there are some things that are deal breakers.' Specifically, he said
the CBOT was not prepared to cover any potential Comex losses or cost
overruns. 'Quite frankly, we're businessmen,' he said.
The CBoT has sent the plan to a committee of attorneys and accountants. Mr
Arbor says it could take 18 months to complete the contract. In the meantime
officials at both exchanges will attempt to soft-sell the plan to Comex
members.
Mr Richard Sandor, a derivatives executive at Kidder Peabody and the
architect of the takeover proposal, will pitch the benefits of the plan to
Comex traders at a meeting this afternoon. He is likely to encounter traders
who share Mr Zuccarelli's belief that a merger with a New York exchange is
preferable to a long-distance marriage with the CBoT.
New York's five futures exchanges have a history of squabbling with one
another. However, the CBoT's take-over bid could force local consolidation
even if it fails. If the CBoT plan is refused, another suitor will emerge,
predicts Mr Lou Guttman, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange and a
Comex member. 'Comex cannot continue independently as it has the last
several years,' he said. Any exchange in the country would be willing to
take Comex on the terms proposed by the CBoT, Mr Guttman added.

Robusta COFFEE prices closed down heavily at the London Future's and Options
Exchange in the wake of Monday night's late 5 cent fall in the New York
arabica market. London continued to be less volatile than New York, partly
because of lower fund participation. New York prices fell further in early
trading on renewed technical selling, but later were recovering some of the
losses. London dealers said the market remained very edgy. Technical factors
were still driving prices, with fundamental influences pushed firmly into
the background. On the LME ALUMINIUM and NICKEL prices, which touched
respective five and four-week highs, gave up some of the gains by the close
as the higher levels attracted profit-taking. Dealers said the strength of
both metals appeared to be technically motivated, with little news or
physical activity to justify advances. On Nymex PALLADIUM futures were
hovering near life-of-contract highs at midday as widespread worries over
near-term supplies remained the dominant factor.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts suffer jitters on fears of rising UK
inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION worries depressed the UK government bond market and pushed gilt
prices down by as much as half a point, but the market later recovered most
of the losses as investors bought on weakness.
The release of worse-than-expected producer input prices for January
heightened fears of rising inflation. Input prices for manufacturing jumped
1.5 per cent in January - giving a year-on-year rise of 7.2 per cent -
whereas the market had expected to see a 0.5 per cent rise on the month.
The news helped to push the March Liffe gilt futures contract down from its
opening level of 101.08 to a low of 100.27, but the futures contract later
recovered to reach 101.05 by late afternoon. In the cash market, prices were
depressed across the curve, but picked up as investors bought on weakness.
BELGIAN government bonds were marked down around a point, with dealers
pointing to the recent easing of the Belgian franc against the D-Mark and
concern about the country's heavy borrowing requirement.
The Belgian franc came under pressure last week before the German Bundesbank
cut its key interest rates. 'The recent easing of tensions within the ERM
and return of confidence to the French franc has killed off interest in the
Belgian bond market,' said one dealer. 'Belgium was seen before as one of
the hard core currencies in the D-Mark bloc, but now yields on French and
Belgian 10-year paper are the same,' he added.
JAPANESE government bonds continued to rally strongly, helped by the
combination of a sharp rise in the yen against the dollar, stock market
weakness and another round of bond-buying by the finance ministry.
The yen strengthened from Y124.35 to the dollar, to Y121.75 yesterday
spurred by market talk that Japan's trade partners were stepping up pressure
for a stronger yen. The Nikkei index fell below the psychologically
important 17,000 level, but ended the day 259.46 lower at 17,022.27.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.29 per cent, corresponding to
the low price of the day, and moved to 4.23 per cent before ending at 4.245
per cent. The June futures contract, which took over as the new benchmark
yesterday, rose from 109.14 to a high of 109.54 before closing at 109.50.
THE AUSTRALIAN government bond market closed firmer as prime minister Mr
Paul Keating yesterday unveiled proposals to cut corporate tax in an attempt
to spur investment and employment growth. Mr Keating promised that a
re-elected Labour government would cut the company tax rate to 33 per cent
from 39 per cent, and would give an immediate 10 per cent taxation allowance
for business investment.
In addition, he announced that the government now expects a budget deficit
of ADollars 15.9bn in the year ending June 30, against an original targeted
deficit of ADollars 13.39bn. Most of the difference will be funded through
extra bond sales. Bond prices edged up as the market had already discounted
the financial package and participants covered short positions.
US Treasury prices were flat to lower yesterday after a successful, if
uneventful, afternoon auction of Dollars 15.5bn in three-year notes.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 105
5/32 , yielding 7.196 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was also slightly weaker, down  3/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 4.199 per
cent.
In the absence of important economic data, all eyes were on the note and
bond auctions. In early trading prices eased, primarily because given the
recent strength in Treasuries, market participants were reluctant to bid up
prices before the first tranche of the refunding programme for fear of
scaring away potential retail buyers of the new issue.
The three-year sale was subsequently completed at an average yield of 4.73
per cent, much as expected. Prices recovered some of their lost ground after
the auction, but news of a strong store sales from the Johnson Redbook
report ensured the market's bias remained on the downward side.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Investors seek advice in
United Newspapers row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW has erupted over the treatment of investors in a United Newspapers
issue of convertible preference shares. Some investors, who lost payment of
the annual dividend on the shares, are currently taking legal advice on the
matter.
The Pounds 105m issue, which was exchangeable into ordinary shares in
Reuters Holdings, was called for early redemption by the issuer last
December. The decision to call the issue forced investors still holding the
preference shares to convert into Reuters shares. By doing so, they
forfeited payment of the fixed 8 per cent dividend due on the preference
shares, but, because of the timing, they also missed receiving payment of
the Reuters share dividend.
There are just seven days each year when the issuer can take advantage of
the documentation to redeem the bonds without paying the dividend. Investors
claim that this is a loophole which has saved United Newspapers an estimated
Pounds 8.1m in dividend payments at their expense.
'We believe that this sort of action is bad market practice, misleading
investors who do not read the small print,' said one investor in the issue.
However, an official at United Newspapers said that the company had taken
every care to follow correct procedure. 'Before we called the issue, we made
sure we understood the the terms of the issue required, and then followed
the terms of the issue precisely,' he said.
There is similar wording on an Pounds 80m Smith &amp; Nephew issue of
convertible preference shares due 2004. Officials at Smith &amp; Nephew declined
to comment on the issue.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Eurodollar sector attracts most
activity on quiet day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Eurodollar sector attracted most of the activity in a quiet day for new
issues yesterday, as syndicate managers kept their vigil for a
widely-expected dollar deal from Denmark.
Separately, the World Bank confirmed market talk of an imminent global yen
bond issue, which it plans to launch in late February. The underwriting
group will be led by IBJ International, Morgan Stanley and Nikko Securities.
Syndicate managers said the World Bank's third global bond offering in yen
was likely to raise Y200bn and to have a maturity of between seven to 10
years.
There were reports that the Danish deal was still waiting for ministerial
approval but syndicate managers hoped that it would be launched by the end
of the week. One syndicate manager said that any further delay would result
in less favourable terms for Denmark, since the US Treasury's quarterly
refunding auctions this week were likely to temper investor demand.
Among yesterday's Eurodollar deals, the Dollars 300m seven-year offering
from Sandoz Overseas Finance arranged by CSFB was said to be the most
successful. Although the Swiss chemicals company has no rating and the
maturity of the bond exceeded the current preference among Swiss investors
for maturities of five years or less, the deal went in 'two minutes,'
according to one manager involved in the deal, reflecting the company's good
name in the market. The bond was priced at 38 basis points above comparable
US Treasuries, and after the syndicate was broken, the spread tightened to
less than 35 points.
By contrast, distribution of the Dollars 200m 10-year bond for Norddeutsche
Landesbank was 'slow,' according to an official at the lead manager, Salomon
Brothers International.
Several convertible issues in various currencies were launched yesterday.
Sun Alliance, the composite insurer, was the second UK company in less than
a week to bring a sterling subordinated Euroconvertible issue. On February
2, Northern Foods, the dairy and convenience food company, raised Pounds
91.28m through a similar issue, also arranged by NM Rothschild.
As with Northern Foods, demand among investors for high-yielding instruments
enabled Sun Alliance to increase the size of its issue to Pounds 155m from
Pounds 140m. The issue has a 15-year maturity but may be redeemed after five
years.
The semi-annual coupon was set at 7 1/4 per cent, at the lower end of the
indicated range of 7 1/4 -7 1/2 per cent, and the conversion price at 390p
represented a premium of 15.38 per cent over the ordinary share price at the
time of pricing, at the high end of the indicated range of 14-16 per cent.

system fulfil its initial objective to be a round-the-clock vehicle for
futures trading.
The lack of terminals in Japan has hampered Globex since its launch last
summer, according to Mr Leo Melamed, chairman. The system was designed to
allow traders to pass their derivatives 'book' around the globe, around the
clock.
Japan's absence interrupted the flow of that trading, leaving a gap in the
Asian time zone, Mr Melamed said. Globex volume has been averaging just
3,000 contracts a day and negotiations to add non-US futures exchanges to
the system have lagged.
Globex is jointly owned by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade and Reuters Holdings. So far about 80 per cent of the around
200 active Globex terminals are installed in the US, with the remainder in
London and Paris.
Globex officials said 28 terminals will be installed in the offices of CME
and CBOT member firms in Tokyo, and that trading on those terminals should
begin soon. They said additional terminals would be activated in Hong Kong
during March, and in Geneva later this spring.
Notional principal amount of foreign currency and interest rate swaps
exceeded Dollars 1,470bn in the six months ended June, 1992, up 44 per cent,
according to the International Swap Dealers Association. However, despite
the overall gain, foreign currency swap volume declined. Interest rate swaps
accounted for Dollars 1,320bn (up 53 per cent) and currency swaps Dollars
156bn (down 7 per cent), ISDA said.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Blackstone may acquire Univa in
CDollars 1bn venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BLACKSTONE, the New York-based investment group, may acquire Univa, Canada's
second largest food distributor, in a deal worth just over CDollars 1bn
(USDollars 793m).
Univa, with annual sales of CDollars 6.5bn, is a wholesale and retail food
distributor with subsidiaries across Canada and in California, and is second
to the Toronto-based Loblaw.
In the nine months to October 31 Univa's net profits were CDollars 29.4m, or
34 cents a share, on sales of CDollars 5.1bn. The figures reflected vicious
competition, particularly in eastern Canada.
Mr Bertin Nadeau, who for the past 11 years has controlled 26 per cent of
Univa through a holding company, Unigesco, plans a joint venture with
Blackstone to offer CDollars 11 a share cash for all Univa's 94m common
shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. This would be about 45 per cent
above the average Univa market price over the past three weeks. Thus the
value of the bid is CDollars 1.03bn.
Univa's next biggest shareholder is the Sobey family of Halifax, Novia
Scotia, with 25 per cent. The family usually votes with Mr Nadeau. The
Caisse de Depot, the Quebec Pension Plan's investment arm, holds about 12
per cent including conversion rights.
If the deal goes through the joint venture is structured so that Univa will
be owned 80 per cent by Blackstone and undisclosed private international
investors and 20 per cent by Unigesco.
Mr Stephen Schwarzman, president of Blackstone, said his investment group
would sell its Univa shares over a three to seven-year period via public
offerings and Unigesco would buy back control of Univa. After seven years
the joint venture would be dissolved.
He said that Univa management would continue unchanged and Univa would get
full financial backing for a three-year CDollars 230m modernisation
programme in the highly competitive eastern Canada market.
Unigesco, which owns a hardware retailing group and food service units,
would sell its 26 per cent of Univa into the joint venture for CDollars
246m, which would be used to reduce its own heavy debt.
Blackstone will provide CDollars 375m for the bid, with the balance borrowed
partly from Canadian and US banks.
Univa will set up a committee of independent directors to evaluate the bid
and report to shareholders.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Goodyear net income slips to
Dollars 88m

<TEXT>
GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the only surviving US-owned tyre company, yesterday
said its board had approved a two-for-one stock split and a 20 per cent hike
in its quarterly dividend payment to 30 cents a share on a pre-split basis.
The company recorded underlying fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 102.8m,
or Dollars 1.43 a share, excluding extraordinary items and accounting
changes. This compares with Dollars 99.3m, or Dollars 1.55, a year earlier,
when the company had fewer shares outstanding.
Including one-time items, Goodyear's net income stood at Dollars 87.5m, or
Dollars 1.22, in the fourth quarter against Dollars 105.1m, or Dollars 1.65,
last year. Sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 2.93bn from Dollars 2.78bn.
The results were in line with Goodyear's earlier fourth-quarter predictions
and its shares eased Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 70 3/8 at close of trading in
New York.
The proposed stock split and dividend increase will be put to a shareholder
vote at Goodyear's annual meeting on April 5. During 1992, Goodyear took a
one-time net charge of Dollars 1.01bn on the adoption of two non-cash
accounting changes. As a result, Goodyear posted a net loss of Dollars
658.6m, or Dollars 9.22 a share, in 1992, compared with net income of
Dollars 96.6m, or Dollars 1.61.
Stripping out the charges and other one-time items, Goodyear earned Dollars
367.3m, or Dollars 5.14, in the year compared with Dollars 74.5m, or Dollars
1.24, in 1991. Sales advanced 8 per cent to Dollars 11.78bn from Dollars
10.91bn.
During the fourth quarter, Goodyear had gains of Dollars 75.9m from the sale
of its polyester resin assets which was partly offset by charges of Dollars
39.6m for workforce restructuring and charges of Dollars 15.8m for the
planned sale of its roofing busi ness and other items.
Goodyear's debt stood at Dollars 1.9bn at the end of 1992, compared with
Dollars 2.6bn at the end of 1991 and Dollars 3.7bn in mid-1991. As a result,
the company's interest expense fell to Dollars 232.9m at the end of the year
from Dollars 217.8m a year earlier.
Selling, administrative and general expenses rose to Dollars 8.97bn at the
year end from Dollars 8.41bn a year earlier, reflecting higher advertising
spending. Goodyear's tyre sales rose 6 per cent in the fourth quarter to
Dollars 2.4bn, but operating income dropped 39 per cent to Dollars 125.9m.
The oil transportation segment had operating income of Dollars 347,000 in
the fourth quarter compared with a loss of Dollars 5.4m a year earlier.

Dollars 62m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHIRLPOOL, the world's biggest maker of large domestic appliances, yesterday
posted an unexpectedly strong 55 per cent improvement in fourth-quarter net
profits to Dollars 62m, or 87 cents a share, from Dollars 40m, or 58 cents,
in 1991.
The company, which fully owns the former Philips appliance business in
Europe, saw revenues rise 8 per cent to Dollars 1.84bn from Dollars 1.71bn.
Whirlpool's earnings before taxes and other items were 39 per cent higher at
Dollars 104m against Dollars 75m. Shares in Whirlpool climbed Dollars 2 7/8
to Dollars 51 5/8 , a 52-week high. For the full year, Whirlpool net income
rose 20 per cent to Dollars 205m, or Dollars 2.90, on revenues which grew 8
per cent to Dollars 7.3bn.
In 1991, the company earned Dollars 170m, or Dollars 2.45, on revenues of
Dollars 6.76bn.
Mr David Whitwam, chair man and chief executive, said all three of the
company's regional home-appliance seg ments had a record year in 1992. In
North America, revenues, operating margin and earnings increased
significantly, helped by a 7 per cent rise in industry-wide shipments in the
region. Industry shipments are expected to rise another 3 per cent to 4 per
cent this year.
Analysts were impressed by the company's performance in a difficult European
market. Whirlpool said its shipments in Europe improved, in spite of
industry trends towards lower shipments.
Whirlpool's overseas divi sion, posted profits in Latin America in spite of
an equity loss of 14 cents a share in Brazil, against earnings of 4 cents a
share in 1991. The company realised a small equity profit in the second half
of 1992 from its Brazilian affiliates through cuts in operating costs and a
rise in market share.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Setback for GM over assembly
plant ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, the US car group, yesterday suffered an unusual setback in
its efforts to slash its North American production costs when a Michigan
court ordered it to keep open an assembly plant scheduled for closure.
The plant involved is Willow Run, at Ypsilanti, west of Detroit. GM
announced a year ago that the works would be shut in 1993 and its output
consolidated at a plant in Arlington, Texas.
Yesterday, however, a Michigan circuit court judge enjoined GM from moving
production of its Caprice station wagon from Ypsilanti to Arlington.
The judge supported a challenge by Ypsilanti Township, which argued GM had
violated provisions of tax breaks given in the 1980s in the hope of keeping
the plant open.
Mr Lee Schutzman, an attorney for GM, said the ruling was unprecedented and
the company would appeal. GM has already started transferring workers from
the plant to Arlington.
When the judge's ruling was announced, members of the United Auto Workers
union filled the court room with cheers.
The UAW has reacted particularly bitterly to the closing of Ypsilanti and
accused GM of 'whip-sawing' - playing the Michigan and Texas plants off
against one another in the hope of extracting maximum concessions from the
union.
Mr Doug Winters, an attorney for the township, said: 'GM for years has asked
for a level playing field in terms of global competition, and all we ever
asked for was a level playing field to present our case. Fortunately, we had
a judge with enough courage to give us that.'
The closure is part of GM's plan to shut 21 assembly and parts plants by the
mid-1990s in an attempt to return its loss-making North American operations
to profit.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Volksbank hit by bad loan
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS VOLKSBANK, the object of an agreed SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1bn) takeover bid
from the parent company of rival Credit Suisse, has reported a loss of
SFr68m in 1992 compared with a SFr68m net profit in 1991 because of nearly
doubled provisions for bad loans.
The actual loss was much higher, but was softened by the release of the
remaining SFr292m in hidden reserves. The directors have recommended that
the dividend be passed.
Volksbank said CS Holding had completed its examination of the bank and
confirmed its takeover offer, on the basis of three registered shares of CS
for 10 Volksbank registered shares.
Volksbank will seek the approval of its shareholders on March 11 to
transform itself from a co-operative into a joint stock company, converting
each of its co-operative shares into 10 registered shares.
Mr Werner Sigg, a director of Volksbank, said the rationalisation plan
agreed between the two banks called for the elimination of between 100 and
150 of their combined 400 branches in Switzerland and the loss of 2,000
jobs. While the two would maintain separate identities in Switzerland, the
Volksbank international network would be folded into that of CS.
Mr Sigg said the resulting savings would be of the order of SFr250m a year
by 1995, roughly 8.5 per cent of the operating costs of the two banks in
1991.
Mr Erwin Sigrist, executive vice-president of Volksbank, said the large
growth in loan loss provisions last year from SFr394m to SFr720m was due
mainly to the negative impact of the recession in Switzerland on small and
medium-sized businesses.
At December 31, 1992, the bank had total assets of SFr46.1bn compared with
SFr46.5bn a year earlier.
Capital was unchanged at SFr2.2bn.

ANHEUSER-BUSCH, the largest US brewer, lifted fourth-quarter net profits to
Dollars 161.6m, or 58 cents a share, from Dollars 159.2m, or 55 cents, on
sales of Dollars 2.73bn against Dollars 2.67bn, agencies report from St
Louis.
Full-year net profits slipped to Dollars 917.5m, or Dollars 3.22 a share,
from Dollars 939.8m, or Dollars 3.26, after a Dollars 76.7m charge for
changes in accounting practices.
The group expects to report first-quarter 1993 beer sales volume slightly
below first-quarter 1992. This was due to the phase-in of production at its
new Cartersville, Georgia, brewery beginning in the spring.
The beer maker said it usually builds inventories at the wholesaler level in
the first half of each year to meet peak consumer demand during the summer.
Availability of the extra capacity at Cartersville would reduce shipping
requirements during the first two quarters of 1993.
While first-quarter sales volume was expected to slip, volume in the second
half of 1993 would be substantially higher than the second half of 1992,
providing full-year volume growth of 1 to 2 per cent.
For the first quarter of 1993, Anheuser-Busch expects sales to retailers,
which are regarded as better indicators of underlying consumer demand, to
increase more than 1 per cent.

AIR Canada has suspended talks with Trinidad and Tobago Airways to acquire a
stake in the Caribbean operator of the BWIA International airline. The move
leaves the state-owned Trinidadian company continuing its two-year search
for a partnership with an international carrier.
The negotiations with Air Canada followed the failure of talks with other
airlines, including British Airways and Delta Airlines, to buy into BWIA.
Government officials said Air Canada's decision had nothing to do with
BWIA's financial performance, but because Air Canada's management resources
were too thin.
BWIA had a net loss of USDollars 15.6m last year, following a loss of
Dollars 24.2m in 1991.

<TEXT>
NEWS Corporation, the international media group controlled by Mr Rupert
Murdoch, has announced a 20 per cent increase in its dividend following
continued earnings resurgence for the six months ended December 1992.
Net earnings before abnormals almost doubled, to ADollars 490.1m (USDollars
328.7m) from ADollars 252.2m on turnover little changed at ADollars 5.33bn,
against ADollars 5.27bn in the same six months a year earlier.
News Corp also plans a three-for-one bonus issue and has declared a 1.5 cent
a share interim dividend, payable on the bonus shares. That represents a 20
per cent increase on the 5 cents a share interim paid on pre-bonus capital
last year.
Central to the profits performance was a 22 per cent reduction in interest
expenses to ADollars 387.4m and a ADollars 155.8m turnround to a surplus in
the contribution from equity investments.
Equity-accounted investments - principally British Sky Broadcasting, the UK
satellite television venture; Ansett, the Australian airline; and Pacific
Magazines and Printing - turned a ADollars 62.7m loss into a ADollars 93.1m
profit.
News Corp earned higher profits from its newspaper, magazine and inserts and
television businesses, but contributions from both film and book publishing
operations were weaker.
Newspapers remained the largest contributor, with operating income rising
21.7 per cent to ADollars 349.1m.
Magazines and inserts lifted income from ADollars 170.7m to ADollars 208.4m,
while television rose 29.6 per cent from ADollars 124.4m to ADollars 161.2m.
However, income from films more than halved from ADollars 67.7m to ADollars
33.3m and book publishing was down 27.5 per cent at ADollars 113.6m.
On a geographic basis, the US remained the company's biggest earnings
centre, lifting operating income 4.4 per cent to ADollars 492.7m. News said
profits from Fox Broadcasting and Fox Television rose almost 20 per cent,
but earnings at Twentieth Century Fox fell 55 per cent.
In the UK, operating income rose by 19.1 per cent from Dollars A471.8m to
ADollars 207.2m following newspaper cost reductions and circulation
increases. Weekly revenues of BSkyB's 50 per cent-owned satellite company
were up by 79 per cent.
Operating income from Australia and the Pacific Basin region fell by 16.8
per cent to ADollars 167.5m, but operating profits rose 15 per cent at the
Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post and 28 per cent in Australian
metropolitan newspapers.
The group's six-month net earnings are arrived at after tax of ADollars
53.5m (against ADollars 12.5m) and depreciation of ADollars 115.1m (ADollars
115.2m). This excluded an abnormal loss of ADollars 37.3m (Dollars 103.1m
profit).

Australian election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S federal election campaign yesterday produced variations in plans
to privatise two of the country's biggest government-controlled companies,
the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas.
Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, announced plans to float a
further 19 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank, which is due to release
interim results today.
But the planned float of the government's 75 per cent interest in Qantas,
the Australian international airline, originally scheduled for June, is now
unlikely to take place before October.
Mr Keating said he hoped to raise more than ADollars 1bn (USDollars 670m)
from the flotation of 19 per cent of Commonwealth Bank in 1994-95.
This would leave the bank majority government-owned, as ADollars 1.3bn was
raised in 1991 through a 30 per cent float.
The government is hoping to raise about ADollars 2bn through the Qantas
float, following the recent sale of 25 per cent of the airline to British
Airways for ADollars 665m.
The minister for finance, Mr Ralph Willis, said the delay in the Qantas
float would also allow the airline to obtain an independent credit rating
before severing its links with the government.

Ansett's wings - The airline's financial position remains parlous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS time running out for Ansett, the Australian airline jointly owned by Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and TNT, the transport conglomerate?
Nobody disputes that Ansett's star has fallen a long way over the past three
years, beginning with a year-long pilots' strike in 1989-90 which disrupted
schedules and scared away passengers.
A few months after the strike ended, domestic aviation was deregulated,
triggering a three-way fares battle between Ansett, government-owned
Australian Airlines and Compass, an independent carrier which collapsed
under the competitive pressure but has since been relaunched.
At the same time, Ansett was trying to cope with a two-year recession which
further depressed fares and trading margins, leading to net losses of
ADollars 336m (USDollars 225.3m)in the two years to last June.
When the airline was making big profits - it reported net earnings of
ADollars 184m in 1987-88 - its critics used to say that it was being given
an easy ride by the government, which allowed only Ansett and Australian
Airlines to offer national services.
That era ended with deregulation. But the government twisted the sword last
year when it suddenly decided, contrary to earlier undertakings, to merge
Australian Airlines with Qantas, and to sell both to the private sector.
The privatisation process, which began in December with the sale of 25 per
cent of the merged airline to British Airways, is expected to be completed
later this year with a public float of the remaining capital. But the damage
to Ansett is already clear.
Not only does the airline's main competitor now have a strong parent and
reduced debt, it will also increase its market share at Ansett's expense
through booking arrangements with BA and Qantas, which account for more than
45 per cent of in-bound passengers. Both Qantas and BA formerly had
alliances with Ansett.
In addition, Ansett faces further encroachment on its domestic market share
by Air New Zealand, following an inter-governmental agreement last year on
the creation of a single aviation market in Australia and New Zealand. Air
NZ is already flying from Brisbane to Thailand and Taiwan, and may begin
Australian domestic flights later this year.
News Corp and TNT have remained supportive of Ansett, even though both have
faced serious problems of their own. However, Mr Murdoch has said that News
Corp's 50 per cent stake is for sale if a buyer can be found.
Mr David Mortimer, who last year replaced the long-serving Sir Peter Abeles
as TNT managing director, is preoccupied with the group's struggle against
recession. But he has also made clear that part of TNT's stake is for sale.
Ansett has a well-equipped fleet of modern aircraft, and about 55 per cent
of the domestic market - including associated regional airlines. It has also
applied for rights to compete with Qantas on international routes.
Permission to fly to Malaysia and Indonesia has already been granted, and
applications for flights to Japan and other Asian countries are being
considered.
So far, however, the search for fresh equity has failed. Singapore
International Airlines (SIA), which bid unsuccessfully for a minority stake
in Qantas, has said publicly it was not interested, and so has Cathay
Pacific, the Hong Kong-based carrier.
Ansett is still talking to SIA, Malaysian Airlines and Air NZ, which was
also an early bidder for a stake in Qantas. Air NZ is viewed by many
analysts as the most likely partner because an alliance would increase its
access to international routes commencing in Australia.
However, an investment in Ansett by Air NZ would be frowned upon by Qantas,
which holds a 19.9 per cent stake in the NZ airline. The NZ commerce
commission might also seek to block such an alliance because of concerns
that it could lessen competition in New Zealand, where Ansett is the only
domestic competitor to Air NZ.
Ansett has been trying hard to get back on an even keel. It has signed
marketing agreements with a raft of foreign airlines, including Lufthansa of
Germany, Cathay Pacific, All Nippon Airways of Japan, United Airlines of the
US and Alitalia of Italy.
Mr Ken Cowley, the News Corp director who took over as chairman of Ansett
last year, has begun raising cash and cutting costs by selling non-core
assets and merging regional carriers with the main airline.
Ansett earned operating profits of ADollars 6.5m in the three months ended
September, and is believed to have improved on that in the following
quarter. But the airline's financial position remains parlous.
It faces repayments of ADollars 240m this year on total net debt of ADollars
2.28bn, and has only about ADollars 70m in the form of cash and unused loan
facilities. Analysts say it will need a cash injection of at least ADollars
150m to meet the bills.
Executives say too much attention is being paid to the potential cash
crunch. If necessary, they say, the money will be provided by the airline's
parents - mainly News Corp. However, even if Mr Murdoch bails out Ansett in
the short term, the airline will still need fresh equity if it is to
capitalise on international opportunities and avoid being left behind by
Qantas in the medium term.
Ansett's rights to international routes cost virtually nothing to acquire,
but will be expensive to take up. Some of the airline's Boeing 767 aircraft
could be diverted from domestic services to the shorter international
routes, but analysts say it is hard to see how Ansett could finance the
acquisition of bigger aircraft for the Japanese routes.
'The future looks very difficult for them,' says Mr Julian Mulcahy, aviation
analyst at ANZ McCaughan. 'The airline was profitable in the first half, and
that may give them some help in dealing with their backers, but they do need
an equity injection in the next 12 months. If they don't get it, who knows
what will happen?'

SAUDI American Bank (Samba), the Saudi Arabian joint-venture bank, has
reported a 21 per cent rise in net income for 1992 to SR910m (Dollars
242.45m).
The bank, which is 30 per cent owned by Citicorp of the US, said that
profits were led by a 15 per cent rise in earnings to SR193m, which it said
marked earnings growth in all sectors.
A gross dividend of SR682.7m, or a net SR55 a share, is to be paid.
Assets rose 5 per cent to SR38.2bn, with the bank's loan portfolio up 21 per
cent at SR11.6bn, almost all from domestic business.
Customer deposits rose 2 per cent to SR28.3bn. Samba added SR34m to loan
loss reserves.
Public Bank, the third largest commercial banking group in Malaysia, has
staged a 33 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to MDollars 219m (USDollars
83.3m) for 1992 and is stepping up its dividend, AP-DJ reports from Kuala
Lumpur.
The bank said that its performance was bolstered by strong growth in lending
and deposits. The dividend is lifted from 4.25 cents a share to 5 cents, an
increase of 18 per cent. Earnings per share rose by 25 per cent to 11.4
cents.
Development &amp; Commercial Bank, the Malaysian banking and financial services
group, reported a 34 per cent gain in pre-tax profit to MDollars 157m for
1992.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Axa
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's convertible bond from Axa suggests its investment in Equitable
Life is starting to look less of a steal. The US business was always going
to require additional capital. Even so, the market might be forgiven for
worrying that the final bill will run into hundreds of millions of dollars.
Axa is being understandably vague. It cannot itself assess the precise
impact of proposed US capital adequacy regulations or the final extent of
provisions on the investment portfolio of junk bonds and mortgages.
Having taken its US ambition thus far, though, Axa can hardly let Equitable
Life fall into disrepair. With US buyers of life assurance taking a keen
interest in financial strength, that means keeping credit ratings and
solvency well up with the pack. By injecting funds into its US operation
last year, Aegon is setting a fast pace. If others follow, Axa may end up
facing a choice between losing market share and injecting still more
capital. With its shares trading at a three-year high, Axa had a natural
opportunity to raise cash. As recession looming at home, it may not get as
good a chance again.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Reuters Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Few companies are robust enough these days to increase their capital
expenditure and dividends by a quarter and still be left with increased cash
at the year-end. But with a rating topping those of the giant drugs
companies, Reuters has to move at the speed of light.
Its fortunes depend on smoothly rolling out a stream of blockbusting
products which are both tricky and costly to develop and market. Once
successfully launched, they produce an embarrassment of riches. But that
leaves Reuters looking slightly uncomfortable with its Pounds 710m cash
pile. The more generous dividend policy is one way of disbursing the money.
A special one-off payment remains a possibility. But Reuters appears intent
on investing most of the cash in new activities. The speed and success of
this investment will largely determine whether it can retain its premium
rating.
Reuters has a host of options; the concern is that few appear to offer the
same returns as its core business. The company's interest in Visnews and ITN
highlights its ambitions in television but rewards will be slow in coming.
With the core dealing services experiencing more intense competition and
with the pipeline of new products progressing more slowly than the company
would like, Reuters may come under some short-term pressure. Like the drugs
stocks, Reuters may be heading for a rerating.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Charter Consolidated
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to fault Charter Consolidated's sale of its 38 per cent
stake in Johnson Matthey. Since the two main purchasers, Johannesburg
Consolidated and Minorco, are jointly buying 20 per cent, one might have
expected them to pay a premium for the degree of control which that
represents. But the stake is being kept within the Anglo American family and
Charter cannot complain about a historic exit multiple of nearly 20. Indeed
the failure of the move to flush out a full bidder and the relatively large
parcel which is being placed with institutions suggest Johnson Matthey is
pretty fully valued by the market.
Charter may not find it quite so easy to dispose of the proceeds. At current
interest rates, it will suffer earnings dilution while it holds the money in
cash. A reasonably quick move is thus called for. The assumption is that it
will begin by buying its own shares back from Minorco, leaving it free to
pursue its ambitions in manufacturing.
The deal will leave Charter with net cash of some Pounds 400m. That is more
than enough to buy out Minorco's 36 per cent stake, which is currently worth
some Pounds 250m. The market will then discover whether Charter's Mr Jeffrey
Herbert is as shrewd a buyer as he is a seller - no mean challenge when most
low-rated assets are cheap for a reason. He must be hoping that, after its
help with the first leg of the transaction, Minorco will set the right tone
by not driving too hard a bargain on the second.

FT  10 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling's dark side
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's producer prices were always likely to attract attention as a
first indication of the extent to which New Year price adjustments reflected
sterling's devaluation. On that basis the news is both good and bad.
Manufacturers' input prices rose 1.5 per cent over the month. Thanks to
falling unit labour costs as well as slack demand, the increase in output
prices was confined to 0.8 per cent. That is still a relatively large
increase, however, which implies a degree of inflationary pressure in the
economy. It would certainly be reasonable to expect that companies will move
quickly to rebuild their margins once demand resurfaces.
For the time being, though, the pressures are unlikely to deter the
government from cutting interest rates again. All of which makes it
perplexing that the equity market should fall by 39 points on a day when
sterling was also weak.
Recent experience suggests the prospect of weak sterling and lower interest
rates is a recipe for higher share prices. Perhaps investors felt it was
time for some profit-taking, especially since rights issue fears remain.
Perhaps the market is also watching political developments. Talk of cutting
welfare spending is a reminder that Mr Major must deliver the occasional sop
to the right as well as the left wing of the party. That could mean eventual
action to head off a protracted fall in sterling. A weak currency will cease
to be a blessing for shares the moment it becomes politically unacceptable.

Monday's Conservative Winter Ball at the Grosvenor House, the party's main

So how odd to find Lord Archer no longer running the raffle. His court

FT  10 FEB 93 / Observer: Cuccia's revenge?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps today's board meeting of La Fondiaria, Italy's second biggest
insurer, will give a clue as to how one of the country's more complex
financial puzzles is to be solved.
La Fondiaria has changed owners four times over the past decade and the
recent death of its president, Camillo De Benedetti, publicity-shy cousin of
Carlo of Olivetti fame, means that it is likely to change hands yet again.
It has the makings of a typical Italian corporate drama. Just over three
years ago Camillo bought into Fondiaria at the behest of Raul Gardini, the
then Ferruzzi boss, upsetting Enrico Cuccia, Mediobanca's legendary
deal-maker. Apparently, Cuccia had long wanted to merge Fondiaria with
Generali, Italy's biggest insurer, to create a new European giant.
Fondiaria has expanded aggressively under Camillo, notably in Germany, but
its ambitions have been severely clipped by the financial constraints of
some of its shareholders, particularly Ferruzzi. Most punters are now
betting on Fondiaria being broken up, under a Cuccia-devised plan to
strengthen Generali and lower Ferruzzi's borrowings. Fondiaria's main
operations would be sold to Generali, while its two smaller subsidiaries
would go to San Paolo, the big Turin-based bank, and a foreign insurer,
respectively. However, past experience suggests that solving Italian
financial riddles is never as simple as it seems at first sight.

Out goes Christopher Chataway as LBC chairman and in comes Dame Shirley

Although he is part of the Tesco supermarket family, Porter junior is very
much his own man. After Oxford and a stint with the Boston Consulting Group,
he struck lucky in Californian real estate, which helped finance investments
in a string of ventures ranging from credit card verification systems to a
California winery.
A former Bow Group treasurer, he shares his mother's love of Conservative

One outfit certainly not renowned for its readiness to hitch up its skirts
at the drop of a share-dealer's hat is the German steel and engineering
group, Thyssen. So what are we to make of the company's advertisement in
yesterday's Financial Times, inviting 'her shareholders' to next month's
annual meeting?
One possible explanation lies in Anglo-German (mis)understanding. Perhaps
Thyssen's copywriters, with or without the aid of the FT's ad department,
simply translated into English the feminine characteristics of the German
word 'Aktiengesellschaft'?
Then again, of course, the Iron Lady of the Ruhr could have something really
sexy in mind for March 19 in Dusseldorf.

The honeymoon threatens to be over before the wedding for London's young
Securities Institute and the Institute of Investment Management and Research
which, in essence if not name, is 36 years older.
Merger talks are due to culminate this month in plans by a joint working
party. But there were reputedly ructions at IIMR's council meeting this week
with members 'hopping mad' over the year-old SI's campaign to recruit
members.
Seeking to add 500 to its present 5,000, who're mainly former Stock Exchange
members, the Securities Institute has been beating the drum about a 'window
of opportunity' because, until March 31, experienced securities industry
practitioners can become members without passing exams.
That is seen as premarital infidelity by some of the 3,000 members of the
IIMR, exclusively exam-entry since 1979. 'They're promoting the merger as a
saleable event before it has been agreed,' sniffed one. 'It's a bit
naughty.'

FT  10 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Trade on a cliff edge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RARELY, if ever, can the principal trade negotiator of the European
Community have visited Washington at a more delicate time. For where the
Bush administration was at least shame-faced about its unilateralism in
trade policy, the Clinton administration appears bare-faced. Sir Leon
Brittan - like Mr Michio Watanabe, the Japanese foreign minister, who will
be in Washington at the same time - needs to remind the US administration of
the serious risks it runs.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US trade representative, has said that 'the days
when we could afford to subordinate our economic interests to foreign policy
or defence concerns are long past'. This credo is not even controversial in
US policy-making circles any more. It is nonsense, all the same.
The trading policies pursued by the US in the postwar era did not
subordinate US economic interests to those other objectives. On the
contrary, the postwar economic recovery of Europe and Japan greatly expanded
the opportunities facing US producers, just as it did the opportunities
enjoyed by US consumers. This Mr Kantor seems to ignore. What he seems to
mean by 'our economic interests' are the interests of particular US
industries. The cue has already been followed by the automobile industry,
with a long list of others right behind it.
What is needed, they all argue, is a 'level playing field'. Moreover, the US
has, they also assume, the right both to survey and then bulldoze its
partners' terrain. The possibility that the US playing field might not be
level either seems not to occur. Yet US anti-dumping policy, US tariff peaks
and US-imposed voluntary export restraints are just a few of the ways that
it too distorts trade.
Export volumes
The administration should consider a few facts. Despite obstacles abroad,
the volume of US exports expanded by 74 per cent between 1985 and the first
quarter of 1992, while German exports rose by 28 per cent and those of Japan
by less than 20 per cent.
Moreover, trade policy has been liberalising worldwide. The trade policies
of the EC, for example, are highly imperfect. Yet the net effect of the
single market programme - not least in the contested area of public
procurement - has been to increase opportunities for foreign companies, for
US ones not least. The EC has not been alone. Japan's trade policies have
moved steadily in a liberalising direction, while 63 countries have notified
the Gatt of unilateral trade liberalisation since the start of the Uruguay
Round.
Not since the early years of this century can US producers have faced a more
open world market. Nor can there ever have been such worldwide acceptance of
what US policy-makers have been arguing for so many decades. Yet the US
seems no longer to be particularly interested. On the fundamental question
of whether and how to complete the Uruguay Round - hardly an unexpected one,
after all - it vouchsafes no clear answer.
Dangers of conflict
The administration may believe that no great harm need be done by the
worsening of trade relations. If so, it is likely to be proved wrong. One of
the main reasons that the EC felt obliged to settle the oilseeds dispute,
despite French resistance, was the fact that it had been taken to the Gatt
twice, and lost. More broadly, trade conflict is bound to make global
economic co-operation more difficult, while failure to complete the Uruguay
round would impair fragile global confidence and worsen already weakening US
export prospects. Moreover, the administration should not assume there will
be no retaliation. President Mitterrand has already said that the EC must
respond to protectionist measures with 'protectionism and a half'.
Sir Leon must try to lift the discussion above the particular disputes
between the US and EC, even above the immediate fate of the Uruguay Round.
He needs to remind Mr Kantor what is at stake. He should show himself
accommodating where the US has a case, but firm where it does not. Above
all, he should stress that unilateralism will not remain the prerogative of
the US alone.
Ultimately, Sir Leon's interlocutor is Mr Clinton. The president needs to be
asked how far he is prepared to risk what his predecessors achieved over
half a century. The world waits for his answer.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Descent from riches to rags: The dire state of the UK's
public finances is forcing the government to consider radical remedies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The figures are daunting. In the coming financial year, the British
government will have to borrow about Pounds 1,000 for every man, woman and
child in the country, tapping financial markets for funds at a rate of
Pounds 1bn a week.
The outlook, if the City of London is to be believed, is even more alarming.
In five years, the pessimists say, the government could be borrowing more
than 10 per cent of UK gross domestic product a year to plug holes in the
public accounts, while the nation's debt to GDP ratio could be 70 per cent
and rising.
The dire state of Britain's public finances is all the more apparent when
measured against the recent past. Three years ago, the public sector ran a
large surplus, enabling the government to reduce the national debt. Today,
the talk is of cruel choices between tax increases or welfare cuts and of a
fiscal rake's progress into a structural budget crisis of Italian
proportions.
Although prospects for recovery are likely to be uppermost in Mr Norman
Lamont's mind as the chancellor prepares his March 16 Budget, the
government's announcement this week of an exhaustive review of public
spending priorities over the rest of this decade is symptomatic of deep
concern about the nation's finances.
The official line is that the present problem is cyclical, reflecting the
fall in tax revenues arising from the recession and rising costs, such as
unemployment pay and other social security outlays such as income support.
But serious commentators such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development in Paris and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, as well as
City securities houses, including Goldman Sachs and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
argue that part of the deficit is now structural. It will not be
self-correcting if and when the economy returns to normal growth.
Whatever the diagnosis, the chancellor cannot ignore the sudden shift from a
Pounds 14.7bn public sector surplus in 1988-89 to a deficit of Pounds 25.7bn
in the first nine months of the present financial year alone. The shortfalls
in prospect threaten to make a mockery of the government's election
manifesto promises such as making further cuts in personal tax rates.
Financing the deficits could put a question mark over recovery from
recession.
But how has Britain got into this mess - if indeed it is a mess? And what
does the decline into deficit of the past five years tell us about the
outlook for public spending, taxation and correcting the deficit?
There would be no deficit problem without the recession. But the recession
cannot fully explain the deterioration. Social change, tax reform, political
mistakes and electoral politics over the past 14 years have left their mark
on tax revenues and public spending, and helped create Britain's deficits.
Last November's Autumn Statement gave an important clue as to how the
recession affects government finances. It revised upwards the public sector
borrowing requirement forecast for the 1992-93 financial year to Pounds 37bn
from the Pounds 28bn predicted at the time of the 1992 Budget. The Pounds
9bn worsening in the deficit was primarily due to a Pounds 6.7bn drop in
anticipated tax receipts while spending this year was estimated to be Pounds
2.3bn higher than previously forecast.
The sensitivity of tax revenues to economic slowdown is not a new
phenomenon. Indeed, a drop in the tax burden in recession is an important
aspect of the 'automatic stabiliser' mechanism in a modern mixed economy,
which helps smooth the business cycle and revive growth.
But the tax reforms of the 1980s - and in particular the corporation tax
changes initiated in the then Mr Nigel Lawson's Budget of 1984 - appear to
have increased the responsiveness of revenues to changes in the cycle.
The government benefited from this in the period of strong growth in the
1980s, when the increase in corporation tax receipts contributed about
one-third to the swing in public finances from deficit to surplus between
1984-85 and 1988-89. Revenues from corporation tax receipts grew at an
average rate of 25 per cent a year in the five years after 1984-85 and were
worth more than 4 per cent of GDP, or Pounds 21.5bn, at their peak in
1989-90.
But the recession has produced an equally sharp contraction in corporation
tax revenues. They fell to Pounds 18.26bn in 1991-92 and so far in this
financial year have declined by 18.3 per cent to Pounds 9.97bn from Pounds
12.2bn in the same 1991-92 period.
The worry for the future is that corporation tax revenues may not rebound
once the recession is over. Their buoyancy in the 1980s partly reflected
special circumstances, not least the unusual length of the upswing. Mr
Lamont has since cut corporation tax rates below the levels bequeathed by Mr
Lawson while companies have a large recession-generated overhang of losses
to set against tax.
The government's in-depth probe of the annual Pounds 260bn of public
spending is a clear admission that something has gone badly wrong on that
side of the budget. The departments selected by Mr Michael Portillo, the
chief secretary to the Treasury, for initial scrutiny - social security,
health, education and the Home Office - show where the government suspects
structural problems are rife.
When Mrs Margaret Thatcher took office in 1979, she was determined to reduce
the role of the state in society and cut public spending. In the mid-1980s,
the government's public spending objective was modified to 'take a declining
share of the national income over time while value for money is constantly
improved'.
Yet Treasury estimates suggest that general government expenditure (that is,
spending by central government and local authorities) less privatisation
proceeds in the current financial year ending on March 31 will amount to
44.75 per cent of GDP - more than the 44 per cent share of 1979-80.
The recession and the rise in unemployment to nearly 3m from 1.6m in April
1990 partly explain this disappointing trend. According to the latest
estimates, each 100,000 rise in unemployment adds about Pounds 345m to the
annual social security budget, with Pounds 45m going on unemployment benefit
and Pounds 300m on income support, housing benefit and community charge
benefit. The fact that this recession has hit the middle classes in the
formerly affluent areas of the south-east has added to the government's
costs. At the last count, some 411,000 income support recipients were
receiving help with mortgage interest payments at an annual cost of Pounds
949m.
But spending on social security will be 65 per cent more in real terms in
1992-93 than in 1978-79 and only 25 percentage points of this increase can
be explained by the current recession.
Between 1978-79 and the current financial year, social security payments
have increased as a share of GDP to 13.2 per cent from 10 per cent. Social
security expenditure has nearly doubled in nominal terms since 1984-85, when
it was Pounds 40bn, to an estimated Pounds 79.2bn in the current financial
year.
Government figures show that, in real terms, the level of social security
spending was higher at the end of the 1980s than after the 1979-81 recession
in spite of nine years of growth. The increase in outlays in the current
recession has been far sharper than in previous one.
These trends reflect changes in society as well as rising unemployment. The
number of people over the age of 75 has risen by 22 per cent since 1981;
there are more single parents; more of the social security budget has to be
spent on the long-term sick and disabled. There is no quick fix to resolving
cost increases of this sort.
Other changes in public spending have reflected deliberate political choices
in response to the perceived needs of society or the wishes of the
electorate. Annual spending on housing fell in real terms by 52.4 per cent
between 1978-79 and 1992-93. In the same period, the public sector's annual
expenditure on trade, industry and energy fell a real 37.5 per cent as a
result of privatisation and the elimination of subsidies for ailing
industries.
On the other hand, the government's annual National Health Service budget
has risen by 56 per cent in real terms since 1978-79 and is expected to
account for 5.8 per cent of GDP in 1992-93, against 4.6 per cent 14 years
ago. Law and order, transport and education have all required more funding,
with annual outlays rising in real terms by 96 per cent, 28 per cent and 26
per cent compared with 1978-79.
But the UK would be better able to afford such burdens if the past 10 years
had not been punctuated by expensive political banana-skins and the prime
minister and Mr Lamont had not greatly relaxed their grip over expenditure
and taxation ahead of the 1992 general election.
Of the political mishaps, the poll tax debacle was the most damaging and
costly. The scale of the damage is clear in government figures for the 'new
control total', a new spending measure introduced last summer that
eliminates most cyclical spending. This jumped in real terms by 5.3 per cent
in 1989-90. More than half of this increase (2.45 per cent) reflected a
sharp jump in local authority self-financed expenditure as councils rushed
to push up spending by a real 35.4 per cent to Pounds 15.6bn ahead of the
introduction of the new tax. They acted in the knowledge that they could
blame any consequences for taxation on central government: a gamble that
paid off in 1991, when Mr Lamont increased value added tax to 17.5 per cent
from 15 per cent to pay for a reduction in individual poll tax payments.
Government spending on services such as health, education and the police has
also risen substantially in response to changed priorities since Mr John
Major became prime minister in November 1990.
Overall spending on services grew in real terms by 4.16 per cent between
1990-91 and 1991-92, while growth between 1991-92 and 1992-93 has been
budgeted at a real 5.97 per cent. Sharp increases in the control total have
been budgeted for the current financial year, reflecting the increased
spending on services announced before the election.
The OECD, in its latest survey of the UK economy, estimates that roughly 30
per cent of the deterioration in the budget balance since 1990 has been due
to structural rather than cyclical factors. It calculates that the
cyclically adjusted budget deficit increased by about 1.5 per cent of GDP
between 1990 and 1992, because of higher spending and reduced revenues. Much
of this addition to the structural budget deficit reflected changes
announced in the pre-election Autumn Statement of 1991 and Budgets of 1991
and March last year.
But what of the future? Here the pundits differ. The OECD thinks the
government should increase tax revenues by up to Pounds 10bn to steady the
deficit. Goldman Sachs and the IFS see a need to close the annual gap
between revenue and expenditure over the medium term by about Pounds 20bn.
Looking ahead, Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist at Goldman Sachs and one
of the seven-man panel of forecasters appointed to advise Mr Lamont, says
that the public sector borrowing requirement in 1993-94 is likely to be
about Pounds 54bn or 8.75 per cent of GDP. On a central, and possibly
optimistic, assumption of 3 per cent growth from 1993-94 onwards, he says
that the deficit is likely to stay at more than Pounds 50bn a year until
1997-98.
Mr Bill Martin, chief economist of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, has simulated
Treasury growth, expenditure and revenue projections to conclude that the
PSBR could still be 2.75 per cent of GDP in the 1997-98 financial year,
lifting Britain's stock of debt to some 50 per cent of annual national
output compared with about a third at present.
He warns that a more pessimistic scenario, which assumes lower growth and
rising public spending in line with electoral demands, would produce a
deficit of about Pounds 80bn in 1997-98. This would be equivalent to 10.25
per cent of GDP and result in a public debt to GDP ratio of 70 per cent that
would still be rising at that stage.
However, some experts, such as Mr Chris Trinder, research director of the
Public Finance Foundation in London, warn against panic reactions to such
deficit forecasts. The PSBR is the difference between two big numbers, and
forecasts have been notoriously wrong in the past, Mr Trinder points out. Mr
Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research and another of Mr Lamont's seven advisers, is also fairly sanguine.
He says that some of the discretionary loosening of policy in recent years
has been good for the economy, while the Maastricht treaty provides for
deficits of up to 3 per cent of GDP.
Until recently it seemed that the Treasury might be coming to terms with the
deficits. In evidence to the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service
Committee last autumn, Mr Lamont cast some doubt on the Treasury's stated
goal of balancing the budget over the economic cycle. While asserting that
this was still the government's objective, he added: 'That has never ever
meant taking the sum of the borrowing over the years and saying that it
should sum to zero.'
However, Mr Portillo's investigation of public expenditure points the other
way. It is a reaffirmation of the government's determination to reduce
public spending as a share of national income and leave wealth creation to
the private sector.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Rethinking British defence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MALCOLM Rifkind, the British defence secretary, sought to pre-empt
yesterday's report from the House of Commons select committee by rescinding
some planned cuts in the country's armed forces - at a cost of 'only' Pounds
80m or one-third of 1 per cent of the defence budget. On Monday Mr Michael
Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, announced a sweeping review
of public expenditure in general, but appeared to exempt defence as a
principal target. Yesterday the select committee duly reported, seeking even
more concessions than Mr Rifkind had already offered.
It may be concluded from these events that Britain is still far from a
political consensus about the scale of its defence spending in a
post-imperial world. The question that has haunted the debate for decades
continues to hover. Is there a case for economically battered Britain to
outspend its richer European neighbours, devoting 4 per cent of its economic
output to defence, compared with 3.4 per cent for France and only 2.2 per
cent for Germany?
There are many signs that old lessons have not been learnt. In 1990 the
statement Options for Change by the then defence secretary, Mr Tom King,
suggested substantial reductions in force levels as a result of the end of
the cold war, though even then the cuts in costs did not match the proposed
cuts in manpower. With these cuts still not fully implemented, there is
already talk of overstretch, which is merely the current term for describing
the old problem of too few resources to match too many commitments. The
select committee calls the overstretch 'chronic' and wants all planned cuts
in ground forces to be stopped.
Top tables
The motives behind such thinking too often stem from a nostalgia for a
country that was more powerful and relatively richer than it is today. More
insidiously, attempts to keep up with defence spending spring from a desire
to impress the Americans and to maintain a place at top tables. Almost
invariably, however, the dilemma returns: Britain tries to do too much and,
in the context of the latest public spending crisis, has to cut back.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has done something to develop the
context for an alternative view. In a recent speech at Chatham House, he
noted the trend towards international military intervention, whether of the
peacekeeping or peacemaking variety, and envisaged for Britain a worthy
rather than a leading role. His theme was that Britain cannot do everything
towards which it feels morally or politically impelled.
Burden-sharing
Mr Hurd's analysis, however, stopped short of suggesting solutions. If
Britain is to do less, who is to do more? In Europe, Germany? In Asia,
Japan? If there is to be more burden-sharing, by what process is that burden
to be shared: by ad hoc contributions of the kind which financed the war
against Saddam Hussein, or via the United Nations, which is already
bedevilled by the failures of some members to pay their dues?
Nor is this a complete list of the awkward questions which lie ahead. If
Britain is to cede more international defence activity to others, how long
can it maintain its position as a permanent member of the UN Security
Council? If it is seriously to consider relinquishing that seat, what price
could it or should it seek in return? And within the European Community, how
can a potential British desire for more burden-sharing be made to fit with
its anxiety about more integrated EC defence structures?
As the world seeks answers to these complex questions, Britain has much to
offer. Its armed forces have a deserved reputation for professionalism. Its
relationship with the sole superpower, the US, is special. Britain can do
much to help modernise Nato, develop the Western European Union and cement
bilateral links with France. It can also play a worthy part in international
peacekeeping.
But it cannot evade larger questions about the resources of its own economy
or shifts in relative global economic and political standing. Mr Rifkind's
concessions will comfort those who prefer old glories to harsher truths.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Letter: Hoover relocation as part of larger trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Messrs SEAN SHEPLEY and JONATHAN WILMOT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Are Europe's politicians ready for the single market? Perhaps not if
the reaction to the announcement of Hoover's plans to shift production of
vacuum cleaners from Dijon to Glasgow is anything to go by. This case has
nothing to do with social dumping and everything to do with the single
market's basic goal - increased productivity and higher living standards for
workers.
A particular result of the single market is that production becomes more
concentrated and much more specialised by region. That Hoover's announcement
came just days before Nestle's decision to move from Glasgow to Newcastle
and Dijon was a neat example of the way in which different industries are
attracted to different regions. In the US, this process of regional
specialisation is far more advanced, suggesting Europe still has a long way
to go.
Indeed, the Hoover and Nestle examples are part of a tidal wave of
relocation sweeping across Europe. Many more plants will have to close and
possibly even whole industries may have to relocate before we see the most
efficient production structure in Europe. In this restructuring process,
those regions with best access to Europe's core markets will find it easier
to attract production and jobs. Peripheral regions will have to work harder
to create an attractive regional base for inward investment.
One point is clear: by harmonising social conditions, the location advantage
of the core regions would be boosted enormously. Although flexibility in
labour and product markets is important for all regions, it is absolutely
essential for the lagging regions on Europe's periphery. Anything else will
be a recipe for mass unemployment, followed by migration to the prosperous
core. For us, this is the real 'social dumping' that the Community should be
worried about.
We go into these issues in greater deal in our recent paper, Europe: Core vs
Periphery. The response we received from the Dutch authorities appears to us
to be far preferable to that seen so far in France.
'The development towards increasing specialisation per region and the
substantial importance of clusters of companies therein, already plays an
important role in Dutch policy. The policy of (the Ministry of) Economic
Affairs constantly stresses the importance of technology, infrastructure and
a well-educated workforce to attract clusters of companies.'

FT  10 FEB 93 / Letter: VAT plan would hit food industry and the poorest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL MACKENZIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, So Lex (February 3) believes that imposing standard-rate VAT on all
food will have little consequence for consumers, employment or the food
industry] This conclusion verges on the glib, in assuming that the British
economy and the food industry have infinite capacity to absorb inflationary
pressures.
During a period of recession the UK food industry could not confront such an
economic shock with equanimity. To absorb price increases it would have to
cut back further on investment and pare overheads and operating costs even
closer to the bone. Lex has also ignored the 18 per cent increase in key raw
material prices imposed on food and drink processors by the devaluation of
the green pound since last September. This compounds the problem of
remaining competitive with overseas suppliers and any additional price
pressures could well sell UK jobs abroad.
Imposing standard-rate VAT on food will hit the poorest sections of society
hardest. How can those who already buy the lowest-priced food trade down
even further, as Lex suggests? The article recognises the 'knock-on' effects
of reduced consumer expenditure in other sectors but fails to specify that
this means deeper recession still and yet more unemployment. These
consequences have to be confronted squarely.
Food is essential to life and no food should be taxed, on principle.

FT  10 FEB 93 / A charge that's set to shock: Most UK bank customers may
soon have to pay fees on their personal accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Theresa Bergne went into her bank last week to express her annoyance at
the charges it makes if she goes into overdraft. The prospect of being
charged even if she stays in credit is worse. 'I would be absolutely
furious. They have my money, and they earn interest on it. I shouldn't have
to pay for every little piece of administration,' she says.
The high street banks are hardly popular at the moment, partly because of
criticism of lending policies to small business. But an end to 'free'
banking for personal customers threatens a nadir in their reputation. 'I
think they are going to be in the firing line,' says Mr Alistair Darling,
the Labour party's City of London spokesman, 'They will expose themselves to
the accusation of extracting money to pay for their past mistakes.'
Fears of criticism have delayed charges. But they may not be far off. The
first move was made last week by Save &amp; Prosper, the small bank owned by
Robert Fleming. It said that from April it would charge 15,000 holders of
its Classic current account if their balance falls below Pounds 1,000.
It now appears only a matter of time before big banks start imposing charges
on a large proportion of their 49m personal accounts. The banks all publicly
insist that they have no plans to start charging. But privately, several
fear a rival might break ranks during the season of full-year results
announcements, which starts on Friday with Lloyds.
Pressure has been raised by the fall in base rates to 6 per cent. This has
undermined the shaky economics of free banking by cutting the amount that
banks earn from balances in current accounts. The returns on both money
market and corporate lending have fallen along with base rates. One bank
estimates that it now loses money on 80 per cent of its current accounts.
The same bank argues that it would be impossible to hold back on charging if
base rates fall much further. Banks now estimate that they need an average
balance of between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 1,500 in each account to generate
enough interest income to pay for the annual cost of Pounds 60 to Pounds 90
of running each account.
The timing of a move to impose charges is a delicate calculation. If one
bank acted, the others would be likely to follow. This is because the first
might otherwise shift its least profitable customers to the others. One
banker estimates that there are 1m customers whose business no bank really
wants without charges because their balances are too low.
Yet while they would probably follow a leader, most banks are reluctant to
lead themselves. This is partly because of fear of public criticism. But it
is also because each bank says it needs time to calculate a pricing
strategy. By just introducing a blanket charge, the first bank to charge
risks repelling its good customers along with its bad ones.
While they ponder this problem, banks have raised charges for personal
customers who slip into overdraft. In effect, they are now overcharging them
to pay for unprofitable accounts kept in small surplus. 'There is a strong
argument that those who borrow money are now subsidising those who play
carefully by the rules,' says one bank chief executive.
Free banking for customers in credit among the big banks was started by
Midland in 1984 in response to the challenge from building societies which
started to offer cheque-clearing accounts. The other high street banks
followed in 1985. The cost of offering customers clearing services free was
not such a strain because base rates were around 13 per cent.
But the innovation had two damaging effects for banks. The first was that
the banks encouraged the public perception that they did not provide a
worthwhile service. 'We have given banking away free, so people have not
regarded it as a commodity,' says a bank chief executive. 'We have made
ourselves the only developed nation in the world which does not require
payment for core banking.'
The second damaging effect of free banking was that it raised the costs of
administering accounts by fragmenting the customer base. Because accounts
were free, more people opened two. The number of personal accounts at banks,
which rose only slightly from 24.5m to 26m between 1981 and 1984, started
growing rapidly to today's 49m.
Not only did fewer accounts become profitable as average balances fell, but
the costs of processing cheques and card transactions rose. The banks'
Association for Payment and Clearing Services has just estimated that it now
costs the banks a total of Pounds 4.5bn a year to run the clearing system,
about half of which is the cost of distributing cash.
Mr Ian Lindsey, banking director of Save &amp; Prosper, admits that it started
charging partly because it feared the average balance in its Classic account
would be cut from the current Pounds 5,000. 'We were already getting
accounts that we did not want under the old tariff, and we feared the
trickle would become a flood if another bank started charging,' he says.
Banks are considering four main strategies which could stop their most
profitable personal customers leaving if charges are reintroduced:
Not charging customers who retain high balances: this is likely for
customers with balances above Pounds 1,500 because the interest earned on
their balances is greater than the cost of operating their accounts. The
fine calculation is in deciding which other customers should get free
services. Mr Lindsey believes the high street banks may set the limit as low
as Pounds 500 in order to keep customers whose overall business is valuable.
Offering different amounts of service for different levels of fee: an
obvious example would be to offer 24-hour telephone banking only to those
who pay extra. But it is hard to segment existing services because they are
offered through branches which are open to all customers. Giving new forms
of service in return for fees will only add to overall costs.
Linking 'free' banking to the total value of a customers' business with the
bank: this would be a logical strategy to encourage sales of products such
as mortgages, loans and insurance. The question is whether banks will be
able to preserve their claim to offer independent advice if such incentives
are introduced.
Maintaining 'free' banking for young customers. Youth accounts lose money
because they usually have low balances. But the loss is worth incurring if
it establishes loyalty from a customer who becomes more profitable with age.
Young people with earnings potential such as students may continue not to be
charged, or may be charged less.
Because banks are likely to choose different combinations of these
strategies, the effect on the industry is uncertain. Banks might persuade
customers to close second accounts to maintain higher balances in their
primary one. But they will be vulnerable to lower-cost competitors such as
building societies or telephone banks which can retain 'free' banking
longer.
Banks look hopefully at the experience of the Barclaycard credit card
subsidiary of Barclays when it introduced an annual fee in 1990. It lost
485,000 active accounts and a further 1m dormant ones from a total of 10m
within a year. But the number of transactions remained virtually the same,
as the same business was conducted on fewer cards.
Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclaycard, says the introduction
of charges was not too damaging because it was carefully planned. By
offering new services at the same time as it introduced a fee, Barclaycard
created a sense that it was worth paying for.
That is the best the banks can expect. The worst is that there will be a
flight of the customers to whom they were hoping to sell more products. When
the move finally comes, a lot will turn on the reaction of Ms Bergne and the
rest of the growing band of dissatisfied bank customers.

<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Teddy Taylor, in quoting that 'strange singer' Bob Marley at the
Young Conservatives conference, was in fact misplacing the credit for the
line he chose (''Yobs' blow loud Euro-raspberry at Major', February 8).
'Stand up for your rights' in this context comes from the song 'Get Up,
Stand Up', written by Marley's friend Peter Tosh who was murdered in Jamaica
in 1987.
I would draw Sir Teddy's attention to the very fine solo works of Mr Tosh,
which for many articulated the messages of Rastafarianism and anti-racism
more potently and coherently even than Marley himself.

   From Ms CHRISTINE A CATON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Heseltine was reported as saying that the UK has got the balance
wrong in the creation of wealth ('Heseltine laments oversupply of
accountants', February 6). He inferred that accountants and lawyers are too
many in number and not crucial in financial strategy. In response to
Heseltine (part qualified) a representative from the Institute of Chartered
Accountants apparently spoke wearily and guardedly and the FT remarked in
passing that the institute reports to the DTI on regulatory matters]
As a chartered accountant in practice, weary and worn with regulation and
compliance, sick of the recession, the grumbling and the resistance of
clients to professional fees, I am not surprised that the standing of a
chartered accountant has become denigrated. May I suggest some reasons for
this unpalatable situation.
(a) Some 30-40 per cent of my practice time is spent on compliance,
regulation and form filling exercises for the government. I cannot therefore
develop my expertise to the full or maximise my contribution and experience
to the businesses of my clients.
(b) I cannot offer a full and embracing professional service to client
companies because I have to demonstrate to the Joint Monitoring Unit that as
audit compliance partner I have carried out an audit, as wide in scope for a
large public company, for small proprietorial companies. The scope of the
work has become greater with additional man hours.
(c) I can only employ the levels and calibre of staff, as dictated by my
professional body, and the costs of practice administration and training
have increased significantly.
I have two sons aged 17 and 21 and I am thinking very seriously as to
whether their futures would be better without professional qualification. Mr
Heseltine's comments and the rather spineless reaction from the Institute of
Chartered Accountants certainly add substance to this view.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Ready, willing but still unable: A proposal to give Germany
a role as peacekeeper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There should be German troops in Northern Ireland. It might not solve the
Northern Irish problem, but it could well be the solution to the German
problem.
Some readers may be surprised to hear that there is still a German problem.
Others may suppose that today's German problem is an economic one. But if
you had been at the annual Munich Conference on Security Policy last
weekend, you would know that the new German question is about German troops
serving outside the Nato area. It falls into several parts:
Where can the troops go?
What can they do when they get there?
What colour helmets should they wear?
Is a constitutional amendment required?
Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants to be free to send German troops anywhere, and
for any purpose - 'peacekeeping, peacemaking and peace-enforcing' - required
by the United Nations. He does not think an amendment is needed, but has
agreed to seek one, in deference to his Free Democratic party coalition
partners.
The trouble is, he cannot muster the requisite majority without the support
of the Social Democratic (SPD) opposition. The SPD, for its part, thinks the
Bundeswehr should be available to the UN only for 'blue helmet missions' - a
phrase generally understood in Germany to refer to traditional UN
peacekeepers, who can use force only in their own defence. The SPD
parliamentary leader, Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, said his party had accepted 'the
now very much wider spectrum of such operations . . . including the
monitoring of embargoes, underpinning humanitarian operations, setting up
protective zones and the preventive stationing of blue helmets, that is,
approximately 90 per cent of all the missions that have occurred so far'.
Mr Klose added that he himself 'would be in favour of having the Bundeswehr
participate in all such missions of the UN or regional organisations under
its mandate, even where - to accomplish the set goal - force had to be used
as well'. He would take exception only to missions 'whose goal is the use of
force'.
Since it is hard to imagine the goal of any mission being defined as the use
of force for the heck of it, this formulation took Mr Klose within spitting
distance of the chancellor's position.
It caused a ripple of excitement, but only a ripple, since it appears Mr
Klose has no chance of carrying his party with him; and even he said he
would be stricter than the government in insisting on a 'definite link with
a specific and lasting UN mandate'.
Everyone in Germany seems to agree that the use of force, other than in
direct defence of yourself or your allies, has to be somehow legitimised by
the UN. Only non-official English-speaking visitors at the conference were
so ungracious as to point out that this means making any military action by
western countries, whether to rescue people from genocide or to prevent a
local war from spreading, dependent on the whim of the Chinese and Russian
governments.
Not only Germans but Europeans in general seem to agree that German troops
cannot be used at present in the former Yugoslavia. It was therefore
discouraging, for those who see American troops as an essential ingredient
of any serious effort to end the war in Bosnia, to hear a prominent
Republican senator, Mr William Cohen, say that Congress was unlikely to
sanction direct US military involvement unless there was German
participation 'not just in Awacs (surveillance aircraft) but behind
artillery pieces and perhaps in tanks'.
As things stand, even the German crew members on the Nato Awacs aircraft now
monitoring the no-fly zone in Bosnia will have to be withdrawn if and when
the Security Council authorises military action to enforce it.
Europeans have come to accept Germany's inability to join any military
action in the former Yugoslavia as a fact of life, not least because they
know the arrival of German troops would be exploited in Serbian official
propaganda. But many speakers did question Mr Kohl's rationale for not
joining when he said 'there are places in Europe where it is out of the
question for German divisions to be sent, because there are people still
alive who have a very concrete experience' of the second world war 'and all
the horrors connected with it'.
Americans especially, but some Germans too, said it was quite wrong to
equate today's democratic Germany with yesterday's Nazi Germany, or the
Bundeswehr with the Wehrmacht. On the contrary, Germany's past war crimes
gave it all the greater obligation to involve itself in efforts, including
military efforts, to preserve the peace in Europe now.
If the chancellor's argument were to be accepted, said Mr Josef Joffe,
foreign editor of the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the German newspaper, the only
place in Europe where German troops could be deployed would be Sweden.
Perhaps he is right, but I think Northern Ireland might be prepared to put
up with them, in spite of its memories of German bombing. It is clearly
inside the Nato area, and with a bit of effort Germany could field units
comprising equal numbers of Catholics and Protestants.
And then 12 British battalions based in Northern Ireland, with plenty of
'peacekeeping' experience and no constitutional inhibitions about serving
anywhere, would be free to do their bit for the new world order.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The star of Harold Pinter's No Man's Land, which has moved from the Almeida
in Islington to the Comedy Theatre in the West End, is not so much Pinter
the writer as Pinter the actor. Pinter plays Hirst, the part originally
taken by Ralph Richardson in the National Theatre production in 1975. In the
second act he shows one of the most commanding stage presences I have seen,
often by not speaking. Paul Eddington plays the other sexagenarian, Spooner,
following John Gielgud in the original. The influence of TS Eliot is
pervasive and presumably deliberate. This is Pinter as the author must wish
it to be done. It is often vacuous, but it is sensational to watch.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Arts: Solti and the Vienna Philharmonic - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Vienna Philharmonic is giving three London concerts during the current
season, part of its 'European series' shared with Paris and Berlin. James
Levine conducted the first programme in November and Riccardo Muti will take
charge of the last in May; Georg Solti appeared with the orchestra on Monday
for a programme of Mendelssohn (the Fourth Symphony) and Shostakovich (the
Fifth).
The combination of Solti and an orchestra still able to trade on its
illustrious pedigree ensured a full, rapturous house. It was, though, an
occasion to inspire only modified rapture; artists and repertory had been
mismatched in a strangely perverse way. Applying Solti's angular
propulsiveness to a Mendelssohn symphony is the musical equivalent of
breaking a butterfly on a wheel, while the VPO's greatest admirers would not
dare to claim that it plays Shostakovich with the same distinctive flair and
style it brings to the Viennese classics or to Strauss.
Yet a genuinely great orchestra, which the Vienna patently still aspires to
be, really should have the potential to adapt its approach rather than
construe everything within its own terms of reference. It did so brilliantly
at the Proms last August when playing for Boulez, but seemed to be operating
strictly on autopilot for the Shostakovich here.
Solti, who appears to be working systematically through the canon, was
strangely restrained in the
Fifth too. One expected this conductor and these strings to
make something more of the opening paragraphs and to invest the heart of the
slow movement with sensuous depth, but no. Even the finale, launched at a
frantic pace, ran
out of steam well before the
close. It was pallid, routine, uninteresting.
Only an encore of the Fledermaus overture, whipped and driven in the Solti
way with a sort of tight-lipped humour, showed any character; by then it was
too late.

<TEXT>
In the wrong part of Sarajevo, the washing-up can cost you your life.
Panorama's Forcing a Peace (BBC 1, Monday) began with reporter Martin Bell
and his crew filming people who daily run the gauntlet to fetch water from a
tap in a cellar, the only running water left in their neighbourhood. Each
day, Serb snipers pick off their toll of victims. We saw a young man shot in
the thigh, saw the fresh wound, and his puzzled expression suddenly wiped
away by the white-faced immobility of shock. Bell's interpreter, a doctor,
staunched the wound and the BBC jeep did duty as an ambulance.
This was a notable feat of reporting and deeply harrowing. Bell's team
filmed the fighting in the front-line of the battle, from trenches cut
through Sarajevo's Olympic Village. Killing and the daily struggle to live
are closely intertwined. As trees in the parks are hacked down for firewood,
the snipers' aim gets ever more accurate. The parks, and now a football
pitch, have been taken over for cemeteries. A bread-queue makes an easy
target.
Over the months, film-clips on the news broadcasts have tended to become
cliches which actually make it harder to register what life can actually be
like in Sarajevo. Time and again, we have seen puffs of white smoke drifting
over what still seems like a picture-postcard prospect of tiled roofs,
tawny-coloured churches and minarets. Film of UN military vehicles on the
road to the airport can become an image of normality. Last night's images
gave the lie to that when we saw UN vehicles speed past a young woman lying
by the roadside in a pool of blood.
It takes time to bring home the savagery of the war in Bosnia. Monday
night's Panorama seemed like a very long 40 minutes. A Moslem woman spoke of
months of captivity with 12 other women, and of being subjected to rape
once, twice, or more at night. She spoke, too, of a six year-old girl held
with them. A UN worker described in detail the manner in which amputations
had been carried out in one hospital in a besieged Moslem town. Children
endure that, too, and the wonder is that some of them even survive.
Bell's point was a simple one; that the ordinary Bosnians' suffering has
been so great that the outside world must now intervene to force a peace.
Rightly, he did not get into discussion of precisely how that might happen,
and what it might cost in non-Bosnian lives.
His aim was an unsparing and, in the end, even-handed presentation of the
ghastliness of this war. In a Bosnian Serb village, 23 were massacred,
either shot or their throats cut in cold blood. Their corpses lay in a room
awaiting burial, white and stiff as tailors' dummies.
For some reason, in the UK the Bosnian tragedy has failed to trigger that
mysterious thing, a public sense of pity and outrage. The trivialisation of
TV news can hardly have helped. Last year's revamp of ITV's News at Ten has
left it with a glib format which on some nights teeters on the edge of
inanity. Serious current affairs documentaries of the calibre of Panorama
are more to be prized than ever.
Until this week, I had a false image of what going down the Nile on a
pleasure-boat entails. My mental picture was of people on deck-chairs
beneath an awning, looking with rapt interest at the immemorial landscape of
palms, peasants, and water-buffalo. But apparently it is not like that at
all, accord-ing to BBC2's Assignment report on Egypt, The Gun and the Veil
(Tuesday).
These days, people go down the Nile lying side by side, nearly naked and
sweating oil rather in the manner of sardines on toast. It seems not so hard
to sympathise with the views of Omar Abdul Rahman, leader of the Islamic
League. The sheikh is a venerable, blind, holy man who lives in voluntary
exile in New York after being tried, but acquitted, on the charge of
ordering President Sadat's assassination. He inveighs against tourists as
the work of the devil, polluting the land with gambling, adultery,
prostitution, Aids, etc.
Unfortunately, the sheikh's words did not make clear whether he will
tolerate on Egyptian soil the kind of discreet, respectably dressed tourist
who wears ankle-length skirts and a head-scarf. Since followers of the
Islamic League have murdered a small number of tourists, one would have
appreciated a directive from the sheikh.
At any rate, substantial damage has been done to the tourist trade,
allegedly down some 30 to 50 per cent this year, causing the Egyptian
government to lose millions of dollars in revenue.
And yet, there is far more to the rising tide of religious orthodoxy in
Egypt than highly-publicised violence against westerners. In a poor (albeit
by no means the poorest) district of Cairo, the kind of area where tourists
never penetrate, the blocks of flats look onto lakes of sewage. In such
districts, the Moslem Brotherhood runs cheap yet effective clinics where
doctors and nurses show themselves to be kind, compassionate, honest - in a
word, to be good Moslems. This sane and sympathetically made documentary
showed that it is qualities like these which may be the keenest weapon in
the armoury of so-called Islamic fundamentalism.
Femme Fatale by Simon Gray, in the current season of Screen 2 (BBC2,
Sunday), was a black comedy about how the random relations between good
intentions and evil consequences. Not vintage Gray, perhaps, but an
enjoyable play all the same. Its problem lay with a dangerously slow
opening. Of course the ironic undertow was there, only it seemed to be
flowing a mite too sluggishly to compensate for the setting, twee flummery
in a Somerset village. For a while it seemed that this was merely an EC
version of Cold Comfort Farm, with a diminutive, hot-blooded Italian virgin
(Sophia Diaz) brought in as agent provocateuse.
Things did pick up speed once the characters developed a bit and once the
cloven hoof of Vicar Ronnie became clearer, played by Simon Callow.
Garage-owner Algie (James Fleet), made a splendidly evil Scots seducer who
never got his girl. Without being hilarious, there was plenty to smile at.
It made a nice touch to have the corpulent shopkeeper (Colin Welland) almost
as enamoured of his Italian daughter-in-law's pasta, pronounced as in meat
pasty, as her voluptuous body.
Last week's Essential History of Europe (BBC 2, 9.00), will surely have left
Luxemburgers feeling put out, and with good reason. The opening proposition
was that 'more Luxemburgers commit suicide each year than are killed on the
road'. Which fact is, of course, wholly meaningless unless we are also told
about the country's road safety record.
Instead, we were left to deduce unfavourable conclusions about the lives of
the poor rich folk of that tiny nation. Later, there was sinister mention of
a bridge from which suicides throw themselves, an effective and
time-honoured method of doing yourself in which is also popular in London,
Bristol, and Paris. What really is the evidence that Luxemburgers are the
lemmings of the EC?
As far as I know, every country in the EC has a drugs problem so it seemed
gratuitous to fasten on the drugs scene in Luxemburg. Furthermore, it is
plain silly to claim anything paradoxical in a country where jobs are
plentiful and living-standards are notably high, having the same proportion
of drug addicts as in 'other major capitals'.
From the stand-point of this oddly prejudiced, often self-contradictory
analysis, Luxemburg was in a no-win position. The strangest things were
marked to the debit side of the slate; that there is only one prison, and
that one third of its inmates are there for drug-related crimes. Again,
without statistics this is meaningless. Maybe there is a super-efficient
gendarmerie, or maybe there are only thirty criminals in jug.
The children of the country's large influx of Portuguese workers 'are
becoming Luxemburgers' - the innuendo being this this is per se a bad thing.
In the last war, the 'German occupation focused Luxemburg's frail sense of
nationality'. Why should it be judged frail, given that previous speakers
had stressed the cohesiveness of this fortress state, its inhabitants bound
by their 'secret language' and their passion for clubs. It will be
inter-esting to see what next's week's concluding film in this provocative
series makes of Belgium's wartime experience.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Arts: Popular revivals in London - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When money is short, it is a prudent opera company that strives to get
maximum mileage out of productions which it knows work well. Two revivals of
trusted stagings, one at each of the London opera-houses, returned at the
weekend and it is good to report that neither gives the impression merely of
a tired warhorse being trotted out for another run.
The Royal Opera's Il barbiere di Siviglia has arguably improved on each
occasion that it has been seen and this revival brings together some of the
best individual performances encountered so far: a cast confident of its
star appeal, balancing brash, youthful vigour with wily experience.
The main newcomer is Thomas Hampson in the title-role. This is his debut
with the Royal Opera, not before time, and an occasion which he enjoys to
the full, singing out proudly with his easy, impressive, ample baritone and
generally making sure that his role is the focus of attention. He bestrides
the stage with an overpowering all-American confidence, which is not
necessarily right for Rossini's lowly barber who lives by his wits alone,
but the flair is irresistible.
Alongside him are two American colleagues happily remembered from previous
revivals, Jennifer Larmore as an attractive, vocally sure Rosina and Bruce
Ford, a sensitive Count Almaviva with not quite enough personality. Simone
Alaimo creeps on as a spooky Don Basilio, the sepulchral presence cleverly
underplayed, the voice a real Italian Rossini bass. Not to be outdone,
Gabriel Bacquier's Doctor Bartolo proved a master at deploying the killing
comic touch at the most lethal moment and is still a singer of some force,
even though he will be 70 next year. Can the reference books really be
right?
All were kept firmly together by Evelino Pido, who trussed up the score
rather fearsomely, allowing few musical freedoms but kept the pace bright
and swift. He also encouraged his singers to bring along a selection of
their own vocal ornaments, which is all to the good. No lack of sparkle
there, or in any other department.
The conducting of Mark Elder was the feature that gave the strongest profile
to English National Opera's revival of Rigoletto on Thursday. Even when the
production was new (how long ago that seems now]) he did not bring it the
urgency, the powerful feeling of the music driving the drama forwards, that
made this performance so convincing.
Among the principals, the only newcomer here was Rosa Mannion, bravely
singing Gilda over, and at times audibly through, a heavy cold. Even in
these circumstances, however, the beauty of her singing shone forth and she
made the character tellingly progress, from the lightly floating virginal
purity of the early scenes to the tragic victim she becomes after the
abduction. Arthur Davies remains a dashing, youthful Duke, singing with
winning freedom, except when he is ambushed by vocal doubts in his Act 2
aria. Jonathan Summers is again the powerful, unsubtle Rigoletto, but one
who commands the stage.
According to the advertisements in the press, this now renowned mafioso
Rigoletto, like so many prima donnas who announce their retirement only to
re-appear, is again on the point of disappearing for good. If there really
is anybody who has not yet seen it, this is the last chance - and probably
as good a one as any.

Tomorrow's World (BBC 1, 7.30) asks who is going to pay to prop up Angkor

Conquest), which is now badly in need of restoration.
Indian archaeologists have been working away on the structure during the
years that Cambodia was closed to the rest of the world. Unfortunately, some

Migraine sufferers should cast an eye over Food File (C4, 8.30). The series

The moral majority may not have much say in controlling what manner of
art-works and performances we see in this country, but nevertheless, the
American experience is one which has an impact over here. Organisers of

So - there is all the more reason to catch the second showing of the
documentary about censorship which itself caused a furore, Damned in the USA

FT  10 FEB 93 / Management: Survival of the best qualified - Alan Cane
examines the strange case of the vanishing IT directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Information technology directors, sometimes called chief information
officers, enjoyed a brief moment of glory in the late 1980s. Since then,
they have begun to resemble an endangered species. A surprising number of
these highly qualified and capable individuals, including some well-known
names, have either resigned or lost their jobs.
Michael Earl, a professor at the London Business School, and Philip Vivian
of the executive search firm Egon Zehnder were intrigued by the 'mystery of
the vanishing CIOs' and set out to compile a survival kit* for what many now
acknowledge as the toughest job in a company, combining technical competence
with general management abilities.
CIOs emerged in the 1980s as the realisation grew that IT could have an
influence in a company well beyond cutting administrative costs. IT budgets
increased sharply on the promise of computer-based competitive advantage and
CIOs were appointed to manage and exploit the technology.
But CIOs made chief executives feel insecure. One told Earl and Vivian:
'What keeps me awake at night is not knowing whether my IT director is doing
a good job.'
Careful comparison between 10 CIO 'survivors' and 10 who had failed to stay
in post revealed five significant differences:
Relationship building. Survivors actively built relationships with their
peers and superiors in ways which enabled them to command support for IT
within the organisation. It took time and effort. One survivor claimed it
took two years to interest and educate a new senior executive.
Non-survivors, on the other hand, fought shy of these relationships. One
agreed he did not enjoy 'the diplomacy and politics required in a corporate
role'.
CEO relationship. Survivors were close to the CEO and enjoyed their support
for IT investments. Non-survivors had a poor or non-existent relationship
with their chief executive. Typical comments were: 'With successive
organisational changes, I became more remote from the managing director and
when we had a bad patch, I had no support or sponsor,' or: 'He was the wrong
guy to take IT forward; he was obsessed with costs.'
Shared IT vision. Survivors worked to create a vision for IT's contribution
to the business and made sure it was shared with the company's senior
executives. Non-survivors either hugged the vision to their chests: 'The
global information systems strategy was my vision alone,' or complained
about the lack of one: 'It was a very short-term sort of business.'
Sensitivity. Survivors seemed to have a fine sense of which battles to fight
and which to avoid: 'Be dynamic, but only in what the company is ready for,'
concluded one. Non-survivors, on the other hand, were often at odds with
senior management over important policy shifts. 'Being antagonistic once or
twice works, but in the long run it is wearing on people,' said one sacked
CIO.
Credibility. Survivors delivered the goods operationally. 'We are a
factory,' one survivor said. 'If the organisation is not satisfied with
operations the whole view of IT is affected,' said another.
Non-survivors often met neither performance nor financial targets.
Survivors also combined technical know-how with social skills and had spent
more time in data processing than non-survivors. General managers pressed
into the role of CIO prove unsatisfactory, Earl and Vivian conclude.
They suggest that chief executives should treat IT as a legitimate 'nursery'
for the company's best talent and seek to develop young executives' IT
expertise by a spell in data processing.
But CIOs find it hard to break out of the IT mould, even at a price. One
former CEO and CIO said: 'I want to take up a CEO job again, but I only get
offered CIO jobs. I would want four times the rate for being CIO that I
would accept for being CEO.'

FT  10 FEB 93 / Management: Resetting the clock - Asea Brown Boveri is
transforming its factories by slashing lead times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering giant, is going through
what it calls 'a new industrial revolution' in its plants around the world.
Known as the T50 strategy in Sweden, where it is most advanced, it has a
firm objective: to halve all lead times in the company's activities by the
end of this year. This is being done by decentralising work responsibilities
and widening individual worker skills within teams.
'We have made work cycle times the instrument for reform,' declares
Bert-Olof Svanholm, ABB's Swedish president, the inspiration behind T50.
'Time at work is a concept everybody can understand.'
The company can point to some early successes for the strategy. In its power
systems production it has cut the time for making high-voltage direct
current transmission equipment from three to two years. The time for
supplying customers with standard switchgear has fallen from three to five
weeks to three to five days from receipt of the order to delivery. Cycle
times in ABB's components division have been reduced from 86 to 35 days.
ABB started to introduce T50 into its Swedish plants in June 1990. In the
company's words it is 'a programme with a beginning but no end'. An
estimated half of the company's 32,000 Swedish workers are now involved
actively in the strategy with most of the rest in the initial stages. So far
the company claims that, on average, cycle times have been slashed by 21 per
cent and more than 300 high-performance teams have been created.
Until now, ABB argues, most companies have given the highest priority to
reforming direct production methods. 'For too long the direct production
area alone has been the autostrada of manufacturing and little attention was
being given to what happened before and after it,' explains Svanholm.
He draws inspiration for the strategy from the practice of lean management
so widespread in Japan's auto industry. 'We are trying to blend Japanese
methods with the Swedish work culture,' he explains.
The drive behind T50 has come from the top of ABB under the direction of
Percy Barnevik, the company's charismatic chief executive. He made his
senior managers read and digest the influential management study from the
Boston Consultancy group - Competing Against Time - when it was published
three years ago.
The company is perhaps better suited than most Swedish enterprises to
introduce the time-based concept into its operations. 'We have become a very
decentralised organisation over the past 10 years,' explains Svanholm. 'If
we had tried this in the old days of stratified management hierarchies there
would have been so much resistance and it would have been abandoned within a
fortnight.'
It was the structural change pushed through by Barnevik in Asea during the
early 1980s that paved the way. The T50 concept was a logical evolution from
the existing organisation, not a radical break with past practice.
T50's most important result has been to place the much-hyped, but
seldom-practised, principle of customer satisfaction at the centre of ABB's
priorities. 'The customers are our focus. We must respond to their demands
for the delivery of orders on time,' says Svanholm.
It is the close alliance forged between the company and the trade unions
that smoothed the way for T50. Indeed, says Svanholm, the trade unions at
ABB are as enthusiastic as the company in transforming the work process.
'They were in on the strategy from the start,' he points out.
According to Klaus Eklund, who headed a government-commissioned inquiry into
Sweden's productivity problems, ABB has gone much further than other
companies in creating 'a coalition between progressive management and
blue-collar unions in boosting productivity'.
The unions, moreover, have established their own committees to monitor T50
and make sure it works with the full involvement of their members. Without
such co-operation it is hard to see how T50 could make any headway in ABB's
Swedish plants, where the unions remain powerful.
In part, the strategy has developed in response to the expressed views of
the company's own employees. Three years ago ABB commissioned an independent
opinion survey of the shopfloor mood. It found that while manual as well as
white-collar workers were loyal and committed to the company they felt they
did not enjoy enough influence over their own working conditions, their work
was not being managed effectively enough and there was a lack of team
spirit.
Such findings strengthened Svandholm's conviction that the company needed to
reappraise its attitude to its own employees. 'We want to create a new kind
of independent-minded, all-round worker,' he explains. 'There is a lot of
bullshit in management theory about treating people as a human resource. But
too often that has meant very little in practice. We really do believe
workers should become adaptable and independent and as a result gain more
control over their own work.'
For ABB T-50 means the prospect of bigger profits, better productivity and
higher-quality products as well as lower absenteeism and labour turnover.
For the employees it means a better working environment, greater job
interest with constant skill upgrading, and eventually a better wage rate
linked more closely to individual effort.
The creation of what ABB calls Target Oriented High Performance work teams
made up of 10 to 15 workers is crucial to the T50 strategy. 'The old system
handed down orders from above through different, fragmented departments and
it was very time-consuming,' explains Kenneth Synnersten, ABB's executive
vice-president in charge of T50 in Sweden. 'Now we organise around the flow
of production through the team approach.'
The traditional system involved specialised demarcation of responsibilities
for sales, inventories, production and distribution with an inevitably high
level of bureaucratic managerial control and top-heavy administration. By
the creation of smaller, flexible teams with wider responsibilities, the
frontiers between administration and production have been abolished.
The new strategy has also brought the collapse of the barriers separating
white- from blue-collar workers. Now all ABB employees are called
'associates' and under new agreements will have the same pay rates, working
hours, holidays and travel allowances, although this has brought some
difficulty with some white-collar workers who fear a threat to their status.
T50 has also introduced what Svanholm calls a 'flat organisation with fewer
bosses and more workers taking on responsibilities'. As a result the
functions of ABB's line managers have been transformed.
'They have many more demanding job tasks to do now,' says Svanholm. 'Before
they were a combination of policeman and errand boy. Now they act as a
support for workers.' The foremen and the production engineer are being
turned into 'coaches' who move between the work teams to assist when needed.
The company puts a strong emphasis on training and education. The need to
upgrade worker skills lies at the heart of the T50 strategy. What ABB wants
is to heighten the competence of each worker within the team.
The strategy, however, is not trouble-free. It is being introduced at ABB in
the middle of recession. 'So far this has not affected the programme,'
insists Synnersten. But the strategy means a leaner workforce. Without any
growth in production up to a quarter of ABB's jobs may disappear as a
result.
'Yes, T50 will mean fewer jobs,' admits Anders Vallius from the Metalworkers
union. 'But if we can increase sales in the longer term then employment
opportunities will go up as well. We know ABB must stay ahead of its
competitors.'

FT  10 FEB 93 / People: Mathieson returns to Rover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the more senior Eindhoven-based sales and marketing executives of
DAF, the collapsed Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker, is back at a desk
within the UK's Rover Group.
The return to Rover of Sandy Mathieson (right), who is to become commercial
director of Rover's UK car sales, reunites some of the key figures who in
the 1980s shaped the fortunes of DAF's Birmingham-based vans subsidiary. The
latter is now - like the rest of DAF's UK operations - in the hands of
receivers.
Mathieson's welcome back on board at Rover, formerly British Leyland, is
courtesy of George Simpson, Rover's chairman. Simpson himself is a former
managing director of Leyland DAF, appointed soon after the formerly UK
State-owned Leyland truck and van operations were merged with DAF, under
Dutch control, in 1987.
Simpson first made his name, however, by turning round the vans operation -
then known as Freight Rover - into a profitable enterprise in the years
leading up to the DAF takeover. Mathieson was his right-hand-man as sales
and marketing director.
Mathieson will also be joining Graham Morris, managing director of Rover
Europe, who oversees sales and marketing operations for Rover cars and Land
Rover/Range Rover 4wd vehicles throughout Europe.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Jobs: At last, a gleam of practical intelligence - Despite
evidence on what really makes for high performance, employers stick to
faulty measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR all its own obdurate optimism, the Jobs column must bow to PA Consulting
Group when it comes to looking determinedly on the bright side.
After questioning 88 large employers in Britain, the group cheerily declares
that the freeze on the recruitment of university graduates is lifting. The
stated reason is that: 'Only 5 per cent of blue chip organisations surveyed
do not intend to recruit any graduates in 1993.'
How things have changed. It's not long since the opposite of a cheering
interpretation would have been put on the same survey finding, which could
equally well be re-worded to read: 'As many as one in every 20 big
organisations will be recruiting no graduates whatsoever.'
There is nevertheless little doubt that PA's happier wording will be thought
preferable by Britain's government. After all, its educational prescription
for the country's economic and social health is evidently to shackle
teachers ever more tightly to the task of getting their charges through a
succession of academic examinations, culminating in those for university
degrees.
True, no one has yet explained precisely how such exam-passing will increase
the nation's future well-being, and the results of past expansions of
degree-level study are hardly encouraging. But given ministers' enthusiasm
for expanding it still more, they must be comforted to see that 95 per cent
of big employers intend to take on at least one graduate.
Alas it may have blinded them to a couple of clouds no bigger than a man's
hand, which unlike the one made famous by the prophet Elijah are not
necessarily omens of good. The first cloud is represented by the appearance
of the Yale University psychologist Robert Sternberg at the Ciba
Foundation's recent London conference on human ability. The second is a
staff development programme at Nuclear Electric, the state-owned outfit
running nuclear power stations in England and Wales.
Professor Sternberg's research includes studies, in harness with
fellow-shrink Richard Wagner, into what makes for productive performance at
work. And one of the findings which he spelt out to the conference was that
results in academic exams are no guide to teaching or research ability, let
alone to practical and creative potential.
'Many people with high test scores at school will get good university
grades. But this doesn't indicate they will be successful in later life;
people with lower scores may be more successful,' he said. 'The bottom line
is that we need to recognise and think about giftedness in ways other than
just looking at academic standards. What matters at school doesn't matter
nearly so much in later life.'
The factor which does matter is what he calls tacit knowledge or practical
intelligence, which does not correlate with standard IQ. He defines it as
'knowledge that usually is not directly taught, spoken about or written
about, in contrast to knowledge directly taught in classroom' - the know-how
typically acquired in doing something for real. He and Dr Wagner have also
worked out methods of identifying same.
Now, one of the ways which history has shown to be least effective in
changing ingrained habits is to have them exposed as stupid by a professor
on the basis of cogent research. For example, the Jobs column described
Robert Sternberg's findings at length nearly eight years ago only to see
Britain's counter-productive obsession with exam-passing become more
compulsive still.
Even so, this time there is reason to hope the outcome may be different,
because Nuclear Electric has got into the act. It has taken the
Sternberg-Wagner ideas on the productive worth and indentification of tacit
knowledge, tested them carefully in the workplace, and - as was demonstrated
by the company's Max Choi at last month's British Psychological Society
conference - they work.
As a result, he said, 'our development programme is now focused on practical
intelligence.' And although Nuclear Electric is but one among many
employers, the intelligent step it has taken may point a better way to
greater well-being than all the graduate recruitment in the world.
MEANWHILE, whatever may become of PA's optimism about the employment
prospects of the next crop of degree-winners, its survey gives much
information about graduates of former years who not only found but are still
in jobs. As the underlying table gives only a sample of it, anyone wanting
the full report which is priced at Pounds 445 should contact Jenny Cambridge
at 123 Buckingham Palace Rd, London SW1W 9SR; tel (0)71-730 9000, fax
(0)71-333 5050.
My extract takes two sorts of employed graduates: one deemed adequate though
no more than that in the job, and the other considered a high-flier. The
table shows the typical pay of each sort after various lengths of time in 13
types of work. 'Accounting' covers the in-company variety as well as
professional practice, and the pay figures include bonuses in addition to
basic salary.
Where the types of work are ranked in the table is determined by the
differential which the high-flier enjoys over the adequate performer after
five years' service. The variances strike me at least as surprising, if not
downright bewildering. The range runs from nearly 32 per cent in the case of
production to a mere 2.2 per cent in chemical engineering.

government's decision on the funding bill.
In its 20 years, the Endangered Species Act has become one of the most
controversial environmental laws to hit the books. Species protection has
led to vitriolic, even violent, confrontations between environmentalists and
workers in sectors such as logging and fishing.
The power of the Act is forbidding. Soon after being signed into existence
in the 1970s, the ESA was used to delay construction of the Dollars 120bn
(Pounds 80bn) Tellico Dam in Tennessee to protect the rare snail darter
fish. The Act has continued to have far-reaching effects on land use
industries.
The confrontation in the Pacific Northwest between loggers and defenders of
the rare spotted owl became a 1992 election issue, and the theme of 'putting
people first' (before animals, that is) was at the heart of many of George
Bush's campaign speeches in the region. Loggers, with the support of the
then president, felt their jobs should take precedence over the rare bird's
habitat.
The Act has affected many other industries. Oil companies claim their
drilling activities have been limited unnecessarily. Farmers in the west
complain of severe grazing restrictions to protect certain species of bird.
And real estate developers in southern California are bitter over building
curbs to protect the kangaroo rat.
Under the decidedly pro-environmentalist Clinton administration, most
observers expect the Act to be not only renewed, but strengthened. Under
consideration will be:
Measures to speed up the process by which species are listed as endangered.
The possibility of listing entire ecosystems, not just species, under the
Act.
Increased funding for policing of the Act.
Harsher penalties for offenders.
Possible compensation for landowners who find endangered species on their
property.
The ESA has ardent supporters and detractors. Its most extreme opponents
propose listing rare animals as 'relic species' which could not adapt to the
late 20th century. Instead of maintaining a natural habitat for these
species, these activists propose breeding the animals in captivity in order
to prevent their extinction.
Certain 'dune-buggy' recreation clubs have claimed that their right to ride
vehicles on beaches and desert turf should take priority over the
preservation of animal and bird life. And stories have circulated in the
Florida press about landowners who poisoned rare turtles nesting on their
property rather than face building restrictions.
More moderate opponents of the ESA say it threatens many Americans'
livelihood. A particularly bitter battle is brewing over the rights of
shrimpers in the Gulf of Mexico. Gulf coast shrimpers are angry about turtle
excluder devices (Teds) which they have been forced to install in their
netting. The device is a kind of trap door which allows sea turtles to
escape.
'The problem is, it also lets the shrimp out,' says Darcy Keefe, a
fourth-generation shrimper. 'We'd like to comply with the law, but we also
have to make a living.' Keefe says most of his shrimping colleagues have
been forced out of business by the ESA.
The National Wildlife Federation in Washington DC, however, claims Teds are
one of the Act's biggest success stories. According to the federation, the
devices annually save about 55,000 sea turtles that would otherwise drown in
shrimp nets. And a study released by the organisation last year claimed that
Teds actually caused little hardship. The report noted a 15 per cent
increase in shrimpers' average daily catch since the Ted regulations
applied.
Shrimpers say the study tells only one side of the story. 'Each vessel may
be catching more shrimp, but that's partly because there are fewer shrimping
boats out there,' says Keefe. 'And the Teds are heavy; they stretch our
nets, and we have to pay the extra cost.'
In another bitter ESA dispute, the Pacific Northwest Generating
Co-operative, which provides hydro-electric energy to many communities in
the northwestern states, says it faces additional costs of between Dollars
1bn and Dollars 5bn to save rare salmon on the Columbia River.
Environmentalists would like the company to aid salmon migration by drawing
down reservoirs behind the dams to push up water levels at certain times of
the year. But the company says that would mean prohibitively expensive
alterations to the dams already in place on the river.
'It's not just the hydro-electric power that's at risk,' says David Harper,
director of legislation for the group. 'Changing the river levels would have
an impact on shipping along the waterway, which in turn affects farmers
trying to get their wheat to port.'
The history of the ESA is littered with smaller casualties, too. Edward Lee
of Kansas used to make a living by collecting gravel from streams to sell to
businesses. A few years ago, he was forced to shut his operation in order to
protect an endangered catfish laying eggs in the gravel. Richard Christie, a
Montana rancher, found himself unwittingly in violation of the law when he
shot and killed a grizzly bear that was feeding on his sheep.
Opponents of the ESA say that environmentalists often invoke the law to
protect land they prefer to see undeveloped. But many environmentalists
contend there is nothing wrong with this approach.
'Many of the industries which are affected by the law make money by abusing
public resources,' says Michael Bean, chairman of wildlife for the Wildlife
Defence Fund in Washington DC. 'We are in many cases faced with inadequate
land use restrictions.'
In spite of the strong emotions, some activists are convinced that
compromise is possible. One success story is a deal between
environmentalists and Louisiana loggers to protect the black bear. The
loggers promised to leave tree corridors to allow the bears free access to
their hunting areas. The environmentalists, for their part, agreed to allow
a certain amount of logging in the bears' habitat.
An unlikely alliance has also formed between some environmentalists and
property rights activists, who are pushing Congress to offer financial
incentives to landowners who find rare species.
'We've heard the stories about turtle poisonings in Florida,' says Adam
Roberts, research assistant for the Animal Welfare Institute in Washington
DC. 'Obviously, we don't want that to happen, so we're lobbying for better
compensation to property owners.'
Activists on both sides of the issue are also pushing for earlier listings
to prevent crisis confrontations. One Louisiana logger pointed out that the
black bear was a legal hunting target until shortly before listing as an
endangered species.
'We believe the Act could be more efficient if listings occurred earlier,'
says Kathleen Hartnett, a director of the National Cattlemen's Association.
'And we also think the law could be applied more efficiently.'
Hartnett points to the ESA's limited success in restoring many species to
healthy levels. Hundreds of species have been added to the list, which is
expected to top 1,100 by 1996, but only five have recovered enough to be
removed from it.
'We think more money should be applied to the recovery of species which
stand a real chance, while others should be abandoned as basket cases,' says
Hartnett.
Although opponents and supporters of the Act are beginning to work together,
the two sides are probably on course for more bitter clashes over the next
few years.
And if the Act is strengthened, as is expected, land use industries in the
US may have even more to lose in the battle to preserve biodiversity in the
US.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Sceptical ears are deaf to old
refrain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Destruction, deterioration and degradation of the environment is the refrain
of the 10th edition of State of the World, the annual bible of the
Worldwatch Institute, a Washington DC-based think tank known for its gloomy
forecasts of the world's future.
The institute and its founder, Lester Brown, have built a considerable
international reputation on the back of this annual compilation* of reports
and essays, translated into 27 languages.
But despite this year's emphasis on the economic costs of environmental
damage, the book is part of that broad stream of environmental writing
likely to be of interest mainly to the converted.
The collection - each of the nine chapters by a different author - bombards
the reader with warnings of disaster and exhortations to action, from
reviving coral reefs to 'rediscovering rail' and 'preparing for peace'.
This apparent lack of discrimination between problems is particularly marked
in Brown's opening chapter, which crams a reference to most environmental
issues into 17 pages. The problems have never been greater, he claims, while
faith in science to solve them has shrunk.
Assumptions are presented as fact in sub-clauses such as ' . . . given the
deteriorating state of the planet . . . ' along with other highly debatable
views.
One of his central claims is that 'the environmentally destructive
activities of recent decades are now showing up in reduced productivity of
croplands, forests and fisheries . . . in rising health care costs for
cancer, birth defects, allergies, emphysema, asthma'. However, these
sweeping assertions ignore the argument that increased incidence of cancer
in industrialised societies is partly due to people living longer - by many
standards a success. Nor do they question how much food production in Africa
or the former Soviet Union has been affected by political disruption.
His most ambitious claim is perhaps that we have arrived at 'the end of
rapid GNP growth', and that the 'worldwide' recession he has identified is
caused partly by 'environmental degradation'. His study quotes scientific
reports suggesting that annual 'losses' from sulphur deposits on European
forests could be Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) a year. However it does not
attempt to offset these against the extra costs that would fall on industry
from cleaning up, and so is able to reach the conclusion that such pollution
is causing a 'heavy economic toll'.
A reluctance to recognise successful responses to threats is also detectable
in statements such as: 'In Rio (at last year's Earth Summit) the risks to
life posed by the loss of stratospheric ozone were on everyone's mind, a
threat not even imagined in 1972.' But treaties to phase out ozone-depleting
chemicals were in place at that point, which gave many Rio delegates hope
that more complex problems of climate change could be successfully tackled.
When pressed on these questions face to face, Brown gives clearer answers
than his text, and ranks population growth and global warming as the most
important threats. Many would agree with those priorities, including the new
Clinton administration, which has just indicated that it will restore public
funding for the United Nations Population Fund, curtailed in the 1980s
because of domestic objections to work involving abortion.
Although reluctant, like many environmentalists, to welcome nuclear power as
a solution to the carbon dioxide problem, he says: 'Our objections are not
for ideological reasons but for economic ones - it doesn't look to us as
though nuclear is going to make it.' He also argues: 'I'm not saying there
aren't solutions for environmental problems, just that we can't keep on
doing what we're doing.'
However, few of those qualifications have made it into print. This year's
Worldwatch report is dispiriting because of what it suggests about the state
of environmental debate, rather than the state of the world.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Ofgas chief to quit as soon as monopoly report is published
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR James McKinnon, the gas industry regulator, is to step down in
September, almost a year before the end of his contract.
Sir James, renowned for his acerbic manner and combative style, said
yesterday he would leave his post as director general of the regulatory body
Ofgas after the publication of a report on British Gas by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, due in July.
'That report is bound to propose some fundamental changes to the business
and I believe a new person should follow through those changes from
beginning to end,' he said.
Sir James's announcement came as Ofgas became embroiled in another row with
British Gas over complaints from customers last year. Ofgas said complaints
had risen by 89 per cent to 1,624, but British Gas said it was not aware of
more than half those.
Relations between the company and the regulator have been rancorous and have
recently sunk to an all-time low.
But Sir James, 63, attacked his critics yesterday: 'Many people are
perplexed at the aura of tension between British Gas and Ofgas, but to think
there would be no conflict between a regulator and monopoly supplier is
somewhat naive.'
Without the scrutiny of Ofgas, there would not be the 'tension and acrimony'
that had developed, Sir James said, 'but neither would there be the results
achieved'. He pointed to a 20 per cent drop in gas prices in real terms
since privatisation in 1986 as one of his greatest achievements.
Ofgas yesterday accused British Gas of over-charging schools for gas supply
by at least Pounds 2,000 a year each when they opt out of local authority
control.
British Gas points to a legal technicality which means the company must
charge schools separately for gas and not as bulk purchasers under a local
authority. This increases the price by 10p a therm since bulk purchasers are
eligible for a quantity discount.
'Schools' budgets are strapped in many ways and you can imagine they are
aggrieved with British Gas's treatment,' said Mr Greg McGregor, director of
competition and tariffs at Ofgas.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Sapin wants closer German ties: Bonn expresses caution over
fast-track union between franc and D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, pledged his commitment
yesterday to closer monetary co-operation with Germany. But finance ministry
officials rejected speculation that Bonn and Paris might permanently fix a
rate between their currencies.
Senior officials at the French finance ministry confirmed that the two
countries did envisage closer co-operation on questions such as intervention
in the foreign exchange markets, but without specific measures to formalise
their ties.
At the same time, senior officials in Bonn cautioned strongly against
expectations of a 'fast track' monetary union between the D-Mark and the
French franc, or between the five inner core currencies of the European
Monetary System, before the strict economic convergence criteria of the
Maastricht treaty had been fulfilled.
They said the Bundesbank and Chancellor Helmut Kohl had repeatedly stressed
the need to fulfil the convergence requirements, including lower inflation,
sharply reduced budget deficits, and strict control over state debts.
Germany faces difficulty fulfilling the first two criteria before 1996.
The comments come at a time of persistent speculation, particularly in Paris
and Brussels, about the possibility of France and Germany stepping up
monetary co-operation if the continued instability of the foreign exchange
markets threatens the long-term future of the EMS.
The French finance ministry dismissed as 'absolutely without foundation'
reports that the two countries might agree a fixed exchange rate between
their currencies. Mr Sapin also stressed that the French and German
governments did not intend to take monetary measures which would exclude
other European currencies.
'The European currency will not be simply a Franco-German one,' he said. 'I
would say 'yes' to the idea of Franco-German co-operation being the hard
core of the European monetary system, but I would say 'no' to the idea of
other countries being excluded.'
In Bonn, Mr Rene Monory, president of the French Senate and a leading member
of the opposition UDF, called for a fast track to a single European currency
to end recent speculative attacks against individual currencies in the EMS.
However, the debate is being treated with great caution in the main German
government ministries and with virtual disdain in the Bundesbank in
Frankfurt.
'The pressure is coming from France, from the French opposition, but they
have not given us any idea of the mechanics,' according to one well-placed
official.
'The Bundesbank is very reticent about the whole idea. It would seriously
limit its room for manoeuvre,' he added.
Another senior official said the proposals for a fast track monetary union
were 'a crisis scenario, not a government scenario. The French have to say
how they would do it.'
A German finance ministry official said: 'One can fantasise about things
like a fast-track solution, but we have not been asked to.'

FT  10 FEB 93 / Autobahn drivers face annual fee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S ruling coalition yesterday approved plans to privatise its 7,000
miles of motorways and charge foreign and domestic motorists for using them.
Under the plan, German motorists are to be charged an annual fee for using
the country's autobahn network. Foreign motorists passing through will have
to pay a fee and display window stickers to drive on an autobahn.
The fee is to be introduced next January, and will be in addition to the
normal car tax paid by German motorists.
A commission headed by the transport ministry has until March 10 to examine
the users' fee. Last Friday, Mr Gunther Krause, the transport minister, drew
sharp criticism when he said he was considering a fee of up to DM400 (Pounds
166).
The move to charge for using German autobahns, which lie at at the heart of
Europe's high-speed road transport system, is expected to run into
resistance from ordinary motorists as well as the German car industry.
Plans to introduce a similar system for trucks was abandoned last year after
opposition from Brussels and the motor industry.
The government, which is struggling to reduce a large deficit and find funds
to rebuild east Germany, is pursuing privatisation to raise additional
revenue.
The move is intended to help finance the urgently needed restructuring of
the loss-making railways. The German rail system, which has recorded profits
only once since the second world war, is expected to be DM60bn in debt by
the end of the year. Its 1992 loss is estimated at around DM14bn.
'To finance the reforms of the rail system, the coalition parties have
agreed to the eventual privatisation of the motorway network,' said Mr
Dieter Vogel, government spokesman for the three-party coalition.
The government hopes a levy will encourage travellers to switch from
motorways to trains.
Although no details were released about when or how the government would
privatise the national road network, a government official said the first
step would be to ensure that projects for modernising motorways in the east
were privately financed.
Last year the government discussed what it called a 'concessionary' model,
in which private groups could finance and build rail and road projects on
the government's behalf.

The attempt by British Gas to portray itself as exercising self-restraint on
pricing cut little ice with either the regulator or the market. Yesterday
Ofgas said its reading of the gas price index did not justify price rises in
the first place. Whichever side is right, the exchange is a side-show to the
main event at the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Even confirmation that
the combative Sir James McKinnon will step down from Ofgas this year did
nothing to lift the shares. They are likely to under-perform until the
outcome of MMC review is clear.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Duty to report suspicions of bank
fraud moves closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to give auditors a statutory duty to report suspicion of fraud on the
part of their client banks to the Bank of England will take a step forward
later this month when the government publishes a consultation paper.
The paper, which follows consultation with the professional institutes, will
include draft regulations setting out the new duties for auditors of banks,
building societies, friendly societies and some companies.
The Treasury hopes the extensive discussions it has already held with the
profession mean that the official consultation period can be relatively
short and it can proceed with legislation in the autumn. It is seeking
legislative time in the next parliamentary session, but is not guaranteed a
slot in the programme.
Labour is critical of the delay so far because ministers said the move was a
matter of urgency after the Bingham report into the collapse of BCCI.
'I'm dismayed by the government's lack of urgency,' said Mr Alistair
Darling, a Labour Treasury spokesman.
The accountancy profession initially argued that there was no need for
legislation on the duty to report fraud, since auditors had this requirement
in their guidelines.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour hopes to be champion of
businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GORDON BROWN will today stake Labour's claim as the champion of small and
medium-sized businesses, as the party continues its co-ordinated campaign to
seize the middle-ground of politics.
Following party leader Mr John Smith's rejection of traditional policy
dogmas on Sunday, the shadow chancellor will set out Labour's position
against 'entrenched' economic interests, such as banks and utilities,
arguing that their influence means businesses and ordinary citizens lost
out.
Urging moves towards increased competition and more effective regulation, Mr
Brown will tell an audience of Labour backbenchers that the government is
incapable of addressing the problems these entrenched interests create.
He will call for an immediate Mergers and Monopolies Commission inquiry into
the small business services provided by banks, which Labour believes are
exercising too much power with too little responsibility.
To back his claim, Mr Brown will publish figures alleging that, in the four
years to 1991 when thousands of small companies were going bankrupt, the
high street banks substantially raised their dividends.
The party yesterday signalled a fresh offensive in its campaign for
root-and-branch reform of financial services regulation, calling for a
'complete overhaul' of the present self-regulatory regime.
In an early day motion tabled by all three junior front-bench Treasury
spokesmen, Labour asserted that the present seven-year-old system had
failed. It also called for a 'proper and effective' replacement 'without
further delay'.
The motion stopped short of demanding a supra-regulatory body, such as the
US Securities and Exchange Commission the motion said the new regime should
be 'supervised by a majority of those representing the public interest and
not by a convention of vested interests of the industry.'
It noted that no 'adequate' regulatory regime was 'likely to be in place
before 1994'. It said any new system 'must have sufficient power and
resources to regulate the sale of financial products.'
The motion concluded by attacking the government's failure to 'take any
interest' in the subject, which it said illustrated it had 'chosen to side
with the vested interests of the industry rather than the interests of the
public'.
The government has ruled out bringing forward fresh legislation, indicating
it would prefer to see reform within the existing system.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said last year that
tougher control of City institutions by regulators was needed to overcome
shortcomings in present laws.
A second Labour motion, tabled by the same group of frontbenchers, sought to
highlight problems associated with home income plans - a financial product
sold mainly to elderly people in the late 1980s as a means of releasing
income from their homes.

A NEW levy on dumping waste in landfills would encourage more incineration

The report, by Coopers &amp; Lybrand for the Department of the Environment, says
a levy on landfills - licensed pits for dumping rubbish - would be feasible.
Its main effect would be to increase the amount of waste sent to
incinerators, but in the long term it would make recycling more commercially
attractive.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welsh reforms may cost Pounds 154m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REFORM of local government in Wales which will see the end of two-tier
authorities will cost between Pounds 61m and Pounds 154m over 15 years,
according to a report for the government by management consultants Touche
Ross.
Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, is expected to decide in the next few
weeks on the exact form of the reorganisation. The eight counties and 37
district councils are to be replaced by unitary authorities.
A Welsh Office discussion paper last year suggested the 45 councils could be
replaced by 15, 18, 23 or 27 unitary authorities. Touche Ross says the
15-council option would cost between Pounds 61m and Pounds 154m, and the
27-authority option would cost between Pounds 67m and Pounds 152m.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith urges west to help east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH yesterday called on the west to launch a concerted effort to
address the economic problems of the new eastern European democracies and
the developing world, Ivo Dawnay writes.
Calling for a new Marshall plan for eastern Europe, the Labour leader used a
speech in Athens to question the austerity measures being imposed on the new
democracies by international banks and institutions.
In his debut as chairman of the Socialist International's economic
committee, he argued that the G7 group of industrialised western powers
needed a statesman to galvanise assistance to the east.
He also called on the European Community to reach a compromise with the US
to ensure that a rapid agreement was reached on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont hears Tory views on VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor, heard some support last night from Tory
MPs for an extension of the value added tax base but at the same time was
warned not to introduce measures in the March 16 Budget that would threaten
economic recovery.
At a meeting of the Conservative backbench finance committee there was also
backing for Treasury plans to tackle the public sector borrowing requirment,
starting as early as the December Budget.
The meeting of about 40 MPs, at which Mr Lamont did not speak, heard calls
for VAT to be extended, perhaps to newspapers, in order to boost Treasury
revenues. But in a sombre atmopshere there was no consensus and other Tories
would be unhappy with any tax rises.
Last night's session marked the end of an extensive consultation exercise Mr
Lamont has had with Tory MPs over Budget alternatives.
Tory MPs remain jittery about the fragility of any recovery and were divided
about whether interest rates should be cut further - or should have been cut
as far as they have.
Earlier, Mr John Major was forced on the defensive in the Commons over the
Conservative party's election pledge not to extend the scope of VAT.
The prime minister's repeated attempts to hold to the customary formula,
that he could not comment on possible tax changes with the March 16 Budget
just five weeks away, were brushed aside by Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy
Labour leader.
Mrs Beckett recalled that during last year's general election campaign Mr
Major said the government had no plans to extend VAT and that there was no
need to do so. She demanded: 'Do you stand by those words?'
Mr Major replied: 'You know we are near to the Budget. You must wait.'
The Treasury's long-term spending review is already under way. Mr Michael
Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, has had preliminary meetings with
colleagues at the departments of health and education and at the Home Office
as part of his review of public spending.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government beats off revolt on
leasehold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Government comfortably beat off a rebellion by London-based Tory
backbenchers in the Commons last night as the Housing and Urban Development
bill moved to its report stage.
Sir John Wheeler, the MP for Westminster North, and Mr Dudley Fishburn, the
MP for Kensington, had both said they would be voting against the
government.
But a Labour amendment seeking to extend the government's leasehold reform
proposals to properties with a high ground rent was defeated by 294 votes to
252, a government majority of 42.
The bill would give up to 750,000 leaseholders the right to buy the freehold
of their property, enabling tenants for example to join to buy the freehold
of their block of flats.
Groups of Tory back-benchers supporting the interests of private landlords
and tenants with long leases have each been endeavouring to swing the
reforms in their favour.
The landlords' lobby yesterday backed away from confrontation, withdrawing
proposals for a tightly drawn residency qualification without forcing a vote
after the govern-ment offered minor concessions.
Mr Fishburn said the low-rent test provision that the defeated amendment
would have struck out would create a two-tier property market. 'In effect,
whole swathes of London will be disenfranchised and whole armies of Tory
voters will feel let down.'
Sir John said the test was there to address a situation that 'simply does
not exist.' If not removed, it would 'come back to haunt us again and
again.'
For the government, Sir George Young, housing minister, said the test
provided 'an important distinction' between the rental and long-lease
markets.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs seek further reversals in Army
manpower reductions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CROSS-PARTY Commons committee yesterday demanded further changes in the
government's plans for reducing the size of the Army.
The defence committee, triumphant after the partial climbdown last week by
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, called for the cancellation of
further plans to merge or disband infantry regiments.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative chairman of the committee, said members
were unanimous that Mr Rifkind's decision to restore 3,000 Army posts and to
cancel two regimental amalgamations was not enough.
Last week's change increased the target for Army personnel in the mid-1990s
from 116,000 to 119,000 compared with about 145,000 at present. Mr Rifkind
told BBC radio that a further increase was highly improbable. But Sir
Nicholas said: 'We are an extremely dogged committee, and we don't take no
for an answer.'
The number of infantry battalions - excluding the Brigade of Gurkhas - has
been reduced since last July from 50 to 45. Under the government's original
Options for Change plans it was due to be reduced to 36. The revised
government plan means two more will be retained, but the committee is
arguing for the number to be kept at 45.
The committee attacked the government's decision to make cuts in other areas
of its defence budget to pay the Pounds 80m annual cost of its revised plan.
Sir Nicholas said it was 'not unrealistic' to ask the Treasury to review
reductions in defence spending set out in last November's public spending
round.
The committee's report, prepared before the change in Army plans, warned of
'chronic overstretch' and attacked the restructuring plans as 'inappropriate
and ill-advised'.
In contrast to the Army, the RAF is expected to make more drastic cuts than
foreseen in the Options for Change review, to fewer than 70,000 instead of
the expected 75,000. RAF chiefs aim to cut support services to a minimum in
a move to preserve front-line units and safeguard equipment plans.
Mr Rifkind yesterday moved to deflect some of the fallout from the
committee's report by attacking disarray in the Labour party over defence.
In the Commons he attacked Mr John Reid, a Labour frontbench spokeman,
telling him to 'start converting' his own party supporters before seeking to
give instructions to Conservative MPs. Mr Reid claimed the committee's
report showed that the government had no strategy on defence, no policy on
security and 'no idea where it is going'.
He suggested that instead of indulging in U-turns and staggering from pillar
to post over the amalgamation of regiments the government should instigate a
full defence review as advocated by Labour leaders.

Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, is expected to decide in the next few

The government's favoured option is thought to be 23 authorities although
the eight counties are pressing for the number to be 15.
Compensation for loss of office among the 90,000 council employees will be
the main cost - between Pounds 20m and Pounds 90m.
Mr Hunt said that he expected the actual costs to be 'towards the lower end
of the range'.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers look at landfill issue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW levy on dumping waste in landfills would encourage more incineration
and recycling of rubbish, according to a report commissioned by the
government.
The report, by Coopers &amp; Lybrand for the Department of the Environment, says
a levy on landfills - licensed pits for dumping rubbish - would be feasible.
Its main effect would be to increase the amount of waste sent to
incinerators, but in the long term it would make recycling more commercially
attractive.
Mr David Maclean, environment minister, said the report 'forms part of the
government's programme of work to explore the use of economic instruments in
environmental policy'. Environmentalists welcomed the encouragement a levy
might give to recycling, but were uneasy about an increase in incineration.
The issue of disposal of solid rubbish has become increasingly controversial
as the shortcomings of each method have become clear. Following
environmental pressure, the terms of licences for landfill operators have
been steadily tightened. The report argues that landfill costs will rise
'substantially' before 2000 even without a levy because of tighter rules and
the difficulty of finding new sites.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Pollution liability 'threatens financing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLOWS OF capital to industry could be 'seriously impeded' because bankers
and insurers are afraid of future environmental costs, a government advisory
committee warned yesterday.
Changes in the laws on environmental liability 'could have profound and
adverse consequences for business across all sectors', the working group
said in a report to the trade and industry and environment departments.
One banker said yesterday: 'The critical issue is whether banks who take
property or land as security could be held to be liable for its pollution.
It could be something a sensible bit of due diligence can deal with, or it
could be a time bomb; it's too early to know.'
Mr Tony Baker of the Association of British Insurers said: 'Recent legal
trends are hastening the day when insurers will be unable to offer pollution
cover as a part of standard policies.'
It amended its recommended policy wordings restricting coverage to sudden
and accidental pollution in 1990.
Companies have become increasingly concerned that they could be liable for
damages and clean-up costs under recent UK and EC environmental legislation.
UK court cases have raised questions of whether the principle of
'retrospective liability' for past pollution that met the environmental
standards of the day would become widely applied.
The 14-strong group, which is chaired by Mr Derek Wanless of National
Westminster Bank, also criticises recent government proposals for a register
of contaminated land for assessing only the past use of land and not the
degree of pollution.
The Financial Sector Working Group produced the report for the Advisory
Committee on Business and the Environment, which is a group of senior
businesspeople set up to advise the trade and industry and environment
departments on environmental issues from a business perspective.
Bankers and insurers welcomed the report. Lloyds Bank said: 'We endorse the
committee's comments and are looking at the issue seriously.'
Mr Tom Symes, head of the environmental department at Nabarro Nathanson, the
solicitors, said 'Insurers will certainly welcome the conclusions of the
report. What they need is to have the position of potential retrospective
liability clarified, particularly if any strict liability wordings are
agreed by the EC.'
However, others warned that such fears may be overblown - at least until
there is a longer record of court cases or changes in legislation. A
director of the credit rating department of a City merchant bank said: 'We
have been unable to complete some transactions because of unresolved
environmental problems, mainly to do with land, but the banking world has
sometimes got a bit paranoid about the issue. Just because there is
pollution doesn't mean there will be huge claims.'
Ms Sarah Gooden, of Gouldens, the firm of solicitors, said: 'It is a big
issue, but it is possible the banks are more worried than they need to be:
they sometimes fix on potential problems and take some time to get
comfortable with them.'

FT  10 FEB 93 / Receivers expect Daf break-up: Talk of non-EC buyer 'very
premature' - Attempt to reassure dealers / Major rejects Labour call for
government aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECEIVERS for Leyland Daf believe that several parts of its operations
can survive last week's collapse into receivership, but the group will
probably have to be broken into its constituent parts. There will be heavy
job losses and some locations are likely to be closed.
Talk of an outside buyer - speculation has focused on truckmakers such as
Paccar of the US and Hino of Japan - is 'very premature' and no formal
contacts have been made.
In the first week since their appointment last Wednesday as joint
administrative receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of
accountants Arthur Andersen have done little but fight immediate fires. Mr
McKillop said: 'Our main aim has been to stabilise the sales and production
operations. Then you can have a stabilised business to sell, but it is still
very premature to talk about a sale.'
To date the receivers have:
Agreed financing for the short-term working capital needs of Leyland Daf
amounting to Pounds 7m - the sum they requested from Daf's banking
consortium.
Made arrangements for the immediate payment of wages and salaries for the
5,500-strong workforce in the UK.
Set about restoring production at the truck plant at Leyland, Lancashire,
and at the Birmingham van plant. Made arrangements with the court-appointed
administrators for Daf in the Netherlands that should allow the resumption
of the 'vital' flow of trucks and components between the UK and the Dutch
and Belgian operations.
Addressed a full meeting of UK dealers to try to maintain some confidence in
the dealer network.
All these actions may secure the businesses for a few weeks, but the hard
task will now begin of assessing what can be salvaged for the long term.
The UK receivers believe that the rescue plan being prepared by the Dutch
administrators - which calls for the creation of a new limited company with
the working title of New Daf - could make good sense.
This would absorb the core operations of Daf's Dutch and Belgian medium and
heavy-duty truck activities. Most importantly for the UK, however, New Daf
would probably also include Leyland Daf's truck assembly operations at
Leyland.
The UK receivers will develop this plan at a further meeting with the Dutch
administrators, Mr Louis Deterink and Mr Friso Meeter, later this week. Both
sides believe at present that New Daf's future lies in being able to
continue to offer an integrated product range to the 1,300-strong Daf dealer
network across Europe.
This product range would include light trucks made at Leyland and the medium
and heavy-duty trucks made at Eindhoven in the Netherlands, with cabs coming
from Westerlo, Belgium.
'The key concept is to try to keep that integrated product range together,'
said Mr McKillop. 'For the core business the sum of the whole is worth much
more than the sum of the parts.'
The Leyland plant also has two lucrative military contracts with the
Ministry of Defence, one of which runs until early 1995.
Mr McKillop rejected the criticism that the New Daf rescue plan is inimical
to UK interests. He said: 'There will be severe pain too in Holland and
Belgium.'
The ownership of a slimmed-down Leyland truck assembly operation within New
Daf is still to be resolved. It could be wholly or part-owned by New Daf or
could be partly owned by UK interests. The vital element, however, is that
this operation would be tied by ownership or supply contracts to New Daf and
would remain an integrated part of the Daf truck range.
Even under this plan there will still have to be painful job cuts at
Leyland. Only half of around 2,200 employees there are employed in the
assembly plant. Some 430 are involved in components assembly, 340 in truck
product development and 160 in headquarters administration. Many of these
jobs are now at risk, as are some of the assembly jobs.
The Birmingham van operation appears at much greater risk, however. Its
long-term future depended on Daf's ambitious joint venture with Renault of
France to develop a new generation of medium and heavy vans, code-named
Excel, for launch in the mid 1990s. This product was to have replaced the
present ageing Daf 200/400 series - the former British Leyland Freight Rover
vans - and was to have been built both in Birmingham and at Renault's plant
at Batilly in eastern France.
As far as Daf and the future of the Birmingham plant are concerned, this
project appears to be dead. It is understood that even before the company
went into receivership last week, Daf had decided that it would have to pull
out of the Excel project because it did not have the finance to continue.
Renault and Daf have each spent around Pounds 45m on Excel, but it is
estimated that a further Pounds 100m must be spent to complete the
development work with another Pounds 100m-Pounds 200m needed to bring it
into production.
Excel has now become one of the receivers' most pressing problems. Around
270 Leyland Daf jobs in the UK, mainly in Birmingham, are tied up with the
project and are immediately at risk. Urgent discussions are being held with
Renault to clarify whether it intends to press ahead with the project alone
or with another partner.
Without Excel and excluded from the core truck strategy of New Daf the
Birmingham plant - with around 2,000 jobs - faces a most difficult future.
The receivers believe that it could survive in much reduced form, however,
with a strategy directed towards producing very basic, low-price utility
vans, essentially for the UK market only, and for a core of loyal, large
fleet customers.
This plan is still at an early stage and would probably require a management
buy-out and may need to be kick-started by some form of government selective
regional assistance.
At Glasgow the receivers will seek to make the Albion van and truck axle
plant into an independent operation with the hope of selling it to an
engineering sector buyer. As a supplier to Leyland and Birmingham its future
will be tied closely to the ability to save these plants in some form, and
again heavy job losses are inevitable.
At Chorley, Lancashire, Leyland Daf has a modern automated warehouse and
distribution operation with an annual turnover of around Pounds 100m and a
workforce of some 400. At present this activity is excluded from the plan
for New Daf, but the receivers believe it could well attract an outside
buyer as a going concern.
Parts sales are a vital element in any truck manufacturer's profitability,
however - much better returns are derived from the after-sales operations
than from the sale of the new vehicle itself - so New Daf would be vitally
interested in a continuing link with the parts business.
The Leyland Daf sales and marketing operation at Thame, Oxfordshire, which
has about 330 employees, is expected to be reduced in size and will probably
be moved. New Daf will have to have a sales and marketing operation in the
UK, however, to run the dealer network, so a slimmed-down operation is
expected to survive, although at another location and with the nature of the
ownership still to be clarified.
Leyland Daf Finance is not in receivership in the UK but the Dutch
administrators have said that Daf Finance, its Dutch parent company, will be
'run down and closed'.
Whatever strategies are evolved by the administrators and receivers for Daf
and Leyland Daf, considerable job losses are inevitable. The pain is likely
to begin before the end of this week.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Yarrow warship yard closes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHIPYARD worker Bobby Graham gazes at the strike-bound Yarrow shipyard on
the river Clyde in Glasgow. He and 1,300 others are on strike for the first
time in years, seeking a 'substantial' pay rise. Next door is Leyland Daf's
plant where 550 workers are waiting to hear their fate, while nearby is a
Nestle biscuit factory where up to 550 workers could lose their jobs when
production moves south.
The Yarrow warship yard has been closed since Friday in one of the biggest
pay disputes in Britain for several years. The strikers want a substantial
increase on their basic weekly rate of Pounds 218 for a skilled worker. The
company has offered a Pounds 300 lump sum for the year to July followed by a
3.8 per cent rise for the following 12 months.
Meanwhile Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday rebuffed fresh calls
for the government to intervene to help rescue Daf vehicle plants.
His comments provoked an angry reaction from Labour MPs in the Commons and
came after Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said Britain
should follow the example of the Netherlands and offer financial support.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Complaints for Ofgas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RANGE of complaints in the annual report of Ofgas runs from crossed
meters to disconnection problems, theft from gas meters and accounting
errors.
One customer ended up with arrears of Pounds 880.20 because he was connected
to the wrong gas meter. When he complained to British Gas, the company
offered to write off half the bill but Ofgas persuaded it to write off the
whole account.
Another customer complained after gas bills and a disconnection notice were
sent to his deceased mother's account in spite of his informing British Gas
several times of her death.
The company paid the customer Pounds 250 compensation for distress caused.
An industrial customer was charged Pounds 1,596.43 after using a gas-fired
fan heater for four months. When he asked the manufacturer whether the
heater could burn 86,063kW-hours in the time stated, he was told that if the
fan heater was on for 24 hours at maximum output it could burn only
6,992kW-hours.
The customer received an account reduction of Pounds 1,200.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Contractors warn over threat to tendering: Companies tell
Catherine Milton and Gillian Tett that EC rules may wreck the government's
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT contractors yesterday issued a warning that confusion over
employment legislation could wreck the Conservatives' plans to increase
market testing and competitive tendering for public services.
Contractors say the process of competitive tendering would be undermined if
European Community regulations protecting the terms of employment of staff
in mergers and acquisitions were held to apply to the contracting-out of
government and council services.
Mr Robin Oakley-Smith, chairman of the Cleaning and Support Services
Association, said yesterday that applying the Transfer of Regulations
(Protection of Employment) rules would make it harder for private firms to
compete effectively. Under Tupe private companies that win public-sector
contracts would have to retain employees on their existing terms of
employment.
'If the regulations were to apply, the process of competition would be
virtually meaningless, as every company would be obliged to maintain the
same cost base,' said Mr Oakley-Smith, whose association represents 160
companies with total annual turnover of Pounds 1.3bn.
His comments reflect a mood of growing frustration among government
contractors over the uncertainties surrounding the regulations, which
implement the EC's 1977 Acquired Rights Directive. Recent decisions of the
European Court of Justice have extended the regulations' scope to cover
contracting out some public services.
Of 20 large and medium-sized contractors contacted this week, five said the
legislation applied to their bids, while seven said it did not, while the
balance insisted that the situation varied on a case by case basis.
Some contractors believe they will be unable to compete effectively with
in-house departments because of the European legislation. All agree that
clarification and consistent advice are needed.
'It seems that the British government just wants to sit back and let the
courts decide - but even the lawyers disagree,' complained one large
contractor, who said he was 'utterly fed up' with the situation.
Some contractors suspect this confusion is deliberate - government
departments or local councils that are opposed to private contractors or
market testing are, they say, using the threat of Tupe to fight
privatisation.
'The real frustration is that we have been flying the flag for the
government with compulsory competitive tendering. But now they've pulled the
plug at the eleventh hour,' said Mr Mike Wardle, joint managing director of
a company which provides sports and leisure facilities for local
authorities.
Mr Wardle's company is, like several other contractors, facing legal action
over its failure to observe Tupe regulations on previous local authority
contracts. However, as he points out, even a decision in the British courts
will not necessarily resolve the issue.
'The annoying thing is that if we win in this country, we would still go to
Europe and lose,' he said.
Some businesses in the waste management sector - where terms of employment
often change significantly under private management - believe Tupe could
kill their business. 'If we are obliged to offer employment to all the
previous employees we just couldn't be effective against the public sector,'
said one large contractor. This message is echoed by other catering,
cleaning and security groups. However, the majority of companies contacted
said they would still be able to compete with in-house teams even if the
regulations applied.
Specialist and information technology service groups appeared to be least
affected by Tupe.
'We would normally expect to take on most of the workforce anyway,'
commented a specialist defence contractor.
'In IT, you need the existing staff to deliver a service from Day One,' says
Mr Charles Cox, director of Hoskyns, the computing services group.
Mr Nigel Brocklehurst, personnel manager for CFM, a subsidiary of ICL which
provides computer management services for about 25 local authorities, said
the regulations can make transfers simpler: 'If you are transferring more
than about 50 or 100 staff it is a logistical nightmare to transfer them any
other way.'
Mr Brocklehurst admitted there are cost implications. 'You inherit things
like liability for 30 years' service which could be expensive. But you
reflect the cost in your charges to the client.'
Other contractors said inheriting collectively bargained agreements and
'outdated' council working practices was 'irritating'.
Nevertheless, the one issue on which there was unanimity across the sectors
is the need for clarification. As Mr Simon Cox, managing director of ISS
Mediclean, one of the largest health service contractors said: 'What we want
to see is some consistent advice coming out of the government. That's the
most important thing.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS may allow 'captive' insurance companies to become members of Pool
Re, the mutual insurance company they are setting up to provide cover
against terrorist attack. This would avert a potential conflict with
commercial insurance buyers.
Insurers had intended to exclude captives - subsidiaries set up largely to
insure the risks of industrial and commercial companies - from membership.
Risk managers said their exclusion could leave many of Britain's biggest
companies without insurance protection against terrorist attack.
The Association of British Insurers said the issue of how captives should
join would be high on the agenda of Mr Eric Coward, a former Sun Alliance
director who will be Pool Re chief executive.

THE first direct competitor to British Telecommunications and Mercury under
government plans to open up the telecoms market was given the go-ahead
yesterday, Tony Jackson writes.
Ionica, a privately-owned company, has been granted a licence to run a
radio-based system across the country. It aims to take 5 per cent of the
household and small-business market within 10 years. Mr Nigel Playford,
managing director, said: 'We aim to undercut BT across the board.'
Ionica was one of four companies awarded a provisional licence in August.
The others - Millicom, Worldcom and National Network - are still in
discussion with the government. Draft licences were announced yesterday for
a further six companies: Vodafone, Millicom, ScottishPower, Scottish Hydro,
Telecom Electric and City of London Telecommunications.
Ionica's shareholders are Yorkshire Electricity, Northern Electric, Ivory &amp;
Sime, 3i, Robert Fleming, Kingston Communications and Symbionics.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Sterling fails to shed intrinsic weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING'S fall yesterday to a historic low against its trade-weighted index
has again raised concerns about the currency's weakness on the foreign
exchanges.
The pound hit a low during the day of 76.2 against the index, which measures
sterling against a basket of other currencies and which Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, has said he monitors closely. It closed at 76.6, compared
with 77.2 on Monday night. The fall means in effect that the pound is worth
76.6 per cent of its value in 1985.
The currency's return near to the historic low of DM2.3480 was a further
sign of weakness. Mr Mark Brett, a currency economist at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, said he was particularly concerned by the way the pound had fallen
sharply in just two days. 'The pound has an incredibly small resilience,' he
said.
There are several reasons for this intrinsic weakness.
First, UK interest rates are lower than those in most European countries.
Three-month sterling interest rates were yesterday at about 6.25 per cent.
By contrast, three-month French francs were at 11.75 per cent and D-Marks at
8.32 per cent. Investors are also concerned that growing inflation in the UK
will erode the value of sterling assets.
Yesterday's producer-price figures, showing a sharp rise in the cost of
imports due to sterling's devaluation, indicated how quickly inflation is
feeding into the economy now that the pound is nearly 16 per cent below its
value on Black Wednesday - September 16 - last year.
Second, dealers remain uncertain about the direction of the government's
economic policy. The most pessimistic view in the market is that the
government has no clear plan for economic management, and that recent cuts
in interest rates were the product of panic rather than policy. The most
charitable view is that the government is going for economic growth, and
will bring interest rates down further.
Mr Brett says: 'The government has three issues to worry about now: growth,
the fiscal deficit and inflation - and it is worrying about them in that
order.'
That view may explain why dealers were unwilling to set much store by the
government's claim that it would rein in public spending to help reduce a
growing public-sector borrowing requirement.
Mr Mark Austin, Treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'The
view is that it is very easy to make plans to cut expenditure and far more
difficult to carry them out.'
Finally, sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism has
made it the most volatile currency in Europe, offering good returns to
investors willing to play it. 'People have probably won and lost more on the
pound than on any other currency this year so far,' says Mr Jim O'Neill,
head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation.
Forecasts as to where the pound is heading in the short term vary sharply.
Mr O'Neill believes the pound will soon recover on new signs of UK economic
growth.
He believes next week's retail sales figures for January may show a sharp
rise. 'The pound could bottom out at DM2.30, but we should see DM2.50 this
year,' he says.
Mr Brett is more pessimistic: 'Dealers are being paid a big premium to short
the pound and buy one with a higher yield,' he said. In his view the pound
will only be cheap enough to offset the low yield for investors when it has
reached DM2.20.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Railway sell-off plan gives guarantee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL passengers are likely to see few if any changes to train
services when privatisation starts next year, says a government consultation
document to be published this week.
Companies bidding for franchises to take over BR's passenger services will
be bound by contract to BR's 1994 timetable, with only marginal changes in
services to reflect market demand.
Later the Department of Transport foresees a gradual evolution in the
timetables as train schedules change to reflect what customers want.
The consultation paper sets out to fill one of the last big gaps in the
government's rail privatisation plans by setting out the rules for allowing
private-sector train operators on to the tracks. It confirms that companies
winning passenger-service franchises will face limited competition initially
from other operators.
The government hopes to get privatisation off to a good start by making the
franchising process as simple as possible.
Franchise bidders will not be involved in negotiations over services or
track charges. These will be laid down by the franchising director after
negotiations with Railtrack, the proposed state-owned track authority.
Companies will be presented with the contract and asked to bid. The one
bidding the highest price - or requiring the lowest subsidy - will win.
Anyone else wanting to run a passenger or freight train in competition with
the franchisees will have to negotiate their own track fees with Railtrack
based on what they can afford to pay.
In the case of freight, operators who cannot afford to pay at least the
marginal extra costs they impose on the railway may qualify for a new system
of government grants.
The paper notes that all access arrangements are subject to EC law,
reinforcing fears that train operators may bring actions for discrimination
if they feel they are being treated unfairly.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Supervision head quits Bank early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROGER BARNES is to retire early from the post of banking supervision head
at the Bank of England.
Mr Barnes, 55, is five years short of the Bank's normal retirement age. He
will stay in the job for several months.
His 20-year career in banking supervision was marred towards its end by
criticism of his department for its role as supervisor of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, the corrupt bank closed in 1991.
He was accused in Lord Justice Bingham's report into the affair of having 'a
rooted unwillingness to believe ill of BCCI'. That report also said he
showed 'misjudgment' in March 1990 in not reporting allegations of fraud at
BCCI to the Bank's Board of Banking Supervision, which oversees his
department.
The Bank said yesterday, however, that there had been no pressure on Mr
Barnes to retire early. The Bank added that 'he approached the Bank early
last year with a request to retire in the summer of the current year'. His
job is widely regarded as one of the toughest and most thankless in the City
of London.
He will be replaced by Mr Michael Foot, 46, who is head of the Bank's
European division. Mr Foot was described by a colleague as one of the Bank's
'brightest and best'. A banker said he was 'one of Eddie's men', meaning
that he is close to Mr Eddie George, the governor-designate.
Mr Foot has never worked in the supervision department, which monitors the
financial strength and probity of banks operating in the UK.
The Bank also appointed Ms Carol Sergeant, 40, to the new post of deputy
head of banking supervision responsible for monitoring big UK commercial
banks and merchant banks.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Higher import prices hit manufacturing costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES about inflationary pressures intensified yesterday with news that
the sliding pound contributed to a sharp rise in manufacturing costs last
month.
The cost of raw materials and fuels purchased by manufacturers rose by a
seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent in January compared with December, largely
because of higher import prices.
The Central Statistical Office said prices of these items last month were
7.2 per cent higher than a year previously, the highest year-on-year figure
since May 1989.
The year-on-year rise was well above City expectations, and compared with a
figure of a revised 5.4 per cent for the 12 months to December.
It reflected the continuing effects on import prices of the 15 per cent fall
in the pound since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism in
September.
Separately, the CSO said wholesale prices of manufactured products for the
UK market, excluding food, drink and tobacco, rose last month by 2.7 per
cent compared with January 1992.
That was the biggest year-on-year rise since August and reflected companies'
eagerness to increase prices for new-year sales programmes. In December the
year-on-year rise was 2.4 per cent.
The statistics increased expectations that the government's target for
underlying inflation may be breached over the next year. The Treasury wants
to keep the year-on-year increase in the retail prices index, excluding
mortgage costs, at 4 per cent or less.
Including food, drink and tobacco, the prices of which can be affected by
changes in excise duties, the year-on-year rise in wholesale prices of
manufactured products was 3.5 per cent in January, the same as in December.
The rise in manufacturing costs between December and January resulted partly
from increases in the price of UK-produced foods such as milk. Under
European Community arrangements, payments to British farmers are
automatically boosted should the pound fall.
Prices of home-produced foods increased by 1.1 per cent last month compared
with December while prices of imported foods went up 0.2 per cent. In each
case these prices do not allow for seasonal fluctuations.
Fuels excluding petroleum products rose in price over this period by 0.3 per
cent while metals saw a price increase of 0.2 per cent.
Since the pound left the ERM, prices of fuels and materials purchased by
manufacturers have increased by a seasonally adjusted 5.6 per cent. But
these extra cost pressures have been countered by relatively low rises in
wages. Confidence among small to medium-sized companies is improving in
Britain but declining in continental Europe, according to a survey by the 3i
investment group and the Cranfield School of Management.
The survey of 8,000 companies in Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Italy
shows that many UK businesses believe the recession is ending. Businesses in
the other nations are becoming more worried about sales prospects because of
the deterioration in European economies, particularly in Germany.

Sir Colin Marshall, BA's new executive chairman, confirmed in the airline's
staff newspaper that there would be further changes to the airline's
existing management team.
Meanwhile, BA and Virgin are to hold more talks tomorrow to try to reach a
compromise over Virgin's compensation demands for the commercial damage it

at the Bank of England.
Mr Barnes, 55, is five years short of the Bank's normal retirement age. He
will stay in the job for several months.
His 20-year career in banking supervision was marred towards its end by
criticism of his department for its role as supervisor of Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, the corrupt bank closed in 1991.
He was accused in Lord Justice Bingham's report into the affair of having 'a
rooted unwillingness to believe ill of BCCI'. That report also said he
showed 'misjudgment' during March 1990 in not reporting allegations of fraud
at BCCI to the Bank's Board of Banking Supervision, which oversees his
department.
The Bank said yesterday, however, that there had been no pressure on Mr
Barnes to retire early. The Bank added that 'he approached the Bank early
last year with a request to retire in the summer of the current year'.
He is being replaced in a job - widely regarded as one of the toughest and
most thankless in the City of London - by Mr Michael Foot, 46, who is now
head of the Bank's European division.
Mr Foot was described by one of his colleagues as one of the Bank's
'brightest and best'. He was described by a banker as 'one of Eddie's men',
meaning that he is close to Mr Eddie George, the governor-designate.
Mr Foot has never worked in the supervision department, which monitors the
financial strength and probity of banks operating in the UK.
One banker said it was disappointing that the Bank had not used the
opportunity to reform the department by bringing in an outsider to the
supervisory post.
Mr Foot read economics at Cambridge University and Yale in the US. In the
early 1980s he worked in the Bank's market division, which is responsible
for financing government debt.
The Bank also appointed Ms Carol Sergeant, 40, to the new post of deputy
head of banking supervision responsible for monitoring big UK commercial
banks and merchant banks.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Gas complaint figures disputed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas and its regulator were in dispute yesterday over the number of
complaints received from customers last year.
Sir James McKinnon, the director-general of Ofgas, the regulator, said in
his annual report that complaints increased 89 per cent to 1,624. British
Gas said it had no knowledge of more than half those complaints.
The Ofgas annual report said the rise 'tends to confirm the belief that
complaints are on a rising trend generally'.
However, the Gas Consumers' Council, which represents customers, said it had
received 19,281 complaints in 1992 - 13 per cent fewer than the year before.
Mr James Cooper, chairman of the council said: 'The 89 per cent annual
increase says more about Ofgas's public profile than it does about British
Gas's performance.'
British Gas said Ofgas had referred 506 complaints to the company - one
complaint for every 35,000 customers.
But Sir James dismissed these claims as being made by British Gas 'spin
doctors'. Ofgas said that in the nine months to December last year, British
Gas had processed between 17,000 and 18,000 complaints that resulted in
compensation being paid and these would be a tiny fraction of the overall
number of complaints received.
Many complaints were by customers having difficulty paying their bills.
Others complained about difficulty in being connected to the gas main. The
number of disconnections for non-payment of bills fell to 16,991 last year
from 18,009 the year before.
Sir James said he was looking carefully at the 'flimsy evidence' provided by
British Gas in support of the price freeze it announced on Monday. But he
said his reading of the index that governs prices showed no room for a rise
as the company claimed.
He said he was pushing British Gas to provide competitors with terms for
transporting interruptible gas supplies. Interruptible gas is the cheapest
supply available to industrial users - the supply can be cut off during
times of peak demand.
No rivals have entered the market yet, although one company tried to
negotiate terms for transporting interruptible gas along British Gas's
pipelines. British Gas has not provided terms. Sir James said: 'It would be
regrettable if Ofgas had to have recourse to its statutory powers before
British Gas honoured its earlier agreement to do so.'
Competitors supply 20 per cent of the overall industrial market and British
Gas will not be able to fulfil its commitment to the Office of Fair Trading
to halve its share of the market by 1995 without opening up the
interruptible sector.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Expo businesses attack DTI over Seville service: The
Department of Trade and Industry is under fire from businessmen and
politicians for alleged mismanagement of the British pavilion at Expo 92,
the international fair held last year in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The building, paid for with about Pounds 20m of public money, was hailed at
the time by Mr Peter Lilley, trade secretary, as 'a showpiece of British
imagination and flair, Britain at its most innovative and entertaining
best'.
But four months after Expo closed it lies empty while the DTI finds itself
embroiled in a controversy which includes:
Liquidation of a retailing company contracted by the DTI to run the pavilion
shop and fly the flag with an assortment of British products supplied by
dozens of leading UK companies. The company, Joanna Bickerton Associates,
has debts of nearly Pounds 500,000.
Freezing of a Spanish bank account opened by the DTI on behalf of JBA,
containing an undisclosed amount of money.
A possible lawsuit against the DTI. KPMG Peat Marwick, JBA's liquidators,
are taking advice on whether there was direct legal involvement by the DTI
in the JBA trading operation, which went into receivership last August, and
whether a successful claim can be made against the DTI on behalf of
creditors.
Separate legal action being considered by at least two other creditors
against the DTI.
Demolition of the award-winning pavilion possibly by the end of March unless
a buyer is found.
The pavilion, the size of Westminster Abbey, was designed by Nicholas
Grimshaw, built by Trafalgar House and won a 1992 British Construction
Industry prize. The total cost of construction and appearing at Expo was
Pounds 25m, about Pounds 5m from commercial sponsorship, the rest from the
government, mainly the DTI.
One of Joanna Bickerton Associates' creditors, HHL Publishing, which
supplied magazines and books to the pavilion, is taking legal advice on how
to recover Pounds 240,000 owed by the company.
Mr Steve Pae, HHL finance director, said: 'We believe that a lot of the
information that was provided to us by the DTI when we went in for tender
was misleading. There is also a question over whether the DTI was acting as
a 'shadow director' of JBA during the Expo,' effectively helping to run some
aspects of the company.
A second creditor, Farrow and Humphreys, a leading UK manufacturer of
toiletries, is owed Pounds 7,000 for goods delivered to Expo but never paid
for. Mr Ron Humphreys, Farrow and Humphreys managing director, said he is
considering legal action to recover money held in an Spanish bank account
opened for JBA in the DTI's name, which he has had frozen under a court
order.
He does not yet know how much is in the account, but the DTI has admitted
that at least some of the money is from sales of goods in the Expo shop run
by JBA, and represents money owed to suppliers.
Mr Humphreys has written to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, strongly criticising his department's handling of the Expo. 'As
one of the . . . exporting companies damaged by the affair, our cash
resources and the confidence of our bankers has been badly dented, thereby
reducing - not enhancing - our export drive, not to mention our enthusiasm
and sense of national pride.'
Mr Richard Bickerton, a JBA director said: 'I hold the DTI completely
responsible for providing us with market research (on the projected number
of visitors to the UK pavilion) which proved to be grossly inaccurate . . .
They've not only messed us up, but also a number of very good British
companies of a variety of sizes.'
KPMG Peat Marwick have confirmed that Mr Bickerton owned a building company,
GOH Bickerton and Sons, which went into receivership two years before the
Expo fair. The DTI has told the FT that that was not a retailing company.
JBA was picked as sole British concessionaire for Seville on the basis of
the company's past good record in running shops similar to those at Expo,
the DTI said.
The DTI forecast of visitors, on which the retailing contract was based,
said 2.75m people would visit the pavilion during Expo, which ran from April
to October. JBA said Expo receipts show the true figure was nearer 1.5m.
More than 50 organisations supplied the British pavilion through JBA and all
are owed money. They include Dartington Crystal, Royal Doulton (part of
Pearson, which owns the Financial Times), the BBC World Service, Marks and
Spencer and Highland Spring. The BBC confirmed that it had registered a
claim with JBA's liquidators. Royal Doulton and M and S had no comment.
Highland Spring said: 'We are owed money . . . we are waiting to see what
the DTI has to say.'
The DTI said that it has made some ex gratia payments covering royalties
which companies were made to pay to JBA before Expo got under way. Advance
royalty payments were stipulated by the Expo authorities.
The DTI said the ex gratia payments did not constitute any admission of
liability and that it considers any other outstanding sums to be commercial
debts for which the department cannot be held responsible.
Ms Rosalind Cole, the DTI's 'project manager, Expo 92 Unit' was unavailable
for comment. Sir John Ure, a former British ambassador and UK
'commissioner-general for Expo' - described by the DTI as the 'figurehead'
for the fair, said when it closed: 'Our main objectives - to project Britain
as an outward looking, technologically advanced, friendly nation . . . have
been met.' Sir John has since retired.
Mr Eric Dancer, managing director of Dartington Crystal, which has a claim
of Pounds 40,000 against JBA said: 'I think British industry should think
very seriously about participating in any future trade show organised by the
DTI. The DTI has let the side down very badly.'
The DTI is also facing criticism from a different quarter. Conserve, a Tory
party pressure group set up three years ago by Sir David Trippier, then
minister of the environment to promote environmental issues, has accused the
DTI of going against the 'national interest' in delaying a decision on the
future of the British pavilion. Conserve trustees include Lord Forte and
Lord Palumbo.
Another Conserve director, Prof Paul Cook, a scientific adviser to the
Department of the Environment, suggested moving the pavilion to Regent's
Park in London under the auspices of the British Science and Technology
Trust, of which he is president. Trustees include Baroness Thatcher.
In a letter sent on behalf of Conserve to the political office at 10 Downing
Street and to Mr David MacLean, environment minister, Lady Olga Maitland MP
said: 'Bearing in mind there is no question of financial input from the
government, it would be vital for the scheme's success to have the
government's unqualified blessing. This will provide the lever to raise the
necessary funds.' The proposal was forwarded to the DTI which has never
responded. Prof Cook said: 'The DTI has handled our proposal atrociously . .
. at least they should have the decency to say one thing or the other.
Taxpayers are geting nothing out of Expo.'
The DTI said some proposals had been turned down on financial or
construction grounds. Advised by property agents Healey &amp; Baker, the DTI is
in 'final negotiations' with an interested company.
It is understood that the DTI has been in discussions with a businessman, Mr
Sharad Patel, who wants to move the pavilion to the UK as headquarters of a
new media satellite station. The DTI has been offered less than Pounds 1m
for the pavilion which would take at least six months to be removed.
Under rules agreed by all participating countries, the five-storey British
building may be knocked down if the DTI fails to dispose of it by the end of
March. Alternatively the DTI will have to start paying rent to the Spanish
authorities.
Ms Ines Alba from Cartuja 93, the government agency running the former Expo
site, said: 'We calculate that the delay is going to cost the British
government another Pounds 65,000.'
The DTI rejected charges of mismanagement and defended its Expo record: 'It
was an opportunity to show the rest of the world what Britain could do, the
Best of Britain.'

FT  10 FEB 93 / White House staff cut by 25%: Clinton carries out pledge to
ensure government makes do with less
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton fulfilled a campaign promise yesterday by announcing
a 25 per cent reduction in the White House staff, proclaiming that
'government must do more and make do with less'.
The cuts, to take effect by October 1, the start of the next fiscal year,
will reduce the number of those in the office of the president to 1,044 from
the 1,394 on the payroll at the end of the Bush administration.
Estimated savings, including salary cuts of 6-10 per cent and the
elimination of other perks such as unlimited newspaper subscriptions, are
put at about Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) a year. Other departments and
agencies are expected to announce cost savings as part of Mr Clinton's
broader goal of eliminating 100,000 federal jobs out of about 3m.
Announcing the cuts, Mr Clinton said: 'This is one of the few times in
history that any president has actually shrunk the size of the White House
staff'. It would lead to 'leaner, more effective government'.
Mr Mack McLarty, the White House chief of staff, said the president would
make do with 10 per cent fewer senior aides. He added that the reductions
were designed to send 'a strong message' to other departments and to
Congress that sacrifices would have to be made in the interests of cutting
the federal deficit.
Exempt from the cuts announced yesterday are staff at the Office of
Management and Budget and the trade representative, who together employ
about 800 people. Though traditionally part of the White House structure,
the heads of both enjoy cabinet rank and will, therefore, have to come up
with economies similar to other departments.
Actual redundancies will be minimised. Nearly 300 of the existing White
House staff are career civil servants on secondment from other agencies and
will return to their departments. Hardest hit is the drug policy office,
mostly filled with political appointees, which will come down in size to 25
people against 146 under President Bush. However its chief, when appointed,
will be elevated to cabinet rank, Mr McLarty said.
Among other symbolic changes, henceforth only three senior aides - the chief
of staff and the national security adviser and his deputy - will be
automatically entitled to use White House chauffeured limousines.

FT  10 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Detroit car makers avoid collision - Nancy
Dunne sees US anti-dumping cases dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Big Three US car makers yesterday backed away from their threat to file
dumping cases against Japanese car companies but said they would continue to
'monitor the situation'.
While Detroit was announcing this decision, the Association of International
Automobile Dealers was interviewing lawyers to explore legal options to
counter the threat of protectionist moves against the US industry. However,
Mr Philip Hutchinson, association president, said the industry group, which
represents 17 foreign producers, would probably now defer its own legal
action.
'There is a silver lining in all this - particularly for the consumer,' Mr
Hutchinson said.
Chrysler, Ford and General Motors issued a formal statement saying they
wanted to 'give the Clinton administration the opportunity to develop its
position on trade and jobs'. This would 'bring broader results in the near
term than proceeding with a dumping suit at this time'.
Meanwhile they will share 'the compelling data we have developed in our
analysis of dumping with senior members of the administration'.
The Big Three had several reasons to refrain from filing dumping cases. The
administration is believed to have discouraged the complaints; it is already
battling a protectionist image, incurred by the imposition of duties on the
steel cases and proposed sanctions against the EC in a government
procurement dispute.
There are widespread fears in the industry that after the disastrous Big
Three trade mission to Japan last January with President George Bush, the
dumping action would just bring more bad publicity. The companies could find
themselves denigrated as 'wimps' or poor losers by their critics and the
public alike.
This would come at a time when Detroit's reputation for quality is improving
and it is benefiting from the end of the recession and growing demand.
Rebates, given as a lure to car shoppers, have begun to decline, and
Chrysler has had a profitable year and General Motors could have its first
for several years.
US trade officials say there was no certainty that the Big Three could prove
dumping had occurred and had injured the US industry. While US car companies
have been slashing their prices to gain market share, Japanese car prices
have been rising.
All the companies are so linked internationally that the US manufacturers
may well be shooting themselves in the foot if they seek government action
against their rivals. After all, one out of 10 car imports is now brought
into the US by Detroit.
GM has supply and technology arrangements with Honda and Isuzu, a joint
venture with Nissan, market distribution arrangements with Renault and Saab
and a manufacturing and assembly relationship with Volvo.
'The question is: 'Who is the US industry?'' said Mr Michael Coursey, a
Washington trade lawyer. 'Toyota? Nissan? Honda? At the end of the day, it
might not matter.'
US trade lawyers say the foreign manufacturers in the US have a number of
legal options against the dumping cases. They can bring an anti-trust action
if they can prove the American industry is acting in collusion to raise
prices.
Foreign-owned companies which manufacture in the US could seek legal
standing as US producers in order to file dumping cases against the cars
brought in by the Big Three.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Bill and Al on the road again: Away from Washington, out
among the voters, the issue is still the economy - and it is picking up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<TEXT>
BILL Clinton and Al Gore begin another campaign today, on their natural
turf. The president is off to Detroit and the vice-president to Ontario,
California, to appear in televised 'town meetings', fielding questions from
citizens, not the media.
Their goal is quite simple: to convince a wider audience that this is a
young administration still firmly on track, which is not necessarily the
prevalent impression inside the hypercritical and media-dominated capital.
They will probably welcome the change of scenery in their first escape from
Washington since the inauguration.
But, even as they leave, there are changes in Washington itself which
indicate some adjustment by the president to the capital's political
realities. Back on board in the White House, albeit in informal consulting
capacities, are Mr James Carville, Mr Paul Begala and Ms Mandy Grunwald,
three of the key political strategists behind Mr Clinton's skilful and
disciplined election campaign.
Implicit in their return, which may be no more than temporary, is the
recognition that the administration has had an uncertain political
beginning, marked by the double failure to find a new attorney general and
the early controversy over Mr Clinton's determination to end the ban on
homosexuals in the military.
The withdrawal, for 'nannygate' reasons, of Judge Kimba Wood from
consideration to run the Justice Department seems a more grievous item of
White House mismanagement than that of the aborted nomination of Ms Zoe
Baird.
Judge Wood has acknowledged in a letter to the New York Times that the
newspaper's initial accounts of her exchanges with the White House -
obviously, though anonymously, provided by her journalist husband Mr Michael
Kramer - were partly inaccurate and that she may, indeed, not have been
crystal clear in what she said. But there is no gainsaying that Mr Clinton's
aides were ill-advised in leaking that she was at the top of the short list
to be attorney general.
The net result is that, for the moment at least, the administration finds
itself fending off outraged criticism (not only from women's groups and talk
show hosts) that the president is applying a double standard to men and
women appointees and is running scared of public opinion.
Now, it appears all nominees for positions requiring Senate confirmation,
about 1,100, will be obliged to confirm that they have always obeyed the law
in hiring domestic help, a criterion not exactly germane to their abilities
to do the job. Worse, it may well rule out of consideration a lot of talent.
Finger-pointing for this firestorm is under way. Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton,
already a target because of her patent power and influence, is being blamed
for her insistence on finding a woman for the justice department. Other
aides, like Mr 'Mack' McLarty, the White House chief of staff, Mr Bernard
Nussbaum, the president's legal counsel, and Mr George Stephanopoulos, the
communications director, are also being charged with lack of political nous.
Similar accusations of loose talk surround the formation of economic policy.
Mr Stephanopoulos has defensively blamed unauthorised leaks for the number
of kites being flown around town - on social security and energy taxes and
on the size of any planned stimulus. The impression gleaned is that whenever
one has been shot down - as in the mooted freezing of the indexation of
pensions - the administration has caved in to powerful special interests.
The Kimba Wood fiasco last Friday interrupted what had been a good week for
Mr Clinton. The passage of the family leave bill could be portrayed as early
evidence that Washington legislative 'gridlock' was over. There had been a
series of presidential consultations with Congress and with the nation's
governors that spoke of policy innovation and new co-operation.
At least these passing domestic passions have taken some of the heat off
foreign policy. This may come as little consolation to Mr Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen, the Bosnian negotiators, who are convinced that the prospect of
US assistance is the main reason why the Bosnian Moslems have not agreed to
their peace plan, but it has bought some time for the administration to make
up its own mind.
More generally, as Mr Jim Hoagland perceptively wrote in the Washington Post
yesterday, it is becoming increasingly clear that Mr Warren Christopher's
role as secretary of state is 'to keep Clinton out of trouble abroad in the
opening phase of his presidency'. In the Middle East, Bosnia, Somalia and
Haiti, 'quick fixes and policy reviews are the order of the day.'
The compromise agreement negotiated by Mr Christopher with Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
Israel's prime minister, over the Palestinian deportees was a quick fix,
getting the US off the potentially embarrassing hook of being forced to veto
a UN Security Council resolution against Israel. His trip to the region next
week equally is designed to buy some more time.
Such delay does not seem to suit the European Community, agitated over trade
policy, and Japan, anxious because it seems to have no friends in the
Clinton court. This week's visits to Washington by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC
trade commissioner, and Mr Michio Watanabe, the Japanese foreign minister,
may not be as fruitful as either would like.
But it is a fair bet that in Michigan and California tonight foreign policy
will not intrude much on Mr Clinton and Mr Gore. Their dialogues with the
people, in the preferred medium of the moment, are going to be about what
brought them into office, neatly summed up in the placard Mr Carville hung
on the Little Rock election war-room; 'the economy, stupid'. The only
difference now is that it is getting better.

BRAZIL yesterday moved into the space age with the successful launch of its
first satellite.
The SCD-1, developed entirely in Brazil, was launched from the Kennedy Space
Centre at Cape Canaveral in Florida yesterday morning - the culmination of a
Dollars 150m (Pounds 99.3m) project begun in 1979. In recent years the
programme has suffered long delays caused by the perilous state of Brazilian
government finances.
Orbiting 750km above earth, the satellite will be used for collecting
meteorological and environmental data about the Amazon rainforest. The data
will be transmitted to the Brazilian space institute (INPE) for monitoring
forest fires and the concentration of carbon monoxide and dioxide in the
atmosphere. Landsat, the American satellite used for capturing images does
not provide such detail.
Mr Pawal Rosenveld, head of satellite monitoring at INPE, said yesterday:
'This is a technological and political success as it puts Brazil in the club
of countries which have the knowhow for satellite manufacture.'
The satellite was launched using the Pegasus rocket made by the American
Orbital Science Corporation. A second Brazilian-made satellite SCD-2 is
planned to be launched at the end of this year with a Brazilian made rocket.

<TEXT>
MR Yoshiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, will try to defuse
mounting trade tension with the US when he meets Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
treasury secretary in Washington at the weekend. Mr Hayashi is expected to
relay Tokyo's objection to US proposals to raise tariffs on minivans and
multi-purpose vehicles from 2.5 to 25 per cent.
Mr Yoshiro Mori, international trade and industry minister, yesterday urged
the US to act sensibly in dealing with the proposed tariff increase, saying
he would be willing to travel to the US ahead of Premier Kiichi Miyazawa, to
discuss trade issues including the minivan tariffs.
Mr Mori's trade minister's initiative comes as Tokyo also prepares for a
three-day visit to the US by Mr Michio Watanabe, deputy prime minister and
foreign minister, starting tomorrow. Mr Watanabe is expected to focus on
political issues, but discussions between Mr Hayashi and Mr Bentsen are set
to touch on trade, including Japan's growing surplus with the US and efforts
to conclude the Gatt Uruguay Round.
Japan is increasingly concerned about Washington's trade stance. As well as
the minivan issue, the Japanese are worried they are being pushed into
bilateral talks on matters they believe are better dealt with through a
multilateral forum such as Gatt, including the opening of Japan's rice
market. Calls are increasing in the US to make this a bilateral issue. Japan
also believes preliminary anti-dumping duties imposed on Japanese steel
imports by the US Commerce Department undermine efforts to work towards fair
trade in steel.
Japan's Iron and Steel Federation yesterday said it had sent a position
paper to US government and congressional leaders seeking their support in
the anti-dumping action, and stressing the importance of the multilateral
steel agreement.
Friction is growing over landing rights, after the US Transport Department
said it might retaliate against Japanese airlines, after Tokyo decided not
to allow United Airlines to extend its New York-Tokyo flights to Sydney.

VIETNAM'S busiest airport is to have a modern air traffic control system

yesterday, Reuter reports from Hanoi.
The company said Vietnam's state carrier, Vietnam Airlines, had chosen it to

The company, which signed another contract with Vietnam Airlines in August
to supply landing communications systems for Ho Chi Minh City Left:
President Francois Mitterrand is greeted by Vietnamese foreign minister
Nguyen Manh Cam (right) as he arrives at Hanoi airport
and the central town of Danang, said it had also received government
approval to open an office in Vietnam.
The news came hours after the arrival in Hanoi of French President Francois
Mitterrand.
Mr Mitterrand is the first western head of state to visit Vietnam and is
accompanied by several ministers and leading businessmen.
The French government has been trying to help integrate communist Vietnam -
both economically and politically - into the international community,
especially since the collapse of the Soviet bloc.
That has included pressing the US government to lift its trade embargo
against Hanoi and its virtual block on World Bank and International Monetary
Fund loans for Vietnam.

GENERAL ELECTRIC of the US has signed an agreement giving it access to a
promising new technology that could save the power industry millions of
dollars in fuel costs. The deal between GE and Exergy, based in California,
is the latest effort by power equipment producers to boost market share by
offering utilities more efficient power production.
An exclusive agreement will enable GE to use the 'Kalina cycle' developed by
Dr Alexander Kalina, principal owner of Exergy, as part of its
combined-cycle power systems. These use the exhaust gases from a gas turbine
to power a second, steam, turbine. GE claims its systems are the world's
most efficient.
Three GEC Alsthom offshoots have won orders worth DM387m (Pounds 161m) from

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US was yesterday subjected to a barrage of criticism from trading
partners over its decision last month to impose swingeing anti-dumping
duties on imports of steel from 19 countries, including seven EC member
states.
The issue will be pressed by Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, when
he meets Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Washington tomorrow.
Sir Leon will also be taking up the US threat to shut EC companies out of
bidding for federal contracts, and the continuing standoff in the Uruguay
Round global trade talks.
At a stormy meeting of Gatt's governing council, the US anti-dumping, and
earlier anti-subsidy, duties on steel were variously described as
'unwarranted and unjustified', 'unfair', 'disturbing' and a threat to world
steel trade and the Uruguay Round.
The EC, which said the duties were the latest measure in 'a massive assault
on the world steel market' by the US, has already sought talks with the US
as the first step to a formal Gatt complaint. Brazil, which put the item on
the council agenda, said it too had sought consultations.
Support came for renewed talks on a Multilateral Steel Agreement, which
would phase out steel tariffs in return for elimination of most subsidies.
MSA talks broke down last spring but are scheduled to begin afresh later
this month.
Gatt members were angry that the anti-dumping duties, provisional until the
US International Trade Commission rules on whether dumping has injured US
producers, relate to imports already covered by voluntary restraint
arrangements. Over 80 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits were filed by US
steel makers weeks after the 10-year-old VRAs expired after March 1992.
Gatt's council yesterday approved membership terms for the Czech and Slovak
republics, which separated at the end of last year, and granted Azerbaijan,
the former Soviet republic, observer status. Swaziland has become Gatt's
106th member.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE VENEZUELAN government, in an effort to reactivate its stalled
privatisation programme, is focusing its attention on selling off four
electric power companies this year.
Mr Julian Villalba, head of Venezuela's privatisation programme, said this
week the government hoped to obtain as much as Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 920m)
this year by selling its shares in Planta Centro, a large electric
generating facility, and Enelven and Enelbar, two regional power generation
and distribution companies.
The administration also has plans to sell the state-owned electric company
that serves the resort island of Margarita.
The administration of President Carlos Andres Perez obtained over Dollars
2bn from privatisation in 1991, but saw sales of state assets decline
steeply last year, when rebellious military units staged two attempted coups
d'etat.
The government, eager to obtain money from privatisation to help cover a
large fiscal deficit projected for this year, may find it hard to sell
important state-owned assets.
Venezuelans are scheduled to elect a new president and national congress
next December, and it is still not clear if the next government will pursue
the unpopular economic reforms initiated by Mr Perez in 1989.
The outlook for possible investors in Venezuela's electric power sector
improved late last year after the government approved a series of staggered
increases in residential and commercial power rates scheduled to continue
after a new administration takes office in 1994.
Aside from the electric power companies, the government also hopes to sell
other state-owned assets this year, including an airline, horseracing
tracks, hotels, sugar mills and perhaps some of its remaining shares in the
national telecommunications company, CANV.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, yesterday launched an
election campaign package, promising to cut the company tax rate from 39 per
cent to 33 per cent.
He also offered a 10 per cent investment allowance for purchases of plant
and equipment by small and medium businesses. And for working women, Mr
Keating proposed a 30 per cent cash rebate, claimable every week, for
work-related child care.
Mr Keating hopes the business incentives will encourage private investment
and help cut unemployment. But he is also targeting his weakest electoral
spots: business and women voters.
The company tax cuts will put a further strain on the government budget.
Mr Keating's 95-page package includes a revised forecast for the 1992-1993
budget deficit, which is now expected to rise to ADollars 15.9bn (Pounds
7bn) from the previous forecast of ADollars 13.5bn. The expected rate of
economic growth has also been scaled down from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent.
Mr Keating said the package would add ADollars 692m to the 1993-1994 budget
and ADollars 387m in 1996-1997. He proposes to fund the package by selling a
further 19 per cent of the government's stake in Commonwealth Bank. This
would earn the government ADollars 1bn but its total holding would fall from
70 per cent to 51 per cent.
He also proposes to bring forward the collection of company taxes. With a
new set of incentives, Mr Keating hopes to woo a large section of the
business community who openly support the tax and industrial relations
policies proposed by the coalition of the conservative Liberal and National
parties.
The conservative opposition, led by Mr John Hewson, is campaigning on a new
goods and services tax and the abolition of seven business taxes, including
the payroll tax.
Mr Hewson said he did not believe the ruling Labor party could deliver the
promised package. He said the government would not be able to raise the
money, in the same way that it found it difficult to meet the personal tax
cuts promised last year.
Mr Hewson is expected to launch his own election campaign platform in a few
days.
The business community has not been impressed by Mr Keating's bait. Mr Ian
Spicer, head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the
tax breaks alone would not cure unemployment. He said the package overlooked
the problem of industrial relations.
'I don't believe we'll see any marked improvement in employment in the short
term if these are the only initiatives presented by the government,' he
added.
Mr Rob Bastian of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia
said he was aghast at the government's plan to 'claw forward' its collection
of the bulk of business taxes.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Hyundai founder retires as party leader

<TEXT>
MR Chung Ju-yung, the founder of South Korea's Hyundai business group,
yesterday announced his retirement from politics following his recent
indictment for election violations in the December presidential polls.
Mr Chung had appeared demoralised by the weekend indictment, and stayed away
from the United People's party's (UPP) first anniversary celebration on
Monday.
But 'he told me he was at ease now', said his son, Mr Chung Mong-joon, who
is an MP for the UPP.
His sudden departure as chairman of the UPP will probably lead to its
dissolution. UPP officials admitted it was unlikely that Mr Chung would
continue to fund the party from his estimated Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn)
fortune, depriving the group of its main financial source.
'I will no longer engage in politics,' Mr Chung said yesterday in a brief
statement to MPs at the UPP headquarters, which is already being vacated.
'Instead, I will work for the economy.'
Mr Chung, who described Mr Kim Young-sam, the next Korean president, as an
'idiot' during the election, also apologised for criticising his opponents.
'I should have regarded them as partners and praised them.'
He gave no indication if and when he would give up his parliamentary seat,
although he is still expected to leave the National Assembly shortly.
'Chairman Chung was already losing interest in politics even before the
indictment because he was defeated for president, which was his main goal,'
explained a senior UPP official.
'He couldn't accept remaining in politics if it only meant being a
legislator in the National Assembly.'
Mr Chung finished third in the presidential election, while the UPP is the
third biggest party in the National Assembly, holding 11 per cent of its
seats, following parliamentary elections last March.
If the UPP collapses, most of its MPs would become independent members or
join either the ruling Democratic Liberal party or the main opposition
Democratic party.
Mr Chung was indicted on Saturday on charges of receiving more than Dollars
60m in illegal campaign funds from Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), his
group's shipbuilding unit. He claims the money came from the sale of shares
in HHI.
Prosecutors said they would continue legal proceedings against Mr Chung in
spite of his political retirement.
His departure from politics, however, reduces the chances that the
government will conduct reprisals against Hyundai as it did last year when
Mr Chung formed the UPP to challenge the government's tight control over
business.
The share prices for most of the 19 listed Hyundai companies rose at the
news of Mr Chung's retirement.
Hyundai officials suggest that his future role will be to develop overseas
business by serving as a roving ambassador for the group.
Mr Chung retired as the Hyundai chairman in 1987, although he and his family
retain majority control of the conglomerate, the biggest in Korea.

Talks aimed at rescuing the west African state of Togo from bloodshed and

Co-operation Minister Marcel Debarge said, Reuter reports from Colmar.
He said representatives of hardline President Gnassingbe Eyadema left Colmar
in eastern France during the night, after talks with the country's
pro-democracy movement collapsed. The Franco-German-sponsored meeting had
brought together the country's five leading political groups.
Togo's foreign minister, Mr Ouattara Natchaba, had earlier accused France of
threatening military intervention, and said the army should be given a say
if Togo's problems were to be solved.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Iraq muddies water of Turkey-Syria dam deal: Threats over
Euphates project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRANY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ'S recent threat to take legal action against foreign contractors on a
Turkish dam project was more than just another warning shot across the bows
of Ankara's multi-billion-dollar south-east Anatolian project. The outburst
is seen as an indication of growing concern in Baghdad at the possibility of
a water deal between Turkey and Syria which could leave Iraq high and dry.
Iraq's anxiety follows the recent accord signed in Damascus committing
Turkey and Syria to find a 'final solution' to the allocation of the
Euphrates river this year. Some diplomats in Ankara discount the move as yet
another 'agreement to disagree'. However, for both countries, there seems to
be ample reason to push for a more permanent settlement to this long
riparian dispute.
Ankara's control of the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers, both of which rise
in its central highlands and flow into the Gulf, has long soured relations
with its Arab neighbours. Turkey's irrigation project, known as Gap, has
been the main bone of contention - in particular, its plans to irrigate 1.7m
hectares along the Syrian and Iraqi borders.
Turkey has long resisted calls for a more comprehensive solution, reluctant
to become embroiled in the disputes of Syria and Iraq, which in the
mid-1970s came close to open conflict.
With Iraq's continuing international isolation, any deal with Syria would
undermine the case for an internationally ratified agreement on the water
issue.
Modest progress on the security front helped pave the way for the Damascus
accord, in particular Syria's assurances to curb Turkish Kurd separatists on
its territory.
There was also a technical reason for the meeting. In 1987 Turkey agreed to
guarantee to Syria a discharge of 500 cu m a second where the Euphrates
crosses their border. Under that agreement, Turkey was committed to review
the water allocation, once the reservoir behind the vast Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.6bn) Ataturk dam was filled. That day has arrived.
But more than that, western diplomats say Turkey's decision to push for a
deal is a measure of the desperate financial constraints facing the Gap
project. Hitherto, the World Bank and other donors have refrained from
supporting the project directly because of the outstanding water issue.
According to western officials, only if Turkey solicits international
finance can it afford to invest in the more costly water conserving
equipment, an issue vital for the downstream users. That will only happen if
a solution can be found to the dispute.
Donors now believe the day of financial reckoning is fast approaching. The
Gap has already consumed Dollars 9bn, much of it financed from the state
budget. By next century, when the irrigation infrastructure and the 21 dams
and 19 power plants are in place, the project will have cost a heady Dollars
32bn.
As Turkey prepares to irrigate the first hectares on the Harran plain close
to the Syrian border in May, the need to address the issue has acquired a
new urgency. Turkey will want to reassure the Syrians of continued
co-operation, although the Turks seem unlikely to agree to Syria's demands
to increase the water supply.
Iraq's latest snipe may thus cause a few ruffled feathers for the commercial
banks and export credit agencies now being approached to finance the DM2bn
(Pounds 833m) Birecik project.
The consortium led by Philip Holzmann of Germany has been quick to point out
that there are no plans for irrigation, only hydro-electric generation. In
addition, the Turks argue that Iraq has already given implicit approval to
the project, having signed up to a separate plan linking the power grids of
Turkey and its Arab neighbours: the Birecik plant is the first stage of this
five-country project and would transmit power to the Syrian city of Aleppo.
Iraq's concern over Birecik may still prove premature. Hermes, the German
export credit agency, is understood to have second thoughts about supporting
a project which the Turks seem intent on financing using the more complex
and largely untried technique of Build Operate and Transfer. Under such an
arrangement, the contractor owns and finances the project, recovering its
cost by selling its product, in this case electricity, back to the public
utility. The public outburst from the Iraqis can only further deepen the
misgivings of the lenders.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Japanese employers urged not to cut jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government yesterday underlined the seriousness of the economic
downturn by taking the unusual step of formally asking companies not to shed
labour.
The move shows how worried the authorities have become that there could be a
sharp rise in unemployment as economic growth slows.
The labour ministry's call is the latest in a series of government moves to
modify business responses to the downturn.
Earlier this week, banks were formally asked not to restrict lending to
smaller companies, and financial institutions have been asked not to sell
shares to help to prevent further falls on the Tokyo stock market.
The next few months will test whether the bureaucracy still possesses the
authority it used to have over the private sector to enforce such guidance.
Mr Kunihiko Saito, chief of the labour ministry's employment security
bureau, asked a meeting of business leaders to refrain from cancelling plans
to employ new graduates and retire older workers.
Mr Saito told the group: 'Labour adjustment by such means will create great
worries over employment in the whole of society. We want you to do your
utmost to keep workers employed.' He warned that job losses would undermine
society's trust in companies.
The unemployment rate, which was 2.2 per cent for most of last year, rose to
2.4 per cent in December.
A growing number of comp anies have announced recruitment freezes and plans
to lay off older workers to cut costs and boost profitability. Within the
last week alone Eastman Kodak, the film company, Omron, the electronic goods
maker and Minolta, the camera manufacturer have announced plans to trim
about 4,000 jobs over the next few years.
The weakened state of the economy was spelt out by a clutch of official
statistics.
Bank lending in January grew by just 2.0 per cent, the same rate as the
previous two months. The low growth in bank lending means the Japanese money
supply is likely to continue to contract.
Japan's machine tool orders last year fell by 37.8 per cent on the previous
year to Y710bn (Pounds 3,776m) largely because of a slump in private sector
capital investment. Private sector machinery orders, which have been
fluctuating wildly in recent months, fell by 6.2 per cent in December,
according to figures published by the Economic Planning Agency.
EPA officials said they were extremely cautious about the outlook for
machinery orders.
Meanwhile the fall in Tokyo land prices is accelerating, according to a
National Land Agency survey. In the final three months of last year land
prices in central and north-eastern Tokyo fell at 25 per cent a year, after
falling by 20 per cent in the previous quarter.
The land price fall is one factor behind a marked pick-up in sales of
cheaper condominiums in Tokyo and Osaka, which suggests that some parts of
the property market are beginning to recover strongly. The Real Estate
Economy Institute, a private sector research group, said the number of
condominiums put on sale in the Tokyo area last month rose by 24 per cent to
1,969 compared with the same month last year.
About 77 per cent of the condominiums were contracted for sale, a marked
increase on last year. But this was mainly because the average condominium
price had fallen by 25 per cent to Y44m.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Now Zambia points way to fiscal rectitude in adversity: A
hoped-for economic example to follow a multi-party political one
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING provided a rare African example of successful transition from
one-party rule to multi-party politics, Zambia may be offering another
important pointer for the continent: how to balance the budget in adversity.
Describing the country's inflation record - 207 per cent in the year to
December - as 'totally unsatisfactory', Mr Emmanuel Kasonde, finance
minister, last week unveiled a disinflationary, balanced budget.
If he can make it stick, it will go a long way towards promoting sustained
recovery in an economy sapped by mismanagement and weak prices for its main
export, copper.
Failure, however, will reinforce the view that, without additional
resources, economic recovery is beyond the reach of even the
best-intentioned African governments. It will also undermine the government
of President Frederick Chiluba, which swept to victory in the elections in
October 1991.
The year has not started well. After severe drought last year, maize
production should recover strongly from the 1992 crop of only 5.2m bags (of
90 kg), compared to 12.2m in 1991. But the mid-January dry spell has raised
fears of another mediocre season.
Meanwhile, the copper price, which averaged 103.5 US cents a lb last year,
seems set to stagnate for much of 1993. Since the mineral accounts for
around 90 per cent of export earnings, this suggests that any improvement in
the balance of payments from last year's Dollars 94m current account deficit
is dependent on reduced food imports and lower debt-service payments.
Mr Kasonde's target of an annual inflation rate of 10 per cent by December
looks out of reach, with inflation still running at an annualised 200 per
cent in the final quarter of 1992 - though well down on the annualised 350
per cent recorded in the first quarter.
Money supply also doubled during 1992, with government borrowing from the
Bank of Zambia and the commercial banks, up by 81 per cent, accounting for
56 per cent of the increase in bank lending.
If Mr Kasonde gets his way this will change drastically during 1993. 'The
budget,' he told MPs, 'has been framed so that financing comes first;
expenditure is the residual.'
The Bank of Zambia will simply say no when government ministries seek to
overspend. Extra revenues that might arise from 'higher than programmed
inflation' will not be spent. Treasury bill borrowings will be used to roll
over existing debt, while government plans to repay 'much of its
outstanding' domestic commercial bank debt.
The Zambian track record suggests that they mean what they say. Last year,
despite a 2.8 per cent fall in real GDP, a 39.3 per cent decline in farm
output and inflation of more than 200 per cent, the government was able to
cut the budget deficit from the 7.4 per cent of GDP inherited from the
Kaunda administration in 1991, to only 2.2 per cent, or 0.3 per cent if
drought-related spending is omitted.
This year, the spending target will rise 80 per cent to K231bn (Dollars
630m).
A debt-relief agreement last July with the Paris Club of official creditors,
whereby debt-service costs were reduced by some Dollars 270m a year in the
three years to 1995, will contribute substantially towards budgetary
savings.
But some bitter political battles are looming. Mr Kasonde has a fight on his
hands on public spending, on wage increases, and over civil service
retrenchment - with some analysts suggesting that 50,000 people, or half the
civil service, will have to be laid off. He hopes that effective tax cuts,
achieved by raising thresholds substantially and broadening the three income
tax bands (of 15 per cent, 25 per cent and an unchanged top rate of 35 per
cent), will alleviate pressure for wage rises. This too is optimistic.
However, a reduced rate of corporate tax, the promised abolition of exchange
controls, inherited at independence 29 years ago, and the assertion that
government no longer has a role to play in fixing the exchange rate, are all
grist to the private enterprise mill.
Some perspective can be gained too from a comparison with Zambia's far more
industrialised and prosperous neighbour Zimbabwe, which like Zambia suffered
from severe drought in 1991-1992 and which is also undergoing structural
reform, albeit in a far more leisurely manner.
But these impressive achievements and worthy intentions will prove
inadequate to the task of rebuilding the economy unless private sector
investment recovers strongly. That is not going to happen without
substantial public sector investment in the infrastructure, especially
transport, education and training.
These are long-haul strategies which means that the Zambian recovery, when
it comes, will be slow.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Singapore seeks to be more competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE is introducing a 3 per cent goods and services tax (GST) and
promised significant cuts in corporate and personal taxes in a budget at the
end of this month.
Mr Richard Hu, minister of finance, said it was vital that Singapore reduce
its direct taxes in order to maintain its long-term competitiveness. It was
also important for Singapore to broaden its tax base.
'The whole idea is to make us more competitive,' said Mr Hu. 'The government
does not need the additional revenues. . . our fiscal position is very
healthy.' Singapore runs a budget surplus and, at 47 per cent of GDP, has
one of the highest savings rates in the world. It has foreign exchange
reserves officially put at Dollars 40bn.
The government hopes that by introducing its new tax regime, with lower
direct taxes, Singaporeans will be encouraged to invest overseas. Government
leaders have bemoaned the lack of Singaporean entrepreneurs willing to look
at business opportunities abroad, particularly in China.
The government said the lower corporate taxes would partially offset
Singapore's high labour and land costs.
It said the GST would be held at 3 per cent for at least five years after
its introduction in April 1994.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin said yesterday he was prepared to drop plans for a
controversial referendum on whether the president or parliament should rule
Russia, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
After Mr Valery Zorkin, the chairman of the Constitutional Court, and heads
of republics within the Russian Federation joined opposition to the poll, Mr
Yeltsin said: 'Let us proclaim 1993 the year of a moratorium on all
political fist-fighting and other major political events. Let us deal with
the economy. This is the main thing that can ruin us.'
The referendum plan was born of a compromise at last December's Congress of
People's Deputies between the president and parliament to try to break
Russia's constitutional impasse. But Mr Yeltsin has become concerned that
the referendum may not turn out to be such a simple solution.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Business as usual for Euro-free Swiss: Fears of splendid
mountain isolation proved unfounded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THOSE who believe that markets are always right, the Swiss made a
brilliant decision last December in rejecting a plan to move closer to the
European Community.
Since the no-vote in the referendum on joining the European Economic Area
(EEA), and contrary to the expectations of most analysts, the stock market
has risen more than 10 per cent. Swiss interest rates have fallen by more
than a point, the Swiss franc is firm and flight capital is flooding back
into the country.
Even shares of middle-sized, export-intensive machinery companies, which
many said would be hard hit if the country excluded itself from the European
single market, have performed well.
Government and business leaders remain worried about the dangers of
isolation. Swiss scientists have already received letters from Brussels
advising them that they must abandon their seats on European project
planning committees. Swissair, the national airline, is suddenly
contemplating mergers with EEA-based airlines to ensure it retains fair
access to airports in EC cities. And exporters fear that customs officials
in EC countries will deliberately entangle incoming Swiss goods in red tape.
But for the moment, the predominant sentiment in most quarters appears to be
a puzzled relief that the negative vote has not yet brought any negative
consequences.
Apart from economic worries, there was, in the immediate aftermath of the
vote, concern about the sharp divide it exposed between French-speaking
Swiss, who massively supported the EAA, and German and Italian speakers, who
opposed it.
There were comical scenes in parliament in December with anxious German
speakers trying to assuage their fellow citizens by deliberately speaking
stilted French. The federal government quickly promised more motorway
construction in Romandy and civic leaders in Lucerne launched a 'Salut les
Romands' programme, inviting French Swiss to stay in the city's hotels for
half price.
While the linguistic cleavage remains worrying, it has been softened
somewhat by closer analysis of the voting, revealing that the German and
Italian Swiss were not giving vent to any anti-Romand sentiment. It was
rather a case of still not wanting to get too close to their formerly
belligerent neighbours, Germany and Italy.
There were also important divisions between city and country - all the main
cities in German-speaking Switzerland produced majorities in favour of the
EEA - and between those, such as farmers and merchants, who benefit from
subsidies and other forms of protection from foreign competition, and those
who do not.
Perhaps the surprise, one western diplomat said this week, is that so many
Swiss - only a fraction under 50 per cent - voted in favour of the EEA. A
couple of years ago, the notion that Switzerland should move closer to the
EC would have been overwhelmingly rejected. As recently as 1986, a majority
vetoed a government recommendation that the country join the United Nations.
The relative strength of the pro-European vote is one reason the government
feels it need not jettison its pro-EC integration policy. Mr Adolf Ogi, the
president, has flatly refused the demand of Mr Christoph Blocher, the
charismatic anti-EC leader, that the country's application to join the EC
itself be withdrawn, even though he admits that it is unlikely to be acted
upon for several years.
The government's strategy now is unilaterally to take the steps to bring
Swiss law and practices into harmony with those of the EC that it would have
had to do if it joined the EEA. It hopes that neighbouring countries will
recognise these moves and that Swiss people and exporters will not face
discrimination in EEA countries.
But it is unlikely that the so-called Eurolex package of some 60 measures
will pass intact. Car dealers, construction contractors and scores of other
entrepreneurs who benefit from high levels of protection will fight it all
the way.
Bern will also seek bilateral negotiations with the EC on the most pressing
matters, such as air traffic and some technical trade issues. But Swiss
officials are under no illusions about the difficulties they face. As
representatives of a small country, they have little bargaining power with
the EC. They will not even be able to complain publicly if Brussels is
intransigent for fear of reinforcing anti-EC sentiment among the Swiss
public.
For their part, EC officials have made clear that they are not willing to
negotiate a bespoke EEA just for Switzerland.
On the political front, EEA advocates have already launched petition
campaigns to oblige the government to hold another referendum in the near
future. But even strongly pro-EC political leaders agree that it would be
insulting to the people to stage another referendum quickly, and the result
would probably be counter-productive, not just in Switzerland, but also in
Europe.
'We think that Europe cannot afford any more negative votes,' says Mr Bruno
Spinner, head of the government's integration bureau.
Cynics say that the next vote should not be held until unemployment, already
at post-war record levels, has become much worse and several Swiss companies
have announced plans to shift production to EC countries.
But all this is hypothetical. Swiss financial markets are in fine shape and
economists are beginning to talk about an economic recovery late in the
year.
Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, president of BZ Trust and a former central bank
economist, shrugs off exporters' worries. He points to the remarkable
recovery of the watch industry in the past decade and concludes, 'Swiss
manufacturers always perform well under pressure.'
If he turns out to be right, the need and the desire to move closer to the
EC could recede indefinitely.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Socialists to debate Craxi's future

<TEXT>
MR Bettino Craxi, secretary general of Italy's Socialist party, is under
mounting pressure to step down from the leadership and to support the
election of a successor at tomorrow's extraordinary assembly of the party.
Despite receiving four separate notices from Milan magistrates that he is
under investigation for alleged corruption and illicit funding of the party,
Mr Craxi has insisted on remaining the Socialist secretary general. He has
consistently denied any wrong-doing and accused the magistrates of carrying
out a personalised campaign of denigration.
The special party meeting has been called to consider Mr Craxi's resignation
and elect a new secretary general. But the party has postponed such a
decision on several occasions.
However, his position has been undermined by the arrest of Mr Silvano
Larini, an architect and friend since university days. Mr Larini, who has
been on the run outside Italy for eight months, handed himself over to Milan
magistrates at the Franco-Italian border post of Ventimiglia on Sunday.
Mr Larini has been cited 21 times in documents seeking waiver of
parliamentary immunity for Mr Craxi, and is now said to be co-operating with
magistrates over allegations that he was a major collector of funds for the
Socialists in Milan public works contracts.
Mr Craxi has sought to ensure he holds sway over any potential successor. He
has blocked any suggestion that Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister,
should lead the party.

FT  10 FEB 93 / G7 finance ministers to meet in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCE MINISTERS from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries will
meet in London on February 27 at the invitation of Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor of the exchequer.
The UK Treasury announced yesterday that the meeting, which will also be
attended by G7 central bank governors, would be informal, 'with no
expectation of decisions or initiatives', and that the ministers did not
intend to issue a communique afterwards.
The ministers and governors are expected to discuss how best to boost
activity in the world economy when recovery in the UK is uncertain and the
economic outlook for Japan and continental Europe bleak.
While the G7 has reason to be pleased about signs of recovery in the US,
America's trading partners may express concern about signs of protectionism
in Washington since the Clinton administration took office. Russia's
problems may also be raised.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, has sought a meeting with his
colleagues from Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada before the
next scheduled G7 gathering on April 29 in Washington. He has said he wants
to breathe new life into the group, which recently has tended to be a forum
for bickering rather than international co-operation.
The London meeting will be a first opportunity for Mr Bentsen and Mr Yoshiro
Hayashi, the recently appointed Japanese finance minister, to meet the other
G7 finance ministers.
It is unusual but not unprecedented for the G7 to meet without issuing a
communique. The most recent occasion was in 1989.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Greek-Cypriots feel the effects of economic heat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NICOSIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREEK-CYPRIOT hoteliers are complaining that bookings have fallen sharply
this year, but the island's economic planners admit a sense of relief.
Last year's record tourist season, marked by a 43 per cent jump in arrivals
to just under 2m, pushed up gross domestic product by between 7.5 and 9 per
cent. With tourism contributing about 20 per cent of GDP, a leaner year
should take some steam out of an overheated economy.
'We're already too dependent on tourism,' says one official. 'We reached a
ceiling last year. We don't have the resources - workers, water, beaches -
to cope with more people.'
GDP growth this year should fall below 4 per cent, provided there is no
last-minute flood of bookings. The travel industry claims the Cyprus pound,
pegged to the Ecu since last summer, is too strong to be competitive in the
British package holiday market, the main source of visitors to Cyprus.
The clothing industry, the other main foreign exchange earner, is also in
trouble because of the strong Cyprus pound. Orders from Britain, the largest
customer, are shrinking. One big Greek-Cypriot manufacturer has moved to
Jordan to take advantage of cheaper labour costs.
The island's labour shortage has grown so acute that strict immigration
rules have been relaxed. The workforce increased by about 5 per cent in the
past year, with the arrival of more than 12,000 east European and Asian
workers on short-term contracts at wages well below the Greek-Cypriot
average.
Nonetheless, labour costs have been rising more quickly than the European
average, as Cyprus is still committed to index-linked wage rises. With the
introduction of VAT last year, annual inflation rose to 6.5 per cent, the
highest level for almost a decade.
This year, inflation is projected to drop to 4.5 per cent as the central
bank tightens a credit squeeze. The commercial banks have been threatened
with severe penalties if the practice of letting liquidity drop below
official limits is continued. But the central bank has comparatively little
room for manoeuvre as the government is still unwilling to lift a
45-year-old law, a relic of British colonial days, that puts a 9 per cent
ceiling on interest rates.
Demand is forecast to shrink, after a desperate rush to acquire cars and
household appliances before VAT was imposed. Imports rose by almost 20 per
cent last year, with the current account deficit widening to CPounds 114m
(Pounds 160m), equivalent to 3.5 per cent of GDP.
This feverish prosperity is not matched in the north of the island, where
the Turkish-Cypriots are heavily dependent on aid from Turkey, estimated to
cover about 40 per cent of budget outlays. They have a per capita income
less than a third of the Greek-Cypriot level of around Dollars 12,000.
An independent economist points out that reuniting Cyprus in an arrangement
that would promote economic co-operation with the north would make room for
more tourists and allow Turkish-Cypriots to join the workforce.
But, he adds, without a settlement, the prospects of attracting investment
to help diversify the economy will remain limited.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Brussels tries to forge steel rescue plan: Call to cut
over-capacity upsets Spain but gets cautious welcome elsewhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL, TOM BURNS, ANDREW BAXTER and WILLIAM DAWKINS, Our Foreign
and Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Commissioners yesterday began the sensitive task of preparing a
draft rescue plan for the ailing European steel industry, after getting a
cautiously positive response from steelmakers to a Commission report on
over-capacity.
But the report by Mr Fernand Braun, the EC's 'steel envoy,' immediately ran
into trouble in Spain, where the government's long-standing attempt to
restructure its loss-making, state-owned steel industry is threatened.
Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert,
responsible for competition policy, met senior executives of the EC's
largest steel manufacturers in northern Belgium on Monday night to discuss
the report.
Mr Braun has concluded that steelmakers could cut capacity by up to 25.8m
tonnes in crude steel and 17.9m tonnes in rolled products. '(The
steelmakers) have said the Braun report is very positive and very
constructive, and they confirmed, more or less, the range (of capacity
cuts),' said one senior Commission official yesterday.
Both Mr Bangemann and Mr van Miert insist cuts in capacity are essential if
the industry is to get Community aid for the 50,000 redundancies likely as a
result of restructuring. The Commission must come up with detailed proposals
for a meeting of EC industry ministers on February 25.
In Madrid, the government is shocked that Spain is called on to provide
almost 50 per cent of the proposed overall cuts in rolled flat steel
capacity when it produces just 6 per cent of the Community's output.
As Madrid sees it, Mr Braun's recommendations call for a total capacity cut
of 3m tonnes in flat products, of which the Spanish contribution will be
1.3m tonnes.
Madrid may have only itself to blame, for just under a year ago it
unilaterally forwarded a plan to Brussels that outlined a cut in its steel
output from 6m tonnes a year to 4.5m tonnes. In return Madrid wanted
permission to implement subsidies for a Dollars 5bn restructuring plan.
The Spanish plan ran aground in October when the EC Commission told Madrid
it should either write off more capacity or trim the subsidies.
Meanwhile, steel unions, mainly based in the politically volatile Basque
country, demanded more subsidies for smaller cuts. Mr Braun's report has
made the government's position still more uncomfortable.
Elsewhere, leading European steel companies welcomed the Braun report but
were not prepared to say individually whether they had offered any capacity
cuts.
Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel maker, finds the commission
report 'positive,' according to a group official. 'Now we must follow it
through to the end,' he said.
The French company argues that Commission policing of closures must measure
actual falls in production rather than theoretical cuts in capacity. 'It is
very much up to Brussels to find a means of regulation,' the official said.
British Steel said Monday's meeting with the Commission was 'useful and
positive'. The Commission, it said, was 'clearly cognisant of the problems
facing the industry and intends to take action to facilitate the
restructuring.'

FT  10 FEB 93 / Bosnia peace 'needs 25,000 UN troops'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE international community will have to make an exceptional effort to
ensure that any peace settlement in Bosnia is effectively implemented.
That conclusion emerges from a report to the United Nations Security Council
on the latest negotiations on Bosnia by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary general.
The international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, told the Security
Council their peace package was enforceable, but would require 15,000 to
25,000 UN troops. Some military experts say that is a very conservative
estimate.
Admitting the many past failures of ceasefire and other agreements in the
former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen implied that this was a weakness which needed
further consideration in the mediators' plan. Mr Vance and Lord Owen hope
that problem will be addressed by the US administration in its own proposals
for a peace settlement, due to be announced shortly. Specifically, they want
the US to make a substantial contribution to the peacekeeping forces.
The US is likely to propose modifications to the map dividing Bosnia into
semi-autonomous provinces to give the Moslems more territory, a more robust
relief efforts to overcome the Serb militias' harassment of aid convoys, and
tighter sanctions against Serbia. President Bill Clinton is also reported to
be considering the appointment of a special US envoy to work in co-operation
with the mediators.
The mediators, according to Mr Boutros Ghali's report, have told the warring
parties that an enforceable 'no-fly' ban would be required after a ceasefire
to give teeth to the control of heavy weapons. Aircraft used for enforcing
the air exclusion zone might also be empowered to strike at any heavy
weapons not declared to the UN Protection Force.
The mediators also urged the Security Council to establish awar crimes court
to try people accused of grave breaches of international law in the former
Yugoslavia.
One striking conclusion of the report is that it blames the Bosnian Moslem
government, represented in New York by Mr Haris Silajdzic, the foreign
minister, for refusing to discuss the proposed map during the talks in New
York. This, along with the demand by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb
leader, for referendums on the proposals in the contested areas, were the
main obstacles to an agreement.
It remains to be seen whether the intense pressure on Mr Karadzic during the
past 48 hours by Russia and Serbia to accept the map will bear fruit before
the US proposals are announced. So far, the argument that it is in his
interest to do a deal in advance of the more pro-Moslem stance expected to
be adopted by Washington, has fallen on deaf ears.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Brussels puts the brakes on motorbikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A EUROPEAN Commission draft directive, which effectively dictates to
motorcycle manufacturers the detailed design of their engines, and even the
type and quality of metals they may use for some components, is causing an
outcry throughout the industry and among user groups.
The directive, so detailed that it specifies such engineering parameters as
gasket thicknesses, inlet port design and ignition system operation, is
intended to prevent owners 'tuning' their machines to obtain more power.
But it would have an impact, with as yet unforeseen effects, on the design,
development, marketing and other commercial fortunes of all manufacturers
seeking to sell their machines in the EC.
Motorcycle industry and user groups, now lobbying fiercely against its
adoption, insist that Brussels bureaucrats are exceeding their competence.
Mr Graham Sanderson, spokesman for the British Motorcyclists' Federation,
said: 'It graphically illustrates why so many European citizens are
concerned about the Maastricht treaty and the further ceding of power to the
Commission.'
The required technical specifications for engine manufacture make up an
addendum of six closely-typed pages.
Mr Sanderson's remarks came as the European parliament was resuming the
first reading of another motorcycle-related bill, under which the Commission
is seeking to adopt a directive restricting motorcycles to no more than 100
brake horsepower.
If adopted, this would prohibit the sale in EC markets of the more powerful
machines produced by some European manufacturers, as well as the big
Japanese makers, Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki who dominate the world's
motor cycle markets.
In the case of Triumph, the reborn UK motor cycle manufacturer currently
expecting to produce nearly 7,000 motorcycles this year, five of its eight
models would become illegal within the EC.
The Commission is pushing for the adoption of both directives on the grounds
that they would improve the generally poor safety record of motorcycles and
mopeds.
The 100 brake horsepower directive has already hit opposition in the
European parliament, whose economic and industry policy committee has
already rejected it once. The 'anti-tampering' directive has yet to reach
the parliament but is expected to do so within the next few weeks.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bettino Craxi, secretary general of Italy's Socialist party, is under
mounting pressure to step down from the leadership and to support the
election of a successor at tomorrow's extraordinary assembly of the party.
Despite receiving four separate notices from Milan magistrates that he is
under investigation for alleged corruption and illicit funding of the party,
Mr Craxi has insisted on remaining the Socialist secretary general. He has
consistently denied any wrong-doing and accused the magistrates of carrying
out a personalised campaign of denigration.
The special party meeting has been called to consider Mr Craxi's resignation
and elect a new secretary general. But the party has already postponed such
a decision on several occasions.
However his position has been undermined by the arrest of Mr Silvano Larini,
an architect and friend since university days. Mr Larini, who has been on
the run outside Italy for eight months, handed himself over to Milan
magistrates at the Franco-Italian border post of Ventimiglia on Sunday.
Mr Larini has been cited 21 times in documents seeking waiver of
parliamentary immunity for Mr Craxi, and is now said to be co-operating with
magistrates over allegations that he was a major collector of funds for the
Socialists in Milan public works contracts.
Behind the scenes Mr Craxi has been trying to ensure he holds sway over any
potential successor. He has blocked any suggestion that Mr Claudio Martelli,
the justice minister, should lead the party or hold high office.
The party faces the difficult challenge of finding a new executive with
sufficient credibility to overcome the serious damage inflicted by
allegations of its involvement in kick-backs on contracts. The Socialists'
only solace is that magistrates are widening their investigations towards
Rome, exposing other parties.
Yesterday, Mr Vittorio Sbardella, a powerful local Christian Democrat
politician in Rome, received notice that he was under investigation for
alleged corruption. He is the most senior Rome politician to be linked to
instances of alleged corruption.
In addition, confessions made to Milan magistrates by a former member of the
board of Enel, the state electricity authority, have implicated two
Republican MPs in alleged illicit party funding - Mr Antonio Del Pennino and
Mr Italico Santori. This is embarrassing for the small Republican party and
its leader, Mr Giorgio La Malfa, who has maintained it was outside the
corruption net.
In another development, Mr Aldo Belleli, owner of a prominent contracting
company with overseas interests in oil, was yesterday placed under house
arrest following a charge of alleged corruption.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S single market risks collapse unless the EC holds steady to its goal
of economic and monetary union (Emu), according to Dr Maria Schaumayer,
governor of the central bank of Austria, which hopes to be inside the EC by
1995 after starting accession negotiations last week.
She warned yesterday that European integration 'would be seriously
endangered' if currency speculators got the better of the European Monetary
System's embattled exchange rate mechanism.
It is assumed Austria would join any 'hard core' monetary union based on
Germany, France and Benelux countries, if such a move went ahead.
Dr Schaumayer, addressing the currency conference of the European
Parliamentarians and Industrialists Council in Strasbourg, also criticised
the policy of competitive devaluations being followed by some EC member
states - led by the UK - describing any consequent benefits for export
industries as 'a flash in the pan'. By contrast, she praised the
Franco-German co-operation in defence of the French franc.
The European parliament's monetary affairs committee is also underlining the
threat to the single market, the ERM and Emu from competitive devaluations,
in a report it will present next month.
The report, by Dutch socialist Euro-MP Alman Metten, calls for a big EC
growth package, and urges member states to agree with the US and Japan
'target zones for currency parities of the dollar, yen, Ecu or D-mark.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trade and Industry Department has come under heavy criticism from
British companies who have run up debts because of what they allege is
mismanagement of the British pavilion at Expo 92 last year in Seville,
Spain.
More than 50 companies supplied an assortment of products to Joanna
Bickerton Associates, which has gone into liquidation owing nearly Pounds
500,000 after being contracted by the DTI to run the pavilion shop.
The Expo was billed by the DTI as the world's largest fair and an
opportunity to display the best of Britain's commercial and cultural
achievements.
But four months after the end of Expo, the DTI is embroiled in a controversy
involving at least three possible lawsuits, while the future of the pavilion
is in doubt.
The total cost of construction and appearing at Expo was Pounds 25m, about
Pounds 5m from commercial sponsorship, the rest from the government, mainly
the DTI.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Sterling falls sharply on inflation fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING FELL sharply yesterday on signs that UK inflationary pressures may
be strengthening and on growing international disenchantment about prospects
for recovery in Britain.
Investors from the US, the Middle East and Far East sold pounds for other
currencies, pushing sterling to a record low on its trade-weighted index and
close to its lowest ever level against the D-Mark.
Share prices on the London stock exchange dropped on speculation that the
falling pound might limit the government's room to cut interest rates.
A factor swaying sentiment was the unexpectedly strong inflationary
pressures last month arising from higher import costs, triggered by the
pound's 15 per cent devaluation since it left the European exchange rate
mechanism in September.
The cost of raw materials and fuels purchased by manufacturers rose by a
seasonally adjusted 1.5 per cent between December and January. Prices of
these items at the factory gate were 7.2 per cent higher than a year
previously, the highest year-on-year figure since May 1989.
Any sign that inflation is strengthening could dissuade the government from
a further cut in base rates from 6 per cent, in spite of calls from many
City economists and industrialists for an easing in borrowing costs to help
demand.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to come under pressure from
the Treasury's panel of outside economic advisers for an early cut in base
rates, possibly around the time of the Budget on March 16.
The seven-strong Treasury panel met for its first policy discussions
yesterday. It finished after five hours without issuing a formal statement.
The panel is due to report next week to Mr Lamont, who was warned last night
at a meeting of backbench Tory MPs not to introduce measures in the Budget
which could threaten recovery - although some Conservatives did back
increases in VAT or other taxes.
Mr Eddie George, deputy governor of the Bank of England who takes over in
July as governor, is expected in a speech in Frankfurt tomorrow to sound a
warning note about inflation in his first policy address since news of his
promotion last month.
After the heavy selling of sterling, the currency hit a low of 76.2 on its
trade-weighted index, which measures its value against a basket of
currencies. It closed slightly higher at 76.6, from 77.2 on Monday night.
Against the D-Mark, the pound came within a tenth of pfennig of its historic
low of DM2.3480 reached last Wednesday amid an earlier bout of selling.
Profit-taking saw sterling climb back slightly, to a London close of
DM2.3625 and for an overall loss on the day of 2 pfennigs, after a 3-pfennig
drop on Monday. The pound also lost further ground against the dollar,
closing down nearly 1 cent at Dollars 1.4305.
In New York, sterling closed at DM2.3655 and Dollars 1.4305.
The heavy selling on the London stock market reflected the dropping pound,
together with worries about a possible spate of rights issues. The FT-SE 100
index of leading shares closed 38.7 lower at 2,831.3. Investor sentiment was
depressed by a pessimistic tone to early Wall Street trading - the Dow Jones
Industrial Average eventually closing 22.96 down at 3,414.58.
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg Securities, the
London investment house, said: 'Sterling's torrid performance is a reminder
that there is as yet no confidence in the financial community of a cyclical
recovery in the UK.'

FT  10 FEB 93 / Storehouse chief quits to join US fashion retailer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID DWORKIN, chief executive of Storehouse, is leaving the retailing
group to become chief executive of Carter Hawley Hale Stores, one of the
largest fashion retailers in the US.
Storehouse, which includes the BhS and Mothercare chains, had been expected
to make an announcement today about the future of Mr Dworkin - who is widely
credited with having turned the group around - after its shares fell 11p to
194p on rumours he was about to resign.
But Carter Hawley Hale announced last night that Mr Dworkin was to take over
from Mr Philip Hawley as president and chief executive officer from April 1.
Storehouse refused to comment on the announcement. Mr Samuel Zell, general
partner of Zell/Chilmark Fund, CHH's principal owner, said Mr Dworkin's
appointment was a 'tremendously significant and exciting development for
CHH. David Dworkin is a proven star in the retailing industry'.
Mr Dworkin, a 49-year-old American born in Cleveland, Ohio, was recruited to
head the BhS group in November 1989 from Bonwit Teller, the US department
stores group, and became Storehouse chief executive in July 1992.
Analysts said the challenge at Carter Hawley - a successful retailer in the
1980s which had problems controlling its debt and emerged last October from
18 months in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection - would be just the sort Mr
Dworkin would relish, having laid the foundations for recovery at
Storehouse.
Mr Dworkin has reduced the size of the business, selling Habitat and
Richards, and focusing on BhS and Mothercare. He has also introduced
management reforms which have led to a consistent increase in sales and
margins at BhS.
Storehouse made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.1m for the half-year to
October, against a Pounds 13.9m loss in the previous first half.
There is no obvious successor to Mr Dworkin at Storehouse and the group is
expected to look outside for a replacement.

FT  10 FEB 93 / SFO loses test case on right to silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POWERS of the Serious Fraud Office to compel suspects to answer
questions were undermined yesterday after Mr Larry Trachtenberg, one of four
men charged over the Maxwell scandal, won the first round of a test case
against the SFO.
A charge brought by the SFO that Mr Trachtenberg had broken the law by
refusing to answer questions during a 'Section Two' interview - during which
people lose their right to silence - was dismissed yesterday by Clerkenwell
Magistrates' Court.
The stipendiary magistrate Mr Christopher Bourke, ruled that because he had
already been charged, the former adviser to the late Mr Robert Maxwell had,
as the law provides, a 'reasonable excuse' for refusing to answer the SFO's
questions.
The verdict could significantly hamper a number of the 60 investigations
currently being carried out by the SFO. Anyone charged by the SFO could use
the same argument as Mr Trachtenberg to avoid answering the SFO's questions
under Section Two.
While the SFO is not completely bound by yesterday's decision, and any
future cases will have to be decided on their individual merits, the ruling
leaves the SFO with far less room for manoeuvre in trying to make defendants
answer questions once charges have been brought against them.
The SFO said only that it was considering the implications of the court
ruling.
However, it is thought certain that it will appeal against the decision and
that the issue will have to go to the House of Lords for a final resolution.
During the hearing, Mr Trachtenberg, who was arrested in June last year,
argued that he had a reasonable excuse not to answer questions under
compulsion since he had already been charged with theft and fraud. Agreeing
with Mr Trachtenberg, the magistrate said: 'The accused, knowing he was
charged but not what grounds, was demanded on pain of imprisonment to give
up his whole case to the prosecutor.
'The Crown, thus provided, and employing the accused himself to their
advantage, would furnish their case and proceed to fashion it against him.
They thus abandon their burden of proof.'
Mr Trachtenberg, who had faced a prison sentence of up to six months, made
no comment after the hearing. His solicitor, Mr Rod Fletcher of Russell
Jones Walker, said his client's actions in refusing to answer the SFO's
questions had been 'fully vindicated'.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Disposals bring Nestle close to
EC compliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss food group, has found a buyer for most of the mineral
water assets which EC competition authorities required it to dispose of
after it acquired Groupe Perrier of France last year.
However, the proposed FFr750m (Dollars 134m) sale - to Societe
d'Investissement d'Aquitaine, holding company for the French Castel
beverages company - does not fulfil all the conditions which Brussels has
insisted on before it approves the Perrier take-over.
The Commission requires Nestle to sell to a single buyer mineral water
springs with a total annual capacity of 3bn litres and several specified
brands, including Vichy, Thonon, Pierval and Sr Yorre. But the deal with SIA
covers capacity of less than 3bn litres and excludes the Pierval brand.
Nestle said yesterday that SIA was not interested in Pierval, and that it
doubted whether any other buyer could be found for it. The Swiss company was
putting the proposed sale to Brussels, in the hope that it would nonetheless
be approved.
The Commission said that it had not yet received details of the proposed
sale from Nestle. However, a spokesman said that Nestles agreement to meet
the conditions specified last year amounted to a commitment.
Until Nestle disposes of the Perrier assets to a new owner approved by
Brussels, the Swiss company may not complete the sale of Volvic, another
large Perrier brand, to BSN, France's largest food manufacturer.
The Swiss company is counting on the proceeds of the Volvic deal to cover
part of the FFr13.4bn it paid to acquire Perrier after a hard-fought
takeover battle in which it was supported by Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN
chairman.
Nestle had apparently hoped that the Volvic sale would defuse objections
from EC competition authorities. However, Brussels judged that Nestle and
BSN would together enjoy a duopoly of the French mineral water market and
ordered disposal of some of Perrier's assets to reduce the Swiss company's
dominance.
The assets which SIA has agreed to buy had sales of more than FFr620m in
1991. The Castel group has annual revenues of FFr5.6bn.
As part of its agreement with SIA, Nestle will buy out minority shareholders
in Compagnie Fermiere de Vichy, developer of a spa and hotel project partly
financed by income from Vichy mineral water sales.

car link-up

<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the German luxury car maker, has entered a far-reaching
co-operation deal with Ssangyong Motor to enable the South Korean vehicle
maker to begin car production in Korea based on Mercedes-Benz technology.
Ssangyong, the fifth largest Korean vehicle maker, plans to produce up to
50,000 cars a year from 1996 for sale in domestic and export markets.
Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest
industrial corporation, said the Ssangyong car would be based on components
and systems from its mid-range Mercedes-Benz 200/300 series.
The car would be developed by Ssangyong, with assistance from the German car
maker, and would be produced only in Korea. It would have a different design
from current Mercedes-Benz products and would not be sold under the
Mercedes-Benz name. It would be marketed 'at Korean price levels'.
Mr Werner Niefer, Mercedes-Benz chief executive, said the deal gave his
company 'the key to one of the biggest growth markets of the future'.
Mercedes-Benz will receive licence fees and is expected to supply the
transmissions from Germany. But most other components and systems, including
engines, will be made in Korea.
Mercedes-Benz said Ssangyong would invest about DM500m (Dollars 302m)
developing the car range and production lines.
Mr Jurgen Hubbert, director of the Mercedes-Benz car division, said the deal
would allow the group to overcome entry barriers to the Korean market.
Separately, Mercedes-Benz is considering assembling cars in Korea from
German-made kits, to sell them under the Mercedes-Benz name.
The car deal is the latest in a series of links between the German group and
Ssangyong. In 1991, Mercedes-Benz licenced Ssangyong to produce up to 50,000
MB-100 vans and 100,000 engines a year, starting in 1994. In October,
Daimler-Benz took a 5 per cent equity stake in Ssangyong Motor, with an
option to raise it to 10 per cent.
Ssangyong currently produces only commercial vehicles and four-wheel drive
leisure/utility vehicles.
Korea's Ministry of Trade and Industry is expected to approve the deal
despite worries that the Korean car industry may soon have an excess number
of producers.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Highveld cuts its dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHVELD Steel and Vanadium, the South African steel producerin the Anglo
American group, reported steeply lower profits for 1992 and is to cut its
dividend.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said demand for all products had deteriorated. He
did not make a specific profit forecast for 1993 but said he expected the
bottom of the cycle would be reached this year.
While 1992 turnover rose by 8 per cent to R1.49bn (Dollars 477m), pre-tax
income fell by 32 per cent to R74.4m.
A sharp fall in the tax bill to R3.6m, from R13.6m, limited the decline in
attributable income to R70.8m from R95.6m.
An increase in the number of shares in issue, however, saw earnings per
share fall to 80.1 cents from 130 cents.
Mr Boyd said the group had faced poor steel export conditions owing to
oversupply.
Vanadium consumption - Highveld is the world's largest producer - remained
weak, owing to low consumption in the steel industry, and Mr Boyd noted that
the Vantra division operated at only 25 per cent of capacity.

to DM262m
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals group which is undergoing a
strategic re-orientation, yesterday reported a fall in pre-tax profits to
DM262m (Dollars 158m) for 1992, down from DM274m a year earlier. Turnover
fell 2 per cent to DM6.27bn from DM6.36bn.
The group said profits had been hit by the downturn in German agrichemical
business combined with the reduction in state subsidies for Berlin. This had
been offset by the profit contribution from the sale of the group's
industrial chemicals, natural substances and galvanising technology
businesses during 1992.
Schering sold the first two in November for DM660m to Witco of the US. Last
month, it transferred its electro-plating business to Elf Atochem of France.
The disposals accord with its strategy of concentrating on pharmaceuticals
and agrichemicals and abandoning areas where it does not have market
leadership.
Schering said its pharmaceutical sales rose 6 per cent to DM3.91bn despite
adverse exchange rate effects. Sales in the agrochemicals division dropped
16 per cent to DM1.27bn. There was no comment on the outlook for the 1992
dividend.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: BNP eyes purchase of Spanish
bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris, the largest of France's state-controlled banks,
is considering plans to expand its Spanish interests by buying Banco de
Fomento, a medium-sized retail bank controlled by Banco Central
Hispanoamericano.
BNP yesterday confirmed that it had been in contact with BCH and had
discussed the possibility of buying Banco de Fomento.
However, it stressed that it was only one of a number of companies to have
indicated an interest and that it had not yet made a formal offer for the
company.
The French group already has a modest presence in Spanish retail banking
through the network of 73 branches it has opened since the early 1980s.
BNP's Spanish activities also include interests in investment banking,
property finance and leasing.
BCH, Spain's biggest bank in terms of assets, was formed by the merger of
Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamericano in 1991. It wants to dispose of
associated national and regional banking networks, which duplicate its own
spread of branches.
The bank also needs to improve 1993 profits after reporting a 23 per cent
fall on pre-tax profits for last year, although that was due in part to new
Bank of Spain accounting procedures.
Fomento, which once held the former Banco Central's vast industrial
portfolio, has attracted considerable interest from other European banks -
notably Deutsche Bank, whose Spanish operation is concentrated mainly in
Catalonia - because it is one of the few retail banks available with a
national, as opposed to a regional, network.
It runs 176 offices nationwide and has assets of Pta305bn (Dollars 2.6bn).
BCH owns 76 per cent of Fomento, which reported net profits of Pta1.87bn for
last year after Pta2.39bn in 1991, a fall also explained by new accounting
rules.
BNP, a possible candidate for future privatisation, is one of Europe's
largest banks.
The bank came under pressure last year due to the competitive state of the
French banking market and the Paris property crisis, with first-half net
profits falling by 13.4 per cent to FFr1.33bn (Dollars 237.5m) on net
banking income of FFr19.48bn.
So far, BNP has adopted a more cautious attitude to international expansion
than other French banks, notably Credit Lyonnais, another large
state-controlled bank. But it has recently shown signs of a more expansive
strategy, such as last year's partnership agreement with Dresdner Bank of
Germany.

JAPAN'S ministry of finance yesterday approved brokers' plans to launch a
new cumulative stock investment scheme for retail investors next month.
Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko, Yamaichi Securities and three second-tier brokers will
offer a scheme that allows individuals to invest a minimum Y10,000 (Dollars
80) in a specific stock.
Currently, stocks can only be bought in units of 100 to 1,000 shares, and
most retail clients use investment trust funds. Under the new scheme,
investors will pay brokers between one and three instalments a month to
invest in one issue. The brokers will pool these funds to buy specific
stocks, paying the dividends according to the investors' amounts of
cumulative investment.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: JCI to hold payout in spite of
fall in profits

JOHANNESBURG Consolidated Investment, the South African mining house,
yesterday reported lower half-year profits but, thanks to solid progress by
the group's industrial investments, the outturn was better than many
analysts had feared.
Attributable earnings for the six months ended December fell by 6 per cent
to R155.6m (Dollars 49.8m) with income from investments accounting for
R136.3m, against R144.7m last time. The contribution from operating
subsidiaries fell to R4.8m from R16.8m.
Equity-accounted earnings fell by 7 per cent to R176.5m, or to 119 cents a
share from 129 cents. However, the dividend is being maintained at 42 cents
a share.
Mr Pat Retief, chairman, said trading had been very difficult with all the
commodity markets weakening. Although Mr Retief felt the group had performed
reasonably well, he cautioned that earnings during the current half were
likely to stay under pressure. Full-year results would be 'significantly
lower'.
Mr Retief said the 50 per cent decline in profit from platinum - the JCI
group is the largest producer - had had a 'major adverse impact' on results.
There had also been a 'substantial' decline in income from coal interests,
while ferrochrome producer CMI made large losses.
The industrial interests had again contributed more to group earnings than
mining. JCI's main interests are in South African Breweries, the food group
Premier, newspaper interests and the Toyota motor group.
Mr Retief said the purchase of a 10 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey, the
precious metals group, would not have a significant effect on JCI's balance
sheet and would not dilute earnings.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: IBM unveils machines to bolster
mainframe market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM, the US computer maker, has launched a range of products designed to
persuade customers that mainframe computers will remain an important feature
of corporate data processing. This is the company's first significant
announcement since Mr John Akers said he would step down as chief executive.
The statement, packed with technical detail, would be of interest chiefly to
data processing specialists were it not for IBM's financial difficulties and
the central role mainframe computers have played in the company's history.
It unveiled 18 new machines, some air cooled, some water cooled, in its
flagship Enterprise Systems range. One model, comprising eight processors
coupled together is said to be the world's most powerful general purpose
computer. No prices have been announced; IBM strikes individual deals with
customers.
IBM lost money in 1991 and 1992 in a reversal of its earlier easy mastery of
the computer business. Its Dollars 4.9bn loss in 1992 was the largest in US
corporate history.
Its financial difficulties have been attributed largely to its fixation with
mainframes. They are large, expensive machines which command high gross
profit margins but which are increasingly unpopular with customers.
They favour smaller, less expensive computers and desk top systems linked
together in networks, a trend called client-server computing.
IBM's move seems designed to convince doubtful buyers that mainframes have a
legitimate role both in client-server designs and in open systems.
Mr Nicholas Donofrio, general manager of the company's Enterprise Systems
division said: 'People think we are just in the mainframe business. In fact
we are in the large problem solving business. Compared to the traditional
mainframe market, this is a much broader opportunity. It is a Dollars 150bn
market which will grow at about 7 per cent over the next five years.'
However, he added that IBM's traditional opportunities would probably shrink
over the next four years.
IBM's mainframe revenues are reckoned to have declined by about 15 per cent,
to Dollars 9.3bn From Dollars 10.9bn last year.
However, computer experts said that for many data processing applications
there was no substitute for the raw power and flexibility of a mainframe.
These include, for example, airline reservation systems, where transactions
involving thousands of individual requests have to be processed
simultaneously.
Among yesterday's announcement was a batch of software products which would
make it easier for mainframes to act as system manager in a client-server
network.
There was an open systems version of its operating system MVS - the crucial
software which manages the working of the computer and determines which
applications it can handle.
Within hours of the launch in Europe yesterday, Siemens Nixdorf of Germany
announced its own eight processor mainframes, also using an open operating
environment.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Sears, Roebuck sinks to Dollars
3.9bn loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS, Roebuck, the troubled US retail group, yesterday reported a plunge
into net losses of Dollars 3.93bn for 1992 from profits of Dollars 1.3bn the
year before.
This is one of the biggest reversals in US corporate history and rivals
International Business Machines' recently-reported record loss of Dollars
4.96bn for the year.
However, the result had been expected by Wall Street, as Sears had
previously disclosed it would take a Dollars 1.72bn charge for restructuring
its merchandising operations and a Dollars 206.7m write-down on its Homart
Development property business.
Sears also took a Dollars 1.65bn after-tax charge for losses incurred by its
Allstate Insurance subsidiary from catastrophe claims relating to hurricanes
Andrew and Iniki. Analysts had expected a Dollars 1.25bn charge.
The group also recorded a Dollars 1.87bn charge for required accounting
changes, and a gain of Dollars 86.6m on the sale of minority interests in
two companies.
For the fourth quarter, Sears' net losses came to Dollars 1.80bn, compared
with profits of Dollars 513.1m.
On Wall Street, Sears stock rose Dollars  1/8 on the news, to close at
Dollars 49 1/2 .
Income at the group's merchandise group's sagged. Excluding unusual items,
the retail operation recorded profits of Dollars 264.9m, down from Dollars
486.3m in 1991.
Sears said disappointing automotive operations and low overall margins cut
profits. The losses at Sears' catalogue operations deepened to Dollars
159.8m, from Dollars 144.7m.
Last month, Sears announced it would streamline its merchandising operations
by closing unprofitable stores, shutting its venerable but loss-making
catalogue business, and eliminating about 16,000 full-time and 34,000
part-time staff.
These cuts followed Sears' decision in October to spin off its Dean Witter
Financial Services and Coldwell Banker property broking businesses to
concentrate on retailing and insurance.
Sears yesterday reported Dean Witter's and Coldwell Banker's results as
discontinued operations, with a combined contribution to profits of Dollars
506.9m, up from Dollars 363.3m in 1991.
Allstate Insurance reported profits of Dollars 1.17bn - excluding the impact
of hurricane Andrew and the accounting charges - up from Dollars 722.5m in
1991.
Allstate's life insurance profits were down, at Dollars 89.9m compared with
Dollars 165.6m in 1991, but its property liability underwriting expanded
profitably, to Dollars 1.01bn from Dollars 557m.
Dean Witter Financial Services reported a 19.4 per cent rise in profits to
Dollars 411.4m, up from Dollars 344.6m.
Profits at Dean Witter's credit operations, including its Discover card,
rose 21 per cent to Dollars 209.3m before extraordinary items from Dollars
173.6m.
Coldwell Banker benefited from gains in home sales and increased mortgage
writing, increasing profits to Dollars 75m, up from Dollars 26.4m.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield reports on
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVESTA SHEFFIELD, the Anglo-Swedish company which is one of Europe's biggest
stainless steel producers, has detailed the first effects of its post-merger
rationalisation and hinted of more to come.
The company was formed in November from a merger between Avesta of Sweden
and British Steel's stainless operations. Avesta shareholders have a 60 per
cent stake and British Steel owns the remainder.
Stockholm-based Avesta Sheffield said changes were already under way.
Employment is being cut from about 9,000 at the time of the merger to 8,750,
including 50 jobs in distribution, 70 in plate production, and 60 on the
precision strip side in Sweden.
In line with the job cuts, a wide-plate finishing facility at Sheffield has
been closed, and in precision strip a detailed examination is being made of
possible rationalisation at Sheffield.
Mr Per Molin, chief executive, said: 'It is already clear we will benefit
from the synergy effects we anticipated. In some cases the financial affects
are greater than we had originally envisaged.'
In spite of strong market volumes in Europe, the company is suspending
melting at its Tinsley Park site in Sheffield for the week beginning
February 15. Similar melting cuts are being introduced in Sweden, aimed at
reducing stocks and supporting a recent upward movement in prices.

SHARES in Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, rose 9 per cent
yesterday as it benefited from a better-than-expected 1992 result, a bright
forecast for 1993 and news of a healthy order intake.
The group's profit for the year fell to SKr1.30bn (Dollars 180m) from
SKr1.60bn in 1991, but this disguised an exceptionally strong fourth-quarter
performance when profits rose to SKr1.18bn from SKr97m.
It disclosed a 19 per cent increase in orders to SKr55.4bn from SKr44.7bn
and was distinctly upbeat on prospects.
Ericsson held its 1992 dividend at SKr3.50, as earnings per share dipped to
SKr3.18 from SKr3.69. Sales for 1992 rose 3 per cent to SKr47.0bn.
Many analysts believe the fourth-quarter results mark the beginning of a
strong recovery.
The driving force behind the group's performance has been its strong order
growth, as bookings have risen for five consecutive quarters. The strongest
performer has been mobile telephone systems, where order bookings rose 56
per cent last year. Confirming the trend, the group yesterday announced a
ADollars 200m (USDollars 135.1m) contract from Arena GSM to supply
telecommunications equipment for Australia's third cellular telephone
network.
The company indicated that it was well placed to win new orders from China
with a possible value of up to SKr7.4bn.
Procordia, the Swedish food and pharmaceuticals group, said yesterday it had
signed a preliminary agreement to sell its Finnish daughter company, Wallac,
to EG&amp;G, the big US technology group.
Procordia said the disposal reflected its decision to concentrate on health
care and branded consumer goods.
Wallac manufactures analytical and immunodiagnostic systems.

EUROC, the Swedish building materials group, saw profits after financial
items fall 17 per cent to SKr125m (Dollars 16.8m) in 1992, the third
successive decline, writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
The group blamed a sharp drop in construction activity in its main markets,
stiffer competition and reorganisation costs. These more than offset the
effects of cost-cutting and increased productivity. In 1991, the group made
a SKr151m profit.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Total sees 52% drop in earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TOTAL, the smaller of France's two oil groups, yesterday estimated a 52 per
cent fall in annual net profits, mainly due to a sharp decline in refining
margins, reflecting the impact of recession on the demand for refined
products.
The profits fall, to FFr2.8bn (Dollars 512m) from FFr5.8bn in 1991 is in
line with Total's warnings at the end of 1992 that net earnings would fall
by more than the 47 per cent recorded in the first six months. This
contrasts with a 35 per cent profits decline at Elf Aquitaine, Total's
larger French rival, reflecting Elf's lower exposure to refining.
Refining margins, of Dollars 4.1 per barrel, were exceptionally high in 1991
because of the demand unleashed by the Gulf war, and nearly halved to
Dollars 2.1 per barrel last year, reflecting 'world wide economic
stagnation', said Total. As a result of the difficult economic situation,
Total has taken a FFr500m non-recurring charge in last year's accounts.
Group operating profits fell by 30 per cent to FFr7.2bn from FFr10.3bn over
the period, within which refining and marketing profits were more than
halved to FFr2bn from FFr4.9bn. Total's US refineries recovered from
difficult markets in 1991 to break even last year. Exploration and
production profits were unchanged at FFr2.9bn, while trading profits fell to
FFr600m from FFr1bn. The chemicals division produced a rise in operating
profits to FFr1.7bn from FFr1.5bn, helped by an improvement in the
profitability of the recently reorganised inks and resins companies.
Total's worldwide reserves rose over the period to 531m tonnes of oil
equivalent from 513m tonnes, not including Total's interest in the new
Cusiana oil field in Colombia, discovery of which was unveiled last year.
Cash flow fell slightly to FFr10.1bn from FFr13.7bn in 1991 while capital
spending was unchanged at about FFr15bn. By the end of the year, debts stood
at 35 per cent of shareholders' funds.
Elf Sanofi, the pharmaceuticals arm of Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned
oil group, yesterday said it expected net profits of more than FFr1bn in
1992, up from FFr950m in the previous year.
The group, which last month announced a merger with Yves Saint Laurent, one
of the best known names in French fashion, attributed the improvement to the
benefits of its alliance with Sterling Winthrop, the US drugs company.

FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Axa shares hit by fall in
profits and bond issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AXA, one of France's largest insurance groups, yesterday saw its shares fall
FFr28 to FFr1,114 on the news of a fall in net profits for 1992 and of a
FFr3.65bn convertible bond issue to strengthen the capital position of
Equitable Life, its US associate.
Mr Claude Bebear, Axa chairman, said it needed to invest several hundred
million dollars in Equitable to enable the US company, in which Axa bought a
49 per cent stake in 1991, to meet the new US regulations on risk-based
capital ratios.
Equitable needs to raise its ratio from the present 85 per cent to the
required level of 100 per cent by 1995 when the new rules come into effect.
Mr Bebear stressed that the new ratio was the only reason for Axa's
investment in Equitable Life.
However, Axa suffered a sharp fall in profits last year with net
attributable profits slipping to between FFr1.5bn and FFr1.6bn from FFr2.4bn
in 1991. The group, like other French insurers, was hit by the intensely
competitive state of both the life and non-life markets in France.
Axa, which had previously announced a 34 per cent fall in first-half profits
to FFr979m, was affected by a steep reduction in the value of its
exceptional gains on sales of property and industrial investments and by a
poor second-half performance from Equitable Life.
In spite of yesterday's fall in Axa's share price analysts appeared
convinced that the investment in Equitable Life would be sufficient to solve
the ratio problems and that the US company was on course for recovery.
Analysts expect a moderate improvement in Axa's performance for 1993 in
spite of the difficulties of the French insurance market.
BNP Securities has predicted net profit of FFr2bn for this year with Paribas
forecasting FFr1.8bn.

MSC
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER SHIP Canal yesterday reported a marginal decline in pre-tax
profits for 1992, down from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 10.5m as difficult
property markets wiped out growth on its port operations.
Turnover rose 37 per cent to Pounds 27.7m (Pounds 20.2m) and operating
profits by nearly 14 per cent to Pounds 5.97m (Pounds 5.25m), thanks to a
continuing squeeze on costs.
The port made profits of Pounds 6.07m, a rise of 16 per cent on turnover up
3.5 per cent at Pounds 20.9m and cargoes ahead 2.8 per cent at 7.96m tonnes.
This, however, was not enough to counter falling income from property and
investments, and there was an exceptional debit of Pounds 1.45m to disband
the company's police force.
The company's main port interests are concentrated around Ellesmere Port and
Runcorn in Cheshire, while most of its property comprises the old Manchester
docklands at Trafford Park and Salford Quays, where there is local
oversupply of new office space.
Tax took Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 2.2m credit) - because of reduced enterprise
zone allowances.
This caused earnings per share to fall to 219.6p (339p). The proposed single
dividend is unchanged at 4.5p.
Shareholders' funds improved from Pounds 137.3m to Pounds 153.1m after
revaluation of dredging deposit grounds and the company's interest in a
waste disposal site.
Mr Robert Hough, chairman, said the property division had 'weathered the
storms reasonably well'. Rental income had fallen by Pounds 700,000, but
properties had been sold for Pounds 9.88m at a profit of Pounds 390,000.
He believed Harbour City, the flagship development in Salford Quays, would
eventually attract more tenants because of its high standard of design. He
also hoped for a government decision this year on the company's Dumplington
site.
The 300-acre site is on the south bank of the canal at the junction of four
motorways. A regional shopping centre is proposed.

FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Fatter and ready for market / A look at the
flotation plans of Yorkshire Food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Food Group, which has expanded rapidly by buying ingredients
businesses from Berisford International, will be floated on the market this
spring.
The Bradford-based business was founded by Mr Mike Firth, 46, the chairman
and chief executive.
In 1991 Yorkshire, backed by institutions, paid Pounds 11m for Scotia Haven
Foods, Berisford's loss-making dried fruit business, and last year bought
Treehouse Farms, Berisford's Californian almond processor, for Dollars 9.96m
(Pounds 6.6m).
These acquisitions boosted Yorkshire's turnover from Pounds 15m in 1990 to
more than Pounds 60m last year. Operating profits have grown from Pounds
664,000 to more than Pounds 3.5m. The group is expected to have a market
value of about Pounds 35m.
A forceful Yorkshireman, Mr Firth and his team transformed Scotia Haven's
pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.29m in the year before acquisition to a profit of
Pounds 900,000 by squeezing working capital.
Stock values were reduced from more than Pounds 6m to Pounds 1.5m by the end
of 1991, so outside warehousing totalling 70,000 sq ft was no longer
required at the plant near Warrington, Cheshire.
Stock control was integrated with the production, buying and sales
functions, and improved credit controls helped cash management.
Permanent staff kept their jobs, but 80 fewer seasonal workers were employed
and nine senior managers were replaced by three from Yorkshire Foods.
However, Yorkshire is not just in the business of trimming costs. Treehouse
incurred a loss of Dollars 743,000 in the year before it was acquired, but
the new owners brought it back into profit by substantially increasing the
company's purchase of nuts - almost all of which were sold by Christmas.
Mr Firth believes that the same management disciplines can be applied to
other parts of the food industry, and Yorkshire intends to make further
substantial acquisitions. He said: 'It comes down to ambition - I believe we
have a management team which is capable of running a much bigger company.'
Mr Firth, who studied physics at Bradford University, established his own
packaging business in 1974 with a Pounds 3,000 bank loan after he quit as a
production manager with Mars.
He said: 'Mars offered me promotion, but I'd always wanted to run my own
business and did not want to get used to a fat salary.'
After packaging toys and games, in 1979 he established Normanton Foods, near
Leeds, which packs sugar, mainly for Sainsbury.
It later expanded into direct purchasing of raw materials for packing and
selling to retail chains.
In 1983 Mr Firth bought the stock of Hunni Foods, a commodity packer of nuts
and pulses from the receiver for Pounds 25,000 - and then sold it for Pounds
40,000. Hunni brought an additional range of products, a label and a modest
customer base, which by 1985 extended to Wm Morrison Supermarkets.
Mr Firth relishes the cut and thrust of the commercial fray. He recalls an
early attempt to drive him out of business by a major competitor, which
offered to supply Morrison at practically cost price.
Morrison allowed him to keep the reduced-rate business, but Mr Firth
obtained a copy of the competitor's rock-bottom bid, and delighted in faxing
it to buyers of all the leading supermarket chains. Mr Firth said: 'The
whole affair cost me about Pounds 150,000, but it must have cost them Pounds
1.5m. I've never enjoyed myself so much.'
Yorkshire has two beverage subsidiaries near Halifax - Freshroast Coffee,
which roasts and packs beans, and Coffee Mac, which offers an extensive
range of beverage dispensing machines.
Although the businesses account for only about 4 per cent of the enlarged
group's sales, they enjoy high margins and the group intends to build Coffee
Mac, which currently has 500 machines installed, into a national chain.
The group has enjoyed more mixed fortunes with its two baking subsidiaries,
Forshaws (Confectioners) and Crossfield, which supply pies to retailers and
caterers.
Last year the daily delivered confectionery business and bakery business was
closed because of the high levels of investment needed in an extremely
competitive market.
Crossfield has won important contracts, such as supplying part-baked frozen
pies, which have a distinctive 'home-made look' to EuroDisney in France.
Baking represents only 2.5 per cent of group sales, but Mr Firth is
determined to learn more about the bakery business - which he estimates is
worth more than Pounds 3bn annually.
However, there is no doubt that Yorkshire's main focus will be on relatively
large food processing and packaging operations, where the management's tight
controls have most scope for finding cost-savings and greater efficiency.
Mr Firth said: 'It is easier to make savings with big numbers. You also
spend the same time on a Pounds 40m deal as you do on a Pounds 4m one.'
The group, which will have gearing of about 30 per cent after the flotation,
is likely to make a fairly rapid move in the UK. Longer-term, Mr Firth likes
the West Coast of the US, and believes the size of the domestic market there
means many American businesses do not fully appreciate export opportunities.
Yorkshire will come to the market through a placing sponsored by
stockbrokers Panmure Gordon. It is being advised by National Westminster
Bank.
The group has been backed by Murray Johnstone's venture capital arm and
Phildrew Ventures.

350,000
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETACOM, the telecommunications equipment supplier which is 71.3 per cent
owned by Mr Alan Sugar's Amstrad, returned to the black in the half-year to
December 31 1992.
On turnover from continuing operations ahead to Pounds 6.67m (Pounds 5.11m)
 -reflecting an expanded product range, particularly in telephone answering
machines - pre-tax profits emerged at Pounds 350,000 against losses of
Pounds 644,000 in the corresponding six months.
The figures were compiled under FRS 3 accounting principles.
Costs of restructuring and rationalising the range amounted to Pounds
73,000.
The result was helped by an interest turnround to Pounds 145,000 receivable
(Pounds 218,000 payable), and included an operating profit of Pounds 213,000
(Pounds 324,000) from discontinued businesses.
The disposal of the Loewe Betacom joint venture was completed in September.
Operating profits from continuing operations totalled Pounds 65,000, against
a deficit of Pounds 196,000.
Mr Ken Ashcroft, chairman and former corporate finance director at Amstrad,
said the group 'was now recovering its market share in the UK after an
extremely difficult period'.
Net assets at the period end amounted to Pounds 10.4m, including cash of
Pounds 3.4m.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.46p, against losses of 3.86p.

FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Halifax focuses eyes on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX Building Society yesterday disclosed that it was preparing its first
venture into Europe by applying for a licence to establish a subsidiary in
Spain to attract retail savings deposits for mortgage lending.
The application contrasts with other moves by societies to expand in Europe
by acquisition. Abbey National acquired a mortgage lending business in Spain
in 1989, which has been hit by losses on residential mortgages.
Halifax said it wanted to test the market for retail savings and mortgage
lending similar to its core business in the UK by establishing a branch
office in Madrid. A Spanish general manager would join the society on March
1.
The society said its application had been submitted to the Spanish ministry
of economy and finance in December, and a response was awaited. The
operation would be called Banco Halifax Hispania.
Mr Jim Birrell, chief executive, said Spain was a good long-term market.
'Our approach will be a cautious learning exercise, with the initial focus
on savings. This is in keeping with our traditional core business.'

FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: MTM sells US plant for Dollars 9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTM, the specialist chemicals company struggling with a bank refinancing and
the arrival of a large new shareholder with mysterious intentions, has sold
a business in the US.
The group said it had received Dollars 9.05m (Pounds 6m) for the sale of its
intermediate fine chemicals plant in Columbus, Ohio, to ISF Fine Chemicals,
a subsidiary of GAF Corporation of New Jersey.
MTM will receive Dollars 7.05m on completion and the balance will be held in
escrow pending clarification of the value of working capital and potential
warranty claims.
MTM is trying to focus its attention on fewer businesses in order to reduce
group debt, now standing at about Pounds 120m.
Last week AB Hebi, a Swedish company, bought nearly 7 per cent of MTM from
Mr Richard Lines, the chairman who built the company and eventually oversaw
a precipitate decline in the share price.

Standard Platforms Holdings, the USM-quoted computer hardware and software
group, has disposed of its US DocuFile subsidiary to Mr Martin Caniff, its
president
This was the only firm offer received although the company had been in
negotiations with three potential purchasers. In the light of the DocuFile
disposal, Mr HS Hardy, whose main area of responsibility has been within
that company, has resigned from the Standard Platforms board without
compensation.
Provision of Pounds 100,000 relating to the disposal has been made in the
current interim accounts. For the six months to September 30 there were
substantially lower pre-tax losses of Pounds 22,673 after the provision,
against losses of Pounds 471,341.
Turnover more than doubled to Pounds 1.88m (Pounds 849,497), some Pounds
165,287 (Pounds 24,560) of which related to the discontinued operations of
DocuFile.
Losses per share were 0.5p (12.1p). There is no dividend.

</HEADLINE>

CREDIT RATINGS on the preferred stock of both BET and Rank Organisation were
downgraded sharply yesterday by Moody's Investor Service, the US rating
agency.
Both companies' stock was cut by two notches, from A2 to Baa1, while both
also lost the top Prime-1 rating on its commercial paper.
The BET move reflected the lengthy restructuring expected in its core
businesses, 'intense competitive pressure' on operating margins and possible
delays in disposing of underperforming assets, Moody's said. It expected
Rank's recovery from the recession to be 'significantly delayed,' and added
that the company would need to continue to restructure to improve returns.

FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Attack on overheads helps P&amp;P - Pounds 8.9m
charge for change of emphasis clears ground for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
P&amp;P, the personal computer distributor and computing services supplier, is
beginning to show the benefits of a determined attack on escalating
overheads, with a profit before tax last year of Pounds 2.01m, up from
Pounds 711,000 previously.
The company, however, recorded a net loss for the full year of Pounds 7.88m,
as a result of taking an extraordinary charge of Pounds 8.93m to cover the
costs of extricating itself from the distribution of high volume, low-cost
personal computers - a business where cost cutting and intense competition
have reduced margins to unprofitable levels.
The share price yesterday rose 5p to 44p.
Turnover in the year to November 30 1992 was slightly lower at Pounds 222.8m
(Pounds 228.3m). However, as personal computer prices have been falling at
up to 40 per cent a year for the past two years, the bald figures conceal a
substantial increase in volume of business.
Earnings per share were more than doubled at 1.9p (0.7p) and a final
dividend of 0.7p is declared, making a total of 1.4p (4.33p).
Shareholders' funds remain in excess of Pounds 40m, or 72p a share, and the
company has net cash of Pounds 3m.
P&amp;P has suffered over the past two years through being one of the largest
participants in a sector where profit margins have fallen steadily.
It has now taken the step of disengaging itself from the high volume
distribution of low cost computers where gross profit margins were only 10
per cent. That leaves it in computing services, with gross profit margins of
close to 60 per cent, and in higher value computer products where gross
margins of over 20 per cent can be achieved.
The Pounds 40m-a-year-sales high volume business, comprising relationships
with dealers and contracts with manufacturers and P&amp;P itself, will either be
sold or run down.
Mr David Southworth, group managing director, said the worst was over: 'If
we manage cash and overheads for the next two years, we will do very well.'
COMMENT
Mr Southworth is looking a good deal happier these days. The decision to cut
away the least profitable part of the business and to take the Pounds 8.9m
charge for doing so has cleared the ground for recovery and the management
team has already shown its competence in coming to grips with costs. Forward
profits are difficult to predict in the computer business in the current
climate, but it would be surprising if there was not a strong advance on
1992. With a historic p/e of about 23 there seems little reason to quibble
with analysts' opinion of a strong buy.

FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Falcon moving to Luxembourg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FALCON MINES, the Zimbabwean gold mining group, is moving out of the UK so
as not to become liable for UK corporation tax, in particular advance
corporation tax on its dividends.
The group, which has no operations in the UK, plans a reconstruction and a
move to Luxembourg.
Until the 1988 Finance Act, companies could be incorporated in the UK
without being resident for tax purposes if their operations were overseas.
However, that act said such companies would become resident for tax purposes
after five years. That provision comes into effect on March 15 this year.
Fewer than 20 per cent of Falcon's shares are held in the UK, and the shares
are also listed in Zimbabwe and South Africa.
Falcon's immediate problem, if it remained in the UK, would be that it would
become liable for ACT on dividends paid to all its shareholders and would
not be able to recover that tax.
At present it has to obtain permission under Zimbabwean exchange controls to
take money out of that country to pay dividends to non-Zimbabwean investors.
Falcon felt it was unlikely to receive permission to take money out of
Zimbabwe to pay UK taxes on dividends paid to shareholders in Zimbabwe.
The group is proposing to move its entire assets and undertakings to a new
company, Falcon Investments, which will be based in Luxembourg.
Under the plan, which is to be put to shareholders at two special meetings,
holders will receive one new Falcon Investments share for every 10 Falcon
Mines shares held.
Falcon Investments shares will be quoted in Luxembourg, as well as Zimbabwe
and South Africa, with dealings commencing on March 15. UK investors will be
able to trade in Falcon Investments shares in London under Stock Exchange
Rule 535 (4) (A). If the proposals are approved, shares in Falcon Mines will
cease to trade on March 12 and the company will be wound up.

FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Powerscreen disposes of Guzzler for Dollars
24m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERSCREEN International, the Northern Ireland-based maker of screening and
crushing equipment, has sold one of its US subsidiaries for Dollars 24m
(Pounds 16.8m) to Federal Signal Corporation.
Guzzler Manufacturing, which makes truck-mounted vacuum cleaning equipment
for industrial sites and sewers, was bought by Powerscreen for Dollars 17.9m
in August 1990.
Mr Barry Cosgrove, finance director, said Federal Signal's first approach
had been rebuffed. An improved cash offer had changed the management's mind.
He added that Powerscreen had taken Dollars 5.3m cash out of Alabama-based
Guzzler in debt repayments and interest since its purchase. The US company
made Dollars 2.1m in after-tax profits on Dollars 27m sales in 1991-92. But
that was on a low tax rate of 10 per cent. By next year that rate was
expected to rise to 38 per cent.
Mr Shay McKeown, chief executive, said profits from Guzzler were expected to
fall to Dollars 1.6m pre-tax this year. It was the one company in the group
not performing to budget.
Guzzler's margins had been eroded by price competition in the contractor
market. Federal Signal, which has a street cleaning operation, was in a
better position to expand Guzzler in the municipal market, whereas
Powerscreen would have had to expand its product range into sweepers and
refuse vehicles.
'We don't want to be a conglomerate,' said Mr McKeown. The group had decided
to concentrate on materials handling, where it has built up international
sales of mobile equipment. North America would account for approaching 30
per cent of group turnover even after the Guzzler disposal.
Powerscreen was now expected to have at least Pounds 20m cash in hand at the
March year-end. The prime candidate for the next acquisition would be a
North American crushing equipment company, preferably involved in the
recycling of demolition material or timber.
The UK, which accounted for 29 per cent of first-half sales, would also be
an attractive hunting ground. Targets on the Continent tended to look
expensive because of the weakened pound.
Powerscreen, which has kept profits moving ahead during the recession, is
forecast to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 18.8m - on Pounds 88.1m
sales - to between Pounds 22m and Pounds 23m this year.
Its share price closed down 1p at 359p yesterday. That compares with 156p at
the time of the Guzzler acquisition. The 6.16m shares allotted to the vendor
were placed - they are worth Pounds 22m compared with less than Pounds 10m
then.

FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Aberdeen Petroleum moves for Brabant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABERDEEN Petroleum, the US-based oil and gas production company which is
quoted in London, yesterday threw down the gauntlet to Brabant Resources
with an all-paper bid valuing the UK explorer at Pounds 6.5m.
The move follows Aberdeen's protracted efforts to reach agreement on a
friendly merger with Brabant. If successful, a takeover would double
Aberdeen's issued capital.
Mr Nicholas Gay, Brabant's finance director, said his group still strongly
opposed any proposals from Aberdeen. 'It is not consistent with Brabant's
strategy and there is no clear synergy,' he said.
Brabant would delay its results, due tomorrow, until Aberdeen's offer
document is published.
Aberdeen is offering 35 shares - which closed 1 1/4 p down at 11 1/4 p  -
for every 10 Brabant. This values Brabant at 39.3p per share, compared with
last night's close of 39p, up 10p on the day.
Aberdeen already controls 21.4 per cent of Brabant. This includes its
holding of 9.99 per cent and irrevocable undertakings from Titon Oil &amp;
Metals to accept the bid in respect of its 11.4 per cent stake.
Mr David Hooker, Aberdeen's managing director, said the takeover made sense
in the light of an inevitable rationalisation of the small oil and gas
sector. 'If we can glue a lot of these companies together, and increase
liquidity, it would make sense (for institutional shareholders)', he said.
Significant savings could be achieved on overheads and by cutting down
exploration.
The bid was described by analysts and some institutional investors as
opportunistic, however. One analyst suggested that Aberdeen, with all its
assets in North America, 'is carrying costs in the UK which the US is not
happy about'.
A large shareholder also suggested that Aberdeen was trying to fend off its
own potential predator. Pittencrief, the telecommunications and resource
group, recently took a 16.6 per cent stake in Aberdeen. Pittencrief is
reported to be building up its oil and gas assets in advance of a demerger
of its two divisions.

FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Shell sells bulk of Colas division for
Pounds 72m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL UK has sold its road services and building materials subsidiaries to a
management-led buy-out vehicle backed by Charterhouse Development Capital.
The subsidiaries form the main part of Shell's Colas division. They include
one of Europe's leading manufacturers of road markings and have been sold
for Pounds 72m, which includes Pounds 20m of net cash. The purchase price is
close to asset value, the company's advisers said.
The road services business trades under names such as Prismo in the UK and
Prosign in France. The building materials company manufactures roofing felts
and flooring adhesives in the UK. The subsidiaries acquired employ about
1,400 people.
Charterhouse underwrote the Pounds 30m equity portion of the deal. The
former management will take a small stake.
The debt portion of the transaction, equal to Pounds 22m before working
capital, was arranged by Morgan Grenfell and underwritten by the Bank of
Scotland. Shell was advised by Lazards.
Two other companies within the Colas group, road surfacer Colas Limited and
civil engineer Colcon, were not for sale and will remain within Shell UK.

FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Reed Intl sells stake in BSkyB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED International yesterday reached an agreement to sell its indirect stake
in British Sky Broadcasting in a deal worth Pounds 62.3m.
Reed is selling its 3.66 per cent stake in BSkyB, the satellite television
venture, to the other three principal shareholders in BSB Holdings -
Chargeurs, Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, and Granada.
Reed, part of the merged Reed Elsevier publishing group, will receive Pounds
12.3m in cash immediately.
The balance will be paid over the next two or three years out of any
proceeds that flow to the three shareholders from BSkyB, whether from
dividends or interest payments.
The deal takes Reed to the head of the queue for any money flowing from the
satellite venture.
Mr Peter Davis, chairman of Reed, said: 'It is a deal arrived at between the
three and ourselves freely because they don't have to buy and we don't have
to sell.'

FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hunting coatings side sold for Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNTING, the defence, aviation and oil services company, has sold its
specialist coatings division to Williams Holdings, the industrial
conglomerate, for about Pounds 19m.
The sale marks the end of Hunting's attempt to develop a special coatings
leg that would reduce group dependence on a declining defence market.
Mr Ken Miller, chief executive, said the group had already gone a long way
along a better diversification path with the development of its oil services
and aviation divisions.
Yesterday Hunting added two Houston-based oil service companies at a cost of
Pounds 5m. It also announced a Pounds 250,000 purchase from Pirelli of
Sekur, an Italian defence company whose products include fuel tanks and
rubber components for tracked vehicles.
Hunting also said that in December it raised Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) for a
5-10 year period through a dollar private placement. The announcements come
only days after it was awarded a seven year contract to manage the UK
government's Atomic Weapons Establishment at four sites including
Aldermaston in Berkshire.
As a result of the deals, gearing should fall from the 70 per cent level
prevailing at the end of December, according to Mr Miller.
This was after taking account of additional working capital requirements to
fund the AWE contract and the benefit to shareholders funds from a Pounds
10m profit over book value on the sale.
The coatings businesses, which trade under the Hammerite name, will be an
addition to the Williams stable of consumer building products that include
Polycell and Cuprinol.
Mr Nigel Rudd, Williams chairman, said the deal was consistent with group
policy of buying market leading brands in the consumer building product and
fire and safety areas.
Hunting shares closed up 13p at 233p.

FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Isosceles disposes of US sports goods chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the heavily-indebted parent company of the Gateway food retail
group trying to renegotiate its debt, has finally agreed the sale of
Herman's Sporting Goods, its US chain of 259 sports shops.
The price agreed with the purchaser, an investor group led by the
Taggart/Fasola Group, a US management firm which specialises in turnround
situations, was not disclosed. However, it is thought that Isosceles will
receive about Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m) for the chain.
Isosceles has been trying to sell Herman's since it succeeded with a Pounds
2.1bn leveraged buy-out of Gateway in 1989.
The sale of Herman's is expected to close in early March. Mr William
Taggart, chairman of the Taggart/Fasola Group, said 'in order to grow in the
1990s Herman's will need fresh capital and fresh ideas'.
Dee Corporation, the former incarnation of Gateway, paid Pounds 278m for
Herman's in 1986 and then expanded it by acquiring another chain for Pounds
45m. Even before Isosceles' bid for Gateway, Herman's was proving an unhappy
investment.
Soon after Isosceles bought Gateway it is thought to have received an offer
for Herman's of about Dollars 300m (then about Pounds 200m), but this fell
through when the buyer was unable to assemble the necessary funds. Another
possible purchase fell through in October last year.
In Isosceles' last accounts, for the year to April 25 1992, the investment
in Herman's was written down by Pounds 144.8m. It was shown in the balance
sheet under 'investments held for disposal' and was thought to make up the
bulk of the Pounds 57.7m value put on these. Another write-down is therefore
expected in the next accounts.
Isosceles is currently in talks with its lenders over a refinancing of
Pounds 1.4bn debt. It has a standstill agreement with its banks until May 28
this year.
It has yet to publish interim results, and these may not appear until
agreement on the refinancing is reached.

FT  10 FEB 93 / UAP and Axa post sharp falls for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE problems in the French insurance industry were highlighted yesterday
when Union des Assurances de Paris and Axa, two of France's largest
insurance companies, yesterday announced sharp falls in their net profits
for 1992.
Axa's shares fell FFr28 to FFr1,114 on a fall in net profits for 1992 and a
FFr3.65bn (Dollars 652m) convertible bond issue to strengthen the capital
position of Equitable Life, its US associate.
Mr Claude Bebear, Axa chairman, said it needed to invest several hundred
million dollars in Equitable to enable the US company, in which Axa bought a
49 per cent stake in 1991, to meet new US regulations on risk-based capital
ratios. Equitable needs to raise its ratio from 85 per cent to 100 per cent
by 1995 when the new rules come into effect. Mr Bebear stressed the new
ratio was the only reason for Axa's investment in Equitable Life.
However, Axa suffered a fall in profits last year with net attributable
profits slipping to between FFr1.5bn and FFr1.6bn from FFr2.4bn in 1991. The
group, like other French insurers, was hit by the intensely competitive
state of both the life and non-life markets in France.
UAP last night warned of a fall in net profits to between FFr1bn and
FFr1.3bn last year from FFr3.76bn in 1991.
News of UAP's profit fall, which was made after the Paris stock market had
closed and suggests that the group's 1992 performance was worse than
analysts' expectations, comes at a delicate time for the company. UAP is a
prime candidate for privatisation.
UAP yesterday said that the main cause of last year's reduction in profits
was its exposure to Banque Worms, its French banking subsidiary. The bank
lost FFr350m in the first half of last year, and is expected to have lost
FFr1bn during the full year.
UAP last month was forced to provide FFr1.4bn in emergency recapitalisation
for Banque Worms. UAP increased group turnover by 19 per cent to FFr125bn
last year.
However, this growth was mainly due to the contribution from Sun Life, the
UK insurer. The group said yesterday that the level of underlying growth in
its existing business was 5 per cent.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Reuters raises dividend as cash increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS HOLDINGS, the business information and news group, dipped into a
growing cash pile to increase its dividend for the year by 24.7 per cent, in
spite of difficulties which continue to affect its main financial customers.
The group's pre-tax profits grew 12.6 per cent to Pounds 383.2m in the year
to December 31. Net cash balances rose by Pounds 206.9m to Pounds 709.8m. A
29 per cent increase in the final dividend to 15.9p from 12.3p gives a total
for the year of 21.2p (17p).
Mr Peter Job, chief executive, said: 'Market conditions are favourable
enough to sustain growth across all our product lines. Problems affecting
the financial community in some of our major markets, such as Japan, will
probably mean that the rate of increase in our underlying revenue is not as
fast as we would like.' About 80 per cent of Reuters' revenues are
designated in non-sterling currencies, so the devaluation of the pound is
likely to boost revenues, although the full benefits will only flow through
to earnings as currency hedges unwind.
Mr Job said: 'Our cash position is strong enough to allow us to pursue new
investment ideas and, at the same time, to recommend an increase in dividend
well ahead of earnings growth.'
Earnings per share grew 2.3 per cent to 56p, but this was depressed by an
extraordinary charge of Pounds 24.6m relating to an Australian tax
settlement. Before the extraordinary item, earnings were 12.9 per cent
higher at 61.8p.
Reuters' revenue grew 4.5 per cent, adjusted to exclude the effect of
currency movements. The Americas turned in a record performance, assisted by
the rapid growth of Instinet, the subsidiary which runs an equities
transaction business. The American contribution to profits was Pounds 15m,
compared with a loss of Pounds 5.2m last time. Revenue grew 13.6 per cent to
Pounds 259.4m.
Strong revenue growth in eastern Europe and the China region was offset by
continuing weakness of the financial services sector in several main
centres. At actual rates of exchange the revenue of Europe, the Middle East
and Africa grew 5.9 per cent to Pounds 952.8m, and the contribution to
profits rose 9.7 per cent to Pounds 334.7m. Revenue from the Asia-Pacific
region rose 6.4 per cent to Pounds 297m and the contribution to profits rose
6.1 per cent to Pounds 131.8m.
Mr Job was satisfied with the progress of two new products, Dealing 2000-2,
which offers automated foreign exchange dealing, and Globex, which provides
a similar service for futures and options.
Operating profit before interest grew 8.9 per cent to Pounds 316.5m, and
interest receivable rose 33.8 per cent to Pounds 66.3m. Capital expenditure
was 24.9 per cent higher at Pounds 198.7m.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Dame Shirley Porter to head LBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAME Shirley Porter, the Conservative politician, will today be appointed
chairman of LBC, the London commercial radio station now effectively
controlled by Porter family interests.
Mr Christopher Chataway, the LBC chairman who is also chairman of Crown
Communications, the broadcasting company now in receivership, has decided to
step down as chairman.
It is believed that Mr Chataway, the former Conservative minister who now
chairs the Civil Aviation Authority, was asked to stay on by the new
controllers of LBC, Mr John Porter Dame Shirley's son, and Mr Matthew
Cartisser, his partner.
Mr Porter and Mr Cartisser are the main shareholders in Chelverton
Investments, a company which now owns 49 per cent of LBC and has an option
on a further 2 per cent.
Mr Chataway, it is believed, has told Mr Porter he will not have the time to
chair LBC during the station's franchise renewal period. The LBC frequencies
will be advertised by the Radio Authority next month.
He will however stay on as a non-executive director and support LBC's bid to
regain its franchise.
A key element in Mr Chataway's support for the new regime at LBC was the
renewal of the contract of Mr David Haynes, the chief executive.
Mr Haynes and Mr Chataway were keen supporters of the move into France and
the purchase of a stake in RFM which turned into a disaster for the group.
Crown was forced into receivership when the CSA, the French broadcasting
authority, blocked the sale of the network.
Meanwhile Mr Patrick Meyer, the founder of RFM, who sold out to Crown and
now lives in the US, has decided to make a bid for his old radio network.
Mr Meyer, speaking from Arizona, said he has the support of a big financial
institution and a famous French artist. He also plans to make stock
available to the staff of the network, which has 114 stations. RFM is now in
receivership but is still trading and playing pop music.
Mr Meyer says he will soon be presenting his case to the CSA, RFM staff and
the receiver when one is officially appointed. 'It is a good station if you
get the right format and don't change it all the time,' he added.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Dworkin to quit Storehouse for US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Dworkin, chief executive of Storehouse, is leaving the retailing
group to become chief executive of Carter Hawley Hale Stores, one of the
largest fashion retailers in the US.
Storehouse, which includes the BhS and Mothercare chains, was expected to
make an announcement today about the future of Mr Dworkin - who is widely
credited with having turned the group around - after its shares fell 11p to
194p on rumours that he was about to resign. But Carter Hawley Hale
announced last night that Mr Dworkin was to take over from Mr Philip Hawley
as president and chief executive officer from April 1.
Mr Samuel Zell, general partner of Zell/Chilmark Fund, CHH's principal
owner, said Mr Dworkin's appointment was a 'tremendously significant and
exciting development for CHH. David Dworkin is a proven star in the
retailing industry.'
Mr Dworkin, a 49-year-old American born in Cleveland, Ohio, was recruited to
head the BhS group in November 1989 from Bonwit Teller, the US department
stores group.
Analysts and industry insiders said the challenge at Carter Hawley - a
successful retailer in the 1980s which had problems controlling its debt and
emerged last October from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection - would be just
the sort Mr Dworkin would relish, having laid the foundations for recovery
at Storehouse.
Pre-tax profits at Storehouse increased from Pounds 1.3m in 1990 to Pounds
15.8m last year, and are forecast to reach around Pounds 20m this year.
Mr Dworkin has reduced the size of the business, selling off Habitat and
Richards, and focusing the group on BhS and Mothercare.
Management reforms, a revamp of the stores' image and products and better
use of space and computers, have all contributed to a consistent increase in
sales and margins at BhS over the last 15 months.
Although the City reacted badly to rumours of Mr Dworkin's departure,
analysts said this would not be disastrous as he had already taken all the
fundamental steps required.
There is no obvious successor within Storehouse, and the group is expected
to look outside for a replacement.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Bundesbank aims to give Frankfurt markets a lift: David
Waller analyses the latest cut in German banks' reserve requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German interest-rate cut announced last Thursday was only third among
items on the Bundesbank's press release. Higher up the list - and more
important, in the view of Mr Johann Gaddum of the Bundesbank council - were
the move to cut reserve requirements for German banks and to introduce
DM25bn (Pounds 10bn) of short-term government securities.
Given the international implications of the interest rate move, Mr Gaddum's
tongue must have been partly in his cheek. Still, from the point of view of
Finanzplatz Deutschland, Germany as a financial centre, the importance of
the other measures should not be under-estimated.
They are the latest in a series of moves in which the Bundesbank has lifted
restrictions on German financial services with the aim of strengthening
Frankfurt's competitive position in the battle against other European
financial centres.
Two such initiatives in recent years have helped create a flourishing
futures and options market - the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) - and a
successful commercial paper market. Thursday's decisions are at least as
important.
For years, bankers have complained that the Bundesbank's reserve
requirements have acted as a brake on profitability and played into the
hands of bankers in Luxembourg, London and Paris. For every DM100 that a
German bank took as a deposit, it was obliged to place between DM4.50 and
DM12.10 with the central bank, interest free.
From the Bundesbank's point of view, this was a useful way of keeping
control of monetary developments. For the commercial banks it meant that
they could not pay as much interest to depositors as banks in other
countries where reserves were non-existent (as in Luxembourg) or small (as
in London, where they are 0.35 per cent). Interest rates on deposits in
Luxembourg have traditionally been 150 basis points higher than in Germany.
By some calculations, more than DM200bn is deposited in D-Mark accounts
outside Germany, driven abroad because of the impact of reserve requirements
on marginal interest rates. Last year alone more than DM60bn left Germany to
be deposited in Luxembourg, often with local branches of German banks.
Reserve requirements are an important contributor to this trend (though
Germany's withholding tax is probably the main impetus.)
The Bundesbank has not, in its latest move, gone so far as abolish all
minimum reserves: they were cut from an average of 4.5 per cent to 2 per
cent on time deposits and savings deposits. They were left unchanged on
sight deposits, where the reserve can be as high as 12.5 per cent.
In total, however, the cut has liberated DM32bn of reserves currently lodged
interest-free by banks with the Bundesbank. This meant a windfall gain for
Germany's big banks, reflected in strong share gains last week.
It has also 'removed some of the competitive differential with Luxembourg
and other financial centres', says Mr Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at
the Dresdner Bank - and raised the possibility of further easing in the
requirements in the future.
The second item on Thursday's list is the announcement of DM25bn of new
short-term government securities - Bubils as they have already been
christened. These are to be issued next month with maturities of three, six
and nine months, and fill an important gap in the range of investment
products on offer.
Corporate treasurers will be among the most enthusiastic purchasers of the
new securities, but they will be issued in minimum denominations of
DM100,000, so they will be attractive to wealthy individuals as an
alternative to bank savings accounts.
At present the only way for investors to buy short-term risk-free
investments is to buy commercial paper issued by the Treuhand, the
government's privatisation agency for eastern Germany, which is the biggest
issuer on the German CP market. The shortest maturity for bunds is one year,
but the bulk of the government's lending is conducted with longer
maturities.
'It rounds out the range of products you will be able to invest in in
Germany in comparison to the US,' says Mr Mark Houghton-Berry at Goldman
Sachs in Frankfurt. The new instruments are likely to be of interest to
institutional investors and to central banks which hold D-Marks as reserves.
Taken as a whole, last week's measures reflect the fact that money market
operations - conducted at the moment through regular auctions of security
repurchase agreements (repos) and other instruments - are more important
than reserves in the battle to contain inflation. The new instruments will
round out the Bundesbank's armoury of money-market tools used to fine-tune
German interest rates and monetary developments.
'Compared to minimum reserves, the new instruments will give much more
sensitivity to the central bankers in their steering of monetary policy,'
said Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at the Bayerische Vereinsbank. 'The
money market is too narrow and does not have enough instruments.'
The new paper is not just a convenience; it also marks an important shift in
the way the Bundesbank deals with German liquidity, by giving it the ability
to influence the holdings of German companies. 'For the first time it will
allow the Bundesbank to influence liquidity outside the banking system in
the corporate sector,' said Mr Friedrich at Dresdner Bank. 'It will be able
to go right to the heart of non-bank liquidity.'
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                    BUNDESBANK'S KEY CHANGES
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
DM25bn of new short-term instruments roughly doubles amount of
Federal paper available in money markets.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Switch of emphasis from minimum reserves to money market will raise
importance of day-to-day Bundesbank operations to influence rates.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
German banks will now earn interest on DM32bn of money that was
previously tied up interest-free with the Bundesbank.  Helps them
compete for D-Mark deposits with offshore centres.

FT  10 FEB 93 / Charter Consolidated disposes of stake in Johnson Matthey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHARTER CONSOLIDATED, the UK industrial group, yesterday achieved its
long-held ambition to dispose of its 38.3 per cent shareholding in Johnson
Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group. Charter will collect
about Pounds 342m from the sale.
A large part of the Charter holding, representing 20 per cent of JM, is to
be bought for Pounds 187.8m or 490p for each JM share by a new company
jointly set up by Minorco, the Luxembourg investment company, and
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Corporation, the South African mining
group.
All four are perceived to be part of an international 'family' of companies
influenced or controlled by the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa.
The rest of the JM shares were placed with a wide range of institutions in
London yesterday for Pounds 154.6m or 456p a share by Barclays de Zoete Wedd
and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. After the announcement JM shares fell by 19p to
close at 473p while Charter's ended 28p down at 656p.
Analysts suggested there was some disappointment that Charter's disposal had
not sparked a bid for JM and that the platinum marketing company once again
would be virtually bid-proof.
It was widely expected that Charter would use most of the cash raised to buy
Minorco's 35.7 per cent stake in Charter and thus disentangle itself
completely from the Anglo web
Mr Jeff Herbert, Charter's managing director, said a buy-back was one
option. It had been established there would be no adverse tax implications
from this. However, no formal approach had been made to Minorco and any deal
would depend on Minorco's willingness to sell, and the price.
Analysts suggested that, with the removal of JM from Charter's portfolio,
there seemed to be no good reason for Minorco, which is 60 per cent-owned by
Anglo and its sister company De Beers, to retain its stake.
Minorco is paying Pounds 90.6m cash to Charter on completion but JCI will
pay in two equal tranches of Pounds 48.61m. In the negotiations Hambros
advised Charter; S G Warburg advised Minorco; Standard Merchant advised JCI;
and Baring Brothers advised JM.

FT  09 FEB 93 / State move boosts US gun control supporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US GUN control advocates believe they may have made an important
breakthrough with the likely passage of a law controlling handgun sales in
Virginia, one of the principal markets in the eastern US.
Mr Douglas Wilder, the state's governor, yesterday announced a compromise
bill that slightly eases his original proposal to limit buyers to one
handgun per month.
Mr Wilder, who campaigned briefly last year for the Democratic party's
presidential nomination, secured support from Republicans in the state
legislature by agreeing to allow people to buy more than one handgun a
month, provided they obrained a certificate from the state police.
The Virginia legislation is viewed as important since the state - because of
its very loose controls - has been a major source of guns used by criminals.
New York police have found than more than a quarter of weapons used in
crimes there originated in Virginia.
'This proposal will do the job to stop trafficking and proliferation of
handguns in our state,' said Mr Randolph Rollins, Virginia's secretary of
public safety.
But the 'one gun a month' approach is also attracting interest on the
national level, because its commonsense simplicity appears to have
confounded opponents of gun control.
Gun controls advocates have mostly worked on two types of restriction: a ban
on multiple shot automatic and semi-automatic weapons, and a mandatory
waiting period before a buyer can take a weapon home.
Legislation imposing such a waiting period passed Congress last year in a
comprehensive crime bill but was vetoed by President George Bush. It became
known as the Brady bill after Mr James Brady, the former White House press
secretary who was shot during an assassination attempt on President Ronald
Reagan in 1981.
Senator Howard Metzenbaum and Congressman Charles Schumer are expected to
reintroduce the Brady bill in Congress this month. President Bill Clinton
said during his election campaign that he would support the bill, as well as
a ban on semi-automatic assault weapons.
More than 90 per cent of those questioned in a recent Gallup poll favoured a
national waiting period, and support for an outright ban on handgun
possession, although still in a minority, has risen from 31 per cent to 43
per cent over the last decade.
The US criminal justice system is 'on a fast track to collapse' because of
excessive concentration on drug offences, the American Bar Association has
warned.
The ABA's criminal justice section reported that drug offences were pushing
other cases off court calendars and that long mandatory sentences ordered by
Congress were forcing states to release violent criminals to make room for
drug offenders.
The number of adult drug offenders in prison quadrupled between 1986 and
1991, six times as fast as other offences, while surveys indicated that the
proportion of the population using drugs fell from 12 per cent to 6 per
cent.

FT  09 FEB 93 / People: Avery, from Lloyds to Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Julian Avery, a solicitor with 20 years' experience in banking, has switched
from one Lloyds to another in his latest career move, becoming the latest of
a growing number of prominent business figures to throw in their lot with
the Lloyd's of London insurance market.
Avery, now 47, has been appointed executive chairman of Wellington Members'
Agency, where he will lead efforts to upgrade the services the agency offers
to the 600 Names whose affairs it handles.
Head of European mergers and acquisitions at Lloyds merchant bank from 1990
until last year, Avery has also had a close involvement with private
banking, especially in Paris where he headed Lloyds' subsidiary between 1986
and 1990.
That should be an ideal blend of experience for a job in which he will need
to persuade the wealthy that the time is right to join Lloyd's, as well as
helping out with efforts to attract corporate capital to the Lloyd's market.
Avery, like Wellington chairman Anthony Haynes who recruited him, is
optimistic about prospects and has himself recently become a Name at
Lloyd's. 'It is entirely appropriate for anyone who expresses confidence in
the market to become a Name,' says Avery.
But even if things don't go too well Avery has other experience that could
come in handy. In the early 1980s he held senior management positions at
Lloyds in Rio de Janeiro where he was closely involved in the Brazilian debt
crisis.

Julian Mounter, former director general and chief executive of Television
New Zealand, is to become president and chief executive of the Hong
Kong-based Star TV. Star beams five channels, including the BBC's World
Service Television, to 38 countries; two years after its launch, it is
available in 11.5m homes.
Cornish-born Mounter, 47, was a journalist on The Times for seven years and
has worked for London Weekend Television and the BBC.
At Television New Zealand, the old New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation,
Mounter pursued 'a policy of modernisation designed to succeed in a
deregulated market' and was involved in everything from telecommunications
to pay tv and video distribution.
But last year he decided 'after 30 years of work' to take a year off and
sail with his family. 'We crossed the Atlantic twice and spent time in the
Caribbean,' he says.
Mounter says he intends to pursue a policy of 'prudent expansion' at Star,
which is owned by Hutchvision, a 50-50 joint venture between Hutchison
Whampoa and a company controlled by Li Ka-shing and his family.
As well as being president of Star TV, Mounter will also be chief executive
of Media Assets, an independent company set up to explore programming
opportunities in Asian markets.
*****
The exit at the weekend of John O'Neill as executive chairman of
Silvermines, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, follows the
completion of the disposal of all the group's engineering activities, as
part of a restructuring which leaves the group with three electrical
companies in the UK and three investment properties in Ireland.
O'Neill resigned 'at his request' after almost five years in the post, and
is being replaced with a non-executive chairman Bob Morton, who joined the
board just three months ago. Morton is a chartered accountant and is
chairman of the Vistec group which supplies computer systems, software and
services. He has also been chairman of the Burgess Group, Norank Systems and
Hatfield Estates. He has a 6 per cent holding in Silvermines.
Other board changes include the appointment of Pat Dineen as vice-chairman,
and the co-option of George Russell as a non-executive director.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Time-Warner strikes first profit since takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIME-WARNER, the US media group, yesterday reported its first annual net
profit since the publishing group, Time, merged with entertainment company
Warner in 1989. It made Dollars 86m (Pounds 56.9m) in 1992, against a loss
of Dollars 99m in 1991.
Fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 68m, up from Dollars 45m in the same
period of 1991, thanks to higher operating profits at each of Time-Warner's
five divisions.
Time-Warner tries to concentrate Wall Street attention on its earnings
before interest, taxes, appreciation and amortisation, on the grounds that
its underlying performance is distorted both by its debt burden and by heavy
non-cash amortisation charges, which totalled more than Dollars 500m in both
1991 and 1992.
On this basis, profits rose 8 per cent in the fourth quarter, from Dollars
677m to Dollars 731m, and 11 per cent during the year, from Dollars 2.26bn
to Dollars 2.51bn. Revenues for the quarter totalled Dollars 3.72bn, against
Dollars 3.39bn, and for the year Dollars 13.07bn, against Dollars 12.02bn.
However, at earnings per share level, the company's profits translated into
losses. It reported a loss of 25 cents a share in the quarter, down from 29
cents a year ago, and a loss of Dollars 1.46 for the year, down from Dollars
2.40.
The group's publishing division reported operating profits of Dollars 132m
in the quarter (Dollars 124m), and Dollars 328m for 1992 (Dollars 246m).
The filmed entertainment division rose to Dollars 92m in the quarter
(Dollars 90m), and Dollars 410m for the year, up from Dollars 390m. The
company said strong US box office results from the films The Bodyguard and
Forever Young helped the quarter.

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: American Barrick to lift
dividend
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO, MONTREAL

<TEXT>
AMERICAN Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, has shrugged off the
lacklustre prospects for the yellow metal by raising its dividend and
announcing a two-for-one share split.
The semi-annual dividend is being increased to 4 US cents a share after the
share split, compared with 6.5 cents prior to the split. The share split
will take place by means of a special stock dividend, with each holder of a
common share on February 19 receiving another share on March 1.
Barrick defied the prevailing gloom in the gold industry last week by
announcing an 89 per cent jump in 1992 earnings, thanks largely to rising
production from its flagship Goldstrike mine in Nevada.
An active hedging programme has protected its earnings from the sliding gold
price.
Barrick's entire output until the end of 1994 is locked in at an average
price of more than USDollars 400 an ounce, compared with the current price
of USDollars 328.
Canadian Tires has reported that heavy price discounting, especially in the
fourth quarter, brought a 43 per cent drop in 1992 net profits, though
turnover rose by 8 per cent, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Other negative factors for the national hardware, sports goods and car parts
retailer, Canada's biggest franchise business, included losses on petrol
retailing and a CDollars 15m loss at its new US subsidiary.
Net profits for 1992 totalled CDollars 72.3m or 87 cents a share against
CDollars 127.1m or CDollars 1.41m a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars
3.2bn against CDollars 2.9bn.
Fourth-quarter profits equalled 3 cents a share, down from 29 cents a year
earlier.
Mitel, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker formerly controlled
by British Telecom, earned a small third-quarter profit but lost CDollars
9.3m or 15 cents a share on turnover of CDollars 305m for the first nine
months, writes Robert Gibbens. A year earlier the nine-month loss was
CDollars 10.7m on revenues of CDollars 285m. US sales improved and a lower
Canadian dollar is helping.
Dominion Textile, Canada's integrated textile group, plans to invest
CDollars 20m (USDollars 15.8m) including working capital in its Swift
Textiles denim manufacturing unit in Columbus, Georgia, Reuter reports from
Montreal.
The capital expenditure includes the addition of new looms and equipment
modifications, the company said.

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Marginal increase by Noble Grossart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBLE GROSSART, the small Edinburgh merchant bank co-founded and managed by
Mr Angus Grossart, increased its pre-tax profits marginally from Pounds
3.35m to Pounds 3.4m in the year to January 31 1993.
Mr Grossart said the bank had been extremely busy in all areas and the
client list continued to strengthen. Noble Grossart was involved in several
reshaping and restructuring exercises, he said.
He said it was 'consistent performance which matters in the financial sector
and those who soar in good times are often likely to be the first to plunge
in adversity. There are no short cuts in merchant banking.'
The bank does not reveal its turnover or fee income. The accounts show that
Noble Grossart's income from unlisted investments went down from Pounds
566,000 to Pounds 214,000.
Mr Grossart said that in a difficult climate for unlisted investments 'we
have no major current problems.'

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: SGS, Mitsubishi Electric discuss
flash-memory link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Electric, the Japanese electrical and electronics group, and
SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor joint venture, are negotiating
a possible tie-up in the development and manufacture of flash-memory chips,
Mitsubishi said.
The talks between Mitsubishi and SGS highlight the Franco-Italian group's
eagerness to move into the market at an early stage by securing a partner in
a stronger financial position than SGS and with proven competence in flash
technology.
Flash-memory chips, which retain information even when the power is switched
off, are expected eventually to replace disk drives and other magnetic
recording devices in portable electronic products.
The market for flash memories is estimated to grow to an annual value of
Dollars 1.5bn by 1995, according to Dataquest, the high-technology
consultancy.
The discussions between Mitsubishi and SGS are in line with the growing
industry trend to share the financial burden of research and development in
new technologies.
Intel, the US semiconductor manufacturer, and Sharp have already announced
joint development of flash technology. Toshiba, the inventor of flash, and
IBM are also joining forces to develop the technology, while Fujitsu and AMD
have agreed jointly to build a factory to manufacture flash-memory devices.
Mitsubishi has independently developed technology in flash-memory chips of
up to 16 megabits.
Although a tie-up with SGS would enable the company to share development
costs, Mitsubishi would have no difficulty continuing its development
efforts on its own, a Mitsubishi official said.
If joint development and manufacture were agreed, the connection would also
provide Mitsubishi with a route into the European market, the official
added.
Joining forces with Mitsubishi would provide SGS with much-needed funding
and would give it a route into the Japanese market, expected to be a major
source of demand for flash-memory chips.

FT  09 FEB 93 / 'Champagne' claim upheld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCO-BRITISH relations took a blow yesterday when French champagne
producers were defeated in a High Court case.
The champagne houses failed in an attempt to stop an English vineyard
marketing a sparkling non-alcoholic drink as 'Elderflower champagne'.
The court ruled that the drink produced by the Surrey-based company
Thorncroft and sold for Pounds 2.45 in champagne-style bottles with wired
corks was 'misrepresentation calculated to deceive'. But it concluded that
the damage to the reputation of genuine champagne would be nil or minimal.
'This is Waterloo brought up to date,' Sir Gerard Vaughan, Conservative MP
for Reading East, said of the ruling.
It is the first setback in the European Community to attempts by French
champagne producers to restrict the use of the appellation 'champagne' to
the sparkling wine produced in the Champagne region of France since the
fight with cidermaker Bulmer over calling Babycham 'champagne perry' in
1975.
Although the champagne producers lost that case in the Court of Appeal, the
matter was settled subsequently by negotiation in their favour before the
case was due to go before the law lords.
It comes only weeks after Hoover provoked widespread anger in France by
announcing it would shift all European vacuum cleaner production to
Cambuslang, near Glasgow, causing the loss of 650 jobs at its plant at
Longvic, near Dijon.
The champagne houses said they would appeal.
Mr Malcolm McIntyre, director of the Champagne Bureau, said: 'We are very
disappointed and I think this will cause some gnashing of teeth in Europe.
It is the thin end of the wedge.'
Mr Guy Woodall, Thorncroft's owner, said he was delighted with the decision.
'The spirit of Agincourt lives on,' he said.
The Leatherhead vineyard has been marketing its drink as 'Sparkling
Elderflower' since last April when the champagne producers obtained a
temporary injunction preventing it from calling the drink 'champagne'
pending a full court hearing.
Yesterday it was awarded costs estimated at Pounds 100,000, against the
champagne producers led by Taittinger and will be entitled to damages for
expenses caused by the temporary injunction, such as re-labelling.
The exclusive right to the champagne name was confirmed in this country in
the early 1960s when Spanish producers of sparkling wine were banned from
using it. French producers of champagne have taken legal action in many
countries in an attempt to protect the name, bringing 64 actions in the
English courts alone since the early 1960s.
Mr David Sills, solicitor for the champagne producers, said he was 'shocked
and dismayed' by the decision.
'The judge decided there had been misrepresentaton calculated to deceive yet
declined to give us a remedy.
'He also found there was a specific risk of confusion between the goods of
the two parties which is contrary to the 1987 European wine regulation which
says there must be no risk of confusion.
'He seems to have grafted the English requirement for there to be a
likelihood of damage to the plaintiff on to the European regulation,' he
said.

A MANUFACTURER of Elderflower champagne successfully resisted a challenge by
the French champagne industry in the High Court yesterday.
Thorncroft, a Surrey-based vineyard, will be allowed to go on marketing its
sparkling non-alcoholic drink as Elderflower champagne even though the court
ruled that the drink, sold in champagne-style bottles with wired corks, was
'misrepresentation calculated to deceive'.
But it concluded that the damage to the reputation of genuine champagne
would be nil or minimal.
Mr Guy Woodall (above left), Thorncroft's owner, and partner Mr Ray Bevan
toasted their triumph explosively - with Elderflower champagne.

ADollars 215m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the troubled Australian bank, has continued its
asset-sale programme by selling its once-strategic 6.1 per cent stake in the
rival ANZ Banking Group for just over ADollars 215m (USDollars 144.9m).
Westpac confirmed completion of the sale yesterday after the bank's brokers
began the selling task in New York on Friday night.
The bank has sold a total of 77.5m ANZ shares to a range of Australian and
overseas institutions.
The shares were sold at ADollars 2.905 each, yielding a small profit on
Westpac's book valuation of ADollars 2.88 following a big write-down last
year.
Westpac's major shareholder, the AMP Society, also revealed yesterday it had
sold just under 1m ANZ shares, but retained a stake of 5.71 per cent.
The ANZ sales come amid speculation that further leading bank mergers may be
allowed if the Liberal-National Party coalition wins Australia's federal
election, scheduled for March 13.
Westpac also announced last night it had sold its entire 7.6 per cent stake
in the Bank of Melbourne, a small Australian trading bank.

SUEZ, one of France's oldest industrial groups, and Pinault, the
fast-expanding retail concern, yesterday refused to comment on reports that
they are negotiating a cross-shareholding agreement, writes Alice Rawsthorn.
The two companies, according to a report in yesterday's edition of
Liberation newspaper, have for months been secretly discussing a deal
whereby Suez would take a 22 per cent stake in Pinault in return for buying
the latter's treasury stock and for ceding 5 per cent of its own shares.
Pinault, which is trying to raise capital to reduce the debts incurred in
its recent acquisitions, said it had 'absolutely no comment' to make on the
issue. Suez, an old-established force in French finance and industry under
pressure because of the Paris property crisis, also declined to comment.
However, a Suez spokesman did not deny that the group was in discussions
with Pinault.

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Provisions cut Bryant to Pounds 7.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRYANT GROUP, the West Midlands-based construction company, confirmed
yesterday that consumer confidence was improving and that there were signs
of re-kindled purchaser interest in new homes.
The announcement accompanied the group's interim results, which showed that
pre-tax profits had fallen from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 7.5m for the half year
to November 30.
Bryant is the latest housebuilder to suggest that the combination of low
interest rates, falling prices and 'the favourable affordability ratio,' is
tempting buyers to return to the market.
Mr Andrew MacKenzie, chief executive, said the company had seen 'a 30 per
cent year-on-year increase in both visitors and net house reservations' in
the last two months.
These early signs of recovery were strongest in the south-east, but had also
begun to feed through to the Midlands, he said.
Despite depressed market conditions last year, Bryant's housebuilding
division managed to perform well helping the group to maintain operating
profits in the opening half at Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 10.9m) on turnover which
fell by 15 per cent from Pounds 163.5m to Pounds 138.4m.
However, a Pounds 1.9m loss in the group's associated undertakings, which
mainly reflected Pounds 1.5m in provisions against the group's interest in
property developments in Dublin and Birmingham, was behind the fall in
profits at the pre-tax level.
Total provisions of Pounds 3.5m included Pounds 1m against assets in each of
the property and housing divisions.
Earnings per share fell to 1.9p (2.5p). However, based on the more positive
outlook the interim dividend is maintained at 1.4p.
In the first half the homes division increased sales by almost 5 per cent to
Pounds 100.9m (Pounds 96.3m) and operating profits from Pounds 7.9m to
Pounds 8.7m.
The number of house completions jumped by more than 13 per cent to 1,290.
Turnover in the property division fell to Pounds 7.1m (Pounds 10.8m)
reflecting the harsh trading environment in both the UK and Ireland.
The division incurred an operating loss of Pounds 600,000 (profit Pounds
300,000).
The group said it planned to further reduce the level of its investment in
property.
Turnover in the construction side of Pounds 30.8m (Pounds 57.1m) was in line
with expectations and operating profits of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2.7m)
reflected a number of settlements related to old contracts.
The division continued to reject work where margins were inadequate.
COMMENT
Bryant's upbeat market assessment, following similar optimistic noises from
other builders, helped the shares jump 7p to 124p yesterday. Despite the
recession and falling prices the management has succeeded in maintaining
housebuilding volumes and margins, while making prudent provisions where
necessary. The balance sheet shows group borrowings of Pounds 9.3m,
representing gearing of 5 per cent, a level which will enable the group to
fund land purchases to support its expanding regional house-building
activities. Of more concern are the Pounds 52m of associated companies'
borrowings, some Pounds 20m of which are attributable to Bryant but which
are due to decline. Providing there are no surprise provisions pre-tax
profits should reach about Pounds 17m this year and Pounds 25m next. But
with earnings this year of about 4.4p the recent run-up in the share price
makes even this quality stock look expensive. Nevertheless, it is a buy on
signs of price weakness.

AXA, the French insurance group, yesterday launched FFr3.65bn (Dollars 663m)
of convertible bonds to strengthen the capital position of the group and
some of its subsidiaries, writes Richard Waters.
The seven-year bonds, FFr741m of which have been placed internationally, are
convertible into Axa shares at FFr1,285 each. This represents a 12.7 per
cent premium to yesterday's closing price of FFr1,140, which was recorded
before the issue was announced.
Axa has the right to call the bonds, which carry a coupon of 6 per cent and
yield to maturity of 7.5 per cent, at any time from the beginning of 1996.
The existing majority shareholders of the group, which control 50.9 per
cent, will retain control after the offering. Existing shareholders are
being offered one convertible for every 11 shares held, with a priority
period to apply before 22 February.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Trinidad wages warning angers state workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Trinidad and Tobago is facing a public protest over its
inability to make payments to public sector workers while attempting to meet
foreign debt obligations.
Thousands of government workers have been protesting in Port of Spain,
capital of the English-speaking Caribbean republic, and unions are
threatening further action which could cripple the economy. The actions
follow statements by the finance minister that retrenchment in the public
sector was inevitable. Union leaders have said more protests are likely this
week.
The protests started when Mr Wendell Mottley, the finance minister, said
that falling international oil prices, the external debt and a high wage
bill meant that the government could no longer postpone retrenchment in
inefficient public companies. 'Inevitably, the painful matter of separation
of a significant number of workers will arise. It is an issue that we just
cannot postpone further,' Mr Mottley said.
He said foreign debt obligations and the government's commitments on wages
and salaries could not both be met at the same time.
The government has said it would have to take 'tough decisions' on whether
it could afford payment of TTDollars 3bn (USDollars 705m) in arrears due to
government workers. Union leaders have been incensed by plans to cut
thousands of jobs from three public companies - the port authority, the
water authority and the transport company.
Mr Mottley said the port authority's monthly revenue was TTDollars 5.7m,
while pensions and wages cost TTDollars 10.2m per month. The transport
company earned TTDollars 30m last year while paying TTDollars 86m in wages
and the water authority last year paid wages of TTDollars 157m while earning
TTDollars 134m.

<TEXT>
Two British men have been found dead in Bosnia, the UK Foreign Office said
yesterday, AP reports. The men were reportedly mercenaries training Moslem
troops in the area of Travnik, about 70km north-west of Sarajevo.
A Foreign Office spokesman said it had asked the United Nations and the
International Red Cross for details about the men, whose identities were not
known. Reports suggest they were taken from their apartment in Travnik and
driven to Turbe, a village 10km to the west. Major Martin Waters of the
British forces in nearby Vitez said they were found tied up with gunshot
wounds to the head.

Industrial conflict is threatening Denmark following the breakdown yesterday
of negotiations for a new two-year collective wage agreement between
employers and trade unions representing 200,000 workers in manufacturing
industry, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
The employers are seeking a no-increase agreement, which the unions have
rejected. But there is a complex mediation system which would delay any
strike moves for several weeks.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Czechs and Slovaks agree bilateral payments accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Czech and Slovak parliaments approved a payments clearing accord - just
in time for yesterday's introduction of separate currencies.
As from yesterday the Czechoslovak koruna (crown) has been abolished to make
way for separate Czech and Slovak crowns. Initially, these will be
differently stamped old banknotes as the new national ones are gradually
introduced. The Czech republic and Slovakia continued to share the same
currency after the split of the former Czechoslovak state on January 1 this
year. Old banknotes are no longer valid except for small denominations.
The clearing accord aims to provide a stable framework for trade between the
two states, though bilateral trade is expected to decline as each country
seeks new markets.
On the domestic front, dividing up assets is proving a contentious issue,
made more difficult by the introduction of separate currencies and the
expectation of a Slovak crown devaluation. Czechs and Slovaks are currently
locked in dispute over who owes what.
Mr Ivan Kocarnic, the Czech finance minister, said at the weekend Slovak
banks borrowed 25bn crowns (Dollars 860m) more from the former Czechoslovak
National Bank than their Czech counterparts and this will need to be repaid.
He said payment could be made over a 10-year period. One way would be for
Slovakia to waive transit fees on Czech imports of Siberian gas distributed
by a pipeline running across its territory.
The division of gold reserves and the national banks' foreign securities
assets are also controversial issues. Agreement has been stalled because of
a dispute over 7.3 tonnes of gold which Bratislava says were taken by Prague
at the end of the second world war when the short-lived Nazi-backed Slovakia
was brought back into a unified Czechoslovakia.
The Czech government will accept the transit across its territory of east
European refugees expelled from Germany only if Bonn can guarantee that they
will not remain stranded in the Czech republic, Mr Jan Ruml, the Czech
interior minister, said at the weekend.

FT  09 FEB 93 / How Lamont's advisers would lead Britain out of recession
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FREE MARKET EVANGELIST
Patrick Minford
Economics professor, Liverpool University
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEREST RATES
Wants to see base rates cut by 3 percentage points to 3 per cent by
mid-March, and staying at around that rate until the end of year if
there is no sign of clear revival.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
TAX INCREASES
Not in favour. Wants tax cuts in the medium term to help incentives.
Believes high public sector borrowing requirement is largely due to the
recession.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INFLATION TARGET
Treasury's target of keeping underlying inflation below 4 per cent will
'quite probably' be breached this year, due to effects of devaluation.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ERM RE-ENTRY
Opposes ERM re-entry at any time, on any terms.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
PUBLIC SPENDING
Favours cuts over next few years, together with reforms based on
charging for specific services such as health and education.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ECONOMIC GROWTH
On worst case, economy could contract by 0.5 per cent this year. At
best, could expand by 0.5 per cent. Longer-term, he is optimistic about
growth prospects.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
FORECASTING RECORD
Came 4th out of 41 forecasting groups in FT survey of accuracy of growth
predictions during recession.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
UNEMPLOYMENT
Thinks unemployment will peak in late 1993 at 3.25m, assuming further
cuts in interest rates.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
CHALLENGE FOR THE 1990S
Continuation of reforms started by Thatcher governments.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE CULTIVATED CASSANDRA
Wynne Godley
Professor of applied economics, Cambridge University
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEREST RATES
Unsure about whether more action is needed after last month's cut to
6 per cent. At end of last year called for immediate cut to 5 per cent.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
TAX INCREASES
Does not want to specify a view. He believes high government deficits
may not necessarily be a problem.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INFLATION TARGET
Inflation might 'nudge' government target this year.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ERM RE-ENTRY
Not unless system is reformed.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
PUBLIC SPENDING
Not willing to provide a view.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Last December projected 0.5 per cent growth this year, picking up to
1.5 per cent next year.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
FORECASTING RECORD
Unranked in FT survey because insufficient forecasts; since early 1991
has had good record in predicting lengthy recession.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
UNEMPLOYMENT
Generally gloomy about prospects. Thinks figures could climb above
3.4m in 1994.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
CHALLENGE FOR THE 1990S
UK to sell goods and services on world markets more successfully than
in the past.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE UNBENDING MONETARIST
Tim Congdon
Managing director, Lombard Street Research
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEREST RATES
In December he forecast a 6.5 per cent base rate by the end of 1993.
Does not want to say where he thinks rates should be.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
TAX INCREASES
Wants a tax increase of about pounds 12bn announced in March 16 Budget,
spread over income tax, National Insurance contributions and indirect
taxes. 'Very worried' by rise in government deficit.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INFLATION TARGET
Government target may be exceeded briefly this year, but he thinks
inflation is on a downward trend in 1994 and 1995, assuming 'sensible'
policies and use of broad-money targets.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ERM RE-ENTRY
Never.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
PUBLIC SPENDING
Wants 'significant cuts' in next few years.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ECONOMIC GROWTH
1 per cent growth likely this year. Thinks conditions for a lasting
recovery are in place, though much depends on world economic conditions.

FORECASTING RECORD
8th in FT survey.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
UNEMPLOYMENT
Likely to peak at 3.3m in the first half of next year.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

To reconcile steady growth at trend rate without inflation. Over next
year government must act to stop disintegration of financial system by
debt inflation.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ENTHUSIASTIC NUMBER-CRUNCHER
Andrew Sentance
Economics director, Confederation of British Industry
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEREST RATES
Wait and see before cutting again. Hopes for lower interest rates over
the next few years.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
TAX INCREASES
May be needed, especially if consumer spending looks like growing too
quickly.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INFLATION TARGET
Will not be exceeded 'in any serious way' this year.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ERM RE-ENTRY
Not until economy growing again and conditions in rest of Europe more
settled.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
PUBLIC SPENDING
Cuts may be needed, especially if PSBR goes too high.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ECONOMIC GROWTH
0.7 per cent likely this year.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
FORECASTING RECORD
11th in FT survey.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
UNEMPLOYMENT
Rise to 3.2m by end of 1994.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
CHALLENGE FOR THE 1990s
To reduce unemployment and speed up growth without higher current
account deficit
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE MAN FOR ALL PARTIES
Gavyn Davies
Chief UK economist, Goldman Sachs
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEREST RATES
Hopes to see cut to 5 per cent by late spring, possibly 4 per cent later
to boost recovery hopes.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
TAX INCREASES
Wants to see roughly pounds 12bn in tax increases, to take effect in
1994-95 rather than in 1993-94 so as not to stall recovery. Chancellor
could announce tax rises in March 16 budget.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INFLATION TARGET
Inflation not the key problem facing Britain.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ERM RE-ENTRY
Premature to say, as system may not survive.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
PUBLIC SPENDING
Unwilling to specify views, but forecasts assume little change to
government plans.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Growth of 1.5 per cent predicted for this year.

7th in FT survey.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Likely to rise to 3.25m and stay at this level for some years.

investment, labour market, training and education.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE BUSINESS GURU
David Currie
Head of economic forecasting, London Business School
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEREST RATES
In favour of generally lower base rates but thinks they might need to
rise later this year if higher prices from devaluation start to feed
through to wage claims.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
TAX INCREASES
May be needed due to high PSBR.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INFLATION TARGET
May be breached over the next two years, though this is not of serious
concern.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ERM RE-ENTRY
Unlikely in immediate future.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
PUBLIC SPENDING
Large cuts unlikely in the near future, due to the pressure on priority
areas.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
FORECASTING RECORD
31st in FT survey.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
UNEMPLOYMENT
Likely to remain high, falling only slightly below 3m in 1996.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
CHALLENGE FOR THE 1990s
Not willing to specify.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE CONSENSUS-MINDED THEORIST
Andrew Britton
Director, National Institute of Economic and Social Research
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INTEREST RATES
After the recent cut, wants to wait for more signs of economic activity
before further activity.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
TAX INCREASES
Not in favour of precipitate action. Thinks 'scare stories' about large
PSBR may be overdone.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
INFLATION TARGET
A 'clear risk' of 1 to 4 per cent target being breached this year.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ERM RE-ENTRY
Decision should be postponed until view becomes clearer of how system
will evolve.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
PUBLIC SPENDING
Thinks spending might overshoot government targets in coming years, in
which case some tax increases might be needed.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
ECONOMIC GROWTH
Sticking to forecast of about 2 per cent growth this year.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
FORECASTING RECORD
36th in FT survey.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
UNEMPLOYMENT

<TEXT>
With unemployment in the UK nearing 3m it is time for a fundamental re-think
of policy. For we now know that high unemployment is not a temporary
problem. It is a permanent scar on Britain's present economic structures.
Since 1986 the number of people out of work has averaged 2.4m. Inflation now
is the same as in 1986, so this means that, as things are, the government
cannot control inflation with fewer then 2.4m unemployed. That is the
horrible truth that needs addressing.
First, a policy is needed which will prevent long-term unemployment (of more
than one year). On most evidence long-term unemployment does nothing to
prevent inflationary wage pressures, so it is a total waste. The long-term
unemployed cease to be part of the effective supply of labour since they
become of no interest to employers. This imposes a huge cost on taxpayers
and companies, as well as on the unemployed themselves.
Unemployment now costs the economy roughly Pounds 60bn, of which Pounds 24bn
is borne by taxpayers, Pounds 12bn by lost profits and Pounds 24bn by the
unemployed. Long-term unemployment accounts for about a third of the total.
To prevent long-term unemployment requires adopting an 'active labour market
policy' of the kind recommended by the OECD and practised in Sweden, even by
its new Conservative government.
The principle is that, if people want to work, they should be helped to be
employable. And no one should be left to rot in idleness for more than a
year with no offer of useful work.
An active labour market policy for Britain would have the following
elements:
Job Centres would provide for each unemployed person a personal placement
officer, who would ensure that every client received training or a job offer
within a year.
Training would be of better quality than at present (Sweden spends the same
on an unemployed trainee as on a university student).
If a person gets no offer of regular work within a year, he or she must be
offered temporary work. This should be with a regular employer and be paid
at the standard hourly rate for the job. A low-quality 'workfare' scheme,
where workers get benefit 'plus', would be a real mistake. Workers need the
self-respect which goes with a normal job paid at the normal rate. If funds
are stretched, the job could in the last resort be part-time. There is
little point keeping people off the unemployment register if they are doing
nothing useful. Poor-quality schemes are unlikely to be justified. What is
done now should be part of a long-term plan, constructing a system which
will prevent long-term unemployment.
Details of such a plan have been outlined in a pamphlet by John Philpott and
myself*. International evidence suggests that such a system could reduce
Britain's unemployment permanently by about 0.75m. In due course it would
pay for itself through lower benefits and higher tax receipts.
A complete system could not be fully in place much before 2000. But now is
the time to start. The proposed 250,000 temporary jobs should be a step on
the way.
Second, a rethink on youth training is needed. At least two-thirds of
British workers have no professional or vocational qualification - compared
with only a quarter in Germany. No wonder so many find it difficult to get
jobs.
If Britain follows the German example it should:
finance all vocational education and training from collective sources (taxes
or levies);
require that all young people in employment are employed as trainees, with
at least one day a week off-the-job training.
Improving the quality of labour will do much to reduce inflationary
pressures. But, point three, Britain must also improve its anarchic system
of wage determination. As soon as there is a recovery, wage settlements will
rise again, as they did after 1986. The country will be into the same old
cycle. Business, in its own interest, should deal with this problem by
contriving a more co-ordinated approach to wage determination, analogous to
Germany's. But this will not happen without government encouragement.
In this connection everyone in Britain should be watching Germany, to see
how it handles infinitely greater problems than Britain has ever had to
face. You can be sure that western Germany will control its inflation with
fewer than 3m unemployed. So should Britain.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Time to tilt the balance: UK pension funds are under growing
pressure to increase their holdings of bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the turn of the year Britain's pension fund trustees have been weighed
down by an awesome volume of paper from City analysts on the relative merits
of equities and bonds. Nearly 80 per cent of their Pounds 350bn portfolio is
invested in equities - a higher proportion than in any other industrialised
country. The question is whether the people who hold the nation's retirement
prospects in their hands are dangerously over-exposed, when inflation poses
a diminished threat to bond values.
At first sight it may seem an odd question to raise when equity markets
across the world are soaring on the back of falling interest rates. Yet for
trustees the decline in dividend yields resulting from rising prices can be
bad news, since actuaries value pension fund investments on the basis not of
stock market values, but potential income streams. And with the equity
market yield down to 4 1/4 per cent, against the 8 3/4 per cent available at
the long end of the gilt-edged market, the bond-equity debate is very much
alive.
The following tour d'horizon of the arguments suggests no simple answers,
bar one: the percentage of UK pension fund portfolios devoted to bonds is
bound to rise. In a recent review of the debate, Sushil Wadhwani and Mushtaq
Shah of investment bank Goldman Sachs point out that there has been a
positive correlation between the bond weighting in portfolios and the public
sector borrowing requirement (see chart). A PSBR approaching 9 per cent of
GDP next year will exert an upward pull on bond weightings, though a less
powerful one than in the days of exchange controls.
The maturity of pension schemes is pushing in the same direction. Between
1967 and 1987 the number of pensioners increased as a percentage of all the
members of UK pension schemes from 19 per cent to 57 per cent. If mature
funds are obliged to sell investments to pay pensions, liquidity in the
shape of cash and gilts becomes important.
As the yield curve has steepened, with short interest rates falling faster
than long rates, cash looks unattractive to funds that worry about
short-term performance. The question, then, is simply the price at which
pension funds increase their bond holdings. Do gilt yields provide adequate
compensation against the risk of resurgent inflation? Put the other way,
will the rising stream of future dividend income adequately compensate for
the extra income foregone in gilts, after allowing for the additional risk
inherent in equity investment?
The extreme aversion of British pension fund trustees to gilts derives some
support from history. According to a study by BZW, the UK investment bank,
of the performance of equities and gilts since 1918, equities produced an
average annual real return over the past 74 years of 7.3 per cent, compared
with a dismal 1.2 per cent on gilts and 1 per cent on cash. On that basis an
investor looking for maximum long-term return without regard to risk or
income requirements would have done best to hold equities exclusively. It
follows that, before fund managers substantially boost their gilt holdings,
they have to convince themselves of the existence of a historical watershed.
Is it possible, for example, that equities and gilts are mispriced?
This has certainly happened before. In the 1940s and 1950s the conventional
wisdom in the rarefied world of the actuarial profession was that equities
were so risky that they should yield more than fixed-interest gilts. Yet the
value of gilts bought at that time was destroyed by unanticipated inflation.
Today it is easy to make a case that global inflation has been laid low by a
combination of central bank rigour, persistent output gaps in the developed
world economies and the emergence of a global labour market, all of which
exert downward pressure on prices. Yet real rates of interest are above
their postwar average, which suggests that the markets' inflation
expectations are based more on past experience than on future probability.
Over the past two years that has amounted to a powerful global case for
buying bonds. In the UK the argument is complicated by the sorry record of
the Treasury and the Bank of England in monetary policy and exchange rate
management. But the market knows about the record; and in a debt-burdened
economy in which pay settlements are moderating fast as unemployment soars,
many analysts feel that the market's expectation of 5 per cent inflation
(the long gilt yield minus the yield on index-linked gilts) is excessive.
Consider the equity side of the equation. It is widely accepted that
dividend growth holds the key to future share price performance. Adding
BZW's historic rate of real dividend growth of about 1 3/4 per cent - close
to growth in GDP - to today's equity market yield of 4 1/4 per cent points
to a real equity return of 6 per cent. That looks good compared with the
real 3 3/4 per cent available on index-linked gilts, or on long-dated gilts
after 5 per cent inflation.
Looking at nominal dividend growth, as Paul Walton of stockbrokers James
Capel did in a recent exercise, throws up similar results. A survey of
leading companies and fund managers showed that the expectation of
medium-term dividend growth was 6 per cent; and an examination of the
ability of leading companies to pay dividends appeared to support the
finding. Given that most actuarial valuations assume a 5 per cent dividend
growth rate, this looks reassuring.
But the assumptions can readily be attacked. For a start, few company
analysts are making any allowance in their forecasts for the increasingly
plausible threat of a sharp deterioration in global trade relations. And it
is becoming all too easy to paint low-growth, low-inflation scenarios for
the world and for Britain. One of the more cogent comes from Brian Reading
of Lombard Street Research, whose latest monthly review suggests that in a
world of structural budget deficits, undercapitalised banks and overborrowed
companies and consumers, we might even see falling prices by the mid-1990s.
He also points out that in the three decades before the first world war
inflation averaged less than 1 per cent in the industrialised countries.
As far as dividends are concerned, perceptions may have been over-influenced
by the freakishly high payouts of the 1980s. In a recent paper to the
Institute of Actuaries, Peter Jones of James Capel pointed out that the
period of handsome outperformance by equities against gilts happened before
1958 when dividend yields fell below gilt yields - the emergence of the
so-called 'rev-erse yield gap'. With lower dividend expectations than in the
1980s he expects the equity risk premium - the excess return of equities
over gilts - to be lower than at any time in seven decades. A point in
support of the anti-equity case is that real dividend growth, using a
three-year moving average, was negative from 1962 to 1982 (see chart).
But perhaps the most difficult hurdle for equity investors is simply the
demanding starting point of a 4 1/4 per cent yield. Just how difficult it is
to outperform from a historically low yield base has been demonstrated in an
in-house study by Daniel O'Shea of the M&amp;G unit trust group, using BZW's
figures up to 1990. This set out to measure the average annual return on
equities over five-year periods, dividing the years into those where the
starting point was below the average long-term average yield of 4.7 per
cent, and those where it was above. The results showed, inter alia, that 65
per cent of the time, when the starting point was below that 4.7 yield, the
return on equities was below 3 per cent in real terms. Three per cent is
traditionally regarded as the century-in/century-out real return on
risk-free bonds. Note, too, that today's yield level is lower than it looks,
because of the addition of high-yield utilities to the market in the past
decade. So the equity odds are tougher as the bull market continues.
In investment, timing is all. But most fund managers are not in the business
of maximising returns. To keep their jobs, they seek whatever modest degree
of outperformance is compatible with the behaviour of the herd. The one safe
conclusion is that, if this really is the decade of the bond in Britain,
most fund managers will be late to act on it.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Punitive damages
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS has been ordered by an American jury to pay punitive damages
of Dollars 101m, on top of Dollars 4.2m compensation for pain and suffering,
to the parents of a 17-year-old boy who died when his GM pick-up truck
crashed and burst into flames. His parents claimed that faulty design and
placement of the fuel tank caused their son's death. The case, broadcast
live on television, has highlighted in a dramatic way the long-running
battle between business and consumer groups over the future of America's
civil liability system.
Industry has long argued that the US product-liability system has itself
become a liability to the economy. Businesses claim it discourages
innovation and dampens competitiveness. Consumer groups counter that the
threat of lawsuits and huge damages forces companies to make safer products.
Industry has powerful arguments on its side. A recent Brookings Institute
study of the impact of lawsuits on safety and innovation in five industries
concluded litigation was not 'an overwhelming driving force for safety' and
that uncertainty over damages awards had 'probably reduced innovation'.
The key to reform lies in replacing the patchwork of state laws with a
uniform federal liability code which would create standards for awarding
punitive damages. The latest attempt to introduce reform along these lines
failed to pass Congress in 1991. This was a pity, because a uniform approach
is clearly desirable. It would eliminate the uncertainty in the present
system, help to lower litigation costs by promoting settlements, and foster
innovation. The business lobby claimed the bill was pro-consumer because it
would encourage speedier pay-outs and unclog the courts. Consumer groups
said it would deter people from suing. Now business fears that, with the
Clinton administration likely to be more pro-plaintiff, the chance for
reform may have gone.
One window of opportunity remains. The US Supreme Court has recently
accepted a punitive damages case for review, in which it will be asked to
rule whether excessive punitive awards are unconstitutional. This is the
fifth time the Court has considered the issue, and it has yet to uphold a
single challenge. But on the last occasion in 1991, the Court said a
punitive award four times bigger than the compensatory damages awarded was
'close to the line of constitutional impropriety'. In the case to be
reviewed, the punitive damages were 526 times the compensatory award. All
businesses selling products in the US market must hope the Court will now
recognise that punitive damages in America have gone too far.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOOLS IN England and Wales are caught in a whirlwind. They have never
known a period of more rapid change. The cry is going up: 'enough, no more',
with teachers focusing their resentment on the first compulsory tests for
14-year-olds, to be sat this June.
Two of the teachers' unions are proposing to boycott the tests, arguing that
preparation has been inadequate and disruption will be too great. This is
deplorable. The only casualties of a boycott will be pupils. But the
government should listen to the well-founded concerns of teachers. It could
make the pace of change more manageable without sacrificing the laudable
object of its curriculum reforms: higher standards, particularly in basic
skills.
Three separate gusts are howling through the classroom. Curriculum reform,
accompanied by compulsory tests at seven, 11 and 14, is just the first.
Second is the government's campaign to persuade schools to opt out of local
authority control. Third is the new inspection regime, which will make all
schools subject to regular external monitoring.
Although the first is generating most noise at the moment, it cannot be seen
in isolation. Schools are also having to come to grips with devolved
budgeting; and many have either opted for grant-maintained status, or are
locked in internal debate about whether to do so. They will soon face visits
from the new inspectorate.
Curriculum reform comes on top of that. To take just secondary-level
English, the main cause of the present unrest, teachers have had to get the
national curriculum off the ground in the last three years; this year they
also have to cope both with the precipitate abolition of most GCSE
coursework and with the compulsory tests for 14-year-olds, materials for
which have only just reached them.
Overload alone should counsel restraint. One of the chief concerns among
English teachers is that publication of this year's test results will say
more about the relative success of schools in digesting mountains of
last-minute paper from the government's examinations council than anything
else.
It is important not to strengthen the more Luddite teachers' unions, who
want to undermine the current testing policy. But for education secretary
John Patten's reforms to succeed, he needs the wholehearted co-operation of
his workforce. Conceded with good grace, a year's delay in publishing the
English test results implies no weakening of his commitment to testing. If
it will secure teacher goodwill, it is a small price to pay for peace in the
classroom.

Early days yet, but Observer's request for samples of Swiss humour has led
to an avalanche of suggestions, most of them printable. This week will
therefore be Observer's Swiss joke week.
A Swiss financier has passed on the tale about the late Avery Brundage, a
famous president of the International Olympic Committee. God greets Brundage
on arrival in heaven and says that since he's been such a good chap he can
have a second life. God is a little surprised when Brundage asks if he can
return as a banker, but let's it pass without comment.
'Any particular bank in mind?' asks God.
'The Swiss Volksbank,' replies Brundage.
'Why Swiss Volksbank rather than the chairmanship of one of the Big three
Swiss banks?' asks God.
Back comes the reply. 'It's easy. All my life I have wanted to work with
real amateurs.'

Good to see that the six-week Bolshoi ballet season at London's Albert Hall
has been a great success after all. More than 80 per cent of the seats have
been sold and promoter Derek Block and Bolshoi director Yury Grigorovich
stand to pocket a Pounds 1m plus profit.
The Albert Hall's new commercially-minded management is also happy - even
though it decided to minimise its risk by renting the hall out for a fixed
amount rather than a share of the take. It has proved to the world that the
Hall doesn't just have to rely on the BBC proms for big commercial
successes.
The only possible grumblers are the 300 debenture holders who control close
to a third of the 5,200 seats. They sacrificed a chance to watch 34 of the
37 Bolshoi performances so that their seats could be sold to the public.
The consolation is that if the Albert Hall continues to make surpluses,
which, as a charity, must be ploughed back into improving the venue, it does
raise the value of the debentures. They rarely appear on the market but the
last box to be sold three years ago changed hands for Pounds 320,000, a good
return on the original, 1871, investment of Pounds 25 a seat.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiny Rowland's affection for Africa is well documented. It looks, however,
as if Dieter Bock, the mysterious German financier who is set to join
Lonrho's board this week, also knows his way around the Cape.
Bock is reported to be one of the key investors in a lucrative package of
land which links Cape Town's enormously successful waterfront development
with the city centre. Local property developers have for years been trying
to unlock the potential of the old power station/Imperial Cold Storage site.
However, it seems that Bock, with the help of a young entrepreneur called
Neil Bernstein, has outmanoeuvred the local property establishment and now
controls one of the prize property sites in Cape Town.
Details of Bock's Cape property interests, like the rest of his business
affairs, remain sketchy but they suggest that Tiny has spotted a businessman
with the same sort of capacity as himself for doing deals.
Meanwhile, don't imagine that Tiny himself has said goodbye to the African
stage. There are persistent rumours in Southern Africa that he is going to
continue to expand his newspaper interests by helping support a planned ANC
daily newspaper.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Observer: Gatwick flyer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So you think buying a railway ticket will get more complicated after British
Rail's privatisation? You should try buying one today from London to Gatwick
Airport.
As things stand, you can choose between two types of train for the journey:
InterCity's non-stop Gatwick Express, taking 30 minutes, or a Network
SouthEast suburban train taking four minutes longer. British Rail charges
exactly the same fare whichever train you choose - Pounds 8.60 for the
one-way journey - so everyone takes the Gatwick Express.
But wait: Pounds 8.60 is much more than you would normally expect to pay for
a 27-mile trip on Network SouthEast. And indeed, on examining the fare
table, you find that the fare from London to Three Bridges, the next station
down the line, is only Pounds 6.70. In other words, British Rail is
artificially bumping up the Network SouthEast fare to Gatwick to protect its
InterCity revenues.
The thrifty solution would clearly be to take a Pounds 6.70 ride on the
Network SouthEast train to Three Bridges and get off a station early, thus
saving Pounds 1.90. BR says this is unlawful, so you would get into trouble
if a ticket inspector caught you. However, the determined cheapskate can
legitimately save 70p by taking a Pounds 6.70 trip to Three Bridges and
booking another ticket there for the Pounds 1.20 trip back up the line to
Gatwick.
All this, of course, will change with privatisation. In all probability, the
Network SouthEast service and Gatwick Express will be operated by competing
franchisees, so this nonsense about fixing the fares will cease and
budget-conscious travellers will swarm to the cheaper service. A pity
really, considering the Gatwick Express is just about BR's only profitable
passenger service. Clearly a case of caveat emptor.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Filling the fiscal hole
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT DOES NOT take a genius to spot that the British government is in a spot
of bother over its growing budget deficit. Only now is the scale of damage
done to the government's finances in the last few years becoming apparent.
The forthcoming budget provides an opportunity for the government to outline
a credible programme for medium-term fiscal consolidation. Credibility
requires the government to acknowledge that tax increases, as well as
spending cuts, are necessary. Only then might the government's
anti-inflationary promises be believed.
The lingering recession that the government's erstwhile exchange rate
policy, and slow world economic growth, have bequeathed is partly to blame
for the dramatic deterioration in Britain's public finances over the past
year. But only partly. The OECD, in an otherwise friendly report on the UK
economy, blames the recession for only 70 per cent of the rise in the
deficit. The 1991 Autumn Statement's pre-election increases in public
spending, combined with cuts in corporation tax rates, make up the
difference.
On the assumption of growth of 2.4 per cent next year and unchanged fiscal
policies, the OECD estimates that the general government budget deficit
would be 6 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product in 1994, while the
cyclically adjusted deficit would be over 3 per cent. The Institute for
Fiscal Studies is prepared to peer further into the future. Assuming growth
of 3 per cent a year from 1993-94 onwards, its Green Budget forecasts the
public sector borrowing requirement will be Pounds 54bn in 1993-94, which is
8.75 per cent of GDP, and remain over Pounds 50bn until 1998. If the trade
constraint restrains growth to half that rate, then the PSBR could reach
Pounds 83bn.
Even the more optimistic growth scenario means a growing burden of debt
interest payments on future taxpayers. By the second half of the 1990s, when
interest payments on public debt are expected to be 4 per cent of GDP,
stabilising the ratio of gross debt to GDP would require a budget deficit of
only 3 per cent of GDP, half the level the IFS expects.
In short, the British government must plan to cut its structural budget
deficit by the equivalent of about Pounds 20bn a year in current prices if
it is to prevent a spiralling rise in the ratio of government debt and
interest payments. Part of that saving must come from constraining the
growth of public spending below that of GDP. But the scope for substantial
public spending cuts in the short term is limited, as chief secretary to the
Treasury Michael Portillo acknowledged yesterday. The financial markets will
probably be unwilling to absorb gilts on the scale that the government must
sell, in the hope that the spending review will come to the rescue. They are
more likely to demand punishingly high interest rates on British government
securities to cover the inflationary risk.
The government must reassure the markets by acknowledging that reducing the
fiscal gap will require higher taxes over the next two years. If required,
it should balance a credible commitment to fiscal tightening, with a further
cut in short-term interest rates in order to ensure that recovery arrives as
soon as possible.
Whether the government, and the current chancellor, can credibly promise
non-inflationary export-led growth is debatable. But the longer it waits
before acting, and the more cautious its statements in the meantime, the
deeper will be the fiscal hole from which the UK has to climb.
This is the second in a series of leaders on the March Budget.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Letter: The realistic way to offer prospect of jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ASHBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report that President Bill Clinton is now carrying through his
election commitment to introduce a new 'safety net' of welfare programmes,
on the basis that there must be 'a certain time beyond which people don't
draw a cheque for doing nothing' ('Clinton promises welfare task-force',
February 3). In the same edition, a letter from Mr O'Driscoll ('A more
realistic view of attitudes among long-term unemployed') argues strongly
against such an approach in the UK, asking: 'If there are no jobs out there,
what is the point in raising people's hopes?'
Of course, our aim should be sufficient jobs for all those who seek
employment. But what should our response be if, as now seems likely,
registered unemployment in the UK remains above 3m well into the mid-1990s?
This is surely the question which urgently needs to be addressed - and it is
one which Full Employment UK explores through consultations with randomly
selected groups of long-term unemployed people across the UK.
While there are a number who support Mr O'Driscoll's view, we have found
that a majority favour the idea of a new contract between themselves and
society, under which society would guarantee them work in return for them
giving up their right to 'a giro for doing nothing'.
Long-term unemployed people generally recognise that 'something for nothing
welfarism' makes it easiest for those of us lucky enough to be in work to
forget our responsibilities towards them - just as it makes it easier for
many of them to give up on themselves.
Of course, many fear that they could be exploited in a 'workfare' system
unless, from the very outset, the government made a proper commitment to
developing a high-quality programme. For most, however, the bottom line
seems to be that obligatory work is better than obligatory isolation,
trapped behind the front door with little prospect of finding regular
employment. Peter Ashby,

FT  09 FEB 93 / Flagship on the rocks: The EC's HDTV strategy is failing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Community's strategy to develop advanced cinema-quality
television has a new helmsman, its third in eight years. But Mr Martin
Bangemann, EC industry commissioner since 1989, may have taken control of
Europe's high-definition television (HDTV) policy too late.
Eight years after it was launched, the erstwhile flagship of EC industrial
policy is still far from land. Even the shipbuilders themselves now fear
that the current policy is holed below the waterline.
Ten days ago, Philips, the Dutch electronics manufacturer, and one of the
biggest investors in Europe's HDTV project, announced it had suspended plans
to mass-produce television sets compatible with the EC's preferred HDTV
transmission standard, HD-Mac. Senior Commission officials say Mr Bangemann,
who only took responsibility for HDTV last month, may be forced to admit the
failure of the original policy.
Obituaries of EC HDTV policy would not be favourable. A recent report by
National Economic Research Associates (Nera) of London and Brunel University
describes the European strategy, in comparison with Japanese and US
policies, as 'the most unfortunate in its timing and potentially the most
costly to the region's taxpayers and consumers'.
When the plan was launched in 1985, the Commission's aim was to corner a new
and lucrative consumer electronics market with a combination of technical
standards, investment and aggressive marketing.
That approach backfired almost immediately. Advances in technology meant
satellite broadcasters were able to circumvent the 1986 legislation and
transmit programmes using standards which were not part of the EC-backed
'Mac' family of standards.
Three years later, attempting to salvage the strategy, Mr Bangemann's
predecessor, Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, sought to encourage broadcasters,
manufacturers and satellite operators to work together on HDTV projects,
with the incentive of EC funding for HDTV programme-making and transmission.
Mr Pandolfi proposed an Ecu850m (Pounds 688m) five-year action plan which
would support the development of wide-screen television as an intermediate
step towards HDTV.
Britain is blamed by its EC partners for torpedoing this strategy. At
acrimonious meetings of EC telecommunications ministers late last year, the
UK vetoed the plan, arguing the spending was not justified.
In particular, Britain claims that the analogue standards on which the
Community's strategy has been based could quickly be superseded by digital
transmission technology. Digital signals are electrical (analogue) signals
which have been converted into binary codes. Digital systems can process and
distribute a greater volume of information more rapidly than analogue
systems and, unlike analogue, can be used for terrestrial as well as
satellite broadcasting.
The strongest supporters of the action plan - France, the Netherlands and
the Commission itself - were incensed by the British action. They accused
the UK of reneging on commitments made at the Edinburgh summit of EC leaders
in December. But, despite the pressure on the UK, Philips' decision suggests
Europe may have been witnessing the death-throes of the HD-Mac strategy.
Disappointed by the political confusion, Philips argues there is no point in
producing HD-Mac sets if funding is not available for transmission on that
system. Commission telecommunications officials, enthusiasts for the Mac
strategy, tried to put a brave face on the decision last week, pointing out
that Philips would complete its research into the system and would be ready
to produce HD-Mac television sets if funding was cleared.
But Philips and Thomson, its French counterpart, both fierce lobbyists of
the Commission during the standards debate, have already changed their
commercial strategy. Rather than wait for regulatory guidance on standards,
they will concentrate on producing wide-screen television sets to lower
definition standards.
Mr Bangemann also appears to be reconciling himself to the demise of the
HD-Mac plan. Last week, he hinted that, under his management, EC policy
could have humbler ambitions concentrated on promotion of wide-screen
technology. He said the EC should back the development of less bulky
flat-screen sets and should encourage the production and conversion of
programmes for broadcast on wide-screen television. Some of these elements
could be included in a compromise that Denmark, current holder of the EC
presidency, hopes could provide an agreement when EC telecommunications
ministers next meet on May 10.
There is still considerable doubt about whether Britain would back any
funding plan, and French officials say it is likely that there will be
another high-level dispute over the UK's intransigence. But even if a less
ambitious short-term strategy is adopted, the demise of HD-Mac would leave
the Community without a long-term HDTV policy. The US, which is expected to
select an advanced digital television standard later this year, will gain a
headstart of up to five years in the HDTV market. Industry analysts believe
the EC and Japan, which also backed an analogue system, will eventually be
forced to adopt the US standard.
Such a development would not necessarily damage European industry - Philips
and Thomson are also involved in one of the consortia bidding to produce the
US standard - but it would be humiliating for the EC policymakers.
Putting digital technology on the market would also take a long time.
European manufacturers expected HD-Mac sets to be marketed from 1992, but
the Nera/Brunel report forecasts that only 9 per cent of European households
will have digital HDTV sets by 2004.
In the meantime, the main consolation for EC politicians, manufacturers and
broadcasters, would be that they and EC consumers had reaped some useful
by-products from heavy investment in Mac technology. Wide-screen technology
has advanced, and improvements in picture quality have been achieved, both
of which would have taken much longer without Community backing.
But the main victory for European industry - that it built a working HD-Mac
system - appears Pyrrhic. 'It's a perfect system,' says Ms Angelique
Hoogakker, a Philips spokeswoman. 'You'll find plenty of disagreement about
implementation and standards, but no one will deny the quality of the
system. It's only a shame that, now we have got the advantage in the market,
we can't put it into practice.'
One industry spokesman likens the original HDTV policy to Nasa's costly
lunar programme in the 1960s. 'It was a difficult goal, with many
technological spin-offs,' he says. The difference, of course, is that man
did eventually walk on the moon.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Work-out for welfare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They're off. The race to cut the cost of social security, and possibly
healthcare, has begun. The prize is a politician's dream: lower taxation,
and a golden harvest of votes. To win, a party must find convincing ways of
rolling back the frontiers of the welfare state. There's a vision for you.
It will be a marathon run. Labour's commission on social justice will
produce its first discussion papers this summer, but it is not expected to
report until a year after that. The government's review of public spending,
announced yesterday, may take even longer. Both British parties will benefit
from watching the United States, where President Bill Clinton is wrestling
with his campaign promise to get people off the welfare rolls and into work,
while his wife tries to set up a genuinely national health service at no
extra cost.
I will not wear you down with too many statistics. We are all aware of the
explosive growth in the number of claimants on both sides of the Atlantic
since the end of the second world war. But - just as a reminder - in 1948
about 1m people were living on national assistance in Britain. Over the
following 30 years that little army nearly trebled, to 2.9m. The payout had
by then been renamed supplementary benefit, but that did not make it any
cheaper. The latest figure, for 1991-92, is 4.8m. The name has changed
again, to income support, but the number is still growing.
Invalidity benefit, paid to half a million people in 1976-77, was collected
by 1.3m in 1991-92. Retirement pensions were paid to 8.25m elderly persons
in 1976-77; today 10m pension books get cashed at post office counters each
week. It is no wonder that social security accounts for a third of central
government expenditure.
The thinking behind all of it is now challenged by both major parties. One
result will almost certainly be a gradual reduction in the amount spent on
state pensions. Everyone is on to that. Mr David Willetts, the Conservative
backbench MP described by the prime minister last week as the newest
addition to a 'distinguished list of Conservatism's historians and
philosophers', has offered his own contribution to the debate. Mr Willetts
is too young to claim a place alongside Disraeli or Salisbury, let alone
Burke. He has, however, produced a stimulating pamphlet on pensions*.
As he points out, it is wrong to assume that all poor people are old, or
that all old people are poor. Between 1979 and 1988 social security benefits
paid to retired persons rose by 14 per cent. Occupational benefits rose by
99 per cent and savings income, puffed up by high interest rates, by even
more. Yet some three-fifths of pensioners are still heavily dependent on
taxpayers. As a general rule, the older the pensioner, the poorer. Mr
Willetts' conclusion is that substantially higher rates of benefit should be
paid to the over-80s. This implies that, over time, the under-80s should
take increasingly less from the rest of us.
My guess is that if the government does not pick this one up Labour's social
justice commission will, possibly giving it a spin by making the cut-off age
75.
This is not out of line with the precepts of the Beveridge report, the
founding document of the British welfare state, published 50 years ago. 'It
was Beveridge's great insight,' says Mr Willetts, 'that benefits aimed at
broad categories of people . . . would be well targeted on alleviating
poverty while avoiding the administrative nightmares of means testing.' The
same principle, he argues, could be said to support indexation of child
benefit for under-fives, while leaving the amount for older children to
wither on the vine.
None of this is easy. Mothers cannot easily go out to work while infants are
below school age. That justifies a higher benefit. Yet as Mr Willetts will
discover as his own toddlers grow up, children get more, not less, expensive
to run. Can reduction of benefit for older children really be justified?
I do not say this merely to tease the author. Universal hand-outs are
eagerly collected by the middle classes, the non-poor. Reducing the amounts
or taking them away is the toughest kind of politics. Mr Clinton's advisers
know this. That is why Medicaid and US social security are thought of as
practically untouchable. Schemes aimed at the very poor, like America's aid
to families with dependent children, are unpopular with the majority of
voters.
Mr Willetts also proposes to raise the retirement age for both men and women
to 67, with 65 as an interim stage. He rightly regards the dramatic fall in
labour force participation by people in their 50s and 60s as 'a dangerous
absurdity'. As he says: 'The real problem isn't that too many people live
too long, it is that too many people stop working too soon.'
What he does not address is the question of how far total employment can be
increased, given a long-term trend rate of growth of the economy of, say,
2.5 per cent. The Labour party is better placed to take up the hint given by
Mr John Smith in his important weekend speech that a 'new definition of full
employment', to include part-time workers, is needed.
This is not, however, a matter of mere party politics. The intellectual
climate is changing. Labour will steal ideas thrown up by Mr Michael
Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, in his review. The opposition's
proposals will be lifted by the Tories.
Pensions are only one part of a much larger story. Every corner of the
welfare system will be scrutinised during the next few years. Last week the
prime minister threw out a hint about 'workfare'; Labour's commission will
have to examine schemes aimed at ensuring that, where possible, the state
tries to find suitable jobs for unemployed claimants. The point at which the
benefits system is a disincentive to work - the 'poverty trap' - will once
again be the subject of endless recalculation.
You can feel the time for new ideas ripening. The German social democrats'
slogan, 'markets where possible, the state where necessary', was fine when
the matter at issue was the exact mix in a mixed economy. Today's task is to
reduce the number of dependants. Committees considering this might adopt a
new slogan - 'work where possible, welfare where necessary'. It would do for
either party. Pin it on the wall.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Letter: Expensive interest policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From TETSURO KIKUCHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In Japan we have an old proverb, stemming from our close ties with
China: 'Nothing is more expensive than that which seems free.'
This is particularly true when it comes to cutting interest rates. Far from
being a 'free' policy - ie quick, painless and without expense to a
cash-strapped government - it is, in fact, a very expensive one. But its
true costs are hidden.
First, it has a dramatic effect on the value of the pound abroad. Last year,
one pound was worth Y260. Now it trades at only Y180. Seen from Japanese
eyes, everything in Britain from toothpaste to houses has lost one-third of
its value. Britain Inc must be the biggest bargain of 1993.
Second, a freely devaluing currency, unsupported by interest rates, imports
inflation, making foreign goods more expensive to buy.
Third, interest rate cuts act as a form of subsidy to British industry.
Company debt repayments are lowered, easing the pressure on debt-ridden
businesses. But it is dangerous to rely on monetary policy. It is an easy
option for a government that otherwise lacks a comprehensive economic
policy. But it is a political cop-out. It is paid for in the end by ordinary
consumers and future unnecessarily high interest rates.
The devaluing of a nation's currency gnaws at the heart of a country's
self-respect and dignity. The decline of sterling has, like your monarchy,
been a source of great sadness both in Britain and abroad.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Letter: Role of the British Tourist Authority is far from
superfluous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER J BATES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was in Japan on a sales mission when I heard of the resignation of
the chairman of the British Tourist Authority and his chief executive
('Tourist authority chief quits', January 27), and I was on a British
Airways flight home before I read press comment about the government's
support for tourism.
The press comment I have seen questions whether or not the commercial sector
should undertake the role of overseas promotion themselves and hints that
the British Tourist Authority's role may be superfluous.
Nothing could be further from reality. Having just led a sales mission to
Japan, an important growth market for tourism to this country, I fully
appreciate the work of the BTA. Briefing us on arrival, advising how market
conditions have changed since our last visit, on what the consumer and the
travel trade now expect and what new opportunities have arisen, should not
be underestimated.
Most companies cannot afford to have an office in Japan and must rely on
representation and the government tourist office. This is not an area in
which our very able embassy in Tokyo is involved.
Without the BTA, how else could we have identified and entertained more than
90 journalists in Osaka and Tokyo, all of whom in the future may write about
Britain.
We need a strong, articulate body co-ordinating British tourism interests
overseas, guiding commercial interests, co-ordinating joint ventures between
airlines, hoteliers and other interested parties, such as charge-card
companies.
The government should not fall into the trap of believing that the industry,
which is fragmented and often consists of small businesses, can do it alone.
Britain is being seriously challenged by other European countries that are
prepared to invest. France, Italy and Spain are all attempting to increase
their market share.
We need government support and it is time the heritage department recognised
the value of the work carried out overseas to support and to underpin the
work of the commercial sector.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Letter: Leyland-Daf symptomatic of a wider economic threat
to UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JIM HAMILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Most of the debate concerning Leyland-Daf has foc-used on the specific
problems of the European truck industry. The expected job losses, however,
are part of a wider trend that will have serious implications for the
long-term future of British industry.
The UK has been the most important target country for cross-border mergers
and acquisitions in Europe. Between 1985 and 1991, foreign companies made a
total of 1,189 UK acquisitions valued in excess of Pounds 54bn. This
accounts for almost half of the total value of all cross-border deals in
Europe in the same period.
Many of the UK's largest companies have passed into foreign ownership
through being acquired. As well as Leyland-Daf, these include Beecham
(SmithKline), Rowntree (Nestle), STC (Northern Telecom), Jaguar (Ford),
Pearl Group (Australian Mutual), Midland Bank (Hongkong and Shanghai). Of
equal importance has been the large number of small and medium-sized UK
companies (SMEs) becoming foreign-owned. More than 40 per cent of the total
number of deals have involved acquisitions of Pounds 1m or less.
The wave of foreign takeovers raises important issues concerning the impact
on the UK economy. 'Greenfield' foreign direct investment in the UK has
generally been welcomed as making a positive contribution to the economy (eg
technology transfer, increased exports, employment creation, improved
international competitiveness, etc). The economic impact of foreign
acquisitions in the UK is less clear.
Negative effects may be employment losses following post-acquisition
rationalisation; reduced local linkages; reduced exports as a consequence of
changing plant status; and the transfer of certain head office functions
(for example, R&amp;D and marketing) out of the UK to the new parent company.
Leyland-Daf may be the first of many similar cases to emerge over the next
few years. The full effects of any merger or acquisition will normally take
between three and five years to work through.
Thus, given the boom in foreign takeovers in the UK during the late 1980s
and 1990s, it will only be over the next few years that the full effects of
these will become clear. Big UK losses can be expected across a range of
sectors as a consequence of post-acquisition rationalisation and
consolidation.
A new era of foreign multinational-British labour conflict may be
approaching, reminiscent of the plant closure battles of the 1970s.
