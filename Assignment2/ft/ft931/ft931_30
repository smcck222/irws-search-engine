FT  09 FEB 93 / Arts: Bluebeard's Castle and Erwartung - Opera in Toronto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bartok's one-acter and Schoenberg's 'monodrama' are both couple dramas, even
if in Erwartung one member of the couple is missing presumed dead. Both,
too, gradually reveal a past in which other people - specifically, other
women - were involved. Both look back to that past across a chasm of
incomprehension: they are crisis pieces, both dating from the time of
musical crisis around 1910. And both are operas in which the essential
action is interior. They fit together well, if, as in the Canadian Opera
Company's new production at the O'Keefe Centre, Toronto, the longer Bartok
piece comes before the exploded, shattered Schoenberg. They also, as a pair,
provide an apt and stimulating occasion for the operatic directing debut of
Robert Lepage.
The Bluebeard's Castle is not so unusual. The spoken introduction is wisely
cut; instead there is a great gilt frame around the stage picture to tell us
that what we are seeing is a parable, and to enforce a visual connection
with the companion piece. The first images within the frame are striking: a
miniature gothic castle rotating in darkness and distance, and then - once
Bluebeard and Judith have gone into the picture after delivering their first
lines from in front of the frame - an oppressively gloomy, severely
square-sectioned tunnel or corridor, coming towards us from a faintly lit
portcullis entrance, with the seven doors along the left wall and unbroken
masonry along the right (designed by Michael Levine). So far, so good.
But the stage inventions for the openings of the doors are disappointingly
tepid: a patch of flame-like light for the torture chamber; for the jewel
house, a handful of pearls which, in a limp gesture, Judith scatters; a
projection of planet earth for Bluebeard's domain; a lake of tears that
Judith can coyly dabble her hand in. Only for the final opening does the
production heat up, as Bluebeard's three former wives seem to rise up
through the tear lake, though what drenches their wedding gowns is blood.
Here too the orchestra, under Richard Bradshaw, begins to sound excited,
especially in the climactic passage where Judith takes her place with her
predecessors. Before this the sound is dim and disconnected, and devalued in
the domains sequence by a weedy organ. Yet the vocal performances are
excellent: Jane Gilbert is a noble Judith, determined and always richly
voiced, and Victor Braun sustains a grey lyricism as a Bluebeard scarred and
numbed by experience, never believing he can escape his fate.
If this Bluebeard could almost have been staged by anyone, the Erwartung
comes at us observed by a very special eye. Mr Lepage takes advantage of
having three supernumeraries for Bluebeard's earlier wives to increase the
dramatis personae of Schoenberg's solo opera. When the performance starts,
in silence, the unnamed Woman of the score is cowering by the bare wall left
over from Bluebeard, while a man in a white coat sits ready to take notes.
One's heart sinks at the prospect of an 'explanation' of Erwartung as a
psychoanalytic session: that was where the piece began, in the experiences
of the librettist Marie Pappenheim as a medical student in
turn-of-the-century Vienna, not where it ended, or should end.
However, the realism is only there to be turned into the chilled, poised
surrealism of Lepage's production, which demands, and gets, feats of
gymnastic control from his extras. The next time we see the psychiatrist -
the set repeatedly darkens to focus on the Woman allowing nimble
scene-shifting - he is calmly sitting sideways on, as if the wall were a
floor, while another man, later identified as the Woman's lover, dangles
alarmingly through a hole in the wall from one heel.
The mesmerising glide from image to image takes account of what specific
elements there are in the libretto, such as the Woman's reinterpretation of
her lover's corpse as a log in the forest through which she imagines herself
searching. There are also echoes of the Bluebeard staging: Judith rolls
rapidly down the stage away from her husband; the lover's naked body makes
the same journey slowly, anxiously followed by the Woman who has just lashed
at him with a scythe. But more generally the response is to the strangeness
and fluidity of the music, to its intensity, its sharp, glistening focus.
Even though Schoenberg's own designs for the piece suggest something dark
and indistinct, this clinically accurate askewness, this language of dreams,
is right on target.
Contact between the stage and the score is further assured by Rebecca
Blankenship's imposing performance as the Woman, and by the orchestral
playing, which is so much more alert than in the Bartok, and which, in its
delicacy touches the lunar beauty of Schoenberg's music.
The double bill goes to the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York this week,
and to Edinburgh in the summer

FT  09 FEB 93 / Arts: The Tate puts on new clothes - William Packer
questions the gallery's current rehang policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Early every year since 1990, the Tate has paraded itself, proud and elegant,
in its new finery: which is not to suggest for one moment, pace the poor
Emperor in the old story, that the exercise is become a charade and
self-deceptive sham. The clothes are there all right, intriguing and
fetching by turns. And if they should seem at times a trifle skimpy, and
just a little more see-through than before, is that not but the very latest
thing of modern fashion?
The debate, of course, remains as hot and furious as ever, for one man's
chic is another's frumpiness, or misjudgment, or active indecency. For my
part I find a great deal to be said in favour of this year's rehang, as
before. Nicholas Serota's great achievement as incoming director, as he was
in 1990 when this rolling programme of rehanging began, was to reclaim and
celebrate the Tate Gallery itself, as architecture at the service of art.
We had simply forgotten how good a building the Tate really is at its
fin-de-siecle heart, ample, generous and confident in its purposes. That
first thrill of surprised recognition remains, undiminished. No matter that
this time the sculpture halls contain Rodin at one end and the conceptual
minimalism of Carl Andre and his friends, bricks and all, at the other. To
move through from the bustle of the entrance lobby and out into that high,
long, central nave is to experience and savour one of London's most
particular architectural experiences.
And while the feeling may not be sustained at quite such a pitch of
magnificence, sustained it is in kind through the sequence of the older
rooms, each one hung with exquisite consideration, quite as much for the
room itself as for the work to be presented. Only with the drab functional
walls of the 1970s extension does there come any sense of anti-climax, and
even here it is hardly for want of effort on the part of the directorate.
Every room is well presented within the terms it sets itself. Most rooms
contain particular works, often unshown these many years, of remarkable
interest and quality. Exception may be taken to the what of it, but surely
not in any fairness to the way of its being shown.
It is the irony of the situation that Mr Serota has now contrived for
himself, that it is indeed quite as much the way as the what of it, for
which, fairly or not, he stands generally rebuked. The nub is neatly put on
his behalf, and with unconscious irony, by the sponsor, BP, in its
introductory statement to the Brief Guide to these New Displays. 'From the
outset, the purpose of our partnership with the Tate Gallery has been to
enable many more people to see works of art which would otherwise remain in
storage . . . the full range of both the national collection of British art
from 1500 to the present day and of international 20th century art (has thus
been) more fully exposed than ever before.'
Up to a point, Lord Copper. The real issue is what the Tate is, or should
be, or could be, and it has clearly been Mr Serota's intention from the
outset to make no bones about the problems he faces. For the Tate as it is
presently constituted is riven by stresses and contradictions of purpose and
policy that are all but irreconcilable, and all to be addressed on evidently
inadequate resources. That first rehang, in 1990, was quite as much a
political as a curatorial statement, as though to say: here is a gallery
into which we can only put so much, if we are to show things as they should
be shown: and here is a collection with which we could do so much, if only .
. .
It is an argument with which I have a great deal of sympathy. The Tate has
magnificent collections which are inadequately presented not by any
professional dereliction or neglect, but simply because anything better is
impossible. The wonder is that they are presented at all, let alone with the
manifest care, imagination and commitment that are the character of this
present 'inadequacy'. But how can the Tate hold at once the national
collection of British art, that alone would more than fill the present site,
and of the art of the modern period, into which the British contribution
must be integrated, and of contemporary art, in all its forms, that must be
monitored and collected on the wing?
The point was well made, and made, and made, and is now made again - which
is where sympathy begins, if not to fail, at least to moderate. For what was
at the outset a fine and necessary demonstration begins now to seem
indulgent. Whatever its strains and stresses, the Tate remains the
repository of a collection and national resource that for three years now
and at least one to come, has not been available to the public in any
practical and permanent sense. What we have had instead has been an extended
sequence of special exhibitions, beautifully chosen and arranged on all
manner of themes, that is a wonderful bonus for the frequent and specialist
visitor, but quite arbitrary for any newcomer.
The historic British collection up to 1900 is now confined to the first nine
rooms of 30. From room 10, the paintings spread ever fewer on the wall, to
confound the argument that space is at a premium. Everywhere there are
memorable and lovely things, a magnificent double portrait by Fantin-Latour
in room 10, Cedric Morris's eggs in room 20.
There were different delights last year and the year before, which I dearly
wish were there still, and I shall regret it when this year's works, too,
soon disappear.
Last year I entered a plea, not for the reversal of the rehang policy, but
rather for its moderation and gradual consolidation around a re-established
core. No change there: and in again taking the general principle, I have had
no space to treat the particular displays, splendid, controversial,
infuriating as by turn they are. I hope to return at least to some of them
in due course.

A strong night on BBC 2, which is just as well looking at the competition -
unless you are a fan of Spender (BBC 1, 9.30), which in its last episode
sees the Geordie cop getting to grips with a crooked property developer and
his troublesome ex-wife.
The Gun and The Veil (BBC 2, 7.45) investigates the profound influence of
the spirit of Islamic renewal on Egyptian society. The blind theologian,
Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, leader of the outlawed Islamic League, is
interviewed in exile in New York and declares his conviction that the
government of President Mubarak must be overthrown. He and his followers
also justify the recent bloody attacks on tourists. Women speak about their
reactions to pressure to adopt pious dress and behaviour.
Viewers new to The Ark (BBC 2, 9.25), the documentary series about London
Zoo, may not find it easy to appreciate tonight's denouement, the Special
General Meeting which seals (no pun intended) the fate of London Zoo's
management and director. But watch it, all the same. Clever, subtle, and
absorbing, The Ark has been a joy.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Arts: Contemporary contrasts in style - Weekend concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC Symphony Orchestra's current series of Royal Festival Hall concerts
 -low-priced, informally presented, imaginatively planned, and (as ever)
simultaneously broadcast on Radio 3 - seems to be catching on. Friday's
programme, conducted by Mark Wigglesworth, placed music by Messiaen and the
53-year-old Dutch composer Louis Andriessen side by side. It was well
attended and well received - as indeed it deserved to be: the mixture was
uncommonly lively, stimulating, even perhaps a touch troubling.
The revised version of Andriessen's De Snelheid ('Velocity') was given its
premiere. This is a 'process' piece - the composer's own phrase from his
introductory chat with Steve Martland - and an attempt to create complex
effects of fast movement through contrasts and conflicts of pulse and metre.
From the start a regular beat knocked out on woodblocks provides the musical
foundation. Three differently disposed instrumental groups then proceed to
build upon it in cross-cutting patterns, and the base-beat itself eventually
increases in speed, so that a sense of larger momentum is produced out of
proportion to the sum total of all the jiggling, bouncing - and loudly
delivered - component parts.
The experience will probably have given greatest pleasure to those who like
brash, rock-related sounds bashed out without falter or finesse, and those
who enjoy following the tidy working-out of a self-set conceptual problem.
Andriessen admirers know what to expect, and if a non-admirer complains that
other musical qualities seem non-existent in De Snelheid, he or she is
probably missing the point.
It made for a curious and fascinating contrast to follow this 20-minute
stretch of 1990s high-tech musical brutalism with the 80 minutes, opulent
colour resources, swooning melodic delights and picturesque mysticism of
Messiaen's Turangalla symphony. Wigglesworth, who had led a sharp-cut
account of the Andriessen, here revealed one or two chinks in his
conductor's armour: for while the slow movements were unfolded with suitably
rapt control of pace, the fast ones were persistently smudged and spotted by
out-of-synch orchestral ensemble.
Another set of contrasts was in store in the same hall two evenings later:
Pierre Boulez, conducting the Parisian Ensemble InterContemporain in
Messiaen's 1988 chamber-piece Un Vitrail et des oiseaux and then the
Philharmonia in the 1937 orchestral version of the song-cycle Poemes pour
Mi, brought to the music exactly the combination of spot-on rhythmic
precision and pinpoint applications of colour lacking from Wigglesworth.
Comparison is no doubt improper (for the one conductor is, after all, a
senior musical figure of enormous experience and the other a hugely
promising junior) but inevitable. The exhilaration of Poemes pour Mi was
dangerously increased by the singing - scoreless, totally absorbed in word
and musical phrase, totally transported - of that perpetually astonishing
artist Maria Ewing. Hers is not the weight of voice Messiaen had in mind
when writing it; a vast Isolde-like outpouring is needed to sweep across the
batteries of brass. But by the sheer imaginative force, variousness and
intensity of her delivery she contrived to re-invent both the music and her
singing of it.
This was altogether a rich concert: 'difficult modern music' of the kind now
supposedly passe and unpopular yet offered with cracking zest to a Festival
Hall full of youthful enthusiasts. Boulez also conducted the Ensemble in the
first performance of his revised Derive 2, a coruscating scherzo-movement
buzzing with the animation and flow of fast-moving conversation; and devoted
the centre-part of the programme to Elliott Carter. Final fascinating
contrast: between the knotty excitements and fiercely argued intellectual
exuberance of Carter's Oboe Concerto and Three Occasions and the heady
ecstasies of Messiaen - two composers born (in 1908) only 24 hours apart.
This Ensemble InterContemporain-Philharmonia concert is being broadcast
tonight on Radio 3.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Arts: Death of a Faun - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
His jump could hang in the air and/or cover the stage. Able to seem both
androgynous and animal, he was a vital symbol of the newness of the 20th
century. A shy iconoclast, his liaison with Diaghilev was openly homosexual.
His ballets, L'Apres-midi d'un faune, Jeux, and Le sacre du printemps were
all ground-breaking works of early modernism, and presented aspects of sex
that were new to the stage. Lady Ottoline Morrell told him (possibly her
brightest remark) that when he danced he was not a man - he was an idea.
Maybe no one who saw Nijinsky dance is left alive today, but the legend is
as large as ever. All the above happened before he was 25, and before the
First World War. So did his surprise marriage, which earned him instant
dismissal from the ballet company that had brought him world fame, and
permanent exile from Diaghilev's inner circle. The last part of his legend -
madness - followed. In 1919, he was diagnosed as a schizophrenic, in which
condition he remained until his death in 1950.
Even the mad Nijinsky remains an idea. On the one hand, he identified with
God; on the other, he was often both obscene and violent. Both sides connect
to his creative career. Had his psychological abnormality been responsible
for his creative originality? Or had he been Trilby to Diaghilev's Svengali?
Death of a Faun, by David Pownall, is set in 1929, after Nijinsky has
received news of Diaghilev's death. A one-man show for the ex-dancer
Nicholas Johnson, it is conceived as a 90-minute mad scene. No violence or
obscenities here - but bags of martyrdom.
The real Nijinsky did on one occasion identify with the crucified Christ,
but the God who he wants to be in his diaries is the Creator. And, when he
spoke of dancing, he suggested that it was an exalting experience. But
Johnson-Nijinsky, harping on the pain of dancing, identifies only with
Christ on the cross. And, of course, he makes the connection to Petrushka
(who is first seen hanging in a crucified position). The ex-dancer whom
Johnson and Pownall put on stage is less like Nijinsky than like the more
recent Gelsey Kirkland. Kirkland, another great dancer whose career ended
early, then took to a much more vengeful and self-lacerating career -
celebrity autobiography.
But why bother to point out how wilfully this play misunderstands Nijinsky?
It even mistakes the 'faun' of Nijinsky's ballet (a half-goat rural deity)
for a 'fawn' (a young deer); and Johnson performs the steps with the kind of
intense facial expression that Nijinsky took pains to delete from his
choreography.
The real Nijinsky was both more original and more pathetic than this trite
diddums, and his legend will survive Death of a Faun. Nicholas Johnson,
however, may be doing irreversible damage to his own career. Strain and pain
are not what he himself communicated as a dancer. I remember his lyricism
and sweet pleasure in dancing for an audience; and I am sad to find him
defacing that image. It is better to recall the Mercutio he created in
Rudolf Nureyev's 1977 Romeo and Juliet; and he dedicates these performances
to Nureyev's memory.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: The high cost of damaged goods -
General Motors was last week ordered by a US jury to pay punitive damages of
Dollars 101m. Robert Rice on a civil liability problem slowly getting out of
hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two years ago when former US Vice-President Dan Quayle described America's
legal system as 'a self-inflicted competitive disadvantage' costing Dollars
300bn a year, US lawyers accused him of making cheap political capital at
their expense.
Mr Quayle's remarks struck a cord with the American people and business; in
recent years they have grown used to ludicrous law suits and unjustifiable
multi-million dollar damages awards. A Connecticut man who sued a ladder
maker for Dollars 3m after he fell off and injured himself because the
manufacturer failed to provide a general warning of the dangers of using
ladders is a case in point.
Americans are undoubtedly litigious by European standards - 18.4m lawsuits
were filed last year. But it is the size of awards, particularly awards of
punitive damages for corporate misconduct, which is now causing concern in
the US.
Businesses claim the US civil liability system has itself become a liability
to the economy. Excessive awards discourage innovation and curb
competitiveness. Consumer groups say that the threat of lawsuits and awards
of damages forces companies to make safer products.
The clearest indication that the problem may now be getting out of hand came
last week when General Motors was ordered by an Atlanta jury to pay punitive
damages of Dollars 101m on top of compensatory damages of Dollars 4.2m to
the parents of a 17 year-old boy who died in 1989 when his GMC pick-up truck
crashed and burst into flames.
Damages are high in America largely because they are still set by juries.
Elsewhere, judges determine damages. US juries seem to side with the little
guy suing the corporation, and, in setting awards, appear to be more
influenced by what they feel the corporation can afford to pay than what
would be fair compensation for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff.
Large punitive damages are a recent phenomenon in the US. In 1930 awards of
Dollars 50,000, Dollars 33,333 and Dollars 12,650 were described by a law
magazine as 'startlingly large'. By 1955, the largest punitive damages award
in California was still only Dollars 75,000. In 1991 and 1992 alone,
however, US courts upheld at least 15 punitive damages awards in the range
of Dollars 5m-Dollars 60m.
Recent attempts by businesses to curb levels of punitive damages through the
courts have come to nothing. The US Supreme Court has considered four
constitutional challenges to punitive damages in the past five years but has
yet to uphold a single one.
Now, however, it has accepted for review a case from the West Virginia
Supreme Court involving a punitive damages award of Dollars 10m which may
prompt the Supreme Court 'to decide, at long last, that punitive damages in
the US have gone too far' say Mr Leo Herzel and Mr Roy Englert, partners of
Chicago-based international law firm Mayer Brown &amp; Platt.
If they are right and the Supreme Court succeeds in setting constitutional
limits for punitive damages, lawyers say it will be one of the Court's most
important decisions affecting business for a decade.
The West Virginia case involved a dispute between two businesses, TXO
Production Corp, a subsidiary of US steel oil and gas giant USX Corp, and
Alliance Resources Corp, over rights to oil and gas beneath a tract of land
in the state. A jury decided that TXO's lawsuit claiming doubt about
Alliance's title to the land was frivolous and awarded Alliance Dollars
19,000 in compensatory damages, equivalent to its costs of defending the
action. The jury, however, tagged on a punitive damages award of Dollars 10m
which was upheld by West Virginia's Supreme Court primarily on the ground
that TXO had been 'really mean'.
Punitive damages awards in the US are often based on the belief that large
companies should be made to pay more than small companies partly because
many courts feel this is the only way to impress on senior management the
need for responsible corporate behaviour, say Mr Herzel and Mr Englert.
In the General Motors case, for example, it appears that the jury's decision
to award such a huge sum was because it felt this was the only way to force
the car maker to recall nearly 5m of the same 'sidesaddle' trucks which
prompted the original court action. Critics say the 'sidesaddle' trucks are
unsafe because the petrol tank, which is fitted outside the frame of the
truck, explodes on side impact. General Motors, which made the 'sidesaddle'
trucks between 1973 and 1987, has always maintained they are safe.
Some US courts take a different view, however. Judge Easterbrook of the 7th
Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, for example, believes that ultimately
it is the stockholders, the most important of whom are institutions
representing ordinary people, who will bear the burden of any punitive
damages award against a company. It is wrong, he says, to view punitive
damages as a means of punishing big companies.
In the TXO case the Supreme Court will have to decide whether West
Virginia's system, by relying heavily on the defendant's wealth in assessing
damages, violates due process under the US constitution.
More important, particularly in the light of the General Motors case, the
Supreme Court will also have to decide whether an award of Dollars 10m for a
wrong valued at Dollars 19,000, has crossed the line of 'constitutional
impropriety'. The last time the Supreme Court looked at the issue, in a case
from Alabama, it said a punitive damages award equal to four times the
compensatory damages awarded was 'close to the line'. The Supreme Court
ruling in the TXO case is expected in June.
In any event, the political climate may be beginning to turn against large
punitive damages awards. In Virginia, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals
recently upheld the state's Dollars 350,000 cap on punitive damages. Other
states have also introduced caps for non-economic loss and some require a
proportion of the punitive damages to be paid to the state government rather
than the plaintiff.
For European companies with business interests in the US, the American
damages system is both puzzling and worrying. In Europe, there is strong
resistance within the courts to the type of punitive damages awards seen in
America in recent years.
Last June, the German Federal Supreme Court underlined this by ruling that
American punitive damage judgments are not enforceable in Germany because
they are contrary to public policy.
In England, the Court of Appeal made it clear in the recent Camelford water
pollution case that punitive damages will only be awarded in English law in
very restricted circumstances. Mr David Higgins, a partner in City
solicitors Herbert Smith who acted for the defendants in the Camelford case,
says: 'The judgment makes it clear that the American example will not be
followed here.'
Until the punitive damages issue has been resolved in the US, Mr Herzel and
Mr Englert's advice to large companies doing business in America is simple:
guard against the risk of excessive damages by opting for settlement of
disputes by arbitration or alternative dispute resolution wherever possible.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Restrictive TV policy approved -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court last week provided reassurance for member countries
worried about judicial intervention in the European Community's internal
broadcasting market.
The Court said national legislation limiting licensed broadcasting stations'
rights to invest in, or be involved in, the establishment, or operation of,
foreign stations were permitted under the Rome Treaty's ban on restrictions
on the free movement of capital and freedom to provide cross-border
services.
The Court's ruling was given in response to a reference from the Dutch
Council of State, arising out of proceedings brought by the Dutch media
authority against Veronica, a licensed Dutch television station which
operated on a non-profit-making basis.
The Dutch court found that Veronica had infringed certain provisions of the
1987 Dutch media law. However, it asked the ECJ to interpret the Rome
Treaty's rules relating to capital movements and services so that the
national court could decide on the compatibility of the media law with those
provisions.
Under the Dutch media law, air time is allocated by the Dutch media
authority to broadcasting stations which must be associations of listeners
and viewers established for the purpose of representing a particular social,
cultural, religious or spiritual interest referred to in their
constitutions.
Their exclusive, or at least primary, purpose must be broadcasting and the
satisfaction thereby of the Dutch public's social, cultural, religious or
spiritual needs.
Income must be used by the stations in connection with programme
broadcasting. A large part of their finances comes from subsidies allocated
by the media authority. Other income comes from listeners' and viewers' fees
and advertising revenue.
The provisions of the media law challenged by Veronica prohibited the
broadcasting stations established in Holland from carrying on any activities
other than those authorised by the media law or approved by the media
authority.
The authority accused Veronica of infringing the regulations by
participating in the establishment in Luxembourg of a commercial
broadcasting station planned to transmit into Holland and by providing
effective support.
The media authority relied on three grounds: Veronica's management had
prepared a business plan and provided legal advice; Veronica had provided a
bank guarantee in respect of the current account of RTL-Veronica; and it had
agreed with another company to provide it with finance for the establishment
of a new company which would take a minority stake in RTL-Veronica.
The ECJ held that, in the circumstances of the case, the treaty rules
concerning capital transfers and services did not preclude national media
regulation which prohibits a broadcasting station established in its
territory from carrying on the sort of activities Veronica was accused of.
The Court appears to have reached its conclusions for two different reasons.
First, referring to recent case law concerning Dutch broadcasting
regulation, the ECJ said that Community law recognised as legitimate,
objectives such as those pursued by the pluralist and non-commercial media
and cultural policy implemented in the Dutch media law. Such cultural policy
objectives were in the general good and could be legitimately pursued.
Then the Court changed direction. It referred to earlier case law
establishing that national rules may be enforced to prevent abusive reliance
on treaty rights relating to services for the purpose of circumventing the
national laws that apply to those established in that member state. For that
reason, the court held that the Dutch media law could be enforced to prevent
broadcasting stations from circumventing the national rules.
While the ECJ seems to have extended the legal principles applicable to the
free movement of goods and services to capital transfers, it is not clear to
what extent the court is saying that the questions raised in this case are
purely internal to the member state concerned and, therefore, that Community
law rights are not relevant.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Dollars 5bn award against serial
killer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of increasing disquiet in the US about the rise in the scale of
punitive awards in recent years, the general level of damages rose
significantly last year compared with 1991, according to the US National Law
Journal, writes Robert Rice.
There were eight awards of more than Dollars 100m. One was for Dollars 5bn
against serial killer Robert Berdella, part of which the insurers of his
home may have to pick up; another was for Dollars 3.5bn, later reduced to
Dollars 1.75bn, against Charles Keating in the litigation arising out of the
collapse of the Lincoln Savings and Loan. In 1991 there were two verdicts of
more than Dollars 100m. One was later set aside, the other reduced on
appeal.
The NLJ notes, however, that there were also far more settlements in 1992,
both before and after trial. Many of the largest verdicts were settled
within weeks of being handed down by juries.
But awards in business disputes rose significantly and jury decisions
continued to batter insurance companies.
Accountancy firms were hit by two big verdicts: one for Dollars 338m against
Price Waterhouse which was later set aside, and one of Dollars 558m
involving Coopers &amp; Lybrand in the litigation arising out of the collapse of
the computer disk-drive manufacturer Miniscribe. This was subsequently
settled for an undisclosed sum.
Some of the largest awards from previous years were also overturned or
reduced in 1992. The largest verdict of 1990, Dollars 185m against Dresser
Industries and Baker Hughes over the production of faulty oil-well
fracturing materials, was overturned, while the biggest award of 1991,
Dollars 127.7m against pharmaceutical giant Upjohn in a product liability
case, was reduced to Dollars 38m.
Overall, 17 large awards were settled after the verdict; 11 large verdicts
were overturned or substantially reduced; and 11 prominent case were settled
before trial for amounts of between Dollars 25m and Dollars 500m.

FT  09 FEB 93 / People: Avery, from Lloyds to Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Julian Avery, a solicitor with 20 years' experience in banking, has switched
from one Lloyds to another in his latest career move, becoming the latest of
a growing number of prominent business figures to throw in their lot with
the Lloyd's of London insurance market.
Avery, now 47, has been appointed executive chairman of Wellington Members'
Agency, where he will lead efforts to upgrade the services the agency offers
to the 600 Names whose affairs it handles.
Head of European mergers and acquisitions at Lloyds merchant bank from 1990
until last year, Avery has also had a close involvement with private
banking, especially in Paris where he headed Lloyds' subsidiary between 1986
and 1990.
That should be an ideal blend of experience for a job in which he will need
to persuade the wealthy that the time is right to join Lloyd's, as well as
helping out with efforts to attract corporate capital to the Lloyd's market.
Avery, like Wellington chairman Anthony Haynes who recruited him, is
optimistic about prospects and has himself recently become a Name at
Lloyd's. 'It is entirely appropriate for anyone who expresses confidence in
the market to become a Name,' says Avery.
But even if things don't go too well Avery has other experience that could
come in handy. In the early 1980s he held senior management positions at
Lloyds in Rio de Janeiro where he was closely involved in the Brazilian debt
crisis.

Julian Mounter, former director general and chief executive of Television
New Zealand, is to become president and chief executive of the Hong
Kong-based Star TV. Star beams five channels, including the BBC's World
Service Television, to 38 countries; two years after its launch, it is
available in 11.5m homes.
Cornish-born Mounter, 47, was a journalist on The Times for seven years and
has worked for London Weekend Television and the BBC.
At Television New Zealand, the old New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation,
Mounter pursued 'a policy of modernisation designed to succeed in a
deregulated market' and was involved in everything from telecommunications
to pay tv and video distribution.
But last year he decided 'after 30 years of work' to take a year off and
sail with his family. 'We crossed the Atlantic twice and spent time in the
Caribbean,' he says.
Mounter says he intends to pursue a policy of 'prudent expansion' at Star,
which is owned by Hutchvision, a 50-50 joint venture between Hutchison
Whampoa and a company controlled by Li Ka-shing and his family.
As well as being president of Star TV, Mounter will also be chief executive
of Media Assets, an independent company set up to explore programming
opportunities in Asian markets.
*****
The exit at the weekend of John O'Neill as executive chairman of
Silvermines, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, follows the
completion of the disposal of all the group's engineering activities, as
part of a restructuring which leaves the group with three electrical
companies in the UK and three investment properties in Ireland.
O'Neill resigned 'at his request' after almost five years in the post, and
is being replaced with a non-executive chairman Bob Morton, who joined the
board just three months ago. Morton is a chartered accountant and is
chairman of the Vistec group which supplies computer systems, software and
services. He has also been chairman of the Burgess Group, Norank Systems and
Hatfield Estates. He has a 6 per cent holding in Silvermines.
Other board changes include the appointment of Pat Dineen as vice-chairman,
and the co-option of George Russell as a non-executive director.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Technology: Fundraising for a breakthrough - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS a tale of two companies; both attempting to develop breakthrough
technology, both deemed the leaders in their fields. One is American, the
other Scottish. One is attempting to break world records for computer
performance, the other to deliver on the promise of monoclonal antibodies to
cure deadly diseases.
Both have struggled to raise capital to continue their work. Supercomputer
Systems (SSI) of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, is desperate for new backers. Two
weeks ago the company closed its doors and laid off its employees when funds
ran out.
Founded five years ago by Steve Chen, a reclusive but renowned master of
supercomputer design previously at Cray Research, SSI set out to build the
world's most powerful supercomputer.
Chen's venture won the backing of IBM, which is said to have invested more
than Dollars 100m in the venture since 1987.
However, beset by its own financial problems and impatient as SSI overran
its development schedule, IBM pulled the plug at the end of January. Finding
alternative funding has so far proved impossible.
But SSI's employees have not given up. They continue to seek backing and
claim that by November the company will be able to ship its first product.
They say they have fulfilled SSI's founding dream by creating a prototype
supercomputer which combines vector and parallel processing - the classic
and modern approaches to supercomputing. They believe SSI could still become
the supercomputer market leader by offering a unique combination of
technology, fulfilling the requirements of general-purpose users as well as
research scientists.
Half a world away, Scotgen, of Aberdeen, Scotland, a leader in techniques to
'humanise' mouse antibodies so they are accepted by the human body and can
attack viruses, has also found it hard to raise capital. However, Scotgen's
prospects were significantly brightened by a Dollars 7m injection of US
venture capital, as a result of last week's merger with Vasocor, a
California biotechnology company.
The merged company aims to develop diagnostic tests and treatments for heart
disease, infectious diseases and cancer. Research will be conducted in
Scotland, while the journey from trials to regulatory approval will be
handled from California.
These stories provide several lessons. Scotgen's experience confirms the
concerns of many in the UK that a dearth of venture capital is inhibiting
the formation of new businesses. However, as SSI's plight demonstrates, the
belief widespread among would-be British entrepreneurs that US streets are
paved with venture capital gold is sadly mistaken.
Scotgen's deal was masterminded by Englishman Robert Fildes, a pioneer of
the biotechnology industry and former president and chief executive of
Cetus. He has raised more than Dollars 500m in funding for biotech companies
in the past and has been the architect of several corporate alliances. A
proven management record and experience in raising funds is critical to the
prospects of a development-stage venture.
In contrast, Chen's experience in designing world-acclaimed supercomputers
has not equipped him to address the critical funding crisis that his company
now faces.
Scotgen's story might suggest that national pride should not be allowed to
inhibit companies from seeking funding abroad.
Ironically, SSI may not be free to seek a foreign backer, though it has
tried. Foreign investment in US-based high-tech companies, especially those
whose technology might be of military value, has has long been seen by many
in Congress as 'selling the crown jewels'. Early evidence suggests this will
be the approach of the Clinton administration, too.
While the US may provide a more plentiful capital market for high-tech
ventures, the UK might offer a more benign political environment. In other
words, the grass is not that much greener on the other side of the pond.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Technology: When all the chips are down - Sematech's tiny
microchip highlights the resurgence of the US semiconductor industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is an achievement that some experts have likened to putting a man on the
moon. Using only US-built production tools, Sematech, the government-backed
consortium set up to re-establish US pre-eminence in semiconductors, has
produced microchips containing electronic elements just 0.35 microns wide -
about half the size of the most advanced chips currently in production.
Sematech's breakthrough may be more symbolic than practical. It is expected
to be several years before 0.35 micron technology is used in full-scale
manufacturing. None the less, the achievement highlights the remarkable
resurgence of the US semiconductor industry after several years of having to
bow to Japanese competition.
US companies last year won a larger share of the world chip market than
Japan for the first time since 1985. Intel has become the largest chip maker
in the world, and Applied Materials, a neighbour in Silicon Valley, has
overtaken Tokyo Electron of Japan to become the world's biggest supplier of
semiconductor production equipment.
By making prototype 0.35 micron chips, Sematech set out to demonstrate that
US chip production technology was now at least on a par with the best in
Japan. 'In the semiconductor world, this is equivalent to a moon landing,'
says Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research, a California market research
and consulting group.
This is a far cry from the scepticism shown when Sematech was formed five
years ago. Then, the US semiconductor industry was on its knees, outsmarted
and outsold by Japanese competitors. The US share of the world chip market
was falling rapidly. Japanese chips were widely held to be of higher quality
than those made in the US, and Japanese companies dominated the world market
for semiconductor production equipment and materials.
Yet questions remain about how much credit Sematech should be given for the
revival of the US chip industry and its equipment suppliers. Other factors
include: the US-Japan semiconductor industry trade pact, which forced Japan
to buy more foreign-made chips; the Japanese economic decline; the rise of
Korean chip makers, who compete mainly with Japanese manufacturers of memory
chips; and the strength of the world personal computer market, which has
boosted sales of microprocessor chips, made primarily by US companies.
Has the US semiconductor industry's comeback, therefore, really been a
triumph of government intervention, or is it a demonstration of
private-sector ingenuity and the forces of a free market? The question is
pertinent as the new administration prepares to implement what is expected
to be a more interventionist approach.
'Sematech is the enabler of the US semiconductor manufacturing resurgence,'
says Jim Norling, president and general manager of Motorola's semiconductor
business. 'It would not be an understatement to say that Sematech saved the
(semiconductor production equipment) industry,' adds Papken Der Torossian,
chairman of the Silicon Valley Group, an equipment manufacturer that has
been one of the largest beneficiaries of Sematech research and development
funding.
Others take a more measured view, saying that Sematech served as a catalyst
to get the industry to work together on common problems. Jim Bagley,
president of Applied Materials, says: 'The next generation of wafer
fabrication plants is expected to cost Dollars 800m (Pounds 530m) to Dollars
1bn per factory. The chip makers are saying that they cannot afford it and
that equipment costs must come down, but the US equipment industry is barely
breaking even. It is a Dollars 5.5bn industry that has zero profitability.'
The solution, he and others believe, is greater co-operation between chip
makers and equipment suppliers - as in Japan and elsewhere. Until
regulations were loosened to allow Sematech members to work together on
pre-competitive research, it did not happen in the US.
Critics suggest that Sematech's Dollars 200m annual budget - half from
member companies and half from the Pentagon - went to pay for some
expensive, if important, meetings. The consortium has also, however, funded
research and development that has significantly strengthened some US
semiconductor production equipment companies. This has reduced US chip
makers' dependency on foreign equipment producers, a critical goal of the
Defence Department.
Also, VLSI Research says US equipment suppliers have stemmed the erosion of
their home market by foreign competitors and are beginning to gain ground in
Japan and Europe.
Not everyone in the US semiconductor industry is happy with Sematech's
achievements, however. Some object to government funding of industry
research. Others, including two of Sematech's original 14 member companies,
feel the consortium has focused on the wrong issues. LSI Logic, a Silicon
Valley semiconductor manufacturer, dropped out of the consortium last year
saying it had lost sight of its original goal of improving chip
manufacturing methods.
The Defence Advanced Research Project Agency, which has provided half of
Sematech's funds, last year said it intended to cut annual funding from
Dollars 100m to Dollars 80m. The Pentagon agency views the consortium as a
'tremendous success, resulting in broad infrastructural changes within the
industry', according to a report published by the General Accounting Office
last year.
Darpa explained its proposed reduction in funding by saying the industry
'should bear the primary responsibility for ensuring continued support for
Sematech because it is an industry-led consortium addressing industry
needs'. Its original justification for funding Sematech was to ensure that
the US would lead in the development of advanced weaponry based on
semiconductor chips.
In contrast, industry members of Sematech had a different, although
complementary, objective - to revive their industry. With a Republican
administration opposed to any form of 'industrial policy', the semiconductor
industry executives who founded Sematech saw the Pentagon's concerns about
dependency on foreign technology suppliers as an opportunity to gain
government support.
With the election of President Clinton, US chip makers can afford to be more
frank. They have drawn up a 'road map' of the long-term strategy to maintain
competitiveness. Based on the assumption of no increased government or
private-sector funding for research and development, it is aimed at enabling
industry and government to work together by assigning the most effective
roles to individual semiconductor companies, Sematech, university research
and government-funded national laboratories, in a co-ordinated effort.
WJ Sanders III, chairman and chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices, a
Sematech member company, says: 'I don't favour a lot of government
involvement. I think the only reason Sematech made sense was that our
external trading partners were pummelling us by using their government's
capital.'
While Darpa's money was critical to the formation of Sematech when the US
semiconductor industry was in dire straits, the government agency was
'genteel' in its control over Sematech, observes Bagley, and its financial
contribution relatively small. 'A hundred million dollars a year pales into
insignificance in the context of US government spending . . . half the money
and most of the resources for Sematech have come from industry.'
If Sematech is to be the 'role model for government-industry co-operation',
as Clinton said during his campaign, this points to modest government
support for industry-led efforts rather than large-scale government
programmes to restore industrial competitiveness.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Escaping from the
Euro-VAT maze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANGE in the VAT rules brought about by the creation of the single
European market has led to an anxious time for at least one British company.
Northern Tooling Reclamation, a Wetherby-based company which reconditions
industrial power tools, went through a difficult few weeks when it feared it
might lose a large chunk of its continental European business.
New EC rules which required it to start charging VAT on European deliveries
led to threats from several of its agents that they would no longer be able
to act for the British company.
To make matters worse, confirmation of the rule change did not come through
until early December, just three weeks before they took effect.
Northern Tooling, with sales of just over Pounds 1m - half of them exports -
and a workforce of 60, has found a way of absorbing the impact of the new
tax rules. But only by paying Pounds 20,000 into a special bank account from
which it will make VAT transfers to UK Customs. This avoids charging VAT to
its European customers but means it ties up a large sum of its own money and
takes on an extra administrative burden.
'If we had not had the cash to provide the VAT cash pool and remove the need
for our agents to carry the VAT cost we would have lost their orders,' says
Kenneth Sutcliffe, chairman of the 17-year-old company.
The problem arose when Northern Tooling's activities were classified as
'repair', and subject to VAT, rather than 'process', which is not.
Previously no VAT was payable on EC exports so the distinction did not
matter.
The company told its continental agents that it would add 17.5 per cent VAT
to all its invoices from January 1.
But when Northern Tooling's agents made their own inquiries, some said they
were told by their local VAT authorities that they had no knowledge of the
change.
Sutcliffe checked again with UK Customs, who confirmed the new regulation,
but was told there should be no problem because the agents would be able to
reclaim the VAT. But since the agents had other suppliers who did not
require them to get involved in VAT red tape, they felt they could live
without Northern Tooling.
Setting up the special bank account provides a short-term solution but it
ties up Pounds 20,000 worth of badly needed capital. Northern Tooling will
be able to reclaim the VAT from UK customs but there is a time delay between
the initial payment and the repayment.
It will also result in Northern Tooling paying over VAT to Customs only to
claim it back almost immediately.
Administering the bank account has meant that Northern Tooling has had to
obtain power of attorney from its agents to claim the VAT refund. It has
also had to come to an agreement with UK Customs for it to accept
photocopies of its invoices rather than the originals.
Customs has said it will look at ways to speed up the clearing of Northern
Tooling's VAT refunds so that the impact on the company's cash flow is
minimised. It will also lobby in Brussels for a change in the rules so that
'repair of goods' can be zero-rated.
Like many other UK businessmen faced with single market changes Sutcliffe
feels he is the victim of overzealous interpretation of the rules by UK
Customs. But claims that the VAT authorities in other countries are more lax
are hard to verify and Customs says it has to assume its counterparts on the
continent are applying the rules.
Nevertheless, this episode has been a nasty shock for Sutcliffe and exposed
the vulnerability of his business to decisions taken by bureaucrats in
Brussels and London.
'Had any of our major agents pulled out this would have placed a serious
strain on our business,' he says. 'In normal circumstances we might have
taken this in our stride but we are at the bottom of a recession. Who
benefits?'

FT  09 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Time for taxing the
chancellor - In the run-up to the Budget, Charles Batchelor offers a guide
for small business lobbyists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After decades of neglect small businesses are now rarely out of the
headlines. Are the banks being beastly? Have Whitehall and Brussels tied
them up in red tape? The climate in which small firms operate is subject to
constant scrutiny.
But important though these issues are, of even greater significance is the
tax regime in which business operates. The run-up to the Budget gives small
business lobbyists their best opportunity to influence the man who really
matters, the chancellor of the exchequer.
The small business groups have been joined in recent years by the more
broadly-based business organisations such as the Institute of Directors, the
Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the Confederation of British
Industry. All make reference in their budget submissions to the specific
problems of small firms.
This has been matched by the chancellor's growing willingness to address
their particular concerns. The small business community is a large one with
basic Tory sympathies. Last year saw changes in the VAT rules, a relaxation
of inheritance tax and an easing of the burden of the Uniform Business Rate.
In the view of the lobbyists, however, much remains to be done and this
year's budget submissions contain a wealth of detailed proposals. The main
areas of concern are:
VAT. There is widespread concern that frequent adjustments to VAT are
turning it into a tax on business instead of, as intended, a tax on final
consumption. The IOD warns against it becoming a 'cascade' tax, which
'sticks' and gets built into the costs of businesses further down the chain.
The Federation of Small Businesses calls for the elimination of VAT on
transactions between VAT-registered businesses by zero rating them.
Zero-rating is already applied to cross-border trade within the EC. This
would cut administration costs, minimise the problem of bad debts and reduce
the risk of incurring penalties without affecting the VAT yield to the
Treasury, it says.
Raising the VAT threshold to Pounds 50,000 (from the present level of Pounds
36,600) would remove a heavy compliance burden at little cost, the IOD
suggests.
Capital gains tax. There is widespread agreement among business
organisations that by setting this tax at 40 per cent - the same level as
the top rate of income tax - the government has put an effective brake on
enterprise. Equalising the two taxes took no account of the greater risks
associated with building a business, the CBI says. It suggests that assets
held for seven years should be exempt.
The Association of British Chambers of Commerce limits itself to a call for
a review of the tax threshold and suggests treating short-term gains as
income. The IOD goes much further, arguing for a drastic cut in or abolition
of capital taxes because of their adverse impact on the venture capital
industry.
The British Venture Capital Association makes its own detailed submission,
arguing that the people who build up businesses should enjoy the same tax
breaks as entrepreneurs and managers in other countries. In Britain's main
competitors these people pay no capital taxes or are taxed at far lower
rates.
As an interim measure, the association suggests that working directors or
managers should qualify for rollover relief on the proceeds of the sale of
their shareholdings provided they reinvest the money in an unquoted company
within three years. This would enable successful entrepreneurs to start up a
second or third business becoming, in the association's graphic phrase,
'serial entrepreneurs'.
Alongside rollover relief, the BVCA suggests a further extension of
retirement relief, available to people who sell their businesses after the
age of 55. It calls for the abolition of the age limit and the raising of
eligible gain from Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1m.
Uniform Business Rate. A reduction in the UBR would be the most effective
way of helping businesses survive the recession, according to the IOD and
the Forum of Private Business. Business rates form a large part of the total
costs of many businesses and cuts would have an immediate impact on cash
flow.
A replacement for the Business Expansion Scheme. For all its faults the BES
met a need and its demise at the end of 1993 will leave a gap in the
availability of small amounts of equity. Most venture capital companies are
not able to provide such small sums economically.
The Union of Independent Companies and Federation of Small Businesses have
renewed their plea for a small business development bank which would provide
inexpensive funds along the lines of the Bank for Reconstruction in Germany.
Investment allowances. The chancellor announced a concession in his Autumn
statement which permitted businesses to speed up the rate of depreciation
for one year only, but business groups are seeking more fundamental
alterations.
The IOD believes special areas such as research and development spending
should have more generous treatment. Together with the CBI, it thinks the
accelerating pace of change makes established depreciation criteria look
increasingly irrelevant. Is it still realistic, asks the IOD, to expect an
industrial building to last for 25 years?
It also calls for a change in government policy on what are quaintly known
as 'nothings', a ragbag category of business expenses which the Revenue does
not allow to be set against tax. They include abortive capital expenditure,
lease payments on cars costing more than Pounds 8,000 and, most importantly,
the costs of issuing equity capital. The abolition of the BES is an
additional reason for a concession on the cost of issuing shares, the IOD
says.
Inheritance tax. The small business lobby has done quite well in this area
in recent years but is keen to finish this tax off for good. Both the IOD
and the chambers of commerce are seeking its complete abolition. Even in its
present form this tax encourages business owners to retain their assets
until death when it might be better for them to pass them earlier to the
next generation, the chambers argue.
Failing complete abolition, the rate should be halved to 20 per cent and the
threshold doubled to Pounds 300,000, the IOD says.
Compliance costs. The announcement last week of a comprehensive government
campaign against red tape has been given a cautious welcome by the business
community, which has nevertheless still targeted instances of bureaucracy in
the budget submissions.
A decision to levy National Insurance contributions retroactively on
benefits in kind has forced many companies to check back through six years
of accounts to bring themselves up to date, say the chambers. The different
yardsticks that apply to PAYE and National Insurance contributions also
complicate life for the small business owner.
The heavy costs, in both time and money, incurred by the smaller company in
administering VAT, PAYE and National Insurance, justify lower taxes for this
sector, says the Forum of Private Business.
The recession, coupled with a ballooning public sector borrowing
requirement, means Norman Lamont has little scope for cutting taxes on March
16. The small business sector nevertheless believes it has a strong case for
sympathetic treatment.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory MPs uneasy at Portillo's
review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY BACKBENCHERS yes-terday argued for keeping large areas of the welfare
state out of the government's strategic review of public spending
priorities, as Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury,
outlined his plans in the Commons.
In the Commons, Tory backbench concerns focused principally on the National
Health Service and pensions. However, Tory MPs were privately voicing fears
that the review would not achieve its aim of reassuring the markets.
More than one commented that the government seemed to have no appetite for
taking radical decisions, and that no crackdown on spending that was likely
to be approved by the Commons would have enough impact on public borrowing.
'It's more than window-dressing, and it's essential but it won't get us out
of the deficit problem. The only ways out of that are inflationary growth
and extending the VAT base,' one backbencher said gloomily.
The public warnings to Mr Portillo began with a contribution from Mr James
Couchman, the Tory MP for Gillingham, who said the provision of healthcare
free at the point of delivery was cherished by rich and poor alike.
'Any erosion of that principle would be resented very deeply throughout the
country,' Mr Couchman cautioned.
On pensions, Sir Anthony Grant, Conservative MP for Cambridgeshire South
West, urged Mr Portillo to bear in mind that an increasing number of elderly
people had based the last years of their lives on present figures.
'They are not in a position to make drastic changes at this stage of their
life, and they don't expect to be let down,' Sir Anthony said.
Labour's bitter opposition to the review was signalled by Ms Harriet Harman,
shadow chief secretary. She condemned it as a 'panic response' to the
government's economic mismanagement.
'It would be wholly wrong if the British people, already suffering in this
recession, ended up paying the price in worse policing, worse schools and
worse healthcare, and in lost pensions and lost benefit,' she said.
The prospect of alliances between Labour and some Tories has already been
enough to blunt the cutting edge of last year's spending round, and some
Tories believe the government's 21-seat majority will undermine the
confidence which yesterday's statement that the government would tackle
public spending was intended to create.
'They'll be tougher about spending for four years hence than they will for
next year,' said one former minister.
The only way to achieve spending cuts, according to one MP, was for the
Treasury simply to present a stark choice: 'Ministers will have to give
people the choice between cuts and income tax rises,' he said.

Ivo Dawnay tracks John Smith's first steps on a long election race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY

<DATELINE>
   IF Mr Neil Kinnock was the hare, then Mr John Smith is the tortoise
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
solid and reliable if maddeningly plodding.
Last Sunday in Bournemouth, the Labour leader's speech to the party's local
government conference marked the end of a long winter's contemplative
hibernation and his first steps in the race for Downing Street.
What seemed equally clear at Westminster yesterday was that the great
majority of Labour MPs of both left and right were breathing a collective
sigh of relief. But had Mr Smith's advocacy of an end to dogma been a
clandestine announcement of the end of socialism? So long had the wait been
for news, any news, from the leader's bunker, that no one appeared to care.
All this says much about Mr Smith's leadership technique - a style about as
far from the Kinnock 'bang the table first, ask questions afterwards'
approach as it is possible to be. Yet if Mr Smith's agenda is to continue
down the Kinnock path of reform, it is still wholly impossible to gauge how
far he is ready to go.
One theory - that of some opponents - has it that Mr Smith's highly
conservative Scottish Labourism sees nothing essentially wrong with the
party's positions but a good deal to criticise in the greedy,
self-interested electorate. His aim is to broaden Labour's appeal to their
baser interests while keeping the party's core objectives unchanged.
The second view - largely that of his admirers - is that what has appeared
to many to be indolence or complacency is in fact a grand, long-term and
radical strategy. By keeping his counsel, Mr Smith has waited until the
chorus of 'Something must be done' has neared a crescendo before
authoritatively dictating that something will be.
A painstaking textual analysis of the Bournemouth speech leaves the reader
equally uncertain about the conclusions to be drawn. Mr Smith's call for 'a
new politics that puts people first, that rejects dogma and embraces
practical, common-sense solutions' is a case in point.
It can either be interpreted as a lightly coded epitaph for socialism - a
final burial of ideology in favour of a new individualism lightly sprinkled
with social democratic altruism; or, alternatively, merely banal platform
rhetoric.
Most Labour MPs appear ready to embrace the broad sentiments. They liked the
definition of the Labour task as 'to stand again and again for the
frustrated ambitions of the majority of our people'.
But there was also concern that the sandwich lacked a beefy filing of policy
prescriptions. Today, the government's advocacy of further privatisation for
such as British Rail and the Post Office appears to be, in Mr Smith's words,
'well beyond the limits of public approval and comprehension'.
Yet that is a far from secure guarantee that by 1996-97 Labour will be able
to sail to victory as the party of moderation and sound management and a
popular hedge against Tory extremism. Nor is it by any means certain that Mr
Smith's crusade against vested interests, whether in the privatised
utilities, the City or among other elite groups, has any real resonance
among the electorate.
What seems more certain is that the scramble for the centre-ground of
British politics is under way. Furthermore, in spite of the wailing in the
wilderness stage from figures such as Mr Bryan Gould, most of the left are
still aboard Mr Smith's creaky bandwagon - if sceptically so.
Mr Alan Meale, the leftwing MP for Mansfield, commented: 'With Kinnock you
could bargain; when Smith takes a decision you either play or you don't. The
left must fight its corner from inside.'
Nothing in Mr Smith's speech was wildly new. But by declaring the death of
dogma, he has nonetheless pushed the party closer to the anti-ideological
voters outside its ranks. 'It is,' said one prominent Labour moderniser,
'proof that things are moving in the right direction, but, Lord, why does it
have to take so long.'

MR JOHN Prescott, shadow transport secretary, yesterday called on the
government to introduce radar surveillance of shipping routes in
environmentally sensitive areas, saying the only measure 'rogue operators'
would recognise was 'the possibility of getting caught'.
But Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, cautioned that such a step would
be 'extremely expensive'. Radar surveillance in the English channel had been
effective in reducing accidents there by 85 per cent, he said.
The exchanges followed last month's incident when the oil tanker Braer was
wrecked off the Shetland Islands.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour warns on social chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH confirmed yesterday that the Labour leadership would seek to
derail the government's legislation implementing the Maastricht Treaty by
defeating it over Britain's opt-out from the social chapter, Philip Stephens
writes.
His comments, published in today's issue of The Times, raised the
possibility that an alliance of opposition parties and Tory Euro-sceptics
could force the government either to drop ratification or to seek
renegotiation of the treaty.
Mr Smith insisted that Britain could still ratify the agreement if the
government was defeated over the special protocol it negotiated to exclude
it from the social provisions of the treaty. He said that other European
states would allow the government to drop the opt-out protocol and then
press ahead with ratification of the treaty.
But that view was flatly rejected both by the government and by the Tory
Euro-sceptics who are determined to defeat the treaty. Displaying a rare
consensus, ministers and Tory back-bench rebels concurred that if Mr Smith
was successful Mr John Major would be unable to ratify Maastricht.
Ministers said that Denmark inevitably would take advantage of any
renegotiation to seek the inclusion in a new treaty of the informal opt-outs
from Maastricht it secured at last December's Edinburgh summit. In those
circumstances the whole process might unravel.
Senior Tory party managers acknowledged last night that the House of Commons
vote on the social chapter, expected next month, would seriously threaten
the government's majority. The Liberal Democrats have up to now indicated
that they are prepared to vote with Labour against the government.
But Mr Major may be able to rely upon the intense opposition of Tory
constituency associations to the social chapter to limit the number of
rebels on his own backbenches.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rising star fighting for the free
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE political winner has emerged from the government's planned review of
public spending before it has started. Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary
to the Treasury, has confirmed his status as the cabinet's fastest-rising
star.
It was he who suggested to colleagues last summer that the appalling state
of government finances called for a fundamental reassessment of the way it
spends Pounds 250bn a year of taxpayers' money.
Most of big spenders were happy to sign up, persuaded that a long-term
review was one of the safer ways to defer the awkward choices facing an
increasingly spendthrift government in the midst of recession. They may come
to regret that judgment.
Mr Portillo had other ideas. Still three months from his 40th birthday he is
the youngest, and technically the most junior minister in the cabinet.
He is also one of its brightest, most hard-working and ideologically
committed members - determined to advance in tandem his political career and
the cause of aggressively free-market Conservatism.
His review may serve both causes. Mr Portillo understands more clearly than
many that the philosophical direction of any government depends crucially on
the level of its spending commitments and the priorities to which they are
aimed. Within a few months he will have a better grasp of the implications
of present spending programmes than anyone else in government.
The chief secretary appreciates also that economic chaos provides one of the
most powerful forces for change in the Conservative party: it is only then
that Tory MPs have to face up to the choice between unpalatable cuts in
public spending and ruinous increases in taxation.
So Mr Portillo used the launch of the review - focusing at first on the
social security, health, education and home office budgets - to re-open the
political debate about the limits of the welfare state.
No one doubts where Mr Portillo stands personally. A conviction politician,
he would like to see a further decisive tilt away from the state and towards
the individual - in education, in social welfare and in health. He would
like further cuts in taxation and closer targeting of welfare benefits. He
is not so naive as to believe the review will transform overnight a timid
government into a radical one. The state pension and child benefit - two
main components of the welfare budget - are protected until the next
election by manifesto commitments.
But Mr Portillo understands that one of the lessons of the 1980s is that if
the climate of opinion is carefully managed in advance the radical can be
translated into the reasonable view. His sights are on the Tory party in 10
years. By then he could be leading it.
A few Tory MPs are already tipping him to replace Mr Norman Lamont in a
summer reshuffle. Such rapid promotion is probably premature. Mr Major may
well be loath to mark him out as heir-apparent. But, as he stressed in the
Commons yesterday, Mr Portillo is looking to the medium term.

DISTRICT councils in Wales have been so successful in collecting the poll
tax in the current financial year that receipts exceeded the estimated
amount by Pounds 16m, Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, disclosed in the
Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
He said the money would be used to reduce the burden of the council tax,
which will replace the poll tax in April.
Mr Hunt again insisted that the Pounds 2.6bn the government would provide
for local government services in Wales in the coming financial year should
ensure 'reasonable' council tax bills.
He stressed that 90 per cent of all local authority revenue expenditure
would be funded by central government support, and enable just over Pounds
900 to be spent on every man, woman and child in Wales.
Mr Ron Davies, Labour's shadow Welsh secretary, strongly disputed the
minister's claim that the level of grant should make it unnecessary for any
local authority to cut capital spending programmes.
Mr Davies maintained that the money being provided by the government would
not be adequate to allow vital public services to be retained, and result,
at a conservative estimate, in the destruction of some 2,500 jobs in the
public sector.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Viewing in about 9.5m homes expected by 2000: FT Satellite
Monitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 9.5m homes in the UK will be able to watch satellite television by the
year 2000, the latest forecasts from Continental Research show.
The number is down on the forecast made by Continental in November 1990,
when the market research group thought the total would be 10.3m. The
revision has been made because of slower growth last year.
Of the 9.5m homes in the latest forecast - 45 per cent of the UK total  -
6.8m receive the new television channels via their own dish or communal
aerial system and the remaining 2.7m from cable.
The latest FT Satellite Monitor, produced by Continental Research, estimates
that gross sales and rental of satellite dishes in January totalled 65,000
compared with 70,000 in January last year.
Continental estimates that 17,000 of total retail sales last month were
upgrades of equipment, replacements of existing equipment or renewals after
a break in subscription.
This gives a net increase for the month of 48,000. Continental also found a
growth of interest from a low level in December with more than 300,000
households saying they would install satellite television.
Interest may have been stimulated by satellite coverage of the present
England cricket tour of India.
The latest Continental figures coincide with the publication by Broadcasting
Audience Research Bureau, which produces official broadcasting ratings, of a
paper reviewing the work of the three organisations regularly monitoring the
growth of the satellite television market. They are Continental, Barb and
GfK, the German-owned market research group.
BARB estimates are derived from 3,500 face-to-face interviews in the home
each month and cover the entire UK for all forms of reception.
Barb figures for February 1 estimate that 3.05m homes can receive satellite
television, including all form of cable distribution.
The latest figure for satellite dishes is 2.323m, an increase of 26,000
since the beginning of January. GfK, sponsored by the ITV Association, uses
a series of 10,000 home random samples at six month intervals. These surveys
are supplemented by projections from sales data obtained from retail audits
and a sample of purchasing behaviour in 25,000 homes.
GfK figures exclude Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man, which could add 50,000 to 60,000 dishes to the total.
The latest GfK figures suggest that by November 21 dish ownership totalled
2.01m.
Barb believes the single most important number for estimating the size of
the emerging market is the number of satellite dishes for private homes.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Wages of security guards rise 3.2%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE hourly wage for security guards has risen by 3.2 per cent to
Pounds 3.50 in the past six months, according to a British Security Industry
Association survey.
Mr David Fletcher, chief executive of the association, said higher wages
were usually paid once customers recognised they were essential for quality
service. Lower wages often lead to higher staff turnover and a consequent
drop in experience and standards, he added.

MEMBERS of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation have rejected revised plans
for performance pay.
They voted by 34,147 to 6,588 to back a campaign of non-co-operation. The
Revenue was one of the first government departments to introduce a
performance-pay system, but after complaints from both staff and managers
revised proposals were introduced on an experimental basis.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Shell Oil move in US legal fight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL Oil has petitioned the California Appeals Court to re-hear some issues
raised in its case with insurers who include underwriters at Lloyd's of
London. The case concerns the cost of cleaning up pollution at the Rocky
Mountain Arsenal site in Colorado where Shell makes pesticides.
In the 1980s the US Environmental Protection Agency ordered the company to
clean the site. Its insurers refused to meet the cost.
The court ruled last month that Shell could not collect on insurance
policies that it had bought after 1969, when insurers introduced a clause
limiting coverage for pollution caused by 'sudden and accidental' release of
pollutant.
The judge referred to a lower court issues relating to coverage for
pollution between 1952, when Shell started manufacturing pesticides at the
plant, and 1969, opening the possibility that Shell might claim on its older
policies.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Lautro fines life group Pounds 80,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIBERTY LIFE, the life assurance group, has been fined Pounds 80,000 by
Lautro, the industry regulator, for failing to screen its direct sales staff
adequately before recruiting them, John Authers writes.
Lautro also said Liberty Life failed to control its internal affairs
responsibly, and that it did not ensure its sales force was properly
supervised.
Liberty Life stopped recruiting sales staff for three months in mid 1992 to
demonstrate to Lautro that its screening procedures had been reviewed. It
has paid Pounds 5,000 compensation to 46 investors who were sold the wrong
products.
Mr David Pritchard, sales director, said that previously the company had not
checked the financial background of its recruits as thoroughly as it should
have done.
The fine follows a series of penalties imposed on life groups for inadequate
control of separately managed tied agents. London &amp; Manchester was fined
Pounds 80,000, Guardian Royal Exchange had to pay Pounds 100,000 and
Scottish Widows was fined Pounds 120,000.

to limit motorcycle power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A Labour MEP yesterday donned motorcycle leathers and climbed on to a
British-built Triumph Daytona to protest at EC plans to limit motorcycle
power. Today Mr Roger Barton, MEP for Sheffield, will wear his leathers when
he addresses the European parliament in Strasbourg about the issue.
The parliament is to debate the resumed first reading of a bill which would
restrict motorcycles to no more than 100 brake horsepower. This would outlaw
some of the more powerful motorcycles manufactured by Triumph in the UK and
other makers elsewhere. Triumph said five of its eight models would be
affected by the limits. The British Motorcyclists Federation deplored the
proposed legislation.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Tesco may challenge over video sale ruling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of a child by trading standards officers as an agent provocateur to
catch retailers illegally selling goods to children such as video films
classified for adults was upheld by the High Court yesterday.
Lord Justice Staughton, sitting with Mr Justice Buckley, rejected an appeal
by Tesco, the supermarket chain, against a conviction by magistrates in
Willesden, north London, for supplying an 18-rated film to a boy of 14.
Lord Justice Staughton said the boy was given Pounds 10 by a trading
standards official and told to buy a video with an 18 classification. He was
told to give his true age if asked.
The boy obtained the video and Tesco was later found guilty of a breach of
the 1984 Video Recordings Act, fined Pounds 750 and ordered to pay Pounds
416 in costs.
Tesco argued that if the boy was acting as an agent for the officer, the
video was supplied to the official, not the boy, and was therefore lawful.
Tesco said it was considering challenging the ruling in the House of Lords
as 'a matter of general public importance'.
Lord Justice Staughton said it was no doubt 'fairly common for children to
arrive at shops and say they wish to buy cigarettes or alcohol for a parent
or some of other adult, and the same may happen with video recordings'.
Even if the child was telling the truth, it was doubtful that it could be
said that the supply was to the adult and not the child.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Adam Smith Institute says BBC should be floated on Stock
Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC should be floated on the Stock Exchange as a single company licensed
to broadcast two television channels and five radio stations, the Adam Smith
Institute, the rightwing think tank, says today.
Transfer of ownership 'into the hands of millions of ordinary shareholders'
would not only raise 'huge sums' for the Treasury but would take the BBC out
of the political domain.
The report argues that the BBC should be funded by advertising, but the
transition from licence fee funding could be phased over 10 years. The
licence fee system means the BBC 'is not liable to any penalty for failure
to provide what the general public want to see or for that matter to reap
the rewards'.
The study rejects the idea that there would not be enough advertising to
support the BBC and the existing commercial broadcasters.
As the BBC becomes a privatised corporation, public service broadcasting
should be opened up to competition. An Arts Council of the Air - possibly an
offshoot of the existing Arts Council - which would channel funds for public
service broadcasts. Organisations, including the BBC, would submit bids to
produce such works. Overall the report concludes the proposals would take
broadcasting in Britain a large step towards a free market system.

FT  09 FEB 93 / First speed-trap camera case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL HISTORY was made yesterday with the first prosecution of a speeding
driver based on evidence from the new controversial speed-trap cameras.
According to police in west London the cameras, four of which are rotated at
42 sites, have cut accidents significantly since their introduction in
October last year.
At Ealing magistrates court Mr Stephen Quashie, 19, of Harlesden, north-west
London, pleaded guilty to driving at 78mph on the A40 Western Avenue which
has a 50mph limit.
He told the court that on October 31 he had been rushing to see his pregnant
ex-girlfriend in Hammersmith Hospital when he was caught on film.
He said: 'It was 1.15am in the morning. There were hardly any cars on the
road. I thought it would be all right.'
He was fined Pounds 156, plus costs of Pounds 25, and given six penalty
points.
The chairman of the bench Wiktor Lewanski said the fine 'reflects the
seriousness with which this offence is being viewed'.
Afterwards Mr Quashie said he was surprised at the size of the fine but
philosophical about the use of cameras.
He added: 'They are there to do the job and they have done their job.'
But he admitted he did not think he had been caught as he did not think
there was a camera in spite of the police signs.
Afterwards the police said: 'Since their introduction on October 15 there
has been a 38 per cent drop in accidents, a 46 per cent drop in casualties
and most spectacularly a 60 per cent drop in those killed or seriously
injured.'
He went on: 'Motorists have reduced their speed by about 10 per cent so
accidents are that much less serious.'
He denied they were being used to increase the number of drivers caught,
pointing out their presence obviously reduced speed.
On average 250 cases are being detected each week by the four cameras
rotated in the 42 sites in west London.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Migraine costs at more than Pounds 600m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS who suffer from migraines cost their employers between Pounds 611m
and Pounds 741m a year in lost working time and reduced productivity,
according to research led by Dr Roger Cull, a consultant neurologist at
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
There are an estimated 3.5m adult migraine sufferers in the UK, of whom
about 2.3m are in work. The cost to the National Health Service of dealing
with migraine is relatively small - between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m a
year, says the Office of Health Economics.
The study of the cost to employers, published in the British Journal of
Medical Economics, found male sufferers lost an average of 5.6 working days
because of attacks. That comprised 1.5 complete days off work and the
equivalent of 4.1 days lost through reduced efficiency. Female sufferers
lost an average of 6.7 days.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Companies fight VAT decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of British businesses plans an intensive campaign against
Customs and Excise's decision late last year to restrict the value added tax
that holding companies can claim back.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, proposes to orchestrate a Pounds
250,000 campaign involving lobbying and opposition in the courts.
Ms Penny Hamilton, a partner in Coopers' VAT unit, said: 'This is a legally
unsound policy which is uncertain in application. We are not going to give
up to it without a fight.'
Representatives of nearly 100 clients which are likely to lose tax rebates
because of the decision, which comes into force in March, yesterday attended
a campaign launch in London.
Coopers intends to identify one of the consortium members, press Customs
into making an assessment under the new arrangements and then take an appeal
as far as the European Court of Justice, with financial backing from the
other members.
Customs issued a press release in October declaring that holding companies
that own operating subsidiaries within a group would no longer be entitled
to recover VAT incurred - mainly on professionals' fees - during their
'basic business activities'.
Acquiring and disposing of shares, mounting or defending against takeovers
and managing the affairs of subsidiaries would all be excluded from VAT
recoveries under the tougher approach.
The move by Customs followed interpretation by officials of the wider
applications of a ruling by the European Court of Justice concerning a pure
holding company called Polysar.
Customs claimed the court's ruling determined that the mere purchase and
holding of shares was not an economic or business activity and its role was
therefore no different from that of a private shareholder.
Opponents complain that Customs' new guidelines are unclear, inconsistent,
highly costly and were announced only through press releases without any
debate.
A Coopers' proposal document circulated yesterday says the firm will lobby
industry groups, ministers, government officials in London and Brussels and
the press as part of the campaign.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Tecs aim to renew companies link
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIVATE company is being established to act as a broker between Training
and Enterprise Councils, which deliver government training schemes in
England and Wales, and large providers of training for young people and
unemployed adults.
Many national companies that had offered training, particularly to young
people on Youth Training, pulled out of the scheme when Tecs took over
responsibility for the government-funded programmes.
Companies including Midland Bank and the Debenhams and Dixons retail groups
complained that they had to sign separate and often widely differing
contracts with up to 82 Tecs if they wanted to take on trainees round the
country. Previously the government had contracted with them centrally
through its National Providers Unit. The Department of Employment said
yesterday the unit had not been privatised. Tecs and providers had
'disengaged' the responsibility from the government.
According to an interview in Personnel Today, the magazine for specialist
personnel staff, the new company will be called the National Training
Partnership.
Mr Roger Shaw, president of the British Printing Industry Federation, who
will be one of the directors of the new body, said companies that had
dropped out of Youth Training were expressing fresh interest.
The government is expected within the week to announce the successor body to
the National Training Task Force. The voluntary body, under the chairmanship
of Sir Brian Woolfson, advised the government on establishing Tecs.

FT  09 FEB 93 / BR manager slams sell-off proposals: Separation of track and
operations is 'folly'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR British Rail manager hoping to lead a buy-out of one of BR's
busiest InterCity routes has publicly denounced the government's
privatisation plans as unworkable.
Mr Brian Scott, director of InterCity's Great Western division, describes
the proposed separation of track and operations as 'folly' and warns that a
'spiral of decline' caused by lack of investment will prevent anyone making
profits from Great Western.
The attack is significant because it comes from the head of one of the seven
BR routes last week designated by the government as the first candidates for
privatisation in 1994. Mr Scott plans to lead a management bid for the
franchise to operate Great Western's main line services from London
Paddington to much of south-west England and Wales. In letter to Mr John
MacGregor, the transport secretary, Mr Scott says he is not against
privatisation but believes impediments to running a successful private
railway must be removed.
His strongest criticisms are aimed at the government's plan to transfer
control of the tracks from train operators to a new track authority.
'As an experienced, professional railway business manager I would not put my
money into a train operating company - running a high-speed intensive
service such as Great Western - without having day-to-day command and
control of operations including signalling and track and track maintenance,'
he said.
'Whoever runs the business would be committing an act of folly to buy into
something with so little control of performance, and therefore, profit.'
Mr Scott also attacked the climate for investment, saying the private sector
will have no incentive to invest in assets with a lifespan of up to 30 years
if franchises last only five to 10 years.
Investment in Great Western, he says, needs to rise from Pounds 20m to
Pounds 60m a year just to replace existing assets: 'If this increase in
investment is not under way within three years, a spiral of decline will
prevent anyone making profits on Great Western.'
British Rail yesterday tacitly supported Mr Scott's criticisms by
distributing copies of his letter to the media and acknowledging that it had
been seen by Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, and Mr Chris Green, InterCity
director. However, it said that Mr Scott was not writing on behalf of BR.
The attack comes as MPs begin their consideration of the Railways Bill
today.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Heseltine gives pledge on environmental targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday told a Commons
committee that the UK would meet international environmental targets, but
declined to explain how they would be met because of the imminent
publication of the white paper on the coal industry.
Mr Heseltine added that he could not promise the environment committee that
emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants would not increase because
of the review, which is examining whether any of the 31 coal mines listed
for closure in October can be saved.
The UK is committed as part of EC policy and treaties signed at last July's
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide at
1990 levels by the year 2000, and to curbing discharges of sulphur dioxide
and of nitrogen oxides.
Coal-fired power stations produce more of these pollutants than gas-fired or
nuclear power stations, and British coal produces more than overseas coal.
In answer to an accusation by Mr Nick Raynsford, Labour MP for Greenwich,
that if the government reprieved some pits it would be 'virtually
impossible' for it to keep to the targets, Mr Heseltine said that the white
paper would address the issues and that they were also the responsibility of
the environment and transport departments. He said the government targets
were to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by 15 per cent of 1980 levels by
1993 and by 30 per cent by 1998. But he said the government was not
convinced that the technology to reduce these discharges now mandatory in
Continental countries was the best available.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, added that the UK had spent Pounds 500m in
the past five years on clean-coal technology.
Asked why his statement in October on the British Coal cuts did not mention
environmental issues, Mr Heseltine replied: 'One was concerned . . . with
the coal industry and the local communities.'

FT  09 FEB 93 / Fight against move on VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of British businesses plans to campaign against Customs and
Excise's decision late last year to restrict the value added tax that
holding companies can claim back.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, proposes to orchestrate a Pounds
250,000 campaign involving lobbying and opposition in the courts.
Ms Penny Hamilton, a partner in Coopers' VAT unit, said: 'This is a legally
unsound policy which is uncertain in application. We are not going to give
up to it without a fight.'
Representatives of nearly 100 clients, which are likely to lose tax rebates
because of the decision, which comes into force in March, yesterday attended
a campaign launch in London. Coopers intends to identify one of the
consortium members, press Customs into making an assessment under the new
arrangements and then take an appeal as far as the European Court of
Justice, with financial backing from the other members.
Customs ruled in October that holding companies which own operating
subsidiaries within a group would no longer be entitled to recover VAT
incurred - mainly on professionals' fees - during their 'basic business
activities'.
Acquiring and disposing of shares, mounting or defending against takeovers
and managing the affairs of subsidiaries would all be excluded from VAT
recoveries under the tougher approach.
The move by Customs followed interpretation of the wider applications of a
ruling by the European Court of Justice concerning a pure holding company
called Polysar.
Customs claimed the court's ruling determined that the mere purchase and
holding of shares was not an economic or business activity and its role was
therefore the same as that of a private shareholder.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Roadbuilders warned on contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION companies working for the government may have to take a greater
share of the economic risks in roadbuilding contracts, Mr Patrick Brown,
permanent secretary at the Department of Transport, warned yesterday.
He told members of the Commons public accounts committee that the cost of
roadbuilding contracts had overshot their tender estimates by 28 per cent
last year - equivalent to Pounds 85m.
Most of this cost - which was borne by the department - had been due to
unforeseen ground conditions or mistakes in design and construction, he
said.
Nevertheless, with the department facing criticism that it was failing to
monitor these construction projects sufficiently, Mr Brown said pilot
schemes were being run in which construction companies will bear the cost of
any overrun themselves.
'We are not talking about simple cost overrun,' Mr Brown added, insisting
that since roadbuilding was a 'dynamic piece of construction' it was
impossible to assess the scale of these engineering risks at the time of the
tender. Most of these overruns had occurred on the largest projects, he
said.
Additional sources of finance to fund Britain's roadbuilding programme may
be needed by the end of the century if congestion on motorways and trunk
roads is to be avoided, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told MPs
yesterday. 'We have to see whether private finance can augment public
finance,' he said, responding to opposition calls to clarify whether the
government was considering introducing road tolls as an environmental
measure or to raise Treasury revenues.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Profit-related pay schemes increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of profit-related pay schemes jumped by more than a quarter in
the final three months of last year, according to figures released yesterday
by the Inland Revenue.
The number of schemes increased by 27 per cent from 3,268 to 4,149 by the
end of December. Over the same period, the number of employees participating
in registered schemes rose by 24 per cent from 780,600 to 973,000.
The sharp rise comes after a long period of stability in the figures.
However, the rise had been anticipated as anecdotal evidence had pointed to
a substantial increase in inquiries about the schemes to accountants in the
past few months.
The new figures follow changes in the 1991 Budget which significantly
increased the tax-free profit payments allowed under approved schemes. These
are now possible up to either 20 per cent of pay or Pounds 4,000, whichever
is lower.
It may also reflect the fact that companies can use the schemes as a highly
tax-efficient way to increase benefits to their employees at a time when
profits are stagnating.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: 'These
figures are very good news and strongly indicate that many employers are
seeing the benefit of involving their employees in the running of the
business.'
Profit-related pay schemes were first introduced in 1988, and the formula by
which each one increases employee pay has to be approved by the Revenue.
Officials clamped down late last year on the abuse of some of these
formulas.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Unions fear worst for Daf vans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS FEAR that Leyland Daf's van production plant in Birmingham will
close, although they believe its axle plant in Glasgow and its truck
assembly plant in Leyland, Lancashire will be saved.
The fears were voiced as the Dutch administrators of Daf, the beleaguered
Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker, warned that more than half of the jobs
at the Dutch and Belgian operations would be eliminated.
Mr Louis Deterink and Mr Friso Meeter, the court-appointed administrators,
said the jobs would be cut as part of a rescue plan aimed at forming a new
limited company - 'New Daf' - comprising the 'core operations' of Daf's
Dutch and Belgian medium and heavy duty truck activities.
The Dutch administrators said consultations had taken place with Mr John
Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, the joint UK administrative receivers of Daf
'to see if - and if so how - activities in the UK can be absorbed by New
Daf.'
It is understood that the Leyland plant would be the main candidate for
inclusion in New Daf, although probably with a considerable cut in the 2,200
strong workforce.
The overall fate of the UK operations with more than 5,500 jobs therefore
remains uncertain.
The receiver is expected to announce a decision this Friday, and the unions
are preparing an intense lobbying campaign over the next few days.
Today Leyland Daf shop stewards are to meet Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade
and industry secretary, and union officials tomorrow are due to have
discussions with the receiver. On Thursday union leaders travel to Eindhoven
for talks with the main Daf board in the Netherlands.
The Birmingham van plant with its 2,000 jobs appears most at risk - Daf was
facing an investment of about Pounds 100m to modernise it for a new van
range that had been under development with Renault of France.
But jobs are also at risk outside the UK. Daf has more than 5,000 employees
at Eindhoven in the Netherlands and about 1,500 employees at Westerlo,
Belgium, where it assembles cabs and axles.
The administrators said they expected the total number of these jobs to be
'at least halved'.
The administrators said Daf Finance, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Daf
group, would be 'run down and closed'.
They did not specify if this included Leyland Daf Finance, its UK
subsidiary, which is not in receivership in the UK but which last week
closed its five UK regional offices.
British union leaders are particularly concerned about the prospect that
members losing jobs in Daf's UK operations might receive no redundancy pay.
The TGWU general union estimates that - if the company met its redundancy
obligations - it would cost Pounds 27m for a complete closure of all the
plants.
As Leyland Daf is in the hands of the receiver, no company redundancy money
will be forthcoming. Workers will be able to receive only state redundancy
help after 14 weeks.
Daf, which has more than 12,650 jobs mainly in the UK, the Netherlands and
in Belgium, was forced to file for protection from its creditors last week
after running up losses of more than Fl 800m in the past three years.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Builders 'forced to bid 10% below cost'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION companies desperate to win work and generate cash are bidding
prices on average 10 per cent below what jobs are expected to cost, Gardiner
&amp; Theobald, the leading firm of quantity surveyors, said yesterday.
Gardiner &amp; Theobald warned that customers which accepted unrealistic prices
could suffer as contractors then sought to recover their costs as work
progressed.
Mr Tony Burton, a partner, said: 'Either contractors will go bust or they
will have to find another way of squeezing cash out of the job. This could
be achieved by trying to pass the pain on to subcontractors which themselves
could fail; or, by pursuing legal claims for extra payments because of
variations introduced to original designs which arise on almost every job.
Either way it is unlikely to be good news for the customer.'
Gardiner &amp; Theobald, which publishes price indices that are quarterly based
on reports from more than 2,000 specialist contractors, warned that
fixed-price jobs could come under pressure if building material prices rose
because of sterling's devaluation or reduced capacity among domestic
suppliers.
The firm estimated that imported materials accounted for between 20 per cent
and 30 per cent of the cost of a commercial development.
It said: 'In theory the devaluation of the pound could add 4 per cent to 5
per cent to the cost of a project. It is unlikely, however, that the full
effect will be passed on and there is evidence that overseas contractors are
finding that they can no longer afford to tender in sterling in the UK
market.'
The recession had led to closures and mothballing of plants by building
material suppliers and the erosion of over-capacity should see prices rise,
they added.
Mr Burton said: 'One cladding company recently reported that it had reduced
its operations so much that if they were to win one more large project they
would be at full capacity and therefore able to consider raising their
prices.
'A steel contractor reported that his sector of the industry was at last
getting the message that buying business is a fruitless exercise and that
prices are tending to rise as a consequence.'
Gardiner &amp; Theobald forecasts that tender prices would rise by 3 per cent
this year after a fall of 1 per cent last year. It said that construction
tenders had fallen by an average 30 per cent in real terms since 1989.
Increases in the price of steel, glass and plasterboard have been announced
by building material producers in the past month.
Of these, the plasterboard increases, announced by BPB Industries, Europe's
biggest producer, seem most likely to stick. Rises announced by British
Steel and Pilkington are likely to face opposition from contractors which
will seek alternative suppliers overseas.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Pressure mounts over reform of leasehold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE LANDLORDS and tenants with long leases will today renew their battle
to swing the government's leasehold reforms in their favour, when all MPs
have their first chance to discuss and vote on the details of the plans.
Groups of Tory backbenchers on both sides of the argument have put down
amendments to the Housing and Urban Regeneration Bill, which includes giving
tenants the right to club together to buy the freehold of their block of
flats or the right to extend their leases.
Labour is unlikely to support changes to favour the landlords, so it is the
moves on behalf of the tenants' lobby that threaten the government's 21
majority. Potential Tory rebels say up to 20 backbench Tories are
sympathetic to their cause.
The point on which ministers are most likely to give way - and most are
reconciled to doing so - is abandoning the low-rent test provision. This is
one of the proposed criteria to determine whether leaseholders qualify for
the right to buy the freehold of the property, but the rebels argue that the
rule is artificial.
Ministers have argued that the purpose of the low-rent rule is to
distinguish between long leases where the tenant pays a premium at the
beginning and then pays a low ground rent, and the different sort of
interest held by a tenant who is on a long lease but paying a market rent.
Only properties with a low ground rent qualify under the proposals.
The tenants' lobby is also renewing its pressure on the government to change
the rule which means that tenants would not qualify if more than 10 per cent
of the property was in non-residential use.
On the landlords' side, Tory MPs led by former ministers including Sir Jerry
Wiggin and Mr Kenneth Baker have proposed changes that restrict the new
rights to flats which are the principal residence of tenants. However,
ministers are unlikely to accept the change.
In spite of the prospect of rebellions, government whips do not believe that
the legislation itself is in jeopardy because it fulfils so many manifesto
commitments. Instead, the landlords' lobby will simply step up their efforts
to win changes in the Lords, where the bill will be discussed shortly.

FT  09 FEB 93 / MPs seek wider Budget debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPS ARE considering plans to invite more open discussion of Budget proposals
by publishing draft clauses of the legislation weeks ahead of the official
announcement.
The all-party Treasury and Civil Service committee, said yesterday that the
idea of a 'budgetary green paper' will be among the issues it will consider
ahead of the unified Budget in December.
'A great chunk of every finance bill is taken up with merely correcting
mistakes of the past Budget,' said Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of
the committee. 'Obviously some things would have to be kept secret but much
of the finance bill is about technical changes which involve no pecuniary
advantage for anyone.'
The committee will also consider the impact of the unified Budget - the
Budget and Autumn Statement combined - on the timing of taxation decisions,
the implications for Treasury forecasting, the timing of the financial year
and the timing and progress through parliament of the finance bill, which
implements the Budget proposals.
In particular the committee will discuss what the December Budget means for
the timing of the local authority financial settlement announcement. Mr
Watts said MPs were worried that councils might receive very late
notification of what resources were available to them, making it difficult
to plan for the future.
The UK's longer leading index, which indicates turning points in the economy
about 11 months in advance, rose slightly in December. The Central
Statistical Office said the rise was due to the reduction in interest rates
since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism last September.
Higher share prices and an improvement in business optimism also boosted the
index.
The shorter leading index, pinpointing turning-points about four months in
advance, has also risen. This followed increases in new car registrations
and the results of the Confederation of British Industry survey of new
orders and expected changes in stocks of materials.
The coincident index, which tracks the business cycle, has hesitated,
according to the CSO, following its rise since spring 1992.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Merseyside will seek the same EC status as Corsica
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS from the five local authorities in Merseyside are pressing for the
region to be made a special case for development by the European Commission
because they say it is as economically weak as Corsica, Northern Ireland,
the Scottish Highlands and Molise in southern Italy - and getting weaker.
The officials want the EC to award the region with 'Objective 1' status so
that it qualifies for large-scale investment of community funds over the
next eight years. The money would be for economic development to counter 25
per cent male unemployment.
Objective 1 status is reserved for the EC's weakest areas. These are defined
as those that have a gross domestic product a head of only 75 per cent of
the EC average over a three-year period. Merseyside's GDP a head fell to an
average of 79 per cent of the EC average in 1989-90, the latest review
period, from 86 per cent in the mid 1980s.
The EC can award the status above the 75 per cent level in exceptional
circumstances. This has already happened in Northern Ireland (currently at
76 per cent) and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (79 per cent).
Although GDP a head in Merseyside is rising at present, the growth is at a
slower rate than elsewhere in the community, hence the region is falling
further behind.
Almost one-third of manufacturing jobs in Merseyside were lost between 1979
and 1990. One in four men is now unemployed and overall employment is 70 per
cent lower than the EC average and 50 per cent less than in the rest of the
UK.
Latest census data shows a 9 per cent drop in population between 1981 and
1991, against a rise of 2 per cent for the UK as a whole. Much of the
migration away from the region is of skilled or adaptable younger people.
The officials from the local authorities of Liverpool, Bootle, St Helens,
Wirral and Sefton, say that forecasts for employment and population in the
region to the end of the century suggest a greater decline than anywhere
else in the UK. The situation is therefore projected to worsen.
Objective 1 status is currently automatic for the whole of the Republic of
Ireland (65 per cent), Portugal (55 per cent) and Greece (48 per cent). It
also applies in Corsica and Molise - both 79 per cent - and Abruzzi, also in
southern Italy, where regional GDP is 88 per cent of the EC average.
The authority officials have made their case to the UK government, which is
reviewing the amount of assistance given to the region. It is hoped that
Merseyside's position will be considered by the EC's Council of Ministers in
June.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Consumers increase borrowings: 'Wise men' disagree about
taxes and interest rates; Statistics point to a slight improvement in the
economic outlook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

BORROWING BY individuals for consumer purchases rose for the second
consecutive month in December, pointing to a slight improvement in
willingness to take on new debts.
Official figures out yesterday showed that consumers borrowed a net Pounds
56m in December, compared with net borrowings of Pounds 13m in November and
a net repayment of Pounds 138m in December 1991.
The better-than-expected figures were released as the latest consensus
forecast for UK growth this year crept upwards. Average GDP forecasts among
34 economists, provided by Consensus Economics, a consultancy company, was
for growth of 1 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent next year. This year's
forecast has been revised upwards from last month's mean of 0.9 per cent.
Forecasts for France, Germany and Italy have been revised downwards.
The Central Statistical Office said the total rise in net credit in the
three months to the end of December was Pounds 136m compared with a net
repayment of Pounds 11m in the previous quarter. This suggests that lower
interest rates encouraged consumers to borrow more but did not stimulate a
rapid recovery in consumer spending.
The Treasury said the figures were encouraging: 'The figures suggest a rise
in borrowing by consumers in December accompanied by prudent reductions in
indebtedness.'
The seasonally adjusted figures - which do not include mortgages and account
for only about 15 per cent of total private sector debt - also showed a
small increase in the amount of new credit advanced to consumers by finance
houses, building societies and on credit cards that are part of the Visa or
Mastercard system. In December new credit advanced was Pounds 4.67bn,
slightly higher than November's Pounds 4.06bn.
Although the latest figures are slightly more optimistic, the level of
consumer borrowing remains depressed. A broader measure of credit growth,
which includes bank loans on personal accounts and lending by non-bank
credit cards, painted a more sombre picture. This showed a slowing in net
consumer credit growth in the latest quarter compared with the third quarter
last year. In the three months to the end of December, consumer lending
according to this measure expanded by Pounds 153m compared with Pounds 392m
in the previous three-month period.
The figures underlined expectations for a slow economic recovery as
consumers continue to make debt repayment a priority.

POVERTY, unemployment and homelessness increase the risk of young people
becoming involved in crime, the national crime prevention organisation Crime
Concern said yesterday, Alan Pike writes.
In evidence to a Commons home affairs committee investigation, the charity
said social factors such as poor parenting, family conflict and breakdown,
school failure and inadequate play provision affect crime.
Some inner-city areas and housing estates had a high proportion of
persistent youth crime and it was 'very difficult to bring up children in
such multi-disadvantaged neighbourhoods', it said.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Treasury advisers meet to mend strategy rift: 'Wise men'

improvement in the economic outlook
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE first policy meeting today of the Treasury's new panel of economic
advisers will seek to resolve serious splits among members on subjects such
as interest rates and possible tax increases.
The seven-strong group will also be divided on whether there should be large
cuts in public spending and on the best targets with which to monitor the
economy.
Several panel members say they want to find as many areas of consensus as
possible in their report on the economy, which will be handed to Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, on February 18. It will be made public the next day.
Today's meeting will be chaired by Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief
economic adviser. It will discuss a range of subjects, including numerical
forecasts and policy suggestions.
The panel was set up by Mr Lamont at the end of last year to inject greater
openness into Treasury decision-making. Its reports will be published about
every four months.
Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University is the keenest supporter
of lower base rates. He wants a cut from 6 per cent to 3 per cent by March
17, the day after the Budget.
Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank,
favours base rates of 5 per cent by the late spring, with more cuts possibly
later in the year.
But Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, the private-sector think tank, and Mr Andrew Sentance,
economics director at the Confederation of British Industry, support the
government in keeping interest rates stable at least until the Budget.
The other three members - Professor Tim Congdon, managing director of
Lombard Street Research, Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University and
Professor David Currie of London Business School - refrained from revealing
their views on interest rates ahead of the Budget.
While Mr Davies and Prof Congdon favour large tax rises over the next two
years to tackle the growing government deficit, most of the others oppose
any immediate action. Mr Britton said: 'The scare stories about the likely
large rise in the public sector borrowing requirement may be a poor guide to
policy.' Prof Minford said the government should cut taxes over the next few
years as part of 'supply side' reforms to strengthen the economy.
And while both the monetarists on the panel, Prof Minford and Prof Congdon,
want large cuts in public spending, Mr Britton thinks this might have to
rise above Treasury targets to accommodate 'overshooting'.
Mr Britton is the most optimistic about growth prospects this year,
predicting expansion in gross domestic product of about 2 per cent. Prof
Minford thinks that if interest rates stay relatively high and the
international economy remains fragile, UK output could fall by 0.5 per cent,
making 1993 the third successive year of economic decline.
Most panel members are extremely gloomy about unemployment, believing the
registered jobless total is unlikely to fall below 3m for some years.
Although several on the panel think the government's 4 per cent limit for
underlying inflation may be breached this year, most are generally sanguine
about inflationary trends.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Argentina putting privatisation in train: John Barham
explains how the country is preparing its railway system to be sold off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S taxpayers pay Dollars 1.6m (Pounds 1.05m) a day for their
filthy, overcrowded, crime-ridden, unreliable and dilapidated rail system,
which is not greatly different from what it was when it was nationalised in
1946-47.
But in less than three months, it will be all change.
When private operators start running the trains in May, the government hopes
that fares will stay low and service will improve, with more trains carrying
more passengers and freight in greater safety and comfort. It also hopes
subsidies will fall to Dollars 100m-150m a year.
Mr Jorge Kogan, an Argentine transport consultant retained by the World Bank
to design and carry out the privatisation, began by splitting up the rail
network, which was built by mainly British companies in the 19th century.
He is axing intercity passenger services, which will only survive if local
governments subsidise them. He split the long-distance freight service into
six lines and sold each as a separate 30-year concession that includes lines
and rolling stock.
But he realised he could hardly shut down the Buenos Aires commuter system,
which includes the underground network. Its 899km of track, 267 stations,
and more than 1m daily passengers costs Dollars 150-200m a year in
subsidies.
So Mr Kogan divided the network into seven lines, one of them including the
underground, to be sold as 10-year concessions. He established investment
and service targets and attracted seven contenders, which first had to
qualify on technical grounds, allowing him to weed out undesirables.
Remaining candidates then presented a business plan and finally bid against
one another, with the concession going to bidders requiring the lowest
subsidy.
Three groups won the bidding by demanding subsidies estimated at Dollars
993m over the concessions' 10-year lives. The Dollars 753.3m investment
subsidy will peak in the third and fourth years of the concession.
The Dollars 239.7m operating subsidy will disappear in the eighth year, when
the government will start charging Dollars 10m-worth of fees a year.
The government hopes to develop property along rail lines and revitalise the
rail terminals - which will all remain under its control - generating cash
to pay for the rail subsidies.
Mr Kogan says operators should find it easy to meet their targets by
'organising a system where people get what they want'. This means increasing
traffic - which fell to 4.5m journeys in 1991 from 6m in 1990 - by raising
the number of trains, and making them safer and more reliable.
This will lift revenues, which operators can also improve by halting the
estimated 30-50 per cent fare evasion.
The concession containing the underground is for 20 years and should be
profitable. The government will subsidise investments worth almost Dollars
400m, but will take in about the same amount in fees.
Meanwhile, the government has spent about Dollars 400m in severance pay to
sack half the system's 91,000 employees, with more job cuts still to come.
The World Bank lent Dollars 300m towards this. Mr Kogan said once-militant
unions 'realised it would be better to keep 25-30 per cent of their jobs
than losing all their jobs. Those remaining will be better paid and have
better working conditions.'
The government is setting up a regional authority to establish transport
policy and regulate the companies. Curiously, one the three consortia
includes Buenos Aires' independent bus operators - who should be the last
people to be interested in improving rail services.
However, Mr Kogan says they will reorganise their networks to feed the
trains, rather than competing with them. He insisted all operators should
have an established reputation, so the operators are all are foreign, such
as San Francisco's BART and Chicago's Burlington Northern Railroad.
Critics say the consortium's local members fail to inspire confidence. They
include little-known construction, consulting and electronics companies as
well as bus operators.
And unlike most of Argentina's recent sell-offs, the Buenos Aires commuter
privatisation has been mired in accusations of double-crossing and
corruption. One of the four losing consortia - which included British Rail -
claims the absence of effective World Bank oversight allowed winners to get
away with irresponsible underbidding. One loser doubts the undercapitalised
winners can comply with their targets, and predicts the network will
eventually return to the government.

FT  09 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Romanians in deal to build 11 BAC 1-11s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROMAERO, Romania's state-owned aircraft manufacturer, has won a contract to
make 11 BAC 1-11 jets, from Kiwi International Airlines, a US domestic air
carrier.
The contract is Romania's first order from a western company for the BAC
1-11 since it began making the medium-to-short haul jets under licence from
British Aerospace in 1982, Romaero said yesterday. Romaero, formerly known
as IRMA, is to update the BAC 1-11, using components and technical support
from British Aerospace, Alenia and Dee Howard, with Rolls-Royce supplying
the aircraft's engines.
The first delivery is due in November 1994. Kiwi has an option to buy five
more BAC 1-11s with delivery by June 1998, Romaero said. The companies have
not disclosed the value of the order.
Kiwi International, based in Newark, New Jersey, was set up by former
employees of Pan-Am, Eastern and Midway airlines.
It began operating last September with two leased Boeing 727 jets and flies
from Newark to Chicago, Detroit and Orlando, Florida.
Romaero said Kiwi planned to use the 104-seater jets to expand its services
to Los Angeles and possibly to medium-haul international destinations.
The deal is a boost to Romania's ailing aircraft manufacturing industry. The
nine BAC 1-11s produced since 1982 at Romaero's Baneasa plant outside
Bucharest were sold on the domestic market.
But Tarom, Romania's state-owned airline, has switched to foreign
manufacturers since the end of communist rule in 1989. It recently took
delivery of two Airbus Industrie A-310s and has placed orders for up to 13
Boeing 737-300s.
Romaero's other main activity is the manufacture of nine-seater Islander
aircraft under licence from Pilatus Britten-Norman, the Isle of
Wight-company. Romaero said it had produced around 500 Islanders since 1969,
including 11 last year.

FT  09 FEB 93 / World Trade News: EC, Japan 'far apart' on car imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN and the European Community have failed to agree a forecast for the
evolution of the EC car market in 1993, increasing the possibility of a
damaging dispute between the two partners over Japanese car imports.
Officials met last week to discuss the outlook for 1993, but broke up
inconclusively.
In November, the Japanese suggested EC sales might increase during 1993.
Since then, they have conceded that the outlook is more pessimistic, but EC
officials said yesterday the two sides were still far apart. The officials
will meet again in Tokyo early next month for further discussions.
Under the 1991 EC-Japan agreement on car imports, agreed forecasts form the
basis for Japan to 'monitor' its exports to the EC. The monitoring is part
of a deal to open the EC market gradually to full competition from Japan by
the end of the century.
European Commission officials said yesterday they hoped a delay of about a
month would allow them to collect more data on the first weeks of 1993.
Neither the Commission nor the Japanese would indicate how much they
expected EC car sales to decrease this year, but European manufacturers
expect them to decline by as much as 7.5 per cent.
According to the European industry, January sales dropped sharply compared
with 1992, partly because people bought new cars in December, to avoid
January tax increases in some EC countries. Germany's sales last month fell
by 30 per cent compared with the equivalent period in 1992, French sales
slipped by 37 per cent, Italian by 15 per cent and Spanish by 50 per cent;
British sales increased by 8 per cent.
But even if the two sides can agree on a 1993 forecast next month they are
still likely to argue about what action should be taken. Tokyo has always
disputed the EC's interpretation that in a shrinking market Japan should
absorb three-quarters of the reduction, by limiting exports.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Clinton may increase corporation taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's economic package may embrace an increase in
corporation taxes and some reductions in government employment, but will
almost certainly not include any freeze in the indexation of social security
pensions.
Seeking to regain the initiative after the controversy surrounding the
withdrawal of Judge Kimba Wood as a prospective attorney general, assorted
administration officials dropped hints about the composition of the
president's new programme, to be unveiled in next week's state of the union
message and in his first budget, due for March 23.
Mr George Stephanopoulos, White House communications director, said
yesterday it was 'very unlikely' that Mr Clinton would freeze pension
cost-of-living adjustments. 'That is something he has never wanted to do,'
he added, blaming unsubstantiated 'leaks' for implying that this was under
consideration.
He said increasing income taxes on pensions on wealthier older Americans,
another widely canvassed alternative to raise revenue and thus reduce the
budget deficit, was 'possible', if it could be made fair.
Mr Clinton was also going to call for an extension of long-term unemployment
benfits during a meeting yesterday with his economic advisers, Mr
Stephanopolous said.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House press secretary, also said yesterday that an
increase in the corporation tax - now 34 per cent - was under review. She
placed this in the context of the need to raise tax rates on both
individuals and corporations 'whose incomes went up the most and whose taxes
went down' during the 1980s.
She added that the administration was also looking into raising the federal
minimum wage - currently Dollars 4.25 an hour - but stressed that no
decisions had been made.
Ms Myers also echoed comments made over the weekend by Mr Robert Reich, the
labour secretary, that substantial cuts might be made in the White House
staff, partly to encourage other departments and Congress similarly to
reduce their payrolls.
Mr Reich had predicted that the White House staff cuts would be 'dramatic',
as much as 20-25 per cent. Already some lower-level bureaucrats in the
executive offices, handling routine matters like mail sorting, have been
given redundancy notices.
The thrust of all the comments was on the need to reduce the federal deficit
by eliminating waste. However, over the weekend, Mr Reich, Vice-President Al
Gore and Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, all spoke of the equivalent
imperative to create more jobs in the economy.

FT  09 FEB 93 / World Trade News: 'Fast track' link with rice attacked
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Agriculture Ministry yesterday condemned suggestions that the
extension of the US 'fast-track' trade mechanism should be linked to the
opening of the country's rice market to imports, writes Robert Thomson in
Tokyo.
Mr Akio Kyoya, a vice-minister of agriculture, said the ministry had heard
US officials wanted the rice market opened to ensure that the 'fast-track'
mechanism was extended beyond the end of May.
'The issues are totally irrelevant,' Mr Kyoya said, stressing that rice
should be discussed in multilateral negotiations, not in the context of US
domestic policy. The 'fast track' forces US Congress to accept or reject
agreements without clause-by-clause amendments, and aims to ensure speedy
passage of a Uruguay Round trade pact.
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has already decided, privately, that
rice imports are inevitable.
But the Agriculture Ministry was surprised last week when a senior official
of the Social Democratic Party, the largest opposition party, also said
imports might be allowed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday announced an overhaul of the White House's
environmental policy structure and a move to turn the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) into a full cabinet-level department.
'The days of photo-op environmentalism are over,' he said, announcing his
intention to abolish the Council on Environmental Quality, a White House
agency set up in 1969 to review environmental policies and report each year
on the condition of the environment.
He had already abolished the Competitiveness Council, another White House
agency which under the chairmanship of former Vice-President Dan Quayle
became one of the most important channels for setting environmental policy
in the Bush administration, and often blocked efforts by the EPA to
implement environmental protection regulations.
Vice-President Al Gore's views on environmental issues are almost
diametrically opposed to those of his predecessor, and he is expected to
remain the administration's most prominent spokesman in the field. About
half the employees of the Council on Environmental Quality are expected to
be kept on, in a streamlined environmental team merged into the general
White House policy structure.
Environmentalist groups appear happy with the decision, since they believe
integrating the environmental policy team into the White House structure may
lead to environmental issues being treated as less of an afterthought.
Mr Clinton has given cabinet status to Ms Carol Browner, EPA director. But
transforming the agency into a full cabinet-level department will require
legislation.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Brazil renews talks with IMF in hope of stand-by loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL yesterday reopened talks with the International Monetary Fund in the
hope of obtaining a new stand-by loan pact. Far from a certainty, given the
country's continuing economic instability, an IMF accord is crucial for
concluding an agreement with foreign bankers over restructuring Dollars 44bn
(Pounds 29bn) of commercial debt and for obtaining much-needed new
resources.
After spending yesterday with IMF staff, Mr Paulo Haddad, economy minister,
will today meet Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, the first
encounter between a representative of Brazil's new government and a top Fund
official.
Mr Haddad is unlikely to get a warm reception. Mr Camdessus has been
sympathetic to Brazil but patience with Latin America's biggest economy
seems to be wearing thin. The rapid collapse of Brazil's last stand-by
accord, agreed in January last year for Dollars 2.1bn, followed nine letters
of intent and two accords in 11 years.
Talks originally planned for December were cancelled because Mr Haddad had
no programme to present. The government is still developing its
anti-inflation plan, but Mr Haddad has a little more to show with the recent
passage of a fiscal reform bill through the lower house of Congress.
Rather than starting from scratch negotiating a new letter of intent, he
hopes to adapt the old agreement negotiated by his predecessor, Mr Marcilio
Marques Moreira. It is not likely to be easy. Unlike Mr Moreira, a close
friend of Mr Camdessus, Mr Haddad is unknown in Washington, and inflation
appears to be moving out of control.
Figures released by Sao Paulo University put inflation for January at 27.45
per cent, more than 2 percentage points up on December and more than the
previous accord predicted for the whole of this year.
Reuter adds from Washington: Mr Haddad said he was seeking Dollars 2bn from
the IMF and another Dollars 2bn from the World Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank this year.
He said Brazil needed Dollars 1.6bn to guarantee debt restructuring
negotiations with foreign banks; Dollars 1bn of that would come out of the
agencies' loans and the other Dollars 600m from Brazil's hard currency
reserves.

FT  09 FEB 93 / US intends to push for fair trade says Espy

<TEXT>
THE US agriculture secretary, Mr Mike Espy, said yesterday that the Clinton
administration's decision to slap duties on billions of dollars of imported
steel was just the start of its push to open markets and seek fair trade,
Reuter reports from Washington.
'This administration will insist that our trading partners and competitors
comply with trading rules that are fair and equitable,' Mr Espy told a
conference of the US Feed Grains Council.
'You've already seen some of the tough actions on steel import quotas and
other areas from our new trade representative, Mickey Kantor, and you can
expect more such decisions. The door to trade must swing both ways, and we
will tighten the hinges,' he said.
Mr Espy said that in agriculture he would 'move forcefully' to convince
countries protecting their grain markets that they should change those
polices.
He also restated - in stronger terms - that he wants to use US farm export
programmes full tilt until a global trade reform deal is struck under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He said 'it would be in my judgment
a serious mistake' to cut those programmes to try to reduce the deficit
unless the Gatt agreement is reached.
Nancy Dunne in Washington adds: US trade officials yesterday assured Mr
Michael Wilson, Canadian trade minister, of their determination to pursue an
early conclusion to Gatt's Uruguay Round and side agreements to the North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
After meeting Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, and Mr Mickey Kantor, the US
trade representative, Mr Wilson said that the Clinton administration would
soon seek an extension of the 'fast track' negotiating authority, which
expires in May. 'It is being discussed with Congress right now,' Mr Wilson
said.
The authority blocks Congress from amending trade agreements.

FT  09 FEB 93 / World Trade News: EC-Japan row over car imports likely -
Drive to agree market forecast fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN and the European Community have failed to agree a forecast for the
evolution of the EC car market in 1993, increasing the possibility of a
damaging dispute between the two partners over Japanese car imports.
Officials met last week to discuss the outlook for 1993, but broke up
inconclusively.
In November, the Japanese suggested EC sales might increase during 1993.
Since then, they have conceded that the outlook is more pessimistic, but EC
officials said yesterday the two sides were still far apart. The officials
will meet again in Tokyo early next month for further discussions.
Under the 1991 EC-Japan agreement on car imports, agreed forecasts form the
basis for Japan to 'monitor' its exports to the EC.
The monitoring is part of a deal to open the EC market gradually to full
competition from Japan by the end of the century.
European Commission officials said yesterday they hoped a delay of about a
month would allow them to collect more data on the first weeks of 1993.
Neither the Commission nor the Japanese would indicate how much they
expected EC car sales to decrease this year, but European manufacturers
expect them to decline by as much as 7.5 per cent.
According to the European industry, January sales dropped sharply compared
with 1992, partly because people bought new cars in December, to avoid
January tax increases in some EC countries.
Germany's sales last month fell by 30 per cent compared with the equivalent
period in 1992, French sales slipped by 37 per cent, Italian by 15 per cent
and Spanish by 50 per cent; British sales increased by 8 per cent.
But even if the two sides can agree on a 1993 forecast next month they are
still likely to argue about what action should be taken. Tokyo has always
disputed the EC's interpretation that in a shrinking market Japan should
absorb three-quarters of the reduction, by limiting exports.
A year ago, the two sides agreed there would be a slight decline in EC sales
during 1992 and Japanese imports were held back in line with EC wishes. In
the event, the December surge meant slightly more cars were sold in the EC
during 1992 than in 1991.

FT  09 FEB 93 / World Trade News: India's private thoughts on power - Delhi
recognises that without improved electricity supply, the reform programme
will falter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FREE electricity is one of life's few blessings for slum dwellers in
Shahdara, east Delhi. It is easily obtained by scrambling up an electricity
pole and attaching a wire to the overhead mains. Occasionally someone gets
electrocuted in the process, but not often.
Electricity board officials turn a blind eye to such pilfering, which
happens all over India. The effort of collecting payment from slums is not
worth the revenues. Also, decades of socialist thinking have encouraged many
Indians to regard the mostly state-owned electricity distribution boards as
welfare agencies. Farmers in Karnataka state, south India, pay just 5 per
cent of cost for their current. In neighbouring Tamil Nadu they pay nothing.
The result is chronic losses for the industry and electricity shortages
leading to frequent power cuts for consumers.
However, the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the reform-minded prime
minister, is committed to overhauling the industry: it recognises that
without improved electricity supplies, the economic modernisation programme
will grind to a halt.
After years of relying on state-owned industry, Mr Rao is calling on private
companies - including foreign groups - to build and operate 100 per cent
privately owned power plants.
But business has so far been slow to respond. In the last year, the ministry
of power has attracted inquiries from 40 companies, including 25 from
abroad, interested in building and operating power stations with a total
capacity of 20,000 MW. But only four small-scale plants with a combined
capacity of 1,300 MW are under construction, all by Indian-owned companies;
four large projects totalling 8,000 MW and involving foreign capital, have
been approved by the government, but none is yet under way.
The cautious response is partly due to the huge scale of the proposed
investments and partly to doubts about the government's ability to overhaul
the industry's anti-commercial practices. Though ministers in Delhi are
committed to reform, many local politicians, who use cheap electricity to
buy farmers' votes, are not. As Mr S V Joshi, director of power distribution
at the Indian affiliate of Siemens, the German engineering group, says: 'It
took the US 10 years to switch from public to private sector power
generation. India can't do it in two or three.'
The government's 1992-1997 economic plan calls for the addition of 31,000 MW
of public sector generating capacity to the existing total 78,000 MW (which
includes 9,000 MW from private plants). But the public sector does not have
the funds to implement the plan. Even if it did, India would still be short
of electricity. Hence the need for private investors. As the head of the
Delhi office of a European engineering group says: 'If we can get it right,
the opportunities are limitless.'
Getting it right involves getting the finance right. With a large power
station costing Dollars 1bn and more, the only viable way for private
companies to fund such projects is to split the cost between different
equity partners and lenders, including multilateral institutions such as the
World Bank.
For example, Enron, the US energy group, is planning a Dollars 2bn plant for
Maharashtra state to supply Bombay. Enron is considering asking lenders for
80 per cent of the funds, with 20 per cent in equity split between three
partners - Enron, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and General
Electric, the US engineering group which would supply much of the equipment.
The World Bank, which has funded much of India's existing power capacity,
says it would support schemes involving private companies. Officials believe
public sector boards are generally poor managers - because of breakdowns,
Indian power plants run at an average of 60 per cent of their full capacity
and 23 per cent of their output is lost during transmission.
However, money alone will not persuade private companies to invest. They
also want to be certain their investments will be safe and they will get an
adequate return. The Indian government has proposed contracts which would
allow generating companies to pass on increases in fuel costs (the main
variable cost) and earn a minimum net annual profit of 16 per cent.
But most foreign companies say this is not enough. They are asking for
central government guarantees that they will be paid by the state-level
electricity boards, which are the main distributors. The companies are
worried because the electricity boards are controlled by local state
governments, which use electricity supply as a political tool. Foreign
companies are also concerned about the security of fuel supplies since most
plants will rely on coal from state-owned mines.
However, the central government has so far ruled out guarantees, saying the
answers lie mainly in watertight, legally enforceable contracts. The most
the power ministry will entertain is indirectly endorsing guarantees offered
by state governments. This may not be enough even for Enron.
Aware of such doubts, the power ministry this month ordered state
governments to permit private companies to enter into power distribution as
well as generation. This would allow private companies to supply, for
example, a selected group of consumers, such as factories on an industrial
estate - potentially an attractive option.
The ministry is considering further incentives to tempt foreign companies.
Officials also point to the success of the four Indian private companies in
the industry - the Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Company, the Calcutta
Electric Supply Company, Ahmedabad Electricity and Tata Electric Companies.
All are profitable and most are expanding capacity. Mr Joshi of Siemens
says: 'This proves India can do it.'
But no-one expects a quick transformation. Mr M Ranji, a senior power
ministry official says: 'There are no easy solutions. That's the cost of
democracy in India.'

FT  09 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Japanese condemn linking 'fast track' to
rice market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Agriculture Ministry yesterday condemned suggestions that the
extension of the US 'fast-track' trade mechanism should be linked to the
opening of the country's rice market to imports.
Mr Akio Kyoya, a vice-minister of agriculture, said the ministry had heard
US officials wanted the rice market opened to ensure that the 'fast-track'
mechanism was extended beyond the end of May.
'The issues are totally irrelevant,' Mr Kyoya said, stressing that rice
should be discussed in multilateral negotiations, not in the context of US
domestic policy. The 'fast track' forces US Congress to accept or reject
agreements without clause-by-clause amendments, and aims to ensure speedy
passage of a Uruguay Round trade pact.
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has already decided, privately, that
rice imports are inevitable. But the Agriculture Ministry, representing
farmers' interests, was surprised last week when a senior official of the
Social Democratic Party, the largest opposition party, also said imports
might be allowed.
Until then, the opposition party had publicly argued that the rice market
must remain closed in the interests of 'food security', and the party is
courting the farm vote for a general election, expected late this year.
Recent public opinion polls have shown most Japanese support a lifting of
the ban on imported rice, but the Agriculture Ministry has argued it would
be foolish to make a concession while the European Community and the US
cannot settle their disputes.
But the ministry has also begun investigating means of compensating rice
farmers who will be affected by imports. The policy is likely to include
subsidies to encourage farmers to switch crops, as well as increased funds
for farmers' co-operatives nationally.
Meanwhile, Mr Michio Watanabe, foreign minister, is preparing for a visit to
Washington on Thursday which he would like to centre on Japan's growing
international role, but which will probably deal with trade issues,
including rice.
Reuter adds from Tokyo: Japan strongly opposes a US proposal for a tenfold
rise in import duty on minivans, Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister at the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said. 'We strongly oppose (the
idea that) the US raise the import duty tenfold to 25 per cent. It might
violate (Gatt rules).'

FT  09 FEB 93 / Chung faces his toughest ordeal: John Burton assesses the
election funding indictment of Hyundai's founder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHUNG Ju-yung, the founder of South Korea's Hyundai business group, may
have to revise the title of his autobiography, Ordeals But No Failures. His
recent foray into politics, a source of further ordeals for the 77-year-old
industrialist, now threatens failure.
It has been a disastrous time for Mr Chung. He performed unexpectedly poorly
in the presidential election in December, finishing a distant third after a
lavish and expensive campaign.
He was then subject to a highly publicised and humiliating investigation for
alleged election violations that concluded with an indictment at the
weekend.
If Mr Chung is convicted of illegally receiving more than Dollars 60m
(Pounds 39.7m) in secret election funds from his shipbuilding subsidiary, he
could be stripped of his seat in the National Assembly and forced to
withdraw from politics.
Moreover, the United People's party (UPP), the opposition group he formed a
year ago, is already weakened by internal dissension after his failed
presidential bid. His departure as party leader could cause the UPP to split
or disintegrate.
Prosecutors say they have a strong case against Mr Chung, but the indictment
is still regarded as a government vendetta. Korean politics is notoriously
corrupt, with politicians often receiving secret corporate donations.
Mr Chung claims the money came from the sale of shareholdings in Hyundai
Heavy Industries, the shipbuilding unit.
Mr Chung greatly irritated the government when he launched his political
career last year. Officials, accustomed to giving orders to the nation's
large conglomerates or chaebol, did not like to see their authority
challenged.
They also suspected that Mr Chung was trying to win political power to
prevent the government from reducing the chaebol's economic clout, although
the Hyundai founder argued that he was campaigning for economic deregulation
and promised to break up the chaebol as part of this programme.
In addition, Mr Chung posed a political threat to the ruling Democratic
Liberal party by attracting conservative middle-class voters away from it
and possibly denying the presidential election to its candidate, Mr Kim
Young-sam.
This threat was blunted after the government revealed not long before the
election that it was investigating whether Hyundai was illegally diverting
funds to Mr Chung. Mr Kim won the election by a comfortable margin.
The prosecution of Mr Chung, if successful, would serve as a warning to
other chaebol not to get involved in politics. It could also prove
politically beneficial to the DLP since it may attract some of the UPP's 34
mainly conservative parliamentary members if Mr Chung's party collapses. The
switching of party affiliation is a common practice in Korean politics.
Defecting UPP members would increase the ruling party's slim parliamentary
majority of 163 seats in the 299-member chamber, while leaving the
Democratic party as the only main opposition group.
The UPP is already showing signs of splintering. Mr Chung's autocratic style
has been blamed by some party executives for the UPP's defeat. Several
prominent members, including Mr Kim Dong-gil, a popular academic who helped
establish the UPP, have threatened to leave unless Mr Chung steps down as
party chairman.
If Mr Chung is forced to retire, he may no longer be willing to fund the
UPP, depriving the party of its main financial support. He has already
failed to fulfil a promise to give another Won200bn (Pounds 170m) to the
party this year.
It is unlikely that the government will also try to punish Hyundai if it
manages to destroy the UPP with the indictment against Mr Chung. Hyundai was
the subject of tax penalties and credit squeezes last year in a government
attempt to intimidate Mr Chung to withdraw from the presidential election.
However, the government is trying to revive the flagging economy and
reprisals against Hyundai would harm that effort. Hyundai is Korea's largest
business group and its biggest motor vehicle maker, shipbuilder and
construction company.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Afghan factions resort to arms: Tribal warlords may
disregard external attempts to achieve lasting peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for lasting peace in Afghanistan have been considerably damaged by
three weeks of violence in which hundreds have been killed in rocket attacks
on Kabul, the capital.
Mujahideen guerrillas led by Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar yesterday launched the
heaviest bombardment of the recent fighting, killing and injuring dozens of
Kabul residents. Last week four United Nations workers were killed in an
ambush in eastern Afghanistan.
The escalation began after the interim president, Mr Burhannuddin Rabbani,
extended his term of office for two years through a vote of confidence from
a controversial shoora, or council of elders. Only four of the nine main
mujahideen factions attended the shoora and confirmed its decision.
Rivals of Mr Rabbani who are trying to remove him include Mr Hekmatyar,
leader of the fundamentalist Hezb-i-Islami party, and the Iranian-backed
Hezb-i-Wahdat group. The country's most powerful army general, Uzbek
commander Rashid Dostum, is also expected to join Mr Rabbani's opponents if
they win sufficient ground to form a government.
Yesterday, as Mr Hekmatyar stepped up his attacks, government jets circled
overhead on bombing raids against his headquarters to the south of Kabul.
Tanks patrolled the streets, according to a Reuters newsagency report from
Kabul.
Mr Hekmatyar has refused to stop fighting unless Mr Rabbani agrees to
elections within a year and formation of an interim government acceptable to
all mujahideen parties.
Regional powers are anxiously seeking an end to the fighting. Iran and
Pakistan want to see a stable government in Kabul so that more than 4.5m
Afghan refugees can return home. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has invited all
Afghan groups to the kingdom for discussions on a peaceful solution and
Pakistan has backed this proposal.
However, groups opposed to Mr Rabbani have said they will accept his
presence there only if he attends as head of his Jamiat-i-Islami party
rather than as president. He is not expected to agree.
Western diplomats and Pakistani officials say Mr Rabbani's continuation in
office is the biggest obstacle to negotiations. A government spokesman in
Islamabad says: 'We have conveyed to President Rabbani our deep anguish that
fighting has broken out and that it has not been possible to evolve a
consensus on political arrangements in Kabul.'
The crisis has dampened prospects for badly needed international assistance
in relief and reconstruction work.
The UN has launched an international appeal seeking Dollars 138m (Pounds
91.3m) in assistance. But Mr Sotorios Mousouris, the secretary general's
representative for Afghanistan, says: 'What I am worried about is that if
this situation continues for very long, the donors may be discouraged from
going along. If a country is put on the shelf, then it is with great
difficulty it comes out of the shelf again, given the other demands on
donors' attention.'
The UN says that it will continue with its efforts for rehabilitation. Mr
Mousouris says: 'We will not abandon Afghanistan in spite of acts of
violence, in spite of obstacles erected by followers of leaders who have
chosen violence as part of instruments of political antagonism.'
The prospects appear bleak. Western defence experts estimate that the
opposing sides can continue a sustained effort for six to 12 months, even if
no military supplies reach them. Afghanistan is a leading exporter of
narcotics and attempts to introduce crop substitution programmes have little
chance of success under present circumstances.
Despite external attempts to bring about peace, Afghanistan may be set on a
course where tribal warlords call the shots until one side emerges with
clear control.

FT  09 FEB 93 / China signs accounting standards contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international accounting network, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (DTT), has
won a Dollars 2.6m (Pounds 1.7m) contract to develop accounting standards
for China.
The award has been signed with the Chinese Ministry of Finance, and is
designed to bring accounting and auditing practices 'into harmony with
international standards' over the next three years.
DTT consultants will work with a Chinese team to develop general and
industry-specific standards, and to establish a system of continuing
education for the country's 10,000 certified public accountants.
Mr Ted Lee, managing director of the firm in China, said that existing
standards in the country were suitable for a centrally-planned economy with
limited decision-making by individuals or enterprises.
He stressed that the new standards would help provide transparency in
financial information, but would also reflect the unique characteristics of
business in China.
The contract has been funded through a World Bank credit to China, and is
part of the Bank's financial sector technical assistance project.
Ms Heather Skilling, from DTT's office in Washington, said the firm would be
devising a work-plan over the next few months, but expected to develop up to
30 general accounting standards.
She said the aim was to bring them in line as far as possible with the
standards published by the International Accounting Standards Committee.

THE WORLD BANK is expected to lend India more than Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds
2.1bn) in the year beginning April 1993, including concessional assistance
of Dollars 1.3bn from the International Development Association (IDA), the
Indian Finance Ministry said yesterday.
Mr Ernest Stern, the World Bank's managing director, said after an hour-long
meeting with Dr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister, that the bank
would also grant India's request for an annual Dollars 2.5bn in exceptional
financing over the next three years.
Mr Stern, who is in New Delhi for a fortnight, said that India was meeting
the conditions of a World Bank structural adjustment loan.
The World Bank is also providing a Dollars 500m loan to support reforms in
the trade sector. Bank officials said India's tariffs were among the highest
in the world. But a tax reforms committee, headed by noted economist Dr Raja
Chelliah, has already recommended a substantial reduction in the average
tariff rate to 25 per cent by the fiscal year 1997-1998, and a maximum rate
of 50 per cent.
India's aid donors and the Bank's management have also given overwhelming
support to a Dollars 500m loan, approved in December, to provide a social
safety-net programme for former workers in India's unviable public sector
enterprises.
This, said Mr Stern, represented the continued commitment of the
international community to ensuring that the burdens of the transition
process did not adversely affect the poorer sections of society.

Britain will hold back financial aid to Kenya until the International

Algerian leaders have extended indefinitely the state of emergency, imposed
a year ago after suspended elections which the Islamic Salvation Front was
poised to win, writes Francis Ghiles.
The country's five-man presidency, meeting under head of state Mr Ali Kafi,
said at the weekend that it had extended the emergency, in what was
interpreted as a demonstration of its determination to crush Islamic
fundamentalism.

fraud in the management of its Spanish holdings, Mark Nicholson writes from
Cairo.
Three members of the National Assembly, led by Mr Ismail Al-Shatte, chairman
of the parliament's economic and financial committee, will also visit
Madrid. The assembly set up the inquiry into the London-based Kuwait
Investment Office late last year, after the collapse of Grupo Torras, the

Israeli troops shot dead three Palestinians in the West Bank yesterday,
bringing to 10 the number of Palestinians killed in the occupied territories
since last Friday and raising the death toll since Israel's expulsion of 400
alleged Islamic militants to Lebanon in mid-December to 41, Hugh Carnegy
writes from Jerusalem.
Some ministers have expressed alarm at the casualty rates and called for
tougher rules for the use of live fire. But Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime
minister, said the army wanted more, not fewer, tools to combat the
Palestinian uprising. The army yesterday released on bail two reporters for
Reuters news agency in the Gaza Strip arrested on Sunday while filming
unrest.
Meanwhile, Mr Rabin said Israel has 'more than a right' to continue to
receive Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) in annual economic and military grants
from the US despite pressures in Washington for cuts in foreign aid. He
spoke after meeting Senator Patrick Leahy, head of a senate sub-committee on
foreign aid.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Tokyo orders more small business loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of Finance yesterday ordered the country's banks to expand
lending to small and medium businesses, which have been suffering from the
downturn in the economy.
The unprecedented move follows mounting criticism from businesses that
banks, which are trying to reduce their bad loans, are increasingly
reluctant to make loans. Complaints of excessively restrictive lending
policies prompted the ruling Liberal Democratic party to call for lower
lending rates in tandem with last week's cut in the official discount rate.
Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, said the formal request was intended
to maximise the effects of last week's 0.75 percentage point rate cut.
Financial authorities are desperately trying to avert complaints that the
discount rate cut was aimed at shoring up profit margins of the struggling
banking sector.
Mr Yuji Tanahashi, vice-minister of international trade and industry,
yesterday insisted the main purpose of the rate cut was not to improve
earnings at financial institutions. He urged banks to reduce loan rates to
manufacturing companies in order to lead Japan out of the current slump.
Small companies, which are in general dependent on a narrower product range
than larger companies, have been hard hit by falling cash flows in the
current recession. A sharp rise in bankruptcies among smaller businesses,
which are more dependent on bank lending than large companies, added to
worries about a credit crunch.
Leading commercial banks are moving to cut short-term prime lending rates,
or the key rate charged on most creditworthy customers, in response to
falling money market rates following the discount rate reduction. Yesterday,
Sumitomo Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, and Fuji Bank announced a 0.5 percentage
point cut in their short-term prime rates to 4 per cent.
However, businesses claim that banks are increasingly reluctant to apply
lower rates to smaller companies, and are even trimming their lists of
eligible corporations for the more attractive prime rates.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Big stick from Rabin gets in the way of the carrot: Hugh
Carnegy on the battered hopes of an era of conciliation under an Israeli PM
with a vision of peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLE more than six months after Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin took office
proclaiming a vision of at last achieving peace between Israel and its Arab
foes, the self-inflicted crisis over Palestinian expulsions has battered
hopes of his presiding over an era of conciliation.
Instead, many Israeli supporters of Mr Rabin's centre-left coalition fear
that what they regard as his dictatorial style of government has led the
country into an impasse in the Middle East peace talks which will be hard to
resolve.
From the Palestinian point of view, the expulsions and accompanying
violence, such as the seven killings in the occupied territories over the
weekend, have compounded anger over what they say has been a sharp
deterioration in human rights abuses by Israel under Mr Rabin, in particular
in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians express increasing scepticism about carrying
on negotiations for self-rule that have so far yielded no tangible
improvement in their lot.
Last week, complaints about Mr Rabin from the left wing of his own Labour
party burst into the open when Mr Hagai Merom, a Labour MP, attacked him in
the Knesset. Mr Merom said Mr Rabin failed to consult his ministers and then
suppressed criticism, first over the December decision to expel 400 alleged
Islamic militants, and then over a compromise deal with the US to allow 100
to return.
'Recently, Mr Prime Minister, there is fear in the cabinet. It is not good
that there is fear in the cabinet. I don't think a minister who disagrees
should be attacked, especially if he is the justice minister,' Mr Merom
said.
He was referring to Mr David Liba'i, the minister of justice, who was given
just 10 minutes notice of the December deportation orders by Mr Rabin. When
he tried to raise his objections at a subsequent cabinet meeting he was
abruptly overruled by the prime minister.
There is a certain disingenuous quality to this criticism as every minister
except Mr Liba'i, including the cabinet's most noted doves, voted in favour
of the deportations when Mr Rabin informed them of his intentions.
But Mr Rabin's critics say the diplomatic and political mess precipitated by
the expulsions was the consequence of his preference for keeping
decision-making firmly within a small circle of aides in the prime
minister's office and the military establishment. Mr Rabin holds the
powerful defence portfolio as well as the premiership.
An important part of the miscalculation was the assumption that, at least
privately, leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organisation would welcome
tough action against their Islamic fundamentalist rival, Hamas, and would
not stay away from Middle East peace talks in protest. This ignored the deep
Palestinian fear of arbitrary expulsion that transcends narrower
affiliations with political factions.
The mass deportations also hit the Palestinians at a time when resentment
against Mr Rabin's tough security policies was already running high in the
occupied territories. A former army chief of staff, Mr Rabin has long been
an advocate of wielding a big stick in concert with the carrot of peace
talks.
According to figures from Betzelem, an Israeli human rights group,
Palestinian fatalities rose by 20 per cent in the first six months of Mr
Rabin's rule to 76 dead, compared with 63 in the first six months of the
year. The number of children under 15 years of age killed almost trebled to
18. Two-thirds of all deaths did not involve circumstances in which
soldiers' lives were in danger, also a sharp rise over the preceding period.
'I think we have witnessed the worst period since Rabin was defence minister
(up to mid-1990). People are being killed at a very high rate, houses are
now being destroyed by anti-tank missiles and hundreds of people have been
deported,' says Mr Saeb Erekat, a member of the Palestinian delegation to
the peace talks. 'This is having a great impact. People are blaming the
peace process for Rabin's actions - saying the talks give him the cover to
do these things.'
Mr Rabin responds to such criticism with characteristic disdain towards
Israeli doves and Palestinians alike. He insists he has not retreated from
his commitment to make compromises for peace and is anxious for negotiations
to resume. But he has made no secret of his regret that he has not been
able, due to a combination of political rivalries and Knesset mathematics,
to bring right-wing parties into the government to balance the left-liberal
Meretz coalition partner.
'He definitely has mixed feelings about (his coalition), but he is caught in
a situation which he can't change,' says Prof Avraham Diskin, head of the
political science department at Hebrew University. 'Part of his behaviour
towards the doves in the coalition is because of that.'
The question now is whether Mr Rabin can pull his government through the
expulsions crisis and, assuming the peace negotiations can be rebuilt,
retain the domestic political authority required to make the concessions
demanded of Israel.
Prof Diskin thinks he can. 'However you look at it, the government is
weakened. It cannot afford many more errors. But after all Labour is still
the pivotal party. It can still go forward.'

FT  09 FEB 93 / French outburst over UK may be a cry for help: Prime
Minister Beregovoy's attack on British policies was not solely for home
consumption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE outburst against Britain last week by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French
prime minister - triggered by Hoover's decision to close a vacuum cleaner
factory in Dijon and shift production to Scotland - was one of the stiffest
public criticisms ever heaped by one European Community head of government
upon another. But there is more to it than meets the eye.
French officials stressed that while they did not want to spark a diplomatic
row, Mr Beregovoy's statement - that Britain was heading down a dead-end -
was not only heartfelt, but it was a symptom of a general malaise, deeper
than the Hoover problem.
This includes anxiety over Britain's refusal to sign the EC social charter -
designed to reduce differences in labour conditions between community
countries - its delay in ratifying the Maastricht treaty on monetary and
political union, and the competitive advantage accorded to British exports
by the fall in sterling's value after its exit from the European monetary
system. A few days earlier, Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, had
criticised Britain's policies of 'every man for himself'.
In short, Britain looks a decreasingly reliable friend at a time when France
needs all the help it can get to counterbalance growing German power. 'We
need Britain, but it is not always there, especially on many European
issues. This weighs on many other subjects,' said a French foreign office
official. As Mr Beregovoy said a day earlier: 'One must know if Great
Britain wants to be a full part of Europe. . . Great Britain must be placed
in front of its responsibilities.'
The shadow of next month's parliamentary elections, in which the ruling
Socialists are set for a humiliating defeat, helps to explain why the
government is in no mood to make friendly gestures to London.
One of Mr Beregovoy's officials explained that the fight over Hoover was all
part of the government's attempts to defend its European policies in the
face of sceptics in the opposition Gaullist RPR.
The Gaullists based their Maastricht referendum campaign on the theme of how
the EC could harm powerless French citizens. 'I recognise it was a bit quick
tempered. . . but Britain has been taken a bit as a counter-model in an
election campaign in which, to put it very bluntly, social policy on the
left stands against economic liberalism on the right,' the Beregovoy aide
explained.
Just how much relations with Britain have become part of the election
campaign was underlined when Mr Philippe Seguin, the RPR member of
parliament who led the anti-Maastricht campaign, told the newspaper Le Monde
that France and Britain should seek more common positions on European
policy.
But how serious are the other sore points? Mr Beregovoy cares deeply about
the social charter, which he said was essential to getting ordinary people
to support European construction. He even claimed that Mr Major could
increase his parliamentary majority by signing the charter, an idea likely
to cause merriment in Westminster.
He made no reference to the attacks on the franc in his criticism of
Britain, but there is a general suspicion in French government and
opposition circles that there is US and UK political pressure to break the
link between the franc and the D-Mark, defence of which has the status of a
religious crusade among mainstream French politicians. Even the mild Mr
Raymond Barre, a former prime minister, last week denounced 'a political
assault' from 'Anglo-Saxon circles' against the franc/D-Mark parity and the
Franco-German alliance.
Meanwhile, France has just started to feel the effects of sterling's
competitive devaluation. This is unlikely to improve tempers in the
government.
UK exports to France rose 5.3 per cent in the final quarter of last year,
according to the British government.
Yet all this is unlikely to spark a serious diplomatic row. Neither side
wants one, as French and British diplomats in Paris emphasised. Some British
Conservative MPs did react angrily, accusing Mr Beregovoy of electioneering.
If he was indeed electioneering, it fell on deaf ears. The day after, not a
single French national newspaper reported his outburst.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER nearly 14 years as governor of the the Bank of Italy, Mr Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi has reminded the government of Mr Giuliano Amato he is anxious to
step down.
Mr Ciampi, who will be 73 this year, yesterday confirmed weekend reports he
had offered his resignation but had been persuaded to stay on. It remains
unclear how long he is prepared to remain in office.
Rumours of his desire to retire shortly were fuelled by an apparently
unsolicited statement from the prime minister's office thanking him for his
role in defending the lira and giving him Mr Amato's full backing.
When asked yesterday about his offer to resign, Mr Ciampi said: 'If a person
is asked to stay on, it means that the same person has requested to go.'
Last week he was attacked by Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the populist
Lombard League, for being out of touch with events. This attack immediately
provoked expressions of support from all the other political parties.
Yesterday, Mr Ciampi said he had no desire for the succession to the
governorship to become an issue. Yet with the lira floating, the heavily
indebted economy in recession and the political parties in disarray as a
result of corruption scandals, the governor of the Bank of Italy has become
a figure of stability. The bank itself is the sole institution, along with
the state presidency, not to have been tainted by the corruption scandals.
With the bank due to celebrate its 100th anniversary in August, a number of
bankers have seen this as a natural occasion for Mr Ciampi to leave.

FT  09 FEB 93 / France threatens to fine Hoover
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday stepped up the political pressure on Hoover
by threatening to fine the US domestic appliance company for its decision to
switch production from its plant at Dijon in eastern France to Cambuslang in
Scotland.
Ms Martine Aubry, employment minister, said the Labour Inspectorate would
fine Hoover for breaching French employment law. She claimed that the
company, whose closure plans involve the loss of 600 French jobs, had failed
to notify the company's works committee before announcing a plant closure.
'The very least a company should do is to respect the laws of the countries
where it operates,' said Ms Aubry. 'Hoover did not conform with French law.'
She said she also intended to check whether Hoover had broken European
Community legislation, although this is unlikely. Hoover's action has been
condemned by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president who is also Ms
Aubry's father.
However, the Socialist government, acutely aware of its poor record on
employment, is trying to keep the Hoover issue in the spotlight in the
run-up to next month's legislative elections.

BUNDESBANK president Helmut Schlesinger said yesterday that he did not
expect money market rates to react significantly to key interest rate cuts
made by the German central bank last week, AP-DJ reports from Basle.
'The interest rate cuts themselves were part of a process in which we have
been for a long time,' he said. 'The current interest rates in the money
markets will probably, in the short term, be little affected' by the
reductions in the official rates.
Speaking after a meeting of the Bank for International Settlements, Mr
Schlesinger also denied that the Bundesbank acted under domestic or foreign
pressure when it announced its rate cuts.

THE BOSNIAN Serb leader, Dr Radovan Karadzic, came under pressure yesterday
from Russia, Serbia and the Yugoslav federal government, to make concessions
over the proposed map dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces.
As the United Nations Security Council met for its first review of
negotiations on the peace plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen,
both the Russian and Yugoslav governments made clear they fully supported
the plan.
Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton's new US administration, which has
criticised it for allegedly being too favourable to the Bosnian Serbs, was
still working on its own proposals. These are expected later this week and
are thought unlikely to be as radically different as was first thought.
The public support given by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, to
the Vance-Owen plan will complicate the task of the US administration, which
has made clear it wants the Russians to be closely associated with any US
initiative.
Mr Ilija Djukic, the federal Yugoslav foreign minister, issued a special
statement here yesterday saying his government supported the mediators' plan
'as the most complete and realistic framework for establishing just and
lasting peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina'.
Mr Djukic told the FT that he had made clear to Dr Karadzic that 'this is
the time when he should say 'yes''.
However, it is the Bosnian Moslems who are currently deemed the biggest
obstacle to a settlement. Confident the US will not force them to accept an
agreement they oppose, they are refusing to discuss the map altogether.
Mr Vance, in his report to the Security Council, said the mediators had
constantly sought to maintain and reinforce the status of Bosnia-Hercegovina
as a sovereign, independent, integral and multi-ethnic state.
He stressed the map the mediators proposed would require Bosnian Serbs to
give up large areas of territory.
The UN yesterday resumed its humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo amid heavy
fighting in eastern Bosnia and western Croatia.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Bonn prepares a new round of defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, will announce a new round of
defence cuts this week, including reductions in garrison strengths and a
delay in building new barracks in east Germany, as a first step in his
planned defence review.
A reconsideration of contracts for arms and equipment, promised for the end
of March, is likely to be an open-ended process without a firm deadline,
defence officials say. Meanwhile, a freeze on new contracts ordered by Mr
Ruhe last week, will remain in force.
As for a review of manning levels in the Bundeswehr, confirmed by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl at the weekend, it will be completed in the course of the year.
The aim is to see what personnel cuts can be made beyond the current target
of reducing to 370,000 men by 1995, without abolishing conscription. Mr Kohl
yesterday sought to head off rising criticism from defence experts, and from
Nato, about the government's plan to find further urgent savings as part of
its 'solidarity pact' for east Germany. Savings of DM860m (Pounds 358.3m)
this year, and DM700m a year for the next three years, have been ordered.
Mr Kohl said the Bundeswehr and its soldiers 'will receive all the necessary
equipment and support they need to fulfil their new tasks'.
He also promised that all cuts would be carried out in close consultation
with Nato, in order to maintain all Germany's commitments to the alliance.
His reassurance followed criticism from Mr Manfred Worner, the
secretary-general of Nato and former German defence minister, who warned
that planned defence cuts were in danger of undermining the alliance's basic
defence capability. In a weekend television interview, Mr Ruhe also attacked
the extent of the cuts in his budget, saying that defence was having to bear
an unequal share of the burden of savings needed to finance subsidies for
the east German economy.
He announced his defence review last week, while at the same time cancelling
a DM3bn contract with the US for a high-altitude electronic reconnaissance
system known as Lapas.
Defence Ministry officials said that all contracts would be reviewed to see
where savings could be made without suffering penalty clauses. If the cuts
have to be made by the end of March, they fear that the result will be a
haphazard, rather than carefully structured, savings programme.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand indicated yesterday he would choose a
politician who favoured closer European unity as France's new prime minister
after next month's legislative elections.
The president, whose governing Socialist party faces defeat in the
elections, is entitled under French law to choose the next prime minister
providing he or she can command a parliamentary majority. This means he will
almost certainly have to choose a candidate from the conservative RPR and
UDF alliance coalition, which has a clear lead in the opinion polls.
However, President Mitterrand, a staunch supporter of European unity, said
in an interview with Le Monde newspaper that 'it is obvious I will not call
on a prime minister who would be against the construction of Europe', he
said.
The obvious casualty of the presidential veto is Mr Philippe Seguin, the RPR
politician who was one of the most active campaigners against ratifying the
Maastricht treaty in last autumn's referendum. Mr Seguin yesterday announced
his candidature for the premiership.
Front-runners for the premiership with pro-European views include Mr Edouard
Balladur, the finance minister in the previous cohabitation government from
1986 to 1988, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, former French president and now
leader of the UDF, and Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the RPR who was Mr
Mitterrand's choice as premier for the 1986-1988 government.
President Mitterrand, who devoted his considerable political skills to
out-manoeuvring Mr Chirac in the last period of cohabitation, said in the
interview with Le Monde that he would co-operate with a future conservative
administration and would share control of defence and foreign affairs. 'When
one is not made for it, working together requires a modus vivendi,' he said.
Yesterday's declaration from Mr Seguin marked the start of the public
jostling for position among the conservative candidates for the premiership.
Although there are only six weeks before the first round of the elections on
March 21 the campaign has yet to hot up. The RPR and UDF are expected this
week to announce joint proposals for the economy which will include
continuing the Socialists' franc fort policy of preserving a strong
currency.

FT  09 FEB 93 / France threatens to fine Hoover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday stepped up the political pressure on Hoover
by threatening to fine the US domestic appliance company for its decision to
switch production from its plant at Dijon in eastern France to Cambuslang in
Scotland.
Ms Martine Aubry, employment minister, said the Labour Inspectorate would
fine Hoover for breaching French employment law.
She claimed that the company, whose closure plans involve the loss of 600
French jobs, had failed to notify the company's works committee before
announcing a plant closure.
'The very least a company should do is to respect the laws of the countries
where it operates,' said Ms Aubry. 'Hoover did not conform with French law.'
She said she also intended to check whether Hoover had broken European
Community legislation. Hoover's action has been condemned by Mr Jacques
Delors, the Commission president who is also Ms Aubry's father.
But EC officials privately acknowledge that Hoover does not appear to have
infringed EC regulations. Mr Delors himself said as much last week.
However, the Socialist government, acutely aware that rising unemployment is
one of the main reasons for its poor showing in opinion polls in the run-up
to next month's legislative elections, is trying to keep the Hoover issue in
the spotlight.
One of the French government's main weapons against Hoover is new employment
legislation which imposes stringent restrictions on companies planning to
shed labour in France. It compels French employers to produce plans for
alternative jobs for redundant workers and to seek government approval for
redundancies.
The Scottish Trades Union Congress and the French Confederation du Travail
(CGT) issued a joint statement yesterday over the Hoover affair, writes
Robert Taylor, Labour Correspondent. Demanding new rights for workers in
transnational corporations, it called for the creation of European group
committees in each company to enable consultations and collective
discussions before economic decisions were taken.

THE United Nations Security Council was due yesterday to conduct its first
review of the international mediators' efforts to broker a peace settlement
for Bosnia-Hercegovina, but was not expected to take any decisions before
the US comes up with its promised alternative plan, probably later this
week.
The mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance for the UN, and Lord David Owen, representing
the European Community, continued without success their efforts at the
weekend to win the approval of all the warring factions for their proposals
to divide Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. So far, only the Bosnian
Croats have endorsed all three parts of the peace plan and are also the only
ones to have subscribed to the mediators' proposed map.
The Bosnian Moslems, confident that the US would not subscribe to any
solution which would force them to make territorial concessions, declined to
discuss the map during the weekend talks and concentrated on the proposed
ceasefire arrangements.
Over the past few days, however, there have been growing indications that it
will be possible to find common ground between President Bill Clinton and
the mediators, particularly given the strong international support for the
Vance-Owen plan. The UN yesterday resumed its humanitarian airlift to
Sarajevo amid heavy fighting in eastern Bosnia and western Croatia. Fourteen
flights arrived with 131 tonnes of emergency relief, Laura Silber writes
from Zagreb.
They took off from Frankfurt and Split, the Croatian port, after Serb
anti-aircraft fire hit a German relief aircraft bound for Zagreb at the
weekend.
In eastern Bosnia, heavy fighting was reported around Srebrenica, despite a
UN-brokered ceasefire which was supposed to come into force at noon
yesterday.
In Croatia's Dalmatian hinterland, Serb forces claimed to have seized
Pridraga and Novigrad, strategic towns near the vital Maslenica bridge.
Belgrade radio said Serb forces were advancing towards the bridge, which
links Croatia with its Dalmatian coast.

Some 350,000 shares - representing for the most part minority stakes after
the acquisition of majority stakes by employees - were put on offer in
exchange for privatisation vouchers distributed to every citizen. Bids for
shares close in three weeks.
Enterprises in the first of 200 planned offerings in the southern city
include a tractor plant which produced tanks during the Second World War, a
margarine factory, a brewery and an aluminium plant.

<TEXT>
A HIGH-PROFILE public welcome, accompanied by tough talking on nuclear,
economic and non-nuclear security issues, awaits Mr Leonid Kravchuk on a
three-day state visit to Britain as the first president of the newly
independent Ukrainian state.
Speaking in Kiev on the eve of his visit, which starts today, Mr Kravchuk
called on the west to provide greater economic assistance soon or face
dangerous consequences. 'Western aid will determine which path Ukraine and
other former republics choose, whether or not our countries become
democratic,' he said.
But if he repeats recent calls for billions of dollars to finance the
scrapping of nuclear weapons, improve the safety of nuclear plants and
kick-start the ailing Ukrainian economy when he meets Prime Minister John
Major, senior political and business leaders and Mr Jacques Attali, head of
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, he will be told
bluntly that billions are not on offer.
He will also be warned that Ukraine, whose previous government mishandled
the issue of a new Ukrainian currency and made little progress in reforming
inherited communist structures and power networks, will only attract serious
private investment when it starts to tackle macro-economic imbalances. The
point has already been taken by the present government led by Mr Leonid
Kuchma.
The Ukrainian leader will also be urged to ratify the Start 1 strategic arms
reduction agreement treaty as soon as possible.
In Kiev yesterday Mr Kravchuk confirmed that Ukraine remains committed to
becoming a non-nuclear power but insisted that ratification would depend on
financial aid and security guarantees from the nuclear powers. Mr Major and
other senior officials are expected to emphasise the need for Ukraine to
make the best use of what assistance is realistically available from the
west and take a more flexible line with Russia over co-operation in the
destruction of nuclear weapons.
In the past, Ukrainian leaders have tended to play down the importance - and
the likelihood - of substantial western financial aid. But Mr Kravchuk, a
former senior communist official who successfully transformed himself into a
Ukrainian nationalist and won last year's presidential elections with a big
majority, now appears to be counting on a high level of western aid after
last year's sharp economic decline.
The UK visit comes as the Ukrainian government is poised for talks with the
International Monetary Fund about a stabilisation fund.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Military staff for UN urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations should have a permanent military staff as the
requirements for intervention move beyond traditional peacekeeping
operations, according to a report by the Royal United Services Institute,
The London-based defence studies organisation calls for the UN's 'largely
symbolic' Military Staff Committee, comprising the military heads of the
five permanent members of the Security Council, to be regenerated with a
full-time chairman and representatives of all the Security Council
countries.
This body would determine the principles for military intervention and
outline the logistics necessary for sending forces. A control centre would
also be required to provide political and military guidance to commanders in
the field.
In the first issue of a new annual International Security Review, the
institute forecasts increasing pressure on the US, Britain and France to
provide UN forces. The shift in emphasis to peace-enforcement will
increasingly require heavily armed professional soldiers from countries
skilled in high-level command, it says.
It warns that much of this burden may be placed on America's allies since
Washington will be reluctant to commit ground forces where no US national
interest is at stake.
There is strong case for a UN military staff to establish operating
procedures and rules of engagement, it says, especially if eastern European
or other non-Nato countries are to be accommodated into a Nato-style
operation.
However, it rejects as unrealistic the proposal by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali,
the UN secretary-general, for forces to be made permanently available on
standby for the UN.
The report is highly critical of western, and particularly European,
responses to the crisis in former Yugoslavia, saying 'much could have been
done' to avert the disaster in Bosnia. It accuses western governments of now
playing a 'cynical' game, officially rejecting the carve-up of Bosnia while
not intending to take any action that would reverse the territorial gains
made by Serb forces.

THE BANK of France yesterday lowered its 24-hour emergency lending facility
rate by one eighth of a percentage point to 11.5 per cent, writes Alice
Rawsthorn in Paris. It was the third cut in a week and was part of its
attempts to alleviate pressure on the banking system by bringing down French
money market rates,
The French authorities were forced to raise short-term interest rates early
last month to protect the franc. However, the currency's recent stability,
combined with last week's cut in German interest rates, has enabled the
central bank to take a more relaxed stance.

Mr Vassiliou, an independent supported by the still powerful Communist
party, secured 44.2 per cent of the vote on Sunday, against 36.7 per cent
for Mr Glafcos Clerides, veteran leader of the right-wing Democratic Rally
party.
Mr Paschalis Paschalides, backed by the centre-right Diko party and the
small Socialist party, won only 18.6 per cent of the vote.
Mr Vassiliou and Mr Clerides will contest the second ballot next Sunday.
Both men will try to forge alliances with prominent Diko members, but Mr
Vassiliou is already assured of the Socialists' backing.

FT  09 FEB 93 / NatWest cuts 4,000 staff as high street bank job losses rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank is to cut about 4,000 jobs, mostly from its branch
network, taking the number of jobs to be lost in high street banks this year
to at least 10,000.
National Westminster said it expected only a 'minimal' number of compulsory
redundancies this year because cuts would be spread across a wide number of
grades. Last year it dismissed 1,500 staff compulsorily out of a total loss
of 5,500 jobs.
Other banks expecting to shed jobs this year because of new technology,
branch closures and recession include Barclays, which is expecting to lose
3,000 jobs, and Royal Bank of Scotland, which is cutting 3,500 posts by
1995. More banks are expected to make cuts over the course of the year.
Mr Stuart Chandler, NatWest's general manager for human resources, said
changing technology and cost pressures meant job levels would be cut further
in coming years. 'This process will continue for some years ahead,' he said.
The announcement was criticised by unions, which will meet the bank today to
discuss the cuts. However, the NatWest Staff Association, which represents
41,000 NatWest staff, said it welcomed the bank's assurance that there would
be fewer compulsory redundancies.
National Westminster, which employs 95,000 staff, 63,000 in its branch
network, has been attacked by unions for selecting staff for redundancy by
comparing individuals' job performance, disciplinary record and attendance.
About 3,200 jobs are expected to go in the branch network, 600 in the group
services division which handles technology, and 250 jobs in the NatWest
Markets investment bank, of which 150 will be in NatWest Markets' British
operations.
Unions have pressed NatWest to establish a register of people willing to
take voluntary redundancy, but Mr Chandler said the bank would 'use every
means at our disposal to avoid compulsory redundancy short of a voluntary
register'.
Mr Martin Gray, head of branch banking, said there were likely to be few
compulsory redundancies because cuts would affect a larger number of
managers as well as clerical staff, and so there would be more early
retirements.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Pits rescue may hinge on power deal: Government favours
subsidising coal Go-ahead likely for electricity market reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is expected to reject proposals to delay reforms of the
electricity industry as a way of expanding the market for coal in order to
save threatened pits.
Postponing plans for more electricity market competition from next year was
proposed in a cross-party Commons committee report to rescue at least a
dozen of the 31 pits facing closure.
Instead, the government favours an alternative pit rescue plan. This would
involve the two largest electricity generators for England and Wales buying
larger amounts of British-produced coal at subsidised prices even though
there would be no guaranteed market for it.
In return for asking the generators to buy up to 60m tonnes of coal over
five years, the government would offer subsidies of up to Pounds 10 a tonne.
This would bridge the gap between cheaper imported coal and the domestic
product. It could cost up to Pounds 150m in the first year but far less
later.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Tim Eggar, energy
minister, who have been reviewing the controversial pit closure plan, are
keen not to slow the impetus of electricity privatisation.
Although slowing the pace of liberalisation could return to the agenda, a
deal on extra tonnage with the generators is thought likely. The generators
are, however, believed to be balking at the possible amounts.
On top of the 40m tonnes next year and 30m in the subsequent four years
which the generators have already tentatively agreed to buy, the government
is thought to be pressing for them to take an extra 60m tonnes over the five
years. This would save about 10 of the 31 threatened pits, initially at
least.
Talks with the generators are unlikely to produce a deal to provide all the
tonnage needed to persuade MPs to support a government plan. However, a
successful outcome would make a delay in market liberalisation unnecessary.
Under the liberalisation plans, regional electricity companies (Recs) would
be forced to compete from April for the custom of about 50,000 of the
largest customers in England and Wales.
Competition is currently restricted to the 5,000 largest customers in the
country who use 1 megawatt of electricity in any half-hour; under the
liberalisation plans the threshold would be lowered to 100 kilowatts.
Expanding the competitive market would, however, make the Recs less sure
about future markets and this is one reason they have been reluctant to buy
as much coal-fired power as in the past.
Delaying liberalisation would be a way of expanding the coal market and
saving some pits designated for closure.
However, Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity regulator, has advised
the government against adopting this course.
A final decision on liberalisation will not be taken until the government
succeeds or fails to negotiate a deal with the generators to buy extra coal.
The white paper on coal is expected this month, possibly next week.

Sterling fell by nearly 3 pfennigs against the D-Mark in London yesterday
morning as dealers remained concerned about the UK currency's immediate
prospects. After recovering initially from last week's lows, the pound
dropped from around DM2.403 to DM2.375. It later gained some ground to close
at DM2.3825, down more than a pfennig on the day. Against the dollar, it
closed at Dollars 1.4395, down nearly a cent on Friday's close. In New York,
it closed at DM2.3855 and Dollars 1.439. Lex, Page 18; Currencies, Page 27

FT  09 FEB 93 / Spending review to shape early budget decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S sweeping review of public spending will affect expenditure
decisions to be taken as early as this year, Mr Michael Portillo, chief
secretary to the Treasury, announced yesterday.
First results will be available by the summer - when the cabinet will have
to agree spending totals for the following financial year. The public sector
borrowing requirement then is forecast to be running at more than Pounds
50bn a year.
Mr Portillo confirmed that the government would look initially at health,
social security, education and Home Office budgets. He began talks with the
relevant ministers yesterday. But he failed to impress City economists that
borrowing was about to be brought under firmer control.
The focus of the departments' reviews, Mr Portillo said, 'will be on the
medium to longer term, though our aim is that that their provisional
findings should inform the next spending round in the summer'.
Mr Portillo hinted that the National Health Service's Pounds 2.5bn drugs
bill, which was rising at four times the rate of inflation, could be an
early target. All departments will be covered by the review during the
lifetime of the Parliament.
On Channel Four news last night, Mr Portillo said he wanted, over the longer
term, to reduce the number of civil servants. He was looking to spending
levels beyond the end of the century and signalled that tackling the
increased spending burden created by an ageing population was high on his
agenda.
In spite of clear signs from Tory MPs of the political difficulty of a
radical shift from public to private provision, Mr Portillo said no spending
was sacrosanct. 'We will be seeking to identify areas where better targeting
can be achieved or from which the public sector can withdraw altogether,' he
told the Commons.
In the City, Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson, said:
'It is just another question of promises, promises, rather like the
inflation ceiling of 4 per cent.' Previous reviews of public spending had
come to nothing, he said.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist of Greenwell Montagu, said there was
'nothing magical' about announcing a general review of public spending.
The government would have to set out a clear framework for cutting spending
or raising taxes in the March Budget to convince markets it was serious
about cutting public spending, Mr Bootle said.
Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's Treasury spokeswoman, said the review was a
'panic response in reaction to the government's economic mismanagement and
appalling and unacceptable levels of unemployment'.
Conservative MPs warned Mr Portillo against hitting pensioners or ending the
principle of free health care.
The review has already triggered divisions within the party over the future
of contributory benefits - particularly invalidity and unemployment benefit
 -following signals at the weekend from Mr Peter Lilley, social security
secretary, that 'contracting out' of pensions from the state scheme to
private insurance could be extended.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Daf set to shed 1,000 workers in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of the 6,500 jobs at the Dutch and Belgian operations of Daf,
the beleaguered Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker, are to be eliminated,
and it is understood that a first round of more than 1,000 job losses in the
UK will be announced shortly.
Mr Louis Deterink and Mr Friso Meeter, the Dutch-appointed administrators,
said yesterday the jobs in Holland and Belgium would be cut as part of the
main Daf rescue plan currently under discussion with the Dutch government
and Daf's international bank consortium.
The plan calls for the creation of a new limited company, called New Daf, to
salvage the 'core operations' of Daf's Dutch and Belgian medium and heavy
duty truck activities.
New Daf could also absorb some of the UK operations of Leyland Daf, most
probably the light truck assembly plant at Leyland, Lancashire, said Mr John
Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, joint administrative receivers for Leyland
Daf.
The UK receivers warned last night in a letter to the 5,500-strong Leyland
Daf workforce that job losses in the UK were 'inevitable'.
It is understood that Daf had already planned to cut around 1,100 jobs in
the UK as part of its earlier restructuring package, before it was forced to
file for protection against its creditors last week after running up losses
of more than Fl 800m (Pounds 296m) in the last three years.
The UK receivers are also in urgent discussion with Renault, the French
vehicle maker, about the future of its joint venture with Daf to develop a
new range of vans, code-named Excel. There are around 270 Leyland Daf
workers on the Excel project in the UK, mainly in Birmingham.
Leyland DAF shop stewards are to meet Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, today, while union officials are due to have discussions
tomorrow with the receivers on the future of Leyland DAF. Union leaders are
due to travel to Eindhoven on Thursday for talks with the main DAF board in
Holland.
The UK receivers, who will meet more than 200 representatives of the Leyland
Daf UK dealer network today, said last night they believed there was 'a
future for Leyland Daf albeit at a reduced size'.
The Dutch administrators said in a letter to the company's workforce in
continental Europe that discussions about the formation of a new limited
company, with the working name of New Daf, had been under way since last
Wednesday.
The move to transfer the core Dutch and Belgian activities to the new
company had to be completed 'in the next three weeks'. The scale of the jobs
cuts in the Netherlands and in Belgium was much greater than foreseen in the
company's original restructuring plan, said the administrators. 'The
expectation is that in Westerlo in Belgium and Eindhoven in the Netherlands
the total number of jobs will be at least halved.'
Daf has more than 5,000 employees at Eindhoven and around 1,500 at Westerlo.
The administrators said Daf Finance, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Daf
group, would be 'run down and closed'. Leyland Daf Finance, its UK
subsidiary, last week closed its five UK regional offices. They said they
would rationalise and sell off 'as soon as possible' the troubled Daf
Special Products subsidiary in the Netherlands, which manufactures some
military vehicles and aerospace components.

FT  09 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong session for ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICALS and pharmaceut-icals giant ICI saw its shares enjoy their biggest
leap since July last year, confusing critics who argue that the proposed
split-up of the group will entail a very big rights issue. ICI has said it
intends to launch its drugs arm as a separate entity, Zeneca, some time this
year.
The impetus for yesterday's share jump of 46 to 1175p appeared to come
principally from the US. As the company is now in its closed period ahead of
the announcement of results on February 25, the rise could be ascribed to
technical trading rather than fundamental news.
One dealer said US investment bank Goldman Sachs had been telling clients it
had finally offloaded the famous Hanson stake which it took on board last
May. Goldman was unable to comment on the rumour.
There was talk that NatWest Securities, in spite of its negative stance on
the stock, had a big buyer in the US, where investors have been keen buyers
of several blue chips. Chemicals shares had risen sharply in New York on
Friday following recommendations from broker PaineWebber.
Finally, ICI has a strong exposure to the D-Mark, which gained two pfennigs
against sterling yesterday.
Mirror Group falls
The rise and rise of Mirror Group Newspapers was checked yesterday following
a dip in bid rumours and stories in the Sunday press which prompted concern
of a strike by the workforce. The shares fell nearly 6 per cent, against the
market trend, to close 7 lower at 110p.
The fall was also prompted by a statement from Lord Hollick, the managing
director of investment group MAI, that he was not seeking to take over the
newspaper group.
Also, it was reported in the UK weekend press that the Mirror might move its
headquarters and that such a move would be accompanied by heavy job losses,
threatening a workforce confrontation and possibly a strike. However, one
analyst believed that the Mirror had prepared itself for industrial action
by establishing a ghost workforce which would swing into action at short
notice.
Eurotunnel improves
Shares in Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel moved sharply ahead after the
com-pany's broker reiterated its positive stance on the stock and a press
report said the company was about to reach a settlement in its dispute with
tunnel constructor TML. At the day's best the shares were up 15 at 468p,
before coming off the top following an afternoon bout of profit-taking to
close 12 ahead at 468p.
The French press report indicated that a settlement of the tunnel's cost
overrun dispute was 'within reach', but sources close to the company later
denied there had been any such breakthrough in the talks.
SG Warburg, Eurotunnel's broker, repeated its buy stance on the stock in an
internal note on Friday which came to the market's attention yesterday.
Turnover in the UK was healthy and the shares were heavily traded in Paris.
There was further whispering around Kingfisher, which last week admitted it
was in talks with Darty, the leading French electrical retailer. Fears over
a Pounds 1bn-plus rights issue had weakened the shares, but sentiment
improved yesterday, with some in the market suggesting that Kingfisher was
more likely to take on more debt, so that only around Pounds 300m might be
raised by way of rights.
However, Kleinwort Benson yesterday issued a buy note on the stock, arguing
that if the deal goes ahead Kingfisher will get Darty, which the broker
believes undervalued, cheaply. It also says that if agreement is not reached
the shares will look cheap on the back of the rights issue fears. The stock
added 4 at 531p.
Bid favourite Alexon had a roller coaster ride as a variety of stories were
heard. Weekend press speculation that executive heads would roll were spiced
further by market talk that the clothes group was still in play and that a
bid may still be forthcoming. The shares dropped 8 at the opening, jumped 16
by noon and weakened at the close to finish 5 ahead at 82p.
There was very little pressure on British Gas shares ahead of the Ofgas
report today, the stock closing unaltered at 290p. There was, however,
renewed buying of BP from the US, where there were suggestions that Salomon
Brothers had turned to be a strong buyer of the stock. BP shares managed a
minor gain at 267 1/2 p, ahead of the fourth-quarter numbers scheduled for
Thursday.
The sale by Enterprise Oil of its interests in the Hudson, Hutton and North
West Hutton oil fields in the North Sea to C Itoh, of Japan, for Dollars
106m in cash came as no surprise to the market but was nevertheless greeted
with a 4 rise in Enterprise shares to 465p.
Not surprisingly, Clifford Foods attracted buyer attention and climbed 8 to
513p following Friday's disclosure that it had received an approach.
Northern Foods, a possible predator, saw large turnover of 4.7m as the
shares put on 4 to 266p. Another candidate, Unigate, rose 2 to 327p. Warburg
was also said to be recommending the stock.
Food retailers were dull, VAT worries continuing to cloud the sector.
Goldman Sachs recommended a switch out of Tesco, off 6 1/2 at 243 1/2 p, and
into Argyll Group, steady at 374p. Tesco was also depressed by a reported
downgrade and overvalued stance from Hoare Govett.
The spectre of heavy rights issues continued to dog the banking and
insurance areas of the market. Both sectors have recently come under
pressure, having previously substantially outperformed the market.
Lloyds, which begins the banks' preliminary reporting season this Friday,
lost 3 more to 534p on 2.8m traded. Many analysts, however, expect Lloyds to
register the biggest dividend increase of all the high street banks - a rise
of 10 per cent to around 18.5p is viewed as the minimum the City expects -
and profits are seen rising to as much as Pounds 800m, compared with Pounds
645m last time.
The cash-call stories continued to impact heavily on National Westminster,
which slipped 6 to 442p after announcing another 4,000 job losses.
Some banks managed to register modest improvements but rises were achieved
more by the closing of large short positions than any great weight of
buying. The technical argument was borne out by the exceptionally low levels
of activity in the sector.
Barclays, due to report on March 4, picked up 5 to 434p and HSBC put on 5 at
574p. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBoS) settled a penny harder at 236p following
confirmation that the bank had disposed of a 90 per cent stake in its
merchant bank, Charterhouse, for Pounds 235m. Worries about the price RBoS
received were not translated into selling pressure in the market, dealers
said.
Lloyds Abbey Life, expected to report marginally lower preliminary figures
tomorrow, edged up 6 to 450p.
Goldman Sachs reiterated its switch recommendation out of Ladbroke Group, 3
ahead at 206p, and into Rank Organ- isation, 5 firmer at 718p.
Queens Moat Houses remained friendless, dipping 3 to 49p in big turnover of
10m.
Speculation that Trafalgar House would soon be making a rights issue
intensified and the shares gave up 4 to 87p. A bullish statement from the
chairman at Avon Rubber's agm sent shares in the tyre and rubber goods
manufacturer climbing 15 to 553p.
James Wilkes appreciated 9 to 53p on bid speculation. Selling continued in
British Steel and the shares eased 1 1/2 to 77p on volume of 7.4m.

FT  09 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains trimmed in slow trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS left to Glaxo and ICI, two of the more heavily weighted stocks in the
London market, to keep the equity sector firm at the close of a lacklustre
session yesterday. Expectations of another cut in domestic interest rates at
Budget time also helped, and optimistic views on UK retail trading benefited
from news of a stronger rise in December's consumer credit than expected.
In early deals, the FT-SE 100 Index gained 18.2 points, largely in response
to Wall Street's record close ahead of the weekend. Trading volume was
disappointing in London, however, and it was a firm opening in stock index
futures which provided the impetus for the equity market. Initial weakness
in sterling failed to dent base rate hopes but encouraged demand for shares
in Britain's export companies.
There was little heart behind London's advance, and share prices came off
the top when Wall Street made a sluggish start to the new session, shedding
5.41 Dow points in UK trading hours.
By the close, the gain on the FT-SE 100 had been cut to 7.1 for a final
reading on the day of 2,870. The peak of 2,900, traded briefly in the wake
of last week's unexpected reduction in rates by the Bundesbank, appears a
solid barrier, at least until interest rates fall again or there is more
convincing evidence that the domestic economy has steadied. Yesterday
brought news of further job cuts by National Westminster Bank and gloom
deepened over prospects for the UK operations of Daf, the truck manufacturer
struggling with financial collapse.
US buying of pharmaceutical issues provided one of the firmer spots in the
London market. The rise in Glaxo shares made up 3.5 points of the day's rise
in the Footsie, with ICI's gain on currency factors providing a further 2
points. Investors continued to buy the construction stocks, which have been
perceived as the backbone of the interest rate-sensitive sector. Properties,
too, held on to their recent advance. There were further gains among the
utility shares, where dividends are seen as attractive.
Among the weaker features, food retailers continued to shy away from
strengthening fears that the sector may be targeted for increased VAT in the
Budget, due in March. Banks, now on the eve of their corporate reporting
season, held steady, although the sector is prominent in the list of rights
issue predictions.
Trading volume proved disappointingly modest, with the US houses active at
first but failing to follow through when Wall Street opened. The day's Seaq
total of 545.8m shares compared with 694.6m on Friday, when retail business
lived up to its recent buoyancy to record a value total of Pounds 1.47bn.
Non-Footsie volume jumped sharply yesterday, comprising nearly 70 per cent
of the day's business. In the early part of the session, the FT-SE Mid 250
Index, which tracks the impact of second line stocks, moved up smartly. But
profit-taking in the smaller stocks increased significantly and by the close
the Mid 250 Index was a mere 0.9 up on the day at 3,051.4.
The FT-SE Mid 250 outperformed in January, rising by 3.2 per cent, compared
with the fall of 1.4 per cent in the FT-SE 100 Index. According to the Stock
Exchange, turnover in domestic equities increased by 9.8 per cent on the
month and by 17.8 per cent on the year.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS IN stock index futures reported a dull but volatile session, with
little in the way of features or economic data on which to focus, writes
Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 got under way at 2,872, just
below Friday's close. It soon went into retreat on selling from a leading UK
house and independent traders, falling to the day's low of 2,866 within the
first half-hour of business.
The downward trend was reversed by buying from another UK house, and March
then continued to move forward to reach the day's high of 2,895 at around
2pm. The poor opening on Wall Street once again led to a decline in the
contract and it closed at 2,874, up 3 from its previous close and at a
four-point premium to the cash market. The premium had moved between 16 and
nil during the session. Turnover was poor, reaching only 6,198 lots.
The volume in the traded options indicated a more active sector. It reached
30,165 by the close, with the FT-SE 100 option trading 7,037 contracts and
the Euro FT-SE 100 option 1,954.
In the stock options, British Steel was the most active with a day's total
of 3,900 lots. It was followed by BP at 2,542, with the April 300 calls the
busiest series. Trafalgar House was also active as talk of a rights issue
continued to circulate, and some 1,580 contracts had been dealt by the
close.

production boost Oils

Wall Street
US EQUITIES were narrowly mixed yesterday as the market took a breather
after last week's record-breaking performance, writes Karen Zagor in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 4.60 down at 3,437.54, after gaining
more than 8 points in the late afternoon. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased
1.08 to 447.85, while the Nasdaq composite lost 2.54 to 698.44. Trading
volume on the New York SE amounted to 243.4m shares, and declining issues
outnumbered rises by 944 to 939.
The Dow, which rose 25.40 to a record 3,442.14 on Friday, added more than
132 points last week. In spite of the market's slight decline yesterday, the
sell-off that some investors had feared would follow last week's stellar
performance did not materialise.
Oil shares benefited from speculation that Opec will agree to cut production
when it meets at the weekend.
An analyst at Salomon Brothers increased his investment ratings on British
Petroleum, Chevron, Mobil and Texaco to reflect anticipated price
improvements as well as bottom-line improvements following cost-cutting
measures taken last year. BP was Dollars  3/4 higher at Dollars 47 5/8 ,
Chevron up Dollars 1 to a 52-week peak of Dollars 76, Mobil ahead Dollars
7/8 at Dollars 65 7/8 and Texaco Dollars 1 firmer at Dollars 62 3/4 .
Auto company issues continued to see heavy NYSE trading, with General Motors
rising Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 38 7/8 and Chrysler off Dollars 1/2 to
Dollars 40 3/8 .
Among other active stocks, Merck was up Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38 1/2 ,
International Business Machines rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 52 7/8 and
Philip Morris eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 74 1/2 .
Supermarket group Kroger gained Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 17 3/4 on the back
of fourth-quarter operating income of 74 cents a share, up from 46 cents the
previous year.
Morrison Knudsen, the construction and engineering company, climbed Dollars
1 3/8 to Dollars 22. On Friday it posted fourth-quarter net income of 23
cents a share, against 19 cents a year earlier.
Wheeling-Pittsburgh hit a 52-week high of Dollars 9 1/2 , up Dollars 2.
Although the steel company last week turned in a fourth-quarter and annual
deficit and predicted a first-quarter loss, investors were encouraged by
predictions that the company expects to show a profit in subsequent
quarters.
In the Nasdaq market, declines in big stocks in the technology sector drove
the composite index lower. Intel slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 106 1/8 ,
Apple Computer receded Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 56 1/2 and Microsoft dropped
Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 85 3/4 .
Biotechnology shares also took a battering. Biogen tumbled Dollars 4 5/8 to
Dollars 32 1/8 after Prudential Securities cut its rating on the stock from
'buy' to 'hold'. Amgen weakened Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 49 3/4 .
Canada
THE TORONTO market continued its early-February rally, moving higher in
heavy trading as the transportation sector led the way.
The TSE 300 index ended 16.92 ahead at 3,394.83 and advancing issues
outpaced declines by 346 to 297 after volume of 49.5m shares valued at
CDollars 455.8m.
The market has gained almost 90 points so far this month on large volume,
showing signs of a solid rebound after suffering a stagnant January. Eleven
of the 14 stock groups gained ground yesterday, with the transportation
index up 3.3 per cent, forest products ahead 1.7 per cent, conglomerates 1.2
per cent higher and consumer products gaining 1.1 per cent.
American Barrick declared a two-for-one stock split and boosted its dividend
by about 23 per cent, but it closed CDollars  1/4 down at CDollars 39 1/2 .

FT  09 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong gains ground
as Tokyo throttles back
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average lost ground on small-lot profit-taking, while overall
activity remained low due to the lack of fresh news, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average was finally down 51.17 at 17,281.73 after moving
between 17,393.20 and 17,247.82. Selling by investment trusts outpaced
buying by public fund managers in the afternoon.
Volume fell to 200m shares from 322m. However, rises still led declines at
the close by 492 to 457, with 188 issues unchanged, while the Topix index of
all first section stocks gained a slight 1.12 at 1,309.59. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 0.26 to 1,058.98.
In spite of the fall in some shares, traders said sentiment remained firm
due to last week's Wall Street rise and cuts in Japanese and German interest
rates. Some leading commercial banks announced a reduction in short-term
lending rates, encouraging hopes of a boost in money supply.
Semiconductor-related issues were bought on hopes of a recovery in the US
market. Advantest, a semiconductor testing device maker, rose Y180 to Y2,550
and Tokyo Seimitsu, a semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker, climbed
Y35 to Y905. NGK Spark Plug, a ceramic package maker, put on Y5 at Y955.
Recent reports that Tonen, an oil refiner affiliated with Exxon and Mobil
Oil, was under pressure to raise dividends after claims from the US oil
companies, pushed up General Sekiyu (47 per cent owned by Exxon) by Y11 to
Y976. Tokyo Electric Power gained Y20 at Y2,580. Traders said some investors
found the company's 1.9 per cent dividend yield attractive.
Isuzu Motors, the day's most active issue, dipped Y6 to Y381 on
profit-taking by dealers who had bought the stock on the restructuring
theme. Oki Electric, also seen as a beneficiary of corporate restructuring,
eased Y1 to Y410.
Sasebo Heavy Industries, also bought by dealers on hopes of higher sales due
to proposed requirements of double hulls for tankers, receded Y13 to Y510 on
profit-taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 11.45 to 18,661.53 in volume of 28.1m
shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's clothing discounter, strengthened Y130 to
Y8,300 on brisk sales in spite of a recent fall in consumer spending.
Roundup
WALL Street's record close on Friday supported the region.
HONG KONG recovered from early losses and the Hang Seng index finished a net
39.44 ahead at 5,786.65 after touching 5,706.61. Turnover was low at
HKDollars 1.43bn.
HSBC Holdings was the most active stock of the day in turnover of HKDollars
121m but ended steady at HKDollars 61.

National Australia Bank advanced 9 cents to ADollars 7.74 and Commonwealth
Bank was 3 cents higher at ADollars 6.07. Elsewhere, BHP appreciated 16
cents to ADollars 13.84.
MANILA registered its biggest one-day rise since the beginning of the year,

UOB Foreign fell 35 cents to SDollars 8.80 and SIA Foreign declined 20 cents
to SDollars 9.40.
TAIWAN saw some profit-taking after last week's gains but the weighted index

KUALA LUMPUR weakened slightly as Tenaga lost 20 cents to MDollars 9.25 and
Telekom dipped 10 cents to MDollars 13.20. The composite index ended 3.23
off at 641.60 in turnover of MDollars 348m.

1,569.95. Fletcher Challenge improved 5 cents to NZDollars 2.45 and Telecom

SEOUL saw late institutional buying in Kepco, up Won500 at Won186,000, help
to lift the composite index 0.76 to 672.18 in an otherwise uneventful day.
Turnover was Won381.2bn, against Saturday's Won319.8bn.
BOMBAY was strong on the first day of the new account and the BSE index rose
63.26 to 2,712.15. BANGKOK closed off the day's high on late profit-taking
but gains in some large-capitalisation issues helped the SET index up 0.88
to 980.93 in turnover of Bt8.1bn.

FT  09 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent opens the week on a
quieter note
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES had a quieter day after last week's excitements, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT overturned early losses to close at a new six-month high, but
weakness in banks and carmakers kept its gains within bounds.
The DAX index ended 5.79 higher at 1,647.16. Turnover was reported to be low
compared with Friday's DM9.9bn.
Siemens stood out with a gain of DM10.50 to DM635.20, its highest close
since mid-July. Last week Robert Fleming reiterated its buy recommendation
for the electricals major, with qualifications about the speed and extent of
measures which it is taking to improve its competitiveness.
Volkswagen dropped by DM2.80 to DM291.70 as analysts said that there is bad
news to come. In banks, following last week's gains on interest rate
sensitivity, Bayernhypo and Bayernverein each shed DM2.70, to DM415.30 and
DM432.70 respectively.
The day's biggest mover was Lufthansa, up DM4.50 or 3.7 per cent to DM113.50
on newspaper reports of talks with Europe's largest tour operator, Touristik
Union International, over combining the two companies' air tour operations.
PARIS concentrated on Eurotunnel after reports in the local press that a
settlement in its dispute with the contractor, TransManche Link, was
imminent. The shares improved by FFr1.20 to FFr38.85 in heavy volume of 3.5m
shares. The CAC-40 index, however, lost 3.45 to 1,904.73, off the day's high
of 1,915.41.
Cap Gemini Sogeti was another big riser, gaining FFr10.30 or 6.5 per cent to
FFr169.50 in spite of France Telecom denying reports that it was negotiating
to take a stake in the computer services group.
Axa slipped by FFr43, or 3.6 per cent to FFr1,142 on speculation that it
might announce a rights issue today.
MILAN opened strongly but some corporate blackspots trimmed the market's
advance later in the day, and the Comit index finished 4.91 higher at
509.12.
Foreigners remained active buyers, particularly of telecommunications stocks
after Friday's confirmation that the government planned to reorganise the
sector.
Sip added L51 to close at L1,715 before trading up to L1,728 after hours and
Stet rose L75 to L2,345. Montedison gained L16 to L1,257 on continued buying
sparked by last week's news of negotiations with Sweden's Kabi.
Italmobiliare and its Italcementi subsidiary were both marked down after
worse than expected results late on Friday from the former's French unit,
Ciments Francais, and weekend newspaper reports that another Pesenti group
company had been mentioned in investigations into bribes paid to political
parties.
Italmobiliare closed L345 higher at L38,320 but sank to L36,500 after hours
and Italcementi fell L270 to L8,893.
AMSTERDAM was strong in the major blue chips with Royal Dutch gaining Fl
2.40 to Fl 156.10 and Akzo Fl 1.60 higher at Fl 143.00. The CBS Tendency
index put on 0.3 to 98.0.
There was no respite for KLM and Fokker although Dasa indicated that it
still hoped to complete a deal with the latter on taking a 51 per cent
stake: the shares slipped Fl 1.30 and 20 cents respectively to Fl 26.70 and
Fl 10.40.
Disappointing provisional 1992 results from paper and packaging groups KNP,
Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG, which announced late last year that they were to
merge, had varying effects on the shares: KNO lost 40 cents to Fl 29.60,
Buhrmann-Tetterode shed 70 cents to Fl 29.40 while VRG gained 60 cents to Fl
23.60.
ZURICH ended a quiet day slightly firmer. The SMI index closed 3.6 higher at
2,137.2.
Among industrials, bearers in cement producer Holderbank, the most active
stock, rose SFr6 to SFr594 following recent recommendations by brokers.
Oerlikon-Buhrle bearers jumped SFr39 to SFr490. Last week the Swiss
government said 60 training aircraft ordered by South Africa from Oerlikon's
Pilatus subsidiary were not regarded as arms, and were therefore not subject
to an export embargo.
ISTANBUL resumed its upward trend and the 75-share index advanced 191.33 or
4.1 per cent to 4,863.15 after profit-taking on Friday left the market 3 per
cent weaker.
ATHENS continued its impressive upward surge with the general index adding
32.56 to 833.63, a 24 per cent rise since the start of the year.
Analysts point to lower inflation and the prospect of cuts in domestic
interest rates as underpinning the market, which will also benefit from the
expected strong performance of the agriculture and tourism sectors this
year.

FT  09 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: France benefits from German rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's unexpected decision on Thursday to cut interest rates
encouraged strong performances by some of the European bourses last week.
The FT-Actuaries World Index rose by 2.1 per cent in local currency terms,
with Europe 3.5 per cent ahead.
The strength of the dollar provided the second element to the story,
trimming some advances in US currency terms and leaving others showing
declines on the week.
The Bundesbank's decision to cut its discount and Lombard rates came after a
week in which all the indications were that no such move was planned.
Analysts speculate that the decision was taken during the 24 hours before
the announcement was made, with the problems experienced by the weak Danish
krone providing the final incentive for the German move.
Mr Sushil Wadhwani, director of UK and European equity strategy at Goldman
Sachs, says the expected date for a cut in German rates had been March 18.
He saw the Bundesbank's move as the first instalment of a reduction and
believes that the markets might well have to wait until the middle of next
month for the next piece of the action.
Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
also cautions against expectations that the German move heralds more cuts in
the immediate future.
France was the principal beneficiary of the German initiative. Its equity
market advanced by 7 per cent in local currency terms on the week as
pressure for a devaluation of the franc eased and hopes rose that the way
might now be open for lower French rates. In dollar terms, the rise was
trimmed to 4.1 per cent.
German shares, with financials particularly strong, climbed 4.8 per cent and
Italy, also benefiting from the Bank of Italy's decision to lower its
discount rate by  1/2 percentage point - before Germany acted - rose by more
than the European average.
There were lower than average gains among the more defensive markets: in
Switzerland, with its interest rates already low, and in the Netherlands,
which still managed to rise above the corporate traumas suffered at Daf and
Fokker during the week.
Ireland was the latest country to demonstrate devaluation arithmetic. It
gained 6.6 per cent in local currency terms in the wake of its devaluation
of the punt; but in dollar terms, it emerged with a 3.9 per cent decline.
The US was 2.3 per cent higher as Wall Street, firm for much of the week,
marched into record territory on Thursday and Friday. Japan, itself the
beneficiary of a 75 basis points reduction in its discount rate, was the
laggard among the big battalions as analysts agreed that government inspired
buying by public funds, designed to stabilise the Tokyo market, was no basis
for an extended equity revival.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Tough morning for sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
STERLING fell by more than 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark in half-an-hour of
London trading yesterday, as dealers remained concerned about the UK
currency's immediate prospects, writes James Blitz.
The pound hovered at DM2.41 at 8am in London yesterday, having bounced back
from an historic low against the D-Mark last week after the Bundesbank's
interest rate cut on Thursday.
But between 9am and 9.45am London time, the currency dropped from around
DM2.4030 to DM2.3800. It stabilised for a while, before suffering another
fall from DM2.3840 to a low for the day of DM2.3750 between 11.30am and
midday.
The pound subsequently rallied to finish in London at DM2.3825, down more
than a pfennig on the day. Against the dollar, it ended at Dollars 1.4395,
off  3/4 cent, and later closed in New York at Dollars 1.4390.
Mr Mark Brett, an economist at BZW in London. was concerned by the speed and
scale of the morning's fall. 'It is very unusual to see a currency go down
like that,' he said. 'People have shorted the pound, and you would expect
dealers to buy back the currency as it falls, giving it a bit of a boost.
All in all, it is very destabilising.'
Several dealers suggested that the currency had fallen victim to two very
large sell orders, although there were also reports of very heavy selling of
the currency in general.
One London dealer said his bank had executed what were regarded as two large
buy orders for the pound. But he had been astonished at the tiny impact of
these counter-flows on the price action.
Another dealer believed the pound would probably creep back up to DM2.40 in
the next few days because of signs yesterday afternoon that large
institutions were demanding the currency once more. 'The pound could fall to
DM2.20 or DM2.30 in the next few months,' he said. 'But the fall should be
gradual because all the bad news has been factored in by the market.'
There was a growing feeling in London that the problems of the European
exchange rate mechanism were far from over, in spite of Thursday's easing by
the Bundesbank.
The French authorities cut the overnight rate for lending francs by 1/8
percentage point, but the franc simply lost ground on the move, bottoming
out at a bid rate of FFr3.3880 to the D-Mark and ending in London at
FFr3.3810. It closed at the bottom of the ERM grid, with a divergence of -35
per cent from its central Ecu rate.
The Danish krone, which rebounded dramatically against the D-Mark following
the cut in German rates, closed yesterday at around DKr3.8075 to the D-Mark,
comfortably within its ERM bands.
But problems linger for the Danish authorities. Three-month krone were
quoted yesterday at 17 per cent. Some dealers also believe a large
proportion of the recent outflow of krone is yet to be repatriated.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Buoyancy is fading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE buoyancy that followed last week's cut in the Bundesbank's officially
posted rates showed signs of fading yesterday, in spite of another cut in
the rate at which the Bank of France lends money overnight to commercial
banks, writes James Blitz.
Last week's 25 basis points reduction in the Bundesbank's discount rate to
8.00 per cent encouraged France to ease monetary policy yesterday without
adversely affecting the French franc.
At the start of trading, the French authorities announced that they would be
offering overnight money at 11 1/2 per cent, against 11 5/8 per cent on
Friday. However, the move was not received enthusiastically by the markets.
After lunchtime in London, the franc gradually fell back beyond the
FFr3.3850 level against the D-Mark, having opened near to FFr3.38.
Three-month French franc interest rates, which were bid at around 11.10 per
cent after the overnight rate move, also appreciated, creeping up to 11.31
per cent towards the close of French trading. The March French franc
contract finished at 89.14, down 10 basis points on the day.
The bearishness in the French market was partly due to evidence that
conditions in the German market were not getting any easier. German call
money yesterday hovered unchanged on Friday's levels, at around 8.60 per
cent.
The Bundesbank's repo allocation rates should ease at tomorrow's tender. One
London based dealer was looking for a cut of about 10 basis points. But any
downward move in call money rates will be checked if, as some dealers
expect, the Bundesbank drains liquidity from the market on Wednesday.
As the March Euromark contract moves towards maturity in a little over one
month's time, it becomes highly sensitive to events in the cash market.
Yesterday, it retreated 10 basis points on the day to 92.05. But it is still
discounting a further 40 basis points off three-month money in the next four
weeks.
However, the underlying tone was downbeat. One London based money dealer
said: 'The Bundesbank's move last week may have underlined the current level
of money market rates, rather than re-establishing new ones.'
The overnight rate for cash in the sterling money market peaked at 11 per
cent yesterday after dealers failed to remove a Pounds 1.25bn in normal
operations.
There was late assistance of Pounds 755m and three-month money closed
unchanged on the day at 6 1/8 per cent.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gas chief vows to repel
boarders - Deborah Hargreaves on a growing trend against foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN gas industry is not going to make the same mistake as the oil
industry and sign over its resources to foreign companies, according to Mr
Rem Vyakhirev chairman of the Russian state gas production company, Gazprom.
Mr Vyakhirev's voice carries much political clout in Russia as he presides
over one of the country's most important sources of hard currency and one of
Russia's few - perhaps its only - success stories. He also has the ear of Mr
Viktor Chernomyrdin, ex-Gazprom chairman who is now prime minister and was
once deputy to Mr Vyakhirev at an oil refinery in Siberia.
His resistance to foreign involvement in joint venture gas production and
transportation marks another blow to many western oil and gas companies,
which have seen their ambitions in Russia increasingly frustrated.
Mr Vyakhirev, who left the oil industry because of its rush to involve
foreign investors, believes a lack of strategic thinking has left the
industry without the wherewithal to solve its own problems. Russia could be
forced to import oil in two to three years.
Gazprom, on the other hand, has managed to maintain gas production in spite
of a chronic lack of capital. Russia has 40 per cent of the world's gas
reserves, much of which is in shallow, uncomplicated geological formations
that can be developed fairly easily.
Mr Vyakhirev admits that Gazprom may approach foreign companies for
specific, small-scale investment projects, but he would rather see domestic
gas prices raised more quickly in line with inflation to provide investment
funds. The country recently raised gas prices by 200 per cent but this still
leaves them way below world prices at Rbs600 (70p) per 1,000 cubic metres.
'These prices will be in place for five months and I'd like to see prices
increased automatically. If not, all these additional rises will be worth a
glass of vodka by the end of the year,' Mr Vyakhirev says. Inflation in
Russia was running at a rate of 2,200 per cent last year.
Gazprom's production chiefs agree: 'Gas prices are ridiculous; they don't
even cover our costs of production', says Mr Reim Suleimanov, director
general of Urengoi Gazprom in western Siberia. 'We can't invest with prices
at this low level - we can barely survive.' Mr Suleimanov runs the world's
biggest gas field, in Urengoi, which last year produced 280bn cubic metres
of gas. Much of this is sent to western Europe via pipeline across the
Ukraine.
But he is painfully aware of the need to invest in new satellite fields in
order to keep production steady. Otherwise it will begin to drop off from
1997. Mr Suleimanov wants to develop neighbouring fields in the giant
Urengoi cluster such as Pitsovoye, Yen Yakha, North Urengoi and eventually
Zapolyarnoye.
He realises that these fields must be developed now in order to come on
stream in four years' time, when output is falling from the main Urengoi
deposit. But Mr Suleimanov does not have the funds to put into investment
and Gazprom's headquarters in Moscow have so far come up with little cash.
A feasibility study on the north Urengoi field has estimated development
costs of between Dollars 200m and Dollars 350m. The total cost of bringing
all the satellite fields into production would be more than Dollars 1bn.
Mr Vyakhirev estimates that Gazprom as a whole requires Dollars 8bn to
Dollars 9bn for its development plans over the next five years. The company
has secured about a third of its needs in foreign bank credits and is in
discussions with more banks.
There is an alternative for Mr Suleimanov: he can sell gas condensate and
oil on the world market for hard currency - these are produced as
by-products from his gas field. Gazprom centrally receives about Dollars 4bn
from these sales - half of which is allocated to the government partly to
pay off debts since Gazprom was set up as a joint stock company last
November.
But Mr Suleimanov is not allowed to keep most of his hard currency receipts
and he believes his investment funds will be slow in coming: 'It is my
personal point of view that without foreign involvement, those fields will
not be developed,' he says.
The problem for Mr Suleimanov and other heads of production at Gazprom is
that Moscow wants to retain a tight rein on their activities. 'The unified
gas system was not invented; it was designed like an aircraft and it
operates like a single organism,' Mr Vyakhirev says.
In spite of Gazprom's transformation into a joint stock company with sales
of shares planned to employees, Moscow is not offering much local autonomy.
'What is this freedom everyone is crying about? - it's like a disposable
napkin. Liberty is a notion to be used for clever people, but for simple
people it's just a waste,' Mr Vyakhirev believes.
Urengoi Gazprom has been working to a limited extent with Bechtel Energy
Resources on specialised drilling technology that will enable the company to
reach deeper layers within its gas fields. So far, Bechtel has drilled two
test wells at a cost of Dollars 2m each, but the company is minimising its
spending until it receives a clearer message about foreign investment.
Mr Alexander Margulov, director general of Yamburggasdobycha - Gazprom's
production association on the giant Yamburg field 200 km (125 miles) inside
the arctic circle points to certain areas for foreign investment. 'We are
badly lagging behind in ecological care, completion of wells, and hi-tech
equipment.'
Production in Yamburg is still increasing - at a level of 178bn cubic metres
a year and rising to 205bn cu m by 1995. This level can be maintained for 10
to 15 years. The role Mr Vyakhirev foresees for foreign companies is as
providers of equipment and technology that is not available in Russia. 'We
don't need extensive scientific assistance, but we've certainly identified
certain problems that can be helped from outside,' he says
Gazprom needs large diameter pipes, horizontal drilling technology, welding
equipment and insulation. In addition, the company is inviting tenders from
international construction companies to build a Dollars 550m PVC plant at
Urengoi which would be run on local gas.
'We want to be as self-sufficient as possible: we're not planning any
large-scale involvement of foreign companies,' says Mr Vladimir Rezunenko, a
Gazprom board director. But Mr Rezunenko goes on to point out that even
Gazprom's smaller projects such as that for the production of 5.5m tonnes of
oil from the Yamburg field are large by world standards.
Indeed, the tide appears to be turning in Russia against foreign involvement
in joint venture gas production projects. Many foreign companies are now
targeting Kazakhstan and other independent republics that are opening up to
outside investment.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar market lacks volatility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE last nine months the sugar market has experienced the lowest
monthly average price volatility since 1974, according to the latest sugar
report from ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house.
The nearby New York raw sugar futures contract has been stuck in a range
between 8 and 10 cents a lb.
Man suggests that three seasons of production surpluses have reduced
speculative interest in the sugar market, while the rapid demise of central
buying agencies has eliminated significant participation by final buyers on
the terminal markets.
'The disparate nature of the emerging buyers in East and Central Europe is
leaving the speculators uninformed and the trade, in many instances,
reacting in a piecemeal fashion as cargoes are sold and funds are
organised,' says the report.
Man has reduced its estimate for the 1992-93 production surplus from 3.4m
tonnes to 1.5m tonnes, with production at 114.91m tonnes compared with an
earlier forecast of 116.95m tonnes and consumption at 113.45m tonnes - only
just below the earlier prediction.
FO Licht, the German statistician, recently cut its 1992-93 production
forecast from 116.19m tonnes to 113.94m tonnes.
Demand for vegetable oils will remain buoyant, but prices are unlikely to
benefit for the next two years, according to a report from the Economist
Intelligence Unit. Although stocks will decline, lower stock to consumption
ratios will be tolerated because of more efficient management.
The EIU expects is basket of vegetable oil prices (half soyabean, half palm
oil) to reach Dollars 721 a tonne in 1996-97, up from Dollars 410 a tonne in
1991-92 and Dollars 391 in 1992-93. The outlook is more bullish for
oilmeals, which will follow a similar pattern, dipping from Dollars 209 to
Dollars 197 a tonne in 1992-93 before rising to Dollars 265 a tonne in
1996-97.

The government of Brazil's Bahia state has promised Dollars 1.5m to help
fight a disease that is threatening to halve the state's cocoa crop, the
Brazil Cocoa Trade Commission (Comcauba) said, reports Reuter from Rio de
Janeiro.
The money will be given to Fundecau, a fund set up by producers and
exporters in Bahia to combat witch's broom disease, which producers say has
affected at least 70 per cent of the Bahia growing region. They estimate
that output could be slashed by 50 per cent in three years if nothing is
done.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian oil shake-up raises
foreign hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of Russia's state oil company is being sacked in a move that may
herald yet another shake-up in the organisation and possibly a more open
regime for foreign energy companies seeking to invest in the Russian oil
sector.
The decision to dismiss Mr Lev Churilov, a former Soviet minister for oil
and gas, from his post as head of Rosneftegaz was taken by Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister and former Russian energy minister, at the
end of last month while Mr Churilov was a business trip to Tokyo.
Mr Churilov's office confirmed the sacking yesterday and said he had been
appointed Russian trade representative to Nigeria, an important oil
producer.
His post as head of the state concern is being taken by Mr Ilya Leshenets,
his former deputy. The sacking of Mr Churilov, an advocate of state
development of the oil sector with as little as possible reliance on foreign
investment, is seen as an encouraging sign for the major oil companies now
seeking deals in the oil sector.
Mr Chernomyrdin, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,
last month, explicitly singled out the energy sector as the area in which he
most wanted foreign investment.
However, the sacking is also seen as part of the struggle round the creation
of a new state company - called Rosneft - that will take over some of the
functions of Rosneftegaz. Rosneft was created last year by a decree of Mr
Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to take over the management of the
government shares in the oil companies which were to be privatised.
No agreement has yet been reached on the closing down of Rosneftegaz and the
assumption of its responsibilities by Rosneft. According to one senior oil
ministry official yesterday, the history of Rosneftegaz has been one of
guerrilla warfare between its management and the energy ministry over the
definition of powers and responsibilities.
One foreign analyst said that 'Churilov's sacking got him out of the way
before they work out who will be the new leaders of the oil industry'.
The leadership of Rosneft is at present in the hands of Mr Oleg Alekperov,
formerly the head of Lukoil, one of the new state production companies.
Lukoil itself, with the other state oil companies Yukos and Surgutneftegaz,
will be outside the jurisdiction of Rosneft, thus further weakening its
effectiveness.
At the same time, privatisation of the oil industry, the key area as far as
foreign investors are concerned, has gone slowly - and according to a report
by the Interfax news agency yesterday, may have been stopped altogether.
Interfax reported that Mr Pyotr Mostovoi, head of the State Property
Management Committee, has sent telegrams to his regional branches telling
them to cease to accept privatisation proposals from the oil corporations.
It quoted Rosneftegaz officials as saying that the presidential decree
ordering privatisation proposals to be ready by December 31 was
'unrealistic'.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Time running short for coffee
pact renegotiation - Lack of political will on the part of consumers is
frustrating producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRODUCING countries plan to meet in Mexico at the end of this month
to try to salvage something from the latest round of negotiations on a new
international pact.
Brazil, the world's biggest producer, obliquely blamed the US, the biggest
consumer, for the deadlock at the end of last week's talks at the
International Coffee Organisation's London headquarters. It issued a
statement accusing 'some important consumer countries' of 'no longer showing
the political will to reach an understanding' and thus 'threatening to
undermine the very basis of negotiation'.
The statement - from Mr Rubens Barbosa, head of the delegation - expressed
'disappointment and frustration at the lack of progress in what was to be
the decisive phase in the negotiation of a new international coffee
agreement. This sense of frustration is shared by millions of people in
Latin America, Africa and Asia who are dependent on coffee exports for their
livelihood and see in the agreement an important factor in stabilising the
market'.
The US is now likely to come under intense lobbying pressure from coffee
producing countries, who are estimated to have lost about Dollars 10bn in
revenues since July 1989, when the ICO's export quota system collapsed.
Arabica coffee prices in New York fell from around 120 cents a lb to below
50 cents a lb in September last year - the lowest level for more than 20
years.
Some coffee producers believed that Mr Myles Frechette, the head of the US
delegation, was operating with his hands tied because of the change-over in
the US between the Bush to the Clinton administrations. But Mr Frechette
strongly denied that he lacked a mandate to negotiate. 'I've had a mandate
from the beginning,' he said last week. 'No new mandate is needed.'
Both sides have already agreed that any new agreement should be based on a
universal quota system. This would cover all coffee exported, regardless of
destination, so avoiding the development of a second, cheaper, market in
coffee exports to consumers not party to the agreement. The so-called second
tier-market was one of the main reasons for the breakdown of the quota
system.
However, last week's talks foundered on the twin rocks of 'selectivity' and
'automaticity'.
Selectivity is the term used for dividing the coffee market into different
areas ranging from robusta coffees, mainly grown in Africa and used for
soluble coffee, and the top quality arabicas, grown in Latin America and
favoured by Western consumers. The system would allow consumers to buy the
coffee they wanted; under the previous system quota increases applied to
both robustas and arabicas. However, producers proposed four types - a
proposal which Mr Frechette said had convinced the US 'more than ever that
three is the way to go'.
Automaticity would involve the rolling over of individual countries' export
quotas at the end of each year, depending on the previous year's export
performance. Producers argued that it was unlikely such a complex system
could be set up perfectly from year one, and proposed a review after one
year of operation. But the US argued that it was not beyond the wit of
delegates to design a system that worked.
The ICO's self-imposed goal of concluding negotiations by March 31 now looks
almost impossible to reach. Delegates return on March 22 for a further week
of talks when they will have to agree not only on automaticity and
selectivity, but also on the size of the universal quota, its distribution,
and the price ranges to be defended. If they manage all that and sign a new
agreement, it could just about be ratified by the end of September when the
current, purely administrative agreement ends.

NICKEL extended earlier gains in afternoon trading on the LME to end near
the highest level for four weeks. The move was largely underpinned by
technical factors once early commission house and option buying lifted
three-month prices above Dollars 6,000 a tonne. The market hit a high of
Dollars 6,119 before profit-taking set in, but final kerb business of
Dollars 6,100 was still around Dollars 165 up from Friday. Some dealers said
Western European scrap was in short supply. Background support for COPPER
came from news that workers at Poland's KGHM said they were ready to strike,
but both union and management said a stoppage was unlikely soon. GOLD was
set at Dollars 327.95 a troy ounce on the London bullion market in the
afternoon after an earlier fix at Dollars 327.60, just above its lowest fix
for seven years at Dollars 327.45 in January. Professionals tried to push
the price through support at Dollars 327 earlier to trigger sell-stops
thought to be around that level, but physical offtake provided support.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cold comfort for Siberia's big
earners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ZIMFIR Yabukov, a 32-year-old engineer, has moved from his home town in
the Urals to monitor a gas gathering station in the Yamburg field in western
Siberia, where he earns eight times more than he would at home.
Mr Yabukov has had to leave his wife and two children at home, 2,000 km
away, much to his wife's distress, but he says the salary is so good he will
do the job for at least three more years. He is employed by Gazprom, the
Russian state gas production company at its Yamburg field inside the arctic
circle.
The Yamburg settlement where he lives for two weeks before returning on a
free flight for two weeks' home leave, has the wild-west feel of a pioneer
town. No children under 18 years are allowed at the settlement and few
workers bring their wives.
Gazprom must pay high salaries and entice its employees with a range of
subsidised consumer goods in order to get engineers to work in the harsh
conditions where temperatures can fall as low as minus 60 degrees centigrade
(-76 F). Yamburg means 'end of the earth' in the language of the local
Nenets people.
Mr Yabukov's salary has increased sharply in recent years as Gazprom must
review payments monthly while inflation in Russia is rampant. His room and
board in a employee apartment block are free.
Novy Urengoi, also in western Siberia but south of Yamburg, is a full-scale
town set up by Gazprom 15 years' ago. Here, salaries are five times those in
the rest of the country. Company officials say it was difficult to get
people to work in Siberia, but it is getting easier as other companies make
engineers redundant.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Spanish issues rally strongly on hopes of
rate reduction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
SPANISH government bonds rallied strongly with foreign investors buying on
hopes that the Bank of Spain will lower interest rates later this week.
Dealers believe the Bank of Spain may cut the intervention rate, currently
at 13.25 per cent, by about 25 basis points at Friday's repo.
The Bundesbank's decision to cut its official interest rates last Thursday
helped to ease tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism and has
paved the way for lower interest rates elsewhere in Europe, dealers said.
The yield on the Spanish benchmark bond due 2002 fell from Friday's close of
11.30 per cent to 11.22 per cent, while the futures contract rallied half a
point.
Dealers noted that activity in the main European government bond markets was
rather muted in the absence of important economic data or statements from
the Bundesbank.
In the German market the Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 93.22,
traded in a range of 93.12-93.29 and ended the day at around 93.17 as
investors took profits or switched into Spanish and Danish government paper.
UK government bonds closed slightly weaker in thin trading with the Liffe
gilt futures contract slipping from 101.17 to 101.15 on volume of only about
9,000 contracts. Sterling weakness contributed to the weak tone of the gilt
market, dealers said.
The market appeared to ignore news of the Treasury's review of government
spending. Mr Michael Portillo, treasury chief secretary, told parliament the
results of a public spending review could emerge by mid-1993.
AUSTRALIAN government bond prices fell on concern about the federal
election, the government's planned financial package, and the weakness of
the Australian dollar.
Prime minister Mr Paul Keating has set March 13 as the date for the national
election and he is expected to unveil plans aimed at increasing employment
in today's economic package. Mr Keating's announcement on Sunday took the
markets by surprise, as the poll date was earlier than had been expected.
The Australian dollar weakened against the US currency, from 67.70 US cents
on Friday to 67.10 yesterday. In the bond market, yields rose on fears that
today's financial package would contain measures likely to lead to increased
government spending.
Short-dated bonds were the worst hit, with the yield on the 13 per cent bond
due July 1996 rising from 7.69 per cent to 7.82 per cent, while the yield on
the 10-year issue, the 9 1/2 per cent bond due August 2003, increased from
8.74 per cent to 8.82 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied as money market rates fell and some of the
commercial banks lowered their short-term prime rate by half a point.
The moves reflected last week's cut in the Official Discount Rate, but
prices ended little changed on the day.
The March futures contract ended firmer on the day, rising from its opening
level of 109.65 to a high of 109.84 before ending at 109.70. Dealers expect
the June futures contract to take over as the benchmark shortly.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 moved in a range of 4.275 to 4.30 per
cent, ending the day unchanged at 4.295 per cent.
Rates on three-month certificates of deposit dropped to a new historic low
of 3.20 per cent, while the unsecured overnight call rate slipped 1/32 point
to 3 3/32 per cent.
LONGER-dated US Treasury prices moved lower yesterday afternoon but trading
was fairly subdued through most of the day before this week's important
refunding auctions.
The Treasury will sell Dollars 15.5bn in three-year notes today, Dollars
10.75bn in 10-year notes on Wednesday and Dollars 9.25bn in 30-year bonds on
Thursday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  15/32 lower at
105 3/16 , yielding 7.193 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was off  3/32 to yield 4.150 per cent.
The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange three-day matched
sales when Fed funds were trading at 2 15/16 per cent, below their perceived
target of 3 per cent.

<TEXT>
NAFINSA, the Mexican government-owned development bank, is preparing to
launch an unusual Eurobond issue with warrants into Grupo Televisa, the
Mexican media giant.
The Dollars 100m issue of five-year bonds, arranged by Bankers Trust, is
accompanied by an issue of three-year warrants, which can be exercised into
Televisa American depository shares in the third year.
The deal offers investors the first long-dated warrants on an individual
stock in the Mexican market.
The issue is expected to carry a six per cent coupon, and has been largely
pre-placed with emerging market funds and traditional warrant buyers. The
deal is expected to be launched officially today.
The warrants, which can be traded separately, are likely to be priced at a
premium of 20 per cent to the current stock price.
The commercial paper and medium-term note ratings of Kingfisher, the UK
retailer, have been put under review for a possible downgrade by Standard &amp;
Poor's, the US rating agency, as a result of the company's planned links
with Darty, the French group. S&amp;P said it will be meeting Kingfisher's
management soon.

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Amsterdam SE issues takeover
barriers warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AMSTERDAM Stock Exchange yesterday issued a warning to 20 listed
companies that they must comply with modified rules, agreed last year, which
limit the total allowable number of barriers to hostile takeover.
The bourse posted notices to a number of companies, including Hoogovens, the
steelmaker, and Nutricia, the biochemicals concern, warning that they must
limit their anti-takeover barriers to a total of two. The limitation, agreed
last year, was aimed at opening up what remains one of the most
tightly-defended systems of corporate ownership in Europe, but many
companies have yet to comply.
The stock exchange has given laggards until February 15 to comply with the
regulations or face possible but unspecified sanctions.
The warning came as the exchange unveiled a plan aimed at shoring-up its
competitive position against London's electronic SEAQ exchange, which has
siphoned-off a substantial share of business in recent years.
A newly-announced two-tier trading system involves a split of the market
into separate institutional and retail segments.
Trading in the 30-odd leading international issues will be conducted on a
computer-based wholesale system on which offered 'buy' and 'sell' prices are
displayed; institutions and brokers will moreover be given access to an
additional system upon which they will be able to deal directly with each
other.
Remnants of the present trading system will be preserved for the retail side
of the market; intermediary dealers, known in Holland as hoekmen, set prices
and match buy and sell orders from their smaller and less powerful clients.
The plan follows two years of study by a panel set up specifically to
formulate ways of defending Amsterdam's long-term existence as a financial
centre. Its recommendations are similar to measures adopted recently by the
New York Stock Exchange.
Full details, together with new proposals to revise the bourse's cost
structure and fees, will be placed before the bourse membership for approval
next month.

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Finland reopens Ecu
Eurobond sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Finland reopened the neglected Ecu-denominated sector
yesterday with a Ecu500m five-year Eurobond, the first sovereign issue since
last June when the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty put the
international Ecu market out of favour with investors.
The last sovereign borrower in Ecu Eurobonds was the Kingdom of Spain, which
raised Ecu250m via a two-year note last May. In July, the European
Investment Bank brought a 10-year Ecu200m Eurobond. Since then, the sector
has been virtually moribund, apart from some small issues of Ecu80m or less.
The French Treasury's successful auction of Ecu710m worth of 10-year notes
in late January had raised hopes that the Ecu market would soon recover.
Syndicate managers said that a resurgence of investor interest in
Ecu-denominated instruments had also encouraged borrowers to look again at
this area.
Yesterday's offering from Finland was priced at 99.40 to yield 8.15 per
cent, in the middle of the indicated range of 8.13 to 8.18 per cent. An
official at the lead manager Morgan Stanley International said that about
two-thirds of the issue had been placed by yesterday afternoon and the
syndicate was unlikely to be broken until today, to allow time to place the
remaining stock in the Far East overnight.
Yesterday's offering was Finland's second in the international market so far
this year. In late January, it reopened its Dollars 2bn global bond offering
launched last November, adding a further Dollars 1bn of five-year bonds.
Finland has a borrowing programme of close to FM60bn in 1993, which will be
split between the international and domestic markets.
Finland's foray into the Ecu market reinforced rumours that the French
Treasury was looking to raise up to Ecu2bn in five-year notes. Other issuers
said to be showing interest in Ecu were Belgium, the European Investment
Bank and the European Community. Dealers reported that prices in the Ecu
secondary market eased in the afternoon, in anticipation of a sharp increase
in supply.
Finland kicked off this week's round of sovereign borrowing, which is
expected to be quite heavy. Scandinavian issuers were said to be interested
in the dollar sector, and among non-sovereign borrowers, the Asian
Development Bank was reportedly looking at raising dollars in the 10-year
area.
In the early afternoon, the Republic of Ireland launched a Dollars 500m
Eurobond due 2003, priced at 99.46 to yield 6.95 per cent. An official at
the co-lead manager, Daiwa Europe, said the issue was Ireland's first
Eurobond this year, and its first in the Eurodollar sector since February
1990.
He reported good sales into Germany, the Benelux countries and the UK, and
said that a majority of the issue had been placed by late afternoon. The
remainder is expected to be placed in the Far East. After the syndicate
broke, the deal traded at 99.43 bid, representing a widening of two basis
points in the yield spread since the launch to 57 basis points over
comparable US Treasuries.
Elsewhere, France Telecom raised FFr2.5bn through a 10-year Eurobond, priced
at 98.70 to yield 8.07 per cent. Syndicate managers reported good demand, as
investors were encouraged by the improved outlook for the French franc since
the cut in German rates. The issue traded at 98.40 to yield 8.11 per cent,
reflecting the weaker tone in French government bonds.

THE strategic battle between Australia's biggest retailer, Coles Myer, and
the country's largest wholesale grocery supplier, Davids Holdings, has
flared up again, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
Coles Myer yesterday announced it had paid ADollars 18.2m (USDollars 12.3m)
for a 14.9 per cent interest in Queensland-based QIW Retailers.
Davids has a takeover offer in force for QIW, but the offer has been bogged
down by legal action alleging breaches of the Trade Practices Act.
Last year, Davids unsuccessfully sought an injunction to prevent Coles Myer
from buying QIW shares.

NEWS CORP, Mr Rupert Murdoch's Australia-based international media company,
has announced a 27 per cent increase in after-tax operating profit to
ADollars 452.8m (USDollars 305.9m) in the fiscal first-half to end-December,
compared with ADollars 355.3m in the same period a year ago, AP-DJ reports
from Sydney. Earnings per share fell to ADollars 1.09 compared with ADollars
1.10.
News Corp said 'gains in operating profit were reported by almost all of the
company's businesses.' It said Fox Broadcasting and Fox Television Stations
in the US reported 'significant gains' compared with a year earlier.
'In addition, inserts, magazines and newspapers worldwide all posted
particularly strong results in weak advertising environments. These gains
were partially offset by lower earnings from Twentieth Century Fox Film and
HarperCollins.'
News Corp said the dividend would be increased 20 per cent to 1.5 cents.
Profit before accounting for abnormal or unusual items rose 94 per cent to
ADollars 490.1m from ADollars 252.2m. Sales rose 1 per cent to ADollars
5.33bn against ADollars 5.27bn.

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: American Barrick to lift
dividend
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO, MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, has shrugged off the
lacklustre prospects for the yellow metal by raising its dividend and
announcing a two-for-one share split.
The semi-annual dividend is being increased to 4 US cents a share after the
share split, compared with 6.5 cents prior to the split. The share split
will take place by means of a special stock dividend, with each holder of a
common share on February 19 receiving another share on March 1.
Barrick defied the prevailing gloom in the gold industry last week by
announcing an 89 per cent jump in 1992 earnings, thanks largely to rising
production from its flagship Goldstrike mine in Nevada.
An active hedging programme has protected its earnings from the sliding gold
price.
Barrick's entire output until the end of 1994 is locked in at an average
price of more than USDollars 400 an ounce, compared with the current price
of USDollars 328.
Canadian Tires has reported that heavy price discounting, especially in the
fourth quarter, brought a 43 per cent drop in 1992 net profits, though
turnover rose by 8 per cent, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Other negative factors for the national hardware, sports goods and car parts
retailer, Canada's biggest franchise business, included losses on petrol
retailing and a CDollars 15m loss at its new US subsidiary.
Net profits for 1992 totalled CDollars 72.3m or 87 cents a share against
CDollars 127.1m or CDollars 1.41m a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars
3.2bn against CDollars 2.9bn.
Fourth-quarter profits equalled 3 cents a share, down from 29 cents a year
earlier.
Mitel, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker formerly controlled
by British Telecom, earned a small third-quarter profit but lost CDollars
9.3m or 15 cents a share on turnover of CDollars 305m for the first nine
months, writes Robert Gibbens. A year earlier the nine-month loss was
CDollars 10.7m on revenues of CDollars 285m. US sales improved and a lower
Canadian dollar is helping.
Dominion Textile, Canada's integrated textile group, plans to invest
CDollars 20m (USDollars 15.8m) including working capital in its Swift
Textiles denim manufacturing unit in Columbus, Georgia, Reuter reports from
Montreal.
The capital expenditure includes the addition of new looms and equipment
modifications, the company said.

THE Philippine government plans to auction part of its stake in Philippine
Airlines (PAL) to try to resolve an ownership battle and raise money for
economic programmes, Reuter reports from Manila.
Philippine National Bank (PNB) has been directed to sell a 20 per cent stake
held by state institutions in PR Holdings, a consortium that owns the
majority of PAL. The move is seen as helping to resolve the stalemate
between PAL chairman Mr Antonio Cojuangco and his allies, and Mr Lucio Tan,
who heads a beer and tobacco empire. Each side owns about 40 per cent of PR
Holdings, with government institutions holding the balance.
Together with PNB, the Development Bank of the Philippines and a military
pension fund own 20 per cent of the consortium that bought 67 per cent of
PAL when it was privatised last year. The remaining 33 per cent is held by
the government.

THE sale of hotels and companies planned under Egypt's most serious move
towards privatisation is likely to raise at least Dollars 150m, according to
a consultant, Reuter reports from Cairo.
Egypt has recently named four five-star hotels, other tourist facilities and
some consumer product companies for what would be its biggest sale yet of
state-owned assets.
'The companies for sale are worth not less than Dollars 150m,' Mr Ahmed
Shawki, a consultant involved in the deals, said.
Economists expect most companies to be auctioned off rather than publicly
floated on Cairo's stock market.
The for-sale list includes the Shepherd and Sheraton hotels in Cairo, the
Hilton hotel in Luxor, the Oberoi in Aswan, luxury Nile pleasure boats and
tourist village projects. No date has yet been fixed for the sales.

AOYAMA TRADING, the Japanese discount clothing retailer with chain stores in
mainly suburban areas, plans to launch seven retail outlets in Taiwan, Hong
Kong and China this year, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
It will establish a wholly-owned subsidiary to set up four retail stores in
Taiwan and hopes eventually to increase the number of outlets to about 60.
The company's plan also calls for one retail store in Hong Kong, one in
Shanghai and another in Shenzhen.

WHARF Communications, part of the Wharf (Holdings) group, is to take a stake

Wharf will take 40 per cent of the consortium with the remaining 60 per cent
split equally between Wharf chairman, Mr Peter Woo, and MKI Corp. The
consortium will then buy 50 per cent of Sichuan Allday TV Development, which
will initially invest Yn33m (Dollars 5.5m) in the project. The remaining 50
per cent will be held by China-owned Sichuan Province Cable TV Enterprise

departs
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMALGAMATED Banks of South Africa (ABSA), South Africa's largest bank,
yesterday suffered a severe setback with the announcement that the services
of one of its most senior executives, Mr Bob Aldworth, had been 'terminated
with immediate effect'.
A terse announcement from ABSA said 'this action is the result of
investigations into certain irregularities within the ABSA group'. Mr
Aldworth has also been stripped of his ABSA group directorships.
Industry analysts were unable last night to explain Mr Aldworth's fate. He
had only recently been appointed the executive director, marketing, for the
corporate banking division, making him one of the four most senior
executives in the group.
The loss is a double blow to ABSA as his banking skills were not only rare
in a group where many senior executives have a building society background,
but he had the important task of increasing ABSA's share of the corporate
market which badly lags its overall market share.
Following the recent retirement of another senior ABSA executive, Mr Piet
Liebenberg, Mr Aldworth's departure will fuel speculation as to whether ABSA
now has the managerial acumen to complete the ambitious rationalisation
programme set in train following a series of mergers in 1991 and 1992.
This is not the first occasion that Mr Aldworth has been forced to step down
from a senior executive position. In 1982, when managing director of the
then Barclays Bank operation in South Africa (now First National Bank), Mr
Aldworth resigned following allegations about his private life.
ABSA's last published results - for the six months ended September 1992 -
showed a 14 per cent advance in net profits to R293.8m (Dollars 94.2m).

THE strategic battle between Australia's biggest retailer, Coles Myer, and
the country's largest wholesale grocery supplier, Davids Holdings, has
flared up in public again.
Coles Myer yesterday announced it had paid ADollars 18.2m (USDollars 12.3m)
for a 14.9 per cent interest in Queensland-based QIW Retailers.
Davids has a takeover offer in force for QIW, but the offer has been bogged
down by legal action alleging breaches of the Trade Practices Act.
Last year, Davids unsuccessfully sought an injunction to prevent Coles Myer
from buying QIW shares.
Mr Peter Bartels, chief executive officer of Coles Myer, said last night
that the QIW purchase was a strategic investment that would allow Coles to
expand into the wholesale grocery market.
'The independent wholesale grocery market has become increasingly important
and it has been obvious for some time that there would be major
rationalisation in that segment,' he said.
Coles would seek appropriate representation on the QIW board but had 'no
present intention' of purchasing further shares, Mr Bartels added.

PACIFIC Magazines &amp; Printing, the magazine associate of the Australian-based
media group News Corporation, reported a 17 per cent increase in profit to
ADollars 31.4m (USDollars 21.2m) for the six months ended December.
Sales rose 11 per cent rise, to ADollars 334m.
The company, which was floated in October 1991, paid two dividends totalling
20.4 cents for the half-year.
Mr Ken Cowley, chairman, said the result was helped by a ADollars 76m
reduction in debt to ADollars 225m.
This allowed the group's interest expense to fall from ADollars 14.2m to
ADollars 9.2m. Tax provision rose from ADollars 11.0m to ADollars 13.6m.
Mr Cowley said the result comprised modest trading profit increases in both
the commercial printing and magazine divisions.
He said the magazine division was being reorganised in order to allow
further staff reductions.
Hongkong Bank of Australia, part of the Hongkong and Shanghai banking group,
has reported its first annual profit in four years.
The bank made an after-tax profit of ADollars 8.06m in 1992, compared with a
loss of ADollars 37.8m the year before.
In spite of the turnround, the bank had to make provisions.

flash-memory link

<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Electric, the Japanese electrical and electronics group, and
SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor joint venture, are negotiating
a possible tie-up in the development and manufacture of flash-memory chips,
Mitsubishi said.
The talks between Mitsubishi and SGS highlight the Franco-Italian group's
eagerness to move into the market at an early stage by securing a partner in
a stronger financial position than SGS and with proven competence in flash
technology.
Flash-memory chips, which retain information even when the power is switched
off, are expected eventually to replace disk drives and other magnetic
recording devices in portable electronic products.
The market for flash memories is estimated to grow to an annual value of
Dollars 1.5bn by 1995, according to Dataquest, the high-technology
consultancy.
The discussions between Mitsubishi and SGS are in line with the growing
industry trend to share the financial burden of research and development in
new technologies.
Intel, the US semiconductor manufacturer, and Sharp have already announced
joint development of flash technology. Toshiba, the inventor of flash, and
IBM are also joining forces to develop the technology, while Fujitsu and AMD
have agreed jointly to build a factory to manufacture flash-memory devices.
Mitsubishi has independently developed technology in flash-memory chips of
up to 16 megabits.
Although a tie-up with SGS would enable the company to share development
costs, Mitsubishi would have no difficulty continuing its development
efforts on its own, a Mitsubishi official said.
If joint development and manufacture were agreed, the connection would also
provide Mitsubishi with a route into the European market, the official
added.
Joining forces with Mitsubishi would provide SGS with much-needed funding
and would give it a route into the Japanese market, expected to be a major
source of demand for flash-memory chips.

THE NETHERLANDS' top three paper and packaging groups - KNP,
Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG - yesterday released figures indicating a steep
fall in profits for 1992.
The three companies, which last year announced plans to merge into the
second biggest paper group in Europe, after Stora of Sweden, warned of a
continued deterioration in market conditions during the first half of the
current year.
KNP, the biggest of the three, said its profit before extraordinary items
fell to Fl 79.4m (Dollars 42.6m) in 1992, down Fl 280m, on turnover of Fl
4.7bn. Including extraordinary gains and losses, the comparable figures are
Fl 295m for 1991, against Fl 56.7m.
Buhrmann-Tetterode saw a slight rise in turnover from Fl 5.58bn to Fl 6.3bn,
but earnings halved from Fl 193m to Fl 85m. Net profits, including
extraordinary results, fell from Fl 103m to Fl 50m.
At VRG, profits tumbled from Fl 53m to Fl 21.5m, in spite of a sales advance
of 13 per cent to Fl 3.5bn. Detailed figures are to be released by all three
companies in early April.
'These are not good results,' conceded a KNP spokesman, 'but if you look at
the condition of the market and the losses being turned in by our
competitors, especially in Sweden, we are glad to have made a profit.'
Difficult market conditions will persist in the first half. 'Despite current
adverse recessionary influences,' however, the merged company expects it
'can not only maintain, but also improve its competitive position.'
Nevertheless, rationalising the operations of all three groups will
'initially involve costs,' the statement added.
Under the terms of the planned merger, Buhrmann shareholders are being
offered one share in the new company, to be named KNP BT, for every share
they own. VRG shareholders will receive 0.8 shares for each existing share.
The combined group hopes to be better placed to compete in the increasingly
consolidated European marketplace. The merger terms are to be put to
shareholders for approval at a series of meetings scheduled later this
month. The merger offer expires on March 5.

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Castor trustee considers legal
action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE bankruptcy trustee of Castor Holdings, the Montreal-based property
finance group backed largely by European investors, is considering further
legal action against Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg, the German-Canadian financier,
and others involved in Castor's collapse.
An official of Richter and Associates, the trustee, said yesterday that
investigations were continuing into the 'massive discrepancy' between
Castor's assets and its liabilities. A decision on further action is
expected in the next month or so.
Richter began proceedings last December to recover CDollars 24m (USDollars
18.8m) which Mr Stolzenberg allegedly appropriated from Castor for his
personal gain.
Richter won a court order to seize Mr Stolzenberg's personal assets in
Canada, including a house and three penthouses in Montreal and two luxury
cars. The trustee has also sued Castor's other directors, alleging they
approved a dividend payout when the company was insolvent.
Castor, which specialised in high-risk second and third mortgages and
construction loans, went into bankruptcy last July. Although the value of
its assets was set at CDollars 1.9bn in 1991, creditors are likely to lose
at least CDollars 1bn.
Mr Stolzenberg has filed a motion seeking to overturn last December's court
order on the grounds that the trustee failed to reveal all the facts of the
case. Mr Neil Stein, a Montreal lawyer who represents Castor, added
yesterday that 'most of the facts are denied'.
Mr Stein said Castor's other directors would also contest the trustee's
claims.
Mr Stolzenberg last December sold a controlling interest in Imry Merchant
Developers, the UK property group, as part of a restructuring of Imry's debt
by Barclays Bank. Castor's creditors have sought to establish a link between
the Montreal company and Imry.
Mr Stein said the only link was the use of a Castor offshore subsidiary in
an earlier Imry refinancing 'for technical, tax treaty reasons'.
The funds channelled through the subsidiary were guaranteed by a term
deposit for the same amount. Mr Stein said that 'not one cent of Castor's
money' was used.

<TEXT>
SAFEWAY, the California-based supermarket group, yesterday unveiled plans to
cut its corporate administrative staff, contributing to a charge against
fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 13.8m, or 12 cents a share.
The charge will also cover the cost of consolidating Safeway's distribution
centre in Sacramento into a new centre in Tracy, California. Safeway, which
employs about 1,000 people in corporate administration, did not say how many
might lose their jobs.
The company's overall earnings for 1992 were depressed by tough competition
in the US food retail industry.
In the 1992 fourth quarter, Safeway earned Dollars 22.2m, or 19 cents a
share, against a net loss of Dollars 47.7m, or 48 cents, a year earlier.
Sales rose to Dollars 4.85bn from Dollars 4.66bn.
For the whole of 1992, Safeway earned Dollars 43.5m, or 37 cents compared
with profits of Dollars 54.9m, or 48 cents in 1991. Sales totalled Dollars
15.15bn against Dollars 15.12bn in 1991.
Stripping out one-time items, Safeway said its underlying annual earnings
rose to Dollars 98.4m, or 83 cents, from Dollars 79m, or 69 cents.

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: SEC suit threatens NY Post deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of the New York Post appears to be once more in the balance
following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission has sued the
tabloid's prospective new publisher, Mr Steven Hoffenberg.
The SEC suit, against Mr Hoffenberg and his Towers Financial factoring and
accounts receivable business, alleges Towers misled investors about its
financial health. It also charges that Towers fraudulently sold Dollars 215m
of unregistered securities to over 2,800 investors.
Mr Hoffenberg, who signed a contract to buy the paper this weekend, expects
final approval of ownership by February 19, but there was speculation
yesterday that the SEC move could block Mr Hoffenberg's plans to buy the
Post.
The SEC motion, which will be heard on February 24, seeks to freeze Mr
Hoffenberg's and Towers' assets and to appoint a trustee and an independent
accountant to manage and audit Towers. It would also prohibit Mr Hoffenberg
from serving as an officer or director of a public company.
The revelations come only weeks after Mr Hoffenberg was hailed as the Post's
guardian angel after he agreed to provide Dollars 300,000 and to guarantee
the Post's Dollars 6m line of credit. The paper's survival has been in
danger since January, when its bankers refused to extend a line of credit
that had jumped to Dollars 6m from Dollars 3m. The newspaper's deficit is
estimated at about Dollars 5m for last year.
Even before yesterday's SEC suit, Mr Hoffenberg was considered a dubious
white knight, with a history of abortive takeovers. The paper has seen a
string of defections by editors to its rival, the Daily News, recently
rescued by Mr Mortimer Zuckerman.
In a story in yesterday's Post, the editor said Towers had been under
investigation by the SEC for six years. But the prospect of a court room
debacle has not cooled Mr Hoffenberg's enthusiasm. In a separate article he
told readers 'Get ready, New York. You're getting a street-fighting
publisher and I'm going to work directly for you.'

<TEXT>
THE remnants of one of the shooting stars of the Madrid bourse in the 1980s
are to be fought over at an extraordinary shareholders meeting of the
Hispano Suiza group in Madrid on Thursday with the sudden emergence of two
bids for its remaining assets.
It emerged yesterday that Azkoyen, a Pamplona-based producer of vending
machines, has bid for the 92 per cent of Hispano Suiza owned by a consortium
of blue chip UK financial companies.
The bid values Hispano Suiza at just Pta492m (Dollars 4.24m), a far cry from
the Pta3bn it was once worth on the market.
That bid may block one made a few weeks ago by a consortium led by Mr Juan
Abello, a Spanish financier, with support from the Bonomi family of Italy,
which controls the Saffa paper group.
The Abello bid was worth Pta1.011bn but only included Hispano Suiza's
profitable building materials companies.
Thursday's meeting was called to approve the Abello bid but shareholders may
now reconsider.

Hispano Suiza was undone by the recession in the Spanish construction

SAFEWAY, the California-based supermarket group, yesterday unveiled plans to
cut its corporate administrative staff, contributing to a charge against
fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 13.8m, or 12 cents a share.
The charge will also cover the cost of consolidating Safeway's distribution
centre in Sacramento into a new centre in Tracy, California. Safeway, which
employs about 1,000 people in corporate administration, did not say how many
might lose their jobs.
In addition, Safeway said it might be forced to abandon the Alberta, Canada
market, because of high labour costs. Mr Peter Magowan, chairman and chief
executive, said: 'While we share similar labour costs with our principal
competitors, we have a problem in our Alberta market caused by the entry of
new competitors whose labour costs are substantially below ours.'
Mr Magowan blamed the labour costs for a significant drop in fourth-quarter
profits in Alberta and predicted that operating profits for 1993 from
Alberta would fall as much as Dollars 50m.
The company's overall earnings for 1992 were depressed by tough competition
in the US food retail industry.
In the 1992 fourth quarter, Safeway earned Dollars 22.2m, or 19 cents a
share, against a net loss of Dollars 47.7m, or 48 cents, a year earlier.
Sales rose to Dollars 4.85bn from Dollars 4.66bn.
For the whole of 1992, Safeway earned Dollars 43.5m, or 37 cents compared

15.15bn against Dollars 15.12bn in 1991.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE bankruptcy trustee of Castor Holdings, the Montreal-based property
finance group backed largely by European investors, is considering further
legal action against Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg, the German-Canadian financier,
and others involved in Castor's collapse.
An official of Richter and Associates, the trustee, said yesterday that
investigations were continuing into the 'massive discrepancy' between
Castor's assets and its liabilities.
A decision on further action is expected within the next month or so.
Richter began proceedings last December to recover CDollars 24m (USDollars
18.8m) which Mr Stolzenberg allegedly appropriated from Castor for his
personal gain.
Richter won a court order to seize Mr Stolzenberg's personal assets in
Canada, including a house and three penthouses in Montreal and two luxury
cars.
The trustee has also sued Castor's other directors, alleging they approved a
dividend payout when the company was insolvent.
Castor, which specialised in high-risk second and third mortgages and
construction loans, went into bankruptcy last July.
Although the value of its assets was set at CDollars 1.9bn in 1991,
creditors are likely to lose at least CDollars 1bn.
Castor's creditors are mostly European banks and private investors who were
drawn by a combination of the North American property boom in the 1980s and
by tax benefits which Castor obtained by channelling much of its business
through offshore tax havens.
Mr Stolzenberg has filed a motion seeking to overturn last December's court
order on the grounds that the trustee failed to reveal all the facts of the
case.
Mr Neil Stein, a Montreal lawyer who represents Castor, added yesterday that
'most of the facts are denied'.
Mr Stolzenberg, who lives in London, has flown to Montreal twice in the past
few weeks to be interviewed by the trustee.
Mr Stein said that Castor's other directors would also contest the trustee's
claims.
Mr Stolzenberg last December sold a controlling interest in Imry Merchant
Developers, the UK property group, as part of a restructuring of Imry's debt
by Barclays Bank. Castor's creditors have sought to establish a link between
the Montreal company and Imry.
Mr Stein said that the only link was the use of a Castor offshore subsidiary
in an earlier Imry refinancing 'for technical, tax treaty reasons'.
The funds channelled through the subsidiary were guaranteed by a term
deposit for the same amount. Mr Stein said that 'not one cent of Castor's
money' was used.

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Savoy Pictures seeks share
listing after public issue

<TEXT>
SAVOY PICTURES Entertainment, the recently formed US film production company
whose investors include the Pritzker family, Italy's Mr Silvio Berlusconi
and Carlton Communications of the UK, is planning to raise about Dollars 30m
by way of a public share offer aimed at quoting the company on the Nasdaq
over-the-counter stock market.
Proceeds of the share offer, which would be added to Savoy's current paid-in
capital of Dollars 165m, are expected to be used to help finance a roster of
more than a dozen movies that could establish Savoy as a new competitor
among the traditional Hollywood major studios.
Savoy is headed by Mr Victor Kaufman, who was president of Columbia Pictures
before it was acquired in 1989 by Sony of Japan.
Although formed only a year ago, the company is already on track to spend
about Dollars 250m a year producing and releasing feature movies.
An indication of the scale of Savoy's ambitions is the initial roster of
films underway. These include Mr Robert De Niro's debut as a director of A
Bronx Tale and films to be directed by Sir Richard Attenborough and Mr Mike
Nichols.
Savoy is also planning films to be produced in association with the
entertainment division of CBS Television and with Mr Ray Stark, the veteran
Hollywood producer. Savoy has already committed Dollars 46m to acquire film
projects.
Allen &amp; Company, the New York investment bank that owns about 9 per cent of
Savoy and is managing underwriter of the new share offer, has an option to
acquire more stock. The initial share offer would place about 12.5 per cent
of Savoy's equity on the stock market.
Savoy, which would have a market capitalisation of between Dollars 208m and
Dollars 240m after the share offer, is now 40 per cent owned by GHK
Investments, a limited partnership managed by Mr Jay Pritzker.
Carlton of the UK holds 9 per cent of Savoy while a further 6 per cent is
held by Home Box Office (HBO), the cable programming subsidiary of Time
Warner, the media and entertainment group. Mr Berlusconi is believed to have
about 5 per cent of the company.

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Amoco narrows exploration focus
 -The US oil group is ditching its 'shotgun approach'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMOCO, the Chicago-based oil company and North America's largest producer of
natural gas, spent last year cutting both production and administration
costs to adjust to lower world energy prices. Now the company is tackling
the costs of its international exploration and development operations.
.Amoco is narrowing its exploration focus. Where it once had operations in
more than 100 countries, it has now reduced this number to 40.
'We had been taking something of a shotgun approach,' said Mr J. C. Burton,
group vice-president in charge of international operations. 'Now we're going
to focus more on bread and butter things. We've decided we can't be
everywhere at once, even though we're a big company.'
He said the new strategy was to prospect only in countries where the
likelihood of finding reserves was high and where Amoco's competitive
advantages could best be deployed. It also entailed managing the group's
reserve portfolio more actively, retaining only those assets fitting in with
core operations.
Last month, for example, Amoco swapped its rights to offshore oil and gas
holdings in the western portion of the North Sea with British Gas's offshore
parcels in the southern North Sea, thereby consolidating its low-cost
holdings there.
Amoco is drawing back from risky frontier exploration and concentrating on
proven basins where it has competitive advantage. In eastern Europe, Amoco
hopes to apply the gasification techniques it developed in its New Mexico
operations to Poland's well-explored coal fields.
Meanwhile, political and technical expertise is being combined in talks with
the Chinese on a Dollars 600m offshore production venture in the South China
Sea.
In addition, a long-term investment in Trinidad, where Amoco is developing
two fields, paid off this year when the company gained tax concessions
there, raising profits.
Amoco entered the global exploration business later than most of its rivals.
While it had longstanding operations in Egypt and Argentina, it did not
begin its worldwide expansion programme until the mid-1980s. This meant it
had to play an expensive game of catch-up.
It found that many low-cost production areas had already been claimed by its
competitors. It also moved into politically unstable countries, such as
Somalia, and then had to abandon sites, so losing substantial investment.
Mr James Murchie, oil industry analyst for Sanford Bernstein, the New York
investment house, says Amoco's frantic frontier exploration boosted the cost
of finding and developing reserves to more than Dollars 6 a barrel, well
above the industry average of about Dollars 5.
Frontier exploration is seen increasingly by the world's oil companies as an
extremely risky business and Amoco's decision to pull back is in keeping
with this trend.
While narrowing its world reach, the bulk of Amoco's exploration and
development expenditure will still be spent outside the US.
The company's 1993 capital spending plan budgets Dollars 3.2bn for
exploration and development, of which 70 per cent will be spent overseas.
Amoco plans to drill about 50 exploration wells in 1993, 90 per cent of them
at foreign sites.
This contradicts the pattern of 1970, when 70 per cent of Amoco's Dollars
647m exploration expenditure was spent at home. Those mature domestic
operations now generate the cash to finance Amoco's hunt for new reserves
overseas.
However, that hunt is behind schedule.
Mr Burton admits the company has not been replacing production at industry
rates over the past two years, but says the exploration cycle has to be
averaged over the long term. 'We try not to get excited about a few bad
years,' he says.
Amoco produces the oil-equivalent of 500m barrels a year. Analysts say
annual exploration and development investment of Dollars 2.5bn would be
required to replace reserves, assuming the industry average cost of Dollars
5 a barrel. This year, Amoco has earmarked only about Dollars 2bn.

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: KOP losses more than doubled

<TEXT>
KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, yesterday
disclosed a FM3.7bn (Dollars 651m) pre-tax loss for 1992 as credit losses
tripled and interest income shrank in the face of the severe domestic
recession. The loss is more than double the FM1.61bn deficit recorded in
1991.
The deterioration, which is symptomatic of the wider crisis in Finnish
banking, came with a warning that the bank would need to strengthen its
capital base this year because of the prospect of further losses.
KOP's interest income fell to FM14.7bn from FM16.2bn while profit from
financial operations dropped 12.7 per cent to FM2.62bn. At the same time,
credit losses tripled to FM4.27bn from FM1.34bn, mainly because of problems
in the corporate sector, while non-performing loans, after write-offs,
soared 41.7 per cent to FM7.1bn, or 7.7 per cent of total lending.
'Soaring interest rates, the collapse of asset values, company failures and
growing unemployment caused serious problems,' said Mr Pertti Voutilainen,
KOP chairman and chief executive. 'Net interest income shrank as a result of
forgone interest income, and lending write-offs saw explosive growth.'
Internal rationalisation, including an 8 per cent cut in staff numbers to
8,500 and a 2 per cent fall in non-interest expenses, was unable to stem the
negative tide.
One bright spot was an 84 per cent increase in non-interest income to
FM1.98bn as a result of successful foreign exchange dealing. This helped to
lift total group income to FM4.60bn from FM4.08bn.
The bank's figures did not include the results of STS-Bank, with which KOP
has recently merged. Non-performing loans at STS amounted to FM2.6bn,
although much of that should be shouldered by the government's guarantee
fund.
KOP said it had started investigating ways of strengthening its capital
base, either through a rights issue or through support from the government
or a combination of both. The bank's international capital adequacy ratio at
the year-end was 9.13 per cent, but this will fall towards 8 per cent during
1993 in the face of further losses. The bank is expected to remain in the
red in both 1993 and 1994.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE difficulties of the French retail sector were highlighted yesterday as a
number of large groups reported flat or falling turnover figures for their
operations last year.
BHV, the department store chain, disclosed a slight fall in sales of 2.3 per
cent to FFr4.1bn (Dollars 732m) from FFr4.27bn in 1991. The Uniprix group of
self-service stores reported static sales, with an increase of 2.6 per cent
to FFr2.3bn.
Other retail concerns, managed to maintain sales growth mainly due to recent
acquisitions.
Galeries Lafayette would have reported static sales without the inclusion of
the Nouvelles Galeries chain which boosted group turnover by 25 per cent to
FFr31.3bn. Promodes, aided by the acquisition of Plaza in Germany, saw sales
rise by 10 per cent to FFr84bn. The Monoprix supermarket group increased
sales by 7.4 per cent last year to FFr10.02bn.
French retailers have been plunged into competitive trading due to the
impact of the economic slowdown and rising unemployment on consumer
confidence. Household expenditure fell in real terms last year, with growth
of just 1.7 per cent against an annual inflation rate of 2.2 per cent,
according to the latest analysis from Credit Lyonnais.
This slowdown in consumer spending has accelerated the restructuring of
French retailing. A number of French companies have made major acquisitions,
including Carrefour and Casino in hypermarkets and Pinault in department
stores.

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Gloom settles over Finnish banks
 -Christopher Brown-Humes reports as the sector is hit by recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, yesterday
inaugurated what will probably be the gloomiest reporting season in Finnish
banking history.
Unitas, the country's number two bank, is expected to reveal a loss of at
least FM3bn (Dollars 528m), after a FM128m profit in 1991, and even bigger
deficits could be reported by Skopbank and the Savings Bank of Finland, both
of which are now under state control. Losses for the whole sector will
amount to FM15bn-FM20bn, more than twice the 1991 level, with non-performing
loans estimated at a staggering FM80bn.
At the heart of the crisis lies the severe Finnish recession, exacerbated by
high real interest rates, which have brought share and property values down
sharply in the past three years and pushed many small and medium-sized
companies into bankruptcy. Credit losses and non-performing loans have
soared.
True, interest rates have come down during the autumn, improving the banks'
margins and share prices have risen strongly since October. But there has
been no let up in the pace of bankruptcies and the amount of non-performing
loans has risen.
The scale of the difficulties has meant that even the extensive
rationalisation measures and major staff reduction programmes being carried
out by many of the banks have made little impact.
'The amount of bad loans is more than the equity of most of the banks. The
value of their shares depends on the extent to which the government is
prepared to help them out,' says Mr Jari Eklund, analyst with KOP Investment
Research.
What made yesterday's KOP statement particularly gloomy was the assessment
that it will take years for the banking system's problems to be resolved.
'Normal levels of profitability will hardly be reached until the late
1990s,' said Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chairman and chief executive. He has
already indicated that KOP is unlikely to return to profit before 1995.
This year the slump in the domestic market will continue, despite the
improved outlook for exports, and it is by no means certain that GNP, which
has fallen 10 per cent in the past two years, will be positive. The problems
in the corporate sector will continue, particularly for companies exposed to
the devaluation of the Finnish markka such as importing companies or those
with big foreign currency loans. At the same time, greater difficulties are
expected in the household sector, with Finnish unemployment now at a record
18.6% level.
Many people in the industry suspect the government may have to offer even
more financial help than it has indicated so far. Last's year FM20bn
guarantee fund has been severely depleted and FM8bn in preference capital
fully utilised. Last week parliament approved a further FM20bn in assistance
for the banks in 1993, and there has been talk of a further FM10bn being
made available in due course.
The best that can be hoped is that things will not get any worse. But for
the banking sector to start pulling out of the crisis, there has to be a
broader economic recovery. Fortunately there are positive signs, including
rising exports and the recent decision by the Bank of Finland to cut base
rates to 7.5 per cent.
In the meantime one of the government's main priorities will be resolving
the future of the Savings Bank of Finland and Skopbank, the central bank of
the savings banks.
Last year Unitas pulled out of talks which might have led to it merging with
both these ailing groups. Then, several weeks ago, KOP revealed that it had
made contact with the state about a possible merger with them.
This news has alarmed the rest of the banking sector, partly because a
combination of the three banks would give KOP an estimated 40 per cent share
of the overall market. The other banks also say the move would distort
competition, if it was effected with the aid of non-repayable state support.
They believe a fairer solution would be for the healthy parts of the two
groups to be divided among all of them, with the bad loans being hived off
into a separate unit.
It is not just a question of Skopbank and the Savings Bank of Finland being
helped out. KOP has already indicated it will almost certainly need a
capital injection this year, and may well need direct support from the
government to prevent its capital adequacy falling below statutory minimums.
By contrast, Unitas shows every sign of wanting to pull through its
difficulties without government support - but it will want to be sure that
its competitive position is not endangered in the process.

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Hafslund posts record profits of
NKr1.5bn

HAFSLUND NYCOMED, the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products,
began Norway's corporate reporting season yesterday by posting record
profits.
Group profit, before extraordinary items and taxes, last year advanced 22
per cent to NKr1.5bn (Dollars 214m) from NKr1.28bn in 1991. The dividend is
being lifted to NKr2.20 a share from NKr1.60, Hafslund said. The A-shares,
nevertheless, closed down NKr4.50 to NKr138.50 in Oslo yesterday.
Hafslund was forced to take a NKr80m charge against last year's accounts
relating to the sale of its metal operations in 1990 to the Ila Lilleby
Group. After the charge, pre-tax profits were, nevertheless, up at NKr1.42bn
from NKr1.28bn in 1991.
The group expects to pay taxes of NKr417m for 1992 compared with NKr468m in
1991. Group sales and royalties last year rose slightly to NKr1.59bn from
NKr1.53bn a year earlier, while research and development expenses increased
by NKr35m to NKr652m.
Last year, group operating profit increased by NKr100m to NKr1.65bn while
operating expenses rose 9 per cent to NKr3.03bn.
Mr Svein Aaser, Hafslund's chief executive, said 1992 had been an unusually
active year in which several acquisitions were made, while approval for
several products was given or sought in several countries. Hafslund also
became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr Aaser refused to give a
forecast for the group for 1993, but said Hafslund's increased dividend
payment suggested how the board saw future development within the company.
Two of Hafslund's three divisions reported increased sales and operating
profits in 1992, while the energy division saw advances restricted by a
'severe' fall in electricity prices on a spot contract basis.

FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Three-week suspension on Norsk
Data share trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the shares of Norsk Data, the troubled Norwegian mini-computer
group, have been suspended for three weeks.
The move came yesterday as the company's talks on debt restructuring with
creditors, which include two Norwegian banks, reached an advanced stage.
Norsk Data has debts estimated at NKr650m (Dollars 92.8m), plus an
outstanding NKr350m German bearer bond programme. The Norsk Data holding
company wants to extend repayments and complete a debt restructuring
package.
Last year, Norsk Data tried to buy back 90 per cent of its DM150m (Dollars
90.6m) of outstanding German bearer bonds, but managed to repurchase just
DM73m. The remainder are due for payment on July 11.
It said the debt restructuring talks, covering 'bourse sensitive'
information, had been expanded to include a 'wider group of creditors'. It
had therefore asked that trading in its shares be suspended.
The group was restructured about 18 months ago into a holding company with
financially independent subsidiaries.
Norsk Data said that last December it had tried to improve the debt position
of the holding company by repurchasing, at 25 per cent of nominal value, a
portion of the German bearer bonds.
It plans to make an announcement on its finances on March 2, when it is due
to publish its 1992 results. If Norsk Data cannot reach a satisfactory deal,
it could seek protection from creditors under Norwegian law.
In 1991, Norsk Data plunged into losses, before year-end allocations, of
NKr810m, against losses of NKr134m in 1990. In 1991 it was forced to take a
NKr655m restructuring charge arising from its transformation into a computer
service company.
In addition to Oslo, London and New York, the company's shares, in the form
of depository receipts, are traded in Stockholm, Frankfurt, Hamburg and
Copenhagen.

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Whessoe seeks Pounds 14.3m to fund
Norwegian buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHESSOE, the acquisitive engineer and controls company, yesterday launched a
surprise Pounds 21.8m bid for Autronica, the Norwegian instrumentation
group, and called on shareholders for the second time in 13 months to help
fund its expansion.
The bid marks the first attempt by a foreign company to acquire a Norwegian
group without prior agreement. Autronica's board, which under Norwegian law
has no obligation to advise shareholders on any offer, has said it will
consider the offer at a board meeting on February 18.
The UK group launched a 1-for-4 rights issue at 260p to raise Pounds 14.3m
towards the purchase of Oslo-quoted Autronica. The balance would be funded
with Whessoe's cash resources, leaving it with neither debt nor cash in the
ank.
The issue, which follows an Pounds 8m rights in 1991 to purchase Varec, a US
tank gauge manufacturer, is not conditional on the purchase. If the bid
fails, the proceeds would be used for further acquisitions.
Mr Christopher Fleetwood, chief executive, said Autronica would
'significantly extend the horizons of Whessoe'. The Norwegian company had a
recognised name in engine controls, radar gauges and fire detection systems.
Its products would complement those offered by Whessoe in its
instrumentation division.
However, Autronica incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.3m on sales of Pounds
28.7m for the eight months to August 31. Debt was Pounds 7.2m at the end of
December 1991. The company, which recently lost its financial director and
managing director, had already taken steps to restructure, Mr Fleetwood
said. Its own board expected to break even in the full year.
Mr Fleetwood said if the bid was successful, Autronica expected to make a
positive contribution in its first full year.
Whessoe is offering NKr85 per Autronica share. The Norwegian group's shares
closed NKr40 higher in Oslo at NKr81.
Whessoe has also paid Pounds 255,000 for call options over 56.8 per cent of
Autronica's shares at NKr85.
The bulk of these options were granted by Securitas, one of Autronica's
largest customers and a significant shareholder with two board
representatives.
Whessoe said it had agreed a minimum purchase deal with Securitas, assuming
the bid succeeds, in return for offering a volume discount on Autronica's
products.
The offer is conditional on receiving acceptances from two thirds of the
issued share capital, and approval from both Whessoe shareholders and the
Norwegian authorities.
Whessoe's shares fell 10p to close at 304p. The share price, which fell to a
low of 208p this summer, has recovered sharply since the announcement of a
13 per cent increase in pre-tax profits last December.

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: An intensification of divided opinions -
Peter John looks at the transatlantic division surrounding two of the UK's
biggest stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK AND US investors may be committed to similar financial goals but they do
not always see things the same way.
Divided views on leading stocks have always existed and make for healthy
financial markets. However, the transatlantic division on some of the
biggest British stocks has intensified recently.
Nothing exemplifies this better than their respective attitudes towards
Glaxo and British Petroleum.
Many US institutions have decided on the one hand they will not touch Glaxo
shares but on the other they cannot get enough of BP.
However, their UK counterparts, by and large, hold the opposite view.
The conflicting opinions have led to a lively push-and-pull in the stock
markets. The two companies have such a high market value that these diverse
movements have implications for the whole London stock market.
A 10p shift (1.5 per cent) in the price of Glaxo shares moves the FT-SE 100
Index by almost 2 points and the Glaxo share price has fallen nearly 150p
since the start of the year. A 10p move (4 per cent) by BP shifts the
Footsie by just under 3.5 points but the shares have risen only 20p since
the beginning of January.
In London, investors are happy to buy Glaxo having watched its shares fall
from 800p at the beginning of the year to within a whisker of their 18-month
low. Analysts have argued for the past couple of weeks that the
traditionally highly rated stock is now on a similar rating and yield to the
market. Yet they have watched bemused as it has fallen further.
Mr James Culverwell, Hoare Govett's health and household sector analyst,
advised his clients to buy the classically defensive UK drug stocks three
weeks ago. He felt that worries about US pricing reforms pledged by
President Bill Clinton were already in the weakened share prices and hopes
for economic recovery were premature.
'US investors are very fickle; a year ago they judged drug companies on
fundamentals and now they are looking at growth prospects. They are also
herd-like; a US institution starts selling and by the time it stops the
message is just filtering through to the small investor.'
Indeed, many of the Glaxo shares sold recently have been bought by US retail
investors.
One US analyst believes the UK is slightly precious about its high profile
drugs groups because it has so few. He adds that many of the UK
institutional investors missed out on the sharp rise in Glaxo's share price
a couple of years ago and are not prepared to be caught out again.
In the US, says Ms Christina Heuer, of Smith Barney, 'the drugs sector has
been slaughtered since the realisation that growth rates have fallen below
10 per cent and margins were slimming down.
She was long one of Glaxo's most enthusiastic supporters but now she advises
clients to maintain a neutral stance on the stock. She has reduced her
earnings per share forecast for the year to June to 39p but points out that
the stake held by US investors in the form of American Depositary Receipts
has held constant at 23.8 per cent since November as institutional selling
is mopped up by smaller investors.
With BP, the international roles are reversed. London has taken a dim view
of the company for some time but particularly since it cut the dividend last
year.
Mr John Toalster, of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, was one of the first
analysts to turn his back on the stock. 'BP is a victim of its past mistakes
and its future is a hostage to oil prices and currency movements. A modest
share rating is needed to reflect the slow recovery of a patient which will
not be in the best of health even after convalescence,' he says arguing that
a fair value for the share price is currently about 175p.
Last week, however, the US holding of BP shares hit 23 per cent having risen
from 8.4 per cent a year earlier.
Mr Bill Randall, of Salomon Brothers, is slightly cautious on the shares
ahead of the Opec meeting at the end of next week but broadly believes that
the oil company is ready to move ahead.
'We think the restructuring and cost cutting that they have started will put
the company in a much more solvent situation and the shares will prove a
good long-term investment.'
The US view on BP appears to have been gaining ground over the past week and
the shares have risen 13 1/2 p to 267 1/2 p in London. Meanwhile, Glaxo
shares have fallen a further 11p to 667p.

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Marginal increase by Noble Grossart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBLE GROSSART, the small Edinburgh merchant bank co-founded and managed by
Mr Angus Grossart, increased its pre-tax profits marginally from Pounds
3.35m to Pounds 3.4m in the year to January 31 1993.
Mr Grossart said the bank had been extremely busy in all areas and the
client list continued to strengthen. Noble Grossart was involved in several
reshaping and restructuring exercises, he said.
He said it was 'consistent performance which matters in the financial sector
and those who soar in good times are often likely to be the first to plunge
in adversity. There are no short cuts in merchant banking.'
The bank does not reveal its turnover or fee income. The accounts show that
Noble Grossart's income from unlisted investments went down from Pounds
566,000 to Pounds 214,000.
Mr Grossart said that in a difficult climate for unlisted investments 'we
have no major current problems.'

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Downiebrae shares surge 22p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Downiebrae Holdings, the Glasgow-based engineering company,
yesterday jumped 22p to 53p on news that Mr Robert Newman, the accountant
and takeover specialist, had bought back into the company by paying Pounds
2.25m for a 29.99 per cent stake.
Mr Newman, who helped mastermind the evolution of The Times Veneer, a wood
products company which was also little more than a shell, into Era Group in
the 1980s, said he planned to use Downiebrae as an acquisition vehicle.
He acquired the 5.25m shares, at 42.85p apiece, via the family-controlled
Braystar investment company from Mr Jacques Murray, the outgoing chief
executive who originally bought the stake from Mr Newman in February 1988.
Mr Murray and his associate, Mr Andrew Chudnoff, have resigned from
Downiebrae's board and have been replaced by Mr Newman and Mr Denys Cole.
Mr Newman, who will be Downiebrae's chief executive, said the company was
'the perfect vehicle for acquisitions' with Pounds 4.7m of cash, two
properties and two northern-based engineering businesses.
He said yesterday that he planned to use the company to expand in
engineering or other fields.
In October Downiebrae reported a decline in first half pre-tax profits to
Pounds 152,000 (Pounds 241,000). The company, which makes pipe flanges and
cuts steel profiles, said that no immediate improvement was foreseen.
Turnover increased to Pounds 822,000 (Pounds 808,000) and earnings per share
were 0.7p (1.07p).
Mr Murray, who is chairman of Nu-Swift, was recently involved in a failed
bid to win control of the board of Andrews Sykes, the specialist industrial
services group where he also owns a 29.2 per cent stake.

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Wills jumps 86% and bids for Platon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR DUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wills Group, the industrial, electronic and automotive products company,
announced pre-tax profits up 86 per cent, from Pounds 154,000 to Pounds
287,000, in the six months to December 31.
An interim dividend of 0.1p is declared - the first for some years - from
earnings of 0.3p per share, against 0.27p.
In line with its intention of expanding product ranges and distribution
channels, Wills is following up December's acquisition of Lightfoot
Refrigeration with a Pounds 2.7m offer for Platon International, the
USM-quoted instrumentation group, which incurred a loss of Pounds 480,000
for 1991-92.
Wills is also raising some Pounds 5.4m via a 1-for-3 rights issue at 16p a
share.
The rights is not conditional on the Platon offer becoming unconditional.
Turnover of Wills in the first half rose from Pounds 7.27m to Pounds 8m and
Mr David Massie, chairman, said that the trend was in the right direction
with traditionally more favourable trading conditions prevailing in the
second half of the year.

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: New operations and franchises help lift
Ramsden's to Pounds 0.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARRY Ramsden's, the USM-quoted fish and chip restaurant operator, achieved
an 8 per cent profits improvement to Pounds 607,812 pre-tax for the year to
September 29.
The shares responded with a 5p rise to 140p.
Joint venture and franchise operations helped bolster turnover from Pounds
2.1m to Pounds 2.87m.
The pre-tax figure was held back by a fall in interest income to Pounds
15,388 (Pounds 115,960), reflecting investment of cash balances into new
operations.
The company operates six restaurants in the UK and has plans for further
openings in Edinburgh, Birmingham and Bristol this year.
In addition it has agreed commitments from joint venture partners in
Cardiff, Belfast, Dublin and Aberdeen where site searches are under way.
Directors said the company's first international operation, opened in Hong
Kong in August, was achieving 'sales levels equal to our UK restaurant
average sales'.
Strong interest was being shown in the Pacific Rim from new prospective
partners. Site searches were also under way in Jeddah following the
completion of a franchise agreement with a substantial Saudi operator.
The results to date of Merryweathers, the chain of fish and chip takeaways
acquired for Pounds 600,000 last March, were in line with expectations.
The annual dividend is maintained at 4.5p via a same-again final of 3.5p.
Earnings emerged at 7.2p (6.8p) per share.
Consolidated net debt at the year-end totalled Pounds 237,379.

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Zurich offshoot in new stop-loss scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARTICIPATION of Centre Re, the financial reinsurance subsidiary of
Zurich Insurance, in a new stop-loss insurance scheme could herald the
broader participation of international reinsurers in the market, according
to Mr John Harrison, a specialist stop loss insurance broker with SBJ
Harrison Stuart, a subsidiary of Steel Burrill Jones.
SBJ announced on Friday that Centre Re and a group of Lloyd's underwriters
would support a stop-loss arrangement for 1993 covering some 3,000 of
Lloyd's 19,700 Names.
Centre Re will provide 80 per cent of the reinsurance cover.
The deal has helped to shore up the stop-loss market at Lloyd's, which has
been badly hit by heavy losses in recent years.
One of the founders of the stop loss market, Mr Michael Wade, recently left
brokers Holman Wade after a dispute with the company's owners, Horace
Clarkson, about the cost of servicing old claims.
Under the SBJ scheme Names, the individuals whose assets support Lloyd's,
would pay about 1 per cent of their stamp capacity (the amount of premium
they are allowed to underwrite) to buy stop loss policies which would cover
all losses above 25 per cent and up to 80 per cent of their stamp over a
four year period.
Premiums - which would typically average about Pounds 4,200 a year - are
paid into a new mutual club, known as Integer, which will then reinsure with
the Bermuda-based Centre Re.
Names' losses above an amount equal to 80 per cent of capacity (again over a
four year period) are paid from a special Lloyd's fund, following reforms
that were introduced last year.
Mr Harrison said that under the 'primary aggregate reinsurance policy'
reinsurers would pay 100 per cent of all claims suffered by Integer up to an
amount equal to 15 per cent of the total exposure of Integer's Names.
Any claims above this amount would be met by Integer, with the proportions
paid of each claim depending on funds available.
Integer would pay three quarters of its net premium income (after 5 per cent
management fees and 5 per cent brokerage commission) to Centre Re, an amount
which Mr Harrison expects to equal Pounds 10m in 1993.

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: John Menzies shows sharp improvement to
Pounds 3.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Menzies, chairman of the Edinburgh-based retail and wholesale group
which bears his name, said the company had 'produced a result which is
satisfactory within the overall economic environment' when it revealed a
jump in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 3.8m in the six months to
October 31.
The shares rose 16p to 482p.
In August, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission initiated an investigation
 -scheduled to be completed by July - into the wholesale distribution of
newspapers in England and Wales, territories where, according to Mr Ranald
Noel-Paton, group managing director, Menzies has a market share of about
16.5 per cent.
He said he was confident of a 'favourable outcome', stressing that the MMC's
brief was for newspapers only, not magazines and periodicals, and did not
cover Scotland, where Menzies is strong. Its UK market share is about 20 per
cent.
On the distribution side, Mr Noel-Paton said that turnover at John Menzies
Wholesale rose 12 per cent.
TBD, now including Hammick's book wholesale division since the sale of the
Hammick's retail bookshop chain, saw turnover fall, partly because of the
drop in consumer demand for recorded music. Mr Noel-Paton said this was a
recessionary downturn, but also influenced by the impact of video games and
a lack of availability of good new product - 'it's hard to get too excited
by the latest compilation of Abba hits'.
Turnover at Universal Office Supplies was up 12 per cent 'in a flat market',
and 20 per cent when RMG, acquired for about Pounds 2.5m from Waverley
Cameron in August, was included.
The 274-strong John Menzies retail chain was 'resilient' with turnover 'flat
in real terms', though it traded below budget.
The 171 Early Learning Centres in the UK achieved a 10 per cent turnover
rise 'with no erosion of margin'. Apart from the small wholesale business
which was sold to its management, Early Learning Inc, the US operation, will
be completely closed by the end of February. Mr Noel-Paton said: 'We did
everything possible to effect a sale and led a lot of horses to water, but
none of them drank.'
Group turnover grew to Pounds 531.9m (Pounds 489.3m) and interest charges
fell Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 1.6m. Earnings emerged at 2.9p (0.9p) per
share and the interim dividend is lifted to 3.8p (3.6p).

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Butte Mining losses double to Pounds 13.5m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BUTTE MINING, which is claiming damages of at least Dollars 325m (Pounds
214m) in the US against more than 70 former directors, advisers and
investors, saw losses before tax for the year to June 30 nearly double from
Pounds 7m to Pounds 13.5m, writes Kenneth Gooding.
The latest figures included an exceptional Pounds 8.7m loss from writing
down all assets to 'values that should be realisable in today's economic
climate,' said Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman.
He said that the new management team had investigated circumstances
surrounding two acquisitions in Montana and the purchase of Gramcol-Zircon
in the UK. 'Serious deficiencies were discovered,' he said. Litigation and
warranty claims have been started and information passed to the Serious
Fraud Office, 'which is investigating all three transactions.'

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Airtours holders take up 83% of convertible
pref offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS IN Airtours, the holiday company bidding for rival Owners
Abroad, have taken up 83 per cent of the convertible preference shares
available under a fully underwritten offer to raise Pounds 49.5m.
About 24.2m of the 50.6m shares on offer - representing the entitlement of
Airtours' directors - were firmly pre-placed with institutional investors.
As a result, shareholders who are not directors clawed back only 67.5 per
cent of their entitlement from institutions where the shares had been
conditionally placed.
Airtours announced the placing at the time of its bid but the placing was
not conditional on the bid being accepted by Owners Abroad shareholders.
Advisers for Airtours said they were pleased with the placing.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, said the result of the open offer
raised 'serious concerns as to the underlying value of Airtours' shares'
which, he said 'represent an unattractive and vulnerable investment.'
Airtours offer for Owners Abroad contains only a partial cash alternative.
Airtours' shares slipped 1p to 280p yesterday, valuing the bid at Pounds
208.9m.
The company has said that if its offer is not accepted by Owners Abroad
shareholders, the Pounds 49.5m raised will be used to expand Airtours' tour
operating and travel agency businesses.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said that unlike Owners Abroad,
Airtours had managed to extract consistent growth in value for shareholders.
He said that bookings for the winter season were currently 19 per cent ahead
of the same period last year while for the 1993 summer season they were 12
per cent ahead.

FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Peter Black rises 27% on back of interest
cost cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCED interest costs and improved margins lay behind a 27 per cent advance
in interim pre-tax profit at Peter Black Holdings, the personal care and
footwear group.
The share price rose 14p to close at 180p, its highest level for four years.
The pre-tax profit increase from Pounds 4.52m to Pounds 5.73m was struck on
flat turnover of Pounds 61.1m (Pounds 60.5m) in the six months to November
28. Nearly two thirds of sales are to Marks and Spencer. Operating profit
rose nearly 7 per cent to Pounds 6.15m (Pounds 5.76m).
Interest costs were cut from Pounds 1.24m to Pounds 419,000. Mr Stephen
Lister, finance director, said internal cash generation had reduced net debt
to Pounds 3.6m - gearing of 9 per cent - compared with Pounds 10.5m in
November 1991.
In the personal care division, like-for-like turnover was flat at Pounds 21m
(Pounds 22m) after allowing for a small disposal. Pre-tax profit rose to
Pounds 2.65m (Pounds 2m).
Mr Gordon Black, joint chairman whose family controls 39 per cent of the
equity, said sales of toiletries and gifts were satisfactory, but the
cosmetics market remained difficult. Benefits flowed through from the
concentration of production on one site instead of two, a move made in late
1991.
At English Grains, the own-label business had done better than the brands.
The company made about 1.5bn pills a year, with vitamins as the biggest
sellers, and capacity was being increased.
In footwear and accessories, pre-tax profit grew to Pounds 2.23m (Pounds
1.75m) on turnover of Pounds 33.1m (Pounds 31.8m). Sales rose at Newbold,
which makes fashion shoes for M and S and other retailers, and in the import
business. At the Keighley footwear and accessories subsidiary, profit
improvement came from enhanced efficiency.
Distribution - which encompasses contracts for more than 30 companies - and
leisure/retail at Hornsea Freeport together increased profits to Pounds
845,000 (Pounds 762,000) on sales of Pounds 7m (Pounds 6.69m).
Earnings per share rose to 7.05p (5.56p) and the interim dividend goes up to
0.93p (0.77p).
COMMENT
Peter Black's revival has been given a fair wind by the resilient M and S,
but the management also played its hand well. Signs of this are the
financial discipline that has led to debt and stock reduction, rationalised
production and expansion of third party distribution. Within the M and S
circle Black is serving areas of potential in women's shoes and cosmetics.
Outside it, progress continues to be made in sales to other retailers. With
profit growth restored on sluggish turnover, a significant increase in
demand would have a rapid impact on the bottom line. With profits weighted
towards the first half, a full-year figure of Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 6.6m) is
forecast, giving a p/e of 17.5. The share price has shot up by nearly three
quarters in less than three months and so the bargain days are gone. It
remains worth holding.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Salomon sets up triple-A rated derivatives unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALOMON Brothers has set up a separate subsidiary, with a triple A credit
rating, through which to channel swaps and options business, in a move which
other US banks and securities houses are expected to follow.
The declining credit quality of many US financial institutions has proved a
severe handicap in the lucrative derivatives market, since many potential
clients are unwilling to deal with institutions rated less than double A.
Salomon, like a number of other US banks with single A ratings, has been
struggling to maintain its market share against triple A rated entities like
Morgan Guaranty and Union Bank of Switzerland.
'We believe separately-capitalised subsidiaries are the wave of the future,'
said Mr Myron Scholes, co-head of fixed income derivatives at Salomon in New
York.
Lehman Brothers, Continental, Chase Manhattan and Kidder Peabody are among
the institutions known to be considering this route. The first such
separately-capitalised unit was created by Merrill Lynch 14 months ago. In
assessing the Salomon Brothers structure, the credit rating agencies have
relaxed the initial capital requirement because the amount of capital will
be adjusted according to the level of credit risk. All market risk is
assumed by Salomon Brothers, which then provides extra capital to Swapco.
The Salomon unit, Salomon Swapco, will have equity capital of Dollars 175m,
compared with the Dollars 350m capitalisation of Merrill Lynch Derivative
Products.
Swapco can deal with any investment grade - or high-quality but unrated -
clients, while MLDP can only deal with clients rated double A or better.
According to Mr Flavio Bartmann, a managing director of Merrill Lynch,
Salomon has 'obtained extra flexibility and half the capital requirement,
but that is somewhat at the expense of the counterparty'.
One of the elements of the structure is that certain events, such as the
bankruptcy of Salomon Brothers, trigger the termination of Swapco contracts,
causing potential problems for clients. Although the unit has been rated
triple A by Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch, S&amp;P created a new triple-A
category, by adding the subscript 'T' to the rating, drawing attention to
the termination clause.
'People want to separate the tremendous economic function of derivatives
from the credit risk baggage that comes along with it,' said Mr Richard
Stuckey, co-head of fixed income derivatives.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Charterhouse deal confounds the sceptics: Robert Peston
explains the latest cross-border banking marriage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was no shortage of doubters in the City of London last year when Mr
Victor Blank, chairman of Charterhouse, said he was hoping to marry his UK
merchant bank to a consortium of continental financial institutions.
The UK recession and the lukewarm commitment of the British government to
the cause of European monetary union had caused some continental banks and
investment firms to reassess whether they really needed a substantial
presence in the City.
However, Mr Blank was yesterday able to announce that Credit Commercial de
France, the French Bank, and the German Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter
Bank had agreed after months of negotiation to buy jointly a 90.1 per cent
stake in Charterhouse.
The deal has a complicated structure.
Royal Bank of Scotland, which has owned Charterhouse since January 1985,
will retain a holding of just under 10 per cent.
The Scottish clearing bank will also keep the capital markets division,
which trades debt securities, and the Scottish part of its development
capital business, which finances company buy-outs. RBS will receive Pounds
149m in cash, and a separate dividend of Pounds 12.2m.
Mr Ken Thompson, RBS finance director, said it was receiving slightly less
than the book value - the value in its balance sheet - of Charterhouse's
assets.
'In the current economic climate, I think we did well to get that price,' he
said.
There has been a reappraisal of the value of UK merchant banking businesses
since autumn 1989, when Deutsche Bank, Germany's leading bank, paid Pounds
950m to buy the merchant bank Morgan Grenfell. That price was equal to 2.7
times the book value of Morgan's assets.
However, Charterhouse would always have sold for relatively less than its
rival, because Morgan has a much stronger presence in the highly valued
corporate advisory market and Charterhouse has a stronger position in
development capital, which traditionally sells at a discount to book value.
A third factor militating against a high price for Charterhouse is that a
glut of merchant banks has come on the market in the past year. Henry
Ansbacher, the small merchant bank, has just been sold to First National
Bank of South Africa and Brown Shipley is in the process of being sold to
Kredietbank of Luxembourg.
Meanwhile TSB Group has said it would sell Hill Samuel if offered an
acceptable price - which many have interpreted as a coded invitation for
bidders.
Kleinwort Benson, on the other hand, has had sporadic talks with Banque
National de Paris of France - which already owns 4.8 per cent cent of KB -
and Dresdner Bank of Germany about the possibility of those two banks taking
significant stakes in it.
The Charterhouse deal also highlights two other City trends:
The clearing banks which bought or invested in merchant banks and
stockbrokers in the mid-1980s, to take advantage of the deregulation of the
UK securities market, have been re-appraising those investments.
UK merchant banks are increasingly striving to establish links with their
continental peers to take advantage of the growing demand from companies for
advice on cross-border deals within the European Community.
The value of cross-border takeovers within the EC last year was Pounds
29.1bn, 51 per cent up on the previous year, but below the peak of Pounds
33.5bn in 1990, according to Acquisitions Monthly.
Mr Blank said that a desire to win a greater share of this market was one of
the strongest motives for all participants in the sale of his bank to the
two continental institutions.
There are precedents for the success of such merchant banking links.
Mr David Verey, chairman of the City firm Lazard, said: 'A domestic presence
combined with a strong multinational presence is essential to doing the job
effectively.'
Lazard's success in the cross-border market stems in part from a close
relationship with its sister business in Paris, Lazard Freres.
Morgan Grenfell's chief executive, Mr Michael Dobson, said it had been
'enormously helpful' to have Deutsche as parent. He said: '75 per cent of
our corporate finance deals last year were cross-border deals. In 1987, the
proportion was 16 per cent.'
However, a close relationship with a powerful continental bank is not
essential to success. SG Warburg of the UK and Goldman Sachs of the US are
two of the most consistently successful in advising on cross-border deals.
Both have tapped the market as independent operators.
Meanwhile the investment banking operations of the UK clearing banks have
not been notably successful either in their domestic markets or
internationally. The clearers have therefore been deciding whether to sell
or close these operations or try to integrate them more closely into their
commercial banking operations.
Both Barclays and National Westminster Bank have taken the latter course,
though NatWest's reorganisation of its investment bank has been the more
radical of the two.
Lloyds closed its merchant bank last year. RBS would have absorbed
Charterhouse into its banking operations if it had been unable to find a
buyer for it.
Charterhouse's executives, who thrived on the autonomy given to them for
years by RBS, are therefore relieved that the sale is going through. Mr
Blank's next trick, generating new business following the takeover, will be
tougher.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Time-Warner strikes first profit since takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIME-WARNER, the US media group, yesterday reported its first annual net
profit since the publishing group, Time, merged with entertainment company
Warner in 1989. It made Dollars 86m (Pounds 56.9m) in 1992, against a loss
of Dollars 99m in 1991.
Fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 68m, up from Dollars 45m in the same
period of 1991, thanks to higher operating profits at each of Time-Warner's
five divisions.
Time-Warner tries to concentrate Wall Street attention on its earnings
before interest, taxes, appreciation and amortisation, on the grounds that
its underlying performance is distorted both by its debt burden and by heavy
non-cash amortisation charges, which totalled more than Dollars 500m in both
1991 and 1992.
On this basis, profits rose 8 per cent in the fourth quarter, from Dollars
677m to Dollars 731m, and 11 per cent during the year, from Dollars 2.26bn
to Dollars 2.51bn. Revenues for the quarter totalled Dollars 3.72bn, against
Dollars 3.39bn, and for the year Dollars 13.07bn, against Dollars 12.02bn.
However, at earnings per share level, the company's profits translated into
losses. It reported a loss of 25 cents a share in the quarter, down from 29
cents a year ago, and a loss of Dollars 1.46 for the year, down from Dollars
2.40.
The group's publishing division reported operating profits of Dollars 132m
in the quarter (Dollars 124m), and Dollars 328m for 1992 (Dollars 246m).
The filmed entertainment division rose to Dollars 92m in the quarter
(Dollars 90m), and Dollars 410m for the year, up from Dollars 390m. The
company said strong US box office results from the films The Bodyguard and
Forever Young helped the quarter.

FT  09 FEB 93 / MPs ask for DTI inquiry into Lilley collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Labour MPs has called for a Department of Trade and Industry
inquiry into the collapse of Lilley, the Glasgow-based construction group,
which went into receivership on January 7.
The MPs, who include Mr Alistair Darling and Ms Joyce Quin from the party's
front bench, used a parliamentary early day motion to ask for a 'full and
independent' DTI inquiry and indicated they were 'increasingly concerned' at
events leading up to the company's collapse.
The House of Commons motion states 'adjustments were made to the accounts by
writing down the value of works in progress, speculative buildings were sold
into the company's pension fund when no other buyer could be found . . . the
flow of funds to pay sub-contractors was held up and profitable subsidiaries
were sucked dry of funds to prop up the failing property development section
of the company, resulting in a deterioration of Pounds 16m in the company's
(results) from a Pounds 7m published profit in 1991 to a deficit of Pounds
9m in 1992'.
There has been anger in the Scottish business community at the collapse of
Lilley, which had debts of more than Pounds 80m of which Pounds 20m were
off-balance sheet. Many sub-contractors are among the unsecured creditors.
Initially anger was directed at the failure of two banks, the Glasgow-based
Clydesdale, and Hill Samuel, part of TSB Group, to back a Pounds 45m rescue
package, thus pushing the company into receivership.
Last week the Glasgow-based Herald newspaper attacked Sir Lewis Robertson,
who had chaired Lilley since 1986, alleging that he was responsible for
Lilley's mismanagement.
Lilley had net assets of Pounds 47m at the end of 1991 but these had become
net liabilities of Pounds 13m at the end of 1992, when it had an urgent need
of Pounds 16m in cash.
Price Waterhouse, the receivers, expect this week to sell the share capital
of Lilley's subsidiary Robison &amp; Davidson, a Dumfries-based housebuilder and
contractor, to a management buy-out. Robison &amp; Davidson was the only trading
subsidiary of Lilley not in receivership.
While most Lilley subsidiaries had their cash stripped out by the parent
company in the months before it collapsed, Robison &amp; Davidson retained most
of its cash, enabling it to stay solvent.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Enterprise Oil sells North Sea interests to Japan for
Dollars 106m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENTERPRISE Oil, the independent UK oil exploration and production company,
has sold interests in three North Sea oilfields to C. Itoh Energy
Development, a unit of Japan's Itochu Corporation, the diversified trading
house, for Dollars 106m (Pounds 70m) in cash.
'We are essentially looking to maintain the balance between our financial
and our physical assets and we will be reinvesting the proceeds from the
sale,' said Mr John Walmsley, finance director at Enterprise Oil.
Last year, Enterprise raised Pounds 240m as part of a share offering in the
US which, combined with yesterday's deal, will reduce the company's
debt-to-equity ratio to just over 40 per cent.
Mr Simon Flowers, industry analyst at NatWest Securities in Edinburgh,
estimates the company should gain Pounds 25m in net profit from the deal.
This could increase net income for last year to Pounds 82m or 18.2p a share
from a previously-estimated level of 12p to 13p a share.
Mr Flowers said the deal made the difference between a covered and uncovered
dividend for 1992, but Mr Walmsley rejected this.
Enterprise is committed to paying a dividend of 15.75p a share.
The assets include Enterprise's interests in Hudson, Hutton and North West
Hutton where production is currently around 5,000 barrels a day (b/d) and
will rise to 11,000 b/d by the end of the decade.
Mr Walmsley said the deal represented 'full value' for the Enterprise
assets. He said there was a sign of a selective pick-up in the market for
North Sea interests after the dearth of activity in the last year. 'It is a
market sharply defined by quality of assets,' he said.
Lasmo, another UK exploration and production company last week sold assets
for Pounds 126.5m.
'There are not so many cash buyers around as there were in 1988 to 1990, but
these deals are encouraging for exploration companies,' said Mr Flowers.
CIECO, a newly-formed company which is 20 per cent owned by Japan's Taiyo
Oil Corporation, becomes only the second Japanese company to own a producing
asset in the North Sea.

FT  09 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling's inability to hold early levels around DM2.41 yesterday suggests
that, this time round, exchange markets were disinclined to believe the UK
Sunday papers. Reports that the Treasury and Bank of England do not want any
further rate cuts are not particularly convincing in the light of the
authorities' actual behaviour since sterling left the ERM. The over-riding
message is that the government is aiming for a resumption of growth, which
could well mean lower base rates around budget time. It is difficult to
avoid the implication that sterling must have further to fall.
Of course, the government cannot admit this. Sterling's violent lurch down
to DM2.37 at one stage yesterday underlines how quickly such a policy could
get out of hand. But a lower exchange rate would help exports, which would
be useful given the balance of payments constraint to consumer-led growth.
As long as there is no visible inflation threat, which might force another
U-turn, the government has no immediate reason to talk the exchange rate
back up. The debate over spending cuts remains theoretical for financial
markets. Actual measures to deal with the budget deficit are probably still
some way off. The problem will have to be addressed eventually, though, if
Mr Major wants the UK to avoid Sweden's humiliation of being downgraded by
Moody's credit rating agency.

FT  09 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rather like Mr Norman Lamont, Eurotunnel's Sir Alastair Morton must be
wearying of huge borrowing requirements, fierce political skirmishes and
staring down long dark holes. But Sir Alastair can at least see some light
at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday's encouraging - if tentative - news of
progress towards resolution of its dispute with its contractors lifted
Eurotunnel's shares by almost 3 per cent. The sterling units have risen
nearly 50 per cent since mid-December. Although aided by currency movements,
the rise appears to reflect a shift in investor perceptions. Eurotunnel has
begun its evolution from unpredictable construction project to more
dependable transport utility.
Assuming the bitter wrangle with contractors can be resolved satisfactorily,
Eurotunnel should be able to complete the project within the year. TV shots
of trains carrying beaming passengers will help sentiment, if the opening
itself does little to alleviate the project's pressing financial needs.
Eurotunnel will probably still require more equity, but the pressure is
easing. With about 70 per cent of its debt at floating rates, Eurotunnel
will benefit if interest rates remain low in the UK and start falling in
France.
Once construction and refinancing are complete, investors should be able to
look forward to a predictable income stream. But everything depends on
traffic volumes. It is not yet clear what sort of price war rival operators
have in mind. The UK government has yet to agree on a high-speed rail link
to London and dividends are many years away.

FT  09 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Royal Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Bank of Scotland has not made it easy for investors to assess the
price it has obtained for its Charterhouse subsidiary. The headline tag of
Pounds 235m is flattered by the inclusion of the special Pounds 50m dividend
paid by Charterhouse last year. But the bank is retaining a 10 per cent
stake in Charterhouse, not to mention its entire capital market business,
which contributed almost half last year's pre-tax profits, as well as some
other assets. Had Royal been proud of the price, it would doubtless have
been at pains to trumpet the fact.
Charterhouse was never likely to fetch a large premium over book value given
its large development capital portfolio. But that only makes Royal's
determination to sell at this stage in the cycle more perplexing. The
official explanation is that Charterhouse is now free to expand in Europe.
But there was nothing in theory to stop that happening under Royal's
ownership, except perhaps that Mr Victor Blank, who heads Charterhouse,
could not persuade his Royal Bank colleagues to agree.
Instead Royal, which needs to improve its return on assets, has shed a
business capable of producing a healthy chunk of fee income. Nor does it
seem to have much idea what to do with the proceeds. A share price
outperformance against the sector of 11 per cent since December's annual
results suggests investors are mesmerised by the fast growing Direct Line
insurance business. But that should not mask lack of coherent strategy
elsewhere in the group.

FT  09 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Reward for Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Enterprise Oil's disposal of assets yesterday - like Lasmo's last week  -
suggests rumours of the North Sea's decline have been exaggerated. Both
companies realised a fair price from buyers anxious to gain a toe-hold in
the region. Yet a broader recovery in asset prices looks too much to hope
for. Established operators are already sinking cash into existing North Sea
projects and more inclined to buy elsewhere. Low dollar borrowing costs must
be tempting for opportunistic buyers, but without a revival in the oil price
serious buyers will remain few and far between. Enterprise was right to take
what was on offer.
The Scott and Nelson fields should secure growth up to 1996, but Enterprise
needs oil reserves for the second half of the decade. The cash raised
yesterday - and the proceeds of last year's preference share issues - should
allow it to acquire them. Unlike Lasmo, the balance sheet is hardly
stretched. With Scott and Nelson starting to generate cash later this year,
gearing of 45 per cent could quickly be reduced. It remains to be seen,
though, whether Enterprise can pick the right move. With the shares trading
at a healthy premium to net assets - in contrast with the majority of its
peers - the market is demanding nothing less.
By buying outside the North Sea, Enterprise could also diversify its
development portfolio. But any acquisition will be based on an assumption
about future oil prices and, therefore, carry a commodity risk. There is a
rare consensus in the industry about the prospects for the oil price, namely
that it will remain depressed. That should make it easier to strike a deal.
But it by no means removes the risk of over-paying.

FT  09 FEB 93 / VW to cut 36,000 jobs worldwide in five-year programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's leading carmaker, said yesterday that it plans to cut
its worldwide workforce by 36,000 by the end of 1997, reducing the current
figure of 276,000 by 13 per cent.
The cuts are a response to sharply deteriorating markets in Germany and
Europe as a whole. In broad terms, the cuts had been expected for some time,
although their scale is larger than expected. Previous estimates centred on
a loss of 30,000 jobs.
VW is believed to have been planning the cuts since the beginning of the
year when Mr Ferdinand Piech, previously head of its Audi luxury cars
division, took over as the group's chief executive.
It is thought the group has made an operating loss of DM1bn (Pounds 420m) in
its core VW division last year and its efficiency, measured in terms of
sales per employee, is poor compared with other carmakers.
The plan is believed to have been drawn up as part of a five-year strategy
agreed by the group's supervisory board early last month, but details have
never formally been released.
VW hopes to achieve the cuts without compulsory redundancies by means of
early retirement schemes and natural wastage.
The company insisted yesterday that the figure represented only a
'guideline, not a target', drawn up on the assumption that the German car
market would shrink by 20 per cent during the current year and the European
market by 10 per cent.
If conditions turned out better than expected, the figure would be revised,
VW said. It did not indicate how much money the group planned to save.
Of the total, 21,000 jobs will be shed in Germany and 15,000 elsewhere.
Around 5,000 will go at Seat, the group's Spanish subsidiary. Its Audi and
Skoda divisions will lose 8,000 jobs between them, although the majority
will fall at Audi rather than at Skoda, the group's Czech subsidiary.
The overseas division includes operations in the US, Mexico, Canada, South
Africa and Japan. It is also responsible for VW's 51 per cent stake in
Autolatina, the Argentine and Brazilian operations.
The German motor industry faces major restructuring; Mr Louis R. Hughes, a
former head of Opel, the General Motors subsidiary, has recently predicted
the industry workforce would be cut by half in the next few years.
The car industry has been one of the hardest hit of all sectors of the
German economy during the current downturn.
Companies are suffering a sharp fall in sales after two record years
following German reunification, their problems exacerbated by the
appreciation of the D-Mark in recent months. There is also increased
competition from Japanese carmakers within Europe.
With the exception of VW, almost all manufacturers announced their first job
cuts a year ago.

FT  09 FEB 93 / Ward note 'bogus', court told: Guinness adviser is
challenged over Pounds 3m bank deposit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR THOMAS WARD, the US lawyer charged in the final Guinness trial with
stealing Pounds 5.2m from the drinks company, was yesterday accused of
fabricating evidence to mislead the Old Bailey jury.
Mr Ward, who advised Guinness on its 1986 takeover of Distillers, finished
giving evidence last week.
However, he was recalled to the witness box yesterday to face further
cross-examination over a note he had written concerning the Pounds 3m he had
deposited in the Swiss bank account of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former
Guinness chief executive. The prosecution claims that the money was Mr
Saunders' share of the Pounds 5.2m allegedly stolen from the company after
the takeover bid succeeded.
Mr Ward, who denies the theft charge, had originally told the court that the
note - seen for the first time last week - was the only contemporaneous
evidence supporting his claim that the Pounds 3m was his and that he had
borrowed Mr Saunders' account to put the money aside to pay his tax bills.
However, Mr Victor Temple, prosecuting, told the court that documentary
evidence showed Mr Ward could not have written the note in August 1986 as he
claimed. He accused Mr Ward: 'This is a bogus document produced by you to
mislead, amongst others, this court and the jury.' Mr Ward replied: 'You
know that is not true.'
In the note to his brother Robert, the executor of his will, Mr Ward wrote
that the Pounds 3m in Mr Saunders' account belonged to him and that, in the
event of Mr Ward's death, his brother should contact Mr Saunders to get the
funds released.
The note - dated August 20 1986 - also gave details of other bank accounts
in which Mr Ward had an interest. These included an account with the
National Bank of Washington.
However, documentary evidence from the bank showed this account had not been
opened and its account number issued until December 11 that year, almost
four months later, Mr Temple said.
Denying the note he produced to the court was bogus, Mr Ward said: 'I am
well used to your scurrilous suggestions. I don't over-react to them, but
once again you are wrong.'
Later, Mr Robert Glass, a security officer with Riggs National Bank, which
took over the National Bank of Washington in 1990, confirmed that the bank's
records showed the account did not exist before December 11 1986.
The trial continues today.

FT  09 FEB 93 / British Gas to freeze prices for 18m users
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS will freeze prices to its 18m domestic customers and small
businesses on April 1, even though the company says the complex formula that
governs household prices gives it room for an increase in line with
inflation.
The company said it wanted a clearer view of the outlook for inflation and
other factors before deciding any price move. This means the freeze may not
be in place for a full year and prices could change if inflation rises or
gas costs increase.
The freeze follows price cuts of 3 per cent in July last year and a further
2 per cent in October after Ofgas, the industry regulator, put pressure on
British Gas to lower prices rather than freeze them as the company wanted.
British Gas's latest announcement came the day before the Ofgas annual
report in which Sir James McKinnon, the regulator's director-general, is
expected to champion the price cuts he forced on the company last year amid
constant attrition between the two sides. 'It is appropriate for British Gas
to buy the lowest cost gas it can and if it can keep its prices down it
should,' Sir James said yesterday.
British Gas estimates that the average household consumer pays about Pounds
500 a year to provide heating, hot water and gas for cooking for a family of
four. Prices have fallen 20 per cent in real terms since 1986.
Gas prices are dictated by a tough but complicated formula, the main part of
which limits price increases to 5 percentage points below the rate of
inflation.
But British Gas says that this year, the gas cost index - another element in
the formula which is based on retail price inflation, coal, oil, and
electricity prices as well as the cost of gas to British Gas - shows it
could raise prices.
Sir James said he would be looking very carefully at the gas cost index. He
said the turbulence of sterling against currencies such as the dollar and

FT  09 FEB 93 / GM alleges defamation by NBC in film of truck crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS, facing accusations that it sold millions of pick-up trucks
with faulty fuel tanks, hit back hard yesterday, defending the design of the
vehicle and launching a defamation suit against NBC television.
GM alleged that NBC's Dateline current affairs programme had broadcast film
of a test crash of a GM pick-up, showing the vehicle bursting into flames,
which had been rigged to give a 'grossly unfair and inaccurate' impression
of the vehicle's safety.
GM argued that this was part of an orchestrated campaign by lawyers who
represent plaintiffs in product liability cases, and others, to create a
'poisoned climate' about the vehicles.
The company's defamation suit - thought to be the first in GM's history -
came four days after a jury in Atlanta, Georgia, found GM was negligent in
the design of the pick-up trucks and awarded Dollars 105.2m (Pounds 69.6m)
to the parents of a boy who died in a fiery crash at the wheel of the
vehicle.
Separately, federal regulators have launched an inquiry into the safety of
the vehicles. They have the power to order a recall of the estimated 4.7m
trucks on the road, which would be extremely costly for GM at time when the
company is already financially stretched.
The controversy centres on the fuel tank of the C/K pick-up truck, which in
models built between 1973 and 1987 was located on the side of the vehicle,
outside its main frame. Critics claim this makes the pick-up vulnerable to
fire when hit on the side by another vehicle.
GM yesterday produced statistics from crashes in six states which it claimed
showed its pick-ups were no more vulnerable to fire than those manufactured
by US rivals Ford and Chrysler, and that for all three the incidence of
post-collision fires was low. The company held a lengthy news conference to
reconstruct and denounce the NBC test. It said the TV company had failed to
inform viewers that remote-controlled explosive devices were used to create
a fire source during the test crash.
It also argued the fire was probably fed by petrol spilling from an
over-full fuel tank, with a badly-fitting non-standard cap, and not from a
tank rupture.
NBC said yesterday the programme was factual and accurate, though it would
be broadcasting another this week telling viewers of the presence of
'sparking devices' during the test.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Leaden results in a golden age: American Express is at a
loss to explain the red ink at its Shearson Lehman brokerage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the challenges facing the new leadership of American Express, the
troubled travel and financial services group, few are as serious as the red
ink at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the group's brokerage and investment
banking subsidiary. Last month Shearson, the second biggest stockbroker in
the US, disclosed a loss of Dollars 116m (Pounds 77m) for 1992 and said its
brokerage commission income rose by a paltry 1.8 per cent during the whole
year.
By contrast, Merrill Lynch, the market leader, last year enjoyed net profits
that were 37 per cent higher at Dollars 952.4m and brokerage commission
income that rose by 12.3 per cent. PaineWebber, ranked third, reported 41
per cent better net earnings of Dollars 213.2m and brokerage commission
income that improved by 14 per cent.
Last week, as the dust began to settle on the boardroom battle at American
Express which led to the resignation of Mr James Robinson as chairman,
analysts were still puzzling over the reasons behind Shearson's losses in
1992, a year that saw some of the fattest earnings in securities industry
history.
There was also confusion about the leadership of Shearson. The question
arose because Mr Robinson had been named chairman and chief executive of
Shearson just four days before he severed all ties to the American Express
group. In winning those positions Mr Robinson had elbowed aside Mr Howard
Clark as Shearson chief, relegating him to vice-chairman. The firm is now
being run on an interim basis by Mr Richard Fuld and Mr Tom Hill, the
Lehman-side executives who were recently named co-presidents.
On Wall Street a surprising number of analysts who follow American Express
and Shearson said they did not have enough information to understand the
underlying reasons for Shearson's malaise.
Shearson has put up the barricades. Journalists and analysts are being given
few details. Mr Michael Egizio, a financial services analyst at Duff &amp;
Phelps, the credit rating agency, said that because he had been denied
access, he could not really know what was wrong with the firm. 'The company
doesn't seem to know either - that's what's so disturbing,' he said.
At first glance Shearson's fourth quarter 1992 net loss of Dollars 166m and
full-year deficit of Dollars 116m can be explained by a variety of special
charges.
These charges include a Dollars 150m after-tax write-off relating to loans
and equity held by Shearson in Computervision, a company that has had
trouble for the past two years in servicing a 1990 bridge loan that was to
have been refinanced by junk bonds. Also included is a Dollars 107m
write-down of property holdings and Dollars 59m in unspecified legal
provisions.
But in the fourth quarter of 1992 Shearson still only made Dollars 4m of
operating income before special charges. Mr John Keefe, an independent
financial service analyst at Keefe Worldwide Services, said it was odd that
'if you take away these unusual items it is still hard to find much
operating income - and this is during a golden age for the securities
industry.'
One man who should be in a position to explain the performance is Mr Harvey
Golub, who replaced Mr Robinson as American Express's chief executive and
who is now working on plans to restaff Shearson and return it to
profitability. But in his first press conference since Mr Robinson resigned,
Mr Golub and Mr Richard Furlaud, the new non-executive chairman of American
Express, spent more time defending their earlier support for Mr Robinson
than discussing future strategy.
When asked why Shearson made no money in 1992 Mr Golub spoke of the charges
as 'structural and baggage issues' and admitted that the security firm's
cost base remained too high. When asked specifically why the second biggest
brokerage house in the US had essentially flat brokerage commissions in
1992, Mr Golub replied: 'The answer is that I don't know.'
Mr Golub's aides eventually claimed the commissions had been flat because
gains in retail and institutional sales had been offset by declining
commodity commissions. They also blamed a shift in the reporting of
individual managed investor accounts from the brokerage commission to the
custodial and advisory income category. Shearson declined, however, to
provide a financial breakdown.
Mr Golub was equally reticent about the possibility of American Express
deciding to sell Shearson, saying at first he didn't know and then
correcting this to a 'no comment'. Mr Golub said only that Mr Clark would
not be reinstated as chairman and that there was 'no timetable' for
selecting a new chief executive. 'It certainly would be useful to have a CEO
at Shearson,' Mr Golub said.
In fairness, Mr Golub is neither an investment banker nor an expert in the
brokerage industry. He is something of a technician whose main task in life
has been to turn around the travel related services (TRS) division of
American Express. Mr Furlaud said that TRS would remain a prime
responsibility for Mr Golub.
Mr Golub pledged also to spend time on Shearson, which until recently seemed
to have recovered from its worst period two years ago when it suffered huge
losses and saw Mr Peter Cohen, chairman, forced out by Mr Robinson.
Some former Shearson executives blamed excessive compensation and overhead
costs for the firm's problems. Over the past two years Mr Robinson took a
personal hand in plotting Shearson strategy, apparently allowing costly and
overlapping expenses to occur when he came up with the idea of dividing
Shearson and Lehman into separate brokerage and investment banking arms of
the group. The unhappy marriage between the blue-bloods of Lehman Brothers
and the retail brokers of Shearson continues to create tension within the
firm.
The single biggest component of a brokerage firm's costs is employee
compensation - salaries and bonuses. At Shearson, compensation expenses have
grown faster than revenues. Last year, for example, the firm's compensation
expenses grew 14 per cent, while net revenues rose only 11 per cent.
These expenses, by some estimates up to Dollars 250m too high on an annual
basis, may explain part of the reason why Shearson, which analysts say
should have earned as much as Dollars 700m in full-year operating income
last year, only made Dollars 204m before charges, less than half the 1991
level.
Many on Wall Street are betting that American Express will move to cut
costs, strengthen capital and ready Shearson for an eventual sale - as part
of the group's gradual dismantling of Mr Robinson's 1980s strategy of trying
to build American Express into a 'financial supermarket'. Whatever happens,
it is clear that Shearson will remain an albatross for Messrs Furlaud and
Golub for some time to come.

FT  08 FEB 93 / European group may seek radio licence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLT, the Luxembourg-based international broadcasting group, has renewed its
interest in investing in UK radio and television, and is examining the
London commercial radio frequencies to be advertised next month.
Mr Gaston Thorn, president of CLT and former president of the European
Commission, was in London last week to express his interest to Lord
Chalfont, chairman of the Radio Authority, which regulates commercial radio.
The frequencies to be advertised include those used by LBC, Melody, Jazz and
Spectrum radios.
CLT is interested in setting up a music-based station in the south of
England and would like to repeat the success of its Atlantic 252, which
broadcasts mainly to the north and Midlands. Atlantic broadcasts pop music
and has a weekly audience of 4.25m adults, according to Radio Joint Audience
Research.
It is unlikely that CLT would be granted a London licence to broadcast just
pop music. The radio authority has a responsibility to broaden choice in the
area and Capital, whose licence will not be re-advertised until next year,
is a well-established pop station.
Mr Thorn says CLT is also interested in television. It would like to take a
minority stake in an ITV company, and then look at joint ventures in
continental Europe.

FT  08 FEB 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: In top gear and on course for a
listing - The turnround and proposed flotation of the David Brown Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (Published 9th February 1993) appended to this article.
IT TOOK more than a coat of fresh paint to change the face of David Brown
Corporation, a famous British gear manufacturer which had fallen on hard
times after 130 years of family ownership.
'Some of the workshops looked like the Black Hole of Calcutta,' said Mr
Chris Cook, 43, who three years ago became joint managing director with Mr
Chris Brown, 39, through a Pounds 46m management buy-in.
The new managers lost no time in ordering the redecoration of the group's
sprawling 16-acre site at Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, believing that
refurbishment would send a positive message to both employees and customers.
The clean-up also extended to the finances of the company, which is soon to
be floated as the David Brown Group, with an estimated market value of more
than Pounds 70m. In spite of recession, small losses at the time of the
buy-in have been turned into a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.3m last year on
turnover of Pounds 80m.
Strong cashflow has enabled the two former FKI executives to repay a Pounds
16m loan five years ahead of schedule, invest Pounds 10m on capital
expenditure over the past three years and spend Pounds 3.5m on acquiring new
businesses.
The change in the company's fortunes has not been painless. Some 300 people
were made redundant after the buy-in, and another 100 have gone because of
the recession. A further 100 went with the closure of three peripheral
businesses. Even after the acquisitions, the group's workforce has shrunk
from more than 1,800 to about 1,350.
In spite having a strike each year since they arrived, the new management
team said the workforce had responded very positively to changes - in
particular a move to manufacturing on a 'cell' basis, with operators
watching several machines and teams taking more responsibility for
organisation and quality of their output.
Although much of David Brown's equipment is old, new computer-controlled
machines have been bought which do the work of six of those they replace and
offer even higher accuracy.
The group now comprises four core divisions:
Vehicle transmissions, based in Huddersfield, supplies the Challenger tanks,
Intercity's 140mph Class 91 trains and most Formula 1 cars;
Special products, also based in Huddersfield, makes gears up to six metres
in diameter for industrial and marine applications;
Radicon, with factories in Sunderland and Huddersfield, makes standard
geared drives for a wide range of industrial applications;
Pumps, based at Penistone, near Sheffield, makes pumps and pumping systems
for the oil and petrochemical businesses.
Although the four divisions existed before the new team arrived, the group
was still highly centralised, with head office taking responsibility for
payrolls, cash-handling and invoices. Each division now has its own managing
director and finance director, and is fully responsible for its own
finances.
Head office staff has been cut from 40 to seven - including the two chief
executives and a secretary - who occupy a corner of a huge office suite
above the Huddersfield workshops. Three of the four divisional managing
directors came from within David Brown, but 20 managers have been recruited
to provide 'reinforcements' further down the organisation.
The new management found that although David Brown's reputation for
technical excellence remained high, it had acquired a poor name on delivery
dates, with many customers being given the impression that production was
geared to the convenience of David Brown, and not them.
Mr Cook said: 'There was a low-performance culture. People were set very low
targets and - not surprisingly - business did not perform well. They are now
set 'stretch' targets, which are tough but realistic'.
There has been marked progress. Supply times for geared motors has been cut
from 12 weeks to 2 days, or a week for less standard options. The group is
now beginning to win orders on the basis of its speedy supply dates.
In many ways David Brown embodies the history of British engineering. An
early technical lead in gears was transformed, along with empire, into a
huge industrial combine, which included tractors, Aston Martin cars, and the
Vosper Thornycroft shipyard.
Much of the grand heritage has gone, but the group retains another typical
legacy: strong ties to Commonwealth markets, but a negligible presence in
continental Europe and too small a share of the US market.
Gearing was 300 per cent at the time of the buy-in, but was rapidly reduced
and the group will have only modest borrowings after the flotation. The new
team is interested in making an acquisition in continental Europe and would
also be interested in acquiring a business doing repairs and maintenance for
the US petrochemical market.
The flotation is being sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, with de Zoete
and Bevan brokers to the issue. The buy-in was supported by Bankers Trust,
Charterhouse and Morgan Grenfell. The new management will have 20 per cent
of the group, post-flotation.
Mr Cook and Mr Brown scarcely knew each other while with FKI, but enjoy
their shared roles of joint managing director and intend to continue the
arrangement, although each does take specific responsibility for two
divisions.
Mr Brown said: 'We do get asked to do talks and presentations together,
which can be tricky. It's important not to come across like Morecambe and
Wise, but we are getting better at it.'
Last year the group appointed as non-executive chairman Mr Derek Kingsbury,
not least because of his experience in bringing the specialist engineering
group Fairey to the market in 1988.
In spite of the speed with which David Brown has been turned around, the
team is keen to dispel any impression of complacency. Mr Cook said: 'We know
we've still got a way to go.'
CORRECTION
David Brown Group, the gear and pump maker which is shortly to be floated,
had one strike in 1991, a year after the group's new management team
arrived. The phrase 'a strike each year since they arrived' in yesterday's
FT was the result of an editing error.

FT  08 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Kingfisher bid terms due shortly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERGER talks announced last Thursday between Kingfisher, the UK retailer,
and Darty, the French electrical goods chain, are continuing and terms of
the deal are expected to be announced within the next few weeks.
Analysts expect Kingfisher to offer a mixture of cash and shares to value
Darty at about Pounds 1bn. Kingfisher is likely to pay FFr1.6bn in cash, as
well as assuming about Pounds 500m of the French company's debt. Darty would
be left with about 12 per cent of Kingfisher's shares, according to French
press reports over the weekend.
Analysts have also reduced their estimates for the size of a Kingfisher
rights issue needed to help finance the deal. Kingfisher's shares fell 31p
to 527p last week on fears the company would need to raise about Pounds
800m. Analysts now say the rights issue may be less than half that amount.
Kingfisher has refused to comment on the terms of the deal.
Kingfisher owns the Woolworth and Superdrug chains as well as Comet,
Britain's second largest electrical retailer.

The bypass forms part of the new A564 Stoke-Derby link road, a key sector of
the new route between the M1 and M6 motorways in the Midlands. The new
bypass will run from the eastern end of the existing Sudbury bypass to join
the A516 east of Hilton.
A 3.5km trial length of the road will be of continually reinforced concrete
pavement, with an exposed aggregate finish. This form of concrete surfacing
is being used for the first time in the UK.
The contract includes five overbridges, three underbridges, side and slip
roads and flood relief culverts.

FT  08 FEB 93 / People: Pastures new for Quest-Ritson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Charles Quest-Ritson, a solicitor whose private passion for gardens recently
found expression in a highly-acclaimed book The English Country Garden
Abroad, has joined Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management to head up its
financial planning arm, Capel-Cure Myers Financial Services.
His move from a private law practice in the West Country to the private
client stockbroking and fund management group by way of two years at an
independent financial adviser, Advisory &amp; Brokerage Services, was occasioned
by a growing disenchantment with the legal world.
'The law is not changing very fast. When you reach a certain age and have
learnt the job, it is difficult to see where the challenge and excitement is
supposed to come from in doing the same thing for the next 20 years. The
courageous thing to do is to move on.'
The task at Capel-Cure Myers, where Quest-Ritson, 45, is in charge of a team
of eight, consists less in discussing specific investment vehicles with
clients than in developing an overall strategy for them. He regards it as
providing 'a brain-box that works on an individual's personal circumstances,
and touches on things that would normally be covered by accountants,
lawyers, tax experts and so on'.
Meanwhile, his latest literary success took two years to research and write
and grew out of a life-long love of gardening kindled at the age of nine
when he first collected the school gardening prize - a trophy he carried off
every subsequent term until he left.

Ian Grant, a non-executive director of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, has
joined the board of Banco Santander.
The decision to add a second Royal Bank director to Santander's board -
Royal Bank chairman Lord Younger has been a director for two years - follows
growing rumours that the Spanish bank was contemplating selling its 9.9 per
cent stake in the Scottish bank.
Santander used the occasion of Grant's appointment to its board last month
to reaffirm its commitment to the alliance with the Royal Bank which has a
1.5 per cent stake in Santander. A Santander spokesman described recent
stock market speculation that the links might be broken as 'complete
nonsense' and said that the cross shareholdings are 'long-term investments
which are central to the unique alliance of our institutions'.
However, one analyst noted that if the Royal Bank were really intent on
developing the relationship it should have put one of its executives on the
Santander board.
*****
Victor Beamish, formerly managing director of WI Carr (Far East), a
subsidiary of France's Banque Indosuez, has been appointed managing director
of HG Asia Securities in London.
For Beamish the move means re-joining a team he left in September 1987 when
HG Asia was part of the UK-based stockbroker Hoare Govett. HG Asia, though,
was bought out from Hoare's then American owner Security Pacific last June
and is now owned by its employees, Hong Kong holding company Guoco, and
American broker Smith Barney, which has 20 per cent.
Beamish, 39, a member of a distinguished Irish rugby-playing family who has
lived for spells in Hong Kong and Singapore, will be responsible for the
continued development of HK Asia's European, UK and North American business.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Management: Rebels turned diplomats / A look behind the
fanfare accompanying today'slaunch of a new-style Silicon Valley start-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE

<TEXT>
The ping-pong table and arcade-style video game at the centre of General
Magic's Silicon Valley offices are reminiscent of the early days at Apple
Computer, when Steve Jobs parked his motorbike in the lobby and the foyer
was furnished with games and a grand piano.
This young company, which has been a hot topic of computer industry rumour
ever since it was formed three years ago, will for the first time discuss
its technology today - software for 'personal communicators', pocket-sized
devices that will enable users to send and receive electronic messages.
So high are expectations for this fledgling that many in the industry
believe it has inherited the innovative spirit of Apple Computer, where
several of General Magic's managers played roles in the development of the
popular Macintosh personal computer.
Indeed, General Magic has much in common with the 1980s generation of
Silicon Valley entrepreneurial ventures that created the personal computer
and the software programs that have put computers on millions of desktops:
the casual style, the young engineers who seem to thrive on working all
night, and most importantly a passionate belief that this is a company that
is going to 'change the world'.
Yet General Magic is also strikingly different, notably because of the way
it is developing a network of partnerships.
Unlike the fiercely independent spin-offs of the 1970s and 1980s, General
Magic is built on alliances with some of the world's largest high-technology
manufacturers.
'Ten years ago, we were in our 20s, and the industry was very different. We
never gave a thought to co-operation. We were going to take over the world.
We felt so strongly that we were in control of our destiny,' recalls Joanna
Hoffman, now vice president of marketing at General Magic, who was a
principal member of Apple's Macintosh design team.
'Today, the industry is far more complex. There is a web of relationships in
which companies co-operate and compete at the same time,' she says.
General Magic's partners are Apple Computer, AT&amp;T and Motorola of the US,
Sony and Matsushita of Japan and Philips of the Netherlands. All are General
Magic investors, and all have licensed the company's technology for use in
their own future communications products and services.
Like most new ventures in Silicon Valley, General Magic is a spin-off. Its
genesis was in Apple's Advanced Technology Group, where Marc Porat, now
president and chief executive of General Magic, was attempting to develop
ideas for products 'beyond the personal computer'.
But in contrast to the legal recriminations that accompany the departure of
would-be entrepreneurs from many companies, General Magic's founders
received Apple's blessing and encouragement in the form of an equity
investment and technology licensing agreement.
From the beginning, General Magic set out to form alliances with 'world
standards setters', companies that could each bring a wealth of experience
to bear upon the challenge of creating a new industry. This common goal has
'transcended rivalries' among the partners, all of whom have invested in
General Magic in return for technology licences, says Hoffman.
'All of the partners are treated as equals,' she insists. That said, General
Magic remains coy about the size of its partners' investments and holdings
in the company except to say that all have
the same governance rights, with membership of the board of directors, and
all have reached identical technology licensing agreements with General
Magic.
Hoffman admits that maintaining such a complex set of relationships with
companies that have different cultures, and which in some cases are direct
competitors, has not been easy.
The original plan to invite alliance members to station their
representatives in General Magic's offices was scrapped when the company
found itself becoming 'an arena in which the contradictions of the
co-operative yet competing relationships among alliance members were played
out,' she says. 'We had to put a stop to it, and we did.' Visits by the
engineering teams from different partners now seldom overlap.
Certain areas of General Magic's offices were off limits to representatives
of the alliance partners so that they would not see each other's prototype
products. And General Magic's own employees, many of whom came from
environments in which sharing of information is encouraged, had to learn to
be more circumspect. In part this is a matter of tact, Hoffman explains. The
bigger issue is that alliance partners do not want each other to know
details of their product plans for General Magic software.
One of the most noticeable differences between General Magic and earlier
start-ups is its penchant for secrecy. Whereas most young companies,
especially those in the software industry, are all too eager to boast about
their products, even if they have yet to finish development, General Magic
has gone to the opposite extreme.
Although rumours have swirled around the company ever since it was formed,
General Magic has managed to keep the identities of some of its partners and
the details of its technology to itself. This is a remarkable feat in the
gossip mill of Silicon Valley.
'It also creates a mystique,' Porat acknowledges with a smile. Indeed, media
management seems to be one of the talents that General Magic has inherited
from Apple where the new company's founders also learnt that public
attention can be a distraction. 'We are preparing to do a lot of traffic
control,' in the wake of today's announcements, Porat adds.
The coyness, meanwhile, could not last indefinitely, as General Magic's
partners found it increasingly difficult to keep their involvement under
wraps and began to seek the involvement of third parties such as
applications software developers, Porat explains.
Porat is nevertheless anxious to limit expectations. General Magic has
refused to participate in the publicity created by others in the industry
who have promoted the potential of personal communications devices to create
a vast new industry.
'I am a walking antidote to hyperbole and hysteria,' says Porat. 'The public
is tired of promises that the high-tech industry does not live up to,' he
adds.
It may be a decade before General Magic's vision of intelligent personal
communications becomes reality, he stresses.
His colleagues who were involved in the development of Apple Macintosh
remember the bitter disappointment that they felt when the first version of
their product failed to live up to sales expectations. Ten years later, the
Macintosh is the core of Apple's business and their contributions to the
development of the personal computer industry have been widely acknowledged.
Such patience is also rare in a new venture. However, General Magic has the
unusual advantage of financial backers who are looking for long-term results
rather than a quick financial return. A potential problem is that this could
postpone opportunities for General Magic's employees to cash in their stock,
thereby putting a damper on the enthusiasm that drives the venture.
For the moment, General Magic is caught up in the excitement of its first
public performance. It is trying to create a brave new world in which
'personal communicators' are as ubiquitous as the telephone.
General Magic's ownership and management structure is certainly a formidable
challenge. But perhaps the biggest question mark is whether it can define a
new market.
The trick that the company has yet to perfect is to bring such technology to
the masses, 'those whose personal use of high-technology does not reach
beyond the car, the television set and the telephone,' as Porat puts it. 'We
want to make technology that people will welcome into their lives rather
than being a source of stress,' says Bill Atkinson, General Magic chairman
and co-founder.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMGEN'S share price plunged on Friday after the US biotechnology company
reported slowing sales growth for its pharmaceutical products and analysts
cut estimates for future earnings.
Net profit for the fourth quarter was Dollars 133.8m, or 91 cents per share.
However this included a one-time, pre-tax arbitration award of Dollars 77.1m
 -producing an after-tax gain of about 34 cents per share - over Amgen's
marketing rights dispute with Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare products
group.
In the same period last year the company reported net profits of Dollars
60m, or 41 cents a share. Fourth quarter sales rose to Dollars 308.2m from
Dollars 210m.
Sales in the quarter of Epogen, Amgen's anti-anaemia drug, were Dollars
135.7m, down slightly from Dollars 136.9m in the third quarter. For the
year, sales increased to Dollars 506.3m, from Dollars 409.4m in 1991. Sales
of Neupogen, which received US marketing approval in February 1991, rose to
Dollars 544.4m in 1992 from Dollars 232.8m in 1991,
Although fourth quarter earnings were in line with expectations, analysts
expressed concern that the sales momentum is slowing, and the company's
share price closed at Dollars 53 7/8 on Friday, down from Thursday's Dollars
59 3/4.
For the year ended December 31, total turnover was Dollars 1.1bn, compared
with Dollars 682m a year earlier. Net profits came to Dollars 357.6m, or
Dollars 2.43 a share, compared with Dollars 97.9m, or 67 cents, which
included a one-time, pre-tax legal assessment of Dollars 129.1m.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM'S parliament has approved wide-ranging reforms to transform the
country into a federal state and devolve more powers to its regions, writes
Andrew Hill in Brussels.
But the vote - a majority of only two - is unlikely to end the acrimonious
debate about whether constitutional reform heralds a split between
Flemish-speaking Flanders and francophone Wallonia. The vote rewrites the
first article of the constitution for the first time since Belgian
independence in 1830. Subject to approval in the upper parliamentary
chamber, it now reads: 'Belgium is a federal state.'
The package of reforms, many which still have to be approved, will devolve
responsibility for agriculture and foreign trade to the regions, which
include Brussels.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister and a Flemish Christian
Democrat, denied that a positive vote would precipitate the disintegration
of Belgium. 'I say clearly that this reform of the state does not lead to
separatism but is truly based on federalism,' he said.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Hong Kong attacks EC on dumping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A EUROPEAN Community investigation into alleged dumping by Hong Kong
computer disc makers cannot be substantiated, and should be terminated,
argues a Hong Kong government study submitted to the EC today.
The Hong Kong challenge comes at a time of mounting concern over a
'contagion' of dumping actions, as companies pressed by recession, and
lacking protection behind high tariff walls, see anti-dumping laws as
powerful weapons against foreign competitors.
Recent EC dumping actions against east European steel-makers, and US actions
against steel imports and threatened actions against vehicle imports, have
raised fears of international trade conflict.
The Hong Kong study challenges the dumping complaint, lodged four months ago
by the Committee of European Diskette Manufacturers (Diskma), saying the
calculations of supposed dumping are flawed; that there is no evidence that
European discs makers have been in any way injured by Hong Kong imports; and
that Diskma is not representative of European industry, accounting for 38
per cent of EC output.
The Diskma complaint was brought by Beltadisk and Computer Support, both
from Italy, Boeder of Germany, Rhone-Poulenc of France and Sentinel of
Belgium.
The Hong Kong report challenges the use of costs in Japan and China to
'construct' the costs of Hong Kong manufacturers. It says that, by using
these data but varying the selection, results could show anything from a
dumping margin of 86 per cent to overpricing of 30 per cent.
It complains that the investigation has had a 'severe harassment effect on
trade,' cutting exports which peaked at HKDollars 196m (Dollars 25.5m) in
1991 to about HKDollars 120m last year. In contrast, EC output of diskettes
has grown 11-fold, from 6.4m units in 1987 to 74.4m units in 1991.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREEK Cypriot voters gave Mr George Vassiliou, the incumbent, a commanding
lead of 7.5 percentage points in yesterday's first round of the Cyprus
presidential election.
Mr Vassiliou, an independent backed by the island's powerful Communist
party, did better than expected, winning 44.2 per cent of the vote to 36.7
per cent for his right-wing opponent, Mr Glascos Clerides.
Mr Paschalis Paschalides, a political newcomer supported by the centre-right
Diko party and the Socialists, finished a poor third with 18.6 per cent.
Mr Vassiliou is now favourite to win a second five-year term in next
Sunday's run-off ballot against Mr Clerides.
The vote is widely seen as a referendum on the latest United Nations
proposals for reuniting the Greek and Turkish communities on Cyprus. Mr
Vassiliou has played an active role in developing the UN 'set of ideas',
which proposes a settlement based on a federated state with Greek and
Turkish Cypriots living in separate zones.
Mr Vassiliou said the election results indicated that there was strong
Greek-Cypriot backing for his efforts 'to exploit the favourable
international climate, to increase the pressure on Turkey and to reach a
just and viable solution' of the Cyprus problem. The island has been
partitioned since 1974, when Turkish troops took over northern Cyprus in
response to an Athens-led coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece.
Mr Clerides is expected to seek an alliance with Diko ahead of the second
ballot, offering prominent centrists cabinet positions in return for their
party's support.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Joblessness rising in EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT has risen in most regions of Europe, but the most striking
increases have been in areas of Spain and southern England.
Eurostat, the European Community's statistical office, said rising
unemployment in Spain, Greece, Ireland and the UK were the main forces
behind the overall rise in EC unemployment.
The figures, which measure the increase in unemployment in the year to April
1992, take no account of the recent grave deterioration in employment levels
across the Community.
Unemployment in the EC rose from 8.5 per cent in April 1991 to 9.4 per cent
in April 1992. The areas worst affected were Campania, Basilicata and Sicily
in southern Italy and Andalucia, Extremadura, Ceuta y Melilla and the Canary
Islands in Spain. In these regions the jobless total was more than 20 per
cent.
It was below 5 per cent in southern Germany, parts of northern Italy -
Lombardia, Trentino-Alto Adige, Veneto and Emilia Romagna - and Portugal.
Luxembourg recorded the lowest rate of unemployment.
For the community as a whole, female unemployment rose by 11.5 per cent,
compared with 8 per cent for men. But female unemployment was lower than the
male rate in Hamburg, and every part of the UK other than the North of
Scotland.
Regional differences were most marked for the under-25s. In some regions of
Germany the rate was 2-3 per cent, while in many Spanish and Italian regions
it was over 30 per cent.
The figures came from the EC Labour Force Survey.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Life in the slow lane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's cut in German interest rates could turn out to be a lot more
significant than it looked, and in more ways than one. It is likely to lead,
sooner or later, to an intense debate on ways of strengthening the European
Community's exchange rate mechanism. This in turn will trigger a broader
debate over what is needed generally to strengthen the Maastricht treaty.
And this will set the stage for an agonising reappraisal in Britain over
whether it really wants to be in or out.
The question is, what is the significance of the German interest rate cut? A
week ago, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, was manifestly
opposed to any move. He publicly repudiated criticisms of his tight interest
rate policy, which he dismissed as coming from 'ignoramuses'. To cut
interest rates three days later suggests a striking change of course, if not
of heart.
Now there is nothing in the Maastricht treaty which requires a virtually
fixed currency grid well in advance of phase two next year. But the
political credibility of the system depends on the continued cohesion of the
central currencies in the system, starting with the French franc. In effect,
the ERM in its current configuration has come to be taken as a test of the
viability of monetary union; if the ERM is blown apart by the speculators,
the world will refuse to believe in the feasibility of Emu.
Moreover, the feasibility of monetary union is now turning into a test of
the credibility of the general political objectives of the Maastricht
treaty. A forced devaluation of the franc would represent a massive
political blow, both for the Franco-German relationship and for the general
objectives of European integration.
No one imagines that the Bundesbank wants to improve the plausibility of the
Emu programme; quite the reverse. But Mr Schlesinger does not have the power
to revoke the treaty of Maastricht, let alone to write off the political
capital invested, at least by the original member states, in the general
objectives of European integration.
Even if the Bundesbank has reluctantly accepted that it must do a tiny bit
more to underwrite the survival of the exchange rate mechanism, it cannot
guarantee unlimited support for the franc. On the other hand, the Bonn
government cannot contemplate the bald collapse of the system. Only two
politically acceptable options remain: if the speculators do not go away,
either the system must be strengthened so it is less vulnerable, or it must
be replaced by something else with equal political significance.
The French are already gearing up for a strengthening of the system; a
senior French official said last week the issues were now being discussed in
private, though there would be no overt initiatives until after the
ratification of Maastricht by Denmark and Britain.
Yet the general shape of French thinking is set out in a book* just
published by the planning ministry. The core countries, starting with France
and Germany, would speed their progress towards monetary union, through
intergovernmental agreements, and would irrevocably fix their parities next
January or soon after. The Germans would have to 'internationalise' their
monetary policy, and co-ordinate it with their part-ners; the French would
make the Bank of France independent.
Such a programme raises a raft of questions, both technical and political.
For example, how would the Germans 'internationalise' their monetary policy?
But the bottom line is that France and Germany have too much at stake to
accept a straight defeat at the hands of the speculators. If the Emu
programme cannot be salvaged in its present form, something of equivalent
political weight, in this or some other field, must be devised to keep up
the European impetus.
This broader debate, which cannot be eluded, will be deeply embarrassing for
Britain. The government has already said the pound will not rejoin the ERM
this year; it has indicated that the Bank of England will not be
independent; so it faces the prospect of being left in the slow lane of a
two-speed monetary Europe.
Some will argue that Britain is better off in the slow lane. It has broken
the chains of the ERM, it has cut inter-est rates, and can go for growth.
There is a political price, however. The other member states used to wink at
Britain's opt-out from Emu, believing Britain could never in practice afford
to stay out. Now they see the UK pursuing a policy of competitive
devaluation on a grand scale, in direct conflict with the spirit of the Emu
programme.
Moreover, some people in France now virtually accuse the UK (and the
Americans) of deliberately stimulating currency speculation, in order to
bust the ERM.
This may not be rational. But French insistence on the soundness of the
franc is not helped by an approximate 17 per cent effective sterling
devaluation. Even Chancellor Helmut Kohl alluded last week to 'those who
provoke disturbances so as to torpedo the process of monetary union'.
Once Maastricht is ratified, the treaty will be the subject of a new round
of debate and reappraisal, which is likely to be just as intense and
probably more serious than last year's. But the subject will be the
negotiation of a two-speed Europe, and this time the others will not be
sorry to see Britain stay in the slow lane.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Monday Interview: A change foreign to her nature - Cornelia
Schmalz-Jacobsen, head of Germany's foreigners' office, speaks to Judy
Dempsey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Somewhere among the many thousands of names at the Yad Vashem memorial in
Jerusalem, dedicated to both those who perished under, and who resisted, the
Nazis, are the parents of Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen.
'My parents did not belong to any resistance group as such. They simply knew
what was right. During the second world war, they kept their doors open all
the time in Berlin, where we lived. I will never forget it,' says
Schmalz-Jacobsen, former general secretary of the Free Democratic party, and
now head of Germany's awkwardly titled Federal Office for the Problems of
Foreigners.
'So many people from so many different backgrounds visited us in Berlin
during that time. It could have been dangerous. But my parents hid nothing
from me. They believed that a house with an open door was a sign of freedom.
My grandmother, a wonderful woman, who was Greek, thought the same. I
suppose I took our open door for granted.'
Now, more than 50 years later, Germany, which boasts the most liberal asylum
laws in Europe, is undergoing a fundamental rethink about restricting the
number of refugees who are flooding into the country following the collapse
of the Berlin wall in 1989.
Last year alone, more than 470,000 would-be asylum seekers sought refuge in
Germany. The influx of foreigners has fuelled calls from all sides of the
political spectrum - from the far right to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling
Christian Democratic Union party - to reform the asylum laws by tightening
up article 16 of the constitution, which allows everybody entering Germany
the right to refuge.
The number of foreigners entering the country has rekindled a mood of
xenophobia and provoked racist attacks. Despite belated attempts by the
government to clamp down on extreme right-wing groups, the Federal Crime
Bureau last week reported that in December alone, extremists had carried out
more than 1,000 attacks, including one fire bomb, 50 acts of arson, and 95
violent assaults on individuals.
But what haunts intellectuals, and the opposition Social Democratic party,
in the debate about amending the constitution is the memory of the past.
They argue that had other countries given refuge to Jews fleeing Nazi
Germany, many more could have been saved. Germany's open-door policy to
refugees since 1949 has been largely a response to the Jewish experience
during the war.
Yet Schmalz-Jacobsen believes that the emotional, and at times bitter,
arguments over the constitution are a distraction from the real problems
facing Germany: the absence of an immigration law. Because the country has
no immigration policy, everybody is allowed to enter. But those who manage
to remain in Germany do so overwhelmingly as foreigners - they have no easy
access to citizenship. Making citizenship easier, particularly for the
second generation of asylum-seekers, is Schmalz-Jacobsen's goal.
'The statistics speak for themselves,' she says, speaking from her
14th-floor office in Bonn. 'We have about 6.2m foreigners living in Germany.
Of that number 1.5m, or about 25 per cent, are under the age of 18.
Two-thirds of these 'children of foreigners' have been born here. Yet most
of them do not have German passports. These are the second generation of
Turkish immigrants, and those with other parents and grandparents who were
actually invited here by the German government to help rebuild the country's
shattered economy after the second world war.
'These children should be given the choice, as in France. There, children
have the automatic right to French citizenship, and then are given the
choice at the age of 18 to choose their nationality. In Germany, no such
thing exists.'
Schmalz-Jacobsen is just as critical of the difficulties facing those
foreigners who marry German citizens, and those who, having lived in Germany
for several years, are still deprived of easy access to a German passport. A
foreigner married for two full years can apply for citizenship after another
five. But a single foreigner has to wait 10 years before applying for
citizenship, and another five years before he or she is fully naturalised.
'Throughout this time, these people cannot vote, even though they pay taxes.
They have no rights. This has got to change,' she says.
Schmaltz-Jacobsen explains how the German law on citizenship is bound up
with the old imperial decree of 1913. Article 5.7 of the Reichs-und
Staatangehorigkeitsgesetz, or Imperial and State Citizenship Law, states
quite unambiguously: 'Through birth, one can acquire (German) citizenship if
the legitimate child has a German parent; and if an illegitimate child has a
German mother . . .' She adds: 'This means that the 6.2m foreigners in
Germany have little chance of obtaining German citizenship.'
How does this former journalist, and prominent FDP party member, explain the
government's retention of a law in which the blood-line dictates
citizenship? Schmalz-Jacobsen recalls an incident when she moved to Bavaria
where, between 1972 to 1985, she was a senior member of Munich's city
council.
'You tend to forget this but until 1967, there were still divisions between
Catholic and Protestant classes in the schools. One of my sons came home at
midday and asked me if I believed he had black spots on his soul. I
immediately thought that he might be ill. Then I realised that the school
was talking about the differences between the two religions. You are one or
the other. Germany's citizenship law is a bit like that. You have German
blood or you have not.'
Resistance to amending the law - even by allowing dual citizenship, a move
which Schmalz-Jacobsen is spearheading - comes from the Bavarian-based
Christian Social Union, the sister party of the Christian Democratic Union,
even though, ironically, Bavaria has one of the most liberal constitutions
of all the German states. CSU officials fear easier access to citizenship
would somehow dilute the German identity.
'This obsession with what makes up a real German is difficult to explain,'
says Schmalz-Jacobsen. 'Take my case. Now that I have this job, I have
become the subject of hatred. I get many hate letters. In the eyes of some
people who hate foreigners, I am a foreigner too because I want to help
them.
'I get threats as well.' She holds up a sheaf of letters. 'But then, I get
lots of letters from Germans who want to support me in my attempts to change
the law, and who want to integrate the foreigners living in our country.'
Yet, however much there is a gradual consensus emerging, at least among the
FDP and the Social Democratic party, Schmalz-Jacobsen wonders if the
government is really committed to policies which foster integration and
assimilation. 'When I first took this job in 1991, there was much resistance
to even talking about changing the law. It was 'No, no', all the time.
'The mood is changing. You just have to see the enormous groundswell of
opposition to racism. But then, you look at the budget with which we have to
work. I have a total annual budget of DM250,000 (Pounds 104,600); DM100,000
to do campaigning, press releases, and a small staff of 15, of which seven
are part-time. Sometimes I think the government is killing a good idea with
kindness.' It wants the office to exist, she says, but it is chronically
under-funded.
But then the indefatigable Schmalz-Jacobsen believes there are reasons to be
optimistic. 'It is always easier to go on living when you don't have to face
up to something which exists. We have a problem here. Slowly, the younger
generation of Germans are facing up to the need to assimilate and integrate
foreigners. We can't give up now.'

FT  08 FEB 93 / Greenspan eyes the Democrats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In his youth, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, was a
disciple of Ayn Rand, the ultra right-wing American novelist and philosopher
who stressed the moral, as opposed to economic, virtues of full-blown
capitalism.
According to Time magazine, in an article for Rand's journal the
Objectivist, Mr Greenspan once argued that the welfare state was 'nothing
more than a mechanism by which governments confiscate the wealth of the
productive members of society'. This was probably just youthful indiscretion
but Mr Greenspan is now having to adapt to an intellectual climate far
removed from Rand's social Darwinism.
This is not proving all that difficult. Mr Greenspan has always drawn a
sharp distinction between his private views and his duties as a public
servant. Although appointed to the Fed in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan,
he has never been publicly associated with radical conservatism. Having
served in the mid-1970s as chairman of Gerald Ford's Council of Economic
Advisers, he is seen as a moderate Republican. At the Fed he has built a
reputation for non-partisan professionalism; only the odd hint of his
personal philosophy emerges, as, for example, in his opposition to any form
of capital gains tax.
President Bill Clinton and Mr Greenspan are circling each other warily. Mr
Clinton has stressed his support for the Fed's independence; Mr Greenspan
has promised to co-operate with the White House and has publicly praised the
president's deficit-cutting plan. However, as one of the few remaining
conservatives with real power, Mr Greenspan has become a target for
congressional Democrats. In recent hearings, he was denounced for failing to
cut interest rates quickly enough during the recession and for refusing to
pledge further easing of monetary policy in response to fresh efforts to
curb the deficit.
At times, as senators adopted the sarcastic tone of prosecuting attorneys,
the hearings took on an almost surreal aspect. Oblivious to encouraging data
(such as growth at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter), Mr
Paul Sarbanes of Maryland acted as if the Fed chief were on trial for crimes
against the state. When Mr Greenspan had the temerity to defend his record,
the prosecutor reeled off the names of eminent economists - such as Nobel
prize-winners Milton Friedman, James Tobin and Paul Samuelson - who had
publicly criticised him for doing 'too little too late'.
The attack on Mr Greenspan's economic competence was wholly unjustified.
With hindsight he has navigated treacherous economic seas with great skill.
He courageously raised interest rates in the late 1980s, thereby setting in
motion disinflationary forces. But he was sensitive to the risk of a
1930s-style financial meltdown and subsequently brought rates down faster
than conventional wisdom abroad (although not at home) thought desirable,
thus laying the ground for a quite vigorous recovery.
Of course, Mr Greenspan's curriculum vitae does not compare with those of
armchair theorists such as Friedman, Tobin and Samuelson. He has published
little and was finally awarded a PhD by New York University only in 1977 -
after he had served three years as chief economist under President Ford.
Indeed, by the silly standards applied to Mr Clinton's appointees, Mr
Greenspan was not qualified to be CEA chairman. Instead of seeking a
university chair, young Mr Greenspan founded his own Wall Street consultancy
and spent decades analysing the minutia of business cycles, in the process
gaining more practical wisdom than half a dozen professors.
Having handled the recession adroitly, he now faces even tougher challenges.
With inflationary pressures still low and the economy only just beginning to
gather momentum, monetary policy is currently tight enough. But if Mr
Greenspan wants to be remembered as the first Fed chairman for a generation
to secure something approaching price stability, he may need to raise
short-term interest rates substantially in coming years, certainly by 1995.
The scene is thus set for a bitter tussle of power with the Clinton
administration, which is unlikely to be enthusiastic about a sharp
tightening of monetary policy ahead of the next election.
Yet there is a more insidious threat. Since the US has never suffered a
hyperinflation, there is little popular support for Fed independence. Some
of Democrats are pressing for legislation that would increase Congress's
leverage over monetary policy. Democrats have long been unhappy about the
role played by the presidents of the Fed's regional branches. Often
monetarist by inclination, the regional presidents have five of the 12 votes
on the Federal Open Market Committee (the body that determines the level of
short-term interest rates). Yet, unlike Washington-based Fed governors, they
are not selected by the White House or subject to congressional
confirmation.
Mr Clinton may mean what he says about Fed independence. But if the
electoral cycle proves more important, Mr Greenspan and his board (all
Reagan/Bush appointees) will face a painful dilemma. If the Fed resists
pressure for expansionary monetary policies, it may end up subject to
greater political control; if it does not, it risks higher inflation. It is
not an inspiring outlook for a man who prefers crunching data to playing
political poker.

FT  08 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Barclays launches new private service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS will today launch a new private banking service in Britain. The
move is the latest effort by one of the high street banks to raise levels of
income from less risky forms of business than personal or business lending.
The bank, which has previously carried out some private banking for British
residents through its international private bank, has established new
British business at the headquarters of Barclays Private Banking in London.
The move coincides with reorganisation of international and UK domestic
private banking services into a separate business within Barclays. The
business has 16 offices around the world, and handles Pounds 10bn of
clients' assets.
Ms Heather Maizels, director of UK private banking, said the bank would aim
to provide services to clients with at least Pounds 500,000 in assets, but
would seek to be more flexible in selecting clients than some other private
banks.
Barclays has integrated BZW Portfolio Management, the private banking arm of
its investment bank, into the new Barclays Private Banking business.
Mr Michael Tomalin, managing director of Barclays Private Banking, said that
clients wanted 'discretion and efficiency' from a private bank. Barclays was
in a position to offer a wide range of services because of its size.
Barclays is among British banks which have been searching for ways of
increasing operating income without heavy capital demands. Private banking
is attractive because most lending is well-secured, and income is generated
through services.
Shareholders of Barclays are being asked to vote for the bank to call an
extraordinary general meeting to discuss an 'agenda for recovery'.
The call was made yesterday by a shareholder group critical of Barclays in
an advertisement in the Independent on Sunday.
The group has asked shareholders to vote for a 'manifesto for the recovery
and prosperity of the bank' at an EGM.
The group is based at the same London address as the Safe pressure group
formed by dissatisfied small business customers of Barclays.

FT  08 FEB 93 / A potential world-beater: The US economy is emerging from a
protracted recession in leaner and fitter condition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is time to junk much conventional wisdom about the US economy.
Until recently, most analysts assumed the recovery from recession would
remain abnormally weak. And looking further ahead they assumed that the US
would continue to decline economically relative to other industrial
countries, principally Japan and a more unified European Community.
Both assumptions are now looking shaky. A clutch of much stronger than
expected data suggests the US recovery is finally beginning to take off. And
the economy that is emerging from recent structural upheavals is looking a
potential world-beater.
Output per hour increased 2.7 per cent last year - the fastest productivity
growth in 20 years. As Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told
Congress recently, the post-recession economy is a 'different animal':
policymakers have to come to terms with the implications of a 'dramatic'
improvement in productivity, especially in the sprawling service sector.
With productivity increases translating into impressive gains in corporate
profits, US share prices are hitting record highs and the dollar is
beginning to climb relative to other leading currencies. For internationally
mobile capital, the attractions of the US economy are enhanced by worse than
expected performance just about everywhere else. Growth throughout Europe is
being held back by the strains imposed by German unification and currency
instability. Japan, meanwhile, is struggling with its worst financial crisis
in decades.
President Bill Clinton shows few signs of appreciating his economic good
fortune. He is not only inheriting a lean, productive economy, he is
inheriting the most encouraging inflation outlook for a generation. Consumer
prices are expected to rise by only about 2.5 per cent-3.0 per cent this
year and next. And the figures could be even better if the 4 per cent
productivity growth rate of the fourth quarter of last year is sustained.
Mr Clinton, however, continues to talk as though the recession were barely
over and in his State of Union address on February 17 is expected to
announced an economic stimulus worth about Dollars 30bn, or 0.5 per cent of
gross domestic product. This is expected to be split roughly evenly between
immediate increases in federal spending, to take effect this fiscal year,
and an investment tax credit (plus other growth incentives) that would be
backdated to last December.
He will also announce longer-term plans to tackle what he regards as two
equally important deficits. The first is the familiar budget deficit, now
running at about Dollars 300bn but expected nearly to double within a decade
because of runaway growth of spending on healthcare and other 'entitlement'
programmes. The second is the 'investment deficit', a reference to
relatively low levels of public and private spending in areas such as
education, training and infrastucture.
As Mr Clinton works on his economic strategy, the signs of accelerating
growth are becoming too numerous to miss. Preliminary figures suggest real
GDP grew at an annual rate of 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter - the
fastest pace since the Reagan 'boom' of the 1980s and well above most
analysts' projections. It followed growth at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent
in the third quarter and constituted the seventh successive quarter of
growth since the official end of the recession in the spring of 1991.
A host of other data supports the GDP figures, which some now expect to be
revised up, rather than down. New orders for durable goods rose 9 per cent
between November and December, one of the biggest increases on record. The
index of leading indicators registered its biggest gain for nearly a decade
in December. The Purchasing Managers' Index - a reliable barometer of
conditions in manufacturing - surged to 58 per cent last month, its highest
level since the summer of 1988. Home sales soared at the end of last year,
reflecting the delayed impact of a sharp decline in interest rates.
The composition of the GDP figures, moreover, was unexpectedly encouraging.
Growth did not reflect temporary factors such as a rebuilding of corporate
inventories or a collapse in the personal savings rate. On the contrary it
mainly reflected robust growth of consumption - supported by unexpectedly
large increases in personal incomes. Corporate investment in plant and
equipment and residential construction surged, mainly as a result of lower
interest rates.
Mr Clinton is fretting, however, because the rate of job creation remains
disappointing. On Friday, the Labour Department reported an increase in
non-farm employment last month of slightly more than 100,000, about a third
to a half the increase expected in a 'normal' recovery.
Since the end of the recession, private-sector employment has been almost
static - a startling turnaround after the creation of 21m jobs in the Reagan
years. Public anxiety is being fuelled by a steady flow of job cuts at
leading blue chip companies such as computer maker IBM, retail group Sears
Roebuck, and car manufacturer General Motors.
But even the job outlook is not quite as bad as White House rhetoric would
suggest. Friday's employment figures showed that the proportion of different
industrial sectors hiring new workers has risen sharply in the past three
months. The unemployment rate fell to 7.1 per cent. That is still higher
than at the end of the recession and well above the 5.5 per cent 'natural
rate' - the rate reckoned to be consistent with non-accelerating inflation.
But it is sharply down from a peak of 7.7 per cent last June and far less
than European levels of about 10 per cent.
Officials are also worried that the recent upbeat numbers are overstating
the economy's likely growth this year. Early figures for January show few
signs of retrenchment: car dealerships and department stores are both
reporting strong sales. However, the fourth quarter figures were distorted,
for example by rebuilding after hurricane damage in Florida and by the
bringing forward of bonuses in the securities industry to avoid higher taxes
this year. Exports, resilient so far, could yet be hit hard by the sharp
slowdown in many overseas markets.
Nor can Mr Greenspan's famous 'headwinds' be forgotten. These structural
factors, including cuts in defence, still high levels of personal and
corporate indebtedness, glutted commercial real estate markets and
restraints on credit supply to small business, remain potential drags on
growth. The best that can be said is that a natural healing process seems
well advanced.
Having failed to predict two previous 'dips', the US forecasting fraternity
thus remains understandably cautious. The consensus view is that the
underlying growth rate is a solid 3 per cent, rather than the near 4 per
cent rate of late last year.
The big question is whether the US economy is experiencing more than a
cyclical rebound. With the defeat of the Republicans in the election, a
debate about the economy's underlying strength is getting under way. In this
year's Economic Report of the President, Mr Michael Boskin, chairman of
President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, dismissed 'declinist' fears
that the US is losing ground relative to other industrialised countries.
He claims that the US is more internationally competitive than it has been
in decades and that it accounts for a larger share of the industrial output
of the 24 rich members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development than it did in 1970. The share of US exports in GDP has risen
rapidly to about 11 per cent against 8 per cent in 1987, reflecting the
success of American companies in winning back market share overseas. Living
standards, measured properly to reflect differences in internal prices,
remain the highest in the world.
Mr Boskin is probably overstating his case: the revival of US exports, for
example, was helped enormously by the dollar's depreciation since 1985. But
something important did happen in the 1980s, partly as a result of an
overvalued dollar: US industry suddenly woke up to the reality of foreign
competition. Faced with higher quality, and usually cheaper, products from
Japan and Germany, it began a fundamental reappraisal of work practices and
business strategy.
The fruits were evident first in sharp gains in manufacturing productivity.
According to OECD figures, productivity in US manufacturing rose by about 55
per cent between 1980 and 1991, compared with gains of less than 40 per cent
in Germany and Japan. Manufacturers thus extended an already sizeable
productivity lead relative to their rivals.
But inefficiency in the US service sector (which was absorbing huge numbers
of baby boom workers) meant that overall productivity growth was only about
a third of the average 1.5 per cent annual pace in industrialised countries.
The importance of recent productivity numbers is that they suggest that the
US service sector - which accounts for three quarters of value added - is
now undergoing a restructuring akin to that of manufacturers in the 1980s.
In the fourth quarter of last year, overall productivity actually grew
slightly faster than manufacturing productivity, suggesting that service
companies were improving their efficiency even faster than manufacturers.
Productivity always rebounds after recessions, so it is too early to be
certain that a long-lasting transformation of services is under way. But it
is certainly consistent with other trends, such as a shake-out of white
collar jobs and heavy investment in computer technology.
The notion that US business in undergoing a renaissance of sorts is born out
in other ways. The quality of US cars, for example, is greatly improved.
Symbolically, the best-selling car last year was a Ford rather than a Honda.
And while IBM's problems are typical of those of aged 'national champions'
everywhere, all of the young companies competing for its mantle - Microsoft,
Intel and so forth - seem to be American. US capitalism has not lost its
capacity for innovation.
The Clinton administration still faces formidable problems. Ms Laura Tyson,
Mr Boskin's successor at the CEA, is justifiably concerned about the steady
rise in inequality in the past decade and the rising numbers of full-time
workers who cannot earn enough to keep their families above the official
poverty line (a yardstick based on the income required to buy food and other
essentials.)
The rise in inequality is real and it explains much popular discontent about
the economy. The gap in income and wealth between the top 20 per cent-30 per
cent of well-educated graduates and the rest of the population - Mr
Clinton's 'forgotten middle class' - seems to be growing relentlessly.
Ironically, it may be partly a consequence of the US's successful adaption
to the rigours of global competition.
Being internationally competitive means paying the going world rate for
different factors of production; the problem for many US workers is that the
going rate for low-skilled work is substantially less than what is required
for a comfortable US life-style. The answer, as President Clinton argues,
lies mainly in improving the education and training of workers at the bottom
of the pile - an important requirement in addressing the so-called
'investment deficit'.
The other, depressingly familiar problem is the federal government's
inability to balance its budgets. The latest projections suggest the deficit
will stabilise at about Dollars 300bn (or slightly less) in the next few
years and then rise steeply again.
In principle, this drain on private sector savings is easily stemmed: the
deficit could be eliminated entirely over four or five years without
imposing any measures that are not already commonplace in most other OECD
countries. The US simply has to choose from a menu of unplatable options
that includes: deeper cuts in defence spending, tougher controls on the
price and volume of medical services, higher taxes on federal pensions, and
a broad-based tax on energy or consumption, preferably both.
Mr Clinton's unofficial target is for annual budgetary savings of about
Dollars 145bn within four years. This would enable him to project a deficit
in his final budget of about Dollars 200bn. He is certain to raise the top
rate of income tax and to cut defence spending, but his resolve on more
controversial issues, such as a broad-based energy levy, has yet to be
demonstrated. But if he can convince the electorate that everybody
(especially the rich) is being asked to make a fair sacrifice, he may prove
a more effective budget-trimmer than sceptics fear.
The deficit will remain a headache. But it is not enough of a drag to abort
this private-sector led recovery. The productivity revival looks genuine and
offers a real chance of sustained non-inflationary growth. The irony is that
much of the credit should go to George Bush, who lost the election because
he followed a classic piece of economic advice and chose to sit there rather
than do something. The result was an agonisingly slow, but eventually solid,
recovery.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Italy reduces banks' reserve requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government has lowered the proportion of funds commercial banks
have to deposit with the Bank of Italy, to try to reduce the country's high
borrowing costs.
However, the decision to cut obligatory reserve requirements was greeted
cautiously by bankers at the weekend, amid warnings that interest rates
would not come down immediately.
The move lowers to an average 17.5 per cent from 22.5 per cent the
proportion of deposits and short-term certificates of deposit commercial
banks have to place with the central bank. The reserve requirement is one of
the highest in the western world, and has often been blamed for contributing
to Italy's high interest rates and low bank profits.
The move, long sought by bankers, follows last week's 0.5 percentage point
cut to 11.5 per cent in the Bank of Italy's discount rate, and is a further
response to growing recessionary pressures in the economy. As unemployment
rises, industrialists have been demanding lower interest rates to stop
output being stifled. The decision to cut reserve requirements, under
discussion for some time, follows a similar move by Germany last month.
The cut in the reserve requirement will create about L15,000bn (Pounds
6.7bn) in additional liquidity for commercial banks. A further L5,000bn
should be freed by mid-March as a result of a reduction to 10 per cent from
22.5 per cent in the proportion of funds which banks raise from certificates
of deposit of over 18 months' maturity and place with the Bank of Italy.
However, Mr Tancredi Bianchi, the chairman of the Italian Bankers'
Association, warned that no cut in lending rates would take place for some
weeks. Other bankers, who have cut lending rates by between 0.5 and 1 point
in response to the discount rate reduction, said their room for manoeuvre
was restricted by the falling growth rates for deposits and by the Bank of
Italy's decision to cut by half a point the interest rates its pays on the
reserve placed with it.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Aspin confirms commitment to Nato: Plans for US troop cuts
do not mean sidelining Europe, new defence secretary says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER and QUENTIN PEEL

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LES ASPIN, the new US secretary of defence, sought to reassure his allies
in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation at the weekend that the Clinton
administration's plans for troop cuts in Europe would not undermine its
commitment to the alliance.
'Our intention to reduce our presence in Europe by the mid-1990s reflects
the reduced threat environment in Europe, not any reduction in our
commitment to Europe,' he told senior government ministers, top diplomats
and military officers attending the annual Munich security conference.
The defence secretary is expected to receive a report in Washington today on
how the total US military strength can be reduced to 1.4m, instead of the
Bush administration's target of 1.6m over the next five years. The number of
troops in Europe is expected to be cut to a maximum of 100,000, instead of
120,000.
Mr Aspin was responding at the weekend to repeated urging by the European
allies, led by German chancellor Helmut Kohl, for the new US administration
to restate its security commitments, at a time of growing instability in
eastern Europe.
While he stopped short of spelling out any details of the administration's
foreign and security policy rethink, he insisted that his very presence in
Munich should 'demonstrate our determination to work with our European
allies to meet the challenges of the post-cold war era'.
Mr Kohl led the European chorus calling on the US to maintain its
commitments. 'It is imperative that the US, mindful of the lessons from
history this century, continues to play its central role in matters of
European security,' he said.
'It also requires that a substantial military presence should remain in
Europe in order to meet the alliance's tasks now and in the future.'
His words were immediately echoed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, who said: 'It would be deeply foolish to let or encourage the
Americans to go home, as foolish as it was in the 1920s when Adolf Hitler
was simply an insignificant adventurer in this city of Munich.'
The strains in the Nato alliance, and the anxious debate among the allies
over how to redefine its role, dominated the meeting.
Mr Kohl repeatedly stressed the dangers of instability in eastern Europe,
especially the former Soviet Union, requiring concerted action from all the
western allies to prevent new conflicts.
However, he underlined the budget pressures on member states when he
announced a new review of the troop strength of the German military, opening
the possibility that it could be reduced below the present target of
370,000.
There was clearly no consistent line on how to resolve the conflict in
former Yugoslavia, nor on how to redefine Nato's function to include
peace-keeping and peace-making outside the territory of its member states.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Madrid hints at fall in interest rates this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish government has hinted that official interest rates in the
country may fall in the next few days following the reduction in German
interest rates last week.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, said at the weekend that while it was
up to the Bank of Spain to decide whether to trim its official intervention
rate from 13.25 per cent this week, sharp falls in Spanish interbank rates
after the German cuts meant the market was already discounting a Spanish
cut.
The government, which in this election year is under pressure to stimulate
an economic recovery, would welcome any help from the Bank of Spain.
Mr Solchaga announced at the weekend that the economy had grown just 1.2 per
cent last year. The minister believes that, at best, gross domestic product
will grow 1 per cent in 1993.
Mr Solchaga said unemployment had risen from 16.3 per cent to 18.2 per cent
last year, badly missing the target contained in Spain's plan to converge
its economy with leading countries of the European Community. The plan had
aimed at GDP growth of 3 per cent for 1992.
Adding further evidence to fears that Spain may actually have entered a
recession in the last few months of 1992, Mr Solchaga said fixed capital
formation had fallen 2.7 per cent for the year, rather than rising 3.2 per
cent rise as initially forecast. Fixed capital formation fell rapidly in the
second half of 1992, by 4.1 per cent.
Despite triumphant sniping from political critics, however, the government
believes it has a real chance of ending this year with a recovery under way.
Economic stagnation and the early implementation of tax increases in 1992
should hold prices well in check this year, making significant interest rate
cuts possible.
The government has also taken some heart from figures showing it managed to
hold the general government deficit to 4.4 per cent of GDP last year.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (15): Problems for liberal hosts - Refugees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PARICHEHRE MOSTESHAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Afghan refugees have not exactly been queueing up to leave Iran despite
political improvements at home. Even rather obvious hints from Iranian
officials that the time has come to leave have fallen on deaf ears.
Last month Esmail Mufidi, Governor of Khorasan Province, which borders
Afghanistan, assured the 2.9m refugees that their return was essential to
the success of the Islamic Revolution in Afghanistan. The truth is that it
would not exactly damage the revolution on the Iranian side of the border,
either.
Iran's problems stem from its liberal treatment of those who take refuge
within its borders. There are no camps, just a handful of 'guest cities'
where refugees are invited, but not forced, to live. The 4m displaced people
in Iran are free to live and work anywhere except in regions suffering from
war damage and therefore unable to support an extra burden. However, they
still represent a considerable burden to their hosts.
Afghans make up the majority of the refugees. The 1.3m Iraqi Kurds and Shia
Moslems that poured across the border in the wake of the Gulf war have
mostly returned, but there is still a large Kurdish community who fled Iraq
during more than 20 years of repression.
The Islamic Republic has played host to numerous waves of displaced people
since the 1979 revolution. About 400,000 Iraqis were exiled to Iran exile in
the early days of the Iran-Iraq war and a further 100,000 followed after the
attacks on the Kurdish villages. More than 10,000 Kuwaitis also fled to Iran
after Saddam's invasion.
There are also relatively small numbers of people fleeing events in Sudan,
Sri Lanka, Egypt, Palestine and India.
'Nowhere else are refugees given such freedom. We wish more countries would
take the Iranian example and give an alternative to camps,' enthused an
American aid worker in Tehran for a conference on the refugee problem. Last
month, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) gave new assurances
that some 2m Afghans, now in Iran and Pakistan, would return home this year.
However, Tehran is becoming increasingly depressed about the level of
displaced peoples happy to shelter under the Iranian flag.
According to Mr Jean-Marie Fakhouri, UNHCR deputy for South Asia and North
Africa, about 1.3m Afghans returned to their homeland in 1992. But only an
estimated 300,000 were from Iran.
However, Mr Ahmad Hosseini, director-general of the Bureau for Aliens and
Foreign Immigrants' Affairs, says the Dollars 15m earmarked for Iran by the
UNHCR in 1992 fell drastically short of the expenditure on refugees. And he
said Iran had not received the Dollars 130 each Afghan refugee had been
promised by the UN to help them return.
Iran's greatest fear is that as the turmoil in the countries surrounding it
increases, it will be seen as a safe haven for all the displaced people of
the region.
Mr Hosseini argues that although 90 per cent of the Iraqi Kurds that took
refuge in Iran in the aftermath of the Gulf war have gone home, the
situation is still a cause for worry.
Saddam Hussein is still in charge in Iraq and his aggression against
minority Kurds and Shia Moslems could still send a new wave of refugees into
Iran.
To the north, the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has produced its
own displaced population. Takijistan is also in turmoil and the two peoples
share a common language and culture, making Iran the natural port of refuge.
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan sent 2.9m Afghans into Iran, but Tehran
has received less than any other host nation in international funding -
mainly given by the US and Japan - the bulk having gone to Pakistan.
Mr Hosseini says: 'The entire world should help us, we are taking care of
them (the refugees) on your behalf. If the developed world does not help
today, tomorrow the refugees will not be only in Iran and Pakistan, they
will gather on the borders of Europe.'
According to a report by the US Committee for Refugees to a US Senate
sub-committee on Refugee Affairs in 1991, 'For every dollar reportedly
allocated per Iraqi refugee in Iran, Dollars 7.60 has been spent for an
Iraqi refugee on the Turkish-Iraq border.'
There are 80 'guest cities', but less than 7 per cent of Afghans in Iran
live in these. The rest live in 24 provinces throughout Iran. But 55 per
cent have chosen to settle in Khorasan, Kerman, Sistan and Baluchestan. In
Khorasan they make up 23 per cent of the population. In some areas,
especially on the borders, the ratio of Iranians to refugees is one to one.
More than 33,000 have taken Iranian wives and become part of local families.
Most of these people have no one left in Afghanistan to return to.
Iran allows refugees to work in 16 occupations, but construction is the most
popular. There is no limit to the amount of money that they can send home.
With Afghanistan's future still uncertain, and the construction industry
still healthy in Iran, there are few incentives to return east. Some 61 per
cent of the Afghans were farmers, but in Iran a mere 8 per cent still work
on the land. They have created many problems for the host nation. Some 80
per cent of the refugees are aged less than 40 and the competition for jobs
is beginning to cause tension.
Since the fall of Kabul to the Mujahideen, some 176,000 Afghans have
returned home. According to Iranian officials, those who went home from Iran
have found that their countrymen who took shelter in Pakistan received
Dollars 130 to return, as well as blankets and food. Iran has not had the
funding from the UNHCR to allow her to do this. As the news filters back, it
becomes more attractive for the refugees to stay put.
The conclusions of the USCR report on the Iraqi crisis holds just as true
for others taking refuge in Iran: 'Iraqi refugees in Iran should not be
punished because they have fled to a nation isolated from the western world.
The aid is for the refugees, not for Iran.'

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (16): More smiles than scowls - Business
guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY first-time visitors to Iran are surprised. They arrive conditioned by
the particular type of publicity Iran has received over the past 15 years
and instead discover rather more smiles than scowls.
It has not always been like that and first impressions have been much
improved by the streamlined procedures at Tehran's Mehrabad airport.
Instead of the long waits, aggressive baggage searches and minute
examination of currency declarations, it should now be possible to get
through the airport at an internationally acceptable pace. There are now no
currency restrictions, arriving or leaving, and quite often no baggage
check.
On no account attempt to take alcohol into the country or publications with
immodest photographs of women. Video tapes may be confiscated.
HOTELS
The two most popular in Tehran are the Laleh (formerly the Intercontinental)
and the Esteghlal (formerly the Hilton). Both have seen better days, but the
Esteghlal has benefitted from restoration work. The Laleh is downtown and
can be more convenient for government ministries and embassies.
The Esteghlal enjoys the cleaner, cooler air of north Tehran and has superb
views over the mountains. But the drive into town can test the nerves of the
most hardened taxi passenger. At night it is not uncommon to find cars
without lights driving at more than 70 mph on the expressway.
Tehran hotels tend, fairly, not to boast about their cuisine, but it is
modestly priced. Caviar, when available, is particularly good value.
International phone calls suffer only slight delays and fax facilities are
available.
Hotels usually ask for the room rate to be paid in dollars but accept rials
for all other spending.
Other hotels: Azadi Grand (formerly the Hyatt) and the Homa (formerly
Sheraton)
CURRENCY
Credit and charge cards are not accepted in Iran. Take cash. The dollar,
sterling and the D-Mark are the most easily traded.
It is faster - and often slightly more profitable - to go to a money changer
rather than a bank. Be prepared to be given large quantities of
low-denomination notes.
TRANSPORT
Local representatives often provide a car and driver for visitors.
Otherwise, the car services operating from the main hotels have
English-speaking drivers, reasonably modern vehicles and charge by the hour
or by the day.
There is a good private hire company directly opposite the Laleh. In view of
the traffic problems of Tehran, it is vital to employ experienced drivers
who have a good knowledge of the city. A willingness to reverse at speed the
wrong way down one-way streets is a time-saving asset.
Iran Air runs frequent services between the biggest cities. Seats can be
difficult to acquire without booking well in advance.
VISAS
For a first-time visitor, the simplest method is to join a trade mission or
attend the annual international trade fair. Once contacts have been made
with local companies, it is then possible to be invited, the normal
procedure for getting a visa. It has be approved by the Foreign Ministry in
Tehran.
Allow several weeks and be sure to find out the approval number in order to
assist the local consulate which will actually be issuing the visa. It is
often possible to get visa extensions once in Iran.
EMBASSIES
Most western countries have embassies in Tehran. British representation has
been strengthened but there is still no ambassador because of the Salman
Rushdie affair. Commercial sections can offer guidance on changes in local
regulations and on key personnel in government departments.
LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES
Finding the right local representative can be the key to success in Iran.
Accurate, up-to-date information and guidance through the local bureaucracy
is at a premium.
Embassies can help in providing contacts, as can the local chamber of
commerce and in London, the Department of Trade and Industry.
DRESS
Many visiting businessmen choose to wear suits and ties, although it is not
necessary, especially when dealing with the government. Arms should be
covered in public.
Women must be fully covered, with a scarf over the hair. Cosmetics can be
used discreetly.
Iranian women constantly seek to push back the frontiers of the dress code.
Limits of official toleration are subject to sudden change.
SOCIAL ATTITUDES
Men must never offer to shake hands with a woman in public. In people's
homes, especially in affluent north Tehran, pre-revolutionary attitudes
prevail.
Alcohol is more prevalent than might be expected, but it is unwise for the
visitor to appear to be under its influence. Criticism of the regime is
often heard but best not repeated. Iranians remain strongly nationalistic.
Help with visas is often sought.
SHOPPING
The ban on carpet exports has been lifted and individuals can now take out
of the country one carpet and one kilim. Best to seek local advice and
bargain hard.
Caviar is best bought at the airport on departure. Beluga and sevruga are
usually available at about one-seventh of the London retail price. Payment
has to be made in rials but there is a bank near the caviar shop. Saffron is
also an excellent buy.
GUIDES TO IRAN
One of the best, quick guides is Doing Business with Iran written by Pauline
Jackson and published by the Committee for Middle East Trade, 33, Bury
Street, London SW1Y 6AX. This also contains sections on contracts,
tendering, bidding, contract negotiations, taxes and social security.
Business International has also published three other manuals on Iran by
Pauline Jackson: Iran: a Practical Handbook, Iran after Khomeini and in 1991
Iran - A Manual for Foreign Business.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (14): Restoring output to pre-war levels -
Oil and gas industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAN is on schedule to achieve its target of 4.5m barrels a day (b/d)
sustainable oil production by the end of March, according to Mr Gholamreza
Aghazadeh, the minister of oil. If achieved, it will represent a substantial
step in the five-year effort by Iran to repair its war-damaged oil
facilities, introduce new capacity and bring output closer to the 6m b/d
level achieved before the revolution.
'We do not look at reaching 4.5m b/d on a sustainable basis by next March as
expanding our output capacity. It is merely restoring our pre-war production
levels', said Mr Aghazadeh in a message aimed at the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries. 'Every month sees an increase in our
production capacity.'
Current efforts by members of Opec to agree production cuts in order to
support weakening crude prices will help to determine Iran's actual
production levels which the minister put at 3.8m b/d in November, 3.5m-3.6m
b/d in December and 'no more than 3.5m b/d in January'. Of those totals,
some 350,000 b/d is on average produced from Iran's offshore wells and the
remainder from onshore sources.
The return by Iran to oil production levels closer to those of 14 years ago
is just one part of a programme designed also to invest heavily in natural
gas, to expand refinery capacity and to improve the products distribution
network within the country.
The investment made already and that required for the next stages of the
programme is substantial and will have increasingly to involve foreign
companies, an issue of continuing sensitivity for the Iranian parliament.
Mr Aghazadeh stressed that so far the amount of foreign investment had been
relatively modest because the majority of the work had been carried out in
onshore areas. 'The only part which is very costly for us is the
reconstruction of the offshore facilities, because that is being carried out
by foreign contractors. In order to reach 4.5m b/d some Dollars 3.5bn has
been spent. But the remaining portion still to be spent is in rials.' He
added that negotiations were continuing with foreign companies over the
development of the Sirri and Balal oilfields in the Gulf and the North Pars
and South Pars gas fields.
'We have quite a few foreign companies that have presented their offers to
us for the development of those fields. We are now negotiating with them
over terms and I hope we will be able in the near future to conclude those
talks. The companies will get their return on investment through buy-back
arrangements', said Mr Aghazadeh.
He added that it was only to be expected that negotiations would be
protracted because of the limitations imposed by the Iranian constitution on
agreements with foreign companies. 'For instance, we will not accept any
production sharing and we will not grant any equity to foreign companies in
our oil fields', said Mr Aghazadeh. Even so, he believed that negotiations
would be completed shortly.
The requirement for investment from overseas is likely to be even greater
once Iran moves on to the next stage of development which will concentrate
on natural gas and refineries. Sums ranging up to Dollars 30bn over the next
two decades have been suggested as necessary if Iran is to carry out its
plans for meeting future additional domestic energy requirements with gas
rather than oil. Ideally it would like to hold domestic oil consumption to
about 1.3m b/d.
'We have prepared a study for the government on the outlook for natural gas
for the next 15 years. We looked at many questions, such as domestic demand,
volumes needed for gas injection programmes in the oilfields, and the actual
sources which would be developed,' said Mr Aghazadeh. 'In this context of
supply and demand, we estimate that we will have a surplus of some 50bn
cubic metres per year to be exported, which gives us a very bright future.'
Iran is involved in talks with Ukraine and a consortium of European
companies over ways of transporting the gas, either through a pipeline or in
a liquified form. Officials say the plan is for Iranian gas to be supplied
to Ukraine and then for the pipeline to be extended into eastern Europe. If
all went smoothly, Iran could envisage being able to export up to 50bn cu m
of gas a year soon after the turn of the century.
Even bigger question marks surround Iran's requirements for additional
refining capacity to meet domestic demand. Given the already long queue for
access to limited foreign currency earnings, Iran is probably going to have
to look to the private sector for funds. Interest has been expressed already
by the Bonyad Mostazafan religious foundation. However Mr Aghazadeh
dismisses the idea. 'As long as domestic fuel prices remain so low compared
to international prices there will not be any seriously interested party
from the private sector wanting to invest', he said. 'The economics for this
kind of operation is simply not favourable.'
Making it more favourable, by raising local fuel prices, is, the minister
stressed, 'a very sensitive issue which depends on the economic and social
problems of society'. A swift resolution to Iran's present problems over
short-term foreign debt will undoubtedly help its ability to attract
international finance. But only the politically courageous implementation of
structural economic reforms will allow Iran to take more effective domestic
advantage of its single greatest asset.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Arts: Grown from the earth of Malta / A look at a sensitive
design for a new arts centre in Valletta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Malta is still a glamorous island with a past that has left behind a
remarkably rich architectural heritage. You cannot get away from the fact
that the place is composed of limestone which has been used for centuries as
the basic building material. This has given the island a distinctive unity:
walls, bastions, fortifications, palaces and churches fill the skyline. They
are varied in style, but all look as though they have grown from the earth.
Malta has always drawn a rich variety of travellers to its shores; poets and
writers have followed a succession of conquerors. It was Coleridge who
arrived shortly after the British had captured the island from the French in
1814 and wrote: 'One's first feeling is, that this is all strange; and when
you begin to understand a little of the meaning and the uses of the massy,
endless walls and defiles, and then you feel and perceive that this is very
wonderful. A city all of freestone, all the houses looking new; all with
flat roofs, the streets all straight, and at right angles to each other; but
many of them exceedingly steep, none quite level; of the steep streets, some
are stepped with the smooth stone . . . the whole island looks like one
monstrous fortification . . . the fortifications of Valletta are endless . .
. such vast masses, bulky mountain breasted heights.'
Malta is still a paradise for the military historian and even more of a
paradise for the architectural enthusiast. There are 300 churches in the
group of islands and more are still being built. Piety and an enthusiasm for
building seem to go together. Malta is fortunate in having a small but
significant group of architects and artists who appreciate its very special
qualities. This is not to say that the island is unspoilt - one million
tourists a year and a tendency for aspiring locals to move out of older
parts of the towns and build new houses that could be built anywhere - is
leading to a decline in standards. But the smallness of the island means
that the group of good designers and artists can have considerable
influence. One of the leading architects there is Richard England, who has
made Malta his personal crusade.
In London at the moment there is a small, colourful and cheering exhibition
of his work, lifting the spirits in the London winter and offering a lot of
encouragement to architects who believe, as I do, that it is perfectly
possible to create new buildings in old places if the problem is approached
with sensitivity, respect and love.
It is some nine years since I last wrote about Richard England's work and it
was fascinating to see in his exhibition at the Building Centre in Store St,
WC1, how he has developed and changed.
In a recessionary world where architects are finding it hard to sustain
their practices, it is hard not to envy Mr England the range of his work.
Building continues in Malta to house and cater for the successful tourist
industry. There is money even for churches and opera houses, and England is
a leading contender for the rebuilding of the opera house in Valletta.
Surprisingly, Malta had an opera house that was designed by Edward Middleton
Barry - the architect of the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden. He
was commissioned to design an opera house for Malta in 1860, at a time when
the island acquired a crop of major late 19th century buildings in the
flourishing days of British rule.
Barry designed a theatre with a huge portico that would have looked at home
in London, Manchester or Liverpool. By designing it in an office in London,
Barry ignored the fact of the steeply sloping streets and had to raise the
whole thing on a grand podium to cope with the changes of level. The opera
house also had a chequered career - it was gutted by fire in 1873;
completely rebuilt; and then, badly damaged by bombs in the second world
war, closed down.
Today the island authorities want to encourage a lively evening life in
Valletta and the building of an arts complex on the opera house site is
their next priority. Richard England's scheme proposes utilising the
marvellous remains of the great portico and building splendid public spaces
behind it in an uncompromising but powerful modern style. His design is very
effective and original.
If and when the opera house/arts centre is built, it will be close to the
new city gates by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. He won the 'Malta
Gates' competition with a design that responds intelligently to the island's
traditions without venturing down the paths of pastiche.
In his exhibition Richard England shows another example of one of his
skilful designs fitting in to the old fabric of the city. His new Central
Bank of Malta in Valletta is built inside the massive walls of one of the
great fortifications. By lighting the centre of the new premises with a
great atrium it has been possible to build an important new facility for the
island which is more or less invisible.
This will not be the case for the San Tumas Tourist Village, a kind of
terraced pyramid of flats and rooms. While this can never be recessive it
can fit in to the island because Richard England recognises the elemental
nature of the cubist vernacular stone houses. This is something basic to the
island which adapts to modern architecture very successfully.
I enjoyed the way Richard England's architecture is now using more colour in
a bravely cubist way. His work succeeds for two main reasons: drawing and
style. The many prints and drawings in the exhibition demonstrate that he
has completely absorbed the architecture of his native island. While drawing
clearly helps him to absorb the qualities of the architecture, he uses this
skill to develop a style of his own, successfully relating to the elements
of the island's tradition. Malta is fortunate to have him to lead the
profession on the island.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Arts: The Prisoners of War - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The New End Theatre in Hampstead has unearthed a minor masterpiece in J R
Ackerley's The Prisoners of War. Ackerley is perhaps most remembered for his
autobiographical novel 'We Think the World of You', published in 1961. He
had become literary editor of The Listener in 1935 and held the post for
nearly a quarter of a century. He died in 1967.
His dramatic work came early on. Prisoners will always have a footnote in
theatrical history because it was the first English 20th century play to
deal seriously and overtly with homosexuality and to be passed by the
censor, who may have missed the point. It was first performed at the Royal
Court in 1925. What I did not know before, however, is what a play it is in
its own right.
Prisoners works not because it is shocking (it is not) but because it is
such splendidly mature drama. In terms of theatrical development it looks
back to the best of Harley Granville-Barker at the beginning of the century,
where grown-up people attempted to discuss grown-up subjects, and forward to
Terence Rattigan where the limits to what can be said even by articulate
people had become recognised. It is an uncanny coincidence that Rattigan's
The Deep Blue Sea should be revived at the Almeida in Islington almost at
the same time as Prisoners is rediscovered in Hampstead. The two plays have
a remarkable amount in common and you should try not to see one without the
other.
Ackerley's piece is set in Murren, Switzerland in 1918. The prisoners of war
are genuine: they are officers removed from camps in Britain or Germany to
neutral territory where the conditions are reasonably civilised, including
tennis, dancing and some freedom to move within the country. But the
background of the war is to some extent a subterfuge. These are males in a
predominantly male institution; the extended meaning of prisoner is
homosexual.
One, in particular, stands out. He is Captain Jim Conrad, played to
perfection at the New End by Ashley Russell. He has the best rooms in the
Swiss guest house, invites the other officers to use them as a mess room,
but plainly has eyes only for Second Lieutenant Grayle (Neil Roberts). Both
Conrad and Grayle are virgins, Conrad because of his proclivities, Grayle
because is so young. A large part of the play is about Conrad's frustrated
feelings.
There is at least one subplot. Another British officer forms an attachment
to the Canadian Captain Rickman to the point that they want to set up
business together in Canada. It is left deliberately unclear whether this is
a homosexual relationship.
Russell as Conrad is about as moving as you can get without going over the
edge. He is not handsome, has strangely protruding teeth and a tendency to
wear shorts when others are in long trousers. The emotion is nearly, but not
always, suppressed. In the end he breaks down, a pathetic figure who is a
prisoner of convention. The play is flawlessly directed by Ken Butler.

A group of some of South Africa's less charming citizens is the subject of
Cutting Edge's investigation, Soweto Flying Squad (C4, 9.00). Here is the
stuff of late-20th century heroics. The squad is made up of young men,
single, white, and heavily armed. They patrol the violent streets of Soweto,
shooting and being shot, in a nightmarish world of urban violence in which
the niceties of legal procedure can have no place.
The advance of capitalism in China, partly overt and partly by stealth, is
the subject of two films in tonight's edition of South (C4, 11.00), the
documentary series which screens the work of film-makers from the southern
hemisphere. A film about Hong Kong focuses on the powerful alliance between
leading figures in the colony's business life and the Communist hierarchy on
the mainland, and the problems this poses for governor Chris Patten.
Does Robert Redford, now pushing 60, still deserve to be called one of the
best-looking men in the world? In Film 93 Special (BBC 1, 10.10) he talks to
Barry Norman.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Arts: American String Quartet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until this weekend the American String Quartet had never appeared in London,
though they have been performing for almost 20 years and are regular
European visitors. At home they are loyal champions of new American music,
as well as of Schoenberg; but they chose to bring only works by DWEMs (dead,
white European males) to the Wigmore Hall, with only Bartok to represent the
twentieth century.
Accuracy, clarity and transparent balance are their great virtues. They
boast a notably strong second violin, and a viola that sports more pungent
character than their suave cello, which means that middle voices stand out
uncommonly well without protruding. The quartet's lucid textures are partly
achieved, I think, by a gingerly avoidance of dramatic extremes: on Saturday
there was scarcely a real fortissimo, nor a pianissimo either, until their
closing Bartok Fourth.
Even there, though the music occasionally sizzled it never seared. The
rhythms were admirably precise, but without the expected truculent thrust.
In the muted Prestissimo, which was in its way a tour de force, the
semiquaver buzzes rarely stung. Yet as a study-performance, it was all
correctly and quite vigorously set out, and jewelled with scrupulous detail;
one could learn from it.
They had begun with the A major quartet from Beethoven's op. 18. It slipped
smoothly by without leaving much impression. Odd approach to tempi: the
Americans chose mostly speeds on the high side, but kept to them so
metronomically that there was neither an exciting pulse nor room for
dramatic emphases. Their leader's tone, excellent for spinning a cultivated
line, lacked depth here. It was better found in Schuberts' great A minor
quartet, lyrically crepuscular; and indeed all the players had distinguished
moments in that haunted work, where they allowed themselves more freedom.
Nevertheless, the expressive climate remained very temperate, as if
restrained by a prudent thermostat. The grand breadth of the Schubert was
merely suggested, not vitally realised. One might conclude that these
musicians are not primarily interested in performing, in the vulgar full
sense - though jet-lag might have been the only problem this time. But I
felt too unconfident that their Mendelssohn and Dvorak on Sunday would rise
to more exciting heights to feel like taking my streaming cold back to the
Wigmore to find out.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Arts: Anne-Sophie Mutter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are few soloists who command such respect in the profession that their
audiences are made up of other musicians. On Friday at the Barbican Hall the
picture at the cloakroom told its own story - staff having to deal with not
only a capacity audience, but also dozens of violin cases being deposited by
their owners for safe-keeping.
The violinists in the audience, student and professional, had come to hear
Anne-Sophie Mutter. As her last solo appearance in London memorably showed,
she is an enthralling recitalist. It is fairly safe to say that there is no
other violinist active today who can approach the range of colours which she
can draw from the instrument and that feature of her playing alone is enough
to hold an audience spellbound.
In the fragmented, quickly changing sound-world of Lutoslawski's Partita the
effect was dazzling. This is a work with which Mutter has become closely
associated, as Lutoslawski has made for her a newly-composed orchestral
version of the score, but she brought to this performance of the original
Partita with piano so kaleidoscopic a spread of tone colours that no
orchestra was needed. From the first note each phrase spoke with its own
character. The slightest wisp of melody sang; the briefest motif asserted
itself.
The late C Major Fantasy of Schubert opened with playing at the other
extreme, a blissful calm, devoid of tension, long phrases floating on a soft
breeze of tenderness. The slow movement is a set of variations on the song
'Sei mir gegrusst' and it is difficult to imagine any vocalist singing the
music more beautifully.
In some of her recent recordings Mutter's way with classical composers has
been in danger of sounding over-ripe, but that was not the case here, either
with the Schubert or Beethoven's 'Kreutzer' sonata. It may be that close
microphone placing does her playing an injustice. In the hall, her vigorous
attack in the Beethoven, the scale, the wealth of colours, all sounded in
proportion and matched, too, by her imaginative accompanist, Lambert Orkis,
who is better-known in this country for his work on period instruments.
There were two encores: the first - the arrangement by Heifetz of Debussy's
'Beau soir' - was sheer enchantment, shimmering nocturnal beauty.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Arts: Loudon Wainwright III - Rock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Families worry Loudon Wainwright. For more than 20 years his songwriting
career has been spattered with songs that gnaw away at the raw bones of
relationships - father and son, brother and sister, husband and wife, parent
and child. Now as Wainwright drifts through middle age his songs seem
preoccupied more and more with putting the record straight. History, his
latest release, was originally going to be called 'Family Album'; the 14
songs range across the domestic battle field, bleakly cataloguing the
casualties.
His current British tour may be aimed at boosting the sales of History but
in concert the effect is anything but bleak; Wainwright himself comes over
as an energetic, hardworking performer, and immensely likeable. The running
order seems half-improvised, the banter spontaneous. Among the post-Dylan
generation of singer-songwriters he is much closer to Randy Newman than to,
say, Neil Young or Springsteen; he shares with Newman a liking for black
irony, though not his penchant for disguise. With Wainwright there is no
concealment, the nerve ends are bared and the confessional element is
patent.
The humour becomes a vital safety valve, undercutting the despair of his
lyrics, numbing the pain of the idealism that gradually has been eaten away.
Even 'Talking Bob Dylan', Wainwright's witty tribute to his begetter, has a
sharp edge as he charts his hero's progress and implicitly compares it with
his own. Most of the time, he can't help himself - 'Boys kiss girls, make
them cry/That's a man's job'. But when the humour drops away the effect can
be devastating: in 'Hitting You', which traces his disintegrating
relationship with his daughter, there is nothing but despair.
There were old songs too - 'Be Careful There's a Baby in the House' from
1971 and a rousing C &amp; W version of 'Dead Skunk' - as well as something
brand new, in Wainwright's hymn to the Clinton inauguration: 'Talking about
our generation/Hope we grow up before we get old'. The subject matter, as
always, doesn't bear thinking about; it is a tribute to Wainwright's feisty
resilience that his audience are able laugh a lot more than they cry; look
at me, he's telling them, I know it's all awful, but I'm still here, still
laughing.

<TEXT>
BRYANT CONSTRUCTION has won a Pounds 21m contract to build the international
headquarters in Harlow, Essex for Longman Group, a member of the Pearson
Group, owner of the Financial Times.
Next to Longman's existing Harlow headquarters, the new block, designed by
architects Conran Roche, will be six storeys high, over 170,000 sq ft and
have a roof garden, conservatory and restaurant. The design team has
developed a naturally ventilated building which relies primarily on passive
measures to save energy.
The building plan places 13.5 metre wide office floor plates on either side
of a 12 metre wide atrium. Both sides of the office areas have opening
windows so that air can cross- ventilate from the outside and into the atria
where a natural stack effect is created to assist in the general movement
and vent the heated air at high level.
At night the process is maintained to cool exposed concrete soffits in the
offices to offset heat gain during the day.
Windows in both the external and atrium walls are at high level to allow as
much air as possible to pass over the slab. Windows at low level will give
localised control.

FT  08 FEB 93 / People: Charles Schwab to set up in UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ethel Daly is moving to London to set up shop in Mayfair on behalf of
America's biggest discount stockbroker Charles Schwab.
'It had always been part of our strategy to come to Europe; it was just a
question of timing,' says Daly, newly appointed managing director of the
international division, who arrives to tell the story of the US recovery,
and the relative attractiveness of equities since dollar interest rates are
so low.
She has been at Schwab, which boasts a 49 per cent share of the discount
market at home, and has around 2m active investors with Dollars 66bn in
client assets, since 1987. Her last job was as senior vice-president of
retail service delivery which involved managing 90 branch and seven regional
offices in the eastern part of America.
She says she has a fair amount of international experience, including during
her time at Crocker National Bank in the late 1970s where, working on the
foreign exchange operation systems side, she led a group representing West
Coast banks which were then introducing the European payments system SWIFT.
With chairman and founder Charles Schwab in London next month to launch a
new product and unveil the European strategy, Daly will not elaborate on the
service she, with two others, proposes to market.
And the competition? 'I'm trying not to be arrogant, but in terms of the
overall package, I don't think there is anybody,' she comments from the
company's headquarters in San Francisco.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTT MACDONALD has been commissioned by the National Rivers Authority
(Anglian Region) to design and supervise construction of the fourth and
final phase of the Pounds 20m barrier banks project - this focuses on the
northern and central sections of the banks. The 65km barrier banks in East
Anglia protect up to 75,000ha of agricultural land and have a history
stretching back some 300 years when drainage of the Fens began.
Remedial works for the final northern and central phase will involve the
removal of cracking clay soils and their replacement with imported fill and
reprofiling of significant lengths of embankment using imported material,
some of which has been won locally. In order to transport materials to the
site some 10km of haul roads (generally granular sub-base over geotextile)
will have to be constructed, in addition to the 35km already provided in
earlier phases.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Management: Virtual factory takes shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new buzzphrase is entering the European lexicon of industrial jargon - the
'virtual factory'. The concept is already common among US management experts
to denote how companies can rejuvenate themselves by tapping sources of
external expertise, rather than duplicating it themselves.
Now, however, those high-powered researchers at Insead, the French-based
European Institute of Business Administration, have concluded that the
virtual factory idea could be one answer to the perennial problem of
Europe's global competitiveness.
Insead's just published bi-yearly survey* of manufacturing strategies -
based on data from 108 big European industrial companies - acknowledges that
companies have now absorbed the principles of customer-driven manufacturing
such as total-quality management or just-in-time practices.
The strategy has paid off in terms of performance improvements on the
factory floor. The big problem, though, is that it has not bolstered the
competitive position of European manufacturing.
Insead admits that the economic environment must be one reason why
manufacturing improvements have not been translated into profits or
increased market shares. But perhaps, it suggests, there is a more
structural reason.
This is that all manufacturers worldwide have adopted the same sort of
techniques - known collectively as 'lean manufacturing' and borrowed or
adapted from the Japanese - and are now fighting on a level field. Something
extra is required if a manufacturer is to gain competitive advantage.
'Finding this new way of manufacturing is perhaps less easy for Europeans
than in the past,' says Insead. 'We have got used to looking east for
examples of outstanding manufacturing. But even Japanese manufacturers do
not seem to have a clear picture of what looms beyond the horizon.'
According to the survey, the best of Europe's senior manufacturing managers
are now integrating manufacturing within the value-added chain, both with
other functions in the company and with suppliers and customers.
This is what Insead calls the 'virtual factory' - a factory which performs
its task of transforming materials and components into value for the
customer by using resources outside the manufacturing function itself. The
resources of the suppliers, marketing and sales, engineering, even the
customer, have to be mobilised.
According to Insead, its discussions with managers reveal concepts such as
virtual logistics. Responsibility for the flow of goods and organisation is
assigned to a virtual logistics manager, but without giving that person a
logistics organisation.
The implications for the manufacturing manager are significant. 'The concept
of a virtual factory requires that tasks get carried out by networks of
resources inside and outside manufacturing,' says Insead.
'These networks will not emerge spontaneously but require manufacturing
managers to pay attention more than ever to relations with their peers and
partners.'
Unfortunately, Insead's evidence suggests that most European manufacturers
are not yet ready for the task, which depends on three conditions: a clear
and shared vision throughout the organisation, an unambiguous commitment to
the improvements of human resources, and a reasonable willingness to
experiment with new manufacturing methods.
But, says the report, there seems to be insufficient investment in all three
areas to reach the ambitious goals of the virtual factory.
As with lean manufacturing, though, the big question may be whether European
companies can gain any competitive advantage from the virtual factory.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Nervous end to roller-coaster ride: The uncertain future
facing the railway supply industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A 120-year roller-coaster ride through the peaks and troughs of
equipment contracting, Britain's railway supply industry is facing an
uncertain future.
Domestic orders are drying up, and the controversial privatisation of
British Rail is looming - last week the government named seven sections of
BR that could be in private sector hands by the end of next year.
On top of that - and in spite of a likely go-ahead for the Pounds 300m
Heathrow Express - there is continuing uncertainty over money-spinning
'mega-projects' such as London Underground's Pounds 1.7bn Jubilee Line
extension and the Pounds 2.5bn Channel tunnel rail link.
The industry has reached a critical point. At stake are more than 60
companies with combined annual turnover of about Pounds 1.75bn, although the
top 20 companies account for Pounds 1.2bn of the sales.
Some of those companies are giants of the European engineering scene such as
GEC Alsthom and Asea Brown Boveri. Yet all are feeling the effects of the
current squeeze.
'If we don't get an order in the UK in the next six months, we'll not be
here by the end of 1994,' says Mr Graham Bradburn, commercial director at
Birmingham-based Hunslet Transportation Projects, a big producer of
passenger rail vehicles.
According to Mr David Gillan, director of the Railway Industry Association,
the equipment suppliers' trade body, privatisation puts about half the
industry's 30,000 jobs at risk immediately, and all of them in the long
term. For every employee in rail contracting there is another in industries
that are only partly dependent on rail business, supplying everything from
seats and carpets to nuts and bolts.
Yet, in a year when investment by British Rail has reached a record Pounds
1.6bn and London Underground spending is at comparatively high levels, are
things really as bad as industry leaders say?
Certainly, few rail equipment suppliers could have predicted their
predicament three years ago. After many years of relatively low domestic
demand, a considerable number of orders were placed in the late 1980s, with
the promise of more to come. The industry responded by expanding and
modernising its production facilities to enable it to meet projected demand.
At least a third of this year's spending by BR is related to Channel tunnel
business, but that is now declining.
The combined effects of the recession, which has dented BR's revenues, and
delays over the Channel tunnel rail link and other projects mean that some
suppliers will face serious declines in orders by the end of the year.
The increases in BR's external financing limit announced in the Autumn
Statement will not benefit suppliers, says Mr Gillan. 'It's new money for BR
but it will go to further subsidise loss-making services.'
As a result, a number of large contractors could run out of work by the
middle of next year, with smaller sub-contractors feeling the pinch even
earlier.
'There is a mistaken belief in the minds of ministers that a short gap in
production is sustainable,' says Mr Gillan. 'But shareholders don't allow
production capacity to be kept open against the possibility of getting
business.'
Then comes privatisation. The very people who ought to be planning rail
projects do not know where they are going to be in two years, says Mr
Gillan. A break in ordering is therefore inevitable.
Mr Bradburn at Austrian-owned Hunslet TPL says that any incoming private
franchisee will not be buying rolling stock until it knows what its
operating costs are, which could take two years.
He doubts, too, whether franchisees will be keen to lease rolling stock
unless they receive guarantees on issues such as residual values - the value
of equipment at the end of a lease. The government is allowing BR to lease
up to Pounds 150m of rolling stock in the next three years to create a
leasing market in the run-up to privatisation.
Perhaps the best hope for the industry is if the government ties the award
of franchises to spending on rolling stock and infrastructure, a possibility
that Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, has not ruled out.
But the question remains whether suppliers can make it through the next two
years and on to the mid 1990s and the next century, when some of the
projects under discussion or delayed may at last take place.

FT  08 FEB 93 / 'Yobs' blow loud Euro-raspberry at Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOUNG Conservatives yesterday looked to the mainland of Europe from the
seaside resort of Southend and, to the embarrassment of their elders, blew
an enormous raspberry at Mr John Major's policy on Europe.
By a large majority of hands and even more foot-stomping, they rejected a
motion that reflected the prime minister's policy. It said Britain's best
interests would be served 'by playing an active role in the development of
the European Community'.
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister and YC life patron, was booed
and hissed, and his likening of young Euro-rebels to yobs was turned back on
him. 'If I'm a football hooligan then at least when I go to the Continent I
fight for Britain,' said Mr Matthew Palmer of London Young Conservatives.
The young Tories, after a few years' good behaviour for the general
election, were back on form.
'It is a peculiar culture,' said one cabinet minister, leaving the
conference after making his speech. Most of the big-name speakers stayed
little more than a few hours; Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party
chairman, left soon after lunch on Saturday.
In the late 1980s the battles were between Heathite 'wets' and Thatcherite
'drys'. Now, reduced in numbers, they refight the 1990 Tory leadership
battle. Baroness Thatcher is cheered on every mention, Mr Michael Heseltine,
the trade and industry secretary who brought her down, is jeered.
Perhaps to his embarrassment, Mr Peter Lilley, the rightwing social security
secretary, received the best reception. Part of his speech was on economic
policy since Black Wednesday. He got only as far as 'since we left the ERM .
. . ' before the cheering started. If he wanted to smile, Mr Lilley hid his
emotions beautifully.
The Europe debate saw copies of the Maastricht treaty torn up, and
government loyalists shouted down. 'Maastricht is a good deal for Britain
and we should jump at the chance to ratify it,' began one speaker to shouts
of 'lies'. 'Only joking,' he added quickly.
The hunched figure of Sir Teddy Taylor, local MP and leading Euro-sceptic,
sat at the front. Afterwards he quoted 'that rather strange singer' Bob
Marley, urging his young friends to 'stand up for your rights and keep
fighting'.
The conference slogan, 'Young Conservatives, the next generation', adapted
the sub-title of Star Trek's new series. Mr Major may sometimes wish he can
beam them into space.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Treasury targets invalidity benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 5.5bn budget for invalidity benefit emerged yesterday as one of
the Treasury's first targets for savings as the government prepared to
embark on its strategic review of spending on the welfare state.
Whitehall officials confirmed that a 'bottom-up' scrutiny of spending on
education and on law and order would join the analysis of social security
and health budgets in the first stage of the spending review.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, will start the
process this week in preliminary meetings with Mr Peter Lilley, the social
security secretary, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the home secretary, and Mr John Patten, the education secretary.
Mr Lilley signalled at the Young Conservatives' conference in Southend that
he is prepared to consider a fundamental shift towards the private provision
of social security benefits, using the current system of 'contracting out'
of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps) as a model.
But as the implied attack on benefits prompted disquiet among MPs in the
centre and on the left of the Conservative party, a Treasury minister
offered assurances that there was no immediate threat to the core of the
welfare state. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury,
said on BBC radio that the government would respect the commitments on
pensions and state benefits given before last year's general election.
His comments were echoed by ministers in the main spending departments who
insisted that the state retirement pension and child benefit were
'sacrosanct' until the next general election.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said wide-ranging questions would be
asked during the review but added: 'That is a long way from decisions having
being taken.'
There were suggestions that Mr Portillo and Mr Lilley - both leading members
of the rightwing No Turning Back Group - wanted to use the review to
'hijack' the future direction of the Tory party.
Other ministers, however, warned that the tax increases now regarded as
inevitable in one or other of this year's two Budgets would be 'saleable' to
rightwing Tory MPs only if they were accompanied by cuts in welfare
spending.
Mr Lilley indicated that one scheme under study was for individuals to make
their own provision for disability in employment, allowing them to 'contract
out' of the state invalidity benefit, which is projected to cost about
Pounds 7bn annually by 1995. The same principle could be extended to
unemployment benefit although the sums involved, about Pounds 1.5bn a year,
are smaller.
The Treasury has been pressing for faster savings by making invalidity
benefit subject to income tax.
This idea was discussed by ministers last autumn but dropped because of the
likely political furore. But, with public borrowing threatening to reach
Pounds 50bn next year, some ministers believe that the government must take
unpopular decisions to underpin its credibility with financial markets.
Mrs Bottomley told the Southend conference that she wanted more
private-sector involvement in healthcare. 'The private and voluntary sectors
should be regarded as partners not pariahs,' she said.
The search for savings in the Home Office and education budgets meanwhile is
expected to focus on the potential for breaking the link between police pay
and average earnings, on increased privatisation of prison services and on a
nationwide closure programme of undersubscribed schools to reduce the number
of surplus places.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Minister criticises service from banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH-STREET banks were criticised by a Department of Trade and Industry
minister yesterday for their service to small businesses.
Baroness Denton, minister responsible for small businesses, said banks
needed to show a greater understanding - and to base lending more on past
performance than stagnant or falling property values.
'In the service supplied to my constituents (small business), there is a
long way to go,' she said.
Her remarks to the Young Conservatives' conference in Southend contrasted
with the Treasury's recent review of banks' treatment of small businesses
which largely exonerated them of failing to pass on interest rate cuts.
They also reflected the Trade and Industry Department's DTI's emphasis on
wealth creation via industry.
Baroness Denton said small businesses were not 'simple' but often used
advanced technology and were exporters.
Baroness Denton said 99 per cent of businesses employed fewer than 200
people. 'It is crucial for the health of the economy and job creation that
these companies are allowed to prosper,' she said.
Before addressing the conference she suggested banks should look to boosting
regional enterprise funds set aside for lending to growing businesses,
citing Midland Bank as an example.
She also wanted to see a replacement for the Unlisted Securities Market,
which is due to close, to encourage finance for entrepreneurs.
Baroness Denton said banks should follow the German example and link their
own prospects to those of their small busines clients.
She said of the attitude of some high-street banks to falling borrowings by
small businesses: 'If it is good news for them that small businesses are
borrowing less, where is our growth going to come from?'
She said small companies could also help themselves by recognising that the
injection of equity by outside investors could help their expansion.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Hospitals decision due this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS are due to complete decisions on the future of London's hospitals
this week in the face of conflicting pressures.
In a government-commissioned report Sir Bernard Tomlinson recommended
hospital closures that would cut 2,500 beds in the capital, transferring
resources to the family doctor and community services. There are indications
that the government, worried about possible public reaction, is considering
deferring or diluting the closure recommendations. But many National Health
Service managers believe the consequences of delay would be worse than
pressing ahead.
Dr Martin McNicol, chairman of the NHS Trust Federation - which represents
trust hospital boards - says in an article today that London's hospital
service is 'crumbling financially and the fabric will soon follow'.
Londoners, says Dr McNicol, faced the loss of 'cathedrals of care' that had
looked after many generations of the capital's population. But the reasons
for this were cogent. The lost hospitals needed to be replaced by a service
more responsive to the requirements of patients.
Dr McNicol's comments, written with Dr Fiona Moss, consultant physician at
the Central Middlesex Hospital, appear in London After Tomlinson, a
collection of articles by leading medical and other figures published today
by the British Medical Journal.
Many of the contributors support Tomlinson's proposal to transfer resources,
and see the report as an opportunity to restructure health provision in
London. But there are several warnings that the new community-based
infrastructure must be properly financed if hospitals are to close.
Dr Bobbie Jacobson, director of public health for the City and Hackney
Health Authority - whose biggest hospital, St Bartholomew's, is resisting a
closure recommendation - says that without adequate funding for better local
services 'the Tomlinson report will simply be a further exercise in cutting
health services to Londoners'.
Ministers are considering a rescue plan to retain Bart's as a smaller,
largely specialist hospital, and may be planning to phase other closures
over a long period. Delay would, however, leave financial problems in the
London hospital service unresolved.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Boost for leading pension managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG performances by two leading fund management houses last year are
likely to lead to further concentration of the management of Britain's
occupational pension funds.
Preliminary data shows that Gartmore and Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management
(PDFM) outperformed the median rate of return by at least 5 and 3 percentage
points respectively.
The other two of the biggest four active managers, Mercury and Schroder, are
believed to have been some way behind but still close to the average.
Gartmore, which now manages pension funds worth Pounds 10.5bn, after adding
Pounds 1.8bn in new business last year, claims a median rate of return of
25.8 per cent for its client funds. Its pooled fund, Gartmore Long-Term
Balanced, a unitised fund used by certain smaller clients, returned 29 per
cent.
A performance measurement company called Caps estimates that the median
pension fund return in 1992 was 20.6 per cent, although this may be revised
when more results are filed.
According to Mr David Watts, head of pension funds at Gartmore, it was 'a
most remarkable year' in which the managers added value in every area.
The main elements included a heavy overseas exposure and, within that, an
emphasis on dollar assets, which paid off handsomely in the final quarter.
At PDFM, which manages about twice as much pension fund money as Gartmore,
there was a good performance in UK equities and a profitable exposure to
French bonds, said Mr Tony Dye, the company's investment strategist. But
risks were reduced by a high (10 per cent to 11 per cent) investment in
index-linked gilt-edged stock.
Consultants say there was an unusually large spread between the best and the
worst results last year. One fund with two management companies found there
was a 9 per cent gap in performance between them.
Pension fund management has become highly competitive and in recent years
contracts have been gravitating towards a handful of successful investment
houses. According to a consultant: 'These results will intensify the move
towards the majors.'
But it is performance over several years rather than a single year that
counts. 'We are having to spend our time dampening down our clients'
expectations,' said Mr Watts.
Caps has published performance figures for the pooled funds of about 60
investment institutions, which also show a wide range of investment
performance.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Tory policies pump up numbers in Whitehall: Agencies recruit
for market testing - Civil Service grows bt more than 11,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE GROWTH in the Civil Service
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
recent Treasury statistics on staffing show a 11,456 increase in the year to
April 1 1992 - is partly the result of government initiatives such as
contracting out.
According to one Whitehall mandarin: 'Every department and agency now has to
have a market-testing unit - which means extra people on the payroll.'
Analysis by the Financial Times shows that one area of growth has been the
executive agencies set up to provide government services on more
businesslike lines.
One agency chief suggested to the FT that the process of creating agencies
had itself required extra staff to manage the new units. 'Devolution of
management responsibilities means replicating functions in each agency which
were previously provided by centralised Whitehall departments,' he said.
Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the Policy Unit at the Institute of Directors,
condemned the growth: 'There has been no overall reduction in number of
people employed in the public sector, which has failed to match the
efficiency gains made in private sector companies such as BT.
'If the chancellor is going to reduce public spending to curb the budget
deficit, he has no alternative but to look at the number of people employed
in the public services.'
Of the 28 oldest Whitehall agencies 21 have taken on more staff since being
freed from direct control of Whitehall departments.
Substantial growth in the Employment Service is linked to the rise in
unemployment. But many smaller agencies such as the Radiocommunications
Agency and the Social Security IT Services Agency have also added numbers
since 1990.
In many cases, the extra staff have been taken on to meet increased demand
for services once agencies have been given their entrepreneurial head.
However, the 28 oldest agencies had increased their staff from 74,927 at
inception to 84,081 by April 1992, a 12 per cent increase.
The growth in staff in the agencies raises questions over the success of
executive agencies in controlling costs, says Professor Peter Hennessey,
professor of contemporary history at Queen Mary College, London and a
specialist on Whitehall. 'It is very depressing that Mrs Thatcher's crude
axe of fixed targets appears to be the only approach which works,' he said.
The growth in the Civil Service - which now has a total staff of 565,319 -
runs contrary to the government's claim at the last general election that it
has reduced the number of civil servants to the lowest level since the
second world war.
While the blue-collar Civil Service continues to shrink, the drive to reduce
the number of white-collar civil servants appears to have run out of steam.
The number of white-collar civil servants increased last year, taking the
total back to the level of 1984.
Reducing the number of civil servants was one of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's
highest priorities when the Conservatives came to power in 1979. She
inherited a Civil Service of 732,000 and launched a campaign to reduce the
number of civil servants by 100,000 by April 1994.
That target was comfortably achieved, with the number of white-collar staff
falling by more than 60,000. This drop of 11 per cent was largely achieved
by setting across-the-board staffing targets which forced departments to
become more streamlined and abandon some activities.
However, the biggest cuts proportionately fell on the industrial civil
servants, the blue-collar employees working mainly in defence areas and the
Property Services Agency. Their numbers fell by more than a quarter as naval
dockyards were closed and Royal Ordnance Factories privatised.
While overall staffing in the Civil Service has continued to shrink since
1984, the reduction has been entirely among the industrial staff. By April
1992 the industrial Civil Service had fallen to 61,082 employees, 37 per
cent of the total in 1979.
The number of white-collar civil servants has stuck around 500,000 since
1984. Although some departments such as trade and industry have reduced
their white-collar payrolls, others such as the Home Office and the social
security department have grown.
Ministerial policy decisions are often responsible for the growth in
departmental staff. For example, the expansion of the prison service has
contributed to the growth in the size of the Home Office. The creation of
the Crown Prosecution Service has added almost 5,700 civil servants to the
total to do work previously done by the police.
The economy also influences numbers of civil servants. For example, growing
unemployment has required 9,000 extra staff in the in the past two years to
pay benefits, counsel the unemployed and run schemes for the long-term
jobless. The housing boom in the 1980s greatly increased the work of the
Land Registry. Similarly, when the economy was buoyant, more cars were
bought, adding to the burden of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency at
Swansea.

A GROWING army of 'invisible' homeworkers, including an increasing number of
men, should receive the same pay and conditions as on-site workers, a report
urges today.
'Homeworkers represent a small but growing proportion of Britain's
workforce, yet they remain invisible and marginalised,' said the report's
author, Ms Michelle Reeves of the Greater Manchester Low Pay Unit.
Estimates suggest there could be as many as 30,000 such workers in the
region.

It was written by Mr David Willetts, Conservative MP for Havant and a member

<TEXT>
MOST public sector employers are likely to observe the 1.5 per cent pay
limit announced by the chancellor in the 1992 Autumn Statement, but the
policy is creating serious difficulties for them, say pay analysts Incomes
Data Services.
An IDS guide says: 'Government ministers are now seeking to impose a
centralised decision on pay where previously they had promoted public sector
reforms designed to decentralise decision making. These reforms probably
make the limit harder to enforce.'
IDS found public sector employers were having to put off changes in pay
arrangements, including the introduction of performance-pay schemes. A
number were worried the limit would have an adverse impact on staff morale.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Revenue accounts proposals attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INLAND REVENUE proposals to require self-employed people to prepare their
accounts for the tax year ending in April would place 'impossible pressures'
on accountants, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants warned
today, Andrew Jack writes.
At the moment a range of deadlines is available for the self-employed. In
response to the Revenue's consultative document on restructuring the tax
system issued late last year, the association argues against the case for
'fiscal accounting'. It says accounts preparation for the self-employed
would be compressed into a six-month period that is already taken up with
pay-as-you-earn tax work. That would force businesses to recruit temporary
staff, and threaten to jeopardise the quality of tax preparation work
carried out.
The association also says that the proposals shift the administrative burden
on to the taxpayer, and could lead to the creation of a more adversarial
system.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Vauxhall acts to reduce stocks held by dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL IS introducing a new car distribution system intended to reduce
stocks held at dealers' premises and cut the total number of vehicles in its
supply pipeline by 20 per cent.
When fully implemented by 1995, it is expected to save the company and its
dealers 'tens of millions of pounds a year', according to Mr Dean Barrett,
marketing services director of the General Motors subsidiary.
More than half of all new Vauxhalls sold are transferred between dealerships
to satisfy customer orders, rather than supplied directly to the dealer by
Vauxhall.
In future Vauxhall's 535 dealers will draw their cars from a network of five
large storage facilities, each linked strategically to either a Vauxhall
manufacturing plant or, in the case of imported vehicles, their port of
entry.
The system bears some similarities to that already instituted at rival Rover
Group, which last autumn opened a network of seven wholly owned regional
distribution centres.
As with the Vauxhall system, Rover's dealers carry only showroom stock and
test vehicles. They no longer carry bulk stocks in their compounds but call
up cars as they are ordered from the seven regional centres.
Rover, which has smaller UK sales than Vauxhall, believes its own system
could save the group and its dealers up to Pounds 80m a year.
Traditionally, Vauxhall's dealers have held six weeks' or more of stocks,
swapping them as necessary as orders for a particular specification and
colour came in.
The new system is scheduled to start in the spring.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Economists still gloomy on growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST reduction in interest rates and falls in the value of the pound
have done little to alleviate pessimism among economists working in
industry.
After last week's turmoil on the foreign exchanges and arguments over the
government's decision to cut base rates to 6 per cent, they remain uncertain
about the strength and direction of economic growth.
Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at ICI, the UK's biggest chemicals
company, said he has detected no discernible sign of recovery in industry.
'Exports have picked up a bit,' he said. 'It is very important that the
pound does not rise too much from where it is now as we have got to make
sure we maintain our competitiveness.'
Ms Valerie Burton, chief economist at the Bass drinks, hotels and leisure
group, said fear of unemployment is still constraining spending.
'Low inflation hasn't really had much of an impact on people,' she said. 'We
will be bumping along the bottom for some time although I see a pick-up
towards the end of the year.'
At the Engineering Employers' Federation, Mr Ian Thompson, chief economist,
said a rise in confidence may have been registered, but with no
corresponding increase in actual business.
'The outlook for exports is mixed. It is good as far as cost competitiveness
is concerned, but our European markets are stagnant. I think there is more
gain than loss overall, but it is finely balanced.'
Mr Leslie Gunde, chief economist at the GKN engineering components group,
said: 'I have been encouraged by the apparent upturn in the car industry and
also by the Bundesbank's moves on interest rates. But apart from this the
signs about recovery are extremely patchy. Any tax increases in the Budget
would be unwise as they would hardly help confidence.'
Activity among retailers is similarly depressed. 'We have seen no sign of
economic recovery,' said Mr John Randall, finance director of MFI, the
furniture retailer. 'A lot of people are looking and a lot are inclined to
spend, but not quite to the point of putting their hands in their pockets.'
He believes people will need to feel comfortable about their job prospects
and the value of their homes before spending can recover properly.
Mr Barry Scott, head of economics at British Gas, was slightly more
optimistic: 'I remain confident that the lower pound and reduced interest
rates will have a powerful effect in helping recovery. But it's difficult to
see any discernible sign of this right now.'

FT  08 FEB 93 / Devaluation fillip expected for manufacturing areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALES and the north of England will benefit most from sterling's
devaluation, says a report published today by Cambridge Econometrics, the
research group.
In 1995 exports from Wales will be some 4.6 per cent higher than they would
have been if sterling had not left the European exchange rate mechanism in
September last year, the report says. The north of England will also benefit
by some 4 per cent because of its relatively high manufacturing base.
In contrast Greater London, with relatively little manufacturing, can expect
only a 1.6 per cent increase in exports. Northern Ireland, which
traditionally has had relatively low exports, will see the least impact with
a rise of only 1.4 per cent.
The report, which also surveys the outlook for each region, expects Greater
London and the west Midlands 'to have the highest rate of job loss as the
shake-out continues'.
In spite of the benefit to the north from devaluation, the report argues
that 'the tendency for regional disparities to narrow during the recession'
will reverse in the longer term. The south-east, 'by far the worst-affected
region during the recession', will see growth of gross domestic product
catch up or overtake that of the north between 1993 and 2005.
Overall, the report finds that the UK's GDP will be just under 2 per cent
higher in 1995 than it would have been without devaluation.

FT  08 FEB 93 / A taxman assesses years of change: Tax changes alter working
patterns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE postwar tower blocks of Southend in Essex may not seem the most obvious
place from which to watch the changing face of Whitehall. But the local tax
office has experienced many pressures from the Inland Revenue during the
1980s.
Many associate Thatcherism with rolling back the frontiers of the state and
winding down the number of civil servants employed by central government.
But that is certainly not the view of Mr Simon Lidster, former director of
taxes in Southend. 'Staffing has remained pretty much the same,' Mr Lidster
says. 'But there has been a big shift in emphasis in the type of work we do.
The changes balanced out.'
Total employment in the office is virtually unaltered from 1979. That is not
to say that numbers have not fluctuated. He recalls a modest wave of new
recruitment in 1990, for instance, after the introduction of independent
taxation for married women.
At other times, staffing was wound down, such as after the abolition of the
regular revaluations for the rates and the introduction of automatic
deductions of tax on bank and building society interest.
In the long term, most change has been in the jobs that people undertake.
'When I started, we didn't have computers,' he says. 'It was all paperwork.
That shifted about 10 years ago, and people moved on to compliance work.' As
with offices around the country, Southend introduced 'ghostbusters' - who
hunt for people who have never registered for tax - and others who chased
the other constituents of the black economy such as moonlighters.
Another employee in the Southend office during the 1980s says: 'It was a
time of great change and challenge. It wasn't an easy period to go through.
But I think everyone can see the benefits.'

FT  08 FEB 93 / BA and Virgin likely to renew talks today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways and Virgin Atlantic are likely today to renew talks in
London aimed at striking a peace deal in the wake of BA's 'dirty tricks'
campaign against its rival.
Virgin said yesterday that it wanted successful dis-cussions with BA but
that it still intended to take action against BA if a deal was not agreed
this week.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's executive chairman, said he wanted the talks to end
amicably and 'the sooner the better'.
Without a deal, Virgin threatens to begin anti-trust action in the US, as
well as alleging to the European Commission that BA has abused its dominant
market position. Virgin also might instigate court action under the Data
Protection Act or pursue claims of breach of copyright.
In three meetings held so far between the two sides, Virgin has claimed that
BA's activities inflicted upon it serious commercial damage running into
tens of millions of pounds.
Virgin has not publicly specified its demands, although it is understood to
have tabled a series of proposals. These range from cash compensation to the
use of BA aircraft-servicing facilities.
The allocation of take-off and landing 'slots' at London's Heathrow airport
is also thought to be on the agenda.
Although it is understood that some progress towards agreement has been
made, there is some surprise in the Virgin camp at the time the talks are
taking, and it appears determined not to see them drag on beyond this week.
Virgin is being represented by Mr Sid Pennington, managing director of
Virgin Atlantic, and Mr Trevor Abbott, financial adviser to Mr Richard
Branson, Virgin's chairman. Mr Robert Ayling, who on Friday was appointed
BA's group managing director, is representing BA.
If a deal is reached, it is likely that Mr Branson, will meet Sir Colin to
complete an agreement. Meanwhile, fall-out from Lord King's announcement
last friday that he would retire early from the post of BA chairman
continued over the weekend.
Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson, the industrial conglomerate, and a friend
of Lord King, criticised some of the airline's non-executive directors for
failing to fully support the chairman during the aftermath of the 'dirty
tricks' affair. The suggestion was refuted both by Sir Colin and by Lord
King. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said he would have
sacked the people involved in the 'dirty tricks' affair if he had been in
the government and BA had been a state-owned company.
'I think it is quite deplorable and a disgrace,' he said. 'The BA board is a
bit like the Tory cabinet - doesn't anyone resign any more when you get
caught out?'

FT  08 FEB 93 / AEEU hopeful on single-union deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE number of single-union agreements will increase if the electricians'
wing of the Amalagmated Engineering and Electrical Union rejoins the Trades
Union Congress in the autumn, according to AEEU leaders.
The leadership today launches its campaign to convince the union's 600,000
members to vote in favour of rejoining the TUC. A postal ballot will be held
next month.
Mr Paul Gallagher, general secretary of the electricians' section, says that
returning to the TUC after being expelled for defying rules five years ago
will provide 'great opportunities to negotiate more single-union
agreements'.
His union was at the forefront of the trend to single-union agreements that
peaked in the late 1980s. In forthcoming research to be published in the
Industrial Relations Journal, Mr Gregor Gall, a research student at
Manchester School of Management, says the old EETPU signed 66 of the 194
single-union deals he has found, followed by the engineering union with a
further 57 of them.
Mr Gall points out that 93 of the total deals were made between 1986 and
1989 with the largest number of 37 achieved in 1988. Only 14 more have been
signed since 1990. He argues that the sharp decline in such agreements after
1990 was mainly due to the recession and fall in new overseas investment,
particularly by Japanese companies who were at the forefront of the earlier
single-union deal wave.
But he argues an important secondary cause for the drop in interest in them
over the past four years stemmed from employer concern that signing new
style deals solely with the EETPU would destabilise their industrial
relations once the union was outside the TUC.
In a survey of 37 single-union agreements just published by Industrial
Relations Services it was found management favoured such deals because it
ensured they could achieve 'high levels of flexibility in the use of
labour'.
As many as 73 per cent of the companies surveyed said they had introduced
team-working as a result of having single-union agreements while 65 per cent
had 'adopted multi-skilling, where employees are required to undertake a
wide range of tasks without demarcation of any kind'.
Just over half reported they had introduced just-in-time production methods
and 62 per cent they operated total quality control.
The research also found that single-union deals brought single status for
workers in three quarters of the agreements, breaking down the old blue and
white-collar worker distinctions in terms and conditions of employment.
Joint consultation committees are also a feature of most single-union deals.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Rao shifts focus to economy
</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, who has been beset by the
problems of inter-religious violence for the past two months, yesterday
pledged to put economic reform back at the top of his agenda.
There had been a 'temporary slow-down' in reform as the government's
attention had been diverted by the unrest, the prime minister in a BBC
television phone-in programme.
But India was now making up for lost time. 'We have been concentrating even
more during the last fortnight on the economic agenda. This programme has
been taken up again with as much vigour as before. I have no doubt it will
come back with its original speed and urgency,' Mr Rao declared.
Mr Rao's remarks could raise hopes that the government's 1993-94 budget, due
at the end of this month, will contain further moves to deregulate the
economy and stimulate growth. The budget is widely expected to contain
further moves to liberalise foreign trade, including cuts in import duties.
Indian business is also lobbying for tax cuts. Mr Rao embarked on an
aggressive liberalisation programme in mid-1991, but has been accused of
allowing the reforms to slow down because of political difficulties last
summer.
During the television broadcast, the prime minister was repeatedly asked
about last year's destruction of the Ayodhya mosque by Hindu militants and
the violence which followed.
He declared that the worst was over but there was still tension in some
places, but they were 'few and far between'.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Malaysia widens markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEX NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIAN investment in China totalled about MDollars 2bn (Pounds 526m) last
year as industry sought to broaden its markets and reduce dependence on the
US, Europe and Japan, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister, said at
the weekend.
He said in London he was not concerned that a substantial flow of investment
into China might undermine investment in Malaysia's development. Falling
domestic investment was the result of a strategy to expand into new markets,
including China, Vietnam and Africa.
Mr Anwar hoped to bring down Malaysia's inflation this year to 4 per cent
from 4.7 per cent last; he would be comfortable with 7 per cent economic
growth as this would help to contain inflation.
But spending on infrastructure could push growth nearer to recent levels of
8-9 per cent, he said.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Bundesbank displays its economic juggling skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK'S struggle to balance its desire to achieve domestic price
stability against the rest of Europe's need for lower interest rates will
remain the most important political story in Europe this year. But the
Bundesbank is also engaged in a domestic economic balancing act which may
well determine the fate of the French franc and the length and depth of
Germany's looming recession.
The Bundesbank's tight monetary policy, whether or not it makes sense for
Germany, has undoubtedly been inappropriate for almost every other member of
the European exchange rate mechanism over the past year.
But the Bundesbank has, in fact, been quietly bowing to the pressure over
the past six months, despite the hawkish noises from Mr Helmut Schlesinger
and other members of the bank's governing council. Short-term German
interest rates have fallen by well over a percentage point from their peak
last autumn. The main function of last week's headline-grabbing cuts in the
discount and Lombard rates was to raise the public profile of the easing of
policy that has already occured over the last few months.
Whether or not they also signal that the Bundesbank is bowing to
international pressure will depend on whether the Bundesbank eases money
market rates faster over the coming months than domestic conditions warrant.
But, for France, even a faster rate of easing may not be enough. The French
problem, as the table demonstrates, is not simply that German interest rates
are too high but that the expectation of a Franc devaluation has caused the
risk premium in French short-term interest rates over German rates to triple
since last summer.
Yet the Bundesbank is not only under pressure from abroad. As the plight of
German industry has deepened, the Bundesbank has come under increasing
pressure from within Germany to lower German interest rates and thus reverse
the D-Mark appreciation of the past year. German industry has been in
recession since the middle of last year. West German industrial output fell
by 0.8 per cent last year, but by 5.1 per cent in November and December
compared with the same months in 1991. The weak performance of Germany's
export industries constrained the growth of gross national product to 0.8
per cent last year and GNP is expected to fall this year by up to 1 per
cent.
Yet while industry has been suffering, the Bundesbank has been struggling
with powerful inflationary pressures within western Germany. Gross domestic
product grew twice as fast as GNP last year and the annual inflation rate
has risen to 4.4 per cent in January. The reason for this German stagflation
 -falling output combined with rising inflation - is illustrated in the main
chart.
Sluggish international demand and the appreciation of the D-Mark have
prevented German industry from raising the price of industrial goods. The
annual rate of producer prices inflation has been falling steadily
throughout the last two years to less than  1/2 a per cent by the end of
last year. But the costs that industry face have risen much faster. Average
wages rose by 6 per cent in 1991 and by 5.4 per cent last year as the
combination of consumer spending and the growing fiscal deficit, 4.1 per
cent of GNP in 1992, have pushed service price inflation to over 6 per cent
a year.
The chart explains the Bundesbank's dilemma. Easing monetary policy now, and
allowing the D-Mark to depreciate, would fuel these domestic inflationary
pressures by pushing up producer price inflation. But the longer interest
rates must stay high to bring the domestic inflationary pressures under
control, the deeper the industrial recession. All which explains why the
Bundesbank has been so keen for the federal government to bring public
spending under control; and why last week's 3 per cent pay increase for
German public sector workers, announced on the same day as German headline
interest rates fell, was much the more important economic news for Europe.

MR Asif Ali Zardari, the husband of Pakistan's opposition leader, Ms Benazir
Bhutto, has been released on bail after spending over two years in prison on
charges including aiding an attempted kidnapping, writes Farhan Bokhari in
Lahore.
Mr Zardari's release is seen as part of an opposition-government
rapprochement in Pakistan, though both sides deny such moves.
Other recent indications included a government-backed nomination for Ms
Bhutto to chair the parliamentary committee on foreign relations.

<TEXT>
SEVEN Palestinians were shot dead and more than 70 wounded in the Israeli
occupied territories at the weekend, the latest convulsion in a spate of
violence that has undermined efforts to regenerate Middle East peace talks.
Left-wing ministers in the Labour-led coalition yesterday expressed concern
over a sharp rise in casualties in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Six people
were shot dead by troops in Gaza on Friday and Saturday, three when a
carload of armed men was intercepted and three in protests that followed.
One Palestinian was killed in Jerusalem last night.
They brought to 79 the number of Palestinians killed since the beginning of
October last year and 38 since the expulsion of more than 400 alleged
Islamic militants in mid-December. The figures include 10 children under 15.
Palestinian leaders have refused to accept a US-brokered compromise allowing
101 of the deportees to return as sufficient for resumption of peace talks.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Chung faces charges over election funds

MR Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai business group, has been indicted
on charges of illegal campaign funding and other alleged violations
connected with his failed candidacy in last December's South Korean
presidential election.
The indictment could force Mr Chung to leave politics if he is convicted,
and may weaken or dissolve the United People's party (UPP), the opposition
group he established one year ago today.
Prosecutors have conducted a highly-publicised investigation of Mr Chung's
election activities in what is considered a government warning to the
nation's large conglomerates against direct involvement in politics.
The 77-year-old Mr Chung is the first Korean industrial leader to enter
politics and challenge the government's tight control over business.
The indictment is the culmination of an 18-month feud between the government
and Mr Chung over his political activities.
His presidential campaign is alleged to have illegally received more than
Won50bn (Pounds 42.7m) from Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), the group's
shipbuilding unit.
The government began investigating Mr Chung shortly before the presidential
election on December 19 and the allegation contributed to his poor electoral
performance, in which he finished third to Mr Kim Young-sam of the ruling
Democratic Liberal party.
He is also charged with forcing Hyundai executives to work for the UPP and
making slanderous statements against Mr Kim. He was also accused of
beginning his campaign before the official period - campaigning is not
permitted until 28 days before the election. Meanwhile, prosecutors are
investigating allegations that HHI may have bribed government officials and
bank executives.
Both the UPP and the main opposition Democratic party charge that the
government investigation against Mr Chung is biased, as prosecutors are
ignoring complaints about alleged malpractices by the ruling party.
The indictment coincides with growing dissension within the UPP caused by
the party's poor showing.

FT  08 FEB 93 / France returns to Indochina stage: Mitterrand's visit is
aimed at restarting and opening up the Vietnamese economy - It will be the
first visit by a western head of state to a united Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand plans to combine business in Vietnam and
diplomacy in Cambodia during a five-day trip which will, according to his
spokesman, mark France's 'return to the Indochina stage.' Mr Mitterrand will
tomorrow arrive in Hanoi for the first visit by a French president, and the
first by a western head of state, to a united Vietnam.
Perhaps the most eye-catching occasion of his trip will be Wednesday's visit
to Dien Bien Phu, where French forces - now back to help the United Nations
keep peace in neighbouring Cambodia - surrendered to the Vietnamese after a
long battle in 1954. The visit to Dien Bien Phu threatened to raise tricky
protocol issues when it appeared that Mr Mitterrand's hosts envisaged the
French president paying homage to a Vietnamese war memorial there.
Such an action would have raised hackles in France, and the Elysee has since
made clear that Mr Mitterrand's motive in visiting the battlefield is
historical and apolitical. In any case, the president is unveiling a
memorial to the French veterans of Indochina in France a week later. His
main aim in Vietnam will be to help 'restart and open up the economy',
according to his spokesman, Mr Jean Musitelli. France is already the third
largest investor in Vietnam after Taiwan and Hong Kong.
Paris' intention to increase economic links will be underlined by the
presence of Mr Serge Tchuruk, president of the Total oil company, and other
French businessmen and bankers. Last week EMC, a French mining and chemical
company, said it had won permission to build a Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.2m)
cargo terminal on the Thi Vai river near Ho Chi Minh City.
France rapidly increased bilateral grants to Vietnam to FFr185m (Pounds
22.8m) last year, according to Mr Musitelli, who also stressed Paris'
support for Vietnam's re-entry into the IMF. France would continue to press
the US to be 'more realistic' and lift its veto on Vietnam's IMF
application. Vietnam's communist government, cast adrift by Moscow after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, is anxious to win new allies in Europe and the
US to counterbalance the commercial power of Japan and to help restrain
Chinese expansionism.
The Vietnamese and Cambodians, with no illusions about France's
international influence, are much less sentimental about the legacy of
French colonialism in Indochina.
Baguettes are still served in Hanoi and Phnom Penh cafes, but English rather
than French is the language of choice for businessmen and politicians.
The focus of Mr Mitterrand's trip to Cambodia, which begins on Thursday,
will be to support the peace process both by visiting the 2,800 French army
contingent in the UN force and by attempting to sort out the confusion over
a French-backed plan to have Prince Norodom Sihanouk elected president.
Prince Sihanouk, supported by France and Russia, wanted to become president
before a UN-organised general election in May, ostensibly so that he could
bring stability to Cambodia and mediate between the rival factions while a
new constitution was prepared.
The US, Britain and Australia at first opposed a presidential election,
arguing it was not mentioned in the comprehensive Paris peace accords of
1991 and could give Prince Sihanouk too much power; when they reluctantly
agreed, Prince Sihanouk suggested he might not want to stand after all.
French officials, accusing their western colleagues of lacking the necessary
subtlety to deal with the complexities of Cambodian politics, are still
backing the prince. 'For France, Prince Sihanouk is the best (presidential)
candidate, the man most likely to unite Cambodians and prepare a future
coalition government,' the Elysee official said. France co-chairs with Japan
an international committee to mobilise aid to Cambodia, and on a bilateral
basis gave FFr63m (Pounds 7.8m) in aid last year.

<TEXT>
SEVEN Palestinians were shot dead and more than 70 wounded in the Israeli
occupied territories at the weekend, the latest convulsion in a spate of
violence that has undermined efforts to regenerate Middle East peace talks.
Left-wing ministers in the Labour-led coalition yesterday expressed concern
over a sharp rise in casualties in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Six people
were shot dead by troops in Gaza on Friday and Saturday, three when a
carload of armed men was intercepted and three in protests that followed.
One Palestinian was killed in Jerusalem last night. They brought to 79 the
number of Palestinians killed since the beginning of October last year and
38 since the expulsion of more than 400 alleged Islamic militants in
mid-December.
The figures include 10 children under the age of 15. Thirteen Israelis have
died in the same period.
Palestinian leaders have refused to accept a US-brokered Israeli compromise
allowing 101 of the deportees to return as sufficient for resumption of
peace talks.
They are demanding the return of all deportees and an end to deportations.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, reiterated yesterday that Israel would
retain the use of expulsions 'in case of extraordinary situations'. The army
brought five ill deportees back to Israel yesterday from a Lebanese
hospital.
Two Palestinian reporters working for Reuters were arrested by Israeli
soldiers in Gaza yesterday while covering unrest.
Officials said the two, repeatedly arrested in the past, were suspected of
incitement, but their colleagues alleged harassment.

MR Asif Ali Zardari, the husband of Pakistan's opposition leader Ms Benazir
Bhutto, has been released on bail after spending over two years in prison
for charges including aiding an attempted kidnap, writes Farhan Bokhari in
Lahore.
Mr Zardari's release is widely viewed as part of an opposition-government
rapprochement in Pakistan, although both sides deny such moves.
Other recent indications included a government-backed nomination for Ms
Bhutto to chair the parliamentary committee on foreign relations.
Less than three months ago, Ms Bhutto led a public campaign to remove prime
minister Mr Nawaz Sharif's government on allegations of corruption.
Although she failed, many politicians conceded that Mr Sharif's effort to
liberalise the economy and was suffering from an image of a politically
unstable country.

<TEXT>
A SPATE of kidnappings and hijacks in Yemen has prompted the oil minister to
ask the biggest foreign oil company in the country to close down operations
for the safety of its foreign staff.
Mr Saleh Abu Bakr bin Hussainoun told executives of Hunt Oil, the US oil
group which pumps 170,000 barrels a day of Yemen's 200,000 b/d output, that
increasing lawlessness among some Yemeni tribes meant he could no longer
guarantee the safety of its 300 expatriate employees.
The oil minister's request follows an outbreak of gunpoint hold-ups of
expatriates in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, the kidnapping and release of a
Japanese expatriate and the abduction on January 24 of Mr Mike Schmitz, a
Canadian employee of Sterling Air Services.
However Hunt Oil said it would continue operating.
Mr Schmitz is still being held by a Yemeni tribe, apparently as a bargaining
chip in a land dispute with the government.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Malaysia broadens markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEX NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIAN investment in China totalled about MDollars 2bn (Pounds 526m) last
year as industry sought to broaden its markets and reduce dependence on the
US, Europe and Japan, Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister, said at
the weekend.
He said in London he was not concerned that a substantial flow of investment
into China might undermine investment in Malaysia's development. Falling
domestic investment was the result of a strategy to expand into new markets,
including China, Vietnam and Africa.
Mr Anwar said: 'I don't think this a source of concern or major worry. Is it
being done at the expense of investment domestically? The answer is no. Does
it actually affect in a small way investments locally? Yes. But we have not
taken any measures to curb or discourage investments overseas.'
In common with Chinese communities in other Asian countries, ethnic Chinese
companies and businessmen are looking to participate in the rapid growth of
China's economy.
'We encourage this trend. We want penetration into new markets. We want to
continue to have effective trading arrangements with China,' Mr Anwar said.
China was not competing for the type of investment which Malaysia was now
seeking, Mr Anwar said.
Mr Anwar said that he hoped to bring down inflation this year to 4 per cent
from 4.7 per cent last year, and that he would be comfortable with 7 per
cent economic growth as this would help to contain inflation. But spending
on infastructure could push growth nearer to recent levels of 8 to 9 per
cent.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Single Market Watch: Expectant hush in barrier-free
Community - Information is awaited on its progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is just over a month since the European Community abolished most of its
internal barriers to free movement of goods, people, capital and services,
and the single market is quiet - too quiet. 'At the moment it is a kingdom
of silence, but there will come a point when we will be overwhelmed by good
or maybe bad news,' said Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the new internal
market commissioner, last week.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi meets EC internal market ministers today in Brussels,
for the first time since the Community passed its January 1 deadline for a
barrier-free Europe. Everyone will be asking each other the same question:
how is it going? In theory, the proposed legislative work is almost done. Of
the 282 measures in the original 1985 single market programme, only 18 have
not been agreed. At the end of last month, member states had transferred an
average 72 per cent of the adopted measures into national law.
In practice, it is hard to tell how the market is working. Specific
complaints, particularly about continuing passport checks at internal
borders, have been notified to Brussels. But national officials responsible
for the single market had their first 'consultative' meeting last Tuesday
and concluded no evidence existed that free circulation of goods, services
and capital was being impeded.
That said, Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, 61, seeks to dispel the idea Brussels will
be pursuing a hands-off policy to the single market in the first half of
this year. A former senior Italian diplomat, he was clearly taken aback by
reaction to his first press conference last month, when he suggested an
'armistice or truce' on the single market.
His comments gave the impression there would be a three or four-month 'grace
period' in which the Commission would turn a blind eye to infringements of
the market's new rules, and even ignore governments which dragged their feet
on implementation of single market directives. As such, his stance was
roundly criticised by the European business community, relying on the
Commission to ensure governments transpose EC directives into national law
and enforce them.
But as he explained last week, this was not the signal he wanted to send.
'As far as transposition is concerned there will be no mercy.' The
commissioner says the first months of the market will be spent gathering
information, preparing a 'master plan' for enacting some of last year's
Sutherland committee recommendations on how to make the single market work.
The real test comes when genuine cross-border complaints start to feed back
through the EC network. Mr Peter Sutherland, the former commissioner who
headed the committee on implementation of the market, has warned member
states may try to abuse the principle of subsidiarity, by claiming that in
certain areas of the single market Brussels is tinkering with the
responsibilities of national governments.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi says Brussels will have no hesitation in following up
abuse of market rules. 'The Commission has to be guardian of the
construction (of the single market), here I'm referring to transposition of
directives in particular. The goal is not to be deliberately soft or strict;
the goal is to make sure the single market works.'
National representatives are trying to consolidate a network of contact
points to help people transmit difficulties with the new area of free
movement to the relevant authorities. Only when it comes to passport checks
is the new commissioner likely to be more cautious. He is sympathetic to the
problems member states have with lifting controls on travellers within the
EC, especially at airports, pointing out that architects of the single
market never forecast the increase in immigration from eastern Europe.
He wants to persuade member states to meet 'deadlines' of the end of June
for scrapping all controls on internal land borders, and the end of December
for ports and airports. As for Britain, which wants to retain passport
checks, he says: 'I will try not to let the division (between the UK and
continental member states) become greater.'

FT  08 FEB 93 / Japan ready to come out fighting: Tokyo's attitude to its
trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is braced for another potentially grim season of trade friction with
the US. But this time there will be a difference: Japan seems set to come
out fighting.
There is a growing feeling among senior Japanese trade officials that the
issue of Japan's trade surplus with the US needs a fundamentally different
approach. It is an approach which could well be at odds with that of the
Clinton administration.
The US and Japan have a long history of trade talks to draw lessons from -
from the initial measures to open the Japanese market to leather and tobacco
imports in the late 1970s to the elaborate Structural Impediments Initiative
in the late 1980s.
The lesson drawn by some senior officials in the Clinton administration,
such as Ms Laura Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers,
is that there should be a renewed drive to open up specific Japanese
industries to competition. The Japanese want to go in the opposite
direction. Japanese officials reject an industry-by-industry approach.
Instead they want to focus on the macro-economic causes of the trade
imbalance, primarily Japan's sluggish demand for imports and the US fiscal
deficit.
This difference is not new. But what is unusual is the assertiveness with
which Japanese officials are prepared to defend it. As director-general of
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's international trade
policy bureau, Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu is one of the most senior bureaucrats to
express publicly Japan's unhappiness with the market-specific approach
favoured by the US.
He argues that an attempt to correct the trade imbalance by insisting that
US companies ought to attain a certain share of specific markets in Japan is
not the right solution. If the US insisted on such an approach, the Japanese
would talk, but with little enthusiasm. Mr Okamatsu said: 'We completely
reject that sort of approach to set some market share. We do not want to
proceed down that road.' He is careful not to label the new Clinton
administration 'protectionist'. The imposition of US anti-dumping duties on
steel imports, he says, was a procedure rather than a sign of US policy
thinking. With only a handful of key US posts filled, it was too early to
tell what the administration's approach will be.
Nevertheless, as protectionist pressures mount on the Clinton
administration, and with legislation before Congress to raise import duties
on minivans and revive the Super 301 trade sanctions, Mr Okamatsu admits:
'Right now we have great concerns about the new administration in the US.'
Japan's response to such measures would be more assertive than in the past,
Mr Okamatsu indicated. If Super 301 was invoked to impose uniltaeral
sanctions against Japanese exports to the US, Japan would retaliate. Japan
would first seek a Gatt ruling on the Super 301 provisions and, if Gatt
ruled in its favour, would withdraw tariff and tax concessions to US
imports.
As an alternative, Japan will propose a primarily macro-economic approach,
with four main components:
Later this year the Japanese government will introduce an emergency spending
package to stimulate the economy and boost imports.
Japan will help foreign businesses to promote imports more vigorously.
The government is planning to ease the recycling of Japan's export earnings
through higher overseas development aid and support for investment overseas
by Japanese companies. The target will be more than Dollars 50bn over the
next five years.
Persuade the US to address its macro-economic position, particularly its
fiscal deficit. 'We have asked the US, via the SII talks, to change the
fiscal position.' Mr Okamatsu said. 'But the situation is getting worse and
worse, and so it is impossible to affect the trade imbalance.'
He adds: 'Resolution of the trade issue should be through mutual efforts.'
Although Mr Okamatsu is too polite to say so outright, the underlying
message is that, so far, it has been a one-sided affair.
Certainly, US-Japan trade relations have appeared to consist primarily of
fire-fighting exercises. 'The Japanese government is tired of asking the
same things from the US that it has been asking for three or four years. In
that sense we want a new approach,' Mr Okamatsu says. To break the sense of
deadlock, Japan was likely to suggest that the long-running SII talks should
be revamped. 'They became much more detailed than we expected,' he says. 'We
wanted them to focus over larger structural issues.'
Mr Okamatsu favours setting up a bi-partisan panel of experts to address the
trade imbalance. Only if that were to conclude that importers into Japan
faced obstacles in specific sectors would there be a case for more detailed
talks.
Japan also wants its talks with the US on the bilateral trade relationship
to take place in the context of discussions on global issues such as
measures to stimulate the world economy.
It may be wishful thinking for the Japanese to hope the US will adopt the
kind of approach Japan is likely to propose. Tokyo's new found assertiveness
over trade policy is certainly an attempt to influence the shaping of the
Clinton administration's policy. But it could be more than simply a signal.
If the US does propose an industry-by-industry approach to trade talks, this
could be met with a much firmer response than before.

FT  08 FEB 93 / White House rebuffs EC on Gatt talks timetable: Blow to
Brittan's hopes of early decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLINTON administration has rebuffed European Community overtures seeking
agreement on a timetable for reaching an early conclusion of the Uruguay
Round of global trade talks.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, made the soundings in advance of
this Thursday's opening round of bilateral trade talks in Washington with Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative. Mr Kantor's response was
non-committal, on the grounds that the new administration is still
formulating policy, and therefore a blow to Sir Leon's attempts to convey a
sense of urgency towards concluding the six-year-old Gatt talks.
Last week, Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, further dampened
prospects for a rapid Gatt deal when he said that a breakthrough was
unlikely to occur before March 1, the deadline for the US 'fast track'
negotiating authority.
Brussels officials say Sir Leon was looking for a commitment that Mr Clinton
would seek, if necessary, a three-to-six-month extension to the 'fast track'
negotiating authority, allowing the administration to offer Congress a Gatt
deal for approval or rejection without amendment.
Without such a tight negotiating framework, the risks increase of an
agreement being delayed until next year or later, an EC official familiar
with Sir Leon's thinking said. After the initial rebuff, EC officials have
now downgraded expectations of what can be achieved at the first meeting
between Sir Leon and Mr Kantor, beyond 'getting the chemistry right' and
ensuring that the administration makes a Gatt agreement a top priority.
Beyond talks with Mr Kantor, Sir Leon is to meet Mr Robert Rubin, an old
Yale colleague who is special assistant to the president on economic policy,
as well as members of Congress, and possibly Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury
Secretary. The two sides must also address two separate trade disputes
which, while inherited from the Bush administration, have again flared up
since Mr Clinton took office.
Relations soured after the Clinton administration's preliminary decision to
impose new anti-dumping duties on steel exports from the EC and other
countries.  Last week, the administration said the federal government would
stop buying goods and services from EC countries unless the EC ended
discrimination in public procurement contracts.
EC officials fear these bilateral disputes are best contained in the Gatt
framework, but without early agreement, they could spin out of control.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Italy reduces banks' reserve requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government has lowered the proportion of funds commercial banks
have to deposit with the Bank of Italy, in a further attempt to reduce the
country's high borrowing costs.
However, the decision to cut obligatory reserve requirements was greeted
cautiously by bankers at the weekend, amid warnings that interest rates
would not come down immediately.
The move lowers to an average 17.5 per cent from 22.5 per cent the
proportion of deposits and short-term certificates of deposit commercial
banks have to place with the central bank. The reserve requirement is one of
the highest in the western world, and has often been blamed for contributing
to Italy's high interest rates and low bank profits.
The move, long sought by bankers, follows last week's 0.5 percentage point
cut to 11.5 per cent in the Bank of Italy's discount rate, and is a further
response to growing recessionary pressures in the economy. As unemployment
rises, industrialists have been demanding lower interest rates to stop
output being stifled. The decision to cut reserve requirements, under
discussion for some time, follows a similar move by Germany last month.
The cut in the reserve requirement will create about L15,000bn (Pounds
6.7bn) in additional liquidity for commercial banks. A further L5,000bn
should be freed by mid-March as a result of a reduction to 10 per cent from
22.5 per cent in the proportion of funds which banks raise from certificates
of deposit of over 18 months' maturity and place with the Bank of Italy.

The centrist Fatherland Union (VU) won 11 seats, the right-wing Progressive
Citizens Party (FBP) 12 seats and the Free List (FL) two seats in the
25-member parliament, the Swiss news agency said.
The FBP will now head the coalition government and its candidate, Mr Markus
Buechel, will replace the VU's Mr Hans Brunhart as head of government.
The election was fought over constitutional issues and Liechtenstein's
membership of the 18-state European Economic Area. All three parties favour
membership but differ on how to deal with the influx of foreigners that
participation will bring with it.
Liechtenstein's 14,000 electorate voted for membership in December.

FT  08 FEB 93 / More cautious approach by new EC environment commissioner
</HEADLINE>

'CONTROLLING carbon dioxide is a very long-term project - it will certainly
not be finished by the end of the year. Beyond that it is hard to guess what
happens,' says Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the new EC environment commissioner.
Mr Paleokrassas describes this judgment as 'realistic', but it is likely to
be controversial. Proposals for a combined carbon and energy tax to combat
the threat of global warming are among the most ambitious and
well-publicised of EC environmental policies. There is also a view that the
appointment of the former Greek finance minister is a signal of downgrading
the importance of environmental issues within the European Community.
While he rejects that view, his cautious approach contrasts with that of his
best-known predecessor, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, who was credited with
putting environment policy on the EC map.
The commission is looking at ways of rebalancing the proposed carbon and
energy tax so it falls more heavily on transport and less on energy
generation than early versions.
However, the main obstacle the proposals face is the condition that other
industrialised countries must take similar steps, although Mr Paleokrassas
is 'encouraged' by statements from the new US administration and from a
recent high-level Japanese visit to Brussels. Because of the difficulties,
he says he would be happy to see a long-term place for nuclear power, which
does not emit carbon dioxide, along with greater use of natural gas.
He acknowledges too some of the problems of enforcing the 200-odd
environmental directives enthusiastically passed by Brussels in the past two
decades. The new standards on drinking and bathing water are proving
particularly expensive for some countries to meet: UK water companies say
that around half of their present Pounds 45bn (Dollars 68bn) investment
programme is prompted by the EC rules.
To help poorer countries comply he wants to turn to the new cohesion fund
created by the Maastricht treaty, intended to help Spain, Ireland, Portugal
and Greece to fill in missing 'links' in European transport networks and to
meet EC environmental standards. However, those countries have so far shown
more interest in using the money to build roads - a further environmental
headache, as transport emissions are already the fastest growing type of air
pollution.
He is resigned to the environment getting the smaller share of the cohesion
fund: 'If 30 per cent (of the fund) went purely to environment I would be
happy.' Even that share - which some believe is unlikely - is a small sum:
only Ecu5bn (Dollars 6.2bn) spread over seven years.
He is optimistic, however, about some of the lower-profile EC projects such
as eco-labelling and eco-auditing, arguing that 'these make it profitable
for industry to promote the environment', and that eventually 'environmental
businesses may provide a stimulus to growth'.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Interest rates may fall, Madrid suggests
</HEADLINE>

   By PETER BRUCE

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish government has hinted that official interest rates in the
country may fall in the next few days following the reduction in German
interest rates last week.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, said at the weekend that while it was
up to the Bank of Spain to decide whether to trim its official intervention
rate from 13.25 per cent this week, sharp falls in Spanish interbank rates
after the German cuts meant the market was already discounting a Spanish
cut.
The government, under pressure in this election year to stimulate an
economic recovery, would welcome any help from the Bank of Spain.
Mr Solchaga announced at the weekend that the economy had grown just 1.2 per
cent last year. The minister believes that, at best, gross domestic product
will grow 1 per cent in 1993.
He said unemployment had risen from 16.3 per cent to 18.2 per cent last
year, badly missing the target in Spain's plan to converge its economy with
leading countries of the European Community. The plan had aimed at GDP
growth of 3 per cent for 1992.
Despite sniping from political critics, however, the government believes it
has a real chance of ending this year with a recovery under way.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Spain's new generation seeks power: Conservative opposition
leader Jose Maria Aznar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE opposition leader, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, 39, dismisses Socialist
Prime Minister Mr Felipe Gonzalez, 50 next month, as an old man.
'It is my generation's turn,' says Mr Aznar, who was re-elected leader of
the opposition Partido Popular yesterday at its keynote national convention
in Madrid on Friday.
Months ago such remarks by the slightly built Mr Aznar, who will lead his
party into elections before the year is out, prompted derision. It was
unthinkable that the personable Mr Gonzalez, in power since 1982 and a
European statesman of stature, could be challenged by the likes of him.
But with the economy stagnant and the ruling Socialists buffeted by
corruption scandals and divided internally, Spanish voters are less
enthusiastic about Mr Gonzalez than they were.
The latest opinion poll puts Mr Aznar's party just 3.5 points behind the
Socialists, with 33.2 per cent of the vote against 36.7 per cent. In the
1989 elections, the PP trailed the Socialists by 14 points.
Mr Aznar, who has led the PP since April 1990, says that the weekend's
congress in Madrid will mark the 'transformation of the centre-right in
Spain'.
In less than three years the patriarchs of the Spanish right, most of whom
shared uncomfortable Francoist backgrounds, have been pensioned off, and Mr
Aznar runs the PP with a circle of loyalists in their 30s.
Mr Aznar has jettisoned the paternalism and the liking for state
intervention which marked the Franco period and which formed the basis of
conservative thinking when democracy returned.
Mr Aznar says the party has undergone an 'ideological renovation' and been
brought round to market-driven economics. He believes Spain's centre-right
has fashioned a modern programme for change and market-oriented policies
will help pull the economy round.
The 2,800 party delegates will this weekend endorse policy calling for
deregulation and privatisation. Previous conservative electioneering was
largely confined to calls for law and order and to warnings that national
unity was threatened by separatists.
The PP's emphasis on the economy and its pledges to reduce interest rates
come as lay-offs and receiverships dominate the news. Mr Aznar, a tax
inspector by profession, is also promising a tax freeze before an overhaul
of the taxation system, with changes to capital gains tax and death duties
among others.
Once seen as the representatives of the old order and encased in nostalgia,
the conservatives under Mr Aznar are bidding to take the banner of change
and modernity from the Socialists.
'PP voters are mostly young, independent and urban dwellers,' says Mr Aznar.
He charges that the Socialists are backed by the rural areas, by those with
little access to information and by those dependent on the state such as
pensioners, the unemployed and public-sector workers.
'The socialists cannot modernise Spain with that sort of constituency.'
General elections are not likely until October, but Mr Aznar has been
campaigning for months. 'With every trip I become more convinced that Spain
is on the threshold of an important change.
'People are feeling very low and disillusioned, they are calling out for
something different.'

FT  08 FEB 93 / Nation awaits an administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE months after winning the US election, President Bill Clinton is still
struggling in his attempts to install an administration in Washington.
The elimination of Judge Kimba Wood on Friday night as a candidate for the
post of attorney general has left the Justice Department - arguably one of
the federal departments most in need of renewed leadership - rudderless.
And although all of Mr Clinton's other cabinet secretaries have won
confirmation from the Senate and started work at their departments, only
three of the 14 deputy secretaries have been confirmed - and these, at
State, Treasury and Veterans' Affairs, are the only deputies selected by Mr
Clinton and announced at the same time as their cabinet superiors.
At the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Health and Human Services,
Interior and Justice, no deputy secretary has even been nominated.
Candidates for these positions, as well as appointees who have already been
confirmed, will now face additional scrutiny over whether they ever employed
an illegal alien in their households, or neglected to pay the appropriate
social security taxes - an obligation for an employee paid over Dollars 50
in a quarter.
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown acknowledged yesterday that he had failed to
pay social security taxes for a cleaner, and two candidates for governor of
New Jersey have been torpedoed by the 'nanny question', which seems likely
to replace youthful marijuana smoking as the most fashionable test for
political fitness.
Vice-President Al Gore, trade representative Mickey Kantor and Texas Senator
Phil Gramm, a likely candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in
1996, all denied yesterday they had any problems with domestic help.
New US administrations are always beset in their early months with tales of
disarray as they attempt to fill the 9,100 federal positions open to
political appointees, including 600-800 posts with significant policy-making
roles.
It is no surprise that the Democrats, returning to power after 12 years out
of office, have faced the same problems.
This is little consolation, however, for the businesses, agencies, foreign
governments and citizens who have to deal with an administration operating
on autopilot.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Serbs blamed for attack on German relief aircraft
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Nations officials last night claimed that anti-aircraft fire which
hit a German relief aircraft over Croatia on Saturday came from Serb forces,
Ariane Genillard in Bonn and agencies report.
The UN has protested to Serb authorities at the incident and the German
Defence Ministry said Germany would halt all relief flights to Sarajevo  -
where the aircraft was bound - until further notice. Mr Volker Ruhe, defence
minister, will consider resuming aid flights only after examining a report
from German experts, who returned yesterday from the Croatian capital
Zagreb.
The German flight from Zagreb was shot at over the Croatian town of Karlovac
but landed safely. One crew member was injured.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said a UN airlift of humanitarian
supplies to Sarajevo would resume today. Flights would leave from Split, on
Croatia's Adriatic coast, and US bases in Germany.
Laura Silber, in Zagreb, adds: Croatia is calling for Nato forces to back up
the 14,000-strong UN Protection Force in disputed Serb enclaves of Croatia,
whose one-year mandate expires on February 20.
A Croatian document issued on February 3 states: 'Croatia suggests that in
the near future UN forces on the territory of the republic of Croatia should
be assisted by Nato naval and air forces, whose major task should be to
provide air cover and essential and logistical support.'
The proposals reflect Croatia's exasperation with its failure to gain
control over more than one-quarter of Croatian territory. Serb militias have
refused to disband, in violation of the UN plan.
But the revised plan also reveals Croatia's backing of a military option -
rather than a political solution - following its first military offensive
across UN lines.
As 3.6m Croats were due to cast their ballots in municipal elections,
Croatian and Serb rebel forces yesterday exchanged artillery and rocket fire
in the Dalmatian hinterland near Zadar, the Adriatic port.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Bosnia mediators hope for US backing: Washington now appears
to favour a negotiated solution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, MUNICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL mediators working for a peace settlement in Bosnia are
heartened by signals from Washington that the new US administration may be
prepared to back a modified version of their plan rather than rejecting it
altogether.
Having criticised the plan drawn up by Mr Cyrus Vance, representing the
United Nations, and Lord Owen, the European Community's representative, for
supposedly failing to guarantee the Bosnian Moslems' rights, President Bill
Clinton is due to announce the US's own proposals this week.
However, the mediators believe there is now much more common ground between
them and the US than at first appeared. They are particularly relieved by
indications that Washington appears to have abandoned any idea of direct
military intervention in Bosnia and has come round to a negotiated solution,
albeit one that could be backed up by force if necessary. The US policy
rethink was 'going in an encouraging direction', a British official said
yesterday.
One of the main reservations about the Vance-Owen plan expressed in
Washington, other than that it 'rewards' the Bosnian Serbs for their policy
of ethnic cleansing, is that even if it is signed by all the warring
parties, there are not sufficient guarantees that it will be properly
implemented.
That reservation has been taken on board by the mediators, who would welcome
suggestions from the US on how the implementation of the plan, particularly
the control of heavy weapons, could be given more teeth. In his talks with
the mediators over the week-end, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Moslem
foreign minister, again underlined the need for an effective weapons control
system.
Among the proposals under discussion, both at the UN in New York and in
Washington, are the use of air power to destroy artillery and other heavy
weapons that any of the warring parties refuse to place under UN
supervision. Such operations could be organised by Nato's air command,
although formally under the UN umbrella. It is also clear that, if the US
plan is to be taken seriously, it would have to be backed up by the promise
of ground troops to help in the peacekeeping and peace enforcement
operations.
One of the main criticisms of US policy on the Bosnian conflict voiced at
the UN is that it has been big on words and short on concrete contributions
to peacekeeping operations.
The use of Nato as a surrogate for the UN would be designed to meet
traditional American objections to placing US troops under UN command.
Mr Les Aspin, US secretary of defence, confirmed yesterday at the annual
Munich security conference in Germany that the US believed Nato had a role
to play.
'Europe and the alliance are not secure if we fail to bring the full force
of our influence to bear in contributing to a restoration of peace,' he
said. Another proposal reportedly being discussed is an international
tribunal to try war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, which would be welcomed
by the mediators.
When Lord Owen first made such a proposal at the meeting of the enlarged
steering committee of the Yugoslav peace conference in Geneva last December,
none of the 32 foreign ministers present formally endorsed it.
Before submitting their plan to the Security Council today, the mediators
attempted to persuade, without success, one or two of the warring parties to
give up to the Bosnian Moslems some of the territory allocated to them under
the plan to divide the country into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. The
Moslems, for their part, continued to reject the proposed map, in the
knowledge that they could count on the US administration's support.
The Security Council's meeting today will take the form of informal
consultations. Apart from the US, all other permanent members of the Council
(Russia, China, Britain and France) support the Vance-Owen plan. But among
the non-permanent members, three Islamic states, Pakistan, Morocco and
Djibouti, are opposed.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said yesterday he hoped
Moscow could persuade Washington to support the Vance-Owen plan.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Japan signals tougher stance over trade talks with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is ready to take a much firmer stance in trade talks with the US if
the Clinton administration insists on an industry-by-industry approach to
cutting Tokyo's Dollars 43bn (Pounds 28bn) trade surplus with the US.
The tougher line, spelt out by a senior official at the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry at the weekend, could signal growing
friction with the US, where several members of the administration's economic
team favour a sectoral approach to opening up the Japanese market.
Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, director general of Miti's international trade policy
bureau and one of Japan's most senior trade negotiators, said the country
wanted a more equal partnership with the US. The two countries had to
address the trade issue in the context of wider concerns, such as
stimulating world economic growth.
'We completely reject the sort of approach to set some market share for
imports into Japan. We do not want to proceed down that road,' he said.
Japan wanted a more macro-economic approach to the trade issue.
This conflicts with recent remarks by Ms Laura Tyson, chairman of President
Bill Clinton's council of economic advisers, in favour of sectoral talks on
the surplus.
If the US wanted to propose micro-economic talks, Japan would co-operate,
but it was not the route preferred by Tokyo and it would be embarked upon
with little enthusiasm.
Mr Okamatsu also spelt out earlier threats that Japan would retaliate
against any unilateral trade sanctions imposed under the so-called Super 301
provisions of the US 1988 trade act. A bill proposing the revival of the
provisions was presented to the US Congress last week, as well as a bill to
raise sharply the tariff on mini-van imports.
Mr Okamatsu said Japan would first seek a ruling from the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, the world trade body, on any Super 301 measures
against its exporters. If Gatt ruled in Japan's favour, Japan would consider
withdrawing tax and tariff concessions on US imports into the country.
Japan's global trade surplus has grown rapidly in the past two years,
largely because the slowdown in its economy has cut demand for imports. The
global surplus surged by 37.6 per cent last year to Dollars 107.06bn.
Mr Okamatsu said Japan was keen to continue with the macro-economic aspects
of the long-running US Structural Impediments Initiative - designed to
remove structural obstacles to trade - as they looked at the 'total
picture'.
But it preferred not to pursue the detailed sector by sector talks which
have focused on Japanese business practices which US companies allege block
imports.
Mr Okamatsu said Japan would take further measures to stimulate demand for
imports.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Smith clears ground for rethink of Labour aims: Vision of
party's 'new politics'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH yesterday cleared the ground for Labour's objectives to be
reworked by projecting the party as a non-ideological champion of ordinary
citizens' interests.
In a keynote speech to Labour's local government conference at Bournemouth,
Mr Smith avoided a confrontation with the party's trade union elite. At the
same time he signalled that policy dogmas such as state ownership and
redistributive taxation were no longer central to its aims.
'What we need is a new political approach for a new political era. A new
politics that puts people first, that rejects dogma and embraces practical,
common-sense solutions,' he said.
Senior party officials said Mr Smith's 37-minute address was intended to be
the springboard for a wide-ranging assault on long-established 'shibboleths'
which will begin in a full-day shadow cabinet meeting in London next Monday.
It will be followed by as many as seven further addresses by Mr Smith before
the end of May.
The opposition leader's goal is to capture the political centre-ground by
portraying Labour as the advocate of 'pragmatic and practical' change and
the Conservatives as the party of entrenched elites and vested interests.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, will press home the attack in a
speech on vested interests this week. Later this month he is due to flesh
out Mr Smith's pledge of a 'framework for investment'. This is intended to
use regulation to improve competition, set standards and enforce workplace
rights as a substitute for state ownership.
Throughout his speech, Mr Smith avoided references to socialism and
equality. Instead he stressed government's duty to devise a long-term
strategy to invest in skills and training as 'the building blocks for
individual and national prosperity'.
He promised to provide an 'infrastructure of opportunity' to allow people to
raise their earning power. 'Our task is to stand again and again for the
frustrated ambitions of the majority of our people.'
His frequent references to the need for change will be taken as a tacit
endorsement of Labour's 'moderniser' faction at the expense of party
traditionalists. Earlier yesterday, Mr John Edmonds, influential leader of
the GMB general union, appeared to endorse the strategy by welcoming 'the
age of ambition' as representing the decent demands of ordinary people.
However, Mr Tony Benn, the veteran Labour MP, later derided Mr Smith's
approach as 'the repudiation of socialism', intended to prepare the party
for joining a national coalition.
In one passage in his speech, the Labour leader appeared to offer a critique
of past party policy as a 'failure of dogma'. He said: 'The political debate
in Britain has been bedevilled for too long by simplistic argument and false
choices. The truth is that we need both dynamic markets and active
government.'
Instead of the 'largely sterile debate' about the ownership of industry and
services, he said, Labour saw both the need for a mixed economy and an
'active and creative partnership' between the public and private sectors.
Endorsing a bill of rights, and a freedom of information act, he said the
goal of democratic socialism was a 'radical theory of citizenship in which
access by all to the power of knowledge is the foundation of liberty'.

FT  08 FEB 93 / EC steelmakers braced for cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S steel industry has indicated it is willing to discuss new
far-reaching cuts in capacity as part of a future EC rescue plan, according
to a report ordered by the European Commission.
The report by Mr Fernand Braun, the EC's special steel envoy, shows that the
deepening recession and mounting losses have forced steel producers to raise
estimates of possible capacity cuts well beyond those set out just a month
ago.
Mr Braun's report will form the starting point for discussions between the
Commission and EC industry ministers, who later this month must decide how
much political, financial and commercial support to extend to EC steel
producers facing their worst crisis in 10 years.
The Commission has proposed spending more than Pounds 700m on helping
steelmakers to shut excess capacity, but much depends on the credibility of
the industry's commitment to joining an industry-wide restructuring exercise
led by Brussels.
After more than three months of talks with about 70 managing directors of EC
steel producers, Mr Braun has extracted information which adds up to
'potential' and 'probable' cuts in capacity of around 17m tonnes in crude
steel and around 11m tonnes in rolled products.
These figures come on top of firm industry pledges to reduce capacity by
around 8.5m tonnes of crude steel and 6.6m tonnes of rolled steel which
appeared in an interim report that Mr Braun sent to the Commission last
month. At least 50,000 jobs are likely to go.
The interim report was criticised within the industry because it failed to
secure actual agreements from steelmakers to reduce some of the 30m tonnes
of production overcapacity in the EC. Mr Braun is believed subsequently to
have persuaded steelmakers to be more explicit about their restructuring
plans. These figures are based on discussions within the industry and the
likelihood that steelmakers face little hope of an upturn.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, has pressed member states to
consider granting a more generous market share for eastern European
exporters, beyond the current 5 per cent.
He would also like to see a more restrained approach to anti-dumping against
the former communist countries, although EC steelmakers say cheap imports
are driving up losses.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Chinese students turn from Marxism to business
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE People's University of China is abandoning courses in Marxism in favour
of business studies.
The Beijing-based university, bowing to the pressures of China's economic
reforms, is introducing courses in such capitalist pursuits as real estate
management and marketing.
Some 14 new business subjects will be made available at the university,
established by the Communist party to train young revolutionaries before the
People's Republic was founded in 1949.
According to China's Business Weekly, the new subjects will replace 17
courses related to communist dogma that have died through lack of student
interest.
China's Community Party School, the main centre for training high-level
party cadres, is also joining in by announcing that for the first time it
will begin teaching China's leaders about stock market operations.
This coincides with an explosion of interest throughout China as people,
starved of investment opportunities for so long, seek better returns for
their savings.
Party school courses in the rudiments of capital markets also come at a time
when China's State Council (cabinet) is considering a new securities law to
help regulate the country's growing equities markets in such places as the
Shenzen special economic zone in South China and in Shanghai. The Communist
party newspaper, People's Daily, said reform of the party school's
curriculum was necessary to deal with practical developments after calls
last year by Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, for swifter market
reforms. Deng's call helped prompt an explosion of economic activity
throughout the country with annual growth rates in some places exceeding 12
per cent. This rapid growth is causing disquiet and has led to calls for a
slowdown to prevent the economy overheating.
The People's University, a hotbed of Red Guard activity after Mao Zedong
launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966, has been finding it increasingly
hard to attract students to its outmoded disciplines. Bright young Chinese,
who would have fought to gain entry to the People's University, now stream
south to make their fortunes in the new economic zones, or drift towards
institutions offering more business-related courses. Revealingly, the
People's University is establishing a department of national economic
management to replace the planned economy department.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Whitehall fails to keep its numbers in check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROGRESS Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher made in cutting the number
of civil servants is being reversed under Mr John Major. The total is rising
again, despite the search for public expenditure cuts.
There were more than 565,000 civil servants in April 1992, according to
recently released Treasury statistics, a net increase of almost 11,500 on
the previous year.
While the number of white-collar civil servants rose by more than 14,000 the
overall increase in the Civil Service was slightly less because of
continuing cuts among blue-collar civil servants, whose numbers have been
halved since 1984. The overall white-collar figure has returned to the 1984
level of 500,000.
Mrs Ann Robinson, head of the policy unit at the Institute of Directors,
said the figures reflected the government's failure to get to grips with the
size of the public services payroll.
'If the chancellor is going to reduce public spending to curb the budget
deficit, he has no alternative but to look at the number of people employed
in the public services,' she said.
While some departments such as Trade and Industry have cut white-collar
payrolls, others such as the Home Office and Social Security Department have
grown.
A variety of reasons is given for the growth:
The Lord Chancellor's Department, with a 17 per cent increase in its
white-collar payroll since the start of 1980, blames a heavier civil and
criminal justice workload.
The Home Office, which has increased white-collar staff from under 30,000 to
more than 46,000 in the same period, cites prison service expansion and
increasing immigration work.
The rapid increase in unemployment in the past two years has fuelled a 27
per cent jump in the number of civil servants in the Employment Service.
The executive agencies which are supposed to impose business disciplines on
government services are responsible for much of the increase in the number
of civil servants. Of the 28 oldest agencies, 21 have increased staff totals
since inception.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Keating calls Australianpoll three months early: Labor move
seeks to exploit rise in popularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILIA TAGAZA

   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, yesterday called a federal
election on March 13 after his Labor party lost a state election in Western
Australia by a smaller than expected margin.
By choosing to go to the electorate three months earlier than he had to, Mr
Keating is seeking to capitalise on Labor's rise in popularity since he
wrested the premiership from Mr Bob Hawke in December 1991. A Morgan Gallup
poll, to be published in Time Australia magazine today, indicated that Labor
would win by 5 per cent if the election were held now.
The announcement launched a fierce political and personal battle. Mr
Keating, 49, was treasurer for eight years as Australia sank into its
deepest recession since the 1930s. He is famous for vicious criticism of his
opponents.
Mr John Hewson, the 47-year-old leader of the coalition of opposition
conservative parties, is an economist who loves sports cars. The two men are
known to detest each other.
In Western Australia, a scandal-ridden Labor state government, expected to
lose by a landslide in Saturday's poll, suffered only a 5 per cent swing
against it, with the opposition coalition increasing its share of the vote
by just 2 per cent. It was the third time in a year that a Labor government
had been unseated in a state election.
Mr Hewson said he could win the federal election because the Western
Australian poll showed middle-class Australians deserting Labor. 'I think
with nearly a million Australians unemployed and millions of others
genuinely worried about whether or not they'll keep their job, the issue is
going to be who is best able to manage this country,' he said.
Australia's economy, which has begun to turn upwards, boasts an inflation
rate of only 0.3 per cent but unemployment at 11.3 per cent.
Mr Keating said he would tomorrow announce a policy package designed to
expand business opportunities and accelerate growth. Today he will outline a
strategy to take advantage of trade opportunities in Asia.
Mr Hewson's economic strategy is centred on a value-added tax on
consumption. Although it would be offset by income tax cuts, the VAT
proposal has become the main target of government counter-attacks.
Mr Keating, whose policy as treasurer was to liberalise the economy by
floating the currency and cutting tariffs and taxes, has sought to refocus
Australia on its role in Asia and favours moves to lessen traditional ties
with Britain. He warned voters that a conservative win would threaten the
national health system.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Reichmann and top investor plan US property venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Paul Reichmann, the man at the centre of the world's most spectacular
property company collapse, is to advise Mr George Soros, one of the world's
most successful money managers, on the real estate market as the two join
forces to invest in north American commercial property.
Mr Soros, a Hungarian-born Wall Street investor, made more than Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) speculating against sterling on 'Black Wednesday' last autumn.
Toronto-based Mr Reichmann built Olympia &amp; York into the world's biggest
property developer in the 1970s and 1980s, only to see its main Canadian
business file for bankruptcy court protection from creditors last May.
Canary Wharf, O&amp;Y's development in London's Docklands, has been in the care
of administrators since then. The deal represents a remarkable vote of
confidence in Mr Reichmann, who was praised by Mr Soros yesterday as 'one of
the most astute and visionary figures in real estate investment'.
The Soros-Reichmann partnership, to be formally announced today, follows
last Friday's approval by an Ontario court for O&amp;Y to emerge from bankruptcy
protection, albeit as a shadow of its former self.
Mr Reichmann, who will have no executive relationship with the ongoing O&amp;Y,
is setting up a new company, Reichmann International, which will provide
advisory services on property matters to Soros Fund Management, Mr Soros's
private investment management firm. This already has in-house property
experts.
Mr Soros is establishing a new fund, Quantum Realty, which plans to raise up
to Dollars 525m to invest in property, with up to another Dollars 130m
available from Soros-related co-investors. Mr Soros and Mr Reichmann, as the
representative of the Reichmann family, will jointly contribute Dollars
75m-Dollars 100m to Quantum Realty.
Much of the remainder seems likely to come from investors in Mr Soros'
existing, Netherlands Antilles-based funds, who have the option to plough
back more than Dollars 1bn of 1992 fund profits into new Soros investment
vehicles.
The deal is also significant because of the interest Mr Soros is displaying
in the north American property market, severely depressed for two years.
Mr Soros said he believed now was a time of 'great opportunity to begin to
assemble a prime portfolio of commercial real estate at advantageous
prices'.

FT  08 FEB 93 / BR to consider cut-price tunnel link: Ministers order review
of route through London to Channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS have ordered British Rail to consider a cut-price option for the
long-delayed Channel tunnel rail link that could reduce the cost from Pounds
4.5bn to less than Pounds 2bn.
A significant part of the saving would come from adopting proposals from the
British Rail subsidiary in charge of the project which are strongly opposed
by the British Rail board.
If adopted, the option would mean abandoning plans for a new terminal at
London King's Cross and would seal the fate of the Pounds 3.4bn King's Cross
redevelopment project - the biggest inner city regeneration scheme in
Europe.
It would also mean bringing the trains into London along the surface-level
North London line which cuts a swathe through the residential areas of
Hackney, Dalston, Canonbury and Islington.
Transport ministers have been considering the latest options for building
the 68-mile railway line between London and the Channel tunnel since they
were submitted by BR early last month.
BR is believed to have brought the cost of the scheme down from the expected
Pounds 4.5bn to Pounds 2.5bn-Pounds 3bn by designing a route that goes up
and down the hills between London and the Channel tunnel instead of through
them. This will require more powerful trains to cope with the steeper
gradients.
Still to be decided, however, is the controversial issue of how trains will
pass through the suburbs of London from Stratford in the east to the
proposed King's Cross international terminal.
BR favours a tunnel leading into an underground terminal at King's Cross.
This would form part of its ambitious plans for a Pounds 1.4bn upgrade of
the InterCity and suburban railway interchanges at King's Cross and St
Pancras stations.
Its public position, however, masks deep divisions. Union Railways, the BR
subsidiary in charge of the rail link project, wants to pare up to Pounds
1bn more off the cost by using a surface level approach provided by the
North London line between Stratford and Islington.
International trains would veer off the North London line east of Caledonian
Road &amp; Barnsbury station and run either into the existing St Pancras station
or into a new station built at surface level on vacant railway land.
BR's board strongly opposes this plan because such a drastic change in
approach would wreck its plans for the Pounds 1.4bn King's Cross
interchange. That, in turn, would undermine wider plans for a Pounds 2bn
commercial development of the King's Cross railway lands, of which the
station redevelopment forms an integral part.
An approach by the North London line would prove unpopular with local
residents because of fears that widespread demolition would be necessary and
that remaining homes would suffer from noise.
Details are expected to be published towards the end of next month, followed
by public consultation. If legislation is introduced this autumn, the line
could open in 2000.

<TEXT>
Property shares have had a good run in response to lower interest rates. The
underlying market has been slower to respond. Perhaps equity investors sense
a recovery in capital values down the road as well as enhanced yield
attraction. That represents a maverick view in the direct market, where
buyers still need nerves of steel.
The fear is that property's plight is as much structural as cyclical. The
balance of leasehold power appears to be swinging from landlord to tenant,
threatening security of income. There is poor liquidity within the sector as
banks are loath to lend to would-be buyers. Commercial rents and asset
values continue to spiral downwards. Property's traditional appeal as a
hedge against inflation looks less relevant given deflationary pressures in
the global economy.
By most historical measures, property is cheap. Yields - now in excess of 10
per cent - have climbed above those on long-dated gilts for the first time
in decades. This reflects the risk of capital erosion. But it also points to
the possibility of attractive returns. Investors able to pick and choose can
find good value, as some German funds have found in central London. Some
custom-built properties for blue-chip tenants also hold out promising
prospects. Optimists suggest such investments imitate convertible bonds,
combining security of income with the capital appreciation of an equity
investment. Though this is true for selective sectors, capital appreciation
will not be a general market feature in the foreseeable future. More than
ever, investment skill will be at a premium.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese government's tactic of pouring public pension and postal funds
into an overvalued stock market may not be great value for the ultimate
beneficiaries, but then the authorities have more immediate concerns. Most
attention has focused on the risk that commercial banks may be unable to
meet their BIS capital adequacy ratios if the stock market falls much
further. Yet while the banks' capital is hardly generous and their bad debt
problems are large, fears of a severe credit crunch look overdone. With
companies cutting stocks and reducing capital investment, loan demand is
falling. Large banks which wish to top up their tier 2 capital can do so
through subordinated debt issues.
The government is probably more worried about trust banks and second-tier
life assurance companies. Some of these have virtually no unrealised capital
gains left on their equity portfolios. A further drop in equities could
leave them short of reserves. As returns on cash and bonds fall, they will
struggle to maintain bonuses. Cuts in bonus rates would, however, see
further cash outflows to more attractive savings products. The strains are
already showing. Last week the life companies announced a cut in the
discount rate they use to calculate long-term returns. Premiums will rise as
a result. Daido Mutual Life Insurance is reducing its head office staff by
10 per cent. The Ministry of Finance may relax rules requiring life
companies to write off foreign exchange losses on overseas bond holdings.
With the rivets creaking, some smaller life companies really need that share
support operation.

FT  08 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: US bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Treasury has given a hint of things to come in setting the amounts
for auction in this week's quarterly funding. By cutting the amount of 30-
and 10-year bonds on offer, it appears to be signalling a preference for
funding at the short end of the yield curve where rates are cheaper. It may
be several months before this is confirmed as official policy. But a move
which might hold down long yields must seem doubly tempting in that it could
reduce the residential mortgage rate and lift consumer confidence.
The trouble is that nothing comes without a price. If lower supply pushes
long-term rates down, extra supply will quickly push short-term rates up by
a similar amount. That will penalise companies which borrow in the
commercial paper market as well as homeowners who have borrowed at variable
rates. As the yield curve flattens, commercial banks would lose the windfall
gained from using cut-price deposits to buy Treasury bonds.
Still bigger risks are that the Clinton administration will fail to curb the
budget deficit and that recovery will eventually rekindle inflation. Then
refinancing a swollen pile of short-term debt would prove expensive. The
Treasury could rue the day it looked askance at 30-year money costing little
more than 7 per cent. The size of any fiscal stimulus and any subsequent
deficit reduction will have a larger impact on where yields finally settle
than shifting borrowing down the yield curve.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK fund managers have shown little enthusiasm for switching from equities
into gilts at current yields. But one might reasonably wonder how much
longer they will retain a free hand. Actuaries are asking mature pension
funds to favour the more certain investment income from bonds. Having paid
out too much in bonuses over the last three years, life assurance companies
are equally under regulatory pressure to increase weightings in
fixed-interest. Legal &amp; General has argued this may already be changing the
valuation relationship between bonds and equities.
Gilts might normally be expected to yield 2.3 times more than equities at
this stage in the cycle. Without any change in long gilt yields of 8.5 per
cent, the prospective yield on equities would have to fall below 4 per cent
before institutions were tempted into bonds. That implies sharply higher
share prices. But a yield ratio closer to 2 times - reflecting a greater
institutional preference for bonds - would enable long gilt yields to settle
at around 8.5 per cent this year, while allowing for a modest rally in
equities.
That may sound wishful thinking for a government worried about its funding
problem, not least because the maturing of pension fund liabilities is a
slow, incremental process. Life companies are equally under less pressure to
change investment strategy while equities are rising. Even so, the pension
law review committee is expected to recommend a minimum solvency standard
for pension funds this year. Actuaries may have little choice but to
recommend a higher weighting in bonds.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Dutch courage
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of Daf has brought the UK's political left and industrial right
into a not unfamiliar alliance. The Dutch and Flemish authorities, it is
said, have been prompt in offering Daf financial and moral support. The UK
has done nothing. As a result, Daf UK may go under while the rest is saved.
This typifies the dogmatic incompetence of a government which says it wants
a new approach to industrial policy but is impotent when the chips are down.
While this is understandable enough in emotional terms, it leaves a number
of awkward questions unaddressed: in particular, whether Daf is worth saving
in its present form. The answer seems sadly obvious. As Europe's sixth
biggest truck maker, Daf aimed to match its rivals' product range on a much
smaller sales base. It was also unduly dependent on the UK market. In 1991
Daf's manufacturing business made a loss equal to some 40 per cent of its
shareholders' funds. In 1992 it seems to have lost the remainder.
In book-keeping terms, the company is thus virtually worthless. Meanwhile,
the UK market is barely recovering and the rest of Europe is still in
decline. It is a truism to say that if enough money were pumped in, Daf
could keep going. Whether that would be a sensible deployment of scarce
economic resources is quite another matter.
Nor is it clear that the UK government was incompetent, as opposed to
obdurate, in its handling of the situation. The Department of Trade and
Industry was scarcely unaware of what was happening; indeed, it turned down
an appeal from Daf for Pounds 450m of state aid less than a year ago.
The question of whether the UK should have a more interventionist industrial
policy is a legitimate topic for debate. Commercial lost causes like Daf,
though, do little to further it; particularly when - as in the case of
Leyland Daf - they have already consumed some Pounds 600m of taxpayers'
money during 12 years of public ownership. That the Dutch authorities should
view things differently is scarcely a matter for surprise. Any government
which chooses to support commercial misjudgments on the scale of those at
Phillips, for example, plainly takes a broad view of economic utility.
But all this leaves out of account the question of what will happen to the
assets themselves. There is supposedly a plan afoot to separate out the
Dutch and Belgian parts of Daf, leaving the UK business to its own devices.
Some parts at least of the UK operation would doubtless then have to close;
but that might have happened anyway. There will presumably be competition to
buy at least the Leyland truck plant, which has a not insignificant total of
2,200 employees. If it is bought by a large and commercially viable
competitor, those 2,200 will in all probability be better off in the long
run than their publicly supported Dutch and Belgian colleagues.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Leading Article: US and Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHIN THE next few days the Clinton administration has to take its first
big foreign policy decision: how to respond to the Vance-Owen peace plan for
Bosnia-Hercegovina, which has the support of the EC and, not
insignificantly, of Russia. The plan has had a bad press in the US, not
helped by the arrogant and abrasive manner in which its British co-author,
Lord Owen, has been presenting it. There are in fact good reasons for
objecting to it, both of principle and of pragmatism.
The principled objection is that the plan partially ratifies the territorial
gains which the Serbs have achieved by 'ethnic cleansing', and virtually
dismantles a state and government which the international community has
recognised as legally sovereign. The pragmatic one is that the plan will be
diabolically difficult to implement. On past form the Serbs will not
willingly relinquish either territory or weapons, whatever pieces of paper
they sign; and the Bosnian army will be equally reluctant to give up
territory it holds in north-eastern Bosnia.
Thus it is clear that even if the plan is formally accepted by all three
parties, significant external forces will be needed on the ground to
implement it; and this could not be a pure peacekeeping force in the classic
UN tradition, authorised to fire only in self-defence. It would need a
mandate to use force to reimpose the ceasefire, in cases where one or more
of the parties on the ground was failing to abide by its terms.
European leaders believe that such a force would be credible only if the US
took part in it. This fact has been used by those arguing against the plan
in the US. Few American politicians, and even fewer military leaders, like
the idea of exposing GIs to such risks.
Yet it is a disingenuous argument when used by people who claim to espouse
the Bosnian cause. If the US rejects the plan, or sticks to its initial
position of being prepared to support the plan only if it is accepted by all
three parties, the Moslems will take that as a promise of US support for
them, and hold out for better terms. The question is, what form would that
support take?
A popular answer in some circles in Washington is that the arms embargo
should be lifted so that the Bosnians can fight their own battles. That
sounds good as a rhetorical position, but would be a very poor way to help
the Moslems if in fact the Serbs and Croats once again got the lion's share
of the weapons.
Some would go further and use US air power to compensate for Serb
superiority in heavy weapons. Such a policy would certainly not be
sanctioned by the Security Council, given the Russian veto.
The US's desire to avoid risks to its own troops is understandable, as is
its reluctance to endorse the Vance-Owen plan. Yet the only alternatives are
riskier, both for the Bosnians whom the US wishes to help and for the wider
peace of Europe.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Mr Smith's task
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER AN inexplicable period of delay, and following much throat-clearing
and shuffling of the feet, Mr John Smith has at last begun to lead the
Labour party. His speech to Labour's local government conference in
Bournemouth yesterday places him in the camp of the 'modernisers', those who
believe that the party must find a fresh set of policies if it is to stand a
chance of avoiding a fifth election defeat in 1996 or 1997.
The 'traditionalists', have been given short shrift. Mr Smith has clearly
learned the lesson of two national case-histories: in Britain Labour has
lost four times in a row because it did not keep in tune with the
aspirations of ordinary people; in the US the Democrats won last November
because President Bill Clinton understood what those aspirations were, and
shaped his campaign accordingly. It is plain that Mr Smith has drawn the
correct conclusion. Parties that look as if they represent the old left do
not stand a chance in either country; parties that restructure themselves
and adapt their programmes to changing circumstances can still realistically
hope to succeed.
It is perhaps for this reason that Mr Smith used the words 'new' and
'renewal' no less than 25 times in his 37-minute speech. He signalled the
abandonment of Labour's plans to renationalise some of the utilities. The
party's acceptance of the mixed economy was given a new twist, with a call
for partnership between 'dynamic markets and active government'. The needs
of the individual were stressed; the powers of cabinets - the 'elective
dictatorship' - were to be circumscribed by a series of reforms. 'Labour's
goal,' said Mr Smith, 'must be about the advancement of individual people,
about their ability to participate and their ability to prosper, which we
believe can only be achieved in the context of a strong and supportive
society.'
One speech does not make a political resurgence. Mr Smith's Bournemouth
address will fade from memory unless it is followed by radical deeds.
Modernisation must begin with a restructuring of the party itself, to
provide for one-member one-vote in all its counsels. Formal links with the
trade unions must be severed. If nationalisation is to be abandoned, the
relevant clause in the party constitution must be repealed. If a form of
full employment is to be espoused even as a distant ambition, the 'new
economics' of which Mr Smith spoke must be shown to be practical when Mr
Gordon Brown spells out the details. To be convincing, a programme of
constitutional change must include electoral reform. Mr Smith's new
Commission for Social Justice must not be allowed to ponder for too long.
The Conservatives have not lost their own capacity for radical change, as
the government's long-term study of public spending shows. If Mr Smith is
truly bold, a scheme to roll back the frontiers of the welfare state will
emerge as a 'new Labour' initiative. The idea worked well enough for Mr
Clinton's 'new Democrats'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard to remember the last time a politician resigned for falling off his
collapsible bike. However, the bizarre case of Leo McLeay, Australia's
parliamentary speaker, is one of those unforeseen incidents which just could
tip Australia's forthcoming general election.
It was not the over-weight McLeay's fault that he fell off his
Government-owned bike after he hit a pothole and broke his arm. But what has
upset Australians is the size of the ADollars 65,000 damages he won, and the
speed with which they were paid out, especially since he controls the
official department which he sued. No one suggests that McLeay has been
dishonest. But it took a long time before the compensation payment was
revealed and it has incensed Australians who feel they've been less well
treated in accidents.
McLeay is a close ally of Prime Minister Paul Keating and his embarrassing
resignation will only fuel complaints that after a decade in power the
government has lost touch with ordinary Australians. Norman Lamont should
take note.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Observer: Butler Cox II?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Can George Cox, the former chairman of the Management Consultancies
Association, recreate the same sort of magic at slumbering P-E International
as he did at his old firm of Butler Cox, one Britain's leading information
technology consultancies?
When an established firm of management know-alls, like P-E, has to go
outside for a new boss, it is a sign that all is not well. Having gone
public in 1986, P-E prospered in the boom, but has been unable to find the
right formula for bucking the recession. The dividend has had to be cut and
heads have rolled.
Enter George Cox, P-E's chairman since last May. He made a fortune selling
his old company at a sky-high multiple to the Americans two years ago. Now
he is trying to repair P-E. Having rejigged his board and put another new
arrival, Peter Smith, in charge of P-E's management consultancy side, he is
addressing the company's big weakness - its lack of a predictable and secure
source of income.
Cox's latest wheeze, the P-E Centre for Management Research, sounds
remarkably like one of his earlier bright ideas, the enormously successful
Butler Cox Foundation, a self-help subscription club for large companies.
Membership will cost Pounds 20,000 annually, discounted to Pounds 15,000 for
the first year, and medium-sized companies are being offered a cheaper rate.
The best ideas are usually the old ones, even in management consulting it
seems.

The Beeb is advertising for: a chief adviser, commercial and business

Why should one of the world's canniest fund managers seek advice on property
investment from the central figure in the world's most spectacular property
empire collapse?
Well, George Soros replied, he was excited that his new Quantum Realty
property fund is to be advised by Paul Reichmann, whose abilities as a
'developer and creator of values' are outstanding even though his
Canadian-based Olympia &amp; York business has been under bankruptcy court
protection for the past nine months.
Take for example Reichmann's three real estate 'grand slams' - the
development of downtown Toronto in the early 1970s; taking a big stake in
Manhattan property in 1977 at the bottom of the market; and the successful
development of the World Financial Center in New York in the 1980s.
True, Soros conceded, there was also Canary Wharf in London's docklands,
which helped to precipitate O&amp;Y's collapse. But that 'taught investors
important lessons, which we intend to apply in the management of Quantum
Realty'. In particular: 'If you pyramid your leverage (build up layer on
layer of debt) eventually you are going to come a cropper.'
While the new fund will buy mainly in North America, he added, it might also
invest in Latin American markets and Europe, including London.
So might the line stretch to Canary Wharf, now in the hands of
administrators? That, said Soros, was 'rather a distant possibility,' since
the fund would not have sufficient money at its disposal.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Letter: A wartime lesson for funding large PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof BRIAN TEW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The last time the UK had the problem of funding a very large public
sector borrowing requirement was during the second world war. A crude
adaptation of war-time funding techniques to the circumstances of today
would be as follows:
1) Keep open a gilt-edged tap with yields that the government would pledge
not to increase, so that investors would have no incentive to delay
purchases in the hope of a better yield later on. (In the war the gilts tap
yield was set at 3 per cent: obviously it would now have to be set more or
less in line with present market rates).
2) Keep base rates and money market rates on average well below the yields
on tap gilts, so as to make gilts an attractive investment.
3) To deter the banks from unduly monetising the national debt (which would
be a profitable operation with long rates higher than short rates and no
likelihood of them increasing) subject each bank to a call of special
deposits equal to, say, half its net investment in gilts. (In this way
special deposits would play much the same role as war-time Treasury Deposit
Receipts.)
An obvious disadvantage is that the authorities' control over the broad
money stock would probably be even more precarious than hitherto. Its
obvious advantage is that it's one way of selling a lot of gilts.

FT  08 FEB 93 / An alternative to the 'Group of Seven'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Too many hopes have been invested in the 'Group of Seven' - that is, the UK
forecasters who are to meet regularly to provide the Treasury with
alternative views of the economic prospects.
It is better than nothing and will be helpful for those of us who use rather
than create economic numbers. Nevertheless the concentration of the
so-called 'new Treasury openness' on this group is a symptom of the
prevalence of old-type thinking. As excessive reliance on forecasts (not
just Treasury ones) is in part responsible for present predicaments, it is
unlikely that more of the same will provide a cure. Moreover, the attention
paid to the group encourages the delusion - prevalent among businessmen as
well as policymakers - that economics is all about forecasting. In fact,
many Nobel prize-winners in the subject have never made a short-term
forecast.
There is an innate human desire for crystal-gazers. Yet the real art of
policy-making is to be able to respond to events. The role of research is to
help devise institutions which will promote good performance and provide a
degree of automatic stabilisation.
An alternative path for opening up policy-making has been provided by the
Swedish prime minister, Carl Bildt. He has appointed the distinguished
economist, Professor Assar Lindbeck, to head a small commission to report in
a very few months on new directions for Swedish policy. Whether or not the
commission's report contains medium-term projections, the emphasis will be
on analysis and measures.
There are some striking similarities between Sweden and the UK. Sweden too
has been without a policy anchor since it stopped shadowing the European
Currency Unit, after a much more impressive defence than any put up for the
exchange rate mechanism in Britain. Sweden too has, under its minority
right-wing government, tried to break with its Social Democratic past by
putting more emphasis on competition and the private sector.
But Sweden has had a much more severe recession than Britain. It also
resembles the UK in adopting an inflation target to replace the ERM anchor.
The strong contrast is that the Riksbank has full authority to get on with
the job.
The purpose of appointing the Lindbeck commission is to give advice which is
clearly independent of both the official and the party machines. It was
decided after discussions between Mr Bildt and his finance minister, Mrs
Anne Wibble, without consulting the Finance Ministry at all.
One difficulty of following this route in the UK is that there is no
outstanding economist, combining theoretical and practical flair, who would
be respected by, say, 80 per cent of economic opinion for such a task. Mr
Bildt hopes that proposals from the Lindbeck committee will command greater
assent than any from the government alone, but he is not committed in
advance.
The Swedish government deserves attention for much wider reasons. The most
forthright experiments in market economics are now taking place in two
rather unlikely places - Sweden and the Czech Republic. The Czech prime
minister, Mr Vaclav Klaus, has said that the supposed 'third way' between
capitalism and socialism is the quickest route to the third world. Mr Bildt
says the same in different words.
The Swedish third way collapsed partly because of the weight of taxation
required to pay for its welfare state. It also suffered from the attempt to
run too tight a labour market and maintain competitiveness by a series of
devaluations.
When the Swedish prime minister says that 'growth will only come about as a
result of policies of deregulation, privatisation, increased competition and
lower taxes', he sounds like the British government of the 1980s. But there
are notable differences as well. Unlike Lady Thatcher, Mr Bildt does not
regard consensus as a dirty word; he managed to secure from the opposition
Social Democrats, unions and employers support for the earlier measures to
defend the krona.
The consensus was shattered when the new budget made inroads into the
welfare state, including some trimming of unemployment benefit and the age
at which pensions could be paid. The size of the Swedish budget deficit - at
nearly 14 per cent of GNP, higher than Italy's and Greece's - made action
imperative. Unlike even the Thatcherite Tories, the Swedish government is
determined that the budget deficit should be cut entirely by expenditure
curbs and not by tax increases.
This determination can hardly be regarded as extreme when taxes account for
some 57 per cent of GDP, among the highest in the western world. Indeed,
Moody's Investor Services has just made a slight cut in the country's debt
rating, which has made the government all the more concerned to persevere
with its strategy.

Sir, Mr Dantzic (Letters, February 2) and the manufacturing sector may be

We are the UK arm of a German furniture company. Since September 16 1992 we
have been approaching British companies in order to sub-contract the
manufacture of certain steel and aluminium products.
We are stupefied. Despite the fact that all of the companies approached are
still in business, we have not received a response to 30 per cent of our
letters. A further 20 per cent had to be sent a second letter before a
response was received. One respondent stated: 'We won't make you a sample in
case you take the business elsewhere.' Prices have occasionally been
preposterous, and the quality of samples - where available - is normally
poor. Our products are simple and do not require high technology machinery
for their manufacture. We agree that there is a surfeit of importers.
Is the sector really devoid both of adept finance directors and willing
production directors?

FT  08 FEB 93 / Letter: No case for central bank freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir BRYAN HOPKIN and Sir DOUGLAS WASS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Apart from the personal criticisms directed at ourselves, the three
letters which our arguments (Personal View, January 22) provoked make only
two counter-arguments.
First, a non-political monetary authority would constrain the government in
the field of taxation and expenditure (P W Bloomer, January 25); second, it
would convince the markets that price stability would be maintained (Alan
Beith, January 26).
The first point has been demonstrated to be patently untrue in the case of
the US, where fiscal deficits have run unchecked for a decade despite an
independent Federal Reserve. But if the proposition were true, it implies
that your correspondent thinks that it would be a good thing if the Bank of
England indirectly controlled fiscal policy. This is an idea we have not
previously encountered.
The second point is equally unsupported by the evidence. It resembles the
now-discredited argument that Britain's joining the EMS would convince the
markets that price stability would be secured.
Markets are impressed by experience rather than by the mere fact of
institutional change. If we had a government whose policies revealed a lack
of commitment to opposing inflation, the markets would not be comforted by
an independent central bank, and if conflict ensued that would itself be bad
for confidence and economic stability.
Mr Beith also clearly believes that it is possible to defeat inflation
without generating unemployment. This too flies in the face of recent
experience. It may be that in the long run we shall be able to establish an
environment of wage and price restraint in conditions of high employment,
but that happy conjuncture does not obtain now, and it is difficult to see
how the establishment of an independent central bank would bring it about.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Letter: Contracting out - the legal cases favouring
employers, and an alternative solution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SHELDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report of government advice on contracting out of public services
('Caution on 'grey area' in tendering', February 4) illustrates that
ministers have finally been forced to accept that the Transfer of
Undertakings Regulations (Tupe) and the EC Acquired Rights Directive do
apply to the market testing and compulsory competitive tendering programmes.
After months of public service minister William Waldegrave and employment
minister Michael Forsyth frantically denying any such thing (a 'red herring'
was how they described Tupe), we now have the ridiculous spectacle of the
government advising departments to seek legal advice on every market test.
With hundreds of market tests, just how much is this likely to cost the
taxpayer? Desperate to find some face-saving formula for the legal ostriches
of the department of environment's compulsory competitive tendering team,
all ministers can manage is an enormous job creation scheme for lawyers.
There is a straightforward solution to the government's problem: cancel the
market testing programme or, failing that, issue instructions to departments
that all invitations to tender should specify that Tupe applies.

   From Mr MICHAEL IVENS

<TEXT>
Sir, John Willman and David Goodhart state in 'Contracting out policies face
further trouble' (February 3): 'The leading employment QC, Mr Patrick Elias,
has advised the local authorities' association that the EC directive is
likely to apply in most cases where a service is contracted out'. They then
say that an amendment to the regulations now passing through parliament will
make this absolutely clear.
It would be vulgar to play the game of 'our QC is more leading that yours',
but certainly a very leading QC has advised the contract cleaning industry
quite differently - resulting in something like 40 legal cases brought by
the trade unions arguing for the interpretation of 'Transfer of
Undertakings' having been defeated in favour of the employers. And the
address of the attorney general to the parliamentary committee made it clear
that contracting out services will be legally taken on their merits.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Surgery plans lead to complications: The government faces a
tough decision, even if it does not close London hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, UK health secretary, has vowed that the government
will not shirk tough decisions when it responds this month to
recommendations for widespread hospital closures in London.
She is right that it will have tough decisions to make, but they may not be
the ones she originally intended.
As a cabinet committee prepares to finalise its position this week, some
ministers are fearful of provoking a repetition of the public uproar that
followed the announcement of the pit closures. They are therefore shying
away from shutting world-famous hospitals - as recommended by Sir Bernard
Tomlinson in his report on the future of London healthcare, published last
October. A rejection of his plan to eliminate 2,500 hospital beds in the
capital would, however, simply be exchanging one set of tough decisions for
another.
The internal market set up by the 1991 health reforms has led to a loss of
patients from inner London's teaching hospitals to local ones in outer
London and the home counties. If ministers abandoned Tomlinson, they would
have to decide how to handle a financial crisis in the capital's hospitals,
and face serious questions about their commitment to a market-based health
service.
The government's attack of doubt reflects concern raised by a series of
public campaigns to save individual hospitals.
All have been overshadowed by the fight to save St Bartholomew's hospital in
the City, the most ancient institution on the closure list. In campaigning
terms, it has been a brilliant, sustained exercise, even though staff at
other hospitals regard the Bart's campaign as elitist and emotional.
'It has lacked nothing except artificial snow and a violin,' commented one
senior manager at another hospital. It needed neither. Instead, the Lord
Mayor of London visited Mrs Bottomley to plead for Bart's; the Duke of
Gloucester made a rare intervention in the House of Lords on its behalf;
there were services in St Paul's Cathedral; and an international brigade of
alumni has written to the rescue.
But the power of the Bart's campaign presents the government with a dilemma.
The health reforms introduced in 1991 were intended to produce a more
rational decision-making structure to the National Health Service, based on
market principles rather than short-term political priorities. A decision to
reprieve Bart's would look like capitulation to the campaign with the most
political and media clout, rather than, for example, to those run by Charing
Cross or St Thomas' hospitals. The message to the rest of the reformed NHS
would be that political anxieties and vested interests can still beat the
market.
Another worry for ministers concerns the as-yet unquantified capital cost of
a huge reorganisation - Sir Bernard was not asked to produce a detailed
financial analysis of his proposals. In the 1980s, the sale of prime central
London hospital sites like the Middlesex and St Bartholomew's would have
funded new primary and community health centres, as well as redundancy
payments; the current state of the property market means that this is
unlikely today.
Tomlinson's report was not the first to recommend change to London's
hospital structure. About 20 others have been published in the past 100
years but, in the face of hostile public and professional opinion, little
has happened.
The public does not like hospital closures. Arguments to justify them -
based on changes in patient flows, service provision, lengths of stay and
medical technology - are often dense. They cannot compete with the
instinctive, lay counter-argument that it must be wrong to close famous
institutions dedicated to the saving of life.
The latest restructuring attempt, however, began more promisingly for
proponents of strong action than many previous ones. The Tomlinson inquiry
was timed to report just after the general election, in the period of a
government's life when tough action stands most chance of being taken.
Its central recommendation is that resources be shifted from hospital beds
to the capital's relatively poor-quality family doctor and community
services. Critics worry whether, in the present state of public spending,
the government will invest enough in local services to make Tomlinson's
vision work. But the principle of shifting resources is widely endorsed.
Expensive beds in London teaching hospitals are regularly taken by elderly
patients: even when their medical treatment has been completed, they cannot
be discharged because of deficient community facilities. Nearly half the
capital's family doctors work from sub-standard premises.
In a political bonus for the government, the British Medical Association and
Royal College of Nursing endorsed the principle of hospital closures,
although many of their members' jobs would disappear.
If the government were now to back away from the large-scale closure
programme, it would still have to provide funds for London's teaching
hospitals. This financial year, they will receive a Pounds 50m subsidy.
Health authority members in areas of the country with growing populations -
and marginal Conservative constituencies - are complaining that their
districts are underfunded because of over-provision in London.
Mr Peter Fairey, chief executive of the Royal London hospital, was
administrator of North East Thames regional health authority in the early
1980s, and took part in an earlier examination of hospital provision in
inner London.
'We came to similar conclusions to Tomlinson,' he says. 'There had been
another exercise in the early 1970s and that came to similar conclusions as
well.
'The scale of the problem changes every time decisions are avoided, but
people who study the issue always conclude that London cannot justify or
sustain its present number of hospitals.'
Ms Virginia Beardshaw, director of the London initiative of the King's Fund
health policy unit - which also favours shifting resources from hospitals to
community services - says: 'The government is between the devil and the deep
blue sea. It faces political concerns about hospital closures on the one
hand, and the continuing financial problems of the hospitals on the other.'
Those ministers who fear that hospital closures threaten fresh political
turmoil will argue for the deep blue sea, where things at least have a
chance of drifting. Mrs Bottomley could make a statement of principle this
month, leaving firmer decisions until later in the year when reviews of the
allocation of specialist services in London have been completed. With a
little dust on its cover, the Tomlinson report could soon look
indistinguishable from its 20 unimplemented predecessors.
Many of the London teaching hospitals, however, are in an even weaker
financial position than their managers admit. Health authorities in outer
London and the home counties have made it clear that they prefer to treat
patients locally, and this trend is likely to increase as contracts for
treatment - based on established service patterns in the early years of the
NHS reforms - become more flexible.
Sir Bernard's report leaves no doubt about what he thinks would happen if
his recommendations were shelved. 'Change is inevitable, owing to the forces
of the internal market highlighting inequity and inefficiency in the present
distribution of hospital facilities. If this change is not managed firmly -
and in certain cases, ur-gently - the result will be a haphazard
deterioration in health services in London.' That deterioration would mean
bed closures and cancelled operations - and it would be exacerbated by the
current tight public spending pressures on the NHS.
The government may fear the political repercussions of announcing hospital
closures now. But if Mrs Bottomley's tough decisions are deferred, the
financial position of the London hospitals is likely to worsen every year,
and reach crisis point before the next general election - when the political
pressures would be even more acute.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (12): Prevailing winds set the pace -
Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICS in Iran these days is very little about the conflict between
government and opposition and almost everything to do with the tensions
within a regime which has largely consolidated its grip on power.
Opposition to the regime exists in a formal sense through such organisations
as the Mujahideen-e-Khalq, once allied with the clergy in toppling Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, but its visibility within Iran has, along with other
political factions, been relentlessly whittled down over the past 10 years.
In a less structured sense, popular discontent remains far more audible than
Iran's external image would suggest. Inflation, unemployment, lack of
housing, rigid dress codes and the absence of entertainment facilities
contribute to an absence of enthusiasm for a government which in a western
democratic system would spell probably disaster at the next election.
If ministers had failed to notice the extent of this dissaffection it was
brought sharply home to them when many thousands of people in Mashhad and
other cities rioted during the summer. The harshness of the government
response emphasised its determination to nip the protests in the bud, but
subsequent modification of policies has revealed how shaken part of the
regime was by the outburst of public hostility. Some senior clergy refuse to
acknowledge the idea of a Moslem people at odds with an Islamic government,
but this does not appear to include members of the Majlis (parliament) whose
attitudes during the second part of last year underwent a significant shift.
At the time of the parliamentary elections in April and May it was assumed,
with some justification, that President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani was
orchestrating a legislature more in tune with his own ideas, especially for
modernising the economy.
Certainly the president succeeded in removing some of his more vocal
critics. But the new Majlis has shown itself to be much more conservative
than expected and far from sympathetic to the more western-oriented
technocrats in the government who had been arguing for more emphatic action
on economic reforms, such as privatisation and the unification of the
exchange rate. On social issues, too, the past six months has been marked by
some reversal of the more relaxed attitudes which had been gaining ground.
Women's dress code has been more rigorously enforced, there have been a
flurry of attacks on publications which deviated from the official line, and
at night in the main cities there has been a significant increase in the
number of roadblocks manned by the baseej, the militia force which is
charged with the defence of the revolution. This could be interpreted as a
setback for President Rafsanjani and his attempt to make the Islamic
revolution more palatable to western nations. But with the president facing
re-election in June it would anyway be prudent for him to bend with the
prevailing wind.
The main concern for the president is said to be preventing any form of link
developing between the men he ejected from parliament last summer and the
popular discontent evident in Mashhad. Accordingly, it would be politically
hazardous to adopt policies in the short term which could have an effect on
the living standards of the poorest or, at the other end of the income
scale, threaten the capacity of bazaar merchants to generate profits. No-one
in Tehran doubts that Mr Rafsanjani will be re-elected by a substantial
majority, but the regime can be less confident that it was of the public
mood. Part of the reason for that stems from the unique role played by
Ayatollah Khomeini in the overthrow of the previous regime and in the
establishment of an Islamic republic. No successor could inherit that
combination of political legitimacy and spiritual authority.
Ayatollah Sayed Ali Khamenei has the authority of being the country's
spiritual leader, but other ayatollahs rank above him as Islamic jurists. To
that extent, spiritual leader and president need each other, and can be
viewed as different sides of the same coin.
They are also individually incapable of exerting decisive influence over the
entire regime and government machinery. There is no concept of cabinet
responsibility, such as practised in Britain. Ministers do not meet as a
single, political entity. Rather there are committees, grouping several
ministries, at which most decisions are taken. Mr Rafsanjani may not have
initiated those decisions, but Iranians close to the process say it operates
on an assumption of presidential approval unless clear opposition has been
voiced.
Then there are areas of economic and political activity which are more
loosely part of the regime but largely unaccountable to anyone. The most
obvious examples are the bonyads, or religious foundations, the largest and
most powerful of which is the Bonyad Mostazafin headed by Mr Mohsen
Rafiqdoost.
It produces no accounts, has an annual income thought to run into hundreds
of millions of dollars, is becoming involved in aviation, would like to get
into the oil industry and is sometimes suspected of funding political
activities overseas.
More shadowy still, but very much part of the political scene, are the
organisations within organisations. In several key government ministries,
Iranians say that there is a clearly detectable alternative grouping, owing
an allegiance beyond the immediate obvious authority.
So although President Rafsanjani enjoys considerable authority, it is
clearly limited and does not extend equally throughout the full range of the
regime's activities. He can be rebuffed, needs to cajole the Majlis, and can
be badly wrong-footed by a decision taken elsewhere in the administration
which is subsequently difficult to reverse.
It appears that Mr Rafsanjani knows broadly the direction in which he wishes
to lead the country and appreciates that the population needs more than
Islamic fervour to remain supportive of the revolution. However, he is quite
prepared to take at least half a step back for every one that he takes
forward. The evolution of Iran under the clergy is likely to move more at
the pace of the tortoise than that of the hare.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (13): Understanding the problem - Salman
Rushdie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON February 14, 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a 'fatwa', or religious
decree, that the author of the book Satanic Verses, Mr Salman Rushdie, had
been sentenced to death. The announcement caused a storm of international
protest and continues to bedevil Iran's relations with other countries,
particularly Britain. Mr Javad Larijani, special adviser on foreign affairs
to President Rafsanjani, explained the Iran's attitude to the issue:
'In order to solve this problem you first must really understand it. That is
the key. The Rushdie case has parallels with all the religions in the world.
It is an issue of blasphemy of the prophets.
'In Judaism and Christianity the verdict is much harsher than in Islam. What
Imam Khomeini conveyed is simply what Islam thinks about a man who is guilty
of blasphemy. So why blame Iran when that is how Islam thinks about a
particular case? It is like blaming Jesus Christ for the way in which
Christianity deals with blasphemy. In the 19th century there were cases in
Rome and other places when they burned the man who had blasphemed the
prophet.
'If we understand the heart of this matter, then no politician in London
would ask an Iranian politician to disown the fatwa because it would be like
disowning Islam and the Koran. This is not the sort of condition which
British politicians should put on relations with Iran. It is quite
unreasonable. The only condition put on relations between two countries
should be mutual interest and respect.
'I think in this case perhaps the government in London is being manipulated.
British politicians are wise enough to know all the tricks of politics. I do
not find it easy to see what benefit there is for London by getting into
such a game with Iran. I think they still do not fully understand in the
west what the meaning of a fatwa is.
'Politicians in London should not teach us how to understand Islam, in the
same way as we should not teach them how to understand the Leviathan of
Hobbes. Instead we should get down to business, into those areas of mutual
and converging interests in the economic and political spheres that do exist
between us. Let us capitalise on the areas where we converge, rather than
where we diverge.
'The issue of Salman Rushie is sometimes inflated by circles connected to
Israel. They are very unhappy with relations between the west and Iran. I do
not believe in conspiracy theories, but I cannot ignore that Israel does
have a good apparatus for making some issues known to public opinion. They
are strong at that.
'But, anyhow, it is the perceptions which are so different. The west
considers the case like this: the head of a government is pointing his
finger at a man in a foreign country and saying that this man should be
executed because he wrote a book. If this is the type of picture being
presented then it will be not very tolerable for the west.
'From our side the picture is quite different. We consider him (Rushdie) as
a man who tried to betray Islam, to downgrade Islam and to downgrade the
sentiments of more than a billion Moslems. So we said only what Islam
expects for that man: that he does not deserve to exist. It's like, for
example, you pointing your finger at Hitler when he was alive and saying
that this man should be tried and executed a hundred times. This does not
mean that you are sending paratroops to execute him.
'The main barrier, if we are to have an honest debate of this issue, is
cultural, and the very deep emotion which blocks real understanding. The key
is to understand the case objectively. Perhaps some debates between
intellectuals, writers and thinkers could be very helpful. But this does not
rest only on our shoulders. This should be done from both sides. It is not
right for Britain to put all the blame on Iran.'

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (11): Crisis looms - Population Growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PARICHEHRE MOSTESHAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTEEN years ago, under the rule of the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi,
Iran was hard put to meet the needs of its 29m population. Now, after
revolution, eight years of destructive war, a fall in the oil price and an
explosion in the birth rate, it faces a far worse population crisis.
Even before the revolution, many Iranians saw having many children as a sign
of God's blessing. With the accession to power of Ayatollah Khomeini,
producing more Moslems became a political as well as religious duty. Every
Iranian born was an arrow through the heart of the Great Satan (the US), he
told his flock. The nation took up his call with an enthusiasm that resulted
in today's population of 60m.
The war with Iraq, with its human-wave tactics and devastating casualties,
added extra impetus to the task of giving birth to more Moslems.
Fifteen years later, the Health Ministry admits that some 37 per cent of
Iranian children under seven are malnourished. Homelessness, unemployment,
illiteracy and poverty have increased.
Mr Mohammed Hashemi, head of the Iranian Broadcasting Service, is often
taken to task for not doing enough to spread the family planning message. He
says: 'You say put on programmes about birth control, but when I do our
phone lines are jammed with fathers saying 'My 14 year-old daughter is
listening, take this programme off.''
According to Mr Mohammed Reza Malakzadeh, health minister, the birth rate
now stands at 33 per thousand of population with 45.5 per cent of Iranians
aged under 14. 'The proportion of employed to unemployed people is 1:1 in
Iran, compared with 2:32 in Japan,' Mr Malekzadeh says.
'In the last ten years the gulf between the resources the country needs and
what is available has grown alarmingly. We have not had time to catch up
with the hospitals and beds needed, because of the growth of the
population,' he explained. To cope with the present population, Iran needed
40,000 new classrooms, 500,000 residential units, 600,000 new jobs and
Dollars 5bn invested in the agricultural sector.
Mr Mohammad Ali Najafi, education minister, faces similar problems.
'Uncontrolled student population growth is one of the dire consequences of
the rise in population. To keep up with the population growth we need 10,000
university-educated teachers each year. At present we can only answer 60 per
cent of educational needs,' he said.
For Mr Massoud Roghani-Zanjani, vice-president and head of the Plan and
Budget Organisation, the answer is to remove all the incentives previously
introduced to encourage reproduction. Two years ago, the government actively
encouraged large families, giving them extra ration coupons, help with
housing, and subsidies for childrens' clothing. Most incentives have now
gone, but Mr Roghani-Zanjani wants to see the last ones removed and
penalties imposed.
Although the population growth rate has eased slightly - 3.3 per cent in
1988-89 to 2.7 per cent this year - more women are now reaching reproductive
age and they are the ones the government is most anxious to reach with its
family planning message.
Mr Malekzaden says that population control is top of his agenda. Measures
introduced include free contraception and free sterilisation at 400
hospitals nationwide. His ministry claims that 200,000 people were
sterilised in 1991.
But at the end of the day, it was the policies of the clerics which
aggravated the problem and it is they who must solve it.
Foremost in the war on population growth is Ayatollah Makarem Shirazi, a
senior theologian at the Qom seminary. He admits that the Koran encourages
large families. But he argues that an important factor in Islam is the
instruction to 'take account of time and location'.
He argues that no religious 'law-maker' would argue that 'it is better to
have 100bn uneducated, poor and unhealthy people, than to have 60m living in
good conditions.'
Today's message, according to the Ayatollah, is that 'the man who stood
proud and said I have seven children must learn that he must apologise
instead.'

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (10): Objectives prove elusive - Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IRAN was self-sufficient in food in the 1950s but a number of factors,
including the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's land reform programme, meant
that by the time of the revolution in 1979, Iran was a net importer of food.
The Islamic government aimed to make Iran self-sufficient by 1992 and to
halt rural to urban migration but it has fallen far short of these
objectives.
There have been some successes but poor planning and changes of policy
towards ownership of land, have impeded the efficient use of available
resources. Only in the most recent (1989/90-1993/94) five-year plan has
agriculture been given priority over industry.
Iran's cultivated areas have expanded minimally since the revolution. In
1978, the area of land cultivation was 17.8m hectares and the figure only
increased fractionally to 18.5m ha in 1987.
An Agriculture Ministry official, while reporting that Kerman province
topped those producing non-oil exports with its exports of pistachios, dates
and citrus fruits last year, bemoaned the fact that 400,000 hectares of
fertile land had become desert and 55 per cent of the 120,000m cu m of water
reserves was wasted due to negligence.
Iran imports between 30 and 50 per cent of its food requirements. The
government expects food imports to double by the year 2006 if the birth rate
continues its present rate of growth. Food imports cost the country about
Dollars 3bn a year.
The government has not been able to stem the tide of migrants into the
cities. Out of a total population of 58m, 43 per cent live in the
countryside. Migration to the cities has accelerated consistently . Last
month, the government said that if the trend continued, the countryside
would lose its productive strength.
The number of people employed in agricultural activities gradually dropped
from 38 per cent to 29 per cent of the rural population in the 30 years to
1986, while rural unemployment continues to grow at a faster rate than in
the cities.
The Jihad-e-Sazandeghi (Construction Crusade), set up after the revolution
to send young men into the countryside to build roads and spread education,
said in its annual report published last year: 'The migration of villagers
to urban areas is to a large extent due to lack of even the basic essentials
necessary for their livelihood, such as educational, medical and
recreational facilities.'
Last year, Mr Issa Kalantari, agriculture minister, outlined some of the
challenges facing the agricultural sector. 'Lack of agricultural specialists
was one of the main problems as was a shortage of resources. As the national
five-year development plan was being compiled we did not think of the
bureaucracy of provisioning, that is, we did not meet its complexities,' he
said.
The plan called for farmlands to be consolidated at the rate of 150,000ha in
1989 and 1990, and 200,000ha in 1991. But because machinery was not
delivered, the consolidation in the first year was nil, in the second year
it was 79,000ha and in the third year 100,000 hectares, said Mr Kalantari.
He said that farmers had only been provided with 14,000 of the 105,000
tractors assumed in the plan while only 12,000 of the projected 61,000
tillers had been provided.
Shortfalls in funding have also been a problem.
The government has focused on the intensification of agriculture by trying
to improve yields. Some 60 per cent of the area under cultivation for
important farming crops is allocated to wheat. Farmers are encouraged by
government buying at fixed prices. In 1990, the government increased the
support price of wheat and provided agricultural equipment at the official
exchange rate of Dollars 1 to IR70 rather than the floating exchange rate of
about IR1,400. It also granted banking facilities at the preferential rate.
Other measures include a new law on direct taxation, brought in a year ago,
under which all revenues from agriculture were made exempt from tax for an
unspecified period.
Wheat production has risen substantially to 10.4m tonnes this year, up from
8.75m tonnes in 1990-91 and 5.8m tonnes in 1989. The government hopes to be
self-sufficient in wheat by March 1994.
However, lack of storage is a problem and projects are under way for the
construction of more silos.
In the year to March 1993, there were rises, too, in production of barley,
sugar-beet and pulses but declines in maize and cotton.
The guaranteed prices to farmers combined with food subsidies have proved an
expensive burden on the state's resources. Last year, President Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani said: 'We are paying a heavy price for subsidies. Our
people receive bread practically free of charge. We buy wheat at IR150 a
kilo, convert it into flour and pass it on to the people at IR10 a kilo.'
The other notable agricultural success has been the work of the Jihad,
particularly in the early years of the revolution, in taking electricity and
water to the villages and extending the road network throughout the
countryside.
In the 10 years to 1992, the Jihad built 46,000km of roads and 1,000m of
bridges. It expects 70 per cent of rural population to be linked by road by
the end of the five-year plan. The number of villages supplied with
electricity has fallen back since 1985. In its annual report for 1992, the
Jihad said: 'The declining curve from 1364 (1985) onwards has been caused by
the shortage in construction material resulting from foreign exchange
problems.'
The Jihad's frustration in dealing with the system are apparent in its
comments on shortcomings in the agricultural sector. In its report it said:
'Measures taken by the government have failed to meet the basic needs of the
rural population properly, for various reasons such as lack of clear
planning and strategy for development and concentration of all facilities in
urban areas (especially Tehran).'
Until Iran can deal with the bottlenecks in the agricultural sector, it is
unlikely that it can meet its objectives of food self-sufficiency and rural
growth in the foreseeable future.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (8): Competition encouraged - Banking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SINCE he became President, Mr Hashemi Rafsanjani's decision to promote a
more open economic system and to encourage greater private sector
participation in the economy has been extended to the banking system.
Iran's banks were nationalised after the 1979 revolution when restructuring
took place with a number of bank mergers. Bank Mellat (the Nation's Bank),
for example, was the result of a merger of 10 banks. However, it took many
years before a system of Islamic banking was implemented.
The 1983 Usury-Free Banking Act allowed for two types of deposit:
interest-free savings and current accounts and short- and long-term
investment accounts. It took another three years before the system was in
operation. The result, according to one Iranian banker is that Iran's
domestic banks have become 'glorified post offices.'
The aim of the legislation was for customers to use the banks to make
transactions rather than money. However, the Act also allowed banks to give
prizes and bonuses on the interest-free accounts and to pay profits on the
investment accounts. The banks pay interest out of their profits and charge
a fee for loans.
The rate paid is determined by the Supreme Council of Banks, a body whose
members include Mr Mohsen Nurbakhsh, the minister for economics and finance,
Mr Mohammad Adeli, the governor of the central bank, and managing directors
of the banks.
Iran's overseas banking operations have not been included in the Islamic
system and they have continued to operate interest-paying banking. The
banking system is dominated by the role of the Bank Markazi which allocates
foreign exchange to the domestic banks. The liberalisation measures involve
loosening Bank Markazi's control over the domestic banks and encouraging
competition between them. Before the reforms, Bank Markazi set annual limits
on lending based on the previous year's figure plus 10 per cent.
The domestic banks can now attract deposits and are obliged only to lodge a
proportion of these with Bank Markazi.
In order to attract more deposits, the rate offered on private sector
deposits was increased in 1990 for the first time since the 1983 Usury-Free
Act. The banks' fees on loans were also increased from a range of 4-12 per
cent to 6-19 per cent.
Last year the interest offered on deposits was again raised, this time by
one percentage point. The rates were set at 14 per cent interest on
five-year deposits in the year ended March 1992, 10 per cent on one-year
deposits and 6.5 per cent on three-month deposits.
Private deposits with the commercial and specialised banks rose from
IR8,080bn in 1986-87 to IR18,850bn in 1990-91, the first year of the
reforms.
Of this amount, term investment deposits increased their proportion slightly
from 60.8 per cent to 62.5 per cent.
The Supreme Council of Banks, which usually sets the same rate of return for
all banks, will now allow banks to set different rates in order to promote
competition. The banks face competition not only between themselves but also
with the bazaar where money-lenders charge interest at rates anywhere
between 30 and 50 per cent.
Bank Markazi has also called for the operation of private non-banking
financial institutions, which the domestic banks are keen to establish, in
order to take advantage of a relatively buoyant stock market. Banks,
including Bank Melli, Iran's largest domestic bank, have set up joint stock
investment companies to trade on the stock exchange. There is no suggestion
at this stage, however, that the banks taken under state control after the
revolution would be denationalised.
One reform has caused much controversy outside Iran. Bank Markazi's decision
in 1991 to draw back from providing guarantees for credits from abroad and
to hand over the job to the state commercial banks is thought to be the main
reason for the prolonged delay in Iran's ability to meet its payments for
maturing letters of credit.
Difficulties first arose last summer and despite expectations that this was
to be a short-lived development, delays continue.
According to one Iranian banker, the main reason for the delays is that
previously foreign exchange requirements for letters of credit were
allocated and cleared before the letter of credit was opened. This is no
longer the case.
The amount of foreign exchange income which the country would be earning was
also over-estimated, leading to a shortfall of resources.
However, Mr Adeli has been keen to stress that the delays are the result of
bad management due to lack of expertise on the part of the commercial banks
rather than a shortage of foreign exchange.
Estimates of the amount of Iran's outstanding debt vary widely. The
Basel-based Bank for International Settlements found that Iran's liabilities
to commercial banks abroad reached a record high of Dollars 8.3bn in the
second quarter of 1992 with assets dropping to Dollars 5.8bn.
BIS figures show that Iran increased its liabilities by Dollars 4bn from
September 1991 to June 1992 and the bank estimated total external
indebtedness at about Dollars 15.5bn in June 1992.
That figure is thought to have increased since then and current estimates
are in the order of at least Dollars 20bn.
Last autumn, western credit agencies ignored Bank Markazi's argument that
because the banks are all state-owned, their guarantee is as good as one
from Bank Markazi itself. They have called upon Iran's Ministry of Economy
and Finance to guarantee payment for projects worth more than Dollars 50m.
Other problems include a lack of trained managers and a weak management
structure. Capital inadequacy and deficient technological resources also
need to be tackled.
Mr Adeli has said that local banks need to be brought to international
capital adequacy standards which he indicated should be achieved by the end
of 1993. Bank Melli, for example, the country's largest bank after Bank
Markazi, is ranked within the top 100 banks in the world because of the size
of its assets - Dollars 125.8bn at the end of March 1991, according to The
Banker - but is ranked by The Banker 383 in the world due to its capital
assets ratio of 0.43 per cent.
Despite the drawbacks, Iran's banking system maintains many of its positive
features. It is long-established and well-developed compared to many
countries in the Middle East - a system with a wide branch network
throughout the world reflecting the importance of trade to the country.
Despite all the economic problems and political turmoil, the banking system
has proved itself resilient and resourceful.

TRADE is vital to Iran's reconstruction. The eight-year war with Iraq eroded
the country's productive capacities and, since the end of the war, the
government has increased imports of raw materials for factories as well as
consumption goods.
Imports rose steadily from a low of Dollars 9.5bn in 1988 to more than
Dollars 26bn in 1991-92.
The composition of Iran's main trading partners shifted as a result of the
revolution but not as much as the rhetoric from Tehran, with its emphasis on
relations with Third World countries, might suggest.
Before the revolution, 85 per cent of Iran's trade was with Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. That proportion is
now down to a still sizeable 75 per cent. Germany and Japan head the list.
Trade with other countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, has become
more important to Iran. Dubai's free port and its proximity to Iran have
made it a busy re-export point for goods destined for Iran. Imports from the
UAE, particularly of luxuries and consumer goods, have increased
substantially since the end of the Iran-Iraq war in 1988. They grew from
Dollars 276m to Dollars 949m in the space of a year and now account for more
than Dollars 1bn in Iranian imports.
The increase in trade has been helped by a relaxation of Iran's import and
export rules and higher foreign exchange earnings as a result of increased
oil prices particularly since the 1991 US-led war against Iraq.
The bulk of exports and imports are still controlled by the government,
through its approval of price and supplier. Public sector imports still
account for the majority of imports which are usually carried out by
international tender under the control of government agencies.
Imports by the private sector are still restricted although machinery, raw
materials and spare parts among others, can be imported with
government-allocated foreign exchange.
At the end of last year, the government lifted the requirement for a
government allocation of foreign currency for a variety of goods, including
electrical and electronic equipment, construction materials, metals tools
and food and textiles. Payment can be made from an overseas bank account or
with currency bought at the free market rate.
In an attempt to encourage non-oil exports, the government has limited
restrictions on the foreign exchange generated by the private sector through
exports of handicrafts, agricultural and some manufactured goods.
The Procurement and Distribution Centres, which used to control some of the
most important industries, have been dissolved in an attempt to allow market
forces to take over. In addition, Iran has been keen to encourage foreign
investment through the establishment of free trade zones in the Persian
Gulf. The largest, on Qeshm island, near the Straits of Hormuz, is intended
to attract energy-intensive industries because of the access to Qeshm's
natural gas reserves.
The government says that there has been Dollars 10bn of foreign investment
commitments but pledges have been greater than actual disbursements.
The policy of countertrade has been largely abandoned, partly because of
stiff opposition by the National Iranian Oil Company, although the
government still seeks buy-back deals.
Until last year, the difficulties of trading with Iran were outweighed by
the attractions of its immaculate payments record. However, for the first
time since the revolution, there have been prolonged delays on payment of
Iranian letters of credit and Iran's main trading partners are watching the
situation with growing unease.
Their export credit agencies have been holding a series of formal and
informal meetings with each other in an attempt to judge the severity of the
problem.
The two main factors behind the delays are thought to be the relaxation of
Bank Markazi controls on the domestic commercial banks which resulted in
unsupervised issues of letters of credit at the free market exchange rate.
Bank Markazi has argued that the problems are only to be expected until the
new system can operate smoothly.
For Iran's creditors, however, there is the greater anxiety that Tehran has
overreached itself. The government, which kept a tight rein on consumption
with great success during the war against Iraq, has been overspending.
Oil revenues in the first three quarters of 1992 are optimistically
estimated at Dollars 16.7bn with non-oil exports making up another Dollars
1.9bn. The total foreign exchange income for the year may not exceed Dollars
20bn, while imports are expected to exceed Dollars 21bn. This represents a
cutback from the Dollars 26bn imported the year before when foreign exchange
income was only Dollars 20bn. Unfortunately, oil prices have been dropping
due to Opec oversupply, making it unlikely that Iran will find it easy to
generate enough income to cover its payments debts quickly.
President Rafsanjani, who presented the budget for 1993-94 in December, set
total foreign exchange income for the year at Dollars 23.4bn but the Majlis,
which has to approve the budget, has reduced this to a more realistic
Dollars 19.8bn, of which Dollars 17bn is expected to be in oil exports. It
is estimated Iran will take one year to catch up with its short-term debt.
Hopes are that the government will either agree to refinance its debt, a
move which would be politically difficult, or will curb its imports. Iran's
main trading partners have reported a slowdown in the growth of exports
during 1992 compared with 1991 but only France recorded a real fall.
During the first three quarters of 1992, Germany, which is most exposed to
the payment delays, reported exports of more than Dollars 4bn, compared with
a total exports of Dollars 4bn for the whole of 1991.
Japanese and Italian exports slowed to a 20 per cent increase compared with
the year before. Japan exported just over Dollars 2bn in January-September
while Italy reported exports of Dollars 1.4bn in the first six months of
last year.
UK exports also increased by 20 per cent to Dollars 840m during the first
three quarters of the year. French exports, however, dropped by nearly 30
per cent during the same period to just under Dollars 600m, partly because
of increased tension in relations between the two countries.
Few banks are now willing to take Iranian risk and billions of dollars'
worth of project finance is now in limbo until the delays are sorted out.
Iran's previously good payments record may yet reassure its trading partners
and there have, as yet, been no claims on the export credit agencies.
However, Iran's ability to manage its mounting debt will be watched
carefully.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (6): A sudden flurry of alarmist warnings -
Defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE eight-year war between Iran and Iraq offered much satisfaction to
strategic planners anxious to prevent either country achieving a clear
military superiority in the region. Few tears were shed in western capitals,
particularly Washington, when President Saddam Hussein sent his forces
across the border into southern Iran in September 1980.
A conflict which absorbed and eventually came close to exhausting Iran's
Islamic revolution was not to be discouraged.
When Saddam's troops were eventually thrown back across the border and Iraq
became locked in a six-year defensive battle, the pro-Baghdad tilt in the
west became more obvious.
Initially, at least, there was no confusion about the type of regime run by
the Iraqi leader, or about the solely pragmatic need to keep Iraq out of
Tehran's clutches. If, after the 1988 ceasefire, commercial greed got in the
way of political perspective it was brought to a sudden halt by Saddam's
decision to invade Kuwait.
The invasions of 1980 and 1990 rested on the mistaken assumption by Saddam
Hussein that his forces were superior to anything likely to be sent against
them. Neither adventure would have been attempted before the Iranian
revolution when the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's armed forces enabled
Tehran to impose conditions on Baghdad - such as the 1975 Algiers agreement
covering the Shatt al-Arab waterway.
The sudden flurry of alarmist warnings about the military ambitions of Iran
indicate that for some people the pendulum may now have swung back too far
in the direction of Tehran. Since being ejected from Kuwait in February
1991, Iraq has not posed a serious military threat to its neighbours.
The recent response by the western alliance to Iraq's challenges to the air
exclusion zones underlines how greatly reduced Baghdad's military capacity
has become. It can defy UN Security Council resolutions and threaten its own
people, but the quantity and sophistication of allied equipment in Saudi
Arabia, the Gulf and Kuwait offers considerable reassurance to Iraq's
smaller neighbours.
Iran may once more be militarily stronger than Iraq, but both are
considerably weaker than they have been. Tehran points out that it has never
attacked anyone but has several times been the victim of aggression. It
insists that it has no territorial ambitions, no intention to acquire
nuclear weapons technology, and has a very limited arms-buying budget,
especially when compared with that of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Officials say
that rebuilding the economy has a higher priority than developing the armed
forces.
Some of its recent purchases have nonetheless caused public concern in the
west, most particularly the arrival in Iran late last year of its first
Russian-built Kilo-class submarine.
Privately, military analysts are far less worried and dismiss suggestions
that one or more submarines will have much impact on the military balance in
the region. 'In effect it will be easy to track, probably poorly operated,
and can be dealt with swiftly if ever there was a need', said a former naval
officer with long experience of the region.
Iran has also taken advantage of Russia's need for hard currency by
acquiring a number of Mig-29 aircraft and T-72 tanks. China has sold Scud
missiles to Iran, together with F-7 jets which are modernised versions of
the ageing Mig-21. But as Mr Akbar Torkan, minister of defence, makes clear,
Iran's overwhelming need is spare parts for equipment bought from the US
before 1979. Even given modest success in buying spares, Iran's military
capacity will remain substantially below the levels attained 15 years ago.
Tehran also has to face a growing technological gap, not just in weaponry
but in command and communications equipment. It was this deficiency which
contributed to its inability to score a decisive breakthrough on the
southern front during the war with Iraq.
Another weakness, probably still not rectified, is the command structure of
the armed forces and the extent to which the regular army and the
Revolutionary Guards Corps is capable of working harmoniously together. The
regular army is unlikely ever to enjoy the same level of confidence among
the country's senior clergy as that bestowed on the Revolutionary Guards
Corps which is said still to be allowed the pick of new weapons.
The picture painted by some intelligence agencies of a more belligerent
Iran, bent on military expansion, is also difficult to square with the
political mood in the country.
The shocking casualty list caused by nine years of revolution and war has
contributed to a weariness with conflict which will not easily be overcome.
There is no doubt that the regime will fight vigorously to protect the
revolution if challenged, but there is little evidence to suggest that there
would be much popular backing for foreign conflicts. On the contrary, the
regime is constantly demonstrating that it believes supplying the domestic
market with consumer goods makes better political sense than re-arming on a
large scale.
The US and its allies wish to avoid repeating the mistakes they made in
assessing the intentions of President Saddam Hussein. But, by being so
noisily suspicious of Iran, there is a danger of focusing excessively on the
military threat when it is the battle of ideas which could more seriously
damage western interests throughout the Middle East.

On the organisation of the armed forces:
The spiritual leader oversees all the armed forces including the army, the
Revolutionary Guards Corps and the police. The army and the revolutionary
guards each control their own forces.
The army has the responsibility for maintaining Iran's territorial
integrity. The revolutionary guards corps has both a cultural and a military
mission. Its main role is to safeguard the achievements of the Islamic
revolution but it will, of course, assist the army if required. The
revolutionary guards oversee the baseej, the volunteer force. The purpose of
the baseej is to provide military training and organisation for all
civilians so if there is a need to take up arms they will be ready to do so.
Strengths of the armed forces:
The number serving in the army now is 200,000. That does not take into
account those who have been drafted into the army.
The numbers of the revolutionary guards depends on how many are
participating through the baseej. Our late Imam Khomeini said we had to
provide military training for everybody. Every Moslem should be ready to
defend his country. Because of this we can maintain a relatively low number
of experts in the army. These are men who can operate state-of-the-art, very
sophisticated equipment. But when it is time to defend the revolution each
and every person would take up arms. It is a religious duty which falls upon
everyone.
On reducing the size of the army:
To maintain a great army in terms of numbers you must have a very prosperous
economy. We are in the middle of reconstructing our country. So we have to
find a way of remaining strong while limiting spending. The solution to that
is the baseej. As a result, the number of people with full-time army careers
can be cut, but we will retain personnel with high technical ability.
The future for conscription:
It has to undergo certain changes. We began the process three years ago.
Those people who will be drafted this year were born in 1971. In that year,
1.3m people were born in Iran. From that number there are 600,000 young men
available to be drafted. If we were to take this number of people into the
army it would mean that over two years we would have to cope with 1.2m men.
The capacity of our bases and garrisons is not sufficient. Neither do we
have the money to feed those people. Therefore a large number are set aside
for other services.
For example, we have a service called GI-teacher, there is another linked to
health care and a third involved with literacy. Soldiers who have a diploma
of education would be set aside for teaching. Others go to help with the
reconstruction work in villages.
All have to undergo 45 days of military schooling before being sent off.
Military expenditure:
I would very much like the Dollars 2bn a year talked about in the west. But
I do not get that. This year we have Dollars 750m in actual dollars and
rather less than the equivalent of Dollars 1bn in rials. We would like to
receive more.
The build-up of arms in the region:
In the past three or four years, most conflicts in the world have come to an
end. The great wars have concluded, such as in Cambodia and between Iran and
Iraq. But countries which produce armaments need a market for them. Some of
the countries around the Persian Gulf are very rich. So the arms producers
have to think of ways to get those petrodollars. Accordingly, they produce
some phantom threat to try to scare those countries. They force them to sign
very big arms deals. This does not make us feel threatened.
Around us we do not see any country which would be a threat. We have the
best of relations with Pakistan. Afghanistan is a poor country which for the
next 20 years will have to spend whatever money it has on reconstruction. We
have very good relations with Turkey and equally the Turks do not feel we
are a threat to them. Iraq is a country which is trying to avoid being
dismembered. The countries to the south of us are very small and weak and
need us to help defend them. So no-one is threatening us. Our priority is to
rebuild the country.
US forces in the Gulf:
The Americans would not attack us militarily. People living in glass houses
do not throw stones. The US does not have any reason to attack us. They come
to the region to get as much Arab money as they can. And even if the
Americans did want to attack us they would not do so in a classic military
movement. Can our air force, for example, take on the Americans, or our navy
take on the American navy? If we put all of our country's budget into such a
war we would have just burned our money. The way to go about dealing with
such a threat requires a different solution entirely.
Iraq, the no-fly zones and US intentions:
Even if Iraq is cut into three parts it does not necessarily threaten our
interests. Of course, we are very much against the disintegration of Iraq.
But I do not subscribe to the view that the Americans are looking for
trouble and want to attack us. Right now the Americans have many problems
throughout the world and have to deal with them first.
With Mr Clinton taking power I think that America will scale back its
adventurism abroad and will start work on its own country. Clinton, for
instance, has announced that he is reducing the number of navy fleets from
12 to 10. And the number of US troops with the Nato forces will be reduced
to 75,000.
The US budget for military purposes is Dollars 250bn. Its economy at the
moment cannot sustain such a budget. The Americans have to deal with these
problems first. It is not logical for a country which is reducing its
military bases around the world, and wants to reduce its military budget, to
attack us. At the same time we do not want to enter a war with the Americans
either.
Iran's military shopping list:
The first priority is spare parts, the second priority is spare parts, and
the third priority is spare parts. Our equipment is mostly American; F-4,
F-5, F-14 fighter jets. Our transport aircraft are also American; C-130s,
Boeing 707s and 747s. We have a very good fleet: 14 707s, 12 747s and 53
C-130s. This should be enough to see us through the next 20 years. The only
problem for us is to provide spare parts in order to keep them flying.
For example, we have 72 F-14s. This is the best air superiority that money
can buy. In the next 20 years nothing will be its competitor. Therefore we
should only be thinking about buying spare parts to maintain our present
fleet. For closer support, we have F-5 fighters and for deep strikes F-4
fighters. This is a very good configuration. We still have 750 helicopters.
I personally think that we still have the third largest fleet in the world.
Unfortunately, because our fleet is mainly made up of American products,
providing spares is very difficult. Of course, we also have some Soviet-made
armaments, but very few.
Cheap Soviet equipment:
We have bought some tanks from the Russians, but the days of tank warfare
are numbered. Iraq, in its conflict with the US, showed that tanks are not
much use any more. Since the advent of attack helicopters, tanks are
becoming useless. But anyway we have bought a number.
We have also bought F-7 fighters from China which compare to the MiG-21. The
main reason for buying those Chinese fighters is to fulfil the number of
flight hours that our pilots must have. Missile purchases:
Scud B missiles cost Dollars 2.5m each so it is a very large investment and
the outcome of any war would not be decided by such weapons. But our
technological capability is such that if we require similar missiles then we
can manufacture them ourselves.
Submarines and their impact on the strategic balance:
The price tag mentioned in the western media recently of Dollars 250m for a
submarine is not correct. Before the revolution, a German company sold us
six submarines. The Americans sold us two. But they did not deliver. We have
bought our Russian submarines at a substantially lower price than was
mentioned. All we are doing is to fill the gaps in our military plan. A
complete system is made up of different components. Most of the other
components had been bought before the revolution. Submarines were the one
component that was missing, and we are now buying them.
The development of military industries:
Only a very few countries, such as America, Russia, China and France can
produce all their requirements. The rest produce only a fraction. It might
be possible for us to build tanks, submarines, missiles, aircraft and such
like. But self-sufficiency is relative. We think of self-sufficiency in
terms of those items which we use a lot, especially the sort of equipment we
employed most during the war. And in any economic venture the finished price
is very important.
For instance, if we followed a programme of self-sufficiency and decided to
produce something locally it might cost Dollars 5,000 whereas we might be
able to buy the same thing abroad for Dollars 1,000. This would not make
economic sense.
The aircraft flown to Iran during the Gulf war:
We have handed back the civilian aircraft, including the Kuwaiti aircraft.
Unfortunately, the Kuwaitis did not even pay us the maintenance and parking
expenses for their aircraft, but we thought that if we kept those aircraft
parked in Tehran much longer it would not reflect well on us
internationally. Of course, a number of Iraqi fighter jets also intruded on
Iranian airspace.
The civilian aircraft asked permission first which is why we handed them
back. But we still have not decided whether to hand over the fighter jets.
We have to wait for the UN sanctions committee to see what they have to say.
I am sure they will do something about the expenses incurred in having those
Iraqi planes in Iran and will take appropriate measures.
Because the fighter jets are of a make which we do not have in our air
force, our ground personnel have been unable to keep them flight ready. None
of those fighters can fly any more. An aircraft is like a living being. You
cannot just leave it in the desert and then push the starter button when you
want to fly.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (4): Damage limitation - The Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After nearly a decade in the economic doldrums caused first by revolution
and then war, Iran faced the massive task in the summer of 1988 of
rebuilding its infrastructure, its cities and villages occupied or bombed by
Iraq, and most critically its oil production and export facilities.
Unlike Iraq, the Iranian regime at least emerged from the conflict without
the huge weight of debt which proved so difficult for President Saddam
Hussein to tolerate and helped spur the invasion of Kuwait. Whatever else
was said about Iran during the 1980s, its management of its external
finances drew almost universal praise. Iran paid its debts promptly and was
a sound risk.
Probably the biggest single error made by the government in the past four
years has been to put that hard-won reputation at risk. Iran's
reconstruction and economic development plans need access to western
capital. There is, of course, a substantial amount that can be generated
domestically, but with annual hard currency revenues unlikely to top Dollars
16bn-Dollars 17bn in the next few years, the demands for investment have to
take their place in the queue along with other pressing priorities. In the
oil and industrial sectors, along with the free trade zones, it has been
hoped that a significant part of the investment would come from outside the
country.
How much damage has been done to those prospects is not yet clear. But the
alarm bells are ringing in all the leading export credit guarantee agencies
of the industrialised world. What had been nervousness six months ago has
now developed into deep concern and the strong possibility exists that one
of the biggest agencies could soon remove cover for Iran.
Iran's problems grew from its attempt to undertake a multi-billion-dollar
reconstruction programme using primarily short-term loans and its loss of
control over letters of credit issued by the commercial banks. Added to this
has been the opportunity to buy cut-price Russian weaponry for cash.
The situation might have been more manageable had oil revenues come up to
expectations. Instead, the surge in prices that followed Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990 was enough to tempt Iran into a more expansive spending
programme, but not enough to sustain it.
Official figures need to be treated with some caution, but the trends are
clear enough. At the end of the last financial year (March 21, 1991) Iran
admitted to oil revenues of Dollars 15.8bn and imports of nearly Dollars
25bn. In fact, imports were probably Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn higher than
stated and, even allowing for non-oil exports of Dollars 2bn, this would
still have left the country with a trade deficit of more than Dollars 10bn.
The first hint that Iran was having difficulties meeting short-term
obligations emerged about nine months ago - and seemed to have reached a
plateau over the summer, but again gathered pace in November and December.
Officials from Bank Markazi, the central bank, travelled to Japan, Germany
and other European countries at the end of the year in an attempt to
reassure foreign banks and export credit agencies that the difficulty was
primarily technical and would be resolved within a few months. In Tehran,
close aides of President Rafsanjani admitted the problem, but not its size.
They say an inquiry is underway into banking practices and accounting
procedures.
What appears to have happened is that the central bank, having permitted the
commercial banks to open letters of credit without official approval, did
not have in place a mechanism for tracking the volumes and amounts which
were then issued. At the same time, foreign currency allocations to
ministries increased sharply.
The effects on Iran are visible. The country is in the middle of its biggest
consumer boom since well before the revolution and so far there is no sign
of it running out of steam.
Officials insist that 50 per cent fewer letters of credit have been issued
in the current financial year and there will be a correspondingly large fall
in the value of imports. Even if this is so, it will not resolve the more
immediate issue over the swelling backlog of unpaid letters of credit. The
government says that there is no more than Dollars 1bn outstanding. Other
western estimates put the figure at closer to Dollars 3bn, and fear that
there is a substantial sum still in the pipeline which could range between
Dollars 7bn and Dollars 10bn, anywhere from a half to two-thirds of expected
oil revenues.
Iran has hinted at some success in re-financing part of the outstanding
amount and officials in Tehran want to believe that competition between
countries for business will prevent the crisis from deepening. Much the same
thinking lies behind Iran's refusal to accept growing western demands for
sovereign guarantees for new loans. A large part of the outstanding
short-term debt could probably be converted into much longer maturities if
Iran would guarantee the amounts.
Similarly, the prospects for financing some of the country's most ambitious
infrastructure and industrial projects would look much more feasible if
investors were provided with that extra reassurance.
But awareness of the hostility of the parliament to sovereign borrowing  -
smacking as it does of foreign dependence - makes the government reluctant
to introduce the issue. It is also probable that relatively few people in
Tehran are fully aware of the amounts outstanding on short-term repayments.
The government claims greater success in handling the scarcely less
sensitive issue of exchange rates. In his budget speech in December, Mr
Rafsanjani pledged further moves to unify the exchange rate by removing an
increasing number of items from the official rate of IR70 to the dollar.
Only essential items, such as basic foodstuffs and medicines, will remain at
that IR70 rate, some items for industry will continue at IR600 to the dollar
but almost everything else will be at the floating rate, currently about
IR1,500 to the dollar.
Moving all items on to the floating rate would have a hugely inflationary
impact, especially as at least 20 per cent of imports are believed to fall
into the category of basic goods and medicines.
How far down this road Mr Rafsanjani is willing to venture will be primarily
a political judgment. The government is preparing to increase subsidies
massively as more basic items are moved onto the floating rate. It also
claims to be holding enough dollars in reserve to satisfy demand and steady
the rate when the rial is finally fully floated.
If the government intends to keep its pledge to the International Monetary
Fund in order to qualify for balance of payments support it has to unify
exchange rates by March next year.
Some officials at the central bank want the government to act more
decisively. They believe a short, sharp adjustment, although painful, is
preferable to a long drawn-out process during which the impact of the
reforms will be dissipated. The Ministry of Finance and Economy clearly
prefers the more cautious approach and so far seems to be winning the
argument.
What impact the gravity of Iran's external payments situation will have on
the government's room for manoeuvre will be the main focus of attention over
the next six months.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (5): Recovery package - Mr Mohsen Nourbaksh,
minister of economy and finance, talks to Roger Matthews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Overall economic strategy:
In 1989-90, at the beginning of our first five-year plan, we tried to deal
with the lack of balance in the economy. The priorities in the package for
economic recovery included adjusting prices, diminishing the role of
government, encouraging the private sector and developing exports.
The private sector existed before the revolution and has its own role
defined in our constitution. It is important to differentiate between east
European countries and Iran. There has been a tendency to see the package of
measures here as the same as those put forward by the IMF and World Bank for
countries in eastern Europe. Our country is very different.
One of the main issues with which we are struggling is the unification of
exchange rates. The big difference between the official and floating rates
of exchange is one of the legacies we suffered from the war. We are trying
to move very smoothly towards unification of rates. Most of the industrial
sector, so far as the production side is concerned, is using the floating
rate, as is the trade sector. Assuming that parliament approves the budget
we will have taken a very major step towards unification.
We are generally pleased with the result of these policies so far as
investment is concerned. Over the past two years the average growth in GDP
has been more than 11 per cent, almost 3 per cent above what was predicted.
Most of the growth has come from agriculture, industry and oil. We think the
momentum will continue in the current year and we will have a GDP growth
rate of about 8 per cent. Some Dollars 24bn has been invested in different
sectors over the past three years. We think that we will be able to continue
on the same growth pattern in the future.
Unification of exchange rates:
Not all rates can be unified in the budget. There are some specific parts of
the budget that will remain at the official rate. But in 1993 we will take
the major step towards unifying exchange rates.
On the inflationary impact of unifying exchange rates:
We intend to use subsidies, especially for essential goods and medicines, so
that the cost of living does not rise too much. Most other imports are
already on the floating rate, so there should not be much impact on prices.
Basic foods will continue to be imported at the official rate. About 20 per
cent will remain at the official rate. In other words, about 80 per cent
will have changed. The only items that will be subsidised are those few
remaining at the official rate of exchange.
Use of subsidies:
There are no plans at this stage to make subsidies more selective. Right now
we subsidise many items, for example refrigerators and televisions, by
allowing them to be imported at the official rate of exchange. By going over
to the floating rate we remove this type of subsidy.
Impact of current account deficit:
Unifying exchange rates will help to reduce the deficit. Our prediction is
that next year we will definitely have a positive balance of payments. Total
expenditure in foreign exchange will be less than our predicted income,
assuming that the price of oil is maintained.
Imports for last year were running at Dollars 26bn-Dollars 27bn, but this
financial year they are much lower, particularly because we have introduced
the floating rate for the industrial sector. Since the beginning of this
current year (March 21), when we introduced the floating exchange rate,
consumption of foreign currency has fallen tremendously. Our estimate for
the current year is that we will have a positive balance of payments.
Delays on payments of letters of credit:
Last year our imports were about Dollars 26-Dollars 27bn. That was because
we introduced a floating exchange rate and allowed the commercial banks to
operate it without any restriction. The same pattern continued this year.
Because of that, and because previously we used to have a system of
rationing foreign exchange, there has been some mismanagement. We did not
intervene in the market because we thought that the pressure would diminish.
That is what is happening now.
This year, the number of letters of credit that has been opened and the
level of imports is likely to be 50 per cent lower than the previous year.
There was some interruption in payment of letters of credit but we consider
that as having a short-run effect. We are negotiating with the banks and we
think we will manage the whole thing satisfactorily. The size of the backlog
is about Dollars 1bn. Very soon we are going to resolve the whole thing. I
do not wish to give a specific time.
Position on sovereign guarantees
Commercial banks have their own business and have to issue their own
guarantees. Those banks have to be acceptable to the international
commercial banks. But if the government is going to receive a credit or
facilities, such as those we are negotiating with the World Bank or with the
Japanese for a yen loan, then this is government-to-government and we will
definitely give a guarantee.
But we do not see any reason for the government to give a guarantee for,
say, a small textile manufacturing project. Even if western credit agencies
say that we have to provide a guarantee, we are definitely not going to do
so. If they do not wish to do business with us, well we shall have to wait
and see.
Recently we got a credit from a German bank using the same standard as we
had before. We consider that as an indication that if we insist on this
policy and stick to our principles then international companies will adjust.
It is a matter of markets. We see enough competition between different
companies in different countries, so why should we adjust? It is they who
are competing. It is their duty to adjust their policy to what we need.
Privatisation:
It does not mean creating a private sector because that has always existed.
What it means is that companies which for some reason are in the hands of
government should transfer to the private sector. The main purpose is to
increase the efficiency of those companies.
We have listed more than 300 which are supposed to transfer to the private
sector. Some have been privatised but most are still in government hands. We
are trying to speed up the process. I do not consider privatisation as a
source of revenue but as a way of increasing efficiency. Ministers
responsible for running those companies are allowed to use the proceeds from
sales either for completing projects or to renovate the technology in those
companies they administer.
Prospects for foreign investment:
It is accepted without any limitation. It depends only on the nature and the
type. We offer the same protection to foreign investors as is available in
other countries. I do not have the data with me to say whether we have
received one penny of foreign investment or not, but we have received
several applications.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (2): Suspicion on all sides - Foreign Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SOMETIMES they appear with a deceitful smile, saying that they like Iran
and wish to establish ties. They are telling lies. Past experience has shown
that they are lying. They have a dagger hidden behind their backs and the
other hand is ready to plunder. We know their true nature.'
Ayatollah Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, articulated recently what is a
widely-held view in Iran of western nations and their intentions. Not
everyone would voice it so dramatically, but even among Iranians who have
long association with the US and Europe there is an ingrained readiness to
interpret western actions in the most conspiratorial way.
From Washington, elsewhere in the west and in parts of the Middle East there
has been a scarcely less instinctive willingness to view Iranian intentions
as subversive and destabilising. Mr Robert Gates, until recently director of
the CIA, thinks it probable that Iran is trying to acquire a nuclear weapon,
while the governments of Algeria and Sudan believe Tehran is funding and
encouraging Islamic fundamentalists in their countries.
The depth of suspicion on all sides makes it difficult to achieve the
progress in areas of mutual interest which President Rafsanjani and his
aides say they wish to make. There is no doubt that Iran's political
leadership has done its homework on the relationship between economic
development and foreign policy. It understands how much it needs access to
capital and technology if war damage is to be repaired, the economy
modernised, and jobs found for the large numbers of young people coming onto
the market every year.
But squaring that with the spiritual and political imperatives bequeathed by
Ayatollah Khomeini will always prove difficult for the more pragmatic
members of the Iranian establishment. Foreign policy in Iran is not made by
a single person, group or organisation. Because of that it can be subject to
domestic political rivalries, lack of management control and opportunism by
radical factions.
The example of Abu Musa island, close to the Strait of Hormuz, offers
analysts plenty of scope. At a time when Iran was being conciliatory to the
Gulf Arabs, its officials on Abu Musa - sovereignty of which is shared with
the United Arab Emirates - threw out some teachers who it claimed were a
threat to security. From there the situation deteriorated with the UAE
taking the issue to the UN and Iran frightening its neighbours again with
increasingly belligerent statements and claims of full sovereignty over the
island.
It could be that the whole episode stemmed from an unauthorised action by
Iranian officials on Abu Musa from which the government could not easily
dissociate itself. It could equally be that Iran wanted to remind the Gulf
Arabs of its presence. Tehran will not quickly forget that it was Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait which funded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein during the
Iran-Iraq war and indirectly provided the weapons used for the destruction
of Iranian cities and villages. No word has been uttered by the Arabs about
reparations, although the huge sums being spent by those two countries on
new weapons is being noted.
Iran is also sensitive to the refusal of the Gulf Co-operation Council
(Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Qatar) to
involve it in any of the security arrangements for the region, such as the
Damascus Declaration which would have given Egypt and Syria a role in the
defence of the Gulf. Tehran continues to be unhappy with Saudi Arabia's oil
production policy, believing that it is doing America's bidding by keeping
oil prices relatively low.
Taken together it is unsurprising that the Iranian regime should feel that
the US and its regional clients are attempting to exclude or marginalise its
political and economic role. It is a policy that the Iranians are bound to
resist and there are indications that an additional line of response has
been to encourage where possible the rash of territorial disputes between
GCC members in the past year.
Iran should not be surprised that other countries feel threatened by it,
however much Mr Rafsanjani's officials insist that it intends to export
nothing more subversive than ideas. Islamic fundamentalism is gaining
adherents in the Middle East and does pose the single most easily
identifiable threat to several regimes. The question all these regimes seek
to answer is how much the process is being aided by Tehran.
In Sudan and Lebanon there is a clear Iranian presence. The Iranians make no
secret of their support for Hammas in the occupied territories and their
total opposition to the US-sponsored Middle East peace process. They are
privately very contemptuous of the Gulf monarchies and are trying hard to
expand political and commercial ties with the central Asian republics.
Iran has bought weapons from China and made overtures to North Korea. Its
list of activities may be in keeping with a wholly independent foreign
policy, but not one likely to promote closer relations with western nations.
Seen from Tehran, that is not Iran's problem. If there is agreement on
anything in Iran, it is that other countries must adjust to the reality of
the Islamic revolution.
At the same time Iran will be acutely sensitive to anything which hints at
paternalism, neo-colonialism or even criticism of its domestic affairs,
especially if related to human rights. And it sees nothing contradictory in
sentencing to death a British author accused of blasphemy.
The importance of the Iranian market at a time of world recession has
encouraged western governments to adjust to these difficulties except, as in
the case of Britain, when the issue of Salman Rushdie so angered public
opinion that it was bound to drive a wedge between the two countries.
Lack of a firm reassurance by Iran about its current intentions towards Mr
Rushdie will continue to hinder the chances of any improvement.
Such incidents seem likely to remain an unpredictable element in Iran's
dealings with the rest of the world and will continue to jeopardise the
prospects for more durable relations.

<TEXT>
On the improvement of Iran's relations with the west during the Kuwait
crisis and the subsequent deterioration:
I was not much impressed by the kind of overtures that came from the west
when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Nor am I much disturbed by recent political
unhappiness. It is better for us to stick to our principles and come to
terms with our external environment rather than trying to calculate when the
world is happy with us and when the world is not happy with us.
The relevance of Iran's 'Neither east nor west' policy following the
collapse of the Soviet Union:
It is still a relevant policy but maybe the way we express it should be
changed. Its main purpose is to convey the idea that we decide in Tehran
what our interests are and that we should not be expected to kneel down in
front of foreign powers. It is part of our sense of national sovereignty. It
does not mean we should be antagonistic towards anybody outside Iran. We are
a member of the international community. In the international community you
cannot do whatever you like, or whatever you think is right for your own
interests. There is a sort of game which we should start to play, and we are
playing it.
Whether US and British ambassadors might return to Tehran:
There is no big obstacle preventing better relations with the west, other
than political attitudes. This is mainly the responsibility of our western
partners. There is still a cultural barrier, a sense that someone can
dictate to other parts of the world about how they should behave.
Economically, relations are beneficial for both sides. But politically the
international situation is still not mature enough, especially with the type
of disorder now affecting the world community. The laws of the new game are
not well defined. We have a game in which the rules are changing and the
players also are changing. So anyone can claim victory, even though they may
not be winning. We should just stick to our principles and when the fruit is
ripe then it could be picked from the tree. We should not rush.
Is foreign policy still guided by the desire to aid oppressed Moslems
anywhere in the world?
This is a fabulous principle that anyone in the world should help the needy,
the oppressed and the poor.
This does not mean we are going to topple the governments of other countries
if we think that they do not behave according to our standards. It does not
mean that we are going to interfere with their daily affairs. That is the
way the west behaves towards us and to other countries.
In practice the basis of our decisions is our national interest. To rebuild
the country we have a long way to go. We are determined to convert Iran into
a prosperous and advanced country. We are putting all our efforts into that.
The ideas which guide our country are attracting followers in many Islamic
countries. In Egypt, there is a movement which they branded fundamentalism.
We like the word fundamentalism. It shows that people are concerned with the
deep issues and fundamental truths.
This movement is like a renaissance. It is true that it started from Iran
and the waves are spreading. It is disturbing a number of governments in
Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt. But it is simplistic and naive for those
governments to blame Iran because our ideas have followers. We are pleased
that what we do is admired in the Islamic world but this is not something we
can be blamed for.
The Islamic world is undergoing a deep change and our revolution played a
major role in expediting this change. The more suppressed it is, the greater
momentum it will have, and the more it will become radicalised. This is the
source of suspicion about Iran. Politicians in America think it is like a
commodity which we export to other countries. But this is not the reality.
US paranoia about Iran stems from such very simplistic views.
Role of the armed forces:
We must calculate the threat and consider what would be a reasonable
defence. We have been the victim of a notorious aggression after the
revolution. The mastermind of this aggression is alive and is still in power
in Baghdad. No reasonable person would be willing to be caught again by
surprise.
On the southern flank of the Persian Gulf billions of dollars have been
invested in armaments. We worry about this. Who is going to be the target
for all this? Can the Kuwaitis by buying arms defend themselves again
against Iraqi aggression? We doubt it.
We see ourselves as a country surrounded by turmoil and tension and
potentially threatened by a neighbour with a proven appetite for aggression.
So we need a reliable defence facility. Unfortunately, from the point of
view of the generals, our priority is the construction of the country. So we
are working towards an army which is small but efficient. We think that the
best thing that Iran can offer the Islamic world is its global ideas and
this is already taking us into the hearts of millions of Moslems.
We do not need to send troops. Our troops are our ideas, and we are very
proud that our ideas are getting through. People like us throughout the
Islamic world; the intellectuals admire us, and we feel very happy about
that. There is not a single politician in Iran contemplating expanding
Iran's geography.
Iran's attitude to nuclear weapons:
We have no nuclear ambitions. It is neither feasible to invest huge amounts
of capital in it, nor would it be effective in our defence. But I do think
it is the right of Iran to have access to nuclear technology for totally
civilian and peaceful uses. Like any other major area of science and
technology, no-one should deprive us from acquiring that possibility. But we
will not be pressing too hard because we do have alternative sources of
energy.
The Middle East peace process:
Our opposition to the process is twofold. First, on its feasibility, and
second on issues of principle and ideology.
The idea of this peace process is that it should begin to resolve the
problems of Israel with its neighbouring countries, one by one. If that is
done we are left with the helpless people of Palestine. What can they do? We
think this is very unfair to them and that the resolution of their fate
should precede any other discussion.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (1): Keen to leave the cold - Iran is edging
back towards the international mainstream. Whether it will be admitted is
another matter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When an Iranian diplomat asks earnestly 'What do you think my country can do
to improve its international image?' it is obvious that something is afoot
in the world's first Islamic republic.
For more than a decade Iran's clerical leaders have done their best to give
the impression of caring not a jot what the rest of the world thinks of
them. Some still do not. Others, however, have begun better to appreciate
the demands of administering a state of 60m people, and understand that
satisfying popular needs is one of the keys to retaining power.
There are plenty of straws in the wind. President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani is receiving weekly lessons in economics. Privatisation,
deregulation and liberalisation have entered the vocabularies of members of
parliament.
Senior officials discuss western political philosophers, and mullahs are
being been sent abroad for months at a time to live and study in western
democracies.
If that gives the impression of a country wanting to come in from the
diplomatic cold, into which it had cast itself, that is probably what is
intended. But whether Iran will be admitted while carrying so much other
ideological baggage and still festooned with labels hostile to the west is
another matter.
The motivation for Iran's shift in attitude is almost exclusively economic.
Back in the mid-1970s, Iranians used to talk portentously of their country
becoming the world's fifth power. Fanciful perhaps, but it is a reminder of
the huge potential that population, hydrocarbons, agriculture and geography
give the country. Revolution and war may have set back Iran's development by
20 years or more, but the fundamentals remain strong. How effectively they
can be exploited will depend in large measure on the political balance
within the country and how the rest of the world reacts to it.
Iran is at the moment the embodiment of the only political idea that is
gaining adherents in the Middle East. Islamic fundamentalism is being
promoted as an alternative for peoples frustrated and oppressed by
governments which offer them little hope, politically or economically. It is
a source of pride to Iran's leaders that others seek to follow their
example, and a boost to their own political legitimacy at home. Equally, it
is a source of fear and suspicion elsewhere in the region and in the west.
The freeing of western hostages in Lebanon and Iran's stance during the
Allies' war with Iraq improved its political standing in the west. The
increasing numbers of businessmen travelling profitably to Tehran helped
Iran to be seen again as an important regional economic centre. But the
positive swing of the pendulum has already been checked and, if anything, it
is again heading back in the opposite direction.
The history of the regime predisposes many people and governments to believe
the worst of it. Its record on human rights, its willingness to accept huge
casualties through frontal infantry assaults during the war with Iraq, and
its readiness to encourage the overthrow of governments it does not like
will not quickly be forgotten.
So when it appears to behave aggressively over the island of Abu Musa in the
Gulf, purchases a submarine from Russia and expresses a desire to acquire
nuclear technology, this can be translated all too easily into the picture
of a nation bent on exporting its revolution, threatening its wealthy Arab
neighbours and posing a long-term military challenge to the US.
One sure thing is that for the foreseeable future Iran will continue to
provide ammunition for those who see the country in that light. The most
virulent revolutionary rhetoric is available for those who wish to hear it
and there is always a ready domestic audience for accusations of duplicity
and subversion by Iran's enemies. The hardcore supporters of the revolution
will be rallied more effectively by invoking anti-Americanism than by
pragmatism and conciliation.
The skill of President Rafsanjani during the past three years has been to
consolidate his own position domestically while edging the country back
towards the international mainstream. How much further he can carry that
process may well depend on his ability to extricate the government from the
consequences of economic mismanagement during the past two years.
It was understandable that any improvement in oil prices would be used as an
opportunity to relax imports and provide some of the consumer goods which
had been absent for so long. But what could not be foreseen was that the
import boom would gain such momentum and that precious hard currency
earnings would be dissipated with such little supervision.
The import brakes have now been applied but not before the country has run
up many billions of dollars in short-term debt and seriously damaged its
reputation with foreign banks and the world's leading export credit
guarantee agencies. Delays on letters of credit extend up to four months and
involve Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn, with substantially more in the pipeline.
Oil revenues ensure that Iran will eventually meet its obligations, but all
foreign creditors will be looking far more sceptically at becoming further
involved in a country where political risk factors need to be offset by an
exemplary record on financial obligations.
It also raises other basic questions about the competence of government in
Iran which have implications for the rest of the Islamic world. The
constitution was designed under the tutelage of Ayatollah Khomeini to ensure
a number of parallel and overlapping areas of authority, all of which are
subservient to the country's spiritual leader. His death confirmed the
vacuum that such a system always seemed likely to create. Ayatollah Ali
Sayed Khamenei was not Ayatollah Khomeini's first choice as his successor
and will never enjoy the same religious and political authority.
This flaw at the very centre of constitutional power persists throughout the
machinery of administration and is made worse by the widespread weakness in
basic management skills. Incentives for capable people to enter government
service are few, with low salaries and a time-consuming politicisation of
departments. One of the consequences has been additional layers of
bureaucracy and a growing requirement for extra payments to help oil the
wheels of government.
Powerful individuals have shown ways of cutting through the layers of
administration, but they are few. Mr Gholamhossain Karbaschi, the mayor of
Tehran and close associate of President Rafsanjani, has made a notable
impact on the appearance and administration of the capital. He has also
raised revenue through controversial business taxes and admits to having
acquired enemies. The system permits the emergence of such people, but few
are willing to take the risk, or feel sufficiently confident of their
patron.
The danger for Iran is that the drive for economic modernisation initiated
by President Rafsanjani will suffer further losses of momentum and
eventually be broken on the inertia of the system, the incompetence of local
management and the deep conservatism of the senior clergy. Also pushing it
in that direction is the manner in which much of the industrialised world
reacts to Iran. If, as expected, Islamic fundamentalism further establishes
itself as the main perceived threat to western interests in the Middle East,
Iran is bound to suffer the backlash, however ill or well-deserved.
Certainly, nothing will be made easy for the republic. The failure of
Islamic government in Iran would be a blow to fundamentalist groups
throughout the Middle East. But an Iran rebuffed and blocked in its efforts
to make modest improvements in its international relations could make an
even more uncomfortable neighbour. The clergy and their allies have
demonstrated a political durability that many people doubted a few years
ago. Setbacks in running a modern economy will only intensify the
determination to protect the revolution, by whatever means.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Following the cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange dealers will be coming to terms this week with the
implications of last week's cut in the Bundesbank's officially posted
interest rates, writes James Blitz.
The 0.25 percentage point cut in the Bundesbank's Discount rate, to 8.0 per
cent, was hailed by some analysts as the strongest indication yet that the
German authorities would defend the European exchange rate mechanism at any
cost.
'It was a sign to me that the Bundesbank is digging in its heels, perhaps
avoiding an assault on the Franc by drawing a line at the Danish krone,'
said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, said that the
Bundesbank would probably fail in its task.
'The Bundesbank has bought time but it has not solved the fundamental
problem that France and Denmark have high interest rates in the thick of a
recession,' he said.
'As far as I am concerned, the ERM is history,' he added. He predicted that
there would soon be free floating currencies in Europe, for a limited period
at least.
The markets will have a chance to asses how quickly the German authorities
are prepared to reduce rates at this week's money market tender on
Wednesday. Last week, the lowest accepted money market bid was 8.57 per
cent. With the Discount floor lowered last week, there is speculation that
the repo rate will come down.
Another factor adding to ERM tensions is that the dollar failed to break
above DM1.67 against the D-Mark following a non-farm payroll figure on
Friday that was worse than the market expected.
This week's January retail sales figures in the US, due out on Thursday,
should indicate whether there is any more scale to the economic upturn in
the US.
But a concern for European policy-makers must be that, if the D-Mark remains
strong against the US dollar, the tensions in Europe will persist.

RESULTS DUE
THE RESULTS season springs to life on Thursday with a handful of the UK's
largest companies reporting. British Petroleum's figures should show it has
begun to recover from its recent nadir. Having halved the 4.2p quarterly
dividend at the half-way stage, a further 2.1p is expected for the final
quarter, making 10.5p (16.8p) for the year.
With historical cost profits of Pounds 100m forecast for the final quarter,
losses for the year are expected to be Pounds 487m (profits Pounds 1.2bn).
Last year, BP heavily restructured management and operations while chemical
markets remained poor, refining was mediocore and upstream operations went
well thanks to the dollar and increased output. After several quarters of
negative cashflow, it is expected to have been cash neutral in the final
quarter.
Lloyds Bank, which has been most profitable of the clearing banks in recent
years, announces its full-year results for 1992 on Friday. It is the first
big clearing bank to report after bringing forward its announcement by two
weeks. Analysts anticipate pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 650m after
last year's Pounds 645m, but one estimate is of Pounds 745m.
Provisions for possible bad and doubtful debts are estimated at between
Pounds 650m and Pounds 870m, against Pounds 918m in 1991.
Reuters, the international news and information group, is expected tomorrow
to reveal an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 340m to Pounds 380m for
the year to December. Given that Reuters is sitting on a cash pile of Pounds
700m, there has been some speculation that there will be a substantial hike
in the dividend - or even a special payment. However, most interest will
centre on the group's view of the trading outlook: a cautious statement at
the interim stage gave the highly-rated shares a knock.
BT unveils its third quarter results on Thursday against intense speculation
that it intends to advance its ambitions in global communications services
by spending up to Dollars 5bn for a stake in Electronic Data Systems, the
computing services arm of General Motors.
Excitement over rumours of the deal, on which neither company will comment,
is likely to overshadow the trading figures which are expected to indicate
BT's resilience in tough trading conditions. Pre-tax profits are expected to
be Pounds 720m-Pounds 750m (Pounds 759m a year earlier).
Analysts will be watching call volume closely as an indicator of the way the
economy is moving.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Economics: Markets will study UK data to see whether
inflation is under control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S UK data, including the producer prices index tomorrow and the
retail prices index on Friday, will give some indication as to whether the
government's apparent confidence on inflation is justified.
The recent one point cut in base rates to 6 per cent led some commentators
to suggest the government was acting too hastily and that it now faces the
uncomfortable prospect of rising inflation.
The inflationary impact of the devalued pound and monetary easing has yet to
show up in the headline rate of inflation. Cuts in mortgage interest
payments drove the retail prices index lower to an annual rate of 2.6 per
cent in December, and are expected to have pushed it down even further last
month.
However, the index excluding mortgage interest payments has already shown
some hesitant upwards movement. In December it rose to within 0.3 percentage
points of the upper limit of the Treasury's target range (1-4 per cent), and
is forecast to have risen to 3.9 per cent last month.
Seasonal food prices usually rise in January, and price rises for alcoholic
drinks as Christmas offers ended may also have pushed the underlying rate
upwards.
The following are some of the other economic highlights and events of the

FT  08 FEB 93 / Australian Government Bonds: Long end may extend rally after
poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government bond market has plenty to mull over in the weeks
ahead.
Mr Paul Keating, the Australian Prime Minister, yesterday ended months of
speculation by calling a national election for March 13, saying that the
campaign would be fought on economic issues. In addition, he promised to
announce new economic policies tomorrow to 'dramatically expand business
opportunities and accelerate economic growth'.
Early last week, meanwhile, the Australian bond market sprang back to life
as good news on inflation, combined with relative currency stability,
triggered a rally at the long end.
The market has been subdued since the last easing of monetary policy in
June, when official interest rates were cut by 75 basis points to 5.75 per
cent - the 12th reduction since rates peaked at 18 per cent in January 1990.
The 10-year bond yield has hovered around 9 per cent since September - about
5 percentage points below the February 1989 peak of 14.26 per cent - but
looked unlikely to move much lower before the impending election. At the
short end, the yield on the 90-day bond has been steady at just below 6 per
cent since August, fluctuating occasionally on unfulfilled rumours that
official interest rates might be eased.
However, the yield on the long bond dipped to 8.6 per cent last week,
following the release of the December quarter Consumer Price Index figures
which showed that inflation had fallen to a 30-year low of 0.3 per cent. The
rally was helped by renewed strength at the long end in the US, and a
steadying of the Australian dollar, which has recovered from a low of 66.35
US cents in mid-January to trade at just under 68 cents.
The rally at the long end was not reflected at the short end, largely
because of indications from the Reserve Bank that official interest rates
will not be reduced because of continuing concern about the currency.
Investors were clearly impressed by the bank's statement that 'nervousness'
in the foreign exchange markets 'effectively precludes' a further easing in
monetary policy.
However, while the currency is clearly now the main criterion for further
interest rate movements, economists say the short-term outlook remains
difficult to judge.
Precedent suggests that uncertainty about the election result is likely to
exacerbate pressure on the Australian dollar caused by weak commodity prices
and reduced forecasts for world economic growth. However, the currency may
be bolstered by interest rate reductions elsewhere, which would encourage
speculative funds to flow into Australia.
The currency should also benefit from proposals by the conservative
opposition to increase the independence of the Reserve Bank and set tight
inflation targets if it wins the election.
Mr Chris Caton, chief economist at Bankers Trust Australia, says the
medium-term outlook for the dollar is positive, given the early election
date. If this view is correct, it may be possible for the authorities to
ease monetary policy after the election, or at least to avoid raising
interest rates to defend the currency.
Whichever party wins the election will seek to stimulate more robust
economic growth to reduce unemployment, currently 11.3 per cent, which is in
turn contributing to sluggish economic growth. Mr John Dawkins, the
treasurer conceded recently that growth in gross domestic product will be
limited to 2.5 per cent this year, compared with earlier forecasts of more
than 4 per cent. However, fears expressed by private sector economists that
the economy will slip back into recession have eased following encouraging
figures for retail sales and housing starts.
The government also announced last week that the deficit on the current
account declined in December, suggesting that the balance of payments may
turn out to be a less important constraint on growth than economists feared.
The encouraging conclusion is that the outlook for the long bond is bullish,
raising the prospect that a further rally to around 8 per cent may be
justified after the election. Much will depend, however, on the stability of
the currency and the course of interest rate movements overseas.

FT  08 FEB 93 / UK Gilts: Bank funding prepares for a heavy year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England has been particularly active in plying the gilt-edged
market with stock over the past fortnight. There was the Pounds 2.5bn
auction on January 27, followed on the same day by the announcement of
Pounds 550m of stock for sale. And then last week, the Bank offered a
further Pounds 750m of conventional and index-linked stocks.
Some economists calculate that the government may be fully funded already
for the current financial year, so any further gilt issuance which takes
place before March 31 may well go towards funding the very heavy borrowing
requirement for 1993-1994.
The big four gilt-edged marketmakers - BZW, Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged
(GMGE), UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and SG Warburg Securities - have provided
slightly different funding calculations, according to their respective
estimates for the amount spent on defending sterling, National Savings
sales, and bank and building society purchases of gilts.
Mr Ifty Islam, economist at BZW, estimates that there is still some Pounds
1.7bn of gilt issuance to be done this year, based on an estimated public
sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 37bn, and gross official gilt sales
of Pounds 32.35bn for full funding.
'We had been assuming that the costs of defending the pound on Black
Wednesday would see underlying reserves fall by Pounds 12bn in 1992-1993,'
says Mr Islam. However, he has since cut the estimate for the fall in
underlying reserves to Pounds 10bn, and concludes that 'rather than being
fully funded, the authorities have Pounds 1.7bn of gilt issuance remaining'.
However, economists at the other three big market-makers estimate that the
government has overfunded already. Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at GMGE,
believes the government has overfunded by about Pounds 2bn.
This is based on a PSBR forecast of Pounds 39bn and estimates that the
authorities have sold Pounds 32bn worth of gilts, Pounds 29bn of which count
as funding. If National Savings receipts contribute Pounds 4bn to funding
over the year, this leaves a required funding of Pounds 13bn.
Mr Briscoe points out that the sterling proceeds of foreign exchange
intervention to support the currency can be regarded as contributing to
funding, although these proceeds will not necessarily count within any
single financial year.
'If all intervention proceeds count as funding in this financial year, then
based on our forecast of Pounds 15bn total currency intervention, the
authorities are overfunded by Pounds 2bn,' he says.
However, he points out that the Bank will probably use every available
opportunity to sell gilts, given the heavy borrowing requirement for
1993-1994. In his view, the gilt market is likely to see another auction
between the Budget on March 16 and the financial year-end, as well as some
tranches of stock.
Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg Securities, warns that 'while we
are now fully funded, based on an estimated PSBR of Pounds 37bn, and are
eating into next year, a smallish overshoot on the PSBR could wipe out the
overfund. We could see some tranches and one more auction at the end of
March, so we could end up with some Pounds 3bn or more overfunding.'
At UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, economist Mr Philip Tyson calculates that the
overfund is in the region of Pounds 2bn so far, and that the Bank 'will take
every opportunity (to fund) given the large increase in borrowing in the
next financial year'.
Economists forecast that in the 1993-1994 financial year the Bank will have
to issue an average of Pounds 1bn of gilts a week to fund the PSBR. Hence,
it makes sense for the Bank to try to forward fund as much as possible, even
if a 'mere' Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn of forward funding looks rather
insignificant against an estimated Pounds 50bn of total gilt funding.

FT  08 FEB 93 / US Money and Credit: Investors have high hopes of Clinton
delivering goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DATE February 17, when President Clinton is due to unveil his economic
plans, is taking on immense importance for the US credit markets.
For weeks now the bond market has been rallying in the expectation that Mr
Clinton will unveil a package which seriously sets about reducing the US
federal budget deficit. February 17 will determine whether or not that faith
is well placed.
The stakes are extremely high. Mr David Hale, of Kemper Financial Services,
says it will be 'one of the most defining moments' of the Clinton Presidency
and 'there is no way to overstate the importance of the message which it
will convey, both in terms of policy substance and political themes'.
A credible message could give a further boost to the bond market rally,
while a botched job would almost certainly send the market sharply into
reverse.
For now, though, the market seems able to shrug off any amount of 'bad' news
 -that is to say good news about the US economy, which normally sends bond
prices lower on fears of inflation.
The past week has brought a further raft of evidence to support the view
that the US economy is now growing reasonably strongly: new home sales, car
sales and retail sales have been surging; the index of leading economic
indicators had its largest monthly jump in a decade in December; and factory
orders leapt 5.3 per cent in January.
Despite this, the bond market continued to rally, with the benchmark 30-year
issue ending on Friday night with a yield of 7.15 per cent, down from 7.19 a
week earlier. Several factors besides Clintonomics lie behind this strength.
Perhaps most important, investors are finally coming to accept that
inflation is not a near-term threat. Productivity improvements are helping
the economy to expand with a minimum of cost pressures, as was underlined
last week by figures showing a 4 per cent annual rate jump in productivity
in the fourth quarter.
Last Friday's much-awaited January employment report was also sufficiently
mixed - a sizeable drop in the jobless rate was due mainly to people leaving
the workforce - for the market to keep its nerve.
Renewed overseas interest in US bonds may also have been a factor in the
market's strength. Rate cuts on Thursday by both the Bundesbank and Bank of
Japan make US yields that more competitive, while the strengthening dollar
offers the possibility of currency appreciation.
Additionally, the market was bolstered by an announcement that the
government will be scaling back the size of this week's quarterly refunding
auction, to Dollars 35.5bn from November's Dollars 37bn, with the cuts
coming in the 30-year issue and 10-year maturity.
The treasury left open the question, which has been circulating in
Washington circles for more than a year, of a policy switch involving
reduced borrowing at the 30-year maturity, in the hope of lowering
stubbornly high long rates. The treasury is to do a 'thorough review' of the
borrowing mix over the next few months.
But the market's strength has also been due to the fact that just now good
economic news may also be good for bonds, since a self-reviving US will put
less pressure on Mr Clinton to produce an expensive stimulatory package (the
market is happy with signs that he is aiming for around Dollars 31bn), and
gives him more scope to cut the deficit.
The long bond is already on the point of reaching its cyclical low of 7.11
per cent, and many analysts expect it to breach the 7 per cent barrier
during 1993, taking yields to their lowest level in two decades. But first
Mr Clinton must deliver the goods.

FT  08 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Deluge of Canadian dollar issues widens
spreads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TREASURERS have rushed to raise funds in Canadian dollars in the
international capital markets in the past week or so, to take advantage of
the favourable arbitrage conditions available in the swaps market.
More than CDollars 3bn worth of paper has been raised since January 28,
bringing the total volume since the start of the year to CDollars 5.94bn.
Given the relative similarity of the deals, there has been insufficient
demand from investors to absorb the deluge of paper immediately.
Consequently, spreads on most of the new issues have widened since their
launch. The main casualty has been a CDollars 300m 10-year offering from
Asfinag, an Austrian government-guaranteed agency, which has seen its spread
widen by 8 basis points to 48 basis points above comparable Canadian
government bonds.
The City of Montreal's CDollars 125m 10-year deal and Daimler-Benz North
America's CDollars 100m three-year bond have seen their spreads widen by 7
basis points to 107 and 55 basis points respectively.
The only Canadian dollar deal to see its spread narrow has been the
Municipality of Toronto's CDollars 125m 10-year deal, by 4 basis points to
70 basis points.
The over-supply of Canadian dollar Eurobonds has been spread across the
yield curve. Of the 15 recent issues, seven have been pitched into the
10-year area, while the remaining eight have been split between three and
five-year maturities.
This has reduced the scope for further launches, although some syndicate
managers believe there might still be room in the three-year area for a
good-quality name.
The heavy activity in the swaps market, related to the flood of new issues,
has caused swap spreads to narrow. Syndicate managers say that fewer
arbitrage opportunities and a saturated market should help to cancel each
other out, since the former should discourage treasurers from raising more
funds in this currency. This in turn should give the market a chance to
digest the recent flood of paper.
Underwriters hope the overhang of Canadian dollar deals will soon be taken
up by investors. They are said to be attracted by the renewed stability of
the Canadian dollar after its fall last year, triggered by constitutional
concerns and casualties in the corporate sector.
Furthermore, the volatility in the European currency markets last week has
increased demand for paper denominated in 'safe haven' currencies such as US
and Canadian dollars.
Analysts believe Canadian government bonds look cheap against their US
counterparts. They expect the recent reduction in the yield differential
between the two to continue. In the 10-year area of the curve, for example,
the differential has narrowed to 146 basis points from 158 basis points a
week ago, and some analysts expect a further narrowing of some 60 basis
points in the coming months.
An improved outlook for the Canadian economy - its gross domestic product is
expected to grow by 3 1/2 per cent this year after an expected rise of 1 1/2
per cent in 1992 - as well as subdued inflation prospects of around 2 per
cent have also encouraged investors to return.
While the recent spate of issues has been led by foreign borrowers, some
Canadian borrowers have tapped the market. Many Canadian provinces continue
to face heavy financing needs, and could add supply to the market at a later
date.
Syndicate managers say that for Canadian borrowers there is currently not
much difference between the cost of borrowing in the domestic market and the
Eurobond market. However, if the Canadian dollar continues to recover
against European currencies, it could encourage greater demand among
European investors eager to make currency gains. This in turn could cause
Eurobond spreads to narrow, which would reduce the borrowing costs for
Canadian issuers.
The Province of Ontario has not participated so far in the recent rush for
Canadian dollar Eurobonds, mainly because it has fulfilled its fiscal
1992-1993 funding programme of CDollars 10.9bn with a USDollars 3bn 10-year
offering in January.
KommuneKredit of Denmark has signed a USDollars 1bn Euro medium term note
programme. Lehman Brothers International and Lehman Brothers Bankhaus acted
as arrangers and the notes will be rated Aa1 by Moody's Investors Service.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Risk and Reward: ERM fear factor holds key to cost of
currency options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of hedging foreign currency positions or cashflows through the
options market fell last week as pressure eased again in the European
exchange rate mechanism.
By historic standards, though, the market's expectations of future currency
volatility remain high, reflecting a nagging fear that it could take several
more spins of the ERM roulette wheel before the currency system's future is
settled.
By the end of last week, implied volatility levels across most currencies -
the measure of uncertainty about future price movements, and the biggest
influence on the cost of options - had fallen markedly.
In the USDollars /D-Mark market, the most liquid of the currency option
markets, three-month implied volatility fell during the week from around 14
per cent to just under 13 per cent. Options on the D-Mark/FFr rate also fell
 -although this market remains very thinly traded with wide spreads between
bid and offer prices. At around 5 per cent by the end of the week, the
one-month volatility level still remained well above the fluctuation level
allowed for in the ERM narrow band, pointing to the continuing unease about
the French franc before next month's elections.
Sterling volatility, which had lurched upwards the previous week on an
unexpected interest rate cut, also eased. Three-month sterling/D-Mark
volatility ended on Friday at 13.5 per cent, down sharply from the 16.5 per
cent at which it had started the week.
All of this points to greater confidence about current exchange rate levels.
As Mr Mike Hargrove, Citibank's chief currency options dealer in London,
commented: 'There is a much lower level of overall fear. At the moment, we
think options represent reasonably good value.'
It remains the case, though, that volatility levels in certain currencies
are historically high. One-month Pounds /Dollars volatility, for instance,
is roughly in the middle of its trading range of the past three months or
so, having come down from the peaks reached when the currency was bounced
out of the ERM in September. It has not returned to pre-September levels,
although Pounds /DM has followed an almost identical pattern.
The cost of hedging cross-rates in Europe also remains high, discouraging
investors from buying options. That, in turn, has kept many investors out of
the European cash bond markets - despite a generally positive view about the
prospects for the 'core' bond markets  - and led to a continuing focus on
'basis trading' between futures contracts to take a position.
For instance Lazard Investors, the fund management arm of the UK merchant
bank, said it has sold what it calls 'substantial' holdings in the cash
French government bond market and bought futures instead.
If ERM tension continues to ease, then a growing number of investors are
likely to be tempted back into cash markets in the coming months. In France,
for instance, the Pibor (short-term interest rate) futures contract had
climbed to 89.25 by the end of the week, up a full point on seven days
before, implying interest rates of 10.75 per cent. The cost of options on
the contract fell sharply.
The greater certainty of falling French money market rates that this
suggests could signal a sharp convergence between German and French bond
yields to come.
What price currency protection at such times? The trouble is, should the
fear factor return to the ERM, the cost of currency options will bounce back
at levels which make today's look meagre by comparison.

Vaux Group's Swallow hotels continued to suffer in the recession and trading
profits were falling short of the interest costs on some recent investments,
the annual meeting was told.
Hotel occupancies in the October-January period were 5 per cent higher than
a year ago but achieved room rates were 5 per cent down.
However, the group's breweries were performing well.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOTEX, the retail group which is Hungary's largest public company, lifted
turnover last year by 40 per cent to Ft9bn (Dollars 106m).
The full consolidation of Kontur, a department store chain in western
Hungary, a doubling of turnover at Azurinvest, the wholesaling subsidiary,
and growing returns from the distribution of Gillette razors, contributed to
the improvement.
Fotex expects that last year's purchases of Ofotert, a photo-developer, and
Domus, a furniture retailer, will add another Ft5bn to turnover for the
current year.
Fotex has expanded largely through bids for companies set for privatisation.
However, executives expect a pause in its acquisition strategy in the first
part of the year to allow time to digest and implement new management
systems.
The acquisitions, while boosting turnover, hit profitability. Fotex drew
down the cash raised through a Dollars 54m share offering in the US during
1991 and interest income fell, pushed down by plummeting deposit rates.
The fall in interest income was largely offset by improving operating
results. Profits after tax came to an estimated Ft1bn in 1992 compared with
Ft1.05bn a year earlier.

FT  08 FEB 93 / International Company News: Banco Santander aims to earn
half its profits abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EMILIO BOTIN, chairman of Banco Santander, has announced that the Spanish
bank plans to step up its strategy of international expansion, with the aim
of increasing net profits earned abroad to 50 per cent of the group's total.
Mr Botin told the bank's annual meeting at the weekend that international
business contributed Dollars 205m to consolidated net profits of Dollars
577.1m in 1992. 'The time will come when half our assets and profits will be
abroad,' Mr Botin said. 'That is our objective and that is where we are
going.'
As part of this strategy Santander was considering exercising warrants in
First Fidelity Bancorporation which would increase its shareholding in the
New Jersey bank from 16.5 per cent to 23 per cent.
An equity stake of more than 20 per cent would mean the consolidation of
First Fidelity's results with Santander's and boost the Spanish group's
already strong balance sheet.
Mr Botin said that despite a very difficult year Santander had achieved a
'satisfactory' growth of 12.5 per cent in operating profits. This was due
more to a growth in fee income, which rose 21.8 per cent to Dollars 602m,
and control over operating expenses, than to higher margins.
Santander's total dividend was increased by 8.33 per cent, year on year, to
Pta260 (Dollars 2.24) a share. The Spanish government has created four
limited companies called Sociedad Estatal de Patrimonio I, II, III and IV,
in a move that prepares the ground for big disposals of state-owned
shareholdings.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, economy minister, said up to 25 per cent of Argentaria,
the banking group, would be placed on the market 'immediately'.

FT  08 FEB 93 / International Company News: Endesa will issue bonds to
finance acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
ENDESA, Chile's biggest electricity company, hopes to place more than
Dollars 50m of long-term bonds on the international markets this year to
finance acquisitions in Argentina and Peru, according to the company's
financial managers.
Endesa sees the privatisation of utilities in neighbouring countries as an
opportunity to become Latin America's first multinational company in the
energy sector.
The process began last year, when Endesa acquired a controlling stake in
Argentina's Central Costanera, a power generator, and a minority
shareholding in Edesur, an electricity distribution company. The Dollars
100m investment was financed in part with an Dollars 85m syndicated credit
led by Credit Suisse First Boston.
Mr Rodrigo Danus, chief of Endesa's financial division, says the company is
preparing to bid for Hidronor, a group of five power plants in southern
Argentina which will be privatised in the first half of 1993. Company
executives have also travelled to Peru to study the planned state sell-offs
of Electro Lima and Electro Peru.
Endesa, which generates over half of Chile's electricity, posted profits of
Dollars 260m last year, a 30.2 per cent increase over 1991. The results were
'the best in the company's history,' according to Mr Jose Yuraszeck,
chairman.
It recently became the first private sector corporation in Latin America to
win an 'investment grade' rating from Standard &amp; Poor's, the US ratings
agency.
At home, Endesa has begun work on a Dollars 450m hydroelectric dam in Chile,
partly financed by the World Bank's International Finance Corporation.
Environmental groups oppose the dam's construction on the grounds that it
will destroy wildlife and affect Indian communities in the reaches of the
Bio Bio, Chile's longest river.
In Argentina, Mr Yuraszeck said Endesa had increased electricity production
at Central Costanera nine-fold since it took over the plant last May.

FT  08 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Life groups in Japan to gain losses
concession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ministry of finance is likely to allow life insurance companies to
postpone booking foreign exchange losses on international bond investments
for the year ending March 1993.
The move is part of the ministry's efforts to support the ailing Tokyo stock
market by restricting stock sales by institutional investors. The ministry
has already instructed the country's banks not to sell stocks to shore up
profits, and now wants to prevent selling by life groups, Japan's leading
institutional investors, to cover for their investments in Australian and
Canadian bonds.
Although life assurers are allowed to value foreign securities at book
value, they are required to book losses once the market value of the
investments falls more than 15 per cent. Both Canadian and Australian
dollars have fallen sharply against the yen this fiscal year, and leading
life assurers are believed to be holding some Y300bn (Dollars 2.41bn) in
unrealised losses.
The ministry is also considering whether to allow life assurers to book
unrealised profits on stock holdings to prop up profits. While the move is
likely to attract criticism as window dressing of accounts, the finance
ministry intends to allow life assurers to include unrealised stock profits
to increase their dividend reserves for policy holders.
Unrealised profits on stock holdings have served to cover the loss between
dividends on policies, which average around 6.5 per cent, and the return on
the assurers' investments, which is declining rapidly due to the fall in
interest rates.
The ministry and life industry are becoming wary over further erosion of the
'buffer' against lower returns through realising latent gains on stocks.
Combined unrealised profits on stocks at the largest life assurers totalled
some Y6,000bn last September, Y2,000bn lower than the previous year.

FT  08 FEB 93 / International Company News: Dofasco takes CDollars 202m
charge for restructuring

<TEXT>
DOFASCO, one of Canada's two biggest steel makers, has taken a CDollars 202m
(USDollars 159m) special charge to cover restructuring costs over the next
18 months and has reported a heavy loss for 1992.
The charge will cover the shutdown of 3m tonnes of older capacity this
summer at Hamilton, near Toronto. Dofasco's payroll will be reduced from
8,700 to 6,400 by early 1994 and its raw steel capacity will drop to 3m
tonnes produced at its most modern and efficient plant.
The company is also moving ahead with detailed planning for a joint venture
mini-mill project, to be located in Canada or the US. Its partner has been
widely reported as Co-Steel, a mini-mill specialist which controls Sheerness
Steel in Britain. But Dofasco has resolutely refused to identify the
partner.
Final net losses came to CDollars 207m, or CDollars 2.96 a share, for 1992,
against losses of CDollars 25m, or 73 cents, a year earlier. Turnover
slipped to CDollars 1.95bn from CDollars 2.1bn.
Dofasco said prices have begun to improve, costs would decline further in
1993 and a lower Canadian dollar is helping recovery.

ROUSSEL-Uclaf, one of France's largest chemicals companies, has bucked the
slump in the French corporate sector by increasing net profits by 72 per
cent to FFr1.02bn (Dollars 182m) in 1992.
The group, which is 54 per cent owned by Hoechst, the German chemicals
group, said that most areas of activity had shown growth in 1992 with some
sectors performing ahead of target. The only exception was arable farming
products which suffered from the economic slowdown in Europe and the
European community's agricultural reforms.
Roussel's overall sales rose by 3.2 per cent to FFr14.8bn. Net profits,
excluding exceptional items, showed growth of 11.9 per cent to FFr735m last
year. The group's underlying performance benefited from the strengthening of
the US dollar.
Roussel, chaired by Dr Edouard Sakziz, is in the throes of a large-scale
rationalisation programme across its European operations. This
reorganisation, which will continue until 1995 and has been highly
controversial in France, involves the closure of eight out of Roussel's 10
European factories and the loss of 800 jobs.
Last year the rationalisation cost the company FFr370m.

UK LAND, a loss-making property company with negative shareholders' funds,
on Friday responded to a sharp rise in its share price by warning that it

Its share price rose 4p to 30p, compared with a low of 7p in November.
The company issued a statement to the stock exchange, which reminded
shareholders that there was a deficit of shareholders' funds on March 31
1992 of Pounds 31.9m. 'Subsequently UK Land has been engaged in extensive
negotiations with its bankers with a view to implementing a capital
reorganisation. An announcement will be made upon the conclusion of these
negotiations,' it said.
It made a loss of Pounds 17.1m for the 18-months to March 31 after an

programmes.
In August 1991, it put two subsidiaries into liquidation.

<TEXT>
STIFFENING competition in Canada's telephone market has led Bell Canada, the
country's biggest phone company, to apply for the first rise in basic local
rates for 10 years, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
Bell, which has a monopoly on local services in the key markets of Ontario
and Quebec, said the increase is required to make up for a gradual erosion
of income from long-distance services.
The proposed increase would average 10 per cent for households and 9 per
cent for business customers. It must still be approved by a federal
regulatory agency.
Bell's lucrative long-distance business provided a CDollars 1.9bn (USDollars
1.49bn) subsidy to local services last year. According to Bell, the fee for
residential services currently averages CDollars 10 a month, compared with a
cost to the company of CDollars 40. The fee covers an unlimited number of
local calls.

FT  08 FEB 93 / Economics Notebook: Frankfurt gives London a run for its
money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At a time when Europe's monetary arrangements are a by-word for disorder,
the policies of the Bundesbank and the Bank of England appear to be
converging.
The least publicised aspect of the Bundesbank's measures last Thursday may
turn out to be the most important: the decision to create an asset-based
money market in Germany, akin to that in London but without the anachronism
of discount houses.
The German move came barely two weeks after the UK government announced that
Mr Eddie George would be Bank of England governor from July 1 and that the
Bank's 'central responsibility' in future would be - like that of the
Bundesbank - to achieve price stability.
But it would be wrong to suppose that such convergence will result in
harmony or add to stability.
The Bundesbank's money market reforms are part of a determined campaign by
the German monetary authorities to challenge the City as Europe's premier
financial centre and ensure that European economic and monetary union, if it
should ever come to pass, will carry a 'made in Germany' stamp.
Last week's Bundesbank decision to offer through tender DM25bn worth of
three, six and nine-month bills to banks, non-banks and foreign institutions
has several goals.
It gives the Bundesbank an extra weapon to mop up speculative currency
inflows by enabling it to offer such paper to non-banks for the first time.
It will also give it a better chance of controlling M3, its wayward money
supply measure.
More important, it fills an important gap in the range of German money
market instruments and so will broaden the appeal of Frankfurt to foreign
institutions.
The Bundesbank's announcement that minimum reserve requirements on banks'
time and savings deposits would be more than halved to 2 per cent of
liabilities removes a big competitive disadvantage for banks in Frankfurt
and other German centres vis-a-vis London and Luxembourg. It should
encourage the repatriation of short-term D-Mark deposits from the
Euromarket.
At the same time, the Bundesbank is pressing ahead with efforts to ensure
that an eventual Europe-wide monetary policy is modelled on continental
rather than UK practices. As Economics Notebook reported five weeks ago,
that would entail Europe-wide money supply targets as part of a stringent
counter-inflationary policy and tough approach to lender of last resort
responsibilities.
The dramatic cut in the minimum reserve rates does not mean that the
Bundesbank is abandoning this instrument of monetary control.
The minimum reserve system, often criticised abroad as a tax on banks, is
less onerous than it appears because German banks are able to obtain funds
from the central bank at less than money market rates through the
Bundesbank's discount facility. But by forcing the banks to use the discount
window, it gives the Bundesbank a valuable insight into their operations.
For that reason, Germany wants to have Europe-wide minimum reserve
requirements if and when a European central bank system begins operating in
the proposed third stage of Emu.
With the European Monetary System in turmoil, nobody can be sure that Emu
will go ahead as planned. But by taking a leaf out of the Bank of England's
book and actively promoting its own financial centres, the Bundesbank is
doing its best to ensure that, with or without Emu, Frankfurt gives London a
run for its money.
But the strategy is not without risk. From a German viewpoint, the Bank of
England is a worrying model to follow. A conglomerate among central banks,
its interests range from the newly ordained primary goal of helping to
achieve price stability, through oversight of Britain's banks and important
financial markets in London, to the broader objectives of supporting the
City and UK industry.
Like many conglomerates, the Bank has at times had difficulty reconciling
differing claims on its management resources and so ended up doing some
things badly. The supervision failures in the BCCI affair were a case in
point.
That the Bundesbank should give added importance to promoting Finanzplatz
Deutschland opens the question whether it will risk conflict with its
overriding commitment to price stability in Germany. Such doubts have been
fuelled by the circumstances of last week's interest rate reductions.
The Bundesbank would like its quarter point reduction in discount rate and
half point cut in lombard rate to 8 and 9 per cent respectively to be seen
in the context of its financial market liberalisation.
But the general perception is that the Bundesbank succumbed to political
pressure to cut rates to preserve the European exchange rate mechanism which
was facing possible terminal collapse because of a flight of funds from the
Danish krone.
The rate cuts came only days after Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank
president, indicated that lower borrowing costs were not justified because
of inflationary pressures in Germany. They have cast doubt on the
Bundesbank's counter-inflationary credibility and the D-Mark as the anchor
of the ERM.
Ironically, the Bundesbank may have undermined one of the cornerstones of
Emu by acting to defuse tension in the ERM. For if the Bundesbank cannot be
trusted to maintain its independence and commitment to price stability, how
can the same be expected of an untried European central bank if ever the EC
moves to a single currency and monetary policy?
To sow new doubts over the future of Emu may well fit in with the secret
wishes of Mr Schlesinger and his colleagues on the Bundesbank's
decision-making council.
But the cost has been that Bundesbank policies now seem almost as
incalculable as those of Mr Norman Lamont and the UK Treasury: a convergence
that can appeal to no-one in Frankfurt.
