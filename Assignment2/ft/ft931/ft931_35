NOTHING BUT BLUE SKIES
by Thomas McGuane
Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 16.99, 349 pages
THE MAN WHO WAS LATE
by Louis Begley
Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 201 pages
BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA
by Dorothy Allison
Flamingo Pounds 5.99, 309 pages
THE LONG NIGHT OF THE WHITE CHICKENS
by Francisco Goldman
Faber Pounds 14.99, 450 pages
OLD hippies don't die, they just fade into Thomas McGuane novels. His tenth,
Nothing But Blue Skies, features Frank Copenhaver, a wealthy Montana
businessman who has lopped off his pony tail and padlocked the medicine
cabinet in order to become seriously rich. His flirtation with manna ends
just after his 44th birthday, however, when his wife Gracie leaves him for a
New Age anthropologist. Frank becomes comprehensively and hilariously
unhinged, squandering his assets, embarking on bizarre erotic dalliances
and, ultimately, landing himself in court. It takes his daughter's affair
with a right-wing politician to bring Frank back to his senses.
McGuane has never written more precisely or more hilariously about that
generation which graduated from listening to Jefferson Airplane to checking
up on the Dow Jones average. Frank is a fitting hero for the times, steeped
in nostalgia for a better age yet wise enough to realise that the present
day is all he has got. Although the book flirts with high-mindedness - such
as the message that if you rape the land she will eventually press charges -
McGuane keeps things moving along with a series of raucous escapades, most
notably when Frank unwittingly rides a prize pig through the State Fair. The
result is a funny and apt survival guide for every lapsed hippy who feels
bad about selling out but does not quite know what to do about it.
Spiritual dislocation of a very different sort is on offer in The Man Who
Was Late. Its author, Louis Begley, could justifiably be called the novelist
who was late - after a distinguished career as a New York attorney, Begley
made his literary debut last year with his award winning Wartime Lies, a
tale of a young boy's escape from the Holocaust. His second novel covers
similar themes. This time, the hero is Ben, the son of Jewish refugees who,
fleeing a traumatic if unspecified past in Hitler's Europe, reinvents
himself as a suave international financier. The toll this spiritual
sleight-of-hand exacts on his heart and soul is great, most tellingly on his
relationships with women.
Begley is a novelist of extraordinary sophistication and sensitivity, with
ambitions that seem to bypass much recent writing and head straight for
Proust territory. His Ben is a scarily precious creature, a man who has
enveloped a troubled soul with epicureanism and eroticism, thereby refining
himself to the point of non-existence. Indeed, some readers might find
themselves a bit worn by Begley's occasionally cloying irony and detail.
This said, his novel remains a compelling examination of the dangers of
denying a damaged self.
Childhood scars are examined in a more forthright manner in Dorothy
Allison's Bastard Out of Carolina. The bastard in question is Ruth Anne
'Bone' Boatwright, a young member of an extended South Carolina family who
could be classified as either salt of the earth or white trash. Despite
being raised fatherless in grinding poverty, Bone's 1950s childhood is not
without its moments of happiness and security. But then her mother marries
the malevolent Daddy Glen, a darkly jealous creature who breaks Bone's bones
and molests her, even as his wife is in labour. Bone's lonely battle against
this man and the brutal patriarchy he represents are the meat of this
powerful first novel
Although Allison covers oft-ploughed territory here, she writes with
sufficient passion to make this an engaging read. Her portrait of rural
poverty is convincing and not without its humor, embodied particularly in
Bone's hard-drinking, hell-raising uncles. But the book's real strength lies
in Bone's voice, so believably rendered that the reader is willing to
accompany its speaker even through the darkest parts of her journey to
womanhood.
Another victimised woman is the focus of Francisco Goldman's first novel,
The Long Night of White Chickens. It tells the story of Flor de Mayo, a
Guatemalan girl who is plucked from an orphanage to serve as a maid for a
Boston family. They adopt her as one of their own, especially sickly young
Roger, who loves her as a sister and perhaps more. After graduating from an
elite American college, she returns to her native country to run an
orphanage, only to be murdered in mysterious circumstances. Roger's attempt
to find the truth behind her death forms the novel's central narrative.
Goldman writes with authority about modern Guatemalan politics and culture,
displaying a keen nose for the dark absurdity of Latin America, where the
powers that be refuse to investigate murders yet are all too happy to change
without notice the directions of all the country's one-way streets.
Unfortunately, Goldman's narrative is too pocked with digressions to pull
the reader along, making the novel far more effective as a rumination on
failed love than as a murder mystery.

Gilbert &amp; George are all about

<TEXT>
THE Cosmological Pictures, a series of 25 works made by Gilbert and George
in 1989, are finally installed at the Tate Liverpool after a tour of 10
European countries including Poland and Hungary. They arrived at the Albert
Dock just as a show of the artists' newest works, the New Democratic
Pictures, was coming to a close at Anthony D'Offay in London.
For their admirers, then, the past few months and those to come provide a
welcome chance to catch up with the latest works of these remarkable
artists. For their detractors, this feast is an indigestible reminder of
just how celebrated they are abroad, while continuing to arouse controversy
at home.
The London show was criticised by many and for many reasons - the artists'
nudity, a feature of many of the works, was declared to be embarrassing,
that of their young male models exploitative, their subject matter at the
same time both shocking and stale. Let us examine the case.
Gilbert and George's work deals with themselves. They are both its subject
and its content, appearing in almost all of the highly coloured, large scale
photopieces which have been their established style for over a decade. In
the mid-1970s, when the photopiece form was first being developed, they were
their only subjects. They recorded their activities (heavy drinking, mostly)
or, alone in their empty house, their feelings and moods. Then, gradually
their eyes moved outwards. Street scenes and passers-by began to appear, the
locations around their home in Spitalfields. The streets are grimy and
litter strewn, the people who walk them poor and seeming sad, the towers of
the City rearing over them, close by but detached. The walls speak. Graffiti
gives the works their titles: 'Are you angry or are you boring' or
'Communism', for example, as well as, and tellingly, 'Bent, 'Queer,' or
'Prostitute Poof'.
For Gilbert and George are homosexual, familiar with that public fear of
'otherness' the hostile scribblers express. But they are fearless. In their
early days in Spitalfields, living in the basement of the house they now
own, they tell of stones flying through the window, of being chased down the
street, running for shelter in their 'responsibility suits', the fabled
matching three button suits they have worn since the days when they first
declared their mission in life. Law 2 of 'The Laws of the Sculptors',
written in 1969, states 'Make the world believe in you and pay heavily for
this privilege.'
This dedication to their art goes along with a declared aim of making it as
clear and understandable as possible. Thus they have forged a style like no
one else's, a style which blends their own intense preoccupations -
themselves, their immediate surroundings, the bodies of beautiful young men
 -with a few props - jewel-like colour, the use of flowers, trees and
statuary - into an emblematic language of rare power. The Cosmological
Pictures show the same canny knack of summing up the state of our current
everyday world while evoking the artists' place both as part of and
commentators on it. 'Edger' shows a young man in profile and full face
superimposed over a busy city street. While he is perfectly ordinary,
tough-looking in his T shirt and jeans, his placing in the composition and
its title make us think about him again, about his place in the world, as
marginal, as threatened, perhaps, as well as threatening.
Works such as 'My World' or 'All' showing young men in compositions with
flowers, make very clear the nature of the artists' sexual feelings while
presenting them in a symbolic and romantic way. 'Blood Heads' and 'Down to
Earth' make clear too some of the dangerous consequences of the fulfilment
of desire, while 'Big Hole' with its central image of a flowering tree,
offers if not hope then perhaps consolation.
None of these is perhaps quite as powerful as a key piece of 1982, 'Life
Without End', an astonishing presentation of an ideal world of beauty and
order which does not exist but for which we all long. That it is evoked via
the persons of two men in neat suits and an array of beautiful boys should
not necessarily shock. Caravaggio's models were rent boys, after all, and an
artist's repetition of a favourite subject is not usually a cause for
complaint. No one questions the transcendence of Matisse's endless interiors
or Picasso's tortured nudes. Artists, by their obsessive grappling with a
chosen subject, make it matter for us, too, make it universal. By showing us
their world, their strange self-defined and intense universe, Gilbert and
George show us something of ourselves.
In September, their work will be seen in Beijing. What, I asked, did the
Chinese make of it? For the Chinese, they told me, their work is about being
an individual, discovering what an individual is. This response Gilbert and
George find both satisfying and exciting. 'To enter that debate is vital
while we are still alive.' Indeed it is, and for us all.

ONE OF THE FAMILY
by Wendy W Fairey
W W Norton Pounds 15.95, 288 pages
WENDY FAIREY'S mother was Sheilah Graham. Fairey was certain of that. Most
people who know anything about F. Scott Fitzgerald know something about
Sheilah Graham and her 'College of One'. She was the East End girl who moved
from a Jewish orphanage to become a Hollywood gossip columnist and then
Fitzgerald's love at the grim end of his days.
Between drinking and writing not-so-good stories to pay for his mad wife
Zelda's hospital, he discovered the fun of playing Henry Higgins to a
glamorous but ill-educated young woman. The result, according to Sheilah who
wrote a bestselling book about it, was that she inspired Fitzgerald to
produce at least a part of that brilliant novel, The Last Tycoon.
All this may seem a long build-up to Wendy Fairey's search for her identity,
but the ghost of Fitzgerald hung over her childhood as the father she had
never quite had. As it turned out, the father she thought she had was not
her actual natural father, and when she discovered his existence after her
mother died she was very pleased to acknowledge him - but he too had died,
and had done her no favours in life.
To come out with a few names, Fairey's undistinguished first
father-in-name-only was an Englishman called Trevor Westbrook who, as it
turned out, Graham had married as a cover for the birth of her daughter -
whose actual father was the philosopher Freddie Ayer. He and her mother's
other lovers at that period were, so Fairey works out for herself, Scott
substitutes. Thus the great man inspired her birth.
The thriller element is somewhat reduced by giving us Ayer at the beginning
of the book. In fact more than half of it is about her mother, set in the
lavish world of Hollywood in the 1950s as seen through the eyes of a clever,
swottish girl. With ironic hindsight, Fairey describes a child out of place
in her environment, who goes East as soon as possible and ends up, just like
the father she did not know at the time, a professor.
The quest to put together the pieces of the family jigsaw is told with great
intensity, an endearing honesty, but not much humour. Ayer, it turns out,
had always known about her. Perhaps unsurprisingly, when she eventually
meets him as her father, not just as a family friend, the professor,
although good-natured about it, cannot quite rise to her expectations.
Three months after this meeting, Ayer died and Fairey received the first
public acknowledgement of her new parentage in The Times' list of those
attending his funeral: 'Prof. Wendy Ayer'. That is a moment of blackish
humour.

LOUIS XVI
by John Hardman
Yale Pounds 19.95, 264 pages
GUILLOTINED two hundred years ago on January 21 1793, Louis XVI remains the
most elusive of monarchs. His piety, his silences, the disappearance of many
of his papers, are so many barriers to understanding. Revolutionary
propaganda and the royalist cult of the Martyr King have further distorted
the truth.
Paradoxically, Louis XVI was at first a success. When he was only 20, in
1774, he inherited a weak and discredited throne. Yet he restored French
finances and diplomatic prestige, defeated Britain in the War of American
Independence, and began a programme of unobtrusive but effective reforms -
including civil rights for Protestants, long before Catholics had them in
Britain. In some ways he was more modern than his immediate successors.
Beside his conscious rejection of territorial annexations in Europe, the
expansionism of the Republic and the Empire appears infantile and
counterproductive.
He was well educated and intelligent (his German and English were
excellent). His obsession with facts and figures - revealed in his famous
hunting diary - helped his grasp of finance. He was more opposed to the
violence and arrogance than to some of the aims of the revolutionaries.
According to John Hardman, in 1787 he 'virtually called the Third Estate
into existence as a political force.' Why then did he die beneath the
guillotine's blade?
One answer is his conscience. No monarch or ruler can afford to say, as he
did at his travesty of a trial, 'I declare to you that my conscience
reproaches me with nothing.' His predecessors had devoted themselves to
strengthening the royal power-base and propaganda machine. Louis XVI put le
bonheur des francais first, thereby losing the power to realise it.
Few kings, however, have faced such difficulties - and such treachery.
Beneath a show of obedience, members of his family, and some of his
ministers, pursued policies hostile to his own. Hardman shows that the Comte
de Vergennes, one of the greatest foreign ministers in the history of
France, a confidant and favourite of the King, intrigued against the King
and Queen during the Diamond Necklace Affair in order to bring witnesses
favourable to the Cardinal de Rohan back to France. The Finance Minister and
popular idol Necker sabotaged the Seance Royale of July 17 1789. The Right
in the National Assembly was as ready to flout the King's will as the left.
John Hardman's biography coincides not just with the two hundredth
anniversary of the King's death but with the final realisation by much of
French opinion that it was worse than a crime, a mistake. Only 262 pages
long, this is a political history, with little on the King's piety, his
concern for the poor or his artistic patronage.
In my opinion, Hardman is not critical enough of such sources as the
denigratory diary of the Abbe de Veri or the hagiographical memoirs of Baron
Hue. Nor is he sufficiently forthright about the treachery of Marie
Antoinette towards her husband. Not all errors are minor. Far from showing
that the King continued paying those bodyguards who emigrated, the papers
from the Tuileries show that he stopped. The posthumous cult of Louis XVI is
ignored.
Nevertheless, the force of prejudice, especially about royal figures, is so
strong that this is the only sane assessment of Louis XVI in English since
his death. The bright light of Hardman's archival research dispels the fogs
of revolutionary and royalist propaganda. A different man emerges:
energetic, sardonic, rarely influenced by the Queen except perhaps in
1787-9. He could fly into 'a towering rage'; different ministers described
him as 'harsh' or 'implacable'; he had a sense of humour (he called
Catherine II Madame Potemkin), and a grasp of reality. Although he failed to
exploit it in the crucial months May-July 1789, he knew that the amour
propre of 'the bourgeoisie' (his term) was one of the main forces behind the
revolution. By July 1789 the Paris mob was uncontrollable and the royal army
unreliable. To have survived on the throne, and saved France from civil war,
for three more years, was no ordinary achievement.
On the political history of the reign Hardman is generally judicious and
interesting. By ignoring the military dimension, he fails to explain why the
King lost, or failed to use, ultima ratio regum: cannon power. This
breakdown, more than fundamental political conflict, is the real explanation
for the hiatus in monarchical power in France between 1792 and 1804.

REALMS OF GOLD: MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD
by Ann Pilling, illustrated by Kady MacDonald Denton
Kingfisher Pounds 9.99, 96 pages
IN THE recent past, collections of traditional stories have tended to be
grouped in ways that have emphasised the set-apartness of different
cultures. The long-established Oxford Myths and Legends series, for example,
takes us through Yugoslav folk tales, Chinese myths and fantasies, Irish
sagas, French legends, German hero-sagas and much else. What was required -
and what the book under review provides - was a single book that brought
some of the best stories together from all over the world so that children
could enjoy an extended exercise in ancestral cross-fertilisation.
In her introduction, the novelist Ann Pilling quotes the remark by CS Lewis,
one of our great modern myth-makers, in which he tried to explain why it is
that myths and traditional stories have an enduring hold over us. Myth, he
said, is perhaps 'an unfocused gleam of human imagination falling on divine
truth'.
A more secular reading of that remark would make references to wisdom,
poetry and human value systems that are held in common. In this book, for
example, we find Midas, who must for ever re-learn his lesson about the
greed for gold; Perseus, perpetually in thrall to the spirit of adventure;
the two giants, one Scots, the other Irish, who, though mighty in arms, are
dolts in the extreme; and the Norse god Balder, who must learn a painful
truth about the relationship between love and death.
Then there are the stories that were told and re-told in response to
questions about the mystery of the natural world. Who put the moon and the
stars in the sky and why? What is the origin of fire? These are as much
questions asked of the imagination as of the reasoning mind. No matter what
factual glosses may be put upon them, the answers given in story or fable
are just as likely to provide us with equal amounts of heat or light.
The book is divided into three sections: 'Earth, Air, Fire and Water', which
deals with elemental mysteries and takes in tales from Africa, North America
and the Pacific (the best of these is a Nigerian myth, Water, Moon and Sun,
which describes how the moon and the sun, once happily married, came to
suffer estrangement); 'Love and Death', which includes the touching Welsh
legend, Bedd Gelert, about the terrible fate suffered by a faithful dog who
is killed by his own master for protecting his baby from the wolf; and
'Fools and Heroes'. The Wishing Fish, a Russian tale in this last section,
has surfaced in many different forms in the past. When Rumer Godden retold
it as The Old Woman Who Lived in the Vinegar Bottle in 1972, for example,
she gave it an Irish setting.
Some of these tales, it seems, are as doughty, fearless and quite as full of
wanderlust as the questing salmon.

FREYA STARK: A BIOGRAPHY
by Molly Izzard
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 25, 342 pages
ONE OF the curious things about Freya Stark's travel books is that she is
always falling ill. It comes as a bit of a shock to the armchair reader to
realise that this famous maiden lady voyaging to the remoter corners of
Arabia was a hypochondriac: we begin to wonder why. But she cannot have been
as frail as all that. Tomorrow, in her home in Asolo, she arrives at her one
hundredth birthday. Perhaps it is just as well that the old girl is in no
mental state to be aware of this new biography.
Molly Izzard, who is herself a long-time Middle East hand, has decided that
it is time to de-bunk - to de-mythologise - Dame Freya's carefully presented
life story. To do this she has placed herself, as biographer, at front of
stage, and described her long and fascinating investigation into the truth
behind the legendary image of the Great Traveller. Her exploration of a
personality, as she puts it, takes her into territory which Dame Freya (in
her voluminous memoirs and published letters) and her faithful friends have
always been careful to avoid.
The first 35 years, for example, have had only the sketchiest of maps. Now
we can see the semi-invalid daughter of an unhappy middle-class marriage,
traumatised and scarred by a head wound and jilted by her Italian fiance,
taking Arabic lessons with the vague idea of becoming a governess in the
Middle East. Once into Lebanon with a wealthy woman friend in 1928, Freya
discovered her vocation.
But hold on, says Mrs Izzard - she was never a serious explorer: her pre-war
travels were very modest and brief affairs, as the local colonial officers
always knew, though they were willing to help her and rescue her when she
fell sick. Her true gift lay in her writing - 'the deft concealment of the
practical under the poetic' as the biographer describes it - in which she
re-worked the material first drafted in the thousands of letters she used
instead of a journal. Dame Freya, it is correctly insisted, is not worthy of
the frequent comparison with Gertrude Bell.
That is also true of her wartime activities when she was posted to Cairo and
Baghdad to organise her 'Brotherhood of Freedom', the Ikhwan al Hurriyah, a
clandestine network of pro-British locals whose importance is hard to assess
in these post-Nasser days - a sort of 'Greenmantle in reverse' is Izzard's
witty comment (Buchan's version was the Ka'aba al Hurriyah). What is clear
is that by the end of the war Freya Stark was a celebrity, her reputation as
a Middle East expert established, but by no means justified with hindsight.
By this time, and after the necessary passage on Freya's late and absurd
marriage to her homosexual colleague Stewart Perowne, Mrs Izzard loses
interest. There is next to nothing in this book about the past 40 years of
Dame Freya's life, and rather too much on the newly discovered family
background. There is also too much speculation about motivation.
We are to understand that Dame Freya was in reality an egotistic
self-publicist, naive, exploitative and spiteful to old friends, a
psychosomatic fantasist who used her symptoms to attract attention, an
Edwardian imperialist who never had any sense of Arab nationalism. 'Her
preferred associates were wealthy, with important connections or influential
family backgrounds, preferably rather grand. She had little time for the
humble and the obscure except as ministrants to her own comfort and needs,
on whom her bland affability and easy manner usually produced a gratified
willingness to be made use of . . .'
This last does at least suggest that she had charm, as her friends would
certainly agree. Whether she was in love with her mother - or with her
father - and what that meant for her sexuality . . . well, by now Mrs Izzard
is out of her depth.
This book was commissioned by Dame Freya's attentive and long-suffering
publishers, John Murray, who, when they saw it, changed their mind. They had
earlier declined the eight volumes of collected letters which Dame Freya
insisted on publishing in her eighties. But it is worth going back, not just
to the 1930s travel books but also to the John Murray 1988 selection of
letters in one volume, Over the Rim of the World. There is a tone of voice
in them which this mischievous, very readable birthday present does not
adequately acknowledge.

IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE ODIOUS: DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL IN WARTIME
BRITAIN
by A W Brian Simpson
Oxford Pounds 35, 453 pages
BRITAIN's security services have always existed in a dangerous
constitutional vacuum, their wide-ranging powers untrammelled by too much
concern for public accountability. Their principal claim on our affections
has been the spawning of some good fictional thrillers.
This impressive book delves into the murky muddle which suffused the
activities of the secret services during the Second World War. In many ways
it was MI5's finest hour: government gave it its head to imprison, without
trial and often without stated accusation, thousands of British and foreign
citizens.
The most famous case, that of Sir Oswald Mosley, head of the British Union
of Fascists, is still remembered; but Brian Simpson's meticulous study
examines the blundering paranoia which led to the far worse treatment -
including physical and psychological brutality - meted out to many other,
forgotten names.
There are some grimly risible moments. In the House of Commons one MP
critical of the round-ups, Richard Stokes, drew attention to the arrest and
five month detention of a woman who had two children. When MI5 had searched
her house 'a diary was found for 1938 with the entry 'M49 Destroy British
Queen. Instal Italian Queen.' It took MI5 six weeks to find out that 'this
lady kept bees, and that this entry referred to a method of improving the
breed of bees.'' No matter; they still kept her inside for another 14 weeks.
Brian Simpson's book indicates that at times of high stress neither the
British constitution nor its legal system are sufficient to safeguard abuses
of power by secretive elements of the executive. On May 22 1940 parliament,
which had been lied to by both government and the executive as to the full
scope of the legislation, passed the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 'which
formally conferred on the executive the powers appropriate to a totalitarian
state at war.' That night the privy council passed regulation 18B (1A),
which was to be used to detain without trial not just members and former
members of the British Union but also those who had never been associated
with it. Mosley was arrested on May 23.
Regulation 18B came into existence precisely because MI5 could discover no
proof of Mosley's organisation being funded or controlled by Nazi Germany;
one of its clauses provided that it was sufficient for an organisation to be
subject to foreign 'influence', and on that basis the BU was rounded up. At
the same time, the certainly foreign-influenced and controlled Communist
Party of Great Britain, which, unlike the BU, had considerable scope for
causing industrial unrest, was left unhindered.
Mosley was a relatively easy target; his patriotic fascism had no real
toe-hold amongst the general public. But in the process of bypassing laws to
stifle an anti-democratic organisation, the furtive branch of the executive
chipped off another protective layer of British civil liberties.
Britain's security services, backed by government, have long maintained that
it would be an absurdity for their activities to be open to public scrutiny.
That stance has become increasingly untenable in the light of recent events,
not least the Matrix Churchill affair. Since 1974 Britain has operated the
Prevention of Terrorism Act, giving the Home Secretary the right to sentence
British citizens to internal exile to Ulster without the right of a trial.
We have, in essence, not moved very far from Regulation 18B.
Thus the importance of this book, beyond its historical record, is its
timeliness. Simpson, summarising just one element of his investigation,
says: 'the independent and secret character of MI5 enabled it to withold
information and evidence from the Home Office's committee, and to pressure
the Home Office into decisions whose merits the Home Office was unable to
check, and for which the Home Office was nevertheless politically
responsible.' Contemporary Britain is glued to the 1940s in quite unpleasant
ways.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Books: All bark, no bite - Mrs Gaskell deserves better,
decides Jackie Wullschlager

ELIZABETH GASKELL: A HABIT OF STORIES
by Jennie Uglow
Faber Pounds 20, 690 pages
'Oh Mrs Gaskell - Fearful - Fearful] If I were Mr G, O Heaven, how I would
beat her', wrote Charles Dickens.
BUT HOW dangerous was Mrs G? Like other women writers masked by chattel
names - Mrs Radcliffe, Mrs Humphrey Ward - she was a middle class wife who
shot out radical novels from behind the shelter of the marriage lines. Her
public image was one of charity and good deeds. Was she a seething
revolutionary or a busybody who turned the wretchedness of those she helped
into sensational fiction?
Mrs Gaskell's life was active, happy, and uneventful. Brought up in a
country town, she married at 21 a hymn-writing Unitarian minister from
Manchester whose compositions included 'Meekly Take Thy Place Assigned'. She
threw herself into motherhood and social work among Manchester's poor, and
in 1848 wrote her first novel of working class life, Mary Barton. It was
seen as a call to revolution, while a successor, Ruth, about a seamstress
left with an illegitimate child, was ritually burnt by her husband's
parishioners. Charles Kingsley heralded the first book as a Chartist tract
but found Ruth too powerful: 'I don't think I shall go on with it. I am sure
it is not going to be pleasant,' he said, after 20 pages - he had the same
response to Othello.
Today these worthy tales seem tame and genteel, but through the 1850s Mrs G
thrived on the controversy they sparked, denied political interest - 'No one
can feel more deeply than I how wicked it is to excite class against class'
 -and grew rich on royalties. She became friends with Dickens and Charlotte
Bronte, and dreamt of life away from Manchester. At 53, she purchased unseen
a large house in Hampshire as a surprise for her husband, sped around
collecting furniture, and whizzed south to see the result. Hours after
crossing the threshold, she collapsed in her daughter's arms and died.
For a biographer, the trouble with Mrs Gaskell is that her life was full of
people more interesting than she was, and that her relations with them mark
her own limited imagination. A letter to George Eliot, living openly with GH
Lewes, ends: 'I should not be quite true in my ending, if I did not say that
I wish you were Mrs Lewes.' The difference between Charlotte Bronte and
herself, she writes, 'is that she puts all her naughtiness into her books
and I put all my goodness.'
And that is the biographer's second problem: where a study of Eliot or
Bronte reveals rich seams of crises, passions and self doubts that fuelled
Middlemarch or Jane Eyre, Elizabeth Gaskell's even, beautiful life tells
unfashionably little about her work. She recognised as much in answering an
enquirer: 'I do not see why the public have any more to do with me than to
buy or reject the wares I supply to them.' She was every inch the bourgeoise
entertainer, and not at all the alienated artist.
That leaves the biographer with a socio-historical approach, and there is
much here - Mrs Gaskell's energy, morality, ambition, her domination of her
daughters - that is emblematic of the mid-Victorian age, as well as scope to
set the outlook of novels like North and South or Ruth, which finally
kow-tow to middle class respectability, against work by, say, Zola or Hardy,
which really did ask inflammatory questions.
John Sutherland, in his life of Mrs Humphrey Ward (1990) showed how the mind
of a Victorian writer could be a fascinating focus for the thoughts and
dilemmas of an age. But Miss Uglow has no insight into the Victorian world
view, and she assembles the minutiae of trivia and detail, of places
visited, meals eaten, without ever building them into a general picture.
This is biography of the 'new year of 1852 began with the usual bustle'
(page 299) genre: dull, undirected, humourless and far too long. A good
literary Life sends one back to the work; this one confirms Mrs Gaskell's
own modest opinion, that barely one of her novels bears re-reading. She
deserves a bolder and more eloquent rescue.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Travel: A wild west where dolphins play and life itself was
born - Julia Berney marvels at Shark Bay, an Australian outpost so remote
that special tax rebates compensate for the isolation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIA BERNEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WE WERE flying over Shark Bay's vivid jigsaw
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
bloody dunes, turquoise lagoons, bottle-glass sea, indigo submarine meadows.
Down there, you could fraternise with a dolphin, follow the stromatolite
road to an evolutionary time warp, and maybe spot a mermaid - in one day if
you hurried. But everyone said: 'Nobody rushes round here.'
I saw my mermaid only from the aircraft, so she looked no bigger than a
slug. She is the dugong, or sea cow, aquatic cousin of elephants. Sailors
seeing voluptuous, lactating females dreamed up mermaids. The dugong's face
must have been a let-down; but then, sailors were at sea a long time.
Below stretched prongs of tree-less land and seawater evaporation tanks.
Pilot Jeff dumped Saturday's newspapers under a bush, for the solar salt
township of Useless Loop. Then we buzzed over Dirk Hartog Island, looking
down onto circling sharks and loggerhead turtles.
Hartog, in 1616, was the first of several mariners who were not overly
impressed with Australia's westernmost point. Place names reflect their
frustration: Hopeless Reach, Useless Inlet, Disappointment Loop, Mystery
Beach. The dearth of fresh water confounded them. The log of a French
captain named Hamelin recorded 'gloomy shores' and 'miserable sterility.'
The mainland approach also looks unpromising. The coastal highway's only
focal points for hundreds of kilometres are roadhouses surrounded by bottle
trees - dead shrubs adorned with empties, the art of the litter lout
glittering like apocalyptic Christmas trees.
But turning to Peron Peninsula, which bisects Shark Bay, you suddenly wake
up to its weird beauty. Side tracks lead to mangrove lagoons where Siberian
snipe come to holiday; or to mysterious blue holes on empty beaches where
you can float Dead Sea-fashion; or to stark, treacherous viewpoints like
Eagle Bluff where I watched a manta ray fly like a carpet through clear
green water. Far out in the bay, something huge was thrashing, silently.
Nobody knew what it was. The thrill of mystery remained.
Birridas - gypsum claypans - pockmark the land, rising and falling with the
tides. They look solid but a vehicle easily breaks the crust, sinking into
ooze. Only samphire grows on the claypans; mispronunciation of the plant's
name has given birridas the evocative name 'sandfire flats.' Emus crossed
the road, and snakes; Shark Bay's 98 reptiles include the deadly king brown.
Before the little town of Denham, we crossed the 26th Parallel. This is
north-west Australia's frontier, above which special tax rebates compensate
for the isolation. Remote, yet cosy, Denham feels like a Cornish fishing
village gone tropical beside a tepid sea. It possesses a supermarket called
Tradewinds, a Silverchain Bush Nursing Post visited by the flying doctor,
and a shell museum run by a Filipino lady. A notice advertises: 'Many things
to be gazed' for 'Dollars 1 each person, great or small.' After dark,
barefoot and careless on the jetty, I trod in squid ink. In the night water
were beautiful sea snakes, bites from which can kill in 30 seconds. Samoan
girls were catching squid by the bucketful, screaming in the wind as every
one spurted its last indelible defence across the decking. I wore my black
feet all next day. A note in my room begged: 'Please use desalinated water
sparingly to conserve the subsidised supply and avoid severe penalty charges
to us.'
Even in a cosmopolitan country, Denham's mix is rich. It includes Maoris and
other Polynesians, Chinese, Mauritians, European allsorts, Aborigines - in
fact, almost every ethnic group, plus hybrids - and the racial harmony
positively glows. This was not just my outsider's rosy impression. It was
confirmed by Denham-born Rod Drummond, who labels himself happily as 'bitsa'
 -bits of this, bits of that, chiefly Aboriginal, Malay, Melanesian and
Norwegian - and thanks his mixed blood for 'letting me evaluate both sides
of an argument - see the black and white views.'
The melting pot began in the mid-19th century. European pastoralists arrived
 -sheep tolerate artesian water too salty for human consumption - and then
pearling attracted the Asians. Once, Denham had a pearl-shell road. Now, an
industry that died has been resuscitated.
From Monkey Mia, I reached the pearl farm by glass-bottomed boat. Green
turtles lumbered below; long-tom fish tailwalked the ripples like big silver
pencils. A thunderhead was dropping rain that evaporated halfway down the
sky.
Pearls are sold in a floating hut. The attraction of paying wholesale export
prices (roughly half those in jewellers' shops) seemed to be equalled by the
romance of buying pearls directly above the oyster lines. The farm
cultivates white and black pearls, but you can also buy golden and cream
pearls that develop from the yellow nacre typical of Shark Bay oysters.
Monkey Mia, named after a boat, is famed for the bottlenose dolphins which
for three decades have swum inshore - in water so shallow they almost beach
themselves - to mingle with people. This is no stage-managed show. The
dolphins are wild. Hand-feeding, which is very restricted, cannot be the
sole attraction: dolphins sometimes give the fish back. Nobody, from animal
behaviour researchers to tourists, doubts that the dolphins visit just for
human contact.
I sensed the dolphins observing me like hosts scrutinising a guest - an
unexpected role reversal. I stroked their flanks but soon stopped clicking
my fingers and making kissy noises: it seemed insulting. The dolphin smile
is fixed and meaningless, but the intelligence in the eye shocks you into
humility.
Ranger Cilla Hurley captured the intimacy of the experience: 'When a
pregnant dolphin lets me stroke her and feel the calf moving inside - that's
most special.' A day after giving birth, the mother, showing remarkable
trust, brings her baby to meet a crowd of strangers.
South lies one of only two beaches in the world composed entirely of shells.
In Lharidon Bight, a tiny bivalve multiplies unchecked because it enjoys
hyper-salinity - caused by high evaporation from shallow water - which
precludes its predators. Beach deposits accrete to form coquina limestone,
which is chain-sawed into sparkling white building blocks.
The Hamelin shell-block quarry borders the old telegraph station which,
incongruously, sells Devonshire teas. On a dune stands the bleak grave of a
baby cholera victim from 1898. The even lonelier beach grave of a drowned
man overlooks the stromatolites.
These are stony, mushroom-shaped columns built in shallow water by
microscopic cyanobacteria. More primitive than plants, yet photosynthetic,
they trap and bind sediment as they grow, painfully slowly. With its unique
combination of favourable factors - such as highly mineralised water and
restricted circulation - Hamelin Pool houses the world's only major colony
of living stromatolites.
Walking this reef is like journeying back into geological time for,
metaphorically, these stromatolites are stepping stones from the beginning
of evolution. For billions of years, cyanobacteria were pumping out oxygen
when no higher life form existed to use it up. We are still recycling that
oxygen stockpile. Stromatolites paved the way for all other life.
Shark Bay's ecosystem is balanced finely. Stromatolites; rich desert
wildlife; the world's most secure dugong population, 10,000 strong; island
refuges of marsupials extinct elsewhere, and a sea boiling with fish - all
merit protection.
Shark Bay has now received a World Heritage listing. This antagonises many
pastoralists, salt miners and commercial fishermen who, naturally, defend
their livelihood. Tourism, too, might seem to conflict with conservation
needs but Jim Matan, a regional tourism manager, told me of the 'new
sensibilities' influencing potential development. Basically, Shark Bay is
recognised as unique and precious, and anything that threatened the
environment would be self-defeating for the tourism industry.
Western Australia's department of conservation and land management is
turning Peron pastoral station into a national park. Sheep were removed
first; then, with more difficulty, foxes and feral cats - immigrants
responsible largely for Australia's marsupial losses.
At the end of the day, the juggling of interests in Shark Bay is
mind-boggling. At the end of my last day there, however, my problem was
staying awake. If I slept, I knew I would not rouse by 3am to reach the
Overlander Roadhouse for the Greyhound, which hurtles through the night like
a mobile dor mitory.
Rod Drummond knew the local cure for flagging spirits. He took me to Peron,
which has terrible beauty at sunset: the sand goes end-of-the-world red.
Here, like a missionary in the cooking pot, I had to stand shoulder-deep in
an old corrugated tank brimming with artesian water that comes up as hot as
the hottest bath, then dry off in the tingly wind.
The desert hydrotherapy worked. I never slept until the Greyhound reached
the bottle trees, a minute past the Overlander, an hour before dawn.
Denham is around 10 hours by road from Perth, or three hours by Western
Airlines. From its tourist centre, Topday Safari Tours runs adventurous 4WD
tours with guide Rod Drummond. Fishing tours and 4WD hire are available. The
Old Pearler Restaurant serves excellent seafood. Julia Berney stayed at
Denham Villas: self-contained units a stone's throw from the sea.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Travel: Carnival and caribou . . . in moderation - Kevin
Piley enjoys Quebec's winter frolics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN PILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU have never found yourself in the middle of the night standing in 2ft
of snow, chatting merrily to a 7ft snowman, you have not experienced
hypothermic delirium or the Quebec winter carnival.
The Quebec carnival is one of the world's largest. However, in terms of
audience participation and organisation it still claims third place behind
the Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans and Rio. Each February, 600,000
carnalveux (double the number of Quebec's permanent population) enjoy the
show.
It started in 1894. Since 1973 the carnival has been spread over 11 days and
is held each year from the first Thursday in February to the second Sunday.
This year's dates: February 4-14.
It takes a certain insanity to enjoy a rave in sub-zero temperatures, but
the Quebecoise attach great importance to their carnival. It is the
highlight of their bitingly cold and unequivocally wintry winter. It is also
their third-largest revenue-producing event. Rooms in hotels like the
Chateau Frontenac and Hotel des Gouverneurs are at a premium and booked
years in advance. Some families and companies have season tickets.
Just as the Soviet Union used to parade its military might in Red Square, so
the Canadians seize the chance each February to show off their enormous
stockpile of red noses, roadside slush and joie de vivre. Innumerable
bundles of teeth-chattering, feet-stomping, lurid and puce winter-wear line
the streets of the Old Quarter drinking caribou, which tastes as if it is
made from red wine plus the lubricants used in the city's snow-blowers.
Caribou is traditionally drunk out of a long plastic hollow walking-stick
topped with the face of Le Bonnehomme Carnival. It is powerful stuff and
numbs you to the acute cold and all other manifestations of the outside
world within seconds.
The festivities are centred around the Ice Palace at the Place du Palais
opposite the parliament building. It claims to be the biggest compacted snow
structure in the world, measuring 70ft high by 60ft wide, and is the
official residence of the ubiquitous Bonnehomme Carnaval, the world's first
and - so far - only full-time professional snowman.
He presides at all events, after which he embarks on a world-wide promotion
tour. He looks like the Pillsbury Doughboy after a course of growth hormone
therapy and his identity, from one year to the next, is a closely guarded
secret.
Le Bonnehomme is the official starter at the annual two-mile international
canoe race across the St Lawrence which consists of teams of five masochists
rowing and then carrying their boats across the ice floes to Levis and back
for a cash prize. There are snowmobile races and a prestigious snow
sculpture competition on the Fields of Abraham the scene of the battle
between Wolfe and Montcalm in 1759.
Quebec was founded in 1608 and in La Rue Petit-Champlain it has North
America's oldest street. The French influence is maintained and cultivated.
The best restaurants, like Restaurant Bonaparte, are found along the Grand
Allee.
Le Restaurant au Parmesan on Rue Saint-Louis is famed for its minestrone
soup and for its owner, Cesar, who will towel down your hair for you when
you arrive. He also has an interesting way of maintaining a swift turnround
of covers: he employs an accordionist.
Refresher courses in history and body heat retention are available
throughout the day at the Battlefields Park Museum which offers audio-visual
reenactments of various momentous sieges and Canadian capitulations down the
ages.
The carnival's climax is a parade consisting of floats which look like cars
covered in brightly-painted tarpaulins strung with Christmas tree lights,
which is exactly what they are. There are lots of marching bands with
smoking trombones and frost-bitten clarinettists and high-kicking baton
twirlers with goosepimples protruding through their hosiery.
Canadians refuse to let either their economy or their social life stagnate
in the depth of winter. If you are visiting Canada anyway, the carnival is
worth taking in. As is caribou - in moderation.
In London, Tourism Quebec is at Quebec House, 59 Pall Mall, SW1, tel:
071-930-8314. British Airways (tel: 0345-222111) is offering 21-day advance
purchase tickets to Quebec via Montreal for Pounds 399 until March 31.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Obituary: Grand old man of gardening - Robin Lane Fox pays
tribute to Arthur Hellyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR Hellyer, who died on Thursday afternoon, was the grand old man of
English gardening, a position which he occupied with characteristic modesty,
kindness and generosity.
His honours were of the highest: he received the MBE in 1967, and the
Victoria Medal of Horticulture from the Royal Horticutural Society. Admired
internationally for his many works of reference, he was one of the great
gardening editors in the world of magazines.
It was very much in the later stages of an already famous career that in
1959 he became gardening correspondent for the FT. He met his weekly task
without interruption. He was never a man for unpunctual copy or a week off.
He belonged to a veteran school where the standards demanded professionalism
without fuss.
His long life took its distinctive turn after early fears of fatal illness.
Born in 1902, he left Dulwich College, south-east London, aged 13 when
diagnosed as having tuberculosis. After being advised to work outdoors, his
first job was growing tomatoes on the Channel Island of Guernsey. Then he
moved to a farm on neighbouring Jersey.
The islands were linked to his family through his Uncle Ernest, who was
Jersey's state auditor (Arthur once joked to me that he might have been a
little too investigative for some of his readers on the FT). It was Ernest
who owned the Jersey garden, about an acre in area, which Arthur inherited
in 1956.
But his main home lay in Sussex, where he turned 7 1/2 acres of woodland and
derelict ground at Rowfant into an imaginative, beautifully-planted design.
One garden would have been enough for most of us but Arthur managed two,
without any hint of strain.
From the Channel Islands, he graduated to the world of journalism. In 1929,
he moved to Amateur Gardening, his natural home for the next 38 years. He
edited this great British institution from 1944-67 but still found time for
the gardens, three children, a devoted marriage, a score of important books
and fine photography, not to mention his distinguished articles for Country
Life and the FT.
Arthur's style was unmistakable: clear, informed, accessible to any plain
reader but always alert to a new technique. Then there were those golden
moments when experts were proposing something without persuading Arthur that
they knew the answer.
His wife, Grace, whom he married in 1934, was the mainstay of this generous
life, herself a botanist and the ideal sounding board for each week's
written pieces until her death in 1977. Daughter Penelope then took on this
role. With their help, he never forgot that he was writing for people who
knew so much less.
Through his own work, meanwhile, his range was universal, He and his wife
ran a fruitful market garden for several years; during the droughts of the
mid-1970s, they did a memorable 'double act' for the FT on the glut of
cucumbers and their recipes for the best cucumber soup.
Simultaneously, Arthur was writing assured historical articles with an eye
for great gardens' style, changing design and social context. He brought
dozens of lesser-known places to a wider audience, in Country Life as well
as the various RHS journals.
Journalism is said to be a catty profession, and there was ample scope for
tricks from the resident old tom cat when I was appointed in 1970 as a
completely unknown second string with the brief of writing mid-week. The
deputy editor drew the task of taking us to a London restaurant where Arthur
greeted me by saying that my recruitment was great news for gardening and
the FT's commitment to it.
He went on to ask Lord Drogheda, the FT's chairman who died in 1989, whether
he was having a good year. When his lordship began discussing quarterly
profit, Arthur said he meant a good year for the camellias following his own
recent visit to the Droghedas' garden to give his free advice.
Even Arthur had his favourites in the world which he knew universally. I
think of the hardy fuchsia Brilliant; the blue hydrangea Vicomte de Vibraye;
a viola called Wellsiana, which was kept alive exclusively through his
efforts; the mysterious white climbing rose which an old nurseryman gave him
in the 1920s, and which he sent me to run up a tree; and the freesias which
he and his wife grew with such skill and fondness. Not that he ignored the
rest of this paper. While we all read his gardening columns, he would be an
avid reader of the main business of the FT.
For 22 years, this newspaper inadvertently employed two gardening columnists
who were mad-keen followers of the market without either confessing it to
the other. Their results, no doubt, reflected their differing characters:
Arthur's, I guess, were sceptical and sensible, but I also suspect that he
liked a gamble and that some of them were as bad as mine.
Since 1921, he had supported the Gardeners' Royal Benevolent Society, where
he served on the council - one of many such public roles. His final brief
illness was spent in their care, surrounded by flowers from the dozens of
friends whom he always attracted.
A few days ago, Penelope brought him camellias and some stems of willow from
the garden, but one of this country's sharpest judging eyes had not lost the
flare which served the RHS for so long. The willow, he told her, was not up
to much; and as for the camellias, they must be Lady Clare, although they
had no label.
Penelope already has begun a nursery of her own at Rowfant, much to his
pleasure: her hope is that the garden will open to the public eventually,
preserving the style and skill which Arthur and his wife stamped on it.
The loss to his two sons and daughter is partly ours and all his FT readers
will send their sympathies. The length and breadth of his life made him the
most influential and respected writer on gardening of his time.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Fashion: Paris is still the key - The nerve centre of haute
couture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARIS IS the only city in the world where large numbers of people discuss
seriously the economics of making dresses costing upwards of Pounds 6,000.
It is still the nerve centre of haute couture and even designers from
elsewhere - Versace from Milan and Valentino from Rome - come to show their
collections twice a year. Not that they expect to see many customers there.
The show goes on for the press. The publicity helps promote the lesser
products, from perfume to purses, where the real money lies.
Genuine customers have dwindled to about 1,500 worldwide, according to
Vladimir de Kouzmine, managing director of Nina Ricci couture. 'There are
many more women who could afford it but they do not have the patience for
time consuming sittings,' he says. So it has become tempting for many
designers to use couture to develop new ideas, which can be watered down for
the commercial ready-to-wear.
But making and showing a couture collection is enormously expensive. De
Kouzmine estimates that it costs Pounds 1m a time - more than half in direct
costs, the rest in tying up staff for over two months a year.
The international financial concerns which control most of the houses are
beginning to question the wisdom of it all. The result has been some awkward
ducking and diving among designers and a division between houses who see
couture as the fount of design innovation and those who feel the customer
should call more of the tune.
Last week's sale of the Yves St Laurent group to Elf Sanofi,
state-controlled through Elf Aquitaine, followed the removal of Jean-Louis
Scherrer by his Japanese financiers from the house he founded and the
short-notice installation there of Erik Mortensen, himself ousted from
Balmain.
Balmain now has the first American in Paris, Oscar de la Renta. His first
very pretty but not outstanding collection this week was seen as good
customer relations. The brilliant Christian Lacroix, whose talents are best
suited to haute couture, has had a setback with the failure of his perfume,
C'est La Vie], launched before he was well known worldwide and the question
is how long his backer, Mr Bernard Arnault, can continue to support him.
At the heart of this is the dichotomy between old-style, labour-intensive
craft and modern commercial expediency. Many couture houses are members of
the Comite Colbert, a self-financing, 70-strong group of France's luxury
goods companies, which exists to promote and perpetuate highly skilled
artisan crafts.
Apart from fighting such modern plagues as counterfeiting, it supports
education in all the crafts on which its members depend, from workshop
apprenticeships to student management and design projects on an
international basis.
Haute couture is fighting a rearguard action and its own governing body has
reduced the minimum number of workers and outfits per collection for new
couturiers in an attempt to encourage younger designers to join the
profession. So far there are no takers, but financing a couture house in the
recession cannot be done overnight. The most likely candidates are
successful ready-to-wear designers, Thierry Mugler and Claude Montana.
Mugler's collection of one-offs is already couture by any other name while
Montana has designed couture for Lanvin.
Both have a modernist design approach and would be welcomed by the more
go-ahead houses. It is now almost two years since Yves St Laurent's partner,
Pierre Berge, made his famous remark that 'couture will be dead in a
decade', but the top names are determined not to sink without a lot of
splashing.
Chanel splashes loudest of all and, in Karl Lagerfeld, it has the world's
most bankable designer. Its head of couture, Catherine Riviere is both
impossibly elegant and warmly informal. She is also a consummate
professional who says: 'The days of being in fashion for fun are over. Now
we work hard to get new clients - subtly, not aggressively. But I believe in
promoting haute couture because there are many women who can afford and want
that unique workmanship once they understand it.'
Chanel makes concessions to modern methods. Between 200 and 300 clients
order each season (though how many outfits is not revealed) and with 90
workers their ateliers are smaller than some with fewer clients. With a
global clientele who cannot all come frequently to Paris, they can work from
fewer fittings and by building trust with the customer. They also take the
collection to New York and Los Angeles. But the handwork is never skimped.
An unembroidered dress or jacket still takes between 120 and 150 hours to
make. Prices start at about Pounds 7,000 for a day dress, with suits costing
up to Pounds 15,000, although exact prices are never quoted except to
clients.
Every house has its own subtleties and at Dior much pride is taken in the
way a perfectly fitted couture outfit compensates for any imperfection in
the client's figure. 'First we take her measurements and then fit a toile
tightly around her,' says head of couture Annick de Cizancourt, another
picture of elegance in classic Dior pale grey. 'This is built into a model
of the client's body to make the outfit on.'
The house has about 200 clients of whom 10 per cent are new each year, and
120 workers. The pace is more traditional than at Chanel - 'most clients
accept that it takes about two months to complete an outfit. We are total
perfectionists. The client is paying for the work of a seamstress who has
had at least five years' training.'
Chanel and Dior insist that, although there are close links between the
perfume and fashion sides, the fashion side - including ready-to-wear,
accessories and couture - is financially independent.
At Ricci, the view is different. De Kouzmine claims 100 clients for whom
about 300 outfits are made each season by 100 workers, who also do
ready-to-wear alterations. The approach is more old-fashioned, with clients
often being personal contacts of the staff who include a princess and a
grand duchess. In spite of slightly lower prices, he says the lack of
younger clients is a source of worry for the future. 'We should look at
money-saving alternatives,' he said, 'like smaller collections, maybe more
de luxe ready-to-wear and less couture, maybe showing only once a year as
Cardin is going to do.'
The designers, though, know where the crunch comes. In couture's heyday a
client always expected at least one consultation per season with 'her'
designer. Now it rarely happens except for special wedding dresses.
'Designers are paid to create: they're very busy,' says de Kouzmine. 'And
they know that couture is not what makes the house's living.'

FT  30 JAN 93 / How to Spend It: Simply effortless chic - Lucia van der Post
with smart bags
</HEADLINE>

   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE it is perfectly true that the itsy-bitsy handbag, the modishly
scaled-down scrap of silk or softest calf, is still very much in vogue, for
most of us they have to be regarded as a bit of fashionable fun.
For our other, more everyday lives we have different requirements from our
handbags. We need something that combines insouciant chic with a certain
sturdiness and an elastic capacity to hold the cheque-book, the credit
cards, the handkerchief, the billet-doux, the bills and the other
paraphernalia that somehow effortlessly finds its way into our handbags.
Those who are forever in search of this paragon and have yet to find it
might like to look at the range produced by Baronessa Franchetti and on sale
now at Franchetti Bond, 7 Burlington Aracade, Piccadilly, London W1 and at 5
Lion and Lamb yard, Farnham, Surrey, GU9 7 LL.
The Baroness's life in handbags began in a humble enough way - importing
other people's designs from Italy and selling them in the UK.
From there she has expanded into designing her own range and she does seem
to have the knack of producing bags that combine a certain panache with real
practicality. For the working woman there are bags that are big enough to
function as briefcases - they will take A4 size folders and documents -
which also look soft and relaxed. She uses lovely leathers - all treated and
waxed to protect from water and scratches - and uses her own Franchetti coat
of arms as a signature on all her pieces.
For summer there are some striking fabric bags - the one in navy-blue cotton
with tan leather straps, photographed opposite, is a splendid example of her
combination of practicality and chic. Prices are good - ranging from about
Pounds 35 for some of the fabric versions to Pounds 150 or so for the
all-leather.
If more serious luggage is on your agenda then it is worth knowing that for
the first time the smart German label MCM is available in this country at
Harrods. Much of the range seems to suffer from too much rather than too
little design and some of it is really awfully grand, the sort of pieces
that require porters and trolleys and hefty tips but the quality is
excellent and there are some splendidly useful designs - in particular the
tan rucksack, the Gladstone-like travelling bag, the soft weekend travelling
bag, all from the Nature range - that are beautifully made and effortlessly
chic.

FT  30 JAN 93 / How to Spend It: Quick, slick cover ups - Lucia van der Post
with tidy tartans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE only recently come to see the inestimable qualities of 'throws'. At
their best they are soft, warm, durable and beautiful. They are the
quickest, simplest and cheapest way of recovering a sofa - just throw one
over the existing fabric, and there you are, a new cover.
They can be used for concealing unexceptional or even ugly tables, for
revitalising a colour scheme and can double as shawls or rugs.
Melissa Rigby has built a business round the throw. She takes fine worsted
yarn and hand dyes it with natural vegetables dyes in small batches. She
uses traditional dyes such as indigo (blue), madder (red) and weld (gold) to
produce the rich colours shown in the photograph here.
The results are beautiful contemporary classics.
Before starting Rigby Hues, the company which produces the textiles, Melissa
rigby spent some 18 months travelling and researching those cultures which
still retain the old traditions of naturally dying cloth. Her aim now is to
go on designing and producing fine naturally dyed textiles - in the pipeline
and on sale probably in about eight months time are vivid textiles from
Hungary (traditional hand-block-printed 19th century designs), traditional
double weaves from Wales as well as embroidered textiles from Transylvania
and Bangladesh.
Meanwhile, anyone wanting the throws, which measure 72in by 54in and are
fringed, can find them at George Trowark, St Christopher's Place, London W1;
Idonia van der Bijl, 25 Museum Street, London WC1, at Pounds 130 a time.
Although Melissa Rigby's throws are very special almost every furnishing
accessory company at the moment has come up with a version of their own -
photographed here is one of a new range from Osborne &amp; Little, the company
primarily known for its fabrics and wallpapers.
In fine textured pure wool worsted the combination of small and large checks
is designed to work with the other colour ranges in the fabric collection.
Pounds 85.75 from Osborne &amp; Little, 304-308 King's Road, London, SW3 2UH.

FT  30 JAN 93 / How to Spend It: Those burning ambitions. . . - Lucia van
der Post with fireplaces which give a fresh focus to the home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST people's images of fire centre around the ancient and traditional. All
those stunning stage-sets, featured in the glossy magazines as the long,
cold nights of winter draw in, nearly all centre on Dickensian images of
olde-worlde fireplaces with surrounds that ape every period from Louis XV to
Edwardian.
Even the most technologically advanced of decorative gas coal and log fires
seem to feel they need to look old-fashioned in order to appeal.
Henry Harrison is an architect who wanted to offer his clients - and anyone
else who was interested - a different aesthetic, a contemporary alternative.
After all, a working fireplace not only offers warmth but it is a compelling
focal point that adds definition to a room.
His first venture into contemporary fire design produced the Platonic Fire -
three separate designs called Socrates, Euclid and Plato. Each features a
collection of what he calls geologs, based on geometric forms such as the
sphere, the tetrahedron and the cube, all set in equally geometric chrome
grates, complete with embers and gas controls.
But Harrison felt that the Platonic series did not answer everybody's needs.
There was a need for a fireplace design that was more acceptable to
traditionalists, that looked slightly softer, but that did not simply
imitate the log fire. He therefore came up with what he calls The Sands of
Time series - two examples of which are photographed above.
He uses black granite or slate surrounds to frame what he calls a 'mise en
scene of architectural forms evoking memories of ancient cultures'. He has
used classical references such as the Corinthian capital, the Doric column,
plaques, relics and other bits of Greek entablature to replace the
conventional logs.
They are all cast in a fireproof material from moulds designed and made by
Harrison and customers can choose any combination or arrangement that they
like.
They can also order a unique piece of sculpture if they prefer - in the same
fire-proof material. Each fireplace is effectively a one - off.
There is no need for a grate - the collection of architectural relics is
arranged on a sand bed and would look as easily at home in a traditional
surround as in one of Harrison's immaculately clean and simple ones.
For the really adventurous customer Harrison has a new idea, - it just needs
somebody with courage and vision to order it and the range will be on
stream.
It is based on using perspective in a Piranesi-like way and taking Piranesi
elements such as columns, podia, eroded arches, statues and crumbling
masonry and using them to create an architectural back-drop or stage-set in
the fireplace. The elements can be arranged as the customer wishes and can
be rearranged. Prices start at about Pounds 300 for the elements, excluding
the surround.
The Platonic Fire is available at about Pounds 640 plus vat, with its
complementary surrounds starting at about Pounds 1,250. The Sands Of Time
series costs around Pounds 1,000 (plus VAT) and that will include the supply
and installation in Greater London.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Motoring: A thoroughbred beast of burden - Citroen's XM SD
estate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITROEN'S XM is not quite the biggest bulk carrier among estate cars. Ford's
Scorpio, a Mercedes 200-300T or the Vauxhall Carlton beat its load floor
length, with back seat folded, by up to five inches (12.5 cm). But nothing
can match it as a weight carrier.
As a bonus, its self-levelling suspension keeps it on an even keel with a
load of garden stone or logs. Or, for that matter, a dozen cases of still
wine, six of champagne and 24 cartons of beer.
This, my bathroom scales tell me, will total 1,074 lbs (488 kg). Allowing
294 lbs (134 kg) for my wife and me, we will still be well within the 1,378
lb (626 kg) load limit - and HM Customs' guidelines - as we roll off the
ferry at Dover one day soon.
But the XM SD estate is much more than a champion weight-lifter. I doubt
that any estate car can match its ride quality. Laden heavily or running
light, it is as unruffled by bumpy roads as an ocean liner on a gentle
swell.
On motorways, it cruises like the chairman's limousine. Semi-active
suspension lets it corner fast on winding roads without leaning; automatic
transmission makes town driving relaxed and motorway tail-backs more
tolerable.
Normally, I fill the 80-litre (17.6 gallon) tank at 450/550-mile (725/885
km) intervals because, in more than 4,000 miles (6,500 km), the worst fuel
consumption has been 28.6 mpg (9.87 l/100km). At best, it was 35.4 mpg (7.98
l/100 km).
The two-pedal XM SD estate is, of course, a turbo-diesel. It is not as
economical as a five-speed manual Citroen XM SD I drove for a year; that
gave me up to 45 mpg (6.27 l/100 km) on a journey. But the automatic is a
far nicer car to drive. With only two pedals, its awkward, foot-operated
parking brake is tolerable because it is not needed for hill starting. And
apart from replacing a no better-than-average manual gearbox, the automatic
transmission makes the XM turbo-diesel feel much more refined.
Because the 2.1 litre, 12-valve, 110-horsepower diesel is small for a car of
this size, it has to work quite hard. When accelerating, the transmission
does not go into top until nearly 3,000 rpm and 50 mph (80 kmh). On slowing
down - say, for a corner - it down-shifts almost imperceptibly into third at
around 40 mph (64 kmh) and into second at 30 mph (48 kmh).
All of this makes the XM SD drive more like a petrol-engined car than a
typical diesel. The downside is that on a cross-country route with bends and
hills, the transmission spends more time in second and third than in top,
which is no help to fuel economy. But on a motorway, the high top (under
3,000 rpm at 80 mph/128 kmh) makes for relaxed and economical motoring.
The XM SD estate has such executive car goodies as power-adjusted front
seats and door mirrors, remote central locking and electric sun roof - plus
a good radio / tape with volume and station search buttons in the steering
wheel hub. With all seats filled, it still has a load space big enough to
take a folded two-seat pram and a labrador on its bean bag.
Citroens share important mechanical components with Peugeots but are still
individualistic. Although it is not at all quirky, you would never mistake
the XM estate for anything else; it drives, rides and looks like no other
car.
List price is Pounds 20,943. This includes an information read-out telling
you which door you have left half-open and what the outside temperature is -
it flashes a frost warning below 5`C - but ABS brakes are Pounds 821 extra.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Sport: Seles set for high-decibel showdown - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO GRUNT or not to grunt, that was the question for Monica Seles at last
year's Wimbledon. In the final against Steffi Graf the world champion
remained silent and lost 6-2 6-1. At the time I was convinced that her
lacklustre performance was due to the conscious effort she made to change
the habit of a tennis lifetime. Any athlete forced to operate on the
conscious level is doomed.
For the first time since that Wimbledon meeting, the two rivals for the
world No 1 ranking clash again in today's final of the ADollars 6 (Pounds
2.6m) Ford Australian Open at Flinders Park, Melbourne, worth ADollars
410,000 to the winner. Although Monica has lowered her average decibel level
in the six matches that have taken her to her third consecutive final here,
that is only because she has slaughtered the opposition.
In her quarter-final against Julie Halard, where she failed to convert three
match points and lost her first set of the tournament, she was positively
snarling as she reeled off the last six games for victory.
The grunting issue is never far away. Irritated by the constant media
questions, the disgruntled champion said at the start of the meeting: 'I
just don't want to keep talking about it. If I grunt, fine. If I don't
grunt, that's fine too.'
After her 6-1 6-2 destruction of the world No 3 Gabriela Sabatini in a
semi-final on Thursday, the champion was positively . . . well, gruntled.
'I played a good game today. I just kept concentrating and when the pressure
was on I played quite well.'
That simple understatement reveals the total belief in her own ability that
is the foundation of Monica's greatness. Make no mistake, this remarkably
unathletic teenager is already a great champion. She has reached the final
in 33 of the last 34 tournaments she has played and won 22 of them, a run
that includes six Grand Slam wins from seven consecutive finals. In her
four-year professional career she has won 242 matches and lost 28, a winning
average of 89.6 per cent, and a player on the way up usually loses more
matches than she wins.
Chris Evert can better this - just - but only if you take her entire career.
Her record is: won 1,309; lost 149; average 89.9 per cent. Graf's record is
almost as impressive. In her ten years as a professional she has won 591 of
667 matches for a winning average of 88.6 per cent.
Graf and Seles now rule women's tennis as completely as Evert and Martina
Navratilova did in the early 1980s. Their clash in this first great
Championship of 1993 should launch us on another year of intense rivalry.
Although Graf leads 6-3 in career meetings, the first three wins came as
Seles made her grand entrance on the tour in 1989 by reaching the final of
the French Open unseeded and taking a set from Graf.
The intriguing thing about today's match is that both women are improving.
Seles is serving much better than she did last year and shares the lead with
Jennifer Capriati for the fastest recorded delivery among the women in
Melbourne, an impressive 169kph. She is also volleying with enthusiasm. In
the first game of her match against Sabatini there was a two-handed drive
volley and a beautifully struck sliced backhand volley of which Navratilova
would have been proud.
Graf, too, is volleying occasionally and is thumping that forehand as well
as ever. She has also reverted to her excellent sliced backhand as her basic
shot on that wing, an admirable decision because the ball skids through fast
and low off the Rebound Ace surface. Seles will spend much time this
afternoon digging up low balls as Graf speeds about the court to find the
crosscourt angles that will expose the double-hander's lack of reach.
The outcome, therefore, is likely to depend upon the mental qualities of the
two. This is where Seles has the edge. This intelligent teenager has a mind
like a steel trap. Against Graf in the French Open final last year, after
being thwarted on four match points at 5-3 in the final set, Monica twice
had to serve to stay in the match. She never flinched, and when she sensed
Graf's resolve weakening, the jaws snapped shut.
She has been equally canny here. Asked about playing Graf in the final she
said: 'Steffi is going to serve very strongly . . . she is playing great
tennis with great tempo, very strong on both sides . . . I will just have to
go for my shots.'
In the men's final tomorrow the holder and world No 1, Jim Courier, and the
number two seed, Stefan Edberg, meet for the eighth time. Edberg has won
four of their meetings, his last victory - the US Open final of 1991 -
revealed the 25-year-old Swede at his greatest. Since then their only
meeting has been last year's Australian final, won by Courier in four sets.
At these Championships Edberg has celebrated both his 27th birthday and a
welcome return to top form - in spite of a back spasm during his fourth
round win over Amos Mansdorf that threatened to end his challenge. In 1989
and 1990 he was forced to retire from the Australian Open with injuries and
it has taken courage for him to continue. His 7-6 6-3 7-6 semi-final win
over third seeded Pete Sampras yesterday was heroic. The American led 4-0 in
the first set but Edberg, easing himself into the match, stepped up the
tempo with some devastating returns of serve and typically athletic volleys
that finally destroyed Sampras's confidence.
Courier, the top seed, was equally impressive in beating Michael Stich 7-6
6-4 6-2. Only once, at 1-2 in the first set, was the American behind. Once
he had recovered the break of serve he proved that the basic qualities of
groundstroke control can usually beat a rampant serve-volleyer on relatively
slow courts.
This 100th Grand Slam Championship of the open era has been an impressive
meeting for the one-sidedness of the later rounds in the men's event. Not
since the US Open of 1977 have all four men's quarter-finals and both
semi-finals been won in straight sets. Someone must be doing something
right.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Skiing: Danger under the sun - The risks of the slopes and
how to ski safely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE heart of the Swiss Alps this week, something stirred. Flurries of
snow followed by more substantial falls on higher slopes in the Valais
arrived to break the relentless meteorological deadlock of sun and blue
skies but not necessarily to improve treacherous pistes. The danger to life
and limb is still there, although further snowfalls may finally minimise the
dangers.
Day after day, the slopes had slowly deteriorated from superb to good to
patchy to downright dangerous as recent deaths testify. After a superlative
start to the season, skiers encountered endless sunny days or perfect piste
skiing. But without further falls and with temperatures not always cold
enough to enable resorts to top up with artificial snow, even the best
pistes on the lower slopes gradually deteriorated. The problem now is that
small amounts of fresh snow tend to cover icy moguls, making them even more
treacherous because skiers often cannot tell what lies under the fresh
covering. Much higher up, however, the new snow is sufficiently deep on most
runs to ski without breaking through to the old snow, which was in better
condition anyway because of the altitude.
Another problem is that the very qualities that make a ski resort so
challenging - steep, long, rocky descents with chutes and couloirs - tend to
make it more dangerous with inferior snow cover.
Verbier is a good example. So are other barnstorming resorts such as St
Anton, Val d'Isere, Argentiere, Zermatt and Jackson Hole. Each has steep,
rugged, rocky mountains where the terrain includes some of the world's most
exhilarating runs. Take away too much snow cover and you get areas of
treacherous, rock-strewn slopes where out-of-control intermediates,
travelling too fast for their imagined skills, can easily damage other
skiers and themselves. The problem with strong, fit, young intermediates is
that many ski as fast as experts without the same control.
In Verbier this week, the La Chaux area above Les Ruinettes has been hell's
corner as skiers came hurtling into one of the resort's busiest bottlenecks.
In normal conditions, their inadequate technique would see them through, but
on hard, icy slopes they are unusually vulnerable - and so is anyone who
happens to be in the way.
In these conditions, a red run can easily be labelled black and even the
mildest blue can be transformed into a stiff red.
Ironically, the unpleasant and sometimes dangerous state of the slopes has
highlighted the attraction of off-piste descents, so often thought of as the
pre-occupation of the hare-brained, dangerous fringe of ski-ing. In resorts
where the groomed runs are at their most dangerous, skiing off-piste with a
qualified guide can be a safer option. Guides are trained to seek out good
and safe snow conditions. The only snag is that to get to the classic
off-piste areas a skier can rarely get by with lower-intermediate skills.
Off-piste skiers must be able to negotiate breakable crust and heavy, loose
snow, and to walk up and then ski down some steepish gradients. But just as
there are easy and difficult pistes, there are usually 'beginner' areas for
off-piste debutants.
In Verbier, intermediate piste skiers can manage the gentleish ungroomed
slopes around Attelas without a guide and even the gentle descent all the
way down from the Rosa Blanche glacier, although a guide is required to help
skiers steer clear of crevasses. More expert skiers can cope with the joys
and perhaps occasional fears of skiing a myriad off-piste itineraires.
Stairway to heaven, reached by a long traverse from the top of the Jumbo
Mont-Fort cable car, is a wonderful example of rich rewards for little
effort. It involves a steep but not difficult walk to reach some wide open
and exhilarating but not terribly steep snow fields. In good conditions,
even Mont-Gele and the legendary 'back' of Mont Fort can be skied by strong,
experienced intermediates.
On the rare occasion when a group of helicopter skiers are injured or
killed, it inevitably makes headlines. Yet you have more chance of being
injured or killed in one of the scores of individual collisions or falls on
piste than in an avalanche while heli-skiing.
Year after year, single skier's deaths have gone almost unnoticed. What is
different this year is that some of the casualties have been British.
Guides cost money. Our guide this week in Verbier, Yves Rausis - with almost
20 years experience in Canada, Alaska and California and who survived a
massive 2,300 foot fall during an avalanche while guiding in Verbier eight
years ago - cost SFr400 (Pounds 183.40) a day between four of us.
You might well ask why you should pay such a sum to ski off-piste when you
are already having to pay to ski on-piste. However, your Pounds 50 will
bring you not only good snow while others are struggling in difficult
conditions, but also wonderful adventures in remote and beautiful
wildernesses that you would not find if you spent the whole week looking,
not to mention the risk of falling down a crevasse in the process.
Guides such as Rausis can make all the difference between an average day on
skis and a truly outstanding one. They instil a confidence that is rarely
misplaced. I would ski over a cliff for Yves in the almost certain knowledge
that I would not only live to tell the tale but do it all over again. Such
confidence can enable you to ski with verve in places where - if you were
alone - you might die of fright. The elation you experience makes the guide
worth every centime.
My visit to Verbier was organised by Ski Thomson, Greater London House,
Hampstead Road, London, NW1 7SD. Telephone 081-200-8733. I stayed in the
Chalet Mont Clair (prices from Pounds 297 including cooked breakfast,
afternoon tea and dinner with wine. Our chalet person, Sarah Armstrong, made
delicious cakes, excellent porridge and was patient with two exuberant
under-fives in our party.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Sport: Lone Star state of mind - Dallas fans won't hear of
Super Bowl defeat / American Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANYWHERE in the US can lay claim to being the heart of American football
country, it is Texas. Many states provide more players to the professional
game. Some have more NFL teams and blue-chip, football-playing universities
 -but there is nowhere quite like Texas when it comes to passion for the
sport.
It is no surprise, then, that Texans are going wild over tomorrow's Super
Bowl at Pasadena, California, which pits their beloved Dallas Cowboys
against the Buffalo Bills from New York state.
Their enthusiasm for the game starts at the lowest level. Texas is mad about
high school football. 'A typical game in the city will draw between 5,000
and 10,000 people,' says Steve Davies, a sports reporter at the Dallas
Morning Herald.
'In the smaller towns, the crowds are the same which means that, in some
places, about 20 per cent of the local population is often at the game.'
Indeed, high school football is most popular in country areas - and not just
because it is often the only action in town other than the rodeo. For as
long as anyone can remember, rural Texas has been producing big, brave farm
boys suited ideally, in physique and temperament, to the bone-crunching
rigours of the gridiron.
The link between farming and football reaches its apotheosis at Texas
Agricultural and Mechanical, the finest footballing university in the state.
This year, A &amp; M attracted crowds of up to 80,000 as they won all their
games in the regular season and challenged for the title of national college
champions.
At professional level, football mania reaches even greater heights. Two
weeks ago, the Cowboys held a rally at their stadium in the city's outskirts
for fans wanting to boost the players in their bid to win the club's first
Super Bowl since 1978. On a dull, rainy mid-week day, 70,000 people turned
up.
The rally was shown live on local television and repeated on the same
channel two nights later, attracting big ratings both times.
Even the Lone Star state's most famous entertainment export cannot compete.
The Cowboys' National Football League championship game against San
Francisco two Sundays ago attracted the biggest local television audience
ever in their home town, far outstripping the record held by the 'Who Shot
JR?' episode of the soap opera Dallas.
Although Texans are an hospitable bunch, the football fans sometimes take
their fanaticism to absurd limits. When the Philadelphia Eagles arrived
earlier this month to contest the Eastern Division title, shopkeepers in the
Dallas area removed cartons of Philadelphia soft cheese from their shelves.
And Buffalo, Texas, (population 1,900), has changed its name - to Blue Star
 -for this weekend.
The irony of the Cowboys' wonderful run this year is that the chief
architects - Jerry Jones, the owner, and Jimmy Johnson, the coach - both are
former star footballers at the University of Arkansas, a great college rival
of Texas A &amp; M and the University of Texas, and just a few miles across the
Texas state line.
The two Arkansas alumni took charge of the Cowboys 3 1/2 years ago. After a
couple of disastrous seasons, their drive to turn round a dispirited club
and a struggling team began to pay off.
After winning only one game in the 1989 season, Dallas improved so rapidly
that this year they won 13 of the 16 regular season matches.
Jones and Johnson have been ruthless in re-shaping the club - the old
management was purged and unwanted players traded away to make room for
fresh faces. They have shown a willingness to gamble, too, both with the
selection of their teams and with the plays that have been called during
games.
Like the Miami University team that Johnson coached to a national college
championship late in the 1980s, the Cowboys are built on speed, or what
American footballers call 'quickness' - which means speed and agility over
short distances, and an ability to think and react quickly in tight,
unscripted situations.
Dallas exploits that quickness with a flexible, attacking game that is
comfortable both running and passing the ball. In recent games, the Cowboys'
offence has been as swift, precise and potent as the San Francisco 49ers'
attack during their long reign in the 1980s as the NFL's best team. The
comparison was not lost on some of the San Francisco players who faced the
Cowboys a fortnight ago. 'It looked like we were playing the mirror image of
ourselves at times,' said Jesse Sapolu, one of the 49ers' key offensive
players.
Although the bookmakers have installed the Cowboys as the favourites
tomorrow, many wise heads are warning that the Bills (who have been to, but
lost, the past two Super Bowls, the 1991 game by a single point) will have
much more big-game experience - Dallas are the youngest team in the NFL,
with an average age of 26.
Young they may be, but there is no shortage of confidence from the Dallas
players. As Emmitt Smith, their star 23-year-old running back, said so
disarmingly this week: 'Experience? How much experience do you need to play
in a Super Bowl? I've been running the ball my whole life. What more
experience do I need?'

FT  30 JAN 93 / Drink: For bottled beer, British is best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR WINE drinkers, certain grape varieties become fashionable for a year or
two, then fall from grace; while brands of spirits are favoured by drinkers
who would be hard-pressed to tell you why. It is all to do with marketing -
and beer is the most fashion-conscious of the lot.
Take imported bottled beers. It is possible to draw up a sort of Chinese
horoscope based on what has been the fashionable beer of the year. In 1992,
American bottled lagers made great headway in the UK, although most are
irredeemably dull. In 1991, it was Mexican beers with a wedge of lime
(drunk, of course, from the bottle), while 1990 was the year of Japanese
'dry'. As for 1989, I seem to recall it was San Miguel. Whichever they were,
though, we can be quite certain of one thing: flavour was unimportant.
Last summer, I lived through a German heat-wave. So, I thought I would try
out Weizen, or wheat beers. These sometimes are drunk in Germany with a
slice of lemon but I cannot see why, as all of them have a strong lemony
taste to start with.
The best are the hefeweizen, which undergo a second fermentation in bottle
with added yeasts; thus, the beer is cloudy and full of flavour. Comparing
the hefeweizen available in Berlin, I found the best were Maisels from
Bayreuth and Scherdel, although Thurn und Taxis was nearly as good. I have
not seen any of these in Britain but I am sure they could take the market by
storm.
Spurred by all this, the Weekend FT decided to taste some of the bottled
beers on sale in Britain. Apart from one made in London (which actually
topped the league), and one from Scotland, all were imported. The tasters
were myself; Iain Loe, from the Campaign for Real Ale; and Max Wilkinson,
editor of the Weekend FT. The beers were scored out of 20 and are listed in
descending order.
1: Very Special Christmas Ale (England), 16 points. This one English beer
beat all comers. 'Excellent in its way,' said Wilkinson. 'Needs to be drunk
at the end of a meal,' warned Loe, referring to its 8.9 per cent alcohol -
stronger than many German wines.
Equal 2: Hoegaarden White (Germany) and Liberty Ale (California), 15.6. The
Hoegaarden is not quite a Weizen as it has less than 50 per cent wheat. On
the other hand, it contains coriander and curacao and comes out slightly
cloudy. There was considerable enthusiasm for this beer and its spicy
bouquet, which sells from Whitbread pubs. The Liberty has a markedly fruity,
hoppy character.
4: Brigand (Belgium), 15.3. This Belgian beer, with nine per cent alcohol,
comes in a 75 cl bottle with a champagne cork. It has a lemony taste, which
Loe put down to the yeast. Wilkinson called it 'rather nice'.
5: Alpirsbacher Hefeweizen (Germany), 14.8. Our first hefeweizen. I did not
think it was quite up to my favourites in Germany and it seemed a little
bright for the type. But Wilkinson thought it 'jolly good beer, almost the
best here'.
Equal 6: Coopers Sparkling Ale (Australia) and Regal Christmas (Belgium),
14.6. Coopers, from South Australia, has been a personal favourite since I
first tasted it on High Eden Ridge near Adelaide. It is sold by Oddbins for
99p. The Regal is a strong Christmas ale the colour of cafe au lait and
smelling of baked bananas, with nine per cent alcohol.
8: Chimay Red Label (Belgium), 14.3. Loe pointed out that this was the
weakest of the Chimay beers, with seven degrees. A special yeast is used to
give it its considerable character.
9: Traquair House Ale (Scotland), 13.6. This is made in the oldest house
north of the border. It is a deep amber ale with 'great charm'.
10: Erdinger Dunkel (Germany), 13.3. A generation ago, Bavarians drank these
dark malt lagers in preference to bright beers. The team admired its
character and markedly hoppy finish.
11: Grolsch Bok (Holland), 13.0. This is the autumn 'Bock' version of the
famous Grolsch - spelled 'Bok' in Dutch. Beer of this sort is brewed with
extra strength for the onset of winter. The result is rather sweet:
something to steel your limbs before going out to work in the fields.
12: Singha (Thailand), 12.8. This beer is surprisingly full of flavour and
proved one of Loe's favourites. Wilkinson found it 'too bitter' and lacking
in aroma.
13: Zambezi (Zimbabwe), 12.1. Again, this came as a surprise. A lager with
real character.
14: Ostravar (Moravia), 11.6. A pilsner type. I was not keen, but Loe
praised the after-taste and Wilkinson liked the 'agreeable bitterness'.
15: Kriek (Belgium), 11.3. This beer is called 'Mort Subite' (sudden death)
and is made with spontaneous yeasts and macerated cherries. I liked it, but
Loe detected added sugar and Wilkinson thought it no more than a curiosity.
16: Stella 'Dry' (Belgium), 10.8. Mixed views again on this Belgian-brewed
Stella. Wilkinson liked it, Loe and I dissented.
17: Heineken Export (Holland), 10.6. The votes went the other way round for
this Dutch-brewed Heineken. I liked a gentle whiff of honey.
The other beers failed to make half-marks. We thought the Kaltenberg Pils
would be better brewed in Bavaria, rather than our Whitbread-brewed sample.
Tiger from Singapore, Cascade from Tasmania, a UK-brewed Stella and a San
Miguel look-alike from Spain called (appropriately enough) Damm all seemed
to lack character. The feeling among the tasters was that these brews were
best drunk when it was very hot and you were too thirsty to notice.
A Jamaican beer called Kalik smelled of manure. Having said that, it will
almost certainly become this year's fashionable sensation.
The speciality beers are available from the Beer Shop, 8 Pitfield Street,
London N1 (tel: 071-739-3701) and Grogblossom, 66 Notting Hill Gate, London
W11 and branches (tel: 071-792-3834).
A number of gift boxes are available by mail order.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Of rice and men; the thoughts of a mobster: John Plender is
given a background briefing on Japan from an unlikely source
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SEEMED, in a well-worn phrase, to be a good idea at the time. I was
making a television programme on Japan for a series on business and
economics. The yakuza, Japan's notorious mobsters who sport neck-to-ankle
tattoos, appeared to be cropping up in one political or financial scandal
after another. Clearly, meeting a mobster was essential to a proper
understanding of the financial crash that has rocked the country.
Misgivings set in as we approached the Kyoto headquarters of the man who is
ranked by the police as Japan's fourth-biggest gangland boss. Our charming
and super-efficient Japanese fixer was becoming more nervous by the minute.
Matters did not improve when we were whisked into a building by a swaggering
character in a brown suit who sported a truncated little finger - a penalty
the yakuza impose on themselves when they commit acts of disloyalty. Young
thugs in blue uniforms watched as we lugged in our equipment.
Then came the first surprise - or perhaps I should say test. The boss,
Tokutaro Takayama, was not ready to be filmed. As we waited, two of the men
in blue appeared with a substantial meal for us. We had finished lunch only
half an hour before. No problem here for a camera crew, since the first rule
of their trade is to seize every chance to eat because they never know when
the next will come.
For less robust seekers after truth such as reporters, producers and
directors, it was another matter, especially since our Japanese colleague -
now sweating profusely - was urging us to behave with all possible decorum.
We prodded our noodles, wondering how the yakuza, who regard themselves as
the guardians of traditional Japanese values, dealt with bad table manners.
The next surprise came with the boss himself. A splendid pair of sideburns
apart, there was little to distinguish him, in his spacious office, from the
chairman of any large Japanese corporation. Perhaps the oversize statue of
Napoleon beside his desk was a bit of a giveaway but, in most other
respects, Takayama had absolutely nothing in common with Al Capone. For a
start, he had written a book, full of warnings about the condition of modern
Japan.
Nearer to the Mafia, maybe? Absolutely and emphatically not, he insisted;
the yakuza, unlike the Mafia, were patriotic and generally supportive of
government. But with reservations. To my amazement, this gangland boss
proceeded to harangue me about the awfulness of the politicians' failure to
liberalise the rice market.
The basis of Takayama's objection was that the politicians were making life
needlessly expensive for the Japanese people. Perhaps, ideologically
speaking, that sat neatly with the yakuza's romanticised view of themselves
as latter-day Robin Hoods (no pun in Japanese). It was certainly sound
economics, showing a firm grasp of the law of comparative advantage.
If Takayama sounded like a free market businessman, it was because this was
 -in part, at least - how he saw himself. His smart office block turned out
to contain a boardroom, a lecture theatre, gym and kitchen, plus a dormitory
for the blue-clad apprentices. There were some tacky features: a giant
stuffed polar bear in a glass case outside the boss's office, and a battery
of electronic surveillance equipment to monitor what was going on outside.
But, in most other respects, Aizu Kotetsu-kai, as the outfit was called, had
the trappings of a mini-Hitachi or Toyota.
The reason the yakuza are able to maintain such offices openly is that the
Japanese, in their bizarrely pragmatic way, have privatised much of the law
and order process. Since the days of the Tokugawa Shogunate, the feudal
period which ended with the Meiji restoration of 1868, gangsters have helped
the police keep violence off the streets. In the post-war period, these
outsiders were used by businessmen to intimidate unions and collect debts.
Politicians used them as bodyguards and sought their organisation's votes
and money.
The free market ideology does not. however, extend fully to the yakuza's own
activities. The trade-off with the police was that the big crime syndicates
would keep non-syndicated crime under control. In other words, it operated
in much the same heavily regulated way as Japan's industrial cartels. Only
in the bubble economy of the late 1980s did things get out of hand as the
gangs started to rig share markets, deal in property and shoot each other in
the streets.
In spite of their unwholesome activities in extortion, gambling and
prostitution, the yakuza were tolerated as part of the system so long as the
system itself appeared to deliver the goods. And that was Takayama's
problem. Since the bursting of the Japanese bubble, people are disillusioned
with a system that has wiped out much of their savings while the big shots -
including politicians, big businessmen and yakuza - have enjoyed
considerable protection from loss.
The public also has been enraged to discover that unelected yakuza may have
played a key role in making Noboru Takeshita prime minister in 1987; he was
forced to resign later over a share scandal. So the politicians have been
forced to clamp down on gangland with the 'Law to Prevent Unjust Action of
Violent Organisations,' which took effect last March.
The yakuza, says Takayama, have been made the scapegoats for the
politicians' misdeeds. 'They've been totally disrespectful of our rights,'
he complained. And he has been subjected to what, in Japan, is the most
unspeakable form of ostracism: he is no longer allowed to be a member of a
golf club.

MY ARTICLE on January 9 mistakenly reported that Simmons &amp; Simmons and
Jackson-Stops says in its Guide to the Legislation Relating to Listed
Buildings that the law requires such buildings to be maintained.
Owners may, however, be served repair notices or a compulsory purchase order
if the building is becoming derelict. After a fire, there is no explicit
obligation to rebuild, but restoration work would usually require consent.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Property: Radon - the natural gas that can kill in the home
 -Five counties have particular problems but there are plenty of ways to
head off the potential dangers. Gerald Cadogan explains how
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TESTS for a natural radioactive gas called radon are being made at 24 houses
in my Northamptonshire village and 700 in the surrounding district. Radon
increases the chances of lung cancer, but it was almost unknown to most
people until quite recently. Is it really a danger? Will it affect the value
of your house? What can you do about it?
For most of the country, the risk is negligible. You are in slightly more
danger if you live in certain areas of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset,
Northamptonshire and Derbyshire. Yet, even in these 'hot' spots, the level
of radon can vary greatly between one house and its neighbour. And in 'safe'
parts of the country, the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) is
surprised constantly to find isolated cases of a high radon count.
Radon is emitted by the trace levels of uranium that occur in soil and rocks
(and bricks and concrete made from them). Fresh air disperses it, but it can
accumulate inside a building or down a mine (research into its dangers began
with the case histories of uranium miners and scientists in the early days
of nuclear physics). When breathed in, it deposits alpha particles in the
lungs.
Dr Robert Stoddart, senior lecturer in pathology at Manchester university,
calls these 'seriously radioactive - an unpleasant form of radiation.' It
is, however, only one of many carcinogens. As Stoddart points out: 'We all
live in a soup of them, to which we are variably susceptible.'
Many things can trigger a cancer - even bracken - and it is hard to point
the finger only at radon. The factors that matter are the local geology; how
your house is built; and your own body, which might - or might not - proof
you against any amount of radon radiation.
If you live in or near an affected area, it is sensible to check the level
in your house. Ask the NRPB to send you plastic monitors, or your district
council to arrange this for you. There is no charge. But remember that radon
does harm only through exposure over many years. A holiday in Cornwall is
not going to give you cancer.
Radon enters houses through cracks in floors and walls. The uranium-bearing
granite country of Devon and Cornwall has been known for some time as a hot
spot, as is similar terrain in New Hampshire and Sweden. But not all granite
is dangerous.
Cumbria is safe; and even in Cornwall, where about a fifth of the houses are
above what the NRPB calls the 'action level' - when something must be done
to reduce the concentration - granite walls and fireplaces do not emit much
radon. Now, though, the list of affected areas has expanded to Somerset,
Derbyshire and Northamptonshire, with their limestone and sandstone. But
Somerset seems rather better off than the other two counties where more than
10 per cent of houses are above the action level in west Derbyshire, and
around Northampton and Kettering, In neighbouring north Oxfordshire, NRPB
tests have confirmed a local council's soil gas survey which suggested a
potential radon problem in some houses.
The board estimates that around 100,000 houses in the UK are above the
action level, although the problem decreases markedly as you go east. And,
luckily, the great conurbations are not in radon zones, although London has
its own geological problem of shrinking clay And subsidence. In Wales, there
is a slight concentration in Powys; and, in Scotland, at the north-east tip
and on Deeside. Perhaps the Queen will put in monitors at Balmoral.
The NRPB is making a detailed survey using postcodes to isolate houses in
groups of 15 or fewer. It sends two monitors, to be placed in the main
living room and main bedroom for three months. On their return, the board
analyses the readings, enters them into its data base and informs you. The
whole process takes about five months. District councils also are eager to
know your readings so they can prepare their own detailed local radon maps
(they promise to keep the results as confidential as if they were about
HIV).
Double glazing and insulation have increased radon levels because they stop
the gas dispersing. And it accumulates more in winter, when windows are
shut. Open fires, and open windows in upstairs bedrooms (but not
downstairs), increase the amount as they pull air upwards through the house.
Draughty old houses are an effective antidote; so are those with suspended
floors with air circulating beneath. Cellars may increase the amount, as
they have a greater area (walls and floors) exposed to the soil.
If your floor is solid, you can instal a sump underneath, with pipes and a
fan to extract the radon-carrying air and send it up to disperse at roof
level. If the floor is suspended, you can seal it (although, if it is
wooden, this might increase the chance of dry rot).
Improving the ventilation by more air bricks is another option. Or use a fan
to blow fresh air into the house (although this is effective only up to two
or three times the action level). Try opening more windows downstairs and do
not use any extractor fans in kitchens, bathrooms and lavatories.
You can also seal unused chimneys and give up open fires (including gas
fires that look as if they are burning coal). At the end of all this, repeat
the monitor tests to check how successful you have been.
Make sure your builder knows about radon. Ask your local authority about
(means-tested) house renovation grants, or discretionary repair grants in
Scotland; the environmental health officer should be helpful.
If you are building in an affected area, the special building regulations
for Devon and Cornwall are extended to the other three hot counties from
February 1. In the most-affected part of Northamptonshire, this will mean
putting a membrane in the floor, joining it to the wall and arranging space
for a sump and fan. After a year of living in the new house, it can be
tested to see if they are needed.
If you are buying in a radon zone, ask the seller for the results of any
tests. But do not let radon deter you from the five hot counties. They are
marvellous places in which to live. And, as you know the risks, they should
not affect the price. The reaper is waiting to scythe us all, anywhere and
any time.

helpful. Enquiries to Room A518, Romney House, 43 Marsham Street, London

FT  30 JAN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Two companies struggling from the
Belfast ruins - Jimmy Burns visits a business park on the dividing line
between catholic and protestant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FARSET Enterprise business park in West Belfast backs off against an
18ft high fence separating two communities: protestant and catholic. Its
front gate gives on to the Springfield Road, a notorious killing ground for
the terrorists on both sides.
Eight years ago the site was a piece of open ground: the houses that once
stood there bombed to ruins. It became a community centre, and subsequently
a business park, as a result of government investment aimed at healing the
wounds of sectarian division.
Farset is one of 26 business parks in Belfast, but the only one established
where the the two communities meet. It is something of a test case for small
businesses struggling to survive against the background of recession and a
relentless campaign of political violence.
Since the park opened three and half years ago, three small businesses have
failed. But among the dozen that have survived, two in particular have shown
what can be achieved when all the odds seemed stacked against them.
Northern Ireland Fireworks
has managed to carve a business niche with full government approval even
though under Northern Ireland law the sale of fireworks manufactured locally
is banned.
It is run by Danny Davison, a 40-year-old former lorry driver who worked
part-time, gathering experience of fireworks in companies in the UK and the
US. In November 1990, Davison approached the Local Enterprise Development
Unit LEDU (the goverment backed small business agency) for a Pounds 6,000
grant, and the Farset Business Park, which draws some if its funds from the
International Fund for Ireland, for a further Pounds 5,000 low-interest loan
(6 per cent repayable over two years) to set himself up as Northern
Ireland's only local 'supplier of display kits and operator of fired shows.'
A further Pounds 2,000 came from Davison's own savings and that of his
partner.
Davison imports his fireworks from England and mainland Europe under licence
and then arranges their display with the approval of the security forces and
the Northern Ireland Office.
In the first year of trading in 1990/91 turnover was Pounds 24,000, just
below the target of Pounds 25,000. In 1991/92 the company's order book
expanded with turnover to Pounds 52,000, above the year's target of Pounds
50,000. A business that began with two full time staff, and two part-time
staff, now employs 19.
Davison says the company is successful because: 'What we try and give the
public is something that is spectacular, but colourful and peaceful at the
same time. There is no danger and the whole family can enjoy it. It makes a
change from bombs.'
He works from a ramshackle two floor hangar, filled with bits of cardboard,
and rough sketched lay-outs. Here Davison tailors his display according to
the budget of the customer, working out the position of the fireworks, the
sequence of their explosions, on frames which range in height from 50ft to
3,000ft.
The company arranges small displays for children's parties and club events,
but its main income is generated by big public displays arranged for borough
council festivals. Its customers have included staunchly loyalist
organisations in the Shankill Road, as well as catholic charity events in
southern Ireland.
Among its more spectacular projects was the organisation of the firework
display for Belfast's Christmas celebrations at the end of 1991.
Politics is never far from this potentially explosive business. 'I know that
if I moved this business to the Shankill some of the boys who work with me
wouldn't come,' says Davison.
And yet management of the business park has a policy of picking its tenants
according to strict financial criteria.
Charlotte McFarlane, the business park's administrator, says: 'We don't ask
people what religion they belong to here. A business is a business or its
not.'
Its a philosophy which Davison shares. 'We straddle both sides of the
community here,' he says.
Bob Jenkins's flat Midlands accent is scarcely audible above the din of his
workshop, but there is no doubting his determination to make his presence
felt.
'I've got the distinction of being the only Englishman who stayed on. I like
the place,' says Jenkins.
A decade ago Jenkins worked as a quality engineer for the De Lorean sports
car plant in Belfast. When the plant closed in 1983, some of the workers
returned to England from where they had been recruited initially.
Jenkins married a local woman and took a job with United Technologies in
Derry. He subsequently sought employment in England, but not for long. In
the mid-1980s the couple returned to Northern Ireland for an event that was
to change the pattern of their lives: the birth of their child Laura Lee.
When a spinal tumour left the child paraplegic Jenkins decided to put all
his efforts into using his skills to develop orthopedic equipment for the
physically handicapped.
The idea for the company with his daughter's name arose out of Jenkins'
links with Belfast's specialist Musgrave Park Hospital which adapted a
wheelchair for Laura Lee.
Jenkins recalls: 'At the time I was out of a job. One of the consultant
orthopedic surgeons who knew I'd been an engineer said, 'There are various
products the hospital is developing, why not start up your own business and
see if you can help out?''
Jenkins in 1989 was among the first small business men to enter Farset. He
obtained a capital grant of Pounds 5,100 covering 50 per cent of the cost of
new plant and machinery and an employment related grant of Pounds 6,300 from
LEDU. He also got a Pounds 3,100 grant from the Government's Making Belfast
Work initiative specifically targetted at businesses in deprived areas of
the city.
His company's turnover was Pounds 10,000 in 1990/91, below the Pounds 12,000
target. In 1991/92 turnover was Pounds 17,000 below a target of Pounds
22,000.
In his workshop Jenkins has been developing a range of products for disabled
people ranging from special potty chairs and toilet training aids for
children to suspended arm support systems for muscular dystrophy patients.
But Jenkins admits that struggling to stay financially afloat in the middle
of the recession has not been easy. He is about to go into partnership with
another larger company at Farset which does structural steel and ornamental
cast iron work.
'I hope to have the cash flow necessary to research and develop new products
over a longer period, ' says Jenkins.
'The best small businesses can hope for in this society is to survive. I may
not have grown much, but I'm still here. That gives me a sense of
achievement.'

FT  30 JAN 93 / As They Say In Europe: Celebrating with an old mistress - Do
you remember Sarajevo? James Morgan explains a lovers' tiff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH press has been celebrating the 30th anniversary of friendship
with Germany. It has done so in the manner that a mistress might celebrate
the 30th anniversary of an affair in which the man has not done the decent
thing.
Nowadays, Germany spends even less time with its lover, devoting more
attention to its poverty stricken cousins. As a result, perhaps, it
willingly pays billions to maintain that jewel of the relationship, the
French franc, in pristine condition - just to keep the old girl quiet.
Le Monde likes this but is critical of the way Germany organises its
domestic affairs: '. . . the great neighbour beyond the Rhine is even
renouncing financial and budgetary balance which is foreseen in the
Maastricht Treaty. Germany is no longer worthy of the model it created.'
The rest of the press clings to the exchange rate as the symbol of the
Franco-German motor behind the construction of Europe, even though it is
driving France into the ground. Le Figaro remarked, wistfully, that the
balance of forces since the creation of the partnership had been reversed,
'which should not make France forget Germany has need of her.'
This is not wholly appreciated in Germany. The publicity given to the
anniversary was far less there than west of the Rhine. And signs of
hostility are growing. A refrain of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung these
days is that France is not pulling its weight against Serbia. It publicises
Bosnian politicians who say that Paris (and London) supports Belgrade. This
week the chief fulminator of that powerful paper, Johann Georg Reissmuller
returned from his long hagiographic hibernation in Croatia, to accuse
France, along with Serbia, of having disrupted the twentieth century.
'The successful murder attack against the heir to the Austrian throne was
the prelude to the first world war in which France and Serbia stood side by
side.'
Surely there was a bit more to the 1914-18 affair than that.
The account continued with how, in the inter-war years, Serbia tried to
dominate the south Slav kingdom. France promoted it as a counterweight to
Italy, actively promoting expansionism. In the second world war, 'Tito
fought against Hitler and Mussolini because he wanted a Bolshevik
Yugoslavia.' The subsequent 'Tito-state' rivalled the Soviet Union in
brutality. And when President Mitterrand fetched up in Sarajevo last June it
was certainly not to stop the Serbs.
As an account of the past 80 years, Reissmuller's story leaves a few gaps -
such as the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia in 1914 which was designed to start
a war. Then there was the creation by Germany of the Croatian fascist state
in 1941. And, of course, Tito was not a Serb - he was half Croat and half
Slovene - and the Serbs knew it.
It is one thing to argue that the men who run Serbia today are horrible and
mad. It is another to offer passionate support to one side or the other in
this affair. In the week where the Croats broke a ceasefire, killing two
French UN soldiers in the process, the German papers said that was all they
could do in the circumstances. Perhaps someone in western Europe could face
up to this question: do the leading members of the Community have different
foreign policy interests or not?
The Germans, it seems, have those of 1914, at least when seen from the
perspective of Reissmuller. If they have not changed, have those of France
and Britain? And, the most vital issue of all, what will Russia do if
Germany sets out to teach Serbia a lesson?
All this occurs in the week when the US appears to have accepted that
Germany and Japan should become permanent members of the Security Council.
Why not, if Germany, at least, is rediscovering the notion of the national
interest? The Security Council has been getting rather dull.
Britain has the fewest problems in dealing with with this evolving
situation. The French papers rightly believe that Britain has returned to a
kind of isolationism and ask where this leaves France and its friendship
with Germany.
Writing in La Tribune Desfosses, Philippe Labarde says: 'Who has profited
most from this strange marriage? According to the polls in each country it
is always the other.'
He adds, hopefully, that the essence is that France and Germany believe in
the same model of society. The two draw closer together to pass through hard
tests. 'This is in order to forget that less than 50 years ago it seemed to
them both to be just as evident that they had to make war.'
It is a tedious cliche to remark on the nightmarish coincidence that it
should be Sarajevo that is at the centre of so many anxieties. But the
parallels with 1914 run deeper: the city could again symbolise the real
differences that exist between France and Germany. Surely nobody in Germany
can want to pick a fight over that all over again . . .

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE HAD a protected tenancy with a private sector landlord for the past
eight years. The property now needs a substantial amount of money spent on
it, including a modern heating system, to which the landlord is unwilling to
contribute. How can I ensure that any improvements I make to the fabric of
the property do not result in the rent officer determining a higher 'fair
rent' when he next inspects the property?
You should write to the rent officer asking him to note on the file that you
are effecting improvements, as the landlord refuses to do them, and give a
brief description of what they are and the cost.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax relief on a farm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ELDERLY spinster owns and farms 250 acres of land in Scotland. Her
nearest relatives are two nieces, both in their twenties. Neither would be
able to continue the business but they would stand to inherit any money on
the death of their aunt. The farm would be sold.
Would the money realised be eligible for inheritance tax relief at 100 per
cent and would capital gains tax relief be passed to the nieces, or do the
concessions benefit only sons and daughters of a farmer?
For IHT purposes, and provided certain conditions were met, 100 per cent
agricultural relief would be available on the agricultural property on the
death of an aunt where she both owned and farmed the property.
The conditions are that the property must have been either:
(a) occupied by the aunt for the purposes of agriculture throughout the
period of two years ending with the date of death; or
(b) owned by the aunt for a period of seven years ending with the date of
her death, and occupied throughout that period by her or another person for
the purposes of agriculture.
The property would not be subject to CGT on death and would, in fact, be
revalued for CGT purposes so that the base value of the property would be
revised to the value as at the date of death.

IF A BANK agrees to accept less than the total amount of an overdraft or
loan due to it by a partnership, must the amount written off by the bank be
added to the partnership profits for income tax purposes?
Only to the extent that the amount written off represents bank charges,
interest etc for which tax relief has been allowed already.
Such items are caught by section 94 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act
1988 under the heading of 'Debts deducted and subsequently released.' It
states:
'Where in computing for tax purposes the profits or gains of a trade,
profession or vocation, a deduction has been allowed for any debt incurred
for the purposes of the trade, profession or vocation, then, if the whole or
any part of the debt is thereafter released, the amount released shall be

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEASE to my flat requires me to contribute to the costs incurred by the
landlord in 'all provision of services referred to in the second schedule.'
The second schedule refers to:
The maintenance of the main structure and, in particular, the roof, main
walls and timber foundations and main drains, gutters and rain-water pipes
of the building, including all party walls and structures, sewers or drains
used in common.
The maintenance of the gas and water pipes, drains, sewers electric cables
and wires and apparatus, in and under the building, and used in common.
The water tanks on the roof were replaced recently and I am being asked to
contribute to the cost. In 1987, I provided my flat with its own independent
water tanks. Since then, I have not used water from the tanks on the roof.
Am I required to pay my contribution or can I decline to do so because of
the particular wording of the clause above?
You are still required to make the contribution for which the lease
provides, even if you have opted out of using the common tanks. The position
is the same as if the owner of a flat on the first floor decided to use the
stairs only and then sought not to contribute to lift maintenance.
The position would be different if there were only two flats in the
building.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cheap cover for classics in the garage
 -A look at insurance for classic cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLASSIC car enthusiasts are a special breed. That at least, is the
conclusion of their insurers who offer a different type of policy for the
proud owners of a much-loved Jensen or Alfa Romeo 'Spider.'
The main attraction of this type of insurance, provided by brokers and many
of the big insurance companies, is the much lower annual premiums. Martin
Cooke of Bain Clarkson insurance brokers (0384- 455011), estimates that
someone owning a Ferrari or Bentley, requiring annual insurance premiums of
Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,000 under a standard policy, would find them reduced
to Pounds 800-Pounds 900 under classic car insurance.
To enjoy the lower premiums, classic car owners are expected to cherish
their car and not use it for mundane purposes, such as transport. 'The
average owner of a collector's car will keep it in a garage, look after it
carefully and will not use it for everyday driving,' said Mike Chamberlin of
John Scott and partners (081-977-9121), one of the first brokers to
specialise in classic and vintage cars. These conditions mean reduced risk,
which is why the classic car insurance market can insure expensive cars
relatively cheaply.
Classic car insurance differs in two main ways from standard policies which
use bandings for cars depending on model, engine size and the age of the
driver.
Instead, the agreed value of the car and the amount of driving the car is
expected to do are the basis for theinsurance
Norwich Union's Collectors Car policy (0603-622200), will cover the
policyholder against accident, damage and total loss on an agreed value
basis. 'Premiums are worked out on the value of the car rather than its
group rating,' said James Duffell of Norwich Union. 'Since a classic 1950s
car, saloon or sports car are all expected to be driven in much the same
way, only the value of the car is relevant.'
An Alvis, a Bristol or an Aston Martin would all fall into the same
insurance bracket if it was agreed their value was the same.
Settling on a value can be difficult in a market which has not found itself
immune to the problems of recession. Those who bought at the top of the
market in 1989, when prices for some classics had quadrupled in a few years,
found that the value of their cars fell by as much as half. For this reason,
the value of the car may need to be reassessed at intervals.
Since the car is not expected to be used daily, premiums are based on
maximum mileage - which is not usually a consideration under a standard
policy. The most common mileage band is for a maximum of 3,000 miles a year,
although some policies allow up to 4,500 miles or even 6,000 miles.
Unlimited mileage policies may be available but the cost of premiums will be
much higher. Bain Clarkson, for example, will offer standard rates but with
the insurance being on an agreed value basis.
The car does not have to be expensive to qualify for classic car insurance -
Morris Minors and Sunbeam Alpines are common risks - but it must be old.
'The car must be at least 20 years old, though we do make exceptions, for
example, for Morgans,' said Peter Fry of KGM Motor Policies (081-530- 7351),
a Lloyds syndicate which is another veteran of the classic car market.
Bain Clarkson will also insure younger cars but for higher premiums. The
annual premiums for a 1980 Mercedes 450 SL, with an agreed value of Pounds
9,000 will, for example, be Pounds 300 for a 3,000 mile maximum and Pounds
460 for a maximum of 6,000 miles a year.
Young drivers are not welcome. Most classic car insurers will base premiums
on a minimum of 30 years for the driver. Cover may be available for those
who are younger for higher premiums.
Annual premiums for a classic car worth Pounds 5,000, such as a Morris 1000,
insured for a maximum mileage of 3,000 are in the region of Pounds
110-Pounds 115 under classic car insurance. KGM estimates that for the same
mileage, annual premiums for a fully comprehensive policy on a Pounds 10,000
car (such as a 1970 E-type Jaguar or a TR2) would be Pounds 170 and on a
Pounds 20,000 car (a Mercedes 190 SL, for example), Pounds 253.
The market has been affected by the rise in crime which has led to steeply
increased premiums in the motor insurance industry as a whole. Bain
Clarkson's Cooke says that for the first time in 20 years, classic car
insurers have been obliged to raise premiums, by an average of 25 per cent
this year because of increased theft. In addition, insurers are beginning to
insist on lock-up garages for cars and are stipulating that the policyholder
should have another car for normal daily driving, with the classic car
reserved only for 'social, domestic and pleasure purposes.'
Fry's KGM says that it tries to avoid 'off the road' cover, when cheaper
insurance is provided for the car which is not being driven. Norwich Union
will still provide off the road cover, which includes accidental damage,
loss or damage by fire or theft, particularly for those who are doing
restoration work to the car.
What if the worst happens and your cherished Bugatti has a crash and is
deemed a write-off? 'Sometimes a car has been passed on from father to son
through generations and the owner will want to retain and restore the car
whatever,' says Chamberlin. The best classic car insurance policies should
have a salvage clause allowing the owner to retain the salvage after an
accident. John Scott has arrangements with two insurers: under its Lloyd's
scheme, the settlement would be limited to 80 per cent of the insured value
while a scheme underwritten by General Accident will allow the owner to have
the car repaired and reimbursed up to the insured value.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Making sense of chaos - Bernice Cohen
says charts dispel the casino image of share investing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNICE COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST INVESTORS plan their decisions purely on criteria gleaned from
financial data relating to a company's performance. They disregard charts as
voodoo magic.
In contrast, technical analysts seek guidance on probable future share price
movements from market statistics, supplemented by charts where recurring
patterns provide buy and sell indicators.
As a dedicated DIMI (Do-It-Myself Investor), planning my portfolio from my
own research efforts, I prefer a belt and braces approach. Fundamental and
technical analysis should be complementary tools in a fully-rounded
investment system.
When asked, 'Why bother with charts?' technical analysts often give
defensive replies. Charts, they suggest, reveal the human psychology of the
struggles between buyers and sellers in a competitive market under the twin
stresses of greed and fear. Yet I believe the central rationale for charting
stems from the possibility that charts reflect the presence of chaos in
financial markets.
Observing the everyday mayhem surrounding most financial markets, the
suggestion that they are chaotic makes sense, at least superficially.
However, chaos is actually a formal, relatively new science centred on
mathematics. If it could be convincingly shown to apply to financial
markets, that scientific base would lend respectability to counter the
casino image. Intriguingly, most chaotic systems share a group of typical
characteristics which are instantly seen to apply to unruly stock markets.
They are highly complex systems comprising numerous interacting elements.
They are inherently unstable with continuously changing behaviour.
It is extremely difficult to predict their future conduct since numerous
different outcomes are equally possible.
They are intrinsically irregular and prone to trends and cycles.
They are described by a mathematical geometry called fractal which can be
shown on graphs.
Fractal shapes, like the frost patterns on cold windows, have essentially
the same pattern at any selected scale. In nature, ocean ripples create the
same patterns as giant waves, while a local topography of bays and inlets
takes a similar pattern to the overall coastline viewed from the air.
These features are all typical of financial charts, supporting the notion
that they reveal chaos in the market. Because chaotic systems can move in
one of several different directions, charts offer visual images for
interpreting share price gyrations, often by highlighting trends which are
hard to spot within a welter of tabulated statistics. They help to sift out
vital information from background noise.
This logic underpins the use of moving averages (MA). By smoothing out local
irregularities, they expose the underlying trends. And because they derive
from the same price series, they are fractal, with similar structure across
every scale - for five, 20, 50 or 200-day MAs.
Moving average calculations give three helpful buy signals; first when the
share price rises through its average, if both are rising; second, when the
share price dips below the rising average but then soon bounces back through
it; and thirdly, when the share price falls towards the average and bounces
off it again.
I used charts long before I understood their chaos basis because I find they
reduce uncertainty and impose more discipline for timing purchases and
sales. I used a chart with 20- and 50-day moving averages, purchased from
Investment Research of Cambridge, to track progress of an investment in
Glaxo made in September 1990. I bought Glaxo on the fundamentals of its good
growth record and several new major drugs lining up to come to market this
decade.
During the following six months, I studied technical analysis more
thoroughly and realised I had bought my Glaxo holding before the chart
signalled a buy. During September the share price lay below the 50-day MA.
The buy signal came in October when the 20-day MA cut up through the 50-day
MA, known as a golden cross, and from late October both averages were
rising, one above the other, which is a very positive sign. The price rose
strongly during December, supported by both rising averages, as shown on the
chart.
Mid-January 1991 (as the Gulf war began and the markets turned bullish) gave
another buy signal as the price approached the 50-day MA and bounced firmly
up from it. This occured again in late May, late July and early November.
Each occasion gave a buy signal and on two of the signals, I added to my
existing investment. The Glaxo chart over this period is an excellent
example of a long-term uptrend. For FT-SE 100 shares, the 50-day MA often
gives the best signals.
The chart provided a sell signal six weeks after the shares peaked in
mid-January 1992, when for the first time in 17 months, the price fell below
the 50-day moving average, which had stopped rising.
Amid all the gloom about manufacturing in Britain, the pharmaceutical
industry is a great success story. 'Don't sell Glaxo' were the dying words
of a father to his daughter in an Anita Brookner novel. With its strong
fundamentals, it could pay to watch the catch for another buy signal.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why Edinburgh has placed its faith in
UK shares - Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE few prizes for being second and Edinburgh Investment Trust, the
second largest investment trust, sometimes misses out on the attention
accorded to its bigger rival, Foreign &amp; Colonial.
Edinburgh is one of the oldest investment trusts and it is named after the
city where it was founded in 1889, with a starting capital of Pounds
450,000. By the end of 1992, that figure had grown to more than Pounds 1bn.
Like Foreign &amp; Colonial, Edinburgh is classed as an international general
trust but you would not guess it from a glance at its current spread of
assets - 90 per cent in the UK.
The trust emphasises that this is not a policy change, but a strategy
change. 'At the moment the UK market is relatively speaking good value in
terms of capital and income growth,' says manager Ian Massie. Edinburgh is
quite ready to switch its assets into overseas markets if they appear more
attractive.
However, Edinburgh has consistently maintained a much higher weighting in
the UK market than its international rivals. This has not helped its
relative performance over the long term. According to figures from the
Association of Investment Trust Companies, Edinburgh was last (out of 14
trusts in the sector) in terms of share price performance over 10 years and
11th in terms of net asset value performance.
Other trusts with higher weightings in the US have benefited from both a
strong Wall Street and a rising dollar in recent years.
Ian Massie says the UK weighting has enabled the trust to deliver both a
higher yield (currently 4.2 per cent) than most of its rivals and higher
dividend growth - 16.5 per cent per annum over the past five years, compared
with a sector average of 15.4 per cent. And this week's base rate cut and
jump in London share prices makes the recent shift appear well timed.
The UK concentration means that the trust's 10 largest stocks are well known
names. They are: British Gas, Lloyds, Grand Met, Shell, BT, Abbey National,
NW Water, Smithkline Beecham, BAT, BTR. 'Because of the size of the trust,
we will tend to be invested in top 200 companies,' says Massie.
Outside the UK, the rest of the portfolio divides between the US (5 per
cent) Europe (2 per cent), Japan (2 per cent) and the Far East (1 per cent).
Edinburgh is also highly geared. Although its gross assets were over Pounds
1,066m on January 26, its net assets were Pounds 860m. At the moment, a
major chunk of those borrowings are invested in gilts, which because of the
current difference between long term and short term interest rates, gives a
boost to Edinburgh's income.
Ian Massie has worked for Dunedin since 1985 and took over as manager of
Edinburgh in 1989 from Grant Cochrane, who had managed the trust for 20
years. Massie trained as a chartered accountant and is a 36 year old
Aberdonian.
Massie stresses the importance of Dunedin's investment trust team -
consisting of Brian Tait, Graham McGeorge and himself - which manages four
of the five trusts in the stable. The Edinburgh-based Dunedin was formed in
1984 and now has Pounds 3.5bn of assets under management.
An investment group of senior managers decides on Dunedin's asset allocation
and that is reflected across the board.
Massie says the trust follows a value investing strategy and has an in-house
database which searches for undervalued stocks. However, he says the
criteria are too complex to be explained in the context of an article.
EIT's UK bias means that it has been fully Pepable since January 1 and is
the largest trust that can be held in Pep form. It has had some success in
attracting private investors; the number of Edinburgh shareholders rose 20
per cent in 1992 and is 40 per cent up on 1990.
In some ways, Edinburgh now sits rather oddly in the international sector,
since its overseas holdings are no larger than a UK income trust like
Lowland (featured last week). But Hamish Buchan, analyst at County NatWest
Wood Mac, says of the switch into the UK: 'It takes a bold move to make you
outperform' and if it succeeds, Edinburgh may get some of the attention it
has been denied in the past.
Key facts. The trust had net assets of Pounds 860m and a market
capitalisation of Pounds 739m, as of January 26. On that day, the nav per
share was 290.4p, the share price was 257p, a discount of 11.5 per cent. The
dividend yield is 4.2 per cent and the annual fee is 0.3 per cent.
Board. Ivor Guild, a partner of solicitors Shepherd &amp; Wedderburn, is
chairman of Edinburgh and has been since 1974. Other directors are: Grant
Cochrane, a former manager, is non-executive director of LASMO; Peter Dunn
also a director of Property Security Investment Trust; Sir David Nickson is
chairman of Clydesdale Bank; Sir Robert Smith is chairman of Alliance Trust;
Robin Young, a former director of Martin Currie, is also a director of
Securities Trust of Scotland. New appointments to the board are Sir Chips
Keswick, chairman of Hambros Bank and the Earl of Eglinton &amp; Winton,
chairman of Gerrard Vivian Grey.
Savings scheme and Pep details. The savings scheme has a minimum investment
of Pounds 30 per month or a lump sum of Pounds 250. There is no broker's
commission and the only cost is government stamp duty of 0.5 per cent. The
Pep plan has the same minimum investments. There is a Pounds 30 set-up
charge on the Pep and an annual fee of 0.5 per cent. Two free cash
withdrawals can be made from a plan each year.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Home repossessions fall from 1991 peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPOSSESSIONS fell from their 1991 peak of 75,540 to 68,540 at the end of
last year, according to figures released by the Council of Mortgage Lenders
this week. But the 9 per cent drop was accompanied by a sharp rise in the
number of those with mortgage arrears of at least six months.
At the end of last year, more than 350,000 households were six months behind
in their mortgage payments - an increase of 28 per cent on the 1991 total of
275,350.
Home-owners who were between six to 12 months behind increased to 205,010 at
the end of 1992 from 183,610 the previous year, while borrowers more than a
year in arrears rose from 91,740 to 147,040.
Mark Boleat, director-general of the CML, gave two main reasons for the
rise. When a property is repossessed, those with mortgage arrears fall out
of the statistics. And since lenders increasingly were accepting lower
monthly payments rather than repossessing, the arrears figures had
increased.
Boleat added that lower interest rates inflate the figures because of a
'statistical quirk.' Figures for monthly arrears are calculated by dividing
the total outstanding by the monthly payments. When interest rates fall, so
do the new monthly payments. The number of months of arrears for those
falling behind with their payments then increases automatically.
Shelter, the charity for the homeless, said that it did not agree with this
interpretation. Director Sheila McKechnie said: 'The problem of mortgage
debt is not diminishing, it is just shifting from repossessions to long-term
arrears. The crisis has been postponed, not solved.' Shelter is calling for
a mortgage benefit scheme similar to low-income housing benefit to those who
rent.
Jim Murgatroyd of Halifax, the largest lender, said it was 'illogical and
unfair' that those who owned homes should not be in the same position as
those who rent.
In the case of a joint mortgage, keeping up payments was not so much of a
difficulty if both parties became unemployed because they would be entitled
to social security. But if one was made redundant or had a loss of income,
it was more difficult for them to make regular payments.
The launch of schemes designed to contain the total number of repossessions
has had a limited effect compared with a policy of 'forbearance' by lenders.
Boleat estimates that only 1,000 homes have been saved as a result of
mortgage to rent schemes. But 10,000 households have been saved from
repossession because of the government's decision to pay the mortgage
interest element of income support directly to lenders.
While more than 60 per cent of repossessed households had a second mortgage,
the CML said, the second lender had been responsible for repossession in
only 1,000 cases. But the figures show that those with greater debts found
it harder to stave off repossession than others. Halifax said that situation
was changing. Those falling behind with mortgage payments now were more
likely to be doing so because of loss of income rather than multiple debts.
CML said that lenders would not increase repossessions once the market
improved.

<TEXT>
THE TREND of director selling, seen since the beginning of the year, has not
diminished. As the FT-SE 100 index moves ahead, directors are taking
profits.
TT Group's relative performance over the short and medium term has been
strong. Since the open offer at the beginning of the year at 167p, the
industrial group's share price has risen 50 per cent. Sales by John Newman
and Nicholas Shipp of 185,000 and 1m respectively still leave them with a
sizeable proportion of equity.
Three directors dealing at First Leisure raised more than Pounds 3.5m. Final
results for the leisure and recreation group were announced the previous
week and were slightly ahead of last year. The sales by Michael Payne and
Joseph Bollom almost halved their existing holdings but Lord Delfont, the
chairman, still retains a considerable number of shares.
Kevin McDonald, the chairman and managing director of Polypipe, has sold 2m
shares at 128p. He still holds more than 33m.
Directors at Caverdale, the motor distributor, have been bucking the trend
with sizeable purchases. The company is about to enter its closed period,
when directors are not allowed to deal, making this their last buying
opportunity for a while.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Tax victory prompts new guidelines -
Revenue moves to pay back tax on benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYEES WHO receive benefits from their employers should start examining
their tax returns with extra care as the implications of a concession from
the Inland Revenue sink in.
More than 130,000 people with in-house benefits can expect to receive
refunds as a result of a long-contested court battle which was concluded in
November.
The Revenue has already shown itself eager to hand back Pounds 550m a year
in tax on share dividends and bank interest in the last few weeks with a new
Pounds 2m advertising campaign. Now it is sheepishly admitting that it will
be paying out up to Pounds 30m to employees who have been over-taxed on
benefits.
Many who have been taxed through pay-as-you-earn or on their assessments
will be able to claim refunds as far back as the 1986-87 financial year.
The reason behind the change is an embarrassing and unexpected defeat for
the Revenue in the House of Lords late last year concerning John Hart, a
schoolteacher at Malvern College, and ten of his colleagues.
The Revenue had argued that Hart and his fellow teachers should pay tax as a
benefit on any reduced-rate private school fees for their children below the
average cost of tuition - the total costs divided by the number of pupils.
Hart argued - and won - on the grounds that he should only be taxed on any
amount they were paying below the marginal cost of tuition - the additional
cost of teaching one extra person, to include items such as books, laundry
and food.
After several weeks to think through the implications of the Law Lords'
decision, the Revenue has now issued guidance on the ruling.
The groups which are likely to be affected are employees receiving goods and
services provided by their employers free or at a discount from within their
business; and those able to use business assets partly for private use.
The ruling will have no effect on many benefits, including a number covered
by separate legislation such as company cars, beneficial loans and living
accommodation.
The largest of these groups are employees of British Rail and London
Transport, which are offered concessionary travel. These are so large that
the Revenue is making special arrangements, and employees need not contact
their tax office directly.
Others likely to be affected - aside from concessionary tuition fees for
private school teachers - include employees of travel companies, airlines
and ferry companies who may have been taxed based on the average rather than
marginal cost.
The Revenue has laid down some guidelines on marginal cost. It says it
accepts that there is no, or negligible, cost for rail or bus employees on
terms which do not displace fare-paying passengers.
There will equally be no tax on goods sold at a discount at least at the
wholesale price; teachers paying at least 15 per cent of a school's normal
fees; and professional services which do not require additional employees or
partners.
Some fixed costs on the private use of assets - such as the road tax for a
fitter's van - will no longer be taken into account as part of the
assessment of taxable benefit.
On mobile phones, the Revenue states that the cash equivalent of the benefit
is Pounds 200. It is reduced to nil if the employee does not use the phone
for private use, or makes good the full cost of any private use.
As a result of the House of Lords judgment, it has determined that the
employee should not have to pay a proportion of the standing charges of the
phone, such as line rental.
Tax practitioners are busy considering the implications of Pepper vs Hart on
behalf of their own clients. Ms Leslie Ferrar of KPMG Peat Marwick, adds the
possibility of the annual subscription rate on corporate credit cards and
the insurance premiums on rental vans as among the other benefits which may
now be subject to less tax by employees.
The Revenue says that anyone claiming a refund should apply to their local
tax office, and will be able to process claims more quickly if taxpayers
bring their national insurance number and details of the years in which they
paid tax on in-house benefits.
Those expecting this new taxing regime on benefits to remain unchallenged in
the future should not be too optimistic. The Revenue has a habit of
influencing ministers to change the law when it is defeated in court.

FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: A tax cold-shoulder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL pensions holders face a less friendly tax environment from April 6.
But just how much less friendly depends on how old you are, how much you
earn, and whether you are male or female.
From April, the rebate on National Insurance contributions for those who
contract out of the state earnings related pension scheme (SERPS) is to be
4.8 per cent of earnings between the lower and upper earnings limits, down
from 5.8 per cent currently available. Moreover, the two per cent additional
rebate is to be eliminated and replaced by a one per cent tax rebate only
for personal pension holders aged 30 and over.
The government has now decided that members of so-called contracted out
money purchase schemes, some of which are organised by employers, shall not
be eligible for the one per cent additional rebate.
The effect of the changes means that those who have contracted out of
personal pensions will now find it advantageous to opt back in even earlier
than had been planned. And for some young people on low salaries,
contracting out is also much less attractive.
The difficulty is that there are wide differences of view over when it it is
worthwhile to opt back into SERPS. For instance, Legal and General says that
those who already have personal pensions can still obtain tax advantages up
to the ages of 45 and 40 respectively because they have already paid the
up-front costs associated with them. However, Clay and Partners, consulting
actuaries, puts the ages at 50 for men and 42 for women.
The Department of Social Security became concerned that individuals making
personal pension provision should be properly informed about the tax
changes. It asked the self-regulatory bodies which oversee those who sell
personal pensions to make sure clients were advised properly. Last week,
Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life industry, became the first SRO
to issue guidance for agents.

DOW CHEMICAL, the second-biggest US chemicals group, yesterday reported a
loss of Dollars 250m, or 92 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1992,
compared with a loss of Dollars 94m in the corresponding period of 1991.
The deficit, which was expected, occurred because of a Dollars 433m charge
for plant shutdowns and staff reductions.
Mr Frank Popoff, chairman, described the company's results as
'disappointing', although he stressed that progress had been made in
restoring US margins.
The US improvement, however, was more than offset by deteriorating business
conditions in Europe, a problem faced by several big US chemicals groups.
Revenues in the fourth quarter of last year were Dollars 4.72bn, up slightly
from Dollars 4.56bn last time.
Revenues for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 18.97bn, against Dollars 18.81bn
in 1991.
Dow said its operating income declined by 23 per cent in 1992 to Dollars
1.3bn, mainly because of a drop in prices.
For the year to end-December 1992, Dow suffered a net loss of Dollars 496m,
or Dollars 1.83, against a net profit of Dollars 935m in 1991.
The loss, however, was due to a Dollars 765m non-cash charge related to
changes in accountancy standards.
The chemicals and performance products division had Dollars 279m of
operating income in 1992, unchanged on 1991, including the impact of special
charges. Plastics saw an 80 per cent decline in 1992 operating income, but
the figure was not disclosed. The energy business suffered a Dollars 179m
loss in 1992, compared with a loss of Dollars 230m in 1991.
The consumer specialties business had 13 per cent better operating income of
Dollars 1.1bn, representing 84 per cent of the entire group's 1992 operating
profit.
Dow's share price was Dollars  3/4 lower to close at Dollars 52 5/8 .

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Capital Cities/ABC up 34%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL CITIES/ABC, the US television and newspapers group, yesterday turned
in a fourth-quarter 1992 net profit of Dollars 137.9m, or Dollars 8.38 a
share, an improvement of 34 per cent year-on-year.
The results, which included a moderate rise in revenues at the ABC
Television network, were struck on total revenues of Dollars 1.64bn, some 5
per cent better than in the same quarter of 1991.
For the year to end-December 1992, Capital Cities/ABC earned Dollars 389.3m
before taking special charges for changes in accounting standards, up from
Dollars 374.7m before charges in 1991. After an accountancy-related
provision of Dollars 143.2m, the group's net income for 1992 fell to Dollars
246.1m, against a net of Dollars 343.5m the previous year.
Operating income for the year was Dollars 721.8m, down from Dollars 761m in
1991.
Revenues for 1992 were Dollars 5.34bn, down slightly from Dollars 5.38bn in
1991. Net revenues for ABC Television were slightly lower, primarily because
of the absence of 1991 added revenues from special-event sports programming.
Although the group does not state operating profits for ABC Television, it
is understood these came to just below Dollars 100m for 1992, against an
estimated Dollars 135m the previous year.
The decline is believed to be related to a series of internally recorded
special charges caused by buy-outs being offered to some executives and
other cost-cutting measures.
On Wall Street, the Capital Cities/ABC share price closed Dollars 2 3/4
higher at Dollars 481.

392.6m in fourth quarter

COCA-COLA, the Atlanta-based soft drinks company, yesterday reported a 9.5
per cent advance in fourth-quarter profits after tax, to Dollars 392.6m, on
sales 12.7 per cent higher at Dollars 3.24bn. With accounting-related
charges stripped out, the rise would have been 11.8 to Dollars 400.6m.
The group's full-year figures are muddied by the effects of the change in
accounting methods for non-pension retirement benefits. Before these items,
net profits showed a 17.8 per cent improvement, at Dollars 1.91bn. After the
accounting-related charge, the advance is reduced to 2.9 per cent, leaving
net profits at Dollars 1.66bn. Sales for the full year were 13 per cent
higher at Dollars 13.1bn.
Coca-Cola said that the fourth-quarter volume growth helped the final
quarter's figures. 'It augers well for 1993 that we ended 1992 with such
momentum,' commented Mr Roberto Goizueta, chairman.
Coca-Cola said that operating profits from its soft drinks operations within
the US advanced 9 per cent last year. Unit case volume sold to retail
bottle/can and fountain customers grew 2 per cent, and gallon shipments of
concentrates and syrups advanced by a similar amount.
On the international side, soft drink operating profit was up by 18 per
cent. Unit case volume sold to retail customers increased by 4 per cent, and
gallon shipments of concentrates and syrups grew by 3 per cent.

RHONE-Poulenc Rorer, the separately stock market listed pharmaceuticals
division of Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, yesterday reported a
31 per cent increase in net profits for last year.
The Franco-American group made Dollars 428m last year on sales of Dollars
4.1bn, up from net profits of Dollars 326m on sales of Dollars 3.8bn. Sales
rose by an underlying 8.4 per cent, stripping out currency changes and asset
sales, while earnings per share rose from Dollars 2.3 to Dollars 3.1.
Mr Robert Cawthorn, group chairman, said earnings growth was faster than the
pharmaceuticals industry average.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer had also increased spending on research and development.
Operating profits increased from Dollars 558m to Dollars 675m, while capital
gains from asset sales fell to Dollars 23m from Dollars 95m.
CAISSE Nationale de Credit Agricole has increased its stake in Banco
Ambrosiana Veneto to 15.76 per cent, buying a 2.72 per cent stake from
Gemina for FFr320m, Reuter reports from Paris.

FT  29 JAN 93 / US insurer to take space at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIGNA, one of the largest US insurance companies, is to transfer part of its
London operations to the headquarters of Lloyd's.
The move underlines growing links between Lloyd's syndicates and insurance
companies - Cigna is the sixth company to rent space at the market's
headquarters in recent weeks.
Cigna's arrival was welcomed by Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, as
'an encouraging sign after our recent difficulties'.
Mr Nick Phillips, general manager of property at Lloyd's, hopes Cigna's
decision might trigger the entry of between 25 and 30 other companies that
are discussing possible moves.
Lloyd's agreed last year to seek corporate capital to participate in
syndicates alongside some 20,000 Names - the individuals who provide its
capital. A number of Lloyd's agencies are examining ways of persuading
institutional investors to back the market's business.
Cigna is understood to have agreed to occupy 400 sq ft at Lloyd's, at a cost
of about Pounds 50,000 per year. It will specialise in insuring casualty and
liability business at Lloyd's.
Mr Alan May, senior vice-president of Cigna, said the Lloyd's building was
popular with brokers and the company hoped to win more business as a result
of moving there.
In a separate development Syndicate Underwriting Management, an insurance
agency owned by the Corporation of Lloyd's, announced yesterday that it has
been appointed to manage the 'run-off' - liquidation - of six syndicates
that have gone out of business over the last 18 months.
Four of the six syndicates involved - 367, 411, 1097 and 1152 - were
formerly administered by the Secretan agency, which ceased trading at the
end of 1991. The other two - 785 and 786 - were formerly managed by Michael
Moss Underwriting Agency. All the syndicates were overwhelmed by claims from
US asbestosis and pollution awards.
Syndicate Underwriting Management was set up in 1987 by the corporation,
which administers and regulates the Lloyd's market, to manage 74 syndicates
formerly managed by the PCW, WMD and Richard Beckett agencies. Turnover is
expected to be at least Pounds 15m this year, compared with Pounds 5.5m in
1992.

earnings for year

<TEXT>
MR PIERRE Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications
and engineering group, yesterday estimated that last year's net profit rose
by between 12 per cent and 15 per cent, but that earnings would probably be
flat this year, writes William Dawkins in Paris.
This indicates that profits rose to at least FFr7bn (Dollars 1.29bn) in 1992
from FFr6.2bn in 1991. It also appears to back up recent warnings from
analysts that profit margins in the telecommunications equipment market,
from which Alcatel Alsthom derives more than half its profits, could shrink
in the next few years.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's biggest private-sector company, yesterday confirmed its
profits had fallen sharply in 1992 and described the year ahead as remaining
'critical'.
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, said in a letter to shareholders that the
group's industrial activities, which account for more than 80 per cent of
its sales, had remained in profit at the operating level. However, margins
are believed to have fallen to about 0.2 per cent of sales against 1.1 per
cent in 1991.
The group's key car business, hit by rising competition and recession, is
believed to have made a loss, although no official figures are available. In
a summary of the group's problems, Mr Agnelli refered to a cocktail of
recession, monetary turmoil, high interest rates and Italy's domestic
economic problems.
Group pre-tax profits are likely to fall to around L800bn (Dollars 542m)
against L1,690bn in 1991. The figure has been boosted by substantial
extraordinary earnings, the biggest of which is a L700bn contribution from
the sale of Fiat's 25 per cent stake in Alcatel Italia, the telecoms group
formed largely from its former Telettra subsidiary. Official profits figures
 -and news of the dividend - will not be released until May.
The group's continuing commitment to investment and research and development
 -which reached a record 14 per cent of sales last year - has had a heavy
impact. Fiat's net financial position worsened to a deficit of L3,800bn at
the end of last year, compared with a L270bn deficit at the end of 1991 and
L2,510bn at end-June 1992.
Group turnover increased 4.6 per cent to L59,100bn thanks to the first
full-year's contribution from the Ford New Holland tractors and heavy trucks
business. On the cars side, sales fell to L26,886bn from L27,506bn,
reflecting the 114,700 drop in unit sales and the reduction of margins.

<TEXT>
MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software company, will make its
European pricing more consistent by lowering the prices of some of its PC
applications programs in certain countries.
The price changes 'will have no material effect on overall sales revenues,'
said Mr Bernard Vergnes, president of Microsoft Europe. However, prices will
fall by 10 to 21 per cent in France, Germany and the Benelux region.
Microsoft also announced a distribution and software licensing programme
aimed at boosting its sales to large multinational companies and
organisations.
Microsoft is setting the stage for an ambitious effort to move beyond its
stronghold in the PC software market. It is expected to introduce a new
program, Windows NT, that will control the functions of entire networks of
computers.
Sun Microsystems, the US computer workstation manufacturer, reported a steep
decline in second quarter earnings as shortages of a new microprocessor chip
limited sales of the highest performance version of its new product line.
Net income was Dollars 34.3m, or 33 cents a share, down 28 per cent from
Dollars 47.4m, or 47 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues rose to
Dollars 1.05bn from Dollars 909m.
Sun said the chip supply problem had eased, enabling it to ship the new high
performance workstation in greater volume.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Key Recommendations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An extra market of 19m tonnes a year for domestic deep-mined coal to be
created from April, mainly by postponing liberalisation of the electricity
market and enabling power companies to commit themselves to more long-term
contracts.
The extra output to be subsidised for five years to enable British Coal to
sell it at world prices. Estimated first-year cost is Pounds 120m.
Additional financial help for installation of clean coal technology.
Subsidy to be paid for either by diverting part of nuclear levy to coal or
by direct Treasury grant. There would be no increase in consumer electricity
charges as a result.
Options to generate further increase in market for domestic coal to be
considered. These to include cutting open-cast output from 18m tonnes to 10m
tonnes per year by imposing a
moratorium on new licences; measures to make imported French electricity
less competitive; requiring power stations burning orimulsion to fit flue
gas desulphurisation equipment, impairing the fuel's competitiveness;
challenging rules in the electricity wholesale market which make gas-fired
stations more likely to be fully used than coal plants.
Creating a new licensing authority.
Establishing an Energy Commission modelled on the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
All proposed pit closures to be referred to modified colliery review
procedure. In theory this would rule out any pit closure for nine months but
in practice is unlikely to do so.
Pits with no long-term prospects to be stripped of easily accessible
reserves or turned over to private licence-holders.

<TEXT>
BRITISH ALCAN, the aluminium smelter based in north-east England and British
Coal's largest manufacturing customer, has renewed supply arrangements for
1.2m tonnes of coal a year from Ellington colliery, Northumberland, Chris
Tighe writes.
British Coal, which sells about 6m tonnes a year in the industrial market,
has also announced further orders worth Pounds 40m from industrial companies
for almost 1m tonnes of deep-mined and opencast coal. They include an order
for 500,000 tonnes over three years from Fife-based papermaker Tullis
Russell, a new customer. There is also a new contract from Scottish Power
for 200,000 tonnes.
Ellington, which employs 1,600 people, is the only one of the north-east's
five remaining collieries not earmarked for closure in the October 1992 list
of 31 pits. It was ranked bottom, however, among the remaining 19
collieries.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWMONT Mining, a leading gold-producer based in Denver, Colorado, said
lower gold prices weakened its fourth-quarter results, but it still showed a
profit, writes Laurie Morse.
Newmont reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 3.9m, or 3 cents a
share, down from Dollars 22.7m, or 33 cents, in the corresponding period a
year ago. Consolidated fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 140.9m, compared
with Dollars 155.9m in 1991.
For the year, Newmont reported earnings, before a special accounting charge,
of Dollars 90.6m, or Dollars 1.30, down from Dollars 94.3m, or Dollars 1.39,
in 1991. The company said the earnings decline was directly related to a
Dollars 12-per-ounce fall in the average price it received for gold in 1992.
Newmont had consolidated annual sales of Dollars 613.2m, down from Dollars

<TEXT>
FORD, the US carmaker, exported vehicles and components from its UK
operations worth about Pounds 2.2bn last year, virtually unchanged from
1991, Kevin Done writes.
It shipped 159,000 vehicles from its Dagenham, Halewood and Southampton
assembly plants, and 770,000 engines from its Bridgend and Dagenham plants.
Ford also exported about 17 per cent of its output from its plant at
Halewood, Merseyside, and exported more than 50 per of its Fiesta output
from its Dagenham, London, plant.
Exports of light commercial vehicles rose to 82,654 from 63,900 a year
earlier. About 21,000 Transit vans, or 37 per cent of output, were exported
from the Southampton plant.

FT  29 JAN 93 / World Trade News: New small car is unveiled today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors Europe unveils today its new generation small car, the
Opel/Vauxhall Corsa pictured below, which has been developed at a cost of
around DM1.5bn (Pounds 599m), writes Kevin Done.
GM (Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK) is aiming to increase
significantly its share of the market for small cars in west Europe with the
launch of the new Corsa against rivals such as the Ford Fiesta, Fiat Uno,
Renault Clio and Peugeot 106.
GM has reduced the development time for the Corsa to only 36 months, its
fastest new model development programme in Europe.
Small cars in the Corsa/Fiesta class account for around 28 per cent of all
new car sales in west Europe. GM will build the Corsa at its plant at
Zaragoza, Spain and at its new DM1bn assembly plant at Eisenach in eastern
Germany which was opened last autumn.
GM has also developed for the first time in this market segment a
purpose-built high-roof van to challenge similar light commercial vehicles
such as the Renault Express, the Fiat Fiorino, and the Ford Courier.
The Corsa van will be produced at GM's assembly plant at Azambuja in
Portugal.

FT  29 JAN 93 / World Trade News: GM shifts production from Finland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors Europe has transferred all production of its Opel/Vauxhall
cars in Finland to Germany, triggering a complex legal battle with its
Finnish partner Valmet, the majority state-owned paper machinery and
engineering group.
GM has moved production of its Opel/Vauxhall Calibra coupe from Valmet's
plant at Uusikaupunki to one of its main German plants at Russelsheim, near
Frankfurt.
The US carmaker, which is in second place in the west European new car
market, has been forced to introduce short-time working at the Russelsheim
plant during the first three months of this year in the face of weakening
new car sales in west Europe.
It has moved the Finnish assembly to Germany to improve capacity utilisation
at the German plant and to avoid the added cost penalties of production in
Finland.
Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, said the company incurred a cost
penalty of around FM5,000 (Pounds 600) per car for Calibras produced in
Finland compared with assembly of the same car in Germany.
GM had shipped many of the components to Finland from its plants in Germany,
incurring substantial transport costs.
In a separate move to cut production costs in Europe, GM is also planning to
reduce output at its Bochum plant in Germany, by moving from three-shift to
two-shift working. The company has already introduced short-time working at
its Antwerp, Belgium and Luton, UK assembly plants.
The GM action in Finland is a significant blow to the loss-making Valmet
group, which produced 34,556 Opel/Vauxhall cars in 1992 and 21,532 in 1991,
but which now faces the complete loss of the Opel business in 1993.
Valmet is left only with the assembly of the Saab 900 convertible of which
it will produce 7,000-8,000 this year compared with 10,800 in 1992. Saab
Automobile is owned equally by GM and Saab-Scania of Sweden.
Valmet is seeking to resolve the dispute with GM under Finnish arbitration
rules, but GM is challenging the legality of this move.
It is expected to move soon to invoke arbitration under the rules of the UN
Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), as stipulated in the 1990
Calibra assembly agreement.
Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, signed an agreement with Saab-Valmet, now
a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of Valmet, in June 1990 for the assembly of
the Calibra in Finland at a time when GM needed extra capacity in west
Europe with new car demand at a record level.
The assembly agreement with Valmet is not due to expire until the end of
1996. Under the terms of the deal, GM believes that it is free to decide the
volume of cars to be assembled in Finland each year.
This volume can be set at zero, as there are no volume guarantees, but only
a contractually agreed price per unit.

FT  29 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) Survey of Personal Equity Plans (19): 'Tax-free'
isn't always as good as it sounds - Charges / But new structures can benefit
those who are able to invest a large sum for the long term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (Published 30th January 1993) appended to this article.
EVER SINCE personal equity plans were introduced in 1987, charges have
proved a booby-trap for the unwary investor. All too often, charges can
outweigh the tax advantages of a Pep, especially for the basic-rate payer.
But the industry has woken up to the problem this year. A range of new
charging structures have been introduced, with most designed to reward
long-term investors or those who can make the maximum annual contribution of
Pounds 6,000. And a few managers have pared charges to the bone, in a manner
which should reward all investors.
The problem for most Pep investors is that the 'tax-free' label is less
promising than it sounds. Very few people pay capital gains tax - only
100,000 in 1991. So the income tax exemption is the important factor for
most investors.
However, the dividend yield on many Peps may well be only 4 to 5 per cent,
so that a basic-rate taxpayer will only save 1 per cent in tax. If the Pep
manager imposes an initial charge of 5 per cent, then it will be around five
years before the investor reclaims the charges in tax savings. And on some
plans, the combination of low yields and additional charges may push the
break-even point out to decades away. This can be particularly true on some
managed Peps, where charges tend to be higher.
What altered the calculations was the chancellor's decision, in the 1992
Budget, to allow all EC-based unit and investment trusts to qualify for the
full Pounds 6,000 annual Pep limit. That created a battle to seize the
biggest slice of the potentially lucrative market.
Investors were starting to notice the impact of charges, in any case. Some
advisers were recommending clients to get the full benefit of a Pep by
adding the charges to their Pounds 6,000 investment. Clients were
accordingly writing out a cheque for Pounds 6,400 or so - which made the
charges much more noticeable than the traditional system of 'hiding' the
costs within the bid-offer spread.
So, to meet the new 'value-for-money' era, a range of charging systems is
now in place:
Exit fees: Under this system, the manager reduces the initial charge but
imposes a fee (on a sliding scale) for those who want to sell their
investments in the early years. The trend was started by Fidelity, which cut
its initial Pep charge from 5.25 per cent to 2 per cent, while imposing an
exit fee of 3 per cent in the first year, declining steadily to zero after
three years.
Scottish Amicable replaced its 5 per cent initial charge with a flat fee of
Pounds 45 plus VAT, and imposed withdrawal charges for those who sell in the
first five years.
It seems a good idea to design Peps to encourage long-term holders, because
that is the essence of equity investment. But investors need to watch the
impact of all charges. For example, Scottish Amicable imposed an annual Pep
fee of 0.875 per cent on top of its annual management fee; and, over a long
period, a high annual charge will outweigh the benefit of a lower initial
charge.
Flat fees: Managers do face administrative costs in setting up a Pep, but
those costs are the same, whether the investor's contributions are large or
small. A flat initial fee can help the management group to recoup its costs
while at the same time rewarding those who invest the maximum amount.
Take Martin Currie's flat-fee Pep, based on four of its investment trusts.
The plan has an initial fee of Pounds 50 plus annual membership of Pounds
60. To someone investing Pounds 2,000 (the minimum allowed by Martin
Currie), those fees would represent a charge of 5.5 per cent in the first
year and 3 per cent in subsequent years, more than enough to wipe out any
tax benefits. However, those investing the full Pounds 6,000 would pay only
1.83 per cent in the first year, and 1 per cent in subsequent years - and
would very quickly earn back the fees in tax benefits.
Low-load and no-load Peps. Some managers have decided to cut initial charges
drastically, or eliminate them altogether. Murray Johnstone has an initial
charge of just 1 per cent on its unit trust Pep (which includes the charge
on the trust itself), compared with the 5 to 6 per cent charged by most unit
trusts.
Gartmore's UK index fund, which tracks the FT-A All-Share Index, has no
initial charge and a 0.5 per cent annual charge. The fund is available in
Pep form through broker WI Carr for an initial fee of Pounds 30 plus VAT,
around 0.6 per cent for a full Pounds 6,000 investment.
Cutting the initial charge does not, alas, eliminate the bid-offer spread.
It still costs money for the manager to buy and sell the underlying shares,
and those expenses are passed on to the investor. One way of looking at this
is to work out the immediate realisable value of your Pep: what you would
get back if you sold your investment immediately.
On the Murray Johnstone Pep, the immediate realisable value is between 95
and 98 per cent; on other Peps, it could be as low as 92 per cent.
It is unlikely that the whole of the Pep industry will change to the new
charging structures. The old system of front-end charging enables fund
management groups to reward financial advisers for selling the products.
Some fund managers are still trying to pay commission, using the new
charging systems, but it is more difficult, and possibly makes the entire
exercise unprofitable.
Although there are many good advisers, who will recommend a Pep regardless
of whether there is a commission available - or who charge a fee - the
absence of commission will inevitably limit sales prospects.
In any case, some fund management groups adhere firmly to the line that
performance matters far more than charges over the long term.
They are right, of course. The problem is that future performance is, by
definition, unknown, whereas charges are easily measured. By choosing a
low-charging Pep, the investor is tilting the odds in his or her favour.
CORRECTION
THE END OF the tax year often leads to special offers from financial groups.
Scottish Equitable* is offering to waive its fixed administration fee
(Pounds 45 plus VAT) for those who buy its Premium personal equity plan
between February 1 and April 30.
The Premium Pep is linked to six unit trusts. There is no initial charge on
these, which means investors buy units at the 'creation' price, which is
well below the offer price. There is still a bid-offer spread of around 1
per cent, but this reflects Scottish Equitable's costs in buying and selling
the shares the trusts own.
Scottish Equitable does, however, impose an annual Pep charge of 0.875 per
cent (plus VAT) on top of the normal yearly unit trust management charge of
1 per cent or so. And those who want to sell their Pep holdings will face
exit charges within the first five years.
Martin Currie, the Edinburgh-based fund management group, is also offering a
2 per cent discount on Pep investments into its range of nine unit trusts
for those who apply by March 26.
*On p19 of the Quarterly Review, published today, I attribute this plan
incorrectly to Scottish Amicable. My apologies for this error.

FT  29 JAN 93 / MPs favour turning the tide of coal imports: The trade and
industry committee's proposals for making mining competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT growth in coal imports will be rapidly reversed under proposals to be
made by the Commons trade and industry committee. The recommendations are
likely to be adopted at least in part in the government's white paper on
energy.
The electricity generators, which until last October were preparing for
further strong import growth, have begun to tell overseas suppliers to
expect cuts in demand and are not renewing contracts.
The likelihood is that import facilities that National Power and PowerGen
have built up in the past two years at a cost of more than Pounds 150m will,
in the near future at least, be significantly under-used.
Cutting imports is by no means a simple option for the government. Last year
the UK imported about 20m tonnes of coal, not all of which could be replaced
by UK coal. About 8m, brought in by British Steel, is coking coal of a type
not available in Britain. Other large companies import directly and would
want to keep a toe in the international market.
One opening would be provided if British Coal could prove its claim that
some foreign coal is dumped on the European market. But neither the European
Commission nor the government has shown much enthusiasm for this.
British Coal's chances of competing are also hindered by the quality of its
output. One company that buys coal from Colombia says the sulphur content is
less than half of most British coal.
But the main problem is price. The UK suffers because of the age of its
industry, which means that most coal near the surface has already been
extracted. Cheaper opencast mines are plentiful in countries such as
Colombia, the US and Australia, helping them to deliver to UK ports for
between Pounds 1 and Pounds 1.20 a gigajoule.
In tentative contracts with generators, drawn up before the pit closures
announcement, British Coal was to charge Pounds 1.51 a gigajoule for the 40m
tonnes envisaged in the year from April 1993, falling to Pounds 1.33 by the
end of the five-year contracts. Most analysts and British Coal expect
production costs will be considerably lower by then.
In the meantime import prices, although currently falling, are expected to
rise. This is partly because of an increase in shipping and insurance rates
and partly because the US is likely to want more low-sulphur coal, currently
exported in large quantities, for its domestic market.
All this means that UK coal could be internationally competitive in Britain
at least by the mid to late 1990s. The problem is what to do before then.
The Commons committee's answer is to provide a subsidy for 19m tonnes, some
of it to replace imports. The money would come from either the nuclear levy
or the taxpayer. The idea still faces opposition from the cabinet and may
yet be challenged by other coal-producing countries citing protectionism.
But as options narrow, some sort of financial support looks increasingly
likely.

   COLOGNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLOCKNER-Humboldt-Deutz, the German diesel engine and industrial plant
manufacturer, yesterday announced plans for a substantial capital increase
through a one-for-two rights issue.
The company plans to raise its capital to DM477m (Dollars 318m), an increase
of DM159m, with the sale of an additional 3.18m shares.
The issue price will only be fixed on March 1.
The issue will be underwritten by a banking consortium, headed by Deutsche
Bank, which is a 41 per cent shareholder.
Mr Werner Kirchgasser, the chief executive, said the capital issue had long
been planned to underpin the drastic restructuring programme under way at
KHD, including a new DM600m diesel engine plant in the Porz district of
Cologne.
Although the company has not paid a dividend since 1986, he forecast a good
take-up of the shares, which would be competitively priced.
He dismissed market speculation that a recent boost in the company's share
price was the result of an unidentified potential takeover.
The company would expect any such buyer first to make an approach for a
friendly takeover, he said, and no such approach had been received. The
capital issue would make any such move in the future more difficult.
Mr Kirchgasser said that the company's operating profit for 1992 would be
'clearly positive' on the basis of a 10 per cent drop in turnover on 1991.
The KHD group had managed to hold its own during the past year, against the
background of a depressed world economy: orders were slightly up at DM3.7bn.
The best performance in the group came from the industrial plant division,
including cement plants, raw material processing plants, and sewage
treatment plants: turnover was up 10 per cent, and orders up 32 per cent on
1991.

<TEXT>
MR JEAN-MARC Vernes, the French financier, yesterday announced he had
withdrawn from negotiations with Nestle, the Swiss food group, to buy part
of the Vichy mineral water business.
Nestle was last summer instructed by the European Commission to sell a
number of the mineral water brands, including Vichy and Saint Yorre, that it
had acquired in its bruising bid battle for Perrier, one of France's
best-known water companies.
Mr Vernes, chairman of the Vernes bank and the SCI investment concern, had
been discussing the possible purchase of some of the brands under the Vichy
umbrella, together with Mr Raul Gardini, the Italian businessman who is
involved with SCI.
However Mr Vernes said in an interview with La Tribune Desfosses, the French
financial newspaper, that he had halted the negotiations.
He also indicated that he might be interested in investing in some of the
state-controlled companies which may be privatised after the March
legislative elections.
Nestle said yesterday it was continuing discussions with other parties over
the sale of Vichy and Saint Yorre, although it stressed the talks were still
at a preliminary stage.

Mr Robert Cawthorn, group chairman, said earnings growth was faster than the
pharmaceuticals industry average.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer had also increased spending on research and development.
Operating profits increased from Dollars 558m to Dollars 675m, while capital
gains from asset sales fell to Dollars 23m from Dollars 95m.

AIR France, the state-controlled French airline, plans to join forces in the
tour operation business with Havas, the French media and leisure group, and
TUI, the German travel company.
The merged company, called Jet Tours, will be one of the largest tour

It will combine SOTAIR, the tour operator currently controlled by Air France

Havas and TUI.
Once the merger, still subject to approval by the three companies'
administrative boards and workers' committees, is completed Jet Tours will
have an annual turnover of FFr3bn (Dollars 566m) and 700,000 clients. Air
France will be the majority shareholder, leaving Havas and TUI each with 20
per cent.
Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, said the new company would have
sufficient critical mass to 'be able to fight more effectively against the
big European tour groups'.
Air France, and the two other shareholders, hope to cut administrative costs
after the merger and also to use Jet Tours' size to secure better terms from
suppliers.
SOTAIR, France's third-largest tour operator, specialises in long-haul
destinations, and SFTA, number five in the French market, in medium-haul
tours. They already co-operate in certain areas, notably in Atoll, the
reservation service that they own jointly.
The merger comes at a time when European tour operators are under intense
pressure because of the impact of the economic slowdown and exchange rate
fluctuations on the holiday industry.

FT  29 JAN 93 / French Socialists reconciled to poll disaster: After the
long years of power, President Mitterrand's party knows its time is up - The
election prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE talk these days at the Rue Solferino headquarters of France's ruling
Socialists is of rebuilding the party - but after, not before, the
parliamentary elections in March.
For there, as in the rest of the country, it is assumed that in seven weeks'
time the Socialists will take their worst electoral hammering in nearly 20
years. Certainly, Mr Laurent Fabius, the Socialists' secretary-general, has
again this week complained at the widespread expectation of a right-wing
landslide.
But Mr Christian Pierret, the Socialists' campaign co-ordinator, sets his
sights low when he says he hopes that 'by the end of the campaign we will
reach 23-24 per cent in the opinion polls'. A couple of extra percentage
points in the polls would make all the difference, he says. If in March the
Socialists won only the 19-20 per cent of the vote which most polls now give
them, the number of their deputies would sink from 270 to 80-90. But 23-24
per cent could, under the majority voting system, translate into 130-150
seats. This, says Mr Pierret, 'could be considered a victory - or at least
an honourable defeat'.
The modesty of Socialists' hopes and the magnitude of their fears are not
surprising, given their disarray. Mrs Marie-Noelle Lienemann can say
publicly the party's 'time is over' and still keep her job as junior housing
minister. Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the left-wing opponent of Maastricht,
can run a slate of 30 dissident Socialist candidates (one of them against Mr
Roland Dumas, the foreign minister) and still stay on the party's national
committee.
This is tolerance born of weakness after the battering which the Socialists
have taken during a decade in power. Even their pre-1986 stint in government
continues to haunt them. Mr Fabius, who was prime minister in 1984-86, and
two ex-health ministers are to go before a parliamentary impeachment
procedure to defend themselves against charges of negligence in allowing
Aids-contaminated blood to be given to haemophiliacs.
More widely damaging are the charges of taking illegal (because hidden)
corporate cash, on which Mr Henri Emmanuelli, the National Assembly
president and ex-Socialist treasurer, has been indicted. In organising a
national redistribution of kickbacks on public contracts, the Socialists may
just have been doing more openly what all French parties have long done in a
less organised way. But the effect was worse, says Mr Pierret, because 'we
used to be regarded as the party of the politically pure'.
President Francois Mitterrand went too far for his own party in proposing
last autumn a total ban on companies funding political parties. The
Socialists joined other parties in passing a law simply requiring greater
disclosure of corporate cash.
Yet the president is himself a liability to his fellow Socialists. With a 26
per cent approval rating in last weekend's IFOP poll, his popularity is back
down to where it was before the Maastricht referendum. Nor have president
and prime minister been pulling smoothly in harness. Within a fortnight of
Mr Mitterrand's New Year message, which sent the Socialists into battle
under the slogan of defending social policy gains, Prime Minister Pierre
Beregovoy was suggesting that one solution for France's financially-strapped
state pension scheme would be to make people work longer before qualifying
for retirement pay.
The Socialist governments of 1981-86 saw through social reforms including a
lower retirement age and reduced working hours. Mr Pierret regrets they did
not do more in the good years of the late 1980s: 'Now we are regarded as
serious managers of the system, not as reformers.'
On the economy, the government has chalked up a number of achievements in
the last year, getting inflation down to a 36-year low of 2 per cent and
producing a FFr30bn (Dollars 5.55bn) trade surplus. But part of the price of
success is a jobless total of nearly 3m. This weighs heavily on Socialist
shoulders.
In such a period of decline, perhaps inevitable after so long in power, the
Socialists' structural flaws become more evident. One of the weaknesses is
that, unlike social democratic parties in the rest of Europe, the party has
no natural constituency within the trade unions. It has also let slip from
its grasp the ecological movement, which is progressing far faster in France
than elsewhere in Europe.
A CAF opinion poll yesterday put Generation Ecologique, together with the
Greens, at 19 per cent, ahead of the Socialists with 17.5 per cent.
Virtually the only consolation on the Rue Solferino is the knowledge that
France's right is as sharply divided as the Socialists. Playing on the
opposition's divisions is the Socialists' best, maybe only, gambit.

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: BCE profits record for Canada
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group and parent of Northern
Telecom, posted record profit of CDollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.09bn), or
CDollars 4.21 a share, for 1992, in spite of the recession and rising
long-distance competition.
The profit is the highest posted by a Canadian company. Last year, BCE
acquired 20 per cent of the UK's Mercury Communications for nearly CDollars
1bn.
Mr Raymond Cyr, 59, who since 1987 has led BCE back to its core telecom
businesses after several years of disastrous diversification into property,
energy and financial services, retires on April 1 and will be succeeded by
former banker Mr Lynton Wilson, president for two years.
Mr Cyr will remain a director and adviser to Mr Wilson as well as
non-executive chairman of Bell Canada, the telephone utility, and several
other BCE subsidiaries.
BCE's net profit for the year to December 1992 was CDollars 1.295bn, or
CDollars 4.21 per share, up 5 per cent from CDollars 1.235bn, or CDollars
4.01, in 1991. Revenues rose 4.5 per cent to CDollars 20.8bn, a new peak.
Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 505m, or CDollars 1.65 a share, up from
CDollars 346m, or CDollars 1.11, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars
5.5bn, against CDollars 4.9bn. The 1992 period included a CDollars 95m gain
on the sale of TransCanada Pipelines shares.
Bell Canada provided the bulk of BCE's profits. Its 1992 performance
improved with sharp gains in efficiency. Its contribution equalled CDollars
3.03 per BCE share against CDollars 2.97 in 1991 Operating revenues rose 1.7
per cent.
Northern Telecom contributed CDollars 1.11 per BCE share in 1992, up from 97
cents in 1991, with a strong fourth quarter.
But Montreal Trustco had a 31 cents-a-share negative impact, against a
contribution of 7 cents per BCE share in 1991. Property loans were written
down sharply.

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Occidental to sell off coal
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OCCIDENTAL Petroleum, the Los Angeles-based energy group, yesterday revealed
that its coal business was up for sale and said the company would take a
fourth-quarter, non-cash after-tax charge of Dollars 600m to cover the costs
of divesting it.
The announcement ended months of speculation about Occidental's plans. The
company had indicated coal was no longer a core business, but had never said
it planned to leave the business entirely.
Moody's Investors Service placed Occidental's long-term debt and commercial
paper under review for potential downgrading. It cited concern 'for the
financial performance of Occidental's core business and its continuing high
financial leverage, despite substantial restructuring efforts undertaken by
the company since 1991'.
Standard &amp; Poor's, however, affirmed its ratings on Occidental's senior and
subordinated debt and its commercial paper, reflecting 'the solid business
positions of Occidental's oil and gas, petrochemicals, and natural gas
pipeline businesses.'
Occidental reported fourth-quarter income from continuing operations of
Dollars 14m (5 cents a share), compared with Dollars 7m (2 cents) a year
earlier. Including discontinued operations, the company had a net loss of
Dollars 588m (Dollars 1.94) in the latest quarter against net income of
Dollars 6m (2 cents), in 1991. Sales slipped to Dollars 2.3bn, from Dollars
2.5bn.
Mr Ray Irani, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We have implemented
significant new cost savings measures including a salary freeze and
substantial reductions in personnel, and we expect these measures to have a
positive impact on our results in 1993. We have made no secret of the fact
that our coal operation is not one of our core businesses, and we are
proceeding with its disposal in a prudent and orderly fashion.' The company
said it was discussing the sale of its coal business with several interested
parties.
For the full year, Occidental had income from continuing operations of
Dollars 126m, against Dollars 372m in 1991. The company posted a net loss of
Dollars 591m (Dollars 1.97 a share) in 1992, compared with net income of
Dollars 460m (Dollars 1.52). In 1992, Occidental took net charges of Dollars
244m for the adoption of new accounting standards. On Wall Street, shares in
Occidental closed up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 18 1/2 .

FT  29 JAN 93 / Greentree replaced at Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS Greentree, who built Lasmo into one of the UK's leading independent
oil and gas exploration companies and led its 1991 takeover of rival
Ultramar, was yesterday replaced as chief executive.
Lasmo's shares fell 8p to 155p on fears the company would take the
opportunity of a boardroom change to cut its dividend when it announces
results in March. High borrowings, partly because of the Ultramar takeover,
and a weak oil price have dented Lasmo's earnings. A maintained final
dividend would almost certainly be uncovered.
Mr Greentree's sudden departure drew parallels with BP, where a boardroom
split led to last June's ousting of Mr Bob Horton, chairman, and to BP
cutting its dividend. However, Lord Rees, Lasmo's chairman, insisted that
57-year-old Mr Greentree was leaving to pursue other interests and that the
parting was 'extremely friendly'. 'This is not a Horton drama,' he said.
Mr Joe Darby, formerly chief operating officer and with the company since
1979, was made Mr Greentree's successor. Lasmo said Mr Darby would continue
with the disposals and the reducing of overheads following the Ultramar
acquisition. Rumours of other imminent senior management changes were
'totally untrue', Lord Rees said.
The change in leadership was greeted with mixed feelings. A large
institutional shareholder said he was 'comfortable' with the announcement,
although he feared a dividend cut was now more likely. Analysts expect Lasmo
to announce net income of about Pounds 29m for the year to 30 September,
equal to earnings per share of about 3p. Dividends last year totalled 8.5p,
suggesting the final payment would need to be heavily cut to remain covered.
Last July the interim dividend was held at 2.3p. Lord Rees said: 'We have
not decided on the dividend, and will not do so until the final figures are
in.'
Lasmo raised Dollars 1.53bn (Pounds 1bn) through disposals last year, which
included some of Ultramar's North American and North Sea assets. However,
according to some estimates, year-end net borrowings were Pounds 1bn, giving
gearing of 92 per cent.
Mr Greentree, a Canadian, who was first associated with Lasmo in 1973,
became chief executive in 1982.

What on earth does the New Statesman and Society think it's up to in
printing sensational allegations about the prime minister?
It may be a good way of promoting the magazine's relaunch - reputedly
financed by the proceeds of selling its picture of security service chief
Stella Rimington, the only extant snap showing her face. But besides risking
the organ's future by courting enormous damages, the action is scarcely in
keeping with its past.
In particular, such a sort of journalism is enough to set the Statesman's
starchy founders, Fabians Sidney and Beatrice Webb, spinning in their urns.

As it's a chairman's job to hire and fire chief executives, it was right and
proper that the tricky calls about Chris Greentree's departure from Lasmo
should be fielded by Lord Rees, the former Tory MP now in the company's top
seat.
Nevertheless, he might well have been able to get his message across to the
media even better if the man doing the departing didn't happen to be the
husband of Lasmo's public relations chief, Hilary Wilson.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARNER Estates Holdings, the property investment group, saw pre-tax profits
dip slightly from Pounds 7.64m to Pounds 7.48m in the year ended September
30 1992.
Turnover improved 19 per cent to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 10.2m).
Although rental income was unchanged at Pounds 8.3m, revenue from property
trading jumped from Pounds 147,000 to Pounds 1.77m, thanks to the sale of a
large property in the Midlands.
However, increased costs led to lower overall operating profits of Pounds
6.19m (Pounds 6.47m).
Mr David Veaser, finance director, said the residential and retail markets,
to which the group was mainly exposed, were likely to react first to any
recovery in the property market.
Earnings per share were 11.15p, against 10.8p. The final dividend is 7p
(6.75p) to make a total of 10.5p (10p).

EUROPEAN airlines said yesterday the number of passengers they carried on

Brussels.
The Association of European Airlines said its 23 members carried 110m
passengers over the year, 11.7m up on 1991 when traffic was hit by the Gulf
war which persuaded many prospective passengers to stay at home.
The AEA also forecast gloomy financial results for its members last year.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7):
Helping cash over the generation gap - The Experts' Panel, Investment for
Children / Tax is a snare when adults want to pass on a little wealth. The
possible solutions include National Savings, friendly societies, gilts and
collective funds
</HEADLINE>

MOST PARENTS worry about their children's future and want to ensure that
they have a modicum of financial independence once they reach adulthood.
But the Inland Revenue, keen to stamp on a potential area for tax evasion,
does not make it easy for parents to pass money to their offspring.
Accordingly, we asked our panel of financial experts to recommend
investments for children in the light of all the complex tax rules.
According to Charles Pascoe, of accountants Stoy Hayward: 'The tax problem
that every parent comes up against when investing for children is caused by
section 663 of the Taxes Act 1988, relating to parents' settlements on
children.
'These provisions broadly cover the situation where a parent gives an asset
to a child under 18. Any income derived from that asset will continue to be
taxed as if it were owned by the parent (except where the child's income is
less than Pounds 100 in a tax year).
'Two attractive investments are not caught by section 663.
'Issue E of National Savings Children's Bonus Bonds will produce an
excellent tax-free return (in today's falling interest-rate climate) of 7.85
per cent per annum compound after five years. Unfortunately, the maximum
holding for each child is Pounds 1,000.
'The 6th issue of index-linked National Savings Certificates has a maximum
holding of Pounds 5,000. If held for five years, the certificates will grow
in value in line with the Retail Price Index over the period, plus 3.25 per
cent per annum compound. If the recent devaluation of the pound eventually
forces up prices, this could prove an excellent return on maturity.
'The tax rules do not attack capital gains made by a child resulting from a
gift, and therefore parents could attempt to use their child's annual CGT
exemption (currently Pounds 5,800). This could be achieved by purchasing an
asset such as a painting, antiques or shares, where any increase in value is
essentially of a capital nature.
'Finally, it is worth looking out for those savings institutions which
periodically offer above average interest rates specifically for those under
18. These accounts might be good investments in the case of gifts from a
grandparent or as a result of birthday presents of cash from friends and
relations. The income would probably, in such circumstances, be tax-free as
the child could use its personal allowance, and the parent, on behalf of the
child should complete form R85(1990), obtainable from the building society,
in order for the interest to be paid gross.'
David Harris, of accountants Chantrey Vellacott, also highlights the tax
issue, and divides children's investments into those given by parents and
those given by others. For investments given by parents, he suggests:
National Savings Children's Bonds, National Savings certificates, friendly
society baby bonds, and Premium Bonds.
'The Children's Bonds,' he points out, 'can be purchased by anyone aged over
16, on behalf of anyone under 16. The 40th issue of fixed-interest National
Savings certificates offers a guaranteed tax-free return of 5.75 per cent
per annum compound, when held for five years, and the maximum holding is
Pounds 5,000.
'For longer-term investment, friendly society baby bonds can be purchased by
any adult for any child before its 18th birthday. Only one baby bond per
child is permitted and the maximum investment is Pounds 18 per month or
Pounds 200 per annum.
'Most friendly societies have schemes whereby a lump-sum investment, at
outset, can be used to fund the purchase of the baby bond plan throughout
its 10-year term. One should be aware that there are fairly heavy surrender
penalties on these schemes, and it is always best to ensure that they run
their full 10-year term.
'At maturity, the plan can be encashed to provide a tax-free cash lump sum,
or simply left to continue the tax-free growth or provide a regular tax-free
income.
'My personal favourites in the baby bond market are the Family Assurance
Junior Bond and the Homeowners Friendly Society Bond, linked to the Rupert
Bear unit trust, managed by Invesco MIM.'
When those other than parents are giving investments, Mr Harris suggests the
following options: gilts, building society accounts, unit trust savings
schemes and offshore funds.
'Gilts offer a wide choice of maturity dates and coupon yields, and can,
therefore, be selected to fit the circumstances of most junior investors.
'Since most gilts are trading above par value, it may be preferable to
consider a fixed-interest unit trust, and my recommendations would include
Kleinwort Benson's Gilt trust and Whittingdale's Gilt Income trust. These
trusts pay dividends net of basic rate tax, and this tax will have to be
reclaimed from the Inland Revenue.
'Regular unit-trust savings contracts can provide a simple and cheap means
of growing a sizeable lump sum. My personal recommendations would be M &amp; G
and James Capel, thanks to the longer-term investment expertise of the
former and the index-tracking funds of the latter.
John Edwards, a former FT journalist and now consultant at Berry, Birch &amp;
Noble, says:
'For a parent to take advantage of the child's full personal tax allowance
of Pounds 3,445, a simple 'bare' trust is the answer, provided you are
prepared for the money to be locked away until the child is 18 years old.
More complicated trusts can be used to shelter children's investments from
the taxman, but they require legal advice (and expense) to set up properly.
'The special National Savings children's bonus bonds and baby bonds offered
by friendly societies provide tax-free returns and look good on paper.
'One of the cheapest and most effective ways of investing on behalf of a
child is a regular savings scheme with an investment trust company. Charges
are very low, and small amounts each month can become quite a large fund
over the years.
'A unit trust specially designed for children is the Invesco Rupert
Children's fund. Investing solely in UK blue-chip shares, it has quite a
good performance record since being launched in 1988 as a bit of a gimmick.
'Its big attraction, however, is the very low minimum lump sum investment of
Pounds 50 permitted. This makes it suitable for birthday presents or gifts.
Fond grandparents, for example, can give Pounds 250 a person each year
exempt from inheritance tax to as many children as they like. If units in
the Rupert fund are bought through the Homeowners Friendly Society, then the
proceeds can also be tax-free up to the restrictions governing the baby
bond.
Mark Bolland, of financial advisers Chamberlain de Broe, says:
'Because savings for children is long term in nature, simple deposits are
unlikely to be effective. In most cases, parents will be looking for maximum
returns with as high a level of security as possible, but with interest
rates so poor at present, alternatives are needed.
'National Savings offer healthy, secure returns - the Children's Bonus Bonds
(issue E) are ideal. Parents could also buy other issues, such as the 6th
issue index-linked certificates. Those of a gambling bent can buy Premium
Bonds - the prizes can be considerable and the odds (with draws every month)
fair.
'Avoid any off-the-peg regular savings schemes from insurance companies.
There are, of course, tax benefits from friendly society bonds, but the
charges involved can be very high and the effect over the term of the plan
can be dramatic. Some people like the with-profits approach, and it is true
that companies such as the Tunbridge Wells Equitable have very successful
funds.
'With an investment term of 15 to 20 years, investment trusts can provide
very healthy returns - in many respects they are ideal. The charges on a
regular savings plan are very low compared with other savings media.
'A more conservative investor could buy long-dated zero-dividend shares of
split-capital investment trusts, which can be chosen for redemption when the
child is 18 or 19. These can offer high returns with reasonable security.
'Gilts themselves can be highly attractive, given that the return and date
of redemption are known at the outset. However, with interest rates so low,
many suitable gilts are over par, and so the return will be diminished. It
may be worth investors waiting until next year, to see what effect the new
issues have on the market.'

FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pledge given over unification of
VAT
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR John Cope, paymaster-general, assured the Commons last night that the
government was not 'wedded' to the unification of taxation rates across the
European Community, Ivor Owen writes.
He was seeking to allay fears about the provisions in the Maastricht treaty
dealing with the harmonisation of indirect taxes during further debate on
the European Communities (Amendment) Bill.
Sir John urged critics of the treaty not to confuse harmonisation and
unison. He said 'harmony involves different notes which blend with one and
other to create a pleasing overall sound'. Harmonisation did not mean that
every member state had to have exactly the same tax system or rates.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs and fraud office in Maxwell
deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office and the Commons social security committee failed to
reach agreement last night on how to proceed with planned public hearings
into the theft of funds from Maxwell company pension schemes.
The SFO requested earlier this week that hearings arranged by the committee
be called off because some of those due to appear at them could be material
witnesses in criminal proceedings.
The SFO had argued that disclosure of some information could lead defendants
to argue that they had been denied the opportunity of a fair trial.
In a two-hour meeting late yesterday, MPs on the committee put five options
to the SFO for dealing with the hearings. They expect to receive their
response in time to take a final decision the week after next. One option is
to hold all the hearings in private.
The MPs told the SFO that some of their forthcoming hearings will not be
affected by the SFO's concerns. They emphasise that the decision about how
to handle the hearings will ultimately be for them rather than the SFO. The
SFO's views will be taken into account, though.

GRANADA, the leisure, television and computer services group, and Thorn EMI,
the electronics group, yesterday won a joint appeal at a Customs and Excise
tribunal that they will not be required to pay value added tax on insurance
premiums for rental equipment.
The two companies had made no provisions in their accounts because they
believed they were confident of winning, but an adverse ruling would have
cost them more than Pounds 50m.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Costs threaten 'free' banking: Current account charges may
be reinstated to pay Pounds 4.5bn clearing bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS have moved a step closer to the reintroduction of charges on personal
customers' accounts with the discovery that the cash and cheque clearing
system is costing them Pounds 4.5bn a year.
The figure was worked out by the Association for Payment Clearing Services
during an industry-wide review started by the banks last year. It is the
first time the banks have managed to quantify the cost of clearing.
In the past, the clearing system was subsidised by banks earning interest on
customers' funds, but banks are now considering reintroducing charges, even
on personal accounts that are in credit, in order to cover their overheads.
Since late 1985, the big four English clearing banks have all provided free
banking to customers who keep their current accounts in credit. Other banks,
including Co-operative Bank and Scottish banks, had already followed the
same policy.
The study of clearing costs will also give added impetus to banks' efforts
to cut the number of branches and staff. Cost reduction is one component of
attempts to raise operating profits to compensate for lending losses in the
1980s.
Three cheque and credit clearing companies operate different types of
clearing services under Apacs. Some 21 banks participate directly in these
operating companies, while hundreds of other institutions have access to
clearing through them.
The Pounds 4.5bn figure is disclosed in Apacs' annual report, which also
says that banks and building societies contained the rise in credit card
fraud to 10 per cent in 1992. They lost Pounds 165.6m to fraud in 1991, up
35 per cent on 1990.
The volume and value of lower-value cheques passing through the clearing
system in 1992 fell for the second year running after many years of growth.
The value of cleared cheques fell 3 per cent to Pounds 4.18bn a day, and
volume fell 4 per cent to 8.6m.
The volume of transactions passing through the banks' Bacs system for bulk
electronic clearing rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 1.8bn, while there was a 12
per cent rise in volume in the Chaps system for high-value credit clearing.
The Apacs review is still under way, and banks will decide on strategies
after receiving the full results. Mr Dick Allen, Apacs chief executive, says
in the Apacs annual report that cost reduction 'is a high priority'. The
banks started the review to take account of changes in banking services
including the growth of telephone banking.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Pension sellers may be hit by tax move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SELLERS of personal pensions must inform their clients about changes to tax
rules which will make the pensions less attractive, the Department of Social
Security has said.
Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life assurance industry, yesterday
was the first to issue guidelines requiring companies to contact clients for
whom it may no longer be worthwhile to maintain current personal pension
arrangements when new tax rules come into effect on April 6.
If the individuals follow this advice, it could mean the loss of billions of
pounds of premium income for the industry.
The other self-regulatory bodies, Fimbra, Imro and the Securities and
Investments Board, are also to issue guidelines in the next few weeks. The
guidelines say enforcement officials from the SROs (self-regulatory
organisations) will be checking company records in the coming year to make
sure best advice is given.
'The government and regulators are keen to ensure that anyone considering
their pension provision receives the best possible advice,' the Department
of Social Security said.
There are roughly 5m holders of personal pensions in Britain. The product
has been the life insurance industry's single biggest source of new business
in the past year. Rebates of national insurance contributions (NICs) have
made them particularly attractive to young people although as individuals
age, the tax advantages disappear.
Industry officials estimate that one half to two thirds of all personal
pension holders are so-called 'rebate only'. That means that the only
contribution paid into their personal pensions are the rebate from their
NICs.
The new tax rules cut the rebate of NIC available to those who contract out
of the state earnings related pension scheme.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (23): All in one basket, or
pick your own - Self-Select &amp; Single-Company PEPs / Two variations that may
appeal to the investor who has time and knowledge - as well as the
willingness to accept greater risk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SELF-SELECT and single-company personal equity plans are the lesser
principalities within the Pep empire.
Neither has been as popular as managed and trust-based Peps, but both can
stake a claim to a place in an investor's portfolio.
Single company Peps were launched at the beginning of 1991, with the main
aim of allowing employees in an approved share-option scheme to transfer
their shares to a Pep once the shares emerged from the scheme. The transfer
can be made directly, without the usual 'bed and breakfasting' arrangement
and without any liability for capital gains tax, so long as the transfer is
made within 90 days.
Individuals are allowed to invest Pounds 3,000 a year in a single-company
Pep a year, in addition to the Pounds 6,000 general Pep limit. Over 110,000
single-company plans were taken out in 1991, and the amount invested was
Pounds 270m, according to figures from the Inland Revenue. This represents
only 5 per cent of the total Pep market by number of plans, and just over 4
per cent of the market by value.
The main drawback with single-company Peps for the general investor is the
risk resulting from lack of diversification. If you put the whole of your
Pep investment in one share, you risk that company collapsing. A general Pep
allows you to increase diversification over the years - by putting in Pounds
6,000 a year for 5 years, for example, you would be able to get a fair
degree of diversification.
You can, of course, take out a different single-company Pep each year. They
are also very useful for those who have already accumulated a substantial
portfolio of shares and want to hold as much as possible in a tax-efficient
form.
Beginner investors, however, should only consider a single-company Pep if
they have already used up the maximum in a general Pep.
Single-company Peps can be managed by a Pep plan manager, but are more
popular on a self-select basis. John Spiers, of BESt Investment, says that
most single-company plans are self-select, because it is difficult for
investors to justify the difference in cost with a managed Pep when the
investment dilemma is restricted to choosing a single stock.
For many people, the most suitable companies are likely to be those which
offer a good yield and are able to maintain their dividend.
An even cheaper way of taking out a single-company Pep is through a Pep
provider whose costs are subsidised by the company itself. Many FT-SE 100
companies provide this service, to reward their existing their small
investors and to encourage new ones.
The main Pep providers who specialise in this field are Bradford &amp; Bingley,
Hoare Govett, NatWest stockbrokers and Cazenove. CCC&amp;P, which also used to
be heavily involved in corporate Peps, closed this part of its business in
October, recommending companies to transfer instead to Henderson
Administration.
The drawback with obtaining a Pep in this way - for example, an ICI Pep
through its sponsors, Hoare Govett - is that you cannot then switch another
company's shares into the plan, if your view of ICI's prospects changes.
Self-select Peps are general Peps, subject to the usual Pounds 6,000 per
year maximum; but, as their name suggests, the stock is chosen by the
investor rather than a plan manager.
Clearly, self-select Peps will only appeal to those with the time and the
knowledge to manage their own portfolio. Investors will still have to
operate through a plan manager, because only they are authorised to run
Peps.
Roz Barder, editor of Chase de Vere's Pepguide, says that out of the 700
schemes listed in the guide, only 75 are self-select. Your choice of Pep
plan manager is therefore more limited, but that can make the task easier.
The important criteria for making a choice will be the size and structure of
charges, efficiency of service and administration, and any restrictions or
conditions imposed on the Pep by its plan managers.
Some plan managers structure their charge on the self-select Pep in a way to
discourage frequent dealing. Others may have cheaper dealing charges but
higher management or initial charges. Some will have both high dealing and
management charges, and should therefore be avoided.
BESt Personal Equity Plan has calculated total charges on a self-select Pep
as a percentage cost of the investment. The calculation assumes that the
full amount was put in when the plan was taken out, and that the average
investor changed his portfolio twice during a three-year period.
The average cost for the average investor is 13.3 per cent on these
assumptions. Mr Spiers says that two of the cheapest providers are Alliance
Trust and Lloyds Bank, with 1.8 per cent and 4.9 per cent respectively.
There are restrictions, however. Alliance Trust requires you to deposit the
first Pounds 1,500 in one of its investment trusts, while Lloyds Bank, with
its very low brokerage commission of 0.2 per cent, only deals on a certain
day each month and restricts the choice of stock to a list of 100 blue-chip
companies.
Many of the plan managers charge a management fee for self-select Peps,
which may appear incongruous because it is the investor who is managing the
Pep by selecting stock and deciding when to buy or sell. However, Ms Barder
says that companies without a management charge will probably impose a fee
for dividend collection instead. She also advises investors to watch out for
exit penalties.
If you are going to be a relatively inactive investor, a self-select Pep
should work out to be much cheaper than a managed Pep, but frequent dealing
will raise the costs. If you are an active investor, it is probably better
to take out a self-select Pep with a stockbroker, because dealing can be
done immediately, rather than at the end of the day or at certain points in
the month, which is a system that many of the banks operate.
Consider, too, whether there are restrictions on the number of stocks that
can be held in the Pep, and whether you have the flexibility to choose any
stock you like, including an investment or unit trust. Some plan managers
will provide advice, despite the Pep's being self-select, but this is likely
to be when you already have an existing portfolio with them.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (22): Less attractive than
the collective route - Managed PEPs / A rule change and the absence of
performance figures have weakened a once-popular tax shelter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGED Peps used to be the bread and butter of the Pep industry. While
investment and unit trust Peps were limited to a maximum of Pounds 3,000
until last year, the full Pounds 6,000 could be put into a general Pep.
Those who already had a portfolio of equities could simply shelter a portion
of these from tax by putting them into a Pep. Other investors, attracted by
the tax breaks, could leave it to the discretion of a Pep plan manager to
choose their shares. The limits on collective funds (apart from new-issue
investment trusts, which qualified for the full Pounds 6,000) meant that the
remaining Pounds 3,000 had to be topped up with shares - again, a decision
that many investors would rather leave to the experts.
But a combination of factors has conspired to make managed Peps less
attractive. John Spiers, of BESt Investment, estimates that managed Peps now
account for only 20 per cent of the Pep market, and expects to see that
proportion fall further.
One reason has been the lifting of the Pep limit on collective funds last
year, with the exception of those that are 50 per cent or more invested in
non-European markets. (These funds have an annual Pep limit of Pounds
1,500.) Unit trusts have particularly benefited, partly because the global
nature of many investment trusts means that they are still trapped by the
non-EC Pep limit.
For small investors, in particular, collective funds are a way of diluting
equity investment risk, because of the large number of stocks they hold.
Since some unit and investment trust companies charge no extra for 'pepping'
the investment, they hold considerable appeal for those who may wish, in any
case, to invest in a collective fund.
A second reason for the demise of the managed Pep is the lack of performance
figures. Managed Peps come in many varieties: share-only, a mixture of
collective funds and shares, or a mixture of unit and investment trusts.
This makes comparison difficult. We wrote to all those who operate a managed
Pep service, requesting performance figures for this article, but the
overwhelming response was that it was difficult to provide any. For example,
Sheppards, the London-based brokers, said: 'Clients who have not selected
their own stocks and are looked after by Sheppards Fund managers tend to
have a portfolio constructed to cater for their own particular requirements.
We do not feel in all honesty we could produce figures which would be
meaningful.'
This can be a problem for investors, because they are unable to select a
plan manager on the basis of performance. The variety of managed Peps, the
fact that many are managed as an extension to an existing client's
portfolio, and the effect of different charging structures make it difficult
to produce figures. By contrast, the performance of a unit trust or
investment trust Pep is easily charted, because these funds have prices
quoted on a daily basis.
This leaves many investors with little guidance but to base their choice on
the charges levied on a Pep. Charges also vary considerably, but many are
likely to have an initial charge of 1 to 6 per cent, an annual management
fee of 1 to 1.5 per cent and dealing charges in the region of 1.65 per cent.
Some may charge a flat fee for the initial charge or brokerage.
Jamie Berry, of Berry Asset Management, says that when it comes to choosing
a Pep, the single most important factor is its cost structure. He warns
investors not to be lured by a low initial charge only to find that dealing
costs are high. Berry Asset management's own Pep charges are a 2 per cent
initial fee, 1.25 per cent annual fee and 1.5 per cent brokerage.
For many people, such charges may mean that they should not have a Pep at
all. Mr Berry points out that a Pep is not so much a product as a way of
holding equities in order to avoid paying income and capital gains tax.
There are now over 2m general plans in existence. On the conservative
assumption that the same investors in the first year have taken out a new
Pep each year since the launch of Peps in 1987, there must now be at least
420,000 people who have one. Yet the number of people paying capital gains
tax has dwindled from 165,000 in 1988-89 to an estimated 85,000 in 1992-93.
This leaves income tax. The costs of a Pep will almost certainly be greater
than the income tax savings for a basic-rate taxpayer, but a higher-rate
taxpayer may find he saves tax after a number of years, particularly once
time has eroded the effect of the initial charge.
If you are interested in a Pep for the income tax savings, you should
obviously choose one that is geared towards a high yield. However, there is
nothing necessarily wrong with a high-risk Pep aimed at capital growth, so
long as you know what you are buying.
For the cautious, Roz Barder, of Chase de Vere, recommends James Capel's
Footsie Pep fund - which tracks the FT-SE 100 index, as the 'ideal fund for
those new to the equity market,' because it has always been difficult for
specific funds to outperform the market.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (21): Best choice if you
haven't a portfolio - Unit and Investment Trusts / Savings schemes currently
seem to be one of the investment world's best-kept secrets. Charges are
usually no greater than for buying in a lump sum

UNIT AND investment trust Peps seem to be the face of the future.
Now that the full Pounds 6,000 Pep limit can be invested in unit or
investment trusts, sales have taken off. The Unit Trust Association's
figures for net unit trust Pep sales show a startling rise in support for
the products once the limit was raised. Sales in the second quarter of this
year totalled Pounds 336m, compared with only Pounds 166m in the equivalent
quarter of 1991. This was even higher than the Pounds 216m taken in the
end-of-tax-year rush in the first quarter of this year.
In the three months to the end of September, when almost all the news seemed
to be bad for equities, net sales of unit trust Peps were Pounds 319m,
compared with only Pounds 144m for the previous year.
Plainly the public thinks these Peps are a good idea. Figures for investment
trusts are more difficult to come by, because it is harder to keep track of
the ownership of individual investment trust shares. However, several
management companies have reported significantly increased sales, and the
success of the newly launched trusts at the end of the 1991-92 tax year
indicated the pent-up demand. M&amp;G's Income and Recovery trusts raised Pounds
376m between them.
With the tax-free annual limits now equal for collective funds and directly
held equities, it is difficult to justify the use of any other vehicle by
those who do not have large portfolios of directly held shares.
There are several reasons for this:
Peps are now being marketed as a mainstream savings vehicle, but Pounds
6,000 is not a large enough equity portfolio to guard against the risk of
capital loss. Collective trusts allow you to diversify your risk.
The charges within the trusts allow the portfolio to be actively managed at
no extra cost to the investor, while minimum dealing commissions eat into
any active portfolio management in a direct-equity Pep.
Information on past performance is much easier to come by if the underlying
investment vehicle is a unit or investment trust, which can be monitored.
Comparison of different managed Peps with any certainty has proved
difficult, but comparison of unit and investment trusts is easy.
A limited price war started this year between the different groups, as they
have realised that the only way they could sell new products was through
Peps.
A quirk in pricing, which allows unit trust groups to be more innovative in
pricing Peps than in pricing their basic product, has helped the process.
And another argument in favour of unit trust Peps is simply that, if you
were going to buy a unit trust anyway, and it costs no more to do so through
a Pep, then you may as well take advantage of the tax benefits, even if they
will not have a great immediate effect.
Finally, collective trusts make it much easier to invest in savings schemes
through regular savings rather than in a lump sum. If the Pep is to be used
to fund a mortgage, when the typical buyer will already have spent a
four-figure sum in other fees, investment via a lump sum is impractical.
Pep savings schemes currently seem to be one of the investment world's
best-kept secrets. Charges are usually no greater than for buying in one
lump sum, even though the expenses of administration are greater.
According to Roz Barder, of Chase De Vere's Pepguide, there are now about 65
separate unit trust Pep savings schemes to choose from, and about 23 schemes
for investment trusts. There are also about 10 savings schemes which allow
regular savings into Peps that buy a mix of shares and unit trusts, and six
which allow this for mixtures of investment trusts and other shares.
The minimum monthly investment tends to be slightly greater than for
un-Pepped savings schemes, but still allows for very parsimonious saving.
According to Ms Barder, the average monthly minimum for unit trusts is
Pounds 50, while for investment trusts it is Pounds 100. These are not too
high to deter those who are saving to back mortgages or school fees.
A plan by the Inland Revenue to oblige regular savers to re-apply for their
Pep each year now appears to have been watered down.
According to the UTA, the current suggestion is that Pep providers make
clear on their form that the commitment should be either open-ended or for
one year only; and investors must make a choice from this 'dual track'
option. Managers will also need to remind savers annually that they are
allowed no more than one Pounds 6,000 Pep each year.
The Pounds 1,500 limit on annual investments in funds that are 50 per cent
or more invested in non-European markets remains a fly in the ointment for
the sector. While the limit for investing in Peps as a whole was doubled,
the restriction on international funds was left unchanged. This affects some
of the longest-established and largest investment trusts, such as Foreign &amp;
Colonial and Bankers. This led F&amp;C to launch a special Pep investment trust
(Pepit) in October, which was mainly invested in FT-SE stocks.
Investment and unit trusts are also covered on pages 27 and 28 of the Review

FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (20): Five steps to be taken
with care - How To Choose One / If you plan to dip your toe into the stock
market for the first time, the risks attached to a single-company or managed
Pep cannot be justified. Collective investments are safer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INDUSTRY-WIDE figures may show that Peps are competitive against other
investments, but that does not help when you are choosing one particular
Pep.
The fund management industry has too many players for its own good, and this
is reflected in the needless variety of Peps on offer. Some of these give
extra choices which will help investors. Others confuse the issue.
Stripping out the marketing fluff, you are buying a Pep to gain exposure to
equities - sensible only if you are prepared to wait for the long term, and
to take some risk - and to gain a shelter from tax. Bear this in mind, and
consider the following factors in turn:
Self-select or collective trust?
Your choice of Pep will be governed first by how equities fit into the rest
of your investments. If you already have a share portfolio, then it makes
sense each year to transfer the maximum portion of it allowable into a
tax-free pocket. As you have already decided on the shares it contains, you
will not require any fresh management services for the Pep; so just choose a
'self-select' Pep manager who can offer good administration at a low price.
But if you do not already have a large portfolio of equities, and you will
be using a Pep to dip your toe into the stock market for the first time,
then a single-company Pep, or a managed equity Pep, is more or less
indefensible. The risks which come with small, undiversified equity holdings
cannot be justified. And this points to unit or investment trusts.
How much does it cost?
The charges on the Pep (explored elsewhere in this survey) are important,
and vary widely. They are known at the time you buy. An even more important
factor, unfortunately, is unknowable at the time you buy, and that is how
the investment will perform. But there are ways of making educated guesses.
Again you have two main factors to consider - asset allocation and
individual stock selection.
Which sector?
These products usually come packaged into sectors to make the asset
allocation easy. For example, you can choose between smaller companies, blue
chips, and broad European trusts without difficulty. You simply need to
decide which will perform best.
Each year, the top performers from the industry routinely come from the same
sector, so it is obvious that choice of sector is important. However, this
is not an argument for investing in the current top performer.
For example, gold trusts had a great month in September 1990, and were the
strongest sector. But longer-term statistics reveal this was a 'blip' - in
the three years to December 1992, commodity and energy trusts lost 28 per
cent on average, according to Micropal. That period includes one month in
which the sector was the top performer.
At present, smaller companies are showing strong signs of revival after a
long time in the doldrums, and several managers, such as GT Management, are
backing them to outperform, if a strong recovery arrives.
Which manager?
But then you need to choose the manager who will make the best job of it.
This could be tricky.
Past performance figures are regularly published in this Review, and provide
you with some clues. But it is best to look beyond the current top
performers, and short-term high-fliers, to see if any managers have
delivered consistent high performance compared with the competition.
If a fund is regularly in the top quartile (25 per cent) or decile (10 per
cent) of its sector, it is likely to provide a much smoother ride than a
trust which occasionally comes out on top, but sometimes dips below average.
Also, fund management is a subjective discipline, so that performance varies
significantly, according to the individual in charge of the fund. It is
therefore important to ask questions about the people managing the trust,
and how long they have been in place. If strong performance has been
delivered by a manager who has just resigned, it does not count for much.
Similarly, it is dangerous to generalise about fund-management groups. Most
tend to have their specialisms, and the quality of their personnel will be
variable, so that strong performance in one sector does not necessarily mean
they will be good in another.
Growth or income?
Finally, you need to make a choice between growth and income. The more you
want one, the less likely you are to be able to deliver the other.
In general, income becomes more important as you grow older. Those still
deriving a regular income from a salary, who can afford to sit back and wait
for an investment to grow, would be better off investing for growth.
Income-providing Peps come in two broad varieties. If they are based on a
unit trust, then they will hold a portfolio of shares in high-yielding
companies - in other words, the dividend they pay out each year makes a
higher proportion of the share price than average. These generally aim to
deliver a yield 25 per cent better than that of the FT-All Share, which at
the turn of the year was hovering around 4.5 per cent, so the income on
offer, before charges, should be at least 6 per cent.
Such unit trusts bring with them a chance of long-term capital growth. If
the income is reinvested, they still tend to outperform trusts aimed at
growth, which pay less in dividends.
However, as pure income providers, they are likely to be beaten by the
special investment trust Pep packages, which use income shares of
split-capital trusts to provide a higher yield. In a split-capital trust,
all the income from dividends is paid out through income shares, which will
only make up a third of the trust's capital. In this simple example, this
would make the yield on an income share three times higher than it would
otherwise be.
High-income investment trust Pep packages should therefore provide a higher
yield than income unit trusts, simply because of these technical
characteristics.
But you do not get something for nothing. In a split-capital trust, other
classes of share - typically zero-dividend preference shares and capital
shares - will have a superior call on any capital growth. So the chances of
a long-term rising income, or of competitive capital growth, are limited if
you use this route. Indeed, there is a real risk of capital loss, and in
some cases, a loss is guaranteed. This is a trade-off individuals must make
for themselves.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (18):  More refinement is
still needed - A Pep currently offers a higher-rate taxpayer a better return
than a building society. But changes to the rules, and more ingenuity by the
institutions, may be necessary if the small saver is to be attracted
</HEADLINE>

THE FUTURE of the personal equity plan looks a lot brighter than it did a
year ago.
First, Chancellor Norman Lamont did the sensible thing and allowed the vast
majority of unit and investment trusts to qualify for the full Pounds 6,000
annual Pep limit. The need for investors to rely on the high-charging (and
often poorly-performing) managed Peps disappeared overnight.
Then, the Conservatives won the general election and the Labour party's
plans for Pep reform evaporated for at least four years (although not before
some dubious 'buy now while Peps last' marketing campaigns).
At the end of 1992, the crash disappeared from five-year performance figures
and the stock market reached record highs. At last, advisers had a realistic
chance of persuading investors that equity-based products could offer higher
rewards, and not just higher risks.
Finally, the industry started to offer attractive new charging structures
that rewarded long-term holders and reduced the burden of initial fees. One
fundamental problem of Peps - that the charges often outweigh the tax
benefits - has started to be addressed.
With equities yielding around 4.4 per cent and base rates at 7 per cent at
the end of 1992, a higher-rate investor could look forward to a post-tax
income from Peps equal to, or higher than, that available from the building
society - with the prospect of capital growth on top.
Not that the result of all these favourable factors was an automatic boost
for Pep sales. According to calculations by BESt Pep, an advisory service,
Pep sales in the first half of the 1992-93 were actually slightly lower (at
Pounds 900m) than in the first half of 1991-92. However, there had been a
shift within the market towards unit trusts and away from managed Peps.
Some perceive that a change in rules is needed to make Peps more successful.
ProShare, the organisation established to promote wider share ownership,
called for the creation of a 'MegaPep' to encourage those who come into lump
sums, via inheritance or retirement, to invest their capital in equities
immediately.
Rather than the current annual limit of Pounds 9,000 (Pounds 6,000 in a
general, and Pounds 3,000 in a single-company, Pep), the MegaPep would allow
an individual to invest a maximum of Pounds 80,000 over a rolling eight-year
period. Existing Peps could be rolled into the new scheme tax-free.
And the Unit Trust Association called for gilts and corporate bonds to
qualify for Peps, arguing that this would help the government to fund its
growing borrowing requirement.
But the government appeared to rule out the UTA's proposal in December, when
it blocked a loophole in the rules allowing gilt funds to qualify for Pep
status.
What will really make Peps take off, however, is if they come to be
perceived as tools for financial planning for specific events - such as
paying off a mortgage or meeting school fees. To date, this market has been
dominated by life insurance-related products, such as endowment policies.
Whether this represents 'best advice' or simply the higher commissions
available from life companies is open to question.
Certainly, advisers would have some justification in arguing that Peps, by
virtue of their youth, have not established the kind of long-term
performance record which could allow investors to be reasonably certain that
they will grow sufficiently to meet their commitments.
But Peps do offer: tax-efficiency (no income or capital gains tax is payable
on returns); flexibility (most make no redemption charge and the investor
can easily transfer allegiance to a new plan manager at the start of a new
tax year); and (on some plans) relatively low charges. If held for the long
term (at least five years), they are a highly attractive product.
More sophisticated investors are fully aware of the Pep's advantages. Some
have been using their annual allowances to shelter their existing
portfolios; others have spotted the attractions of products such as
Gartmore's index-tracking fund with a low front-end charge (Pounds 30 plus
VAT when held in a Pep, available through the broker WI Carr) and a 0.5 per
cent annual fee.
But it takes a while for a new product to become accepted by the general
investor. When selling Peps, a high-street name seems more important than a
reputation for fund-management skills. Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest, TSB and
the Bradford &amp; Bingley and Woolwich building societies all featured in the
top 10 for sales in the first half of the current tax year.
Realistically, it is only these institutions that have much hope of
achieving the government's original aim when it established Peps - that of
persuading the small saver to invest in shares.
But they may yet need to make further refinements to the product (such as
the guarantee of no capital loss, as offered by Legal &amp; General) before the
Pep can break out of its niche and into the main market.

The high-growth tax saver that turned to catastrophe - Hindsight / Brenda
Vernelle wanted to top up her savings as she approached retirement, so she
bought a maximum investment plan. However, the advantages that she had been
led to expect quickly evaporated
</HEADLINE>

ABOUT THIS time every year, financial salesmen unleash their most effective
weapon - the 'buy now while stocks last' argument.
The end of the tax year is helpful to them; but also, every budget is
preceded by speculation that some tax loophole or by speculation thatn some
tax loophole or by speculation than some tax loophole or another is about to
be closed.
In the haste that surrounds these occasions, many investors find themselves
with inappropriate products. This is not surprising - if the tax loophole
was worth exploiting in the first place, investors would have considered it
already.
But it can be worse. Sometimes, in haste, the client does not even get the
tax advantages.
This was the story for Brenda Vernelle, a polytechnic lecturer from
Huddersfield, Yorkshire, who was sold a Save &amp; Prosper maximum investment
plan (Mip) in the spring of 1984.
A Mip is a life assurance plan, which lasts a minimum of 10 years. The
amount of life cover bought with premiums is kept to a minimum, while the
maximum allowable goes towards investment. Thus it is effectively just a
savings plan, which brings limited life cover tagging along.
The spring of 1984 was when life assurance premium relief was removed in the
budget. Until then, tax relief was available on premiums paid into the plan,
which then went on to produce tax-free pay-outs from a relatively
tax-efficient fund. That tax relief was stopped, except for policies already
in force.
There had been much speculation that such a move was in the pipeline, and so
Ms Vernelle, who wanted to step up her savings as she approached retirement,
was persuaded to open a Mip.
She submitted her forms, and paid her first premiums, in April 1984, before
the tax changes came into effect.
But there was a problem. She said: 'There was a muddle over getting the
doctor's report on it initially, and by the time this came, even though I
had already paid three months on it, new legislation had been implemented,
and I lost tax relief on it anyway.'
This more or less destroyed the point of taking out the plan. However, Ms
Vernelle decided to carry on, under pressure from her salesman, who left the
company shortly afterwards.
Before taking it out, she had also asked for confirmation that the 10-year
limit was not binding. At that point, she wanted to retire at the age of 62,
an age she attained this year, which meant that she would ideally need to
surrender it after 7 1/2 years.
She was assured that she could do this without tax penalty, and that any
penalty for early encashment would be trivial.
In the event, she wanted to cash it in after seven years, in April 1991. By
this time she had paid in total premiums of Pounds 8,400. The total she
received as a pay-out was Pounds 8,725.81.
As she wryly pointed out, there was no problem with paying tax on this sum]
Total charges for early discontinuance of the policy had taken a bite of
Pounds 459.24 - rather more than her salesman had led her to believe.
For what was supposed to be a tax-efficient high-growth investment to boost
her retirement savings, the investment had proved to be 'catastrophic'. Base
rates stood at 14 per cent at the time she took the cash, and building
societies had consistently offered basic-rate taxpayers returns above the
rate of inflation throughout the period of her investment. The Mip had not
even come close to beating inflation.
With hindsight, it is easy to see how it happened. Mips rely on unit-linked
investments, and can switch between a variety of funds. This is an
attractive feature, particularly when the provider has as large a range of
funds as Save &amp; Prosper, because it allows investors to 'play the market'
and catch the areas of best growth at any time.
But it also makes mistakes easy. And after four years of mediocre
performance - in the wake of the Black Monday crash in October 1987 - April
1991 was not a good time to take the profits from a unit-linked investment.
On the advice of various different salesmen, Ms Vernelle's Mip switched from
the Global Equity fund, which had been doing well, to the Special Situations
fund in April 1988. This was a bad time to move into a speculative fund, and
it lost money. There was a later switch into European Growth, which also
lost money.
Other choices of fund could have delivered a better pay-out, but the advice
was not there. Eventually, having taken retirement earlier than she had
planned, she was advised to cut her losses and encash the policy - another
move which hindsight suggests would have been a mistake, as the market has
picked up in the past 18 months.
Ms Vernelle reported the case to the Consumers' Association, for its Worst
Buys of the Year study. Somewhat alarmingly, it was not the worst. This is
because this kind of case is all too common - many other people close to
retirement have been rushed into investments for tax reasons, and done
badly.
Jean Eaglesham, of the Consumers' Association, draws several conclusions
from the affair: 'One lesson is to try always to get the salesman's
recommendation in writing, and push them as hard as you can for the
conditions of their recommendations. If there's a good reason to go into it,
get that in writing if at all possible. Get any recommendation to be as
detailed as possible, and don't be frightened to go back to them.'
Such a 'reason why' letter from an adviser will become a legal requirement
if the new rules on disclosure advocated by the Securities and Investments
Board are adopted. The requirement seems to be overdue, as the CA has had
many cases of people who had relied on verbal recommendations, and could not
pin the company down for compensation when the advice turned out to be
wrong.
Fortunately, in this case there was a happy ending. After being contacted by
the FT, Mr Colin Rye, of Save &amp; Prosper's insurance division, said the
circumstances made it sufficiently clear that Ms Vernelle was planning to
surrender early that he was prepared to make an ex gratia refund of her
discontinuance charges, even though there was nothing in writing to prove
what she had been told. Ms Vernelle was very pleased about this, as it
belatedly makes up for one of her greatest problems with the product.
Ms Eaglesham adds: 'Don't assume that the salesmen are acting in your best
interest. It is worth going to them on the assumption that they are working
for themselves.'
Ms Vernelle's ultimate complaint, as she contemplates retirement on these
low savings, is that the full risks were never made clear. She says: 'I do
think that something which is as chancy as that is not a marvellous way of
saving for your future. Ten years ahead, it's a terrible gamble if your
savings depend on the value of the market on one particular day.'

Derivatives and other wheezes - Serious Riches / The latest venture in
Oliver Gillie's varied career sees him demonstrating his faith in those
reputedly risky hedging instruments, futures and options 'There are a lot of
sensible things that can be done with them,' he explains
</HEADLINE>

'I really feel I'm a confused child of the nineties who made some money in
the eighties and hasn't done much right in the last year or two, and isn't
quite sure where to go next.'
THE WORDS come from Oliver Gillie, a man whose varied career has stretched
from metal-bashing to estate agency to the more complicated world of
derivatives dealing. Some of his moves in the 1980s were spectacularly
well-timed, but now he is trying to think of something new to do.
His latest business venture was Derivatives Securities Ltd. The idea was
simple - he thought he could see a hole in the market for a 'respectable'
brokerage specialising in futures and options aimed at the 'retail', or
individual, customer. He also felt that demand for derivatives would
increase in the changed economic climate of the 1990s.
Trading in these instruments is dominated by big international securities
houses, which work mainly for pension funds and other large institutional
investors; and at the other end of the spectrum by small, allegedly
scandal-prone brokers. This side of the industry developed a bad reputation
for 'churning' - needlessly trading clients' funds to amass more commission.
Although much of this has been stamped out by regulators, the reputation
seems to stick.
Apart from these shenanigans, derivatives have a reputation as an
ultra-risky way to speculate. But they were originally developed as
instruments to manage and limit risk, rather than increase it.
Mr Gillie himself is a strong believer in derivatives, and trades in them on
his own account regularly.
'There are a lot of sensible things which can be done with derivatives,' he
said. 'The classic situation would have been in 1987. Two fund managers both
bought company X at Pounds 16. But one bought shares at Pounds 16 per share,
and the other bought options at Pounds 1 a throw. Then the market crashed,
and the share price fell to Pounds 11. Which was the speculator? It's a very
low-risk strategy, and it only becomes high-risk if you gear up.
'Another example is to buy shares and then sell options on the shares. What
you are in essence doing is giving yourself a larger chance of profit in
return for less chance of a large profit. I think that's a conservative
thing to do, and I suspect, in the difficult world of the 1990s, it may be
an essential thing to do.'
DSL started promisingly, but profitability has proved elusive, and in the
past few weeks Mr Gillie has sold all but 5 per cent of his investment to
new investors, for a loss. He is now confident of the company's future with
their backing.
It is not as if he has not had his fair share of luck in the past. A varied
career started with a degree in mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge,
in the early 1960s. From there he went into operational research with first
Esso and then RTZ.
His RTZ career left him as manager of a tin smelter in Yorkshire, a job from
which he was made redundant in 1975. Looking around for something new to do,
he encountered 'by pure coincidence', Amalgamated Metals, which traded in
tin from an office in Zug, Switzerland.
Mr Gillie says candidly that his sole qualification for the job was the
ability to spell the word 'tin', but this was enough to earn him a posting
to Switzerland. He was to stay there until 1982, trading in tin, nickel and
tin concentrates, and in the metals trading industry generally until 1985.
At this time, the metals market was livelier than it is now, and the
middleman was king. Mr Gillie had a great time. But by 1985, when he had
been trading in metals back in London for three years, he had had enough.
The role of the middleman was changing, and he felt it was time for a
change.
The route to rather more serious riches was offered by his wife, who had
been working in an estate agent's office in Stockwell, South London. The
firm was small, but she could see potential, and when the owner indicated
that he wanted to get out of the business, she expressed an interest. The
couple bought the estate agency, which they renamed Morgan Gillie, for what
with hindsight was an incredibly cheap price.
As it turned out, 1985 was a good time to buy an estate agency in London.
They soon expanded, opening branches in Clapham, Peckham and Dulwich, just
in time for the vast influx of young professionals seeking accommodation
close to the City. Prices in previously unfashionable areas of South London
soared.
The Black Monday stock market crash in October 1987 sounded a warning, and
at this point they started negotiations to sell Morgan Gillie. But the
negotiations dragged on, and meanwhile the housing market started to boom as
it had never boomed before. Then chancellor Nigel Lawson's announcement, in
the March budget of 1988, that double Miras relief for co-habiting couples
would be stopped at the end of July was an estate agents' dream.
On the last day of July, Morgan Gillie exchanged contracts on 25 houses.
The smartest move of all was to sell at the top. On August 8, Morgan Gillie
was sold to Cornerstone, Abbey National's chain of estate agents, for a
handsome profit. Mr and Mrs Gillie continued to work there for a year, and
then he moved on to derivatives broking.
If the estate agency was an example of being in the right place at the right
time, then Mr Gillie's membership of the troubled Gooda Walker catastrophe
reinsurance syndicate at Lloyd's might balance it. He had been introduced to
them by the Lime Street Names' Agency, which is now in receivership, and
they have proved to be one of the worst affected syndicates at Lloyd's. Mr
Gillie needed to write out a substantial cheque to Lloyd's last year.
But it could have been worse. In the run-up to the 1989 underwriting year,
the bills for which arrived last year, Lime Street recommended him to join
the new Feltrim syndicates, which also specialised in catastrophe stop-loss
insurance. These have done almost as badly as Gooda Walker.
However, Mr Gillie met an agent from Sedgwick and was persuaded out of this.
He stayed out of Feltrim, cut his exposure to Gooda Walker, and continues to
be a Name at Lloyd's, using Sedgwick, and not Lime Street, as his agent. In
the 1990 underwriting year, for which the bills arrive this year, he has no
exposure to the hard-hit reinsurance syndicates.
He has taken the troubles of the market with rather more equanimity than
other stricken Names. 'Names are very fully warned,' he says. 'I do think
that Lloyd's themselves were terrible sloppy and that some underwriters and
agents may have been negligent, maybe even criminally so. But just where
that gets us I'm not terribly sure.'
He is rather less relaxed about the UK's powerful fund-management industry,
to which he is offering an alternative with Derivatives Securities. He says:
'With a unit trust, you are paying 5 per cent up front for second-rate
management. In general it's underperformed the index, but it's been
operating at a time when everything's gone up. In a non-inflationary world,
I think they may turn out to be a real trap.'
He also eschewed the use of life assurance savings schemes for the school
fees of his two sons, saying that life offices by and large did an even
worse job of managing money than the unit trust industry.
As for pensions: 'I've got a few bits and bobs for pensions tucked away, but
I don't really want my money run for me by life companies, and I would like
to think the assets we've built up would provide us with a pension.'
For the time being, Mr and Mrs Gillie are devoting their energies to
charitable work, via a charity called Ashoka which sponsors 'social
entrepreneurs', or remarkable individuals in a range of 13 Third World
countries. Those helped include street children in Bombay and child
prostitutes in Brazil, but the aim is always to foster 'self help'.
One or two other plans are in the offing. Mr Gillie is not sure whether he
has another 'wheeze' in him, but the enthusiasm certainly seems to be there.
His investment philosophy makes it clear that the world will be a changed
place: 'If we have neither inflation nor growth, it's possible property may
continue to drop, and shares may be disappointing. It is clear that the old
rules no longer apply, so the future is a challenge.'

FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15):
Look abroad before you decide on gilts - Bonds / Foreign markets may offer
better prospects this year, with France currently a favourite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK RETAIL investors are currently being offered a plethora of unit trusts
investing in gilts.
These appear to be an attractive alternative to bank or building society
deposit accounts, following the recent fall in short-term rates and rise in
long-term sterling bond yields.
But sterling-based investors should examine other options before plumping
for the gilts market. Foreign bond markets may offer better prospects this
year, so unit trusts investing in international bonds rather than just gilts
should also be considered.
Although 10-year gilt yields of 8 1/2 per cent appear relatively attractive,
most analysts expect longer-dated gilt yields to edge higher, so investors
could do well to wait.
The main problem for the gilts market, for the foreseeable future, is
supply. The government's burgeoning funding needs translate into weekly
sales of gilts averaging more than Pounds 1bn this year.
The market may well have some support in the short-term: ahead of the start
of the new financial year in April, the funding position is well in hand,
and there is even some prospect of further short-term interest rate cuts.
But after that, the pressures of supply are likely to lead to a steepening
of the yield curve - that is, long-term yields will rise relative to
short-term rates.
In order to meet its funding needs, the UK government needs to be able to
attract foreign investment in gilts. But the UK's withdrawal from the
exchange rate mechanism has exacerbated fears about the pound's instability
among foreign investors.
Further, the returns available in the gilts market are not sufficiently
generous to tempt them away from other European markets with stronger
currencies. For example, current 10-year gilt yields of around 8 1/2 per
cent offer only  1/2 point more than 10-year French government bond yields,
while 10-year German bonds are yielding around 7 per cent.
Those differentials will have to widen in order to attract foreign
investors. Moreover, while other markets are expected to experience falling
yields, gilt yields are likely to rise: UBS predicts 10-year gilt yields of
9 per cent by the end of the year.
Away from the market's supply problems, there is very little good news in
the pipeline. The current decline in the inflation rate may give some
initial support to the index-linked sector, but that could well fade, as the
effects of sterling's devaluation, and the economy's expected emergence from
recession, take effect.
'Inflation will fall in the next few months, but could be as high as 3 1/2
per cent by the end of the year, so gains on index-linked gilts will be
relatively short-lived,' according to Mr Michael Burke, international
economist at Yamaichi International.
'The gilts market is facing a double whammy of rising inflation by the end
of the year and a deluge of supply,' he added. However, he suggested that
investors interested in income rather than total returns might want to pick
up the long-dated gilts when yields reach 9 1/2 per cent to 9 3/4 per cent.
But for investors looking for capital gains, Mr Michael Hughes, head of
economic research at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, suggests that there is a better
case for equities than for gilts.
However, he also suggested that some sterling corporate bonds may perform
well, as the economy emerges from recession, judging by the strong support
for smaller companies in the equity market.
Among foreign bond markets, the French market is currently a favourite.
Although the market has failed to take off so far this year, analysts remain
very positive about its prospects, based on strong economic fundamentals. It
is widely expected to outperform other European markets once the elections
in March are over.
Currently, the margin between 10-year French government bond and Bund yields
is around 90 basis points, and, according to Mr Burke of Yamaichi, this
could widen further (that is, France could underperform Germany) in the run
up to the elections.
But once that uncertainty is removed, France's relatively strong position,
relative to other European countries, should pay dividends. The French
market can boast low inflation, a current account surplus, and reasonable
economic growth (by European standards), and although the state of
government finances is deteriorating, they are still in a better position
than in the UK or Germany.
Meanwhile, the reduction in the German repo rate has lent support to the
franc, and reassured most investors that the worst of the pressure on the
French currency is over.
Even if, against expectations, the franc were to be devalued, this does not
imply substantial losses for sterling-based investors, because the franc is
not considered to be currently overvalued against sterling. In fact, since
leaving the ERM, sterling has benefited from the continuing turmoil within
the system, and most analysts say that, over the course of the year, the
franc is likely to appreciate against sterling.
The other market favoured by analysts is the US Treasury market, which also
combines the prospects of currency appreciation and stronger economic
fundamentals.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): A
humble investor is agreeably surprised - The portfolio, up 58 per cent in 15
months, has been helped by a number of cautious decisions, and by retaining
a hefty cash pile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM just a private investor. I have no access to company meetings with
analysts and direct company contacts. There are no computer experts,
marketmakers and economists suggesting and supporting my individual
investment decisions.
Yet, somewhat to my surprise, the portfolio I started with a notional Pounds
10,000 in the autumn of 1991 has now grown to Pounds 15,835 - an increase of
58 per cent in 15 months.
One of the reasons why I am surprised by the extent of its success is
because, when I was first asked to create a portfolio for the Review, it was
impressed upon me that I should adopt a somewhat cautious approach and not
be 'too speculative'. While I thought the good gains could be made over the
longer term, in the short term I believed a conservative portfolio might be
lacklustre.
However, I think the portfolio has been helped by a number of cautious
decisions: only investing in companies which it was thought were undervalued
and had solid assets; waiting for some of the target companies to fall in
price before making an investment; and not being over-dependent on any one
company for success, but retaining a rather hefty cash pile.
It was a sound, and cautious, approach that led to the portfolio investing
in Taveners, a UK confectionery firm. But the company was profitable, and I
thought that, at 70p, the shares were undervalued as several years earlier
the price had soared to 220p on takeover speculation.
When Fabrikker, a Danish company, took over Taveners last year it meant that
the portfolio's Pounds 2,450 investment in that company turned into Pounds
5,985 in cash.
It was caution which prevented the portfolio buying shares in Fisons at 356p
each. In last spring's quarterly review, I wondered if all the bad news
about the company had been discovered and released. The portfolio played
safe. Fisons then announced a downturn in profits and the shares slumped.
The portfolio eventually bought Fisons shares for 168p last August. The
shares are now 238p, helped by the company selling its consumer health care
businesses in the UK, US and Canada.
While Fisons still has some takeover attractions and the possibilities of a
jump in share price if the various new drugs gain US approval, the portfolio
will retain its cautious stance towards the company and will raise its 'stop
loss' limit (the price at which it will sell the shares) to 200p.
If the shares drop back again to the 160-70p level, then, depending on
prospects for the company and general stock market conditions, a further
purchase of Fisons' shares would be contemplated.
Another cautious purchase was Pentland group shares at 99p each. I have long
been impressed by the quality of Pentland's management, and my personal
pension scheme owns some Pentland shares.
While the company's greetings card division might have had a tough
Christmas, and a decline in interest rates must have some effect on
Pentland's cash pile of over Pounds 300m, I feel that some analysts have
underestimated Pentland's management. The shares are still good value at
127p taking a long-term view, as its Speedo swimwear division ought to be
progressing well. The portfolio will raise its 'stop loss' limit on Pentland
to 110p. If the shares subsequently fell back to 95p, then further purchases
will be considered.
Caution led to the purchase of shares in Burlington group at 11.5p each, as
the company had net assets worth more than its then share price. I warned,
however, that the shares should not be chased too far as, in the past, they
had tended to rise and fall rapidly. This proved to be sound advice. Soon
after the article was published, Burlington shares raced upwards and by
November were 17p.
If I had not written the article, I would have sold my personal pension
scheme's shares in Burlington at around that level expecting (as in the
past) to be able to buy them back again at much lower levels. I did not do
this as, being an ethical fellow, in the absence of any other news to
explain Burlington's share price rise, it might have looked as if I had
profited from 'talking up' Burlington.
Soon after reaching 17p, Burlington shares fell back to 13p before moving
smartly upwards again. Maybe the recent rise means that something is about
to happen at Burlington? I hope so. But in the absence of any bid rumours,
the portfolio will sell its Burlington shares if they reach 23p-25p, in the
hope of being able to buy them back again should they fall to around
12p-13p.
While caution sometimes pays, it can also hamper the quick acquisition of
profits. If the portfolio had invested Pounds 8,000 of its cash pile in
Burlington shares (instead of only Pounds 920), it would have turned that
sum into Pounds 13,217 at the recent peak of 19p.
Caution also prevented a profit being made on Allied Colloids, where the
portfolio was hoping the shares would fall from around 212p to 170p-180p.
The shares did not fall, but powered ahead to 245p. The portfolio will
continue to follow Allied Colloids, as more than 80 per cent of this
speciality chemical company's sales are to overseas customers so that it
ought to benefit from the pound's devaluation.
Although I am still expecting a general downturn in the UK and US stock
markets, which I consider to be currently at too-high levels for comfort, I
will raise the price at which the portfolio will be prepared to buy Allied
Colloid's shares to 200-210p.
While maintaining the portfolio's cautious stance, the heavy cash weighting
in times of comparatively low interest rate, is causing me some concern.
I feel that, if there is recovery to be achieved within the next 18 months
or so (and I still have some doubts), the strongly managed engineering
companies with sizeable overseas sales should be among the first to benefit
when a significant upturn occurs.
I particularly like Meggitt, which has a market capitalisation of Pounds
212m and in which BTR has an 18.2 per cent interest. If the shares fell to
75p-80p and looked as if they would not fall much further, the portfolio
would buy 2,000 of them.
Renishaw is a company involved in the design, manufacture and sale of
advanced precision metrology and inspection equipment. Over 90 per cent of
its sales are to overseas customers. If Renishaw's share price fell to
around 240p-250p, the portfolio would consider buying 1,000 of them.
Another engineering group with appeal is EIS group. If its shares fell back
to their 1992-3 low of 355p, then the portfolio would consider buying 750 of
them.
I also like William Ransom (in which my pension scheme has a small holding).
This company manufactures pharmaceutical products and appears to be well
managed. If the shares fell to around 40-45p, the portfolio would consider
buying 5,000.
All these potential purchases would take rather more than the cash available
in the portfolio, but I do not expect them all to fall within the limit set.
Some may well remain above the hoped-for purchase price. Which ones I do not
know, but at least the portfolio will be prepared.
The author of this feature, which commenced in the autumn 1991 issue of the
Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a Private
Investor column in the Weekend FT.  The Review invited him to suggest a
Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative.
The opinions expressed are his own.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11):
Nordic devaluations are balanced by strong stock market gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURMOIL IN the currency markets was the greatest influence on European
equity markets in the final quarter of 1992, but the countries forced to
devalue their currencies were consoled with the best-performing stock
markets.
According to the FT-A World Indices, Finland, which decided to let the
markka float in September, made the greatest gain in the quarter: 37.1 per
cent in local currency terms. Sweden, which followed Finland's lead in
November, came second with a rise of 33.4 per cent, and Italy came third
with a rise of 26.9 per cent. The gains in Finland and Sweden helped to
propel the Nordic index 21.9 per cent higher, compared with a gain of only
10.1 per cent for the whole of Europe.
Stock market analysts were not surprised by the extent of the gains,
triggered by the various currency devaluations, which in general led to an
improvement in the international competitiveness of countries whose
currencies have been devalued. In particular, Sweden is seen as a major
beneficiary of devaluation, because of its many international companies,
which have undergone extensive restructuring over the past two years.
However, Hoare Govett has advised clients to avoid Swedish companies with
the highest exposure to Germany, where the economy is expected to slow this
year, and concentrate instead on US-sensitive and cyclical stocks.
Towards the end of the year, continental markets were lifted by traditional
year-end rallies, fuelled by hopes of a recovery in the US economy and of a
cut in interest rates in Germany early in 1993. However, analysts warned at
the time that these hopes must be countered by signs of deteriorating
earnings growth on the continent and danger signals from Germany about its
economy.
Fear of economic recession, and profit warnings from the corporate sector,
contributed to the lacklustre performance of the German market in the final
quarter. It rose only 4.2 per cent in local currency terms. During the whole
year it lost 5.3 per cent but, in sterling terms, it rose 9.6 per cent, due
to the strength of the Deutsche Mark and the pound's weakness.
Kleinwort Benson underweighted Germany in its recommended asset allocation
for 1993, given what it called the appalling outlook for earnings. In its
view, both macro forecasts for the economy and micro forecasts for
individual companies were still far too high. Furthermore, the longer the
Bundesbank kept interest rates high, the harder the inevitable revaluation
of the D-Mark would hit the earnings outlook.
France, on the other hand, should be the main beneficiary if the Bundesbank
cuts interest rates, because this would take pressure off the franc and pave
the way for lower interest rates in France. Hoare Govett recommended an
overweight position in French equities for 1993, given its above-average GDP
growth (1.5 per cent in 1993, compared with 1.2 per cent for the
Netherlands, 1.0 per cent for Spain, 0.8 per cent for Switzerland and a fall
of 0.8 per cent in Germany) and low inflation.
Switzerland, the best performer in Europe in 1992 with a rise of 21.8 per
cent in local currency terms, is also expected to do well in 1993. In
December, Goldman Sachs believed there was scope for an earnings
growth-driven rise in the Swiss index of between 12 and 13 per cent over the
coming 10-to-14 months, and that equities should outperform both bonds and
cash.
Strategists at SG Warburg offered some words of caution regarding
continental European equities in 1993, which they believed would be largely
held back by deteriorating earnings growth prospects. 'We believe that
earnings momentum, rather than interest rates, holds the key to performance
in Europe (historically this has certainly been the case),' the broker said
in its 1993 asset allocation outlook.

Caution urged as the China factor continues to unsettle Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PACIFIC rim stock markets saw mixed results in the last quarter, with the
weakness in Japan offsetting rises in the markets of south-east Asia, which
remains one of the few areas showing firm economic growth.
While investors who placed funds in the Hong Kong market at the beginning of
October saw a 2.7 per cent fall in dollar terms, the market has been one of
the best-performing on a year-on-year basis, with the FT-A World Index for
Hong Kong rising 25.4 per cent.
The China factor continued to cause volatility on the Hong Kong stock market
during the quarter. The Hang Seng index rose to an all-time high of 6,447.11
in November, on hopes of economic benefits flowing from China's embrace of
market economics.
However, proposals by Mr Chris Patten, the governor, for greater democracy
in the colony after its reversion to Chinese sovereignty angered Beijing,
which in December warned that it would not honour contracts made by the Hong
Kong government with other parties which had not been approved by China.
The Hang Seng has managed to come off the 4,950 level, its December low, and
China has tried to assure investors by announcing that it would honour
contracts which span the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997. But
uncertainty over the political situation still looms over the market.
At the beginning of the year, the Chinese government, while maintaining an
uncompromising opposition to Mr Patten's plans, said obligations would be
honoured. Hong Kong now awaits debates over Mr Patten's proposals in
mid-February, and whatever the outcome, promises more volatility on the
stock market. Mr Philip Mok, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Hong
Kong, advises investors to remain on the sidelines for the time being,
although he expects a positive resolution in the next six months.
Japan's 3.5 per cent fall dragged the dollar-based Pacific Basin index of
FT-Actuaries down 2.9 per cent on the quarter. Excluding Japan, the region
gained 1 per cent. The Tokyo market gained briefly after the Japanese
government implemented emergency measures to restore confidence in the
market in August, but later slowly lost ground on faltering volume.
Most investors are reluctant to commit funds to the stock market as a bottom
for the economy has yet to be seen. Corporate earnings are expected to fall
as much as 30 per cent for the current year ending March, and the government
revised downwards its annual economic growth forecast to 1.6 per cent,
refusing to project the timing of a rebound.
Fears linger that Japan may have not yet have seen the worst, with some
analysts predicting a sharp deterioration of confidence in the country's
ailing banking sector this quarter. Financial authorities are expected to
revive a directive, issued last August, preventing banks from selling stocks
to realise profits ahead of the March year-end book closing.
Investors may be well off staying clear of the Tokyo market this quarter,
as, in spite of brief euphoria over the crown prince's engagement during the
first week of trading this month, Japanese stocks have dwindled on low
investor interest, and have seemed to set the mood for the time being.
Meanwhile, the Australian stock market saw dull trading amid uncertainty
over
the continuing weakness of the economy and a fall in demand from overseas
investors. The FT-Actuaries index rose a mere 0.7 per cent on the quarter,
while falling 16.4 per cent from the previous year.
Malaysia gained 4.5 per cent as the country's 1993 budget, reflecting the
government's commitment to align fiscal policy with monetary policy to check
inflation, encouraged investor sentiment.

Small stocks steal the limelight in an 'anaemic' US recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIG story of the final quarter of 1992 was small stocks - which put in a
strong performance while much of the rest of the US equity markets stood
virtually still.
Between October and the end of December, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
managed a paltry 0.9 per cent gain, to end the year at 3,271.66. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fared a little better, rising 4.3 per cent to 435.72,
but it was the Nasdaq composite index of secondary stocks, the main measure
of small stock performance, which grabbed the spotlight, soaring 16 per cent
during the quarter to 676.95.
Although the Nasdaq was aided by exceptional gains from a few big technology
stocks, such as Intel and Microsoft, the main reason the index did so well
was because small company stocks were in heavy demand from investors. They
offered what cyclical and leading industrial stocks did not: an opportunity
for growth.
Bigger stocks fell victim to the economic circumstances. Although there were
an increasing number of signs during the latter stages of the period that
economic growth was finally picking up pace, the recovery remained (in
President Bush's words) 'anaemic' throughout the second half of 1992.
Consequently, many investors who had bought cyclical stocks in the early
part of the year, in expectation of a strong economic rebound in late 1992,
began switching during the last quarter into smaller stocks, which had
fallen sharply in the spring and summer and which were beginning to look
inexpensive by the autumn.
The early stages of the final quarter was a particularly difficult period
for some of the Dow's most prestigious stocks. IBM, Merck, Westinghouse and
United Technologies reported disappointing third-quarter earnings, while
General Motors was plagued by turmoil among senior management and seemingly
never-ending restructurings.
The presidential election, meanwhile, was nearing its conclusion.
Ultimately, it had little real impact on stock prices, primarily because the
proposed economic policies of Bill Clinton did not frighten investors. By
election day, a Democratic victory had been priced into the markets.
Investors even welcomed some of his plans for boosting the economy with
increased government spending, although talk of introducing an aggressive
fiscal stimuli package in early 1993 sent chills through the bond market,
which was worried about the ballooning federal deficit and a possible
revival of inflation.
These concerns, however, did not particularly trouble the equity markets,
which by the final weeks of the quarter were posting sold gains in the wake
of a string of moderately positive economic reports. A mini post-election
boom in consumer confidence also gave stocks a modest lift.
Throughout the quarter, the markets were buoyed by heavy inflows of cash
into equities, which helped keep daily trading volume exceptionally heavy. A
record Dollars 9.9bn went into stock mutual funds during November alone as
investors continued to look to equities for higher returns.
In Canada, the Toronto Stock Exchange composite index ended a bad year on an
upbeat note, rising 1.6 per cent in the final quarter to end at 3,350.44.
Sentiment
was helped by the voters' decision to reject the government's plan to
include Quebec in a new Canadian constitution, and by the improving economic
outlook.
Concern about the slowing economy and higher interest rates failed to
unsettle equity investors in Mexico, where they celebrated the signing of
the North American Free Trade Agreement in late December by helping the
Bolsa index jump 32.5 per cent to 1,759.44.

London puts optimism on hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH ECONOMIC recession still hung over the Christmas festivities,
equity market indices stood at record levels on New Year's Eve, with UK
stocks having outperformed against both the rest of Europe and the rest of
the world.
Share prices rose sharply in significantly increased trading volume as fund
managers took in the full implications of sterling's somewhat hasty
departure from the ERM network in mid-September. By the end of the year, the
pound had been devalued by nearly 5 per cent on the sterling exchange rate
index, offering a powerful boost to export sales prospects.
In November, the autumn economic statement from Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor
of the exchequer, put some teeth into the government's stated policy of
re-stimulating economic growth. Domestic interest rates were cut by one
point to 7 per cent, and there were measures to help car sales and the
battered homebuilding sector.
Investors responded readily, setting aside doubts about sterling's prospects
outside the ERM or, indeed, the wider question of whether either the UK or
other leading world economies could be rescued from recession so easily.
All equity sectors showed positive returns over the final quarter, noted
NatWest Securities - even the badly-battered building sectors, which brushed
aside their setbacks in the previous quarter.
Investors hastened to switch portfolios into the cyclical stocks likely to
lead the way into recovery (motors, hotels and leisure, and food
manufacturers), and out of the defensive stocks into which they had flocked
in the third quarter (pharmaceuticals, utilities, and selected financials).
Faith in a consumer-led recovery revived, and store and other retail issues
began to anticipate a good Christmas trade. Even the sorely-hurt property
sector turned in a return of 19.3 per cent, against minus 12.9 in the
preceding three months.
Investors in the UK market also took a benign view of developments
elsewhere. Signs of recovery in the US economy were eagerly received in
London. From their new position outside the ERM, UK investors saw pressures
on other member currencies - in particular, the French franc  - as a further
indication that Britain had merely anticipated moves to lower interest rates
across Europe. By the year-end, London was convinced that a cut in German
rates was not far away.
A final flourish of optimism in December took market indices to new peaks,
leaving the FT-SE All-Share Index with a total return of 14 per cent on the
quarter. This outstripped the 12.7 per cent return on the narrower FT-SE 100
Share Index, as investors moved towards the second-tier issues where
potential gains are greater when the economy recovers.
The move towards smaller stocks remained a feature as the market moved into
the new year, when the FT-SE Mid 250 Index reached new peaks, although the
FT-SE 100 was slipping back.
These trends must be measured against a substantial increase in retail
trading in equities - retail business is the genuine outside customer
interest. Retail business averaged more than Pounds 1bn daily during the
final quarter, indicating a return to profitable trading levels for the
London securities industry as well as a convincing level of investment in
equities.
Confidence remained high as the final quarter of 1992 passed into history,
although many strategists warned that the market had run too far in
December, and that equity valuations of around 17 times historic earnings
were probably too high. In the short term, equities can expect a further
one-point cut in UK base rates, but this will probably be the last rate cut
in this cycle.
Economic recovery could still prove elusive, and inflation the more likely
reality. Equities face pressure both from government funding and from
looming rights issues. And there are already fears that Mr Lamont's budget,
due in March, may bring higher taxes.

Out of the ERM and into clover - Sterling-based investors had a splendid
final quarter. For UK fund managers and internationally-minded retail
investors, the great escape came with Black Wednesday, which led to a very
happy new year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WHAT A difference currency changes can make]
Sterling-based investors had a field day in the last quarter of 1992. The 24
markets making up the FT-Actuaries World Indices produced a combined total
return of almost 18 per cent; profits for the US dollar investor were zero.
Total return for the UK itself was some 14 per cent, but the market was also
a lossmaker for American funds investing in Britain.
For UK fund managers and internationally-minded retail investors, the great
escape came with Black Wednesday, when sterling quit the ERM, interest rates
and the value of the pound dropped sharply and equities powered ahead. The
total return on the UK subset of the World Index was a negative 2.3 per cent
in the year to September 16; in the three-and-a-half months to year-end, the
outcome was some 23 per cent and a very happy new year indeed for most fund
managers.
The story, but again only for sterling holders, was much the same across the
investment world. Total return on the 2,200-plus components of the World
Index to the middle of September was a negative 3 per cent; over the
remaining 15 trading weeks of the year the return was over 20 per cent
positive. Europe excluding the UK was 15.5 per cent; the Pacific region
excluding Japan saw almost 20 per cent. Towards the end of December, London,
New York and Tokyo all hit their high point of a turbulent investment year
on most exchanges, although the US stock market was uncharacteristically
rock steady throughout 1992.
Dollar investors across the 520-odd US stocks in the index had a
last-quarter return of 5.3 per cent, against a virtual standstill outcome
for the narrow Dow, but they had a poor time in Europe, excluding Finland
and Italy, and had hefty losses in Austria, Denmark, Germany and France.
However, the global dollar portfolio got a huge 35 per cent return in
Mexico.
The Japanese market, still a major headache for many UK fund managers who
bought it expensively at the start of 1992 (or late the previous year), went
nowhere in the final quarter in local terms, but sterling investors who got
their timing right had an almost 14 per cent total return. The small Irish
market showed a higher than 7 per cent local return in the October-December
period, despite a strong currency and high interest rates.
But if timing was of the essence in some markets, sector (as against
all-important stock) selection was less vital in the last quarter. No sector
in the World Index produced a negative return, and many showed impressive
gains: banks, utilities, media, electronics, retail and forestry/paper
produced returns better than 20 per cent, with automobiles and chemicals at
16 and 14 respectively. Precious metals just managed it into positive
territory.
And the immediate future? Uncertain. Money market rates are headed
downwards, at least for the moment, and the retail investor needs to take
some calculated chances elsewhere.
Pension funds have their long-term liabilities to match, so they have little
option other than a sizeable holding in equities, although the balance in
favour of international bonds may be changing, European economic conversion
or not.
The Clinton White House should see some enhanced US economic activity - the
year-end signs were already encouraging - but immediate equity prospects in
continental Europe and Japan may not be great. UK companies with heavy US
exposure (and there are many in the big league) will benefit from growth in
the American economy, but more competitive export prices may run up against
recessions in many traditional British markets.
France could be a buy in the medium term, subject to a small currency risk,
and also some of the Pacific Basin markets. Smaller companies in economies
coming out of recession, notably the US, were showing healthy signs early on
this year. Stock-picking could be a short term imperative.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): A
safety-net may mean that the show is less spectacular Guaranteed Products -
Loss of capital is the saver's biggest fear, and a range of equity-based
products, devised to counteract this understandable nervousness, promises
you your money back. But you can't get something for nothing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been hard to persuade cautious British investors to buy shares,
except where they are offered a 'one-way bet' as with the privatisation
issues.
Loss of capital is the British saver's biggest fear, and the crash of 1987
still looms large in investors' memories as an example of the stock market's
volatility.
Now, a new generation of savings products has been devised, with the aim of
counteracting this understandable nervousness. Guaranteed products offer an
equity-based investment, with a promise of your money back.
Many are based on the options and futures market. The bulk of the fund is
invested in fixed-interest securities which grow so that the capital can be
paid back. The rest goes into options and futures, in order to provide
exposure to the equity market. A typical product will offer the rise in the
FT-SE 100 index over five years, or your original investment, whichever is
the greater.
Countless variations can be played on this basic structure in order to
provide products which appeal to different types of investor. For example,
rises in the market can be 'locked in', to avoid the danger of a sharp fall
in share prices at the end of the investment period.
Sensible investors realise that they should place their savings in the stock
market, if they want the best long-term returns. A guaranteed bond would
therefore seem to be an ideal way of enjoying equity-style profits, at
little risk. But these products are rarely flawless. The most common
limitations are:
Fixed investment periods. Most products have to be held for five years for
the guarantee to apply, and are only on offer for a limited period
(accordingly, some of those mentioned in this article are no longer
available for investment). Those who withdraw early may face extra charges,
and returns will depend on the market level at the time of the withdrawal.
There are exceptions, however. Abbey Life's Protected Growth Bond, for
example, offers year-on-year protection unless world stock markets fall by
an average of 16 per cent. Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's Capital Protected Plus
offers guarantees on a quarterly basis, with withdrawals possible at the end
of each three month period.
Lack of income. Most products pay no income at all; nor do they match the
dividend yield on the index, an important component of equity returns. Thus
performance would lag behind an index-tracking unit trust over five years.
Again, some products have proved exceptions to the rule. Scottish Amicable,
for example, offered a yield-inclusive return on its Capital Guarantee Bond,
although this was partly offset by high charges.
Tax. Many products are insurance bonds, with the result that they fall under
the income tax regime. Basic rate tax is deducted by the company.
Higher-rate taxpayers may face a further charge (the difference between
basic rate and top rate tax on encashment), although there is the
possibility of using top-slicing relief.
Most equity products normally offer the bulk of their return in the form of
capital gain, and since most people do not use up their annual CGT allowance
(Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93), a conventional unit or investment trust will
normally be more tax-efficient than a guaranteed product, especially for a
higher-rate taxpayer.
The problem of providing a 'rolling guarantee' has made it difficult for
unit and investments trusts to offer a cash-back promise. However, Legal &amp;
General has produced a personal equity plan, based on its Recovery unit
trust. If the value of your Pep has fallen over five years, Legal &amp; General
will send you a cheque to make up the difference. The product is therefore
highly tax-efficient; however, the Recovery trust is not an indexed fund,
and there is always the risk that the investment performance could
substantially underperform the market.
Charges. Indexed unit trusts often have quite low front-end and annual
charges. But guaranteed products tend to have bid-offer spreads in line with
the bulk of the unit trust/insurance industry - at around 5 per cent.
Since it is normally the bid price of the units which is indexed, this means
that, on most guaranteed products, indexation only applies to around 95 per
cent of your money.
Inflation. Most products promise to repay your initial capital after five
years. But this takes no account of the effect of inflation on the
purchasing power of the investor's money.
Some products promise slightly more than your capital back after five years,
but usually compensate by offering less than 100 per cent of the index's
rise.
Confusing claims. Some companies have offered products which offer to beat
the performance of the FT-SE 100 index. However, this may be a mirage;
Laurentian Life, for example, promised 115 per cent of the Footsie's rise.
But this figure is before tax, which is automatically deducted, which means
that investors will not, in practice, receive this rise.
The guarantee is only as good as the company which is offering it. While
this is not much of a problem in many cases, because most products are sold
by the UK's biggest insurance groups, it is worth remembering when
considering an offer from a little-known company.
To sum up, you cannot get something for nothing. Investors have to make some
sort of sacrifice in order to get the guarantee, whether it is lack of
income, flexibility, or tax inefficiency.
Sophisticated investors may find these products unnecessary. If they believe
the market will rise over the next five years, they should consider a
low-charging index unit trust such as Gartmore's; if they feel the market is
set to fall, they should avoid equities altogether and stick to gilts or the
building society.
That said, there are many British investors who will only be tempted into
equities by a money-back guarantee. These products may well prove one of the
financial services growth areas of the 1990s.

When the mortgage exceeds income - The Plowshares / Alison is worried about
a friend whose husband is redundant, and there seems no easy solution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BEVERLY CHANDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S HALF past three in the morning, and John has awoken to discover that
Alison is not sound asleep as he would have expected, but sitting downstairs
in the kitchen, disconsolately drinking a cup of tea.
Insomnia has never been a feature of the Plowshares' lives: all pride
themselves on the ability to sleep eight hours, regardless of mental or
physical discomfort. So John knows that all is not well.
'What's on your mind?' he asks, as he refills the tea-pot.
'I'm really sorry to have disturbed you as well,' says Alison. 'I know it's
ridiculous, but I'm worrying about Carol at work.'
As John pours himself a cup of tea and settles down, the story comes out.
Carol, like Alison, is a part-time receptionist at the local GP's surgery.
Although, on the whole, this is, a fulfilling and enjoyable job, it does not
pay terribly well. In fact it pays rather badly - roughly Pounds 5,000 a
year for 20 hours a week.
Despite this, all was well until two months ago when Carol's husband George
lost his much better-paid job as an accountant with a small building company
that had hit hard times.
During the more affluent days of the late 1980s, Carol and George had
expanded their lifestyle rather ambitiously, taking on a large house and a
correspondingly large mortgage.
With George's redundancy, Carol has found herself the sole breadwinner, and
with the loss of his salary, they have inevitably not been able to keep up
their mortgage payments.
Carol arrived at work one morning the previous week, clearly upset. She
confessed to Alison that she had not been opening the letters that were
beginning to arrive from the couple's mortgage lenders; while George had
become extremely depressed and was apparently unable to deal with the
situation.
'I just feel so ill-equipped to help,' Alison tells John, mournfully.
'There's that awful feeling of 'there but for the grace of God go I', and I
would like to do something practical to help, but Lord knows what.'
John is certain that something can be done, but equally certain that it
cannot be done at four o'clock in the morning. He suggests that, during the
day, Alison encourage Carol to visit either the Citizen's Advice Bureau or
some sort of independent debt counsellor or money adviser.
Several days later, Alison greets John, as he arrives home from work, with
the details of her visit with Carol to an independent money adviser,
Patricia Cook, at the local town hall.
'We may not have helped sort out Carol and George's problems completely, but
we have reduced them to manageable piles, which can then be sorted out,'
explains Alison.
'According to Patricia, the first thing to do if you find that you can't pay
your mortgage is to talk to the mortgage lender.' In a glorious mix of
metaphors, Alison explains that you can't sweep debt problems under the
carpet, play ostrich and expect them to go away: 'You must face up to them,'
she adds, explaining that mortgage lenders, confronted with the growing
problem of people having difficulties meeting repayments, are keen to help
their borrowers who are in difficulties.
'These days, mortgage lenders are as sympathetic as they can commercially
afford to be,' says Alison.
The next thing to do is to analyse what money is coming in and, based upon
that, determine what entitlement to state benefits there may be, and whether
a tax rebate may be due following the redundancy itself.
Unfortunately, even though Carol's earnings are so low, she works more than
16 hours a week - 20, like Alison - so that the family is not eligible for
income support.
'Do you realise that Carol falls into the 'poverty trap' and could actually
be better off not working?' says Alison, as she starts to prepare supper.
'If she worked less than 16 hours a week, the state would contribute towards
the interest on her and George's mortgage.'
There is also a big question-mark over whether Carol and George may be
eligible for one of the new types of mortgage-to-rent scheme. There is no
national scheme, Carol has discovered, only schemes set up by individual
lenders. These range from simple systems where you pay what you can afford,
in the hope of finding more income or being able to sell the property, to a
scheme where the lender, working through a housing association, takes over
your property and then lets it back to you. This turns the former owner into
a tenant, which can make him more eligible for state benefits.
The problem with this type of scheme is that the eligibility criteria are
very tight. And again, the fact that Carol is still working may make the
couple unsuitable.
But another sound piece of advice from Patricia Cook is to prioritise debts.
'Did you know,' asks Alison, 'that if you don't pay your mortgage, you could
lose your home, which is bad enough. But if you don't pay your poll tax, you
could go to prison. So you need to be certain which debts have the greatest
priority for payment and pay them in that order.'
Alison reports that, at the end of a rather trying meeting, Carol had felt
reassured that positive steps could be taken to sort out her family's
problems before they got more out of hand. George was now applying for a tax
rebate, and he and Carol were trying to decide whether it would be better
for her to give up her job over the short-term and get state aid towards the
mortgage, or to wait in expectation of George's finding work soon.
Having done something constructive to help her friend, Alison looks forward
to a good night's sleep.

Repayments', free of charge, by sending a stamped addressed envelope to the

John, who is 50, is a partner in an architectural practice and earned Pounds
50,000 last year. His wife Alison, in her late forties, has a part-time job
as a receptionist for the local GP. The Plowshares have two children: Lucy,
who is 21 and at university in the Midlands; and Toby, 18, who has just left
school. Following the deaths of John's parents and his subsequent
inheritance, the Plowshares have a portfolio of unit trusts, a personal
equity plan each and some rainy-day money in a building society.

Not quite as safe as houses - The Tax Deadline 4, The Business Expansion
Scheme / Property is likely to make most sense. But take independent advice,
and be sure the BES suits your overall tax plan and investment philosophy
</HEADLINE>

NO INVESTMENT is quite so tightly tied to the end of the tax year as the
Business Expansion Scheme.
Each year at about this time, a rash of glossy prospectuses offers
opportunities for the wealthy to reclaim some of their tax. That is not
going to change.
But much else connected with the scheme has changed utterly since it was
first introduced as the Business Start-up Scheme in 1981. Last year's budget
set a definite timetable for its demise - it will end on December 31 this
year.
The idea is to encourage higher-rate (or to a lesser extent basic-rate)
taxpayers to invest in high-risk speculative ventures, and in residential
property which is available for assured-tenancy letting. The latter has come
to dominate the sector almost totally, because the risk involved is lower.
If a sponsor wants to attract investment through the BES, it is necessary to
set up a company. Tax relief at the investor's top marginal rate is then
payable on investment in shares in the company. The maximum which can be
raised through a property BES is Pounds 5m, and for trading companies the
figure is only Pounds 750,000.
Each investor may put a maximum of Pounds 40,000 per tax year into the BES.
This can be spread over any number of companies.
The company should then send out BES3 forms, with which tax relief can be
claimed from the Inland Revenue. So, having invested Pounds 40,000, a
top-rate taxpayer would receive 40 per cent of this, Pounds 16,000, back
from the Revenue, making an effective investment of only Pounds 24,000.
Tax relief is forfeited if the shares are sold within five years, or if the
company fails to continue a business which qualifies for BES relief during
this time. This most often happens if the company collapses altogether, but
could also occur if a property company breached assured tenancy rules. The
idea is that you are locked in for five years.
This is extremely tax-efficient. But tax-efficiency, while desirable, is not
a sufficient reason to make an investment. Early BES companies had a
distressing habit of going bust, leaving investors with a stiff loss. The
fact that it was tax-efficient was of little consolation.
An 'entrepreneurial' BES could make big profits. But a decision to invest in
one would be far beyond the normal bounds of personal finance. If you know
and trust the management, or believe the company has a particularly strong
chance of success, then it is a good home for 'risk' money you are prepared
to lose.
For the majority, the lowest-risk schemes are the most appealing. And the
sponsors who put these packages together have now managed to squeeze most of
the risk out of them.
First came the 'buy-back'. A BES company would buy property on behalf of a
university or housing association, which would then covenant to buy it back
at a fixed price at the end of the five-year period. Initially, prices of
Pounds 1.40 at the end of five years for every Pounds 1 share were on offer
 -a great deal given that the shares would effectively have cost 60p each.
However, the 'guarantees' on offer were flimsy, as they were only as strong
as the guarantor bodies. Neither universities nor housing associations could
be regarded as fiscally strong.
But last year, sponsors at last found clearing banks prepared to underwrite
the guarantees. This cuts the amount of money on offer - following the
latest round of base rate cuts, the price from some companies has been only
Pounds 1.08 after five years - but reduces the risk.
Now, the banks are also prepared to offer 'non-recourse loans' after six
months. These are secured only on the value of the BES shares themselves -
they have no right to pursue any of your other assets, meaning that you can
effectively walk away from the investment after six months. Thanks to the
gearing provided by the tax relief you can do so for a big profit. The
standard rate from schemes so far has been 72p for every Pounds 1 spent. On
an after-tax investment of 60p, after only six months, this is impressive,
and interest in non-recourse schemes has been intense.
As the tax-year end approaches, the sales pressure will intensify. How do
you handle it?
The golden rules are to use independent advice, and make sure that the BES
fits with your overall tax plans and investment philosophy. Unless you can
genuinely afford to take risks, the various forms of guaranteed property
scheme must make the most sense.
If liquidity is important, and many people do not want to lock in for five
years, then the non-recourse loans are attractive. However, those who can
wait for five years will get better value. As Allenbridge Group points out,
the cost of funds on a non-recourse loan is about 9.8 per cent.
In other words, you will only gain on this option, compared with staying in
for the five years, if you can reinvest the money somewhere which will earn
9.8 per cent - a slightly optimistic assumption. The highest rates over five
years may come from companies which do not offer non-recourse loans.
Always look at the strength of the covenant, and avoid operators new to the
market. Several companies now have extensive experience of the market.
Once you have worked out what you want, try to invest in a scheme which
provides it. BES companies tend to sell out in an unseemly rush, but the
heavy supply provided by the UK's housing market should ensure that all
those for whom the BES is an appropriate investment can find an adequate
scheme.

EQUITIES HAVE started to show their attractions again. The table indicates
that many of those investors who opted for unit and investment trusts in
1992 did better than those who stuck with the building society.
Over the year, the average gain among the international investment trusts,
for example, was 22.3 per cent. That gain was helped by sterling's dramatic
depreciation after Black Wednesday.
But even in Britain, the average UK general unit trust rose 11.1 per cent.
That return is effectively net, because basic-rate tax is deducted at source
from dividends and few investors pay capital gains tax. Building society
investors will have done well to earn more than about 7 per cent net over
the entire year (based on Halifax BS figures).
Glancing at the tables, 11 of the 14 unit trust sectors would have beaten
the building society return, as would 10 of the 13 investment trust sectors.
And looking back five years, any investors who were bold enough to buy
trusts in January 1988 (right after the crash) will have made some very
healthy profits: Pounds 1,000 invested in Foreign &amp; Colonial, the largest
investment trust, would have turned into Pounds 2,559; the same sum in the
Newton Income unit trust would have become Pounds 2,003.
The biggest gains were obtainable in the Far Eastern markets. Oriental
investment trusts which exclude Japan have shown an average rise of 44 per
cent over one year and 186 per cent over five; among unit trusts, the
equivalent figures are 36 per cent and 181 per cent.
Whether investors will be lured into buying trusts by these performance
figures is a difficult question. Many will have bad memories of having
bought at the top of the market in 1987, and may be cautious about buying
into equities at a time when the UK stock market is hovering around an
all-time high (in nominal terms, at least).
On the other hand, with returns on building societies now down to meagre
levels, a higher-rate taxpayer can enjoy a better income from some unit and
investment trust Peps than from cash. In the US, low interest rates have
caused many investors to switch from cash to shares; perhaps their
transatlantic cousins will follow suit.
Those who like 'bottom-fishing' may be lured by the disappointing returns
achieved in the smaller companies sector, where investor hopes were high in
1987. Smaller company shares underperformed in each of the years 1989-92.
Some day they will recover, and unit and investment trusts will be the best
way for small investors to take advantage.
Many commentators are confident that the smaller companies revival will
occur in 1993. Mind you, they said that about 1992 as well.

Four new funds will seek to offer stability - Unit Trusts / Futures and
options will be used to reduce the risk. But will the average investor find
it easy to understand what they actually do?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
REDUCING THE risk of equity investment may prove one of the themes of the
1990s.
Guaranteed funds (discussed on page 11 of this Review) are one approach, but
an alternative was launched by Fidelity - a futures and options fund.
Futures and options have a rather racy reputation, but they are frequently
used to reduce risk. In effect, they can be a form of insurance against a
sharp fall in a particular market.
That is the aim of four new 'stabiliser growth' unit trusts from Fidelity,
based on the UK, American, European and Japanese markets. An investor's
money will not rise as fast as the index in a bull market, but it will not
fall as quickly in a bear market. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000,
with an initial charge of 5.25 per cent and an annual charge of 1.5 per
cent.
But the marketing flaw in these products is that the investor does not know
what his 'maximum loss' will be. If the market fell 50 per cent, Fidelity's
fund might fall, say, 15 per cent, and that is a risk that many cautious
investors will not accept. Nor will the average investor find it easy to
understand what a futures and options fund actually does.
So although these funds are more tax efficient than many guaranteed funds,
it is hard to see them taking off in the UK. Fidelity may have to prove the
concept through years of successful operation.
THE INCOME FACTOR
LOWER INTEREST rates and the unpredictability of investment returns have led
to a greater emphasis on income among managers currently launching
investment vehicles.
M &amp; G says its Managed Income Trust is aimed at the large number of people
who have difficulty with their choice of unit trust. Designed as a fund of
funds, to invest in the range of M &amp; G unit trusts, the Managed Income Trust
will hold a varying proportion of its portfolio in fixed-interest securities
and gilts, up to a maximum of 40 per cent.
Fund manager Chris Whitaker , who joined M &amp; G from County NatWest in 1991,
said the initial breakdown of investments would be around 20 per cent in
fixed interest securities, predominantly gilts, with a small proportion of
cash: possibly 5 per cent either directly in cash or in the M &amp; G Treasury
fund launched this month (see below).
About 55 per cent of the fund would be spread across the group's UK unit
trusts, with the balance going into a basket of funds invested in Europe,
the Far East and internationally.
Recognising that market movements before February might make a change of
strategy necessary, Mr Whitaker said M &amp; G saw the UK market as still having
some upside, though the pre-Christmas run-up in the market seemed to have
removed some of the potential for a traditional new year rally.
M &amp; G's Managed Income Trust will pay monthly income, at an estimated rate
of about 5 per cent gross annually if the fund is held via a personal equity
plan. Charges will be an initial 4.5 per cent and an annual 1.5 per cent,
with no additional charges on the unit trusts held by the fund.
The trust will be available at a fixed price of 25p per unit during the
launch period, which runs from February 6 to February 26, and the minimum
investment will be either Pounds 1,000 or Pounds 50 a month.
FUND WITH A CHEQUEBOOK
UNIT TRUSTS are showing further signs of adapting to an era in which
investors are looking for alternatives to the building society.
M&amp;G's new Treasury fund, by investing in UK Treasury bills and other
money-market instruments, aims to offer a yield higher than that obtainable
from most building society instant access accounts. Income will be payable
monthly, and investors will be given a chequebook, allowing them to transfer
funds (subject to a minimum of Pounds 250) into a bank or building society
account.
There is no initial charge, but an annual fee of 0.6 per cent; the minimum
investment is Pounds 5,000.
Such funds are relatively commonplace in the US; and, indeed, the most
obvious competitor in the UK is the cash account operated by the US group
Fidelity.
Money market funds are never likely to offer the best possible rate in the
market, but are sure to provide a rate which is highly competitive.
In contrast, some building society accounts offer a top-of-the-range
interest rate to attract investors, only to lower rates to below-market
levels after a year or so. All too often, inertia (or ignorance about the
rate change) stops investors from moving their money at the right time.
Eventually, such funds may offer the ability to make standing orders and
even cashpoint withdrawals. But, although the Fidelity fund has now topped
Pounds 100m, UK money market funds are simply not yet big enough to make
such services profitable at the low level of fees charged.
AN EASIER ROUTE INTO PIBS
PERMANENT INTEREST-bearing securities have many attractions for investors in
the current world of low rates. Pibs offer a high, fixed income and come
with the backing of building society names which most investors can
recognise.
The problem is that the market is illiquid, and some Pibs come in large
(Pounds 50,000) denominations. Holders of securities will rank well behind
depositors in the queue for repayment, should the society go bust.
So careful selection in this area is needed. This is where ExBal, a new unit
trust, claims it can help. It will invest around 60 per cent of its
portfolio in Pibs, with the remainder in the zero-coupon shares of
investment trusts to provide scope for capital growth.
The snag with this structure is that it sharply brings down the yield - the
main reason why private investors might be attracted to Pibs in the first
place. The initial yield on the trust was 6.5 per cent at launch, and that
had slipped to 6.3 per cent by mid-January.
The initial charge is 5.25 per cent and the annual charge 1 per cent. The
minimum investment is Pounds 750.
Exeter Fund Managers, who run the trust, are specialists in the
split-capital area.
GOLD LOSES ITS GLITTER
ALL THAT glitters has been distinctly unprofitable for unit trust investors
over the past five years. Of the 10 worst-performing trusts over the five
years to January 1, five were gold funds.
In the 1980s and early 1990s, gold has consistently failed to show the kind
of 'safe haven' characteristics that it showed in the 1970s. Even the Gulf
War failed to spark a rally. The price of bullion has been stuck between
Dollars 300 and Dollars 400 per ounce in the 1990s. Some disillusioned
central banks have recently offloaded part of their holdings.
With expectations for world inflation still low, it is hard to see what
could cause the gold price to rally. Which may be bad news for investors in
trusts such as Waverley Australasian Gold, which turned Pounds 100 into
Pounds 39.18 over five years.

New fund will track smaller companies - Investment Trusts / Indexed trusts
offer the investor a degree of insurance: his holding should not be
sabotaged by poor fund management decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and BARBARA ELLIS

<TEXT>
THOSE WHO believe in the long-awaited smaller companies revival got a chance
to back their hunch at the end of 1992 with the launch of Hoare Govett's
Smaller Companies Index Investment Trust.
The new trust aims to track the extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies
Index (excluding investment trusts) which included some 1,377 companies at
the start of 1991.
Indexed investment trusts are still relatively rare but offer the smaller
investor a degree of insurance; his holding will keep up with the market and
should not be sabotaged by the poor decisions of the fund manager.
The Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index has outperformed the All-Share over
the period since 1955; however, over the last four years the effect of
recession and high interest rates have meant that large company shares have
consistently beaten smaller stocks.
The recent years may have taken their toll on investor demand; Hoare Govett
raised only Pounds 28m for the trust, compared with its aim of up to Pounds
50m.
But the Hoare Govett trust will prove a useful benchmark for other smaller
companies trusts; the managers will need to beat the HG trust to prove they
are earning their fees.
BEYOND THE MERGER
THE MERGER of Henderson Administration and Touche Remnant has created the
largest fund manager in the UK investment trust sector.
The combined group will have three of the top five performers of the past 10
years: Lowland (managed by Henderson) and Law Debenture and TR City of
London (managed by Touche Remnant).
Since investment trusts are legally independent companies, it was thought
unlikely that merger would result in any management changes within the
group's investment trust range (the unit trusts are another matter).
Touche Remnant had been acquired by French bank Societe Generale in 1989,
but the French group decided TR no longer had the critical mass needed in
fund management.
The combined Henderson-Touche Remnant would have around Pounds 10bn of
assets under management - however, the problem of distribution, for a
company with no links to banks or insurance companies, may remain.
WHAT'S IN A BRAND?
THE ISSUE of corporate governance was one which the investment trust sector
was quick to tackle in the wake of the Cadbury report.
The Association of Investment Trust Companies produced a set of guidelines
in December, with the premise that an independent board is the best
guarantee of good practice.
This independence has come into question in recent years, with the growth of
'branding' of a range of trusts with company names incorporating the
identity of the fund manager. Branding does have some advantages, because it
helps to differentiate the trust in a crowded market, thereby attracting
more investors and narrowing the discount, to the benefit of all
shareholders.
But is the board of a branded trust really likely to risk the loss of
identity involved in sacking the investment manager? The AITC does not
believe that branding will be a problem, provided that the majority of the
trust board is independent.
Independence will be rigorously defined. The AITC guidelines state that 'the
condition of independence cannot be fully satisfied where a director is an
employee or former employee of the manager, or a professional adviser to the
manager, or is in any way remunerated by the manager.'
It is to be hoped that the guidelines of the AITC, a purely voluntary body,
will be followed by a sector which has known its fair share of scandals in
the past.
PEP AIMS FOR 9 PER CENT YIELD
INCOME is the main selling point for the Schroder Split Fund, a
split-capital investment trust, and the high income Pep linked with it.
The fund has three classes of share: capital shares (where the return
depends on gains made by the trust); zero-dividend preference shares (where
the return is expected to be 8.25 per cent over the life of the fund); and
income shares (which make up about 55 per cent of the fund but are entitled
to receive the whole of its income).
The high-income Pep will invest in the income shares of the Split Fund,
which are expected to have a gross starting yield of 9 per cent.
Fund manager Chris Rodgers says the trust's portfolio will be fairly
concentrated, with about 50 different shareholdings geared to stocks
yielding about 30 per cent more than the market average. Although he does
intend to include some convertibles among the holdings, these are not
expected to exceed 15 per cent of the total portfolio.
The income shares involve the buyer in the risk that he will lose part of
his original capital. The trust's assets will need to grow by 4.2 per cent a
year for the income shares to be repaid in full. The zeros are more than
covered (ie, there are enough assets to repay them in full) at the issue
price. The minimum investment in the Schroder High Income Pep is Pounds
1,000, and the group will be giving priority to investors applying for up to
the Pounds 6,000 Pep maximum.
The initial plan charge of 5.25 per cent is to be waived for investors who
apply for a Pep (for either 1992-93 or 1993-94, or both) during the launch
period. The annual plan charge is 1 per cent, and income from the Pep can be
paid out four times a year.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): A
time to lean on the dollar - The Professionals / Changes reflect damage
limitation and the search for pockets of growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION IN Germany. Recession in Japan. Equities in the US and the UK at
demanding levels, fully discounting fragile recoveries. In this bleak
investment setting at the start of 1993, our professionals have chosen to
lean hard on the one apparent certainty - a strengthening dollar.
Other changes, as we move into the first quarter of 1993, smack of damage
limitation - as in the divestment by both Baillie Gifford and Newton of
their small Japanese equity stakes - or increasingly fastidious targetting
of possible pockets of growth in the otherwise faltering march of equity
markets in Europe or the US.
The one positive exception is continuing enthusiasm for the smaller markets
of the Pacific Rim, though views differ on prospects in Hong Kong, where
Chinese threats against plans to develop local democracy have brought
turbulence to the market.
One must also ask how large a proportion of any portfolio can be put into
Asian markets that account for a tiny share of total world stock market
capitalisation. Baillie Gifford are immensely overweight, with 25 per cent
of the portfolio's assets now in these markets following the latest 5 per
cent boost. Gartmore are not far behind at 17.5 per cent.
There has been a slight shift in attitudes towards bonds, which have over
the past year strongly outperformed equities. Paul Myners has switched some
of his large US bond holding into US equities, on a view that comparative
performances are poised to change; while Howard Beaufort has added a 5 per
cent US bond holding as a means of capturing dollar strength. There has also
been a strong move in Europe away from sterling or Deutsche Mark bonds into
France.
Douglas McDougall's (Baillie Gifford) only change at the turn of the year
has been to sell his remaining Japanese equity stake, using the funds to
boost holdings elsewhere in Asia. Given comparative performances in 1992, he
probably wishes, in retrospect, that he had shifted from Japan to South-east
Asia much earlier. He remains bullish about Hong Kong, confident that
'commercial realism will prevail'.
In the UK, he says recent strength 'has taken the market to the top end of a
range of reasonable value'. He also sees US equities as expensive: 'The most
attractive feature in the US is the dollar, which can be played with more
confidence through the bond market.'
He sees Europe's markets being held hostage to the D-Mark, and, with the
German economy still likely to decline through 1993, is concentrating his
holdings in France.
Paul Myners (Gartmore) goes further than Mr McDougall, saying that the
economies of continental Europe look 'more and more like an economic
disaster'. His exposure remains limited to bonds.
His only change is to double his US equity stake to 10 per cent by
transferring funds from his substantial US bond portfolio, driven by a
singular confidence that the US economy is set to grow strongly.
'We seem to be in something of a golden scenario for US long-term assets . .
. The question is the relative preference for equities and bonds, which is
finely balanced, but probably in favour of equities at this point,' he says.
He remains enthusiastic about Asia, but prefers to avoid Hong Kong for the
time being, and is 'more pessimistic than the consensus' about Japan. He is
encouraged by economic prospects in the UK, predicting that 'for the first
time in four years the earnings surprises may be on the upside', but feels
that equity prices are 'to put it in the kindest possible way,
forward-looking'.
Mr Myners feels that small companies 'are interesting again', and is
focusing on companies that carry low levels of debt and have used the
recession to restructure and cut costs.
Howard Beaufort (Newton) says he is allergic to 'playing the currently
fashionable second- and third-liner game'. He remains 'cautious and
concentrated wholly on quality'. He has cut his cash holdings to 5 per cent,
and sold D-Marks for dollars.
He has further raised exposure to US dollar strength by adding 2 per cent to
his US equity holdings, and acquiring a 5 per cent stake in US bonds. The
only other new purchase has been to add 2 per cent to his equity stake in
South-east Asia. This has been funded by selling his small Japanese equity
holding, and shaving his European bond holdings.
He is optimistic about markets in Asia. The US economy is expected to grow
well, but equities there are fully valued. In contrast, he shares Mr
McDougall's concern that Europe's economies are being held hostage to German
interest rates, and confines interest to multinationals with substantial
dollar earnings, and companies in France, Switzerland and the Netherlands.
In the UK, new investment will be 'confined to the highest quality,
international, defensive companies'.
Tim Howe (Singer &amp; Friedlander) is almost alone in being willing to adopt an
optimistic tone - though, in Europe, optimism is confined to those countries
that have cut loose from Germany's obsession with inflation, and 'gone for
growth'.
He sees good prospects for second- and third-line stocks in the UK, predicts
a healthy recovery in the US, and even suggests that Japan 'may surprise on
the upside' this year.
He plans to raise his UK equity holding by 7 per cent to 65 per cent, and
his stake in US equities by 2 per cent to 7 per cent. This is funded by
taking profits on his 5 per cent UK bond holding, and shaving his holdings
in Pacific equities, European bonds, and cash.
This feature is not a competition but an allocation exercise, in which four
professional fund managers handle a Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf of a
hypothetical client of their choice - either wealthy a individual or a small
self-administered pension fund.
The fund managers emphasise that they are investing for the long term (10
years or more) rather than for short-term gain. The exercise started at the
beginning of October 1990. The portfolios given here were drawn up at the
beginning of this month, and will be reviewed at the end of March.

beginning of October 1990.  The portfolios given here were drawn up at the
beginning of this month, and will be reviewed at the end of March.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (25): Not for quick income
seekers - European PEPs / Dividend yields tend to be lower than those in the
UK, because of the different shareholding structures that are found on the
continent
</HEADLINE>

THE PEP investor is no longer dependent on the vagaries of the UK stock
market. Since the Budget of 1991, the qualifying rules for Peps have
required that a minimum of 50 per cent of a plan's assets be held in the
European community, not, as previously, in the UK.
A holding of European shares gives the investor a sensible measure of
diversification and a chance of foreign currency gains if the value of the
pound declines (as it did in 1992). Of course, the corollary is that the
investor risks both a currency loss and the possibility that European shares
might underperform the London market.
For the vast majority of investors, the best way of gaining exposure to the
European markets is via unit and investment trusts. There are plenty on
offer - 14 general, and six single-country, investment trusts; and 133 unit
trusts.
Such trusts have not produced particularly sparkling performances since the
1991 Budget, as the euphoria engendered by German reunification has turned
into the recessionary gloom caused by the Bundesbank's high interest-rate
policy.
But investing in Europe has proved advantageous over the longer term. The
average European unit trust rose by 60.8 per cent (offer-to-bid with income
reinvested) over the five years to December 1, whereas the average UK growth
trust grew by just 42.5 per cent over the same period. In the investment
trust market, the comparison was the same; the average European trust grew
by 73.1 per cent (mid-market to mid-market with net income reinvested),
while the UK general trust rose by 56.8 per cent.
How does the investor choose a trust? The first distinction to make is
between the general European funds and those based on a single country. The
latter offer greater rewards if you get your country selection right, but
much higher risk. Take the Aetna Iberian Growth fund: over the three months
to December 1, it was the worst-performing unit trust in the European
sector, but over the month of November, it was the best trust in the sector.
General European trusts will spread their investments across a range of
markets, and thus be protected against the effects of a political or
economic crisis in one country. Consequently they are far more suitable for
the small investor.
Among unit trusts, GT European was top over 10 years (with growth of 607.5
per cent), Fidelity European over seven years (290.5 per cent) and Baring
European Growth over five years (118.2 per cent). In the investment trust
world, F &amp; C Eurotrust was top over 10 years (647.5 per cent), while Second
Market Trust was best over five (133 per cent).
But consistency is probably more important than being top of the table over
an individual time period. The following unit trusts had above-average
performances for the sector, according to Finstat, over the one, two, three,
five and seven years to December 1:
Aetna European Growth, Barclays Unicorn European Growth, Baring European
Growth, Eagle Star European, Gartmore European, LAS European, Provident
Mutual European, Scottish Life European and Scottish Mutual European. NM
European carries the distinction of an above-average performance over all
those periods plus the last 10 years as well. However, it (like the Scottish
Life fund) is only available to those using a self-select Pep.
Because of the small size of the European investment trust sector, analysis
of average performances would not be particularly meaningful.
However, investors should be aware of some important factors before
venturing into this area. The first is that dividend yields on European
shares tend to be lower than those in the UK, because of the different
shareholding structures found on the continent. Hence the yields on most
European unit and investment trusts are only around 1 or 2 per cent.
These trusts are not designed for investors seeking immediate income. They
are suitable only for those who are prepared to invest for the very long
term (a decade or so) in order to benefit from dividend growth, or for those
who are likely to use up their annual capital gains tax allowance (Pounds
5,800 in 1992-93).
The second point is the size of the bid-offer spread on unit trusts. The
sector average is 6 per cent - not particularly high when compared with the
6.1 per cent average in the UK growth sector. But the range is wide: from
1.09 per cent on Lazard's European trust, to 8.19 per cent on Bell Court's
UK and European fund.
In other words, the investor who chooses Lazards instead of Bell Court is
getting a 7 per cent start. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, while the Lazards trust
is top of the sector over three years, the Bell Court trust is 98th. (Alas
for small investors, the Lazard funds require a minimum of Pounds 5,000).
For those who prefer investment trusts, a vitally important factor is the
discount to net assets at which the shares trade. If this discount widens,
the investor can lose money, even if European shares are rising.
In early January, the average discount in the sector was around 16 per cent.
Such a discount allowed investors to buy assets relatively cheaply and gave
scope for additional profit, were the gap to narrow.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Survey of Personal Equity Plans (24): A vehicle for the long
journey - Financial Planning / Equities, linked with concessions, can help
most people to meet their three biggest financial commitments, provided they
look beyond a five-year horizon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW DOES a personal equity plan fit in with your other financial plans?
For anything short-term (less than about five years) the answer is likely to
be 'not at all'. Peps are, after all, packaged equity investments, which can
go down in value. They should not be used to fund short-term commitments.
But over longer terms, when the strengths of equities as an asset are more
likely to be felt, and when the income and capital gains tax concessions
begin to make a difference, Peps now plainly have many uses.
The most obvious ways to use them are for what, for most people, are their
three biggest financial commitments: mortgages, school fees and pensions.
MORTGAGES
A Pep mortgage works in exactly the same way as an endowment mortgage. You
repay only the interest on the loan, while putting money into the Pep in
order to save to repay the capital, just as you would invest in an
endowment.
The most significant disadvantage, compared with an endowment mortgage, is
that you do not buy life insurance cover as part of the package. However,
term assurance is the cheapest form of life assurance, and it is usually
possible to shop around for a good rate. Those without dependants have no
need of life cover, in any case.
Peps' advantages include their superior flexibility. You can stop
contributing at any time without penalty, and invest with a different Pep
provider each year - both options which are not open to endowment-holders.
When arrears start to mount up, the painful experience of endowment
surrenders in the last two years has shown that this flexibility is a big
benefit. Then, Peps have tax advantages, as their funds are untaxed, unlike
those of an endowment.
Endowments offer slightly more security, as they are not invested wholly in
equities, and can quote a minimum 'sum guaranteed' in advance. But most life
funds are predominantly invested in stocks and shares anyway. So the case
for Peps as a mortgage repayment vehicle is strong - perhaps the poor
commission they pay to building societies and banks, compared with
endowments, has something to do with their failure to catch on.
SCHOOL FEES
School fees should work out cheapest if you save regularly, a long way in
advance, aiming for capital growth. The money from the investment can then
either be gnawed into regularly to meet fees as they become payable, or used
to provide an income generator, such as an annuity.
The only problem with using Peps, rather than life products, to do this is
risk-aversion. They cannot offer a guaranteed sum to pay off the fixed
commitment of school fees at a given date. However, school fees are prone to
inflate faster than other prices, and there is little point aiming for a
fixed sum, particularly as you pay for the guarantees by losing the chance
of some extra growth on top, or 'limiting the up-side'.
Even so, Peps should still probably not be regarded as the bedrock of a
school-fees plan. This distinction should belong to tax-efficient
investments which carry less risk, such as Tessas, deposit accounts held by
non-taxpayers, or, possibly, zero-dividend shares of investment trusts.
PENSIONS
Nobody suggests that Peps should replace your mainstream pension - the
benefit of having your premiums 'grossed up' when you invest should not be
foregone. But when it comes to topping-up the pension in the last few years
before retirement, a valid case can be made for using Peps rather than the
standard pension product for this purpose, the additional voluntary
contribution (AVC).
Like any other pension, premiums paid into an AVC are grossed up, an
advantage which Peps do not share. But after this, all of an AVC must by law
be converted into an annuity when you retire. This is not tax-efficient, as
the annuity is largely taxed as income, and limits your freedom either to
keep the fund invested, should you not need the income immediately, or to
splash out on a large capital sum for a round-the-world cruise.
So the trade-off is between: tax-efficiency as you enter, with an AVC; and
tax-efficiency when you exit, plus extra flexibility, with a Pep. The case
for using Peps, at least partially, in planning a pension top-up is strong.
Peps can also, more riskily, be used as part of a 'back-to-back' scheme with
a temporary annuity to pay a high regular income. An investor would put part
of a capital sum into an annuity, which would pay out the high regular
income by gradually repaying the capital. The remainder would go into a Pep,
which would re-invest its income and with luck would grow enough to replace
all the capital paid out from the annuity by the end of the annuity's term.
These schemes are very efficient income generators, but investors should not
enter into them without realising that there is a distinct risk that some
capital will be lost.

Nine shelters for the far-sighted - The Tax Deadline 3, Investments /
Tessas, Peps and National Savings are ideal for the small saver. Higher-rate
taxpayers may need to approach life policies with some caution, while the
BES still has something to offer them
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ARE YOU paying more tax than you should? One way of reducing bills is to
employ a clever accountant; another is to take advantage of any number of
tax-efficient investments which have been designed to attract savers. . .
Personal equity plans. You can hold Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and Pounds
3,000 in a single-company Pep in any single tax year. A Pep is free of both
income and capital gains tax, but charges can be high (see the survey
starting on page 18 of this Review).
Tax-exempt special savings accounts. These are aimed at the small saver, and
the most you can shelter from tax is Pounds 9,000 staggered over five years.
Tessas were introduced on January 1, 1991. The maximum investment allowed in
the first year is Pounds 3,000, and the ceiling for deposits in subsequent
years is Pounds 1,800 subject to the Pounds 9,000 maximum. Deposits are made
on the anniversary of the account. Net interest can be withdrawn without
penalty, but the capital must remain untouched over five years to get the
tax break.
National Savings. Index-linked and fixed-rate certificates are free of
income and capital gains tax, and are particularly suitable for higher-rate
taxpayers. The 40th issue savings certificates offer 5.75 per cent per annum
compound if held for five years. The maximum investment is Pounds 5,000,
although you can reinvest an additional Pounds 10,000 of matured
certificates.
The 6th index-linked certificates guarantee to pay 3.25 per cent per annum
compound above the retail prices index, if held for five years. Once again
the maximum investment is Pounds 5,000, and the same conditions on
reinvested certificates apply. Investors can hold both index-linked and
savings certificates.
Basic-rate taxpayers fared well with the First Option Bond when it was
launched last summer, but it has since been withdrawn. They can consider
Capital Bonds as an alternative to certificates, although these are subject
to tax, which is payable throughout the life of the bond. Series G offers a
guaranteed 7.75 per cent gross per annum compound if held for five years.
The maximum investment is Pounds 100,000.
Pensions: Pension contributions, as discussed on the previous page, normally
enjoy tax relief, as do additional voluntary contributions. The fund into
which they are paid is exempt from income or capital gains tax, so the
return on investments should be higher than on other savings schemes. There
are limits on the amounts of contributions qualifying for relief in any one
year.
If your employer's scheme is contributory, you get tax relief at your
highest rate on your contributions. The tax limit on contributions into a
personal pension plan depends on the time you took out the plan. If it was
before July 1, 1988, you make gross payments and get basic-rate and
higher-rate tax relief through the PAYE system, a rebate or a lower tax
bill.
If you decide to receive some of your pension as a lump sum on retirement,
this will be paid to you tax-free; and the pension itself is taxed as earned
income, not investment income.
Friendly Societies. A 10-year regular savings plan pays out a lump sum at a
fixed date or on death. The fund in which the money is invested is tax-free,
and the pay-out is also free of income and capital gains tax. However, the
maximum annual contributions are limited to Pounds 200. Friendly societies
also offer baby bonds, which are a way to shelter gifts from parents to
children. However, the societies have recently been criticised for
inefficiency and high administrative charges which tend to reduce the
tax-free advantage given to their funds.
Life policies. Originally designed to pay out to dependants on death, many -
such as 10-year endowments - have become savings plans in their own right.
Basic-rate taxpayers do not have to pay tax on the proceeds of a life
insurance policy, but the rules are different for higher-rate taxpayers. The
amount they have to pay is dependent on the length of time they have held a
policy, and whether it is a 'qualifying' policy or not.
A 'qualifying' policy is one into which regular annual premiums are paid,
usually for at least 10 years. Higher-rate taxpayers will not have to pay
tax on the proceeds of a qualifying policy as long as they have held it for
at least three-quarters of the term of the policy, or for 10 years,
whichever is shorter.
The amount of tax that a higher-rate taxpayer may have to pay on a
non-qualifying policy depends on the gain. This is calculated as the amount
received when the policy comes to an end, less the total premiums paid -
unless the policy is cashed early.
Business Expansion Scheme: 'Buy now while stocks last' will be the marketing
motto of the BES this year, because it is to be abolished in December (see
also, next page). The maximum that can be invested is Pounds 40,000 and the
total value of the investment is deducted from the investor's total taxable
income. A 40 per cent taxpayer will therefore receive a rebate of 40 per
cent of the amount invested.
The least risky form of BES is the 'buy back' scheme, where a BES company
buys accommodation on behalf of a third party - usually a college or a
housing association - and receives a covenant to buy back the property at a
fixed price after five years.
Provided the third party does not go bankrupt in the meantime, and can raise
the money, the risk is minimised.
Enterprise Zones: EZs are government-selected run-down regions which need
investment; they are only allowed for non-residential property. Top-rate
taxpayers get a rebate of 40 per cent on the value of their investment.
There is no maximum limit on investment, but investors must usually commit
themselves to a 25-year term.
Enterprise Zone Trusts buy properties and split them into units, allowing
investors to buy a share of a building which might otherwise be too
expensive. The minimum for most schemes is Pounds 5,000. Because of the
property slump, there are now few EZs on the market.
Trusts: An accumulation and maintenance trust is one way of reducing the
inheritance tax burden. Income made by the trust is kept in it
(accumulated), although some income can be drawn if it is for the
'maintenance, education or benefit' of the children. The trust comes to an
end, once the child is between 18 and 25 years old, when the estate is
passed over to them.

Don't let the years slip away - The Tax Deadline 2, Pensions / If you can
afford to pay more than the maximum contribution, you may still be able to
mop up unused past tax relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE tax year ends, retirement gets another year closer. The self-employed
and those employees who do not have access to a company pension scheme have
considerable flexibility in maximising tax relief, by making end-of-year
pension contributions to a personal pension plan or a retirement annuity
contract.
In particular, those who were unable to make contributions over the past few
years can take advantage of Inland Revenue rules that allow them to mop up
unused tax relief.
The amount you can pay into your plan will vary according to your age,
earnings and whether you have a personal pension, a retirement annuity or a
combination of the two.
Personal pensions replaced retirement annuities in 1988, but, although the
latter are no longer sold, it is still possible to make contributions to an
existing contract. If you contract out of the state earnings-related pension
scheme (Serps) using an 'appropriate' personal pension, then your Serps
rebate is paid in addition to your contribution limits.
Contributions are based on 'net relevant earnings' which, for the employed,
roughly equate to gross earnings, and for the self-employed are defined as
income chargeable under Schedule D (that is, income less capital allowances
and other allowable expenses).
Personal pension holders are further restricted by the 'earnings cap', which
limits the maximum salary on which personal pension contributions can be
based to Pounds 75,000 for the 1992-93 tax year. This means that a young
employee up to age 35 can pay a maximum personal pension contribution of
Pounds 13,125, while someone aged 62 can pay up to Pounds 30,000.
The earnings cap does not apply to contributions paid solely to retirement
annuities, although maximum contribution limits are lower under these
contracts than on personal pensions. If you want to pay contributions to
both types of plan, then the personal pension limits apply across the board
but you immediately become subject to the earnings cap.
Specialist help is needed if you are a high earner and want to find out
which plan you should pay into for the current tax year. Gerry Hart,
managing director of tax consultants RBA Associates, said that if your
earnings exceed the following figures you can put more into a retirement
annuity for 1992/93 than into a personal pension:
 ------------------------------------
Age at April 6 1992        Earnings
 ------------------------------------
Under 36              Pounds 75,000
36-45                        85,714
46-50                       107,142
51-55                       112,550
56-60                       116,667
61-74                       109,090
 ------------------------------------
Employees with personal pensions pay contributions net of basic rate tax,
and must claim higher-rate tax relief, where applicable, through their tax
return. Employees with a retirement annuity and the self-employed with
either contract, pay contributions gross and claim tax relief through their
annual return.
Most pensions advisers reckon the best way to structure contributions is
through single premium payments. This is because the amount deducted from
your contribution to cover the provider's management charges and the
intermediary's commission is far less on a single premium than on a regular
monthly or annual premium arrangement. This same advice applies to employees
who want to top up their company pensions through a free-standing additional
voluntary contribution.
Provident Life and Professional Life offer non-commission plans, while unit
trust personal pensions, available from Gartmore, Rothschild Asset
Management and Fidelity, pay commission at about 4 per cent. It is also
possible to have all or part of the commission on a standard life-office
plan reinvested in your fund, but this must be handled by an adviser and
naturally you will pay a fee in lieu of the commission given up.
MOPPING UP UNUSED RELIEF
If you have sufficient capital to pay more than the permitted maximum
contribution for the current year, then you can make use of the Inland
Revenue 'carry-back and carry-forward' provisions to mop up unused tax
relief in previous years.
Professional advice should always be sought, because the rules governing
these provisions are complex, particularly where you have a combination of
personal pension and retirement annuities.
Under the carry-forward provisions, if you had self-employed or
non-pensionable earnings in any of the previous six years and did not use up
the full contribution limit at the time, you can make use of that tax relief
now.
To calculate unused relief, simply deduct contributions paid from maximum
permissible contributions in relation to net relevant earnings for each tax
year.
Susan Smith, assistant product manager at Scottish Provident, said: 'There
are three important points here: First, maximum contributions must have been
paid in the current tax year before any carry-forward exercise can be used.
Second, you must work through each previous tax year in order, starting with
year six and working forward to the present. Third, in the year of
assessment, the contribution you want to pay must not exceed your net
relevant earnings for that year.'
Employers are not permitted to contribute to the 'mop up' exercise - they
can only contribute towards the current tax year's limits.
Carry-back provisions allow you to make an election for your contribution to
be treated as though it had been paid in the previous tax year. If you had
no earnings in the previous tax year, you may be able to carry the
contribution back to the year before that. Unlike the carry-forward
provisions, if you use carry-back, you do not have to make the maximum
contribution in the current tax year first.
Carry-back is particularly useful for those whose earnings fluctuate from
year to year. Authors and actors are classic examples, but many
self-employed people have this problem. If your earnings last year took you
into the 40 per cent tax bracket, but this year you are only liable to
basic-rate tax, through the use of carry-back you can treat your next
contribution as though it were paid in 1991-92 and claim the full 40 per
cent tax relief.
A request for contributions to be carried back must be made within three
months of the end of the current tax year to carry back to the 1992-93 tax
year.
Finally, a combination of the carry-back/carry-forward provisions can be
used to mop up tax relief for up to seven years. The timing of payments
under this arrangement is critical, and should only be attempted through a
pensions and tax expert.

THE NEW tax year starts in just over nine weeks time, on April 6.
A year ago, taxpayers did not know whether there would be a Labour or a
Conservative government, which made tax planning difficult. That uncertainty
is removed this year but, given the size of the public sector borrowing
requirement, chancellor Norman Lamont may make some tax changes in the
Budget in March. The most widely expected are an above-inflation rise in
excise duties, and an increase in the scope of value-added tax. There is
nothing that tax planning can do to mitigate these measures.
There is a risk, perhaps not in this Budget but later, that the government
could increase direct taxation or reduce the scope or number of tax
shelters. One, the Business Expansion Scheme (see page 8), is already to
close at the end of the year.
It is therefore time to take advantage of the still large number of
tax-efficient vehicles available. You should also scrutinise your finances,
perhaps with professional help, to see that they are being structured in the
most tax-efficient way.
Some of the products referred to in this article will be discussed further
in the three pages that follow.
JOINT FINANCES
Once you receive your tax return form for 1992-93, at the end of April or
the beginning of May, all the income earned and capital gains made during
the year to 6 April will have to be recorded.
To begin with, are you making use of the different tax bands? In his last
Budget, Mr Lamont introduced a new band of 20 per cent, payable on the first
Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. Basic rate tax at 25 per cent is payable on
taxable income over this amount up to Pounds 23,700, when the higher rate of
40 per cent tax is levied.
If your spouse is paying tax at a lower rate than you are, or is a
non-taxpayer, you have considerable flexibility in rearranging your tax
affairs, because of the introduction of independent taxation in 1990. This
means that a husband and wife each have a personal allowance, which is
Pounds 3,445 for the tax year 1992-93. Those aged over 64 have higher
allowances.
Income-producing investments and deposits, should be transferred to the
lower-rate payer, to make use of their lower tax band. If, for example, you
are paying tax at 40 per cent, transferring your investments to a
non-earning spouse, means that there will be no tax to pay on the first
Pounds 3,445 and that the excess will be taxed at 25 per cent.
If the husband's income is less than total allowances, the married couple's
allowance of Pounds 1,720 can be transferred to the wife. From April 6,
1993, married couples will be able to specify which of them should receive
the allowance, or can elect to split it between them. You must do this
before the tax year and should write to your tax office well before April 6,
otherwise the allowance will be paid to the husband.
PENSIONS
Additional voluntary contributions to a pension are one of the most
tax-efficient ways of increasing your pension benefits. Tax relief can be
claimed on AVCs and also on premiums paid into a personal pension plan. The
maximum contribution depends on your age. (See page 6).
CAPITAL GAINS TAX
You can make gains of Pounds 5,800 in the 1992-93 tax year, before having to
pay tax (allowance is made for the effect of inflation on asset prices).
Gains above Pounds 5,800 are charged at your highest rate of income tax.
Many people do not use up their capital gains tax allowance, and end up with
an unnecessarily large bill when they come to sell their investments.
For shareholders, one way round this problem is to 'bed-and-breakfast' the
shares by selling them on the market and repurchasing them to bring gains up
to the tax-free allowance. Your taxable gain next time you sell will be
reduced, because you will be starting from a higher base.
Bed-and-breakfasting can also be used to establish losses in order to reduce
the size of your capital gains. The annual CGT exemption cannot be carried
forward (though losses can be carried forward to set against future gains);
but if you have reached your CGT threshold and your spouse has not, you can
transfer assets to them, so that they can use their Pounds 5,800 allowance.
INHERITANCE TAX
You can give Pounds 3,000 in any tax year to a beneficiary, without invoking
any IHT liability. If you did not use last year's allowance, you can still
do so by the end of this tax year, although you must have used up this
year's Pounds 3,000 first. So a married couple can transfer Pounds 12,000 to
their children if they did not use up last year's allowances. The allowance
can only be carried forward by one year - it is lost thereafter.
You can also give small gifts of Pounds 250 to as many people as you like,
free of IHT, in any tax year.
PERSONAL EQUITY PLANS
You can top up your general Pep with the Pounds 6,000 allowable for the tax
year. A further Pounds 3,000 can be placed in a single-company Pep (see the
survey, starting on page 18).
TESSAS
Introduced in January 1991, a tax exempt special savings account pays
tax-free interest on a maximum investment of Pounds 9,000 deposited over
five years. (See page 7).
DEPOSITS
If you receive interest gross from a bank or building society account, Moira
Elms, of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, suggests closing and then reopening
a savings account as a means of paying less tax on the interest. This is
because closing an account triggers a change in the way you are taxed.
The Inland Revenue normally assesses your tax liability on the interest
earned in the previous tax year, known as 'prior-year basis'. But if you
close an account before the end of the tax year, the tax due will ordinarily
be based on interest earned during the current year (current-year basis).
Since interest rates on bank and building society deposits have been
falling, it is to your advantage to get your liability assessed on a
current-year basis.
CHARITIES
Gift Aid scheme will allow you to give Pounds 600 or more to charity
tax-efficiently by the end of the tax year.
COMPANY CARS
Brooks Macdonald Gayer, financial advisers, remind employees to plan
business journeys so that the lower mileage limit of 2,500 or the upper
limit of 18,000 is exceeded by the end of the tax year. The standard scale
charge of company cars is increased by 50 per cent for low business mileage,
and reduced by 50 per cent on mileage exceeding the upper limit.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1):
Long-term investors prosper amid the rubble - Keynote / But many older ones,
seeking to live off their investment income, are having to tighten their
belts, as interest rates fall and the structure of returns changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
THERE MAY not be another quarter like it for quite a while.
Under the impetus of two separate one-point cuts in short-term interest
rates, on October 16 and November 13, and of a further depreciation of
sterling from Dollars 1.78 to Dollars 1.51, the UK stock market showed
healthy gains, and in sterling terms the overseas stock and bond markets
showed up very positively, too.
Even government securities (or gilt-edged) weathered the conditions quite
well, although there were misgivings about a worsened outlook for inflation
and government borrowing. But while fixed-income gilts achieved only slight
gains, in doing so they consolidated their significant advances earlier in
the year.
During the October-December period the FT-SE 100 Index climbed 11.5 per cent
in capital value, and the FT-Actuaries World Index in sterling terms put on
17 per cent. In dollar terms, it is true, the World Index went down by about
1 per cent, but that was strictly a problem for the Americans.
It may have been a fool's paradise, but long-term UK investors continued to
prosper in 1992 amidst the rubble of Britain's economy, which appears to
have shrunk by about 1 per cent during the 12 months.
Fortunately, a certain amount of economic recovery began to be evident by
the end of the year. Car sales jumped in December, taking annual
registrations to just above the 1991 level, and although December retail
sales overall were unexciting, business generally seemed to improve markedly
over the Christmas and New Year period. Some of the business-confidence
indicators began to pick up, too, though there have been false dawns in this
respect before.
In terms of total return (capital gains plus gross income), UK equities
produced about 21 per cent and gilts 16 per cent during 1992. The best
results of all were generated by foreign currency bonds, which in many cases
returned 30 per cent or more to sterling investors, with Japanese and Dutch
government bonds leading the pack.
There was a harsh flipside to all this, however. Investors in short-term
savings accounts were exposed to the drop in interest rates, so that by the
end of the year the gross return on instant access building society accounts
had slipped to about 5 per cent. Older investors seeking to live off their
investment income found that they were having to tighten their belts, after
several fat years.
At the end of June long-dated gilts yielded almost 1 per cent less than the
clearing bank base rate. By the end of September they yielded 0.4 per cent
more. And by the end of December that positive differential had widened to
1.9 percentage points. It is an odds-on bet that the gap will grow further
in 1993.
These changes in the structure of investment returns (technically described
as a steepening of the yield curve) are having dramatic effects on savers
and on institutions. During the years of high interest rates from 1988 to
1991, the building societies were pulling in anywhere between Pounds 500m
and Pounds 1,000m a month in net receipts over their counters. But in the
final two quarters of 1992 that changed into a net outflow (although
interest credited to accounts kept the overall savings total growing on a
modest scale).
New savings are, in effect, now going elsewhere. Sales of unit trusts are
picking up, and the life assurance companies are doing a big business in
lump-sum savings products such as with-profits bonds and guaranteed income
bonds. National Savings will contribute Pounds 5bn or more to government
funding this financial year, against a negative figure in 1989-90, although
Norman Lamont withdrew the controversial First Option Bond (the particular
target of building-society fury) in his Autumn Statement on November 12.
The decline of the credit institutions has gone hand-in-hand with the
weakness of credit-based investments, notably property. Whereas the
sensitive and liquid equity market moved ahead in the fourth quarter of
1992, the sluggish and inefficient property markets carried on sinking. Both
the residential and commercial markets continue to be dominated by the
overhang of property for sale, and values typically fell by 8 to 10 per cent
during the year as a whole, though with substantial regional variations.
The average house price fell by anywhere between 2 and 5 per cent in
October-December, depending on whether you believe Halifax or Nationwide's
statistics. This failure of values to respond positively to the drop in
mortgage rates shows how deep-rooted are the problems of the owner-occupied
residential property market.
For instance, unemployment was rising by about 30,000 a month during the
final quarter. Headlines about redundancies everywhere from Barclays Bank
and British Coal to British Aerospace scarcely served to boost the
confidence of house-buyers. Perhaps the time has now come for
bargain-hunting in houses, but prices are unlikely to recovery for some time
yet.
So why did the UK stock market take such a different view? Partly because it
has an international dimension. UK-listed companies earn getting on for half
of their profits overseas, and devaluation will consequently help their
earnings as measured in pounds. But by December buyers were switching their
emphasis to the smaller, domestically-oriented companies which had been left
behind in the market's rally. These companies will need a revival in the
British economy to justify their higher ratings.
There were clearly also some purely financial reasons behind the strength of
share prices in late 1992. A lull in the pace of government funding
coincided with a virtual absence of issues by companies. As interest rates
fell, liquidity was drained out of the money markets and attracted into the
long-term markets. The balance was favourable for the stock market.
This may only have been temporary, however. The Bank of England will be
stepping up its sales of gilt-edged in 1993, seeking to hit a gross target
of Pounds 50bn or more. Because foreigners have mostly stopped buying gilts,
in view of the extra currency risks since the UK's exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism in September, the buying power of domestic investors
could be tested.
British companies will also be tempted to launch rights issues into a
buoyant stock market, especially if there is a glimmer of light visible in
the economy.
A crucial element will be the trend in dividend payments. Although October
to December is not a major season for dividend declarations, there were many
cuts, and by the end of the year aggregate payments were running slightly
below the 1991 level.
Last autumn, the stock market was busy celebrating the impending fruits of
devaluation. But in 1993 investors may be waiting anxiously for the harvest
to ripen.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Technology: Stained glass window dressing - Worth Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stained glass windows suffer from pollution just as much as masonry. But to
prevent further deterioration restorers have to isolate the cause of the
corrosion and the potential damage.
This is where scientists from the Fraunhofer Silicate Research Institute in
Wurzburg, Germany, have stepped in. One of them, Dieter Fuchs, has developed
a type of glass that corrodes much faster than normal. By placing pieces of
it, each just a few centimetres square, on the surface of the windows, the
mini-sensors show what could happen to the glass in the future.
Corrosion measurements are taken using infra-red light to enable restorers
to calculate the best way of treating the stained glass. Fraunhofer Silicate

Colour photocopiers have worried the police for years because of their
potential for copying bank notes. So the Japanese manufacturer Omron has
developed a bank note recognition system that can be incorporated into
photocopiers.
The device can detect attempts to copy notes from 23 countries. It uses
fuzzy logic, a computing technique which enables the input data to be

FT  29 JAN 93 / Technology: Cutting the cost of precision - A British
invention may bring accurate machining to a much broader market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What does a compulsive inventor do once he has turned an invention into a
commercial success? One answer is to turn his attention to the manufacturing
process that makes his product.
This is exactly what David McMurtry is doing at Renishaw, the metrology
company that grew from his invention of touch trigger measuring probes and
is now one of the UK's few high-technology manufacturing success stories.
At its factory outside Stroud, Gloucestershire, Renishaw has reduced
considerably the length of time it takes to machine the components that make
up its probes.
The company has done this by cutting sharply the cost of continuous,
unmanned manufacturing. It says it has slashed the time it takes to set up
machine tools to perform multiple engineering functions - thereby providing
hope for an escape from long machine runs which often lead to large amounts
of work-in-progress.
It is early days. So far, the company has applied the technology it calls
the Renishaw Automated Milling Turning and Inspection Centre (Ramtic) only
within its own factory. But Renishaw could be about to do for machine shops
what Alan Sugar, in his heyday, did for consumer electronics - bring
low-cost precision engineering within the grasp of a much broader market.
'We are bringing high-tolerance production to the average shop floor,' says
Ben Taylor, Renishaw's assistant chief executive.
What Renishaw is aiming for is a flexible manufacturing system at a fraction
of the cost of a conventional set-up. FMS units - or cells - are designed to
perform a number of machining functions that are numerically controlled by
computer instructions. But a bank of FMS cells can cost more than Pounds 1m.
Renishaw's approach was to take a standard vertical machining centre - the
most easily available system, that might cost about Pounds 100,000 - and
modify it.
These machines are not inherently highly accurate because they twist, expand
and bend during a machining cycle.
Renishaw, however, achieves what Taylor calls the 'final level of precision'
by placing next to the raw material that is to be machined a model of the
component. Before the machine is set up, this 'artefact' has been checked in
a co-ordinate measuring machine and its dimensions are known to a high
degree of accuracy.
While simple vertical machining centres are not highly accurate over long
cycles, Renishaw has shown that they do not change shape over short spans of
time.
Using indexable measuring probes, the machine tool is able to make an
immediate comparison between the machined part and the artefact. The exact
position of the tool relative to the machined part is fed to the computer
which modifies its instructions to the machine tool, if necessary. 'We have
removed the uncertainty of measuring on a machine tool,' says Taylor.
The system has other benefits. It is capable of continuous verification and
recording of the process without interrupting the manufacturing process.
With many FMS cells, a machined part would have to be removed to verify that
it had been made within acceptable tolerances.
The most striking improvements have been to cut set-up times, making it more
economical to run smaller batches. While it might take three to six hours to
set up a milling centre, with the Ramtic there is no set-up time, after the
carousels that carry the tools are kitted up. Renishaw's early experience in
cutting production cycle times is equally impressive. This is up to three
times faster partly because Ramtic's tools are changed less often than an
FMS.
Taylor says that as a result, Renishaw should be able to do without the
stock room. Batches of components for its own probe products would be made
to order 'like a short-order cook'. 'Our plan is just-in-time production,'
he says.
Word of Renishaw's work on its manufacturing productivity has had a mixed
but limited reception. Japanese and American companies have beaten a path to
Renishaw's door after the company introduced the technique at Birmingham
Mach' 92, the industry trade fair. And engineers from the US Department of
Defence's weapons complex at Los Alamos have shown great interest in
Ramtic's ability to monitor precision engineering.
Some manufacturers of FMS systems have yet to be convinced that Renishaw is
really bringing a new technology to bear. They also wonder whether the
system might only be relevant for manufacturers who would like to have short
manufacturing runs.
By the summer, Renishaw may be able to answer the sceptics. It hopes to have
put a ring of patent protection around its use of artefact comparison and is
considering whether it will then sell or license the Ramtic hardware and
software.
If Renishaw has made a breakthrough in the cost of precision, the ripples
could spread rapidly through the engineering industry. Renishaw would also
have another market - the Ramtic process relies on a number of its products.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Technology: Share prices wherever you go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the busy and mobile investor or fund manager who feels anxious and
deprived without instant access to financial news and prices, a new portable
device the size of a video cassette is being brought on to the market.
Called Financial Alert, it uses a radio tuner to provide UK and foreign
share prices and news updates. It can track highs and lows and pre-set
investment limits with an in-built alarm system.
As yet, the device - consisting of a keyboard and small screen operated by a
rechargeable battery, all in a black leather folder - is only available in
the Netherlands where it was introduced about a year ago. The UK launch is
on February 10, with plans to introduce it later in Sweden, Switzerland and
the US.
Rob Schram, managing director of Alert Network, the UK distributor of
Financial Alert, hopes to have up to 1,000 in use in the UK in a year's
time. He calls it 'a very powerful way of staying up with the market'. It
monitors prices of the FT-SE 100 shares plus 900 other UK stocks and those
of 100 continental European companies. It also carries foreign exchange
rates, international indices and data on futures contracts and gilts.
The screen has room for eight prices at a time, with a bleeper which can be
set to sound when any desired type of information comes up. Investors can
select their own information to put on special pages. All stored data can be
downloaded to a hard disc or printed out.
Schram hopes that Financial Alert, which has components (such as a
microprocessor, highly sensitive radio tuning device and liquid crystal
display) from the Far East and Dutch-developed software, will appeal to
institutions, private investors and corporate investment staff - in fact,
anyone likely to need information while away from their base and who will
feel distinctly uncomfortable without it. The cost is Pounds 160 a month
with a connection fee of Pounds 50; there is a refundable deposit of Pounds
330.

FT  29 JAN 93 / People: Taking off from Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the best jobs in the air transport business has become vacant as Gil
Thompson, chief executive of Manchester Airport, yesterday told his board he
wants to retire. His contract comes up for renewal in March, when he will be
63.
Thompson, a former British Airways general manager for northern England, has
had 12 remarkable years at Manchester, presiding over an increase in
passengers from 4m to 12.4m a year, making it Europe's fastest growing
airport.
On the way, Manchester became Britain's second official hub after Heathrow
and achieved international gateway status. It is now used by 95 airlines
flying to 165 destinations.
At the beginning of March, the Queen is due to open the first stage of
Manchester's Pounds 570m Terminal Two, Thompson's piece de resistance.
Combined eventually with a second runway, the new terminal will enable the
airport to leap four places to 12th in the world league table by size.
Thompson says the next great step forward - which envisages 30m passengers a
year and 50,000 new jobs locally by 2005 - should be placed in younger
hands. Among other things, a bruising battle looms with Cheshire residents
opposing a second runway and further expansion generally.
The board yesterday formed a sub-committee, Thompson included, to consider
how to pick his successor. He will stay on long enough to achieve a smooth
handover - and will be lodging the planning application for the second
runway in the spring.

FT  29 JAN 93 / The Property Market: No sign of growth in year-end data
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY yields reached a record of 10 per cent in the month of December,
according to new figures from the Investment Property Databank, a research
group. The data underlines the renewed sense of pessimism in the property
industry following the transitory signs of growth earlier last year.
The IPD Monthly Index shows that total returns for the month fell back once
again to zero, as longer yields combined with further declines in rental
values. The All Properties total return for the year sank to -0.1 per cent,
the first negative year-on-year return since December 1991.
The returns of the different sectors converged slightly in 1992. Retails,
which had a year-on-year return of 4.8 per cent, took over from industrials
as market leader in February. Retail rental growth dropped from -0.7 per
cent in December 1991 to -3.0 per cent, although capital growth improved by
almost 1 point over the period to stand at -2.8 per cent in December.
Offices produced an annual return of -6.1 per cent, which nonetheless showed
a 2 point uplift on 1991, the greatest relative improvement over the year.
Capital value growth for the year to December was -14.2 per cent while
rental value growth sank to -16.8 per cent.
Yields on industrials have been pushed out to 11.4 per cent. Rental value
growth fell by 9 points to -9.5 per cent, while capital growth dropped from
 2.1 to -8.6 per cent.

FT  29 JAN 93 / The Property Market: PSA's 'catalogue of disaster' - A
select committee inquiry into the shortcomings of the government agency has
cast a cloud over the final stage of its privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new chapter opened in the unhappy history of the Property Services Agency
this week, as the government launched the last stage of its privatisation.
It did not get off to an auspicious start.
On Monday, the government announced the tender of Building Management, the
largest part of the agency to be privatised. Just two days later, the
agency's shortcomings were on display as the all-party Public Accounts
Committee scrutinised the 1991-92 accounts of PSA Services.
The committee grilled Sir Geoffrey Chipperfield, the permanent secretary of
PSA Services, about write-offs of Pounds 12.8m in uncollected debts lost in
a paper chase of invoices and inter-departmental disputes. One committee
member described it as 'a catalogue of disaster'.
The MPs feared that these problems did not augur well for the sale. 'What
will be the effect of these uncollected debts on the value of the
companies?' asked one member. 'The facts we have been discussing will have
some depreciatory effect on the value of the company.'
'History is always with us and a purchaser will look at our short commercial
history and the mistakes that have been made,' agreed Sir Geoffrey. In his
view, the agency's shortcomings are in the past and would not significantly
affect values.
Mr John Anderson, an executive director of Bovis Construction, which was
called into the PSA 15 months ago to improve its management agreed.
'We have endeavoured to make the organisation more commercial. We have been
impressed by the way in which the people in this business have actually
tackled this task,' he told the select committee.
But improving the PSA's management, which has long been criticised for
inefficiency, is a daunting task. 'Few if any government agencies have come
under heavier fire,' said the Centre for Policy Studies in a 1988 paper
entitled The Property Services Agency - a Case for Demolition.
It accused the PSA, which then employed a 24,707-strong staff managing 11m
acres with a turnover exceeding Pounds 3bn, of being a 'Byzantine
bureaucracy'. It quoted evidence given to select committees of 'over
management, a slow decision-making process, and a lack of urgency and energy
in management'.
Moreover, the PSA had neglected maintenance, had failed to identify
opportunities to rationalise the estate and was insensitive to the needs of
conservation. With property accounting for 15 per cent of the cost of
government administration, there was a clear need to improve the efficiency
of its property business.
The first step in the overhaul of the agency was breaking it into PSA
Services (comprising PSA Projects, its construction arm, and the Building
Management business) and Property Holdings, which controls the government's
office portfolio and remains part of the Department of the Environment.
The monopoly of PSA Services was then removed by opening government
contracts up to competition. The final stage of the overhaul is the disposal
of PSA Services, which began two months ago with the sale of PSA Projects to
Tarmac, the construction and building materials group.
The sale proved controversial because of the unexpectedly high costs
associated with it. It involved a government payment of Pounds 54.9m to
cover unpaid bills and to meet the cost of putting the business on a
commercial footing. The government will also pay some Pounds 40m to cover
costs of redundancies, since only 800 of the 1,500 staff have agreed to
transfer to Tarmac.
The disposal of Building Management - which has been broken up for sale as
five separate businesses based in Edinburgh, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol and
London - once again raises concern that the government will have to foot an
excessively high bill for redundancies. The cost of redundancies at Building
Management, with five times as many staff as PSA Projects, could be far
higher than in the earlier disposal.
It is not yet clear how many of Building Management's staff will choose to
opt for redundancy or a temporary secondment to the buyer, which in many
cases amounts to a deferred redundancy.
The CPSA, the union for administrative grades, expects no more than half of
its members to transfer permanently. 'No one will be enthusiastic about
going from a job in the civil service to a job in the construction industry,
which works on a hire and fire basis,' says a representative of the
Institute of Managerial and Professional Staffs, another trade union.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm advising the government, believes
the unions are being excessively pessimistic about the proportion of staff
that will choose to leave. It believes that the costs of redundancy will be
offset by the sums that buyers will be willing to pay for the businesses.
'My belief is that there will be strong interest in the businesses. We will
be offered good prices which will offset the redundancy costs,' says Andrew
Jordan, a partner.
He reports that more than 70 companies have expressed interest in the five
Building Management businesses. These include contractors, consultants,
utilities and building management companies. The response reflects the
attraction of acquiring government contracts lasting up to five years and of
gaining a significant share of the market in a single transaction. 'Five
years of work is something that many people in the construction industry
would give their eye teeth for,' says Mr Jordan.
But will the advantages of buying a few years of government work outweigh
doubts about the businesses' ability to win future contracts? Many in the
industry are sceptical. 'I suspect PSA will not have very much competitive
advantage,' says one of its rivals. 'PSA does not enjoy the best relations
with government. The brand name is lousy.'
But the PSA's poor record is not just a stumbling block for the success of
this privatisation - it is also part of its rationale. Whatever the costs
and controversy involved in its dismantling, there is a good chance that the
management of the government's estate will be better as a result.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Management: Who's got the right stuff? - IBM needs a new
boss. Louise Kehoe asks the experts to speculate on John Akers' successor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WANTED: Executive willing to take on the most challenging management job in
the world. Must be a natural leader, able to make tough decisions, boost the
morale of 300,000 employees and win the confidence of millions of
shareholders and customers worldwide. Knowledge of 'computer-speak' helpful.
Salary high and negotiable. Benefits include instant worldwide recognition.
Wearers of white shirts need not apply.
As if International Business Machines did not have enough problems, the
beleaguered computer company is now searching for a new chief executive to
fill the shoes of John Akers, its chairman, who earlier this week gave
notice that he will resign his management role.
The committee of non-executive IBM directors, chaired by former Johnson and
Johnson chairman James Burke, may be aptly qualified to prescribe the tough
medicine that IBM needs. But finding the right person to cure IBM's ills
will not be easy. Burke, however, has thrown the field wide open by stating
that candidates from outside IBM's own management ranks will be considered
for the first time in the company's 79-year history.
Only one person - Ross Perot, the erstwhile US presidential candidate - has
so far publicly volunteered for the job but there is no shortage of ideas in
the computer industry, on Wall Street, and inside management consultancies
on what sort of individual is required. Virtually no one - not even
America's latest female role model Hillary Clinton - is being excluded.
Entering into the spirit of the search, the FT has asked a number of experts
for their views, not all of which will necessarily be appreciated at Big
Blue.
Scott McNealy, the irreverent young chairman of Sun Microsystems, a Silicon
Valley company that outsells IBM in the fast-growing market for computer
workstations, for example, claims he knows how to solve IBM's problems, but
is keeping his ideas to himself. 'This is capitalism,' he declares. 'It's
either have lunch or be lunch.'
Who should head IBM? he asks. 'Someone lousy.' Suggestions include the chief
executive of a computer company currently in bankruptcy and another who lost
his job after his company was acquired.
Steve Balmer, executive vice president of Microsoft, IBM's nemesis in the
personal computer market, is more generous. He pays tribute to Akers'
capabilities but still believes replacing him is a wise decision. 'IBM's
problems require what the management consultants call a 'set break', a fresh
approach. It will require a new way of thinking.'
While the assumption is growing that IBM will indeed select an Akers
successor from outside the company, observers are split on whether the
non-execs ought to go one step further and hire a non-industry specialist.
Steve Jobs, 37-year-old co-founder of Apple Computer, says IBM's problem is
that it views the computer market from a hardware perspective in an era when
computer programs, or software, represent the differentiating factor among
computer companies. IBM 'needs people who see the world through software
glasses. There is no one in IBM's top management who really understands
software,' adding that because of the rapid pace of change few people over
45 understand it.
Balmer of Microsoft, a company with many young executives, does not see
youth as a requirement for the job of IBM chief executive. 'Age is not a
qualification, the issue is whether or not the individual is locked into a
fixed way of thinking,' he says.
He does, however, agree with Jobs's view that IBM needs a leader who is
well-versed in technology. Without such an understanding it would be very
difficult for the IBM chief executive to have the courage of his convictions
when it comes to deciding which parts of the company should be consolidated
or spun off, he suggests.
According to Noel Tichy, professor of organisation at the University of
Michigan, IBM needs 'a revolutionary with the head, heart and guts to change
IBM, from the top down. He or she needs the capacity to crash through the
incredible bureaucratic resistance that still exists there'.
Without such resilience, the new chief executive could end up like Mikhail
Gorbachev, with the KGB on his back, Tichy suggests. 'And he must have
staying power. This is a 10-year job, not a one- or two-year stint. At
General Electric Jack Welch is 11 years into the game and he is not
finished.'
There are very few people of the calibre required to run IBM, Tichy and
others say. Welch himself, Larry Bossidy of Allied Signal, Michael Walsh of
Tenneco or John Sculley at Apple Computer might fit the bill, but none of
them is likely to make himself available to IBM. 'It is nave to think that a
Jack Welch or a Larry Bossidy would leave his company to join IBM,' says
Tichy.
Andrew Grove, president of Intel, could do the job, says regis McKenna. a
silicon valley industry consultant. 'He is good at dealing with complex
issues and has a high degree of energy - that is important. He's a good task
master and very good at recognising talent.' But Grove seems to be enjoying
the challenge of leading the fastest-growing semiconductor company in the
world.
Robert Palmer, a former semiconductor industry executive who succeeded Ken
Olsen last year as president and chief executive of Digital Equipment, the
second largest US computer company after IBM, is already winning plaudits
for improving Digital's performance.
Bill Gates, the 37-year-old chairman and chief executive of Microsoft, who
has made more money in the computer industry than anyone on earth, might
seem an obvious choice to turn his talents to IBM's problems. But his stormy
relationship with his big rival over the years would make him an unlikely
choice.
Paul Stern, who yesterday resigned from his post as chief executive of
Northern Telecom, may well, however, be seen as a serious contender.
Among non-industry candidates, General Dynamics' William Anders gets the
vote of Robin Buchanan, Bain &amp; Company's managing partner. Buchanan says
Anders, a former Nasa test pilot and Apollo Eight astronaut, has a rare
breadth of experience and believes in going for smaller and better.
George Cox, chairman of financial services and computer consultancy group
P-E International, is also certain that IBM should pick a non-specialist.
'The problem is not so much seeing the direction. . . it's turning the
wheel. Remember that Colin Marshall (of British Airways) used to run a car
hire business.'
Perot, meanwhile, who began his computer industry career at IBM, has said
that he would be glad to do whatever he could for the company. But opinion
is divided.
Perot 'has a lot of the right instincts. Autocratic as he is, he would not
be a bad choice,' says Tichy. Others, however, are not giving Perot their
vote. 'He would alienate a lot of people,' says McKenna.
IBM could look within its own ranks for a maverick insider, such as James
Cannavino, senior vice president and manager of IBM's personal systems
business. He is responsible for the company's growing workstation business.
Some, however, think that the search for a genius who can fix IBM's problems
overnight is bound to be fruitless. Instead, IBM should be looking for about
10 people to run its various business sectors, says Wilfred Corrigan,
chairman of LSI Logic, a Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturer. 'IBM
should become a portfolio of companies run by an investment management
group,' he says. 'It is clear that it cannot be run as a single business.'
Within IBM there are several strong business units that could be spun off as
independent companies, Corrigan says. Overseeing the transformation should
be the job of an investment banker, he suggests, eliminating the role of
chief executive of IBM.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Management: Spotting talent from Wyoming to London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How does a holding company with hundreds of far-flung operating subsidiaries
and tens of thousands of worldwide employees spot its best in-house
management talent?
Peter Harper, chairman of Hanson's UK industrial division, says the onus of
seeking out tomorrow's high-fliers inevitably falls on managing directors
and group divisional heads.
In recent years, however, Hanson believes its annual Achiever Awards scheme
 -whose 1992 winners were announced yesterday - has performed a valuable
supplementary role.
'One of its aims is to make sure that no one slips between the cracks,' says
Harper. 'MDs and finance directors get easily noticed inside companies, but
we believe the award scheme is important for others, especially those in
production positions, whom we might not see.'
Last year's competition - which as usual was divided into UK and US sections
 -attracted written submissions from almost 200 of Hanson's worldwide
employees in management positions. In the UK the award rotates between
'Young Achievers' under 30, 'Middle Managers' under 40 (the 1992 target
group) and 'All Comers'.
Ageism is hardly a criticism that can be made of a group run by two
septuagenarians, but bracketing by age group is potentially damaging to
American sensitivities so the scheme there is open to everyone every year.
Harper concedes it is impossible to know whether good senior management
candidates might have slipped through the net without the competition, and
whether the course of individual careers has been changed.
Most of the previous 11 winners have been promoted, notably the 1983 victor
Les Ashford who is now chief executive of Hanson Industrial Services and an
associate director since last year, and the 1982 Young Achiever Chris Thomas
(now chief executive of the Hanson subsidiary industries).
The odds, therefore, appear to be on further promotions for the latest UK
winner, Anthony Kujawa, a 38-year-old director of ARC Northern in charge of
Premix, and for his US counterpart Douglas Wagner, 45-year-old manager at
Peabody's Powder River Rochelle Mine.
Both men were delighted by their success - and who would blame them when the
prize is lunch with the boss and a two-week tour of Hanson operations on the
opposite side of the Atlantic - but insistent that there is a wider value to
both them and the company.
Says Wagner, whose mine is in a remote location in Wyoming 65 miles from the
nearest town: 'This has given not only me, but the employees who work for
me, a chance to be recognised in the group for what we have done. We are
part of the non-union portion of the Peabody mines, and there is not a lot
of mixing between the two.
'I started the operation from bare grass and we have increased profits and
beaten our budget every year.' Powder River now produces 16m tonnes of coal
a year and is reckoned to be the most productive surface mine in the US.
Kujawa's achievement was to pioneer environmental reviews at ARC Northern -
a practice which has since spread to other parts of Hanson's UK concrete and
aggregates subsidiary. His recommendations included the research for and
installation of the first concrete and waste recycling units in the UK, as
well as the installation of a new mixing process now claimed to be a model
for high-volume developments.
Kujawa says much of his work was carried out with the help of consultants -
but he cautions companies against bringing in consultants on their own. 'You
use their expertise but you need the commitment of your managers or the
whole thing can be a waste of time.'

FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley view is challenged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE views of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, on the links between
poverty and ill-health were yesterday called into question by Professor
Peter Townsend, her former tutor at Essex University.
In a letter to the health secretary, published in today's British Medical
Journal, Prof Townsend - who was chairman of the Child Poverty Action Group
when Mrs Bottomley worked there - says he understands from a wide variety of
her speeches that she no longer agrees with the evidence on poverty and
ill-health that she accepted in 1971.
'What is indisputable is that as an undergraduate and then as a research
worker for CPAG, far from regarding such evidence as defeatist talk, you not
only accepted it but added to it,' the letter says.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems urge tax commitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrats yesterday urged the government to say it would be
ready to see taxes rise in future and would temporarily increase public
borrowing to finance a job creation programme.
Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, said such an announcement by
ministers would reassure the markets, and international investors in
particular, that they were serious about reducing the deficit, thus enabling
the government to borrow more.
Mr Beith, making a clear distinction between borrowing for current spending
and for investment, said that acting now to cut unemployment would mean
lower borrowing in future. He called on the government - as proof of its
financial rectitude - to drop its promise to cut the basic rate of income
tax to 20p.
The Liberal Democrats urged the government to adopt its 'Action for Jobs'
package in the Budget. Mr Beith doubted the effectiveness of short-term tax
incentives. In his experience business preferred to be confident about
stability.
The package of measures would amount to just under an extra Pounds 4bn in
borrowing, including projects such as a training programme (Pounds 750m) and
investment in housing (up to Pounds 1bn).
The party believes that its plans would mean that 350,000 fewer people would
be unemployed by April 1994.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, accused the government of
complacency and believing its own propaganda, and said that the 'dash for
growth' had petered out in the face of the recent rash of bad economic news.
The party's proposals also criticise the Labour idea of a 'windfall' tax on
the profits of privatised utilities, arguing that it could reduce
infrastructure projects and cost jobs.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM's action follows precedent of
his predecessors - Robert Rice examines the context for John Major's
defamation case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday became the fourth prime minister this century to sue
for defamation.
Mr Harold - now Lord - Wilson embarked on several libel actions during his
time in Number 10.
In 1968 he received 'appropriate' damages plus costs in an agreed settlement
of a libel action against the US publishers of the International Herald
Tribune about an article which 'reported and repeated untrue rumours about
Mr Wilson's personal life'.
Mr Wilson also successfully sued pop group The Move in 1967 over a postcard
publicising a new record. It showed a drawing of Mr Wilson sitting on a bed
naked.
During the 1951 general election campaign, Sir Winston Churchill issued a
writ against the Daily Mirror over a front page story headlined 'Whose
Finger on the Trigger?' which Sir Winston claimed implied he was a
warmonger. The action was settled out of court for a sum of about Pounds
100,000.
After the first world war, Lloyd-George sued successfully over newspaper
allegations that he was offering honours for sale.
Libel lawyers were not surprised by Mr Major's decision to sue New Statesman
&amp; Society and Scallywag, describing it as a defensive move.
Mr Richard Shillito, a partner of London solicitors Oswald Hickson Collier,
said: 'The effect of issuing a writ is to serve notice on the rest of the
world that they repeat the allegations in substance at their peril.'
But there was surprise that the prime minister had chosen as his lawyers
Biddle &amp; Co. Mr David Hooper, the firm's senior libel lawyer, acted for
newspapers against the Conservative government during the Spycatcher affair.
Most lawyers said they did not expect the matter to go to trial. Mr Shillito
said it was difficult to see how the magazines could defend the action. He
expected the matter to be settled out of court.
Mr Peter Carter-Ruck, a defamation lawyer, said there seemed to be only two
points to decide about the New Statesman &amp; Society article. Was it
defamatory and if it was, was it fair comment on a matter of public
interest?
The magazines appeared to be on very difficult ground, he said.
New Statesman &amp; Society's lawyers Bindman &amp; Co indicated that it would
defend the action on the basis that the article was not defamatory.
If the case does reach court, Mr Major would be entitled to give evidence on
his own behalf.
If he chose not to, the magazines could subpoena him and Miss Clare Latimer,
the woman named in the magazines.
But if the magazines subpoenaed the prime minister, he would become their
witness and could not then be cross-examined by their counsel.
There is no limit in theory to the damages the prime minister could be
awarded by a jury, although the Court of Appeal now has the power to
reassess a jury award without a retrial.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, the Conservative MP for Billericay, who was awarded
Pounds 150,000 by a jury for a libel by an Essex businessman, recently had
that award reduced to Pounds 50,000 after consideration by the Appeal Court.
If for political reasons Mr Major did not want to be seen to be putting the
New Statesman &amp; Society out of business by pursuing an action for damages
which the magazine could not afford to pay, he could opt to have his action
dealt with by binding arbitration.
Both parties would have to agree to this process.
Mr Justice Popplewell was recently awarded Pounds 7,500 through this process
after he was libelled by Today newspaper.
Arbitration would only be an appropriate conclusion, however, if the
magazine accepted that the article was defamatory.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Building a new bonfire of inanities
 -Philip Stephens asks Neil Hamilton about the latest Tory crusade against
bureaucracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN politicians cast around for newsworthy initiatives to slip into
otherwise dull speeches, they sooner or later alight on the idea of a drive
to cut red tape.
Lord Wilson, never one to miss a good headline, saw the potential as long
ago as 1948 when as president of the board of trade he lit a bonfire of
war-time controls. Successive prime ministers - Lady Thatcher among them -
have followed his example, promising (and sometimes delivering) to lighten
the grip of the state bureaucracy on the nation's wealth-producers. In the
meantime, their governments have gone on legislating and regulating.
Now it is Mr John Major's turn. Next Tuesday cabinet ministers and permanent
secretaries will be ushered into No 10 Downing Street to provide tinder for
the latest bonfire.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the minister at the Department of Trade and Industry
charged with de-regulation, has been appointed guardian of the pyre.
He is an eminently suitable choice. A rightwinger with a libertarian streak
and an instinctive contempt for the bureaucrats of Brussels, Mr Hamilton is
refreshingly candid about the risks.
He is ready to admit that after 14 years in power the government cannot
absolve itself of responsibility: 'This is an exercise in in self-criticism
if you like. Regulation grows like mould. Until recently we have not had a
system in place for evaluating the costs'.
There are no illusions about the strength of Whitehall inertia. 'Obviously
permanent secretaries are not going to be impressed by a pipsqueak
undersecretary like myself.'
But he is assured of Downing Street's backing. The purpose of the seminar is
'to stamp on this initiative the prime minister's personal commitment and to
require each department to produce results'.
He chooses a canine metaphor: 'The prime minister has appointed me his
personal rottweiler to charge up and down Whitehall yapping and biting
people.' He intends to enjoy the exercise.
The starting point is the 6,000-odd government regulations turned up by a
Whitehall census of red-tape. Many are necessary, but many others impose no
special burden on business. But Mr Hamilton is convinced that many others
are too complicated, and some totally unnecessary.
He admits that a good proportion - more than 1,000 - were issued by his own
department. Among those which he is keen to scrutinise closely are company
law - particularly the audit requirements for small companies - and the
rulebooks which govern the City's self-regulatory agencies.
The employment, social security, environment and agriculture departments and
the Home Office are among the other main targets across Whitehall. So too
are the Treasury's tax-collecting agencies. Planning rules, health and
safety requirements, environmental health regulations and consumer
protection measures will be rigorously examined.
Mr Hamilton cites recent Home Office draft fire regulations - with a price
tag for industry estimated variously at between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 7bn
 -as an example of the old culture.
Before it was caught in a new system designed to ensure a 'cost-compliance'
evaluation, the Home Office wanted entrepreneurs working from home to
reverse all doors and install illuminated fire-exit signs over each of them.
That was an example of over-implementation of decisions made in Brussels. Mr
Hamilton is engaged on a census of all EC regulations which Britain has
implemented since joining the community nearly 20 years ago. But he is
acutely aware that 'we normally find a 10-page EC directive becomes an
85-page statutory instrument'.
Then there is the knee-jerk response to well-publicised tragedies. Mr
Hamilton cites the reaction a few years ago to the salmonella-in-eggs scare
when it 'threatened to destroy an entire industry' with new hygiene rules.
In future the government - and the media - should make rational judgments on
the degree of safety sensible relative to the cost. Otherwise cars would be
banned from the roads to improve safety. Cabinet ministers have been given
until April to bring forward regulations which can be scrapped or
simplified.
Mr Hamilton expects to light his bonfire in the parliamentary session which
begins in October. He wants to import from the US the idea of 'sunset'
provisions in new regulations which provide for the automatic expiry of some
regulations unless they are re-introduced. Cost-compliance assessments
should also be the norm. Ministers should be ready to measure also the costs
against the risks - to the public and their own political careers.
Mr Hamilton sounds determined, a round peg in a round hole whose task
coincides with his instincts. Whether he will convince his colleagues is
another matter. He recently lost a Whitehall battle against a regulation
requiring manufacturers to fit plugs on electrical appliances. The new rule
will be enforced by the DTI.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith raps standards of government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, last night launched a scathing attack on
what he claimed were declining standards in government, warning that
unchecked they would 'corrode public confidence' in the political system.
In a strongly worded speech Mr Smith accused Mr John Major's administration
of 'arrogance and insensitivity' in its behaviour and of compromising the
traditional impartiality of civil servants.
Calling for a Freedom of Information Act and a code of conduct to oversee
the roles and responsibilities of civil servants and ministers, he argued
that the consequence of a single party holding power for 13 years had been
to expose serious weaknesses in the constitution.
The Labour leader went on to demand that parliament be given more powers
over the executive, that greater devolution be given to the nations and
regions, and the restoration of power and influence to local government.
Mr Smith's attack signals a determination by Labour to tap what it believes
is mounting public anger at cavalier behaviour by senior ministers and
systematic abuses of power.
His 10-page speech insisted that his office had been inundated with letters
from the public expressing anger at efforts by the prime minister to brush
aside criticism.
He went on to single out as an example Mr Major's refusal to answer his
questions on the payment by the Treasury of some of Mr Norman Lamont's legal
fees over the eviction of a tenant from his London home.
'Hard-working British people do not pay taxes in order that they should be
used to bail out a Tory minister from some wholly private embarrassment for
which he himself was responsible,' he said.
As other examples of what he viewed as unacceptable behaviour, he went on to
cite Mr Michael Heseltine's failure to consult on the pit closure programme
that was later judged illegal.
The Labour leader then turned his fire on Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, whom he claimed had authorised British companies to pursue
telecommunications projects in Iraq at a time when the RAF was enforcing UN
sanctions against the country.
'This is a government from which nobody resigns unless absolutely forced to
do so by overwhelming pressure from the public, the media and their own
backbenchers,' he said, adding: 'Nobody takes responsibility.'

THE GOVERNMENT clashed with its backbenchers yesterday over European
Community proposals which call into question the future of the UK's Potato
Marketing Board.
Both Sir Peter Tapsell, Conservative MP for Lindsey East, and Mr Bill
Walker, Tory MP for Tayside North, expressed their constituents' concerns
about the possible changes which aim to harmonise the market control
mechanisms in different member states.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Party leaders accused over EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY and Labour backbenchers opposed to the Maastricht treaty attacked their
party leaders last night and accused them of acting in concert to give the
European Community more power at the expense of the British parliament, Ivor
Owen writes.
Mr Richard Shepherd, Tory MP for Aldridge Brownhills, scornfully referred to
the 'Con-Lab' front bench and protested that the leaders of the two main
parties had 'thrown out of the window any regard for the power of the
voter'.
He was strongly supported by Mr Ken Livingstone, Labour MP for Brent East,
who said the Labour leadership had spent so much time suppressing democracy
within its party for the last 10 years that it did not find the treaty
objectionable.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, gave repeated assurances that nothing
in the treaty, or the European Communities (Amendment) Bill authorising
consequential changes in UK law, would affect the government's right to
determine immigration policy.
An unimpressed Mr Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East and a leading
critic of the bill, forecast that the home secretary's assurances would
prove just as ineffective as those given by members of the Thatcher
government during the passage of the single European act in 1986.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers try to calm fears over
army cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR ministers were yesterday working to calm fears among Conservative
backbenchers that British armed forces are dangerously overstretched
worldwide, stressing that there is no need to review the planned Options for
Change programme of defence cuts.
With speculation rising that the UK will be asked formally to police any
United Nations ceasefire in Bosnia, Mr Malcolm Rifkind has privately told
Tory MPs that the UK has the resources to meet its current commitments
without reversing the cuts.
The defence secretary, working to allay fears of further British involvement
in the crisis, is letting it be known that the UK cannot envisage taking on
a major peacekeeping role without a parallel commitment of US ground forces
 -a development thought highly unlikely at present.
However, in an effort to placate opponents of the cuts in the army's
infantry strength, the defence secretary is also insisting that both the
timetable and exact prescriptions for Options for Change have always
included a measure of flexibility within the Pounds 24bn defence budget.
Meanwhile, pressure is mounting from critics of the document for a
government rethink. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence
committee which is preparing a report on the issue, yesterday urged the
government to reverse at least some of the cuts.
Under Options for Change, the Army would be reduced by 40,000 to 116,000,
and the number of infantry battalions from 55 to 38.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MoD dismisses 'erroneous' Rosyth
document
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DOCUMENT suggesting that decisions had already been taken in the highly
political battle over the future of Britain's naval dockyards was described
by the Ministry of Defence yesterday as 'a straightforward clerical error'.
Stronger expressions were, however, circulating within the ministry after
the offending paper was brandished by Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow
chancellor.
As MP for Dunfermline East, Mr Brown is active in the campaign to save jobs
at Rosyth, which is competing with Plymouth's Devonport yard for a guarantee
of survival.
The document produced by Mr Brown appeared to show that the government's
intention, until very recently, was to concentrate vital nuclear submarine
work at Rosyth.
But according to the MoD's embarrassed explanation, this was a mistake. Two
new civil service job openings, it said, were circulated in MoD branches
earlier this month for 'development managers' to take a supervisory role at
the two dockyards. Both dockyards are still government-owned, although they
have been managed since 1987 by private-sector companies.
The posts were specified as being at 'Dockyard A' and 'Dockyard B' - the
former being the winner in the contest, and the latter the loser. However,
the version of the circular that went around the Defence Research Agency, a
semi-autonomous ministry offshoot, named Rosyth as the dockyard taking sole
responsibility for nuclear submarines.
Mr Brown cited this as evidence that 'there was political interference of
some sort which prevented the decision which was to be announced . . being
made.'
If the decision were now to go in Devonport's favour, he said, 'we will
never accept that Rosyth has lost this contract anything other than
unfairly'.
He claimed the document showed that if Rosyth were chosen, both yards would
be able to remain open in the long-term.
The MoD insisted yesterday that no decision had been taken on where to place
the crucial contract for refitting the UK's Trident ballistic missile
submarines.
Mr Gary Streeter, Conservative MP for Plymouth Sutton, described Mr Brown's
allegations as 'absolute rubbish'.
A decision, originally promised by the end of last year, is not now expected
before mid-February.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Call for improved road to pit areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government was yesterday urged to build a dual carriageway through the
Peak District National Park between Sheffield and Manchester to ease the
problems of pit closures in South Yorkshire.
The call came from the Yorkshire and Humberside Partnership, which comprises
the region's offshoots of the Trades Union Congress and Confederation of
British Industry as well as 14 chambers of commerce, Yorkshire and
Humberside Development Association and the regional association of local
authorities.
The partnership wants the present A-road route over the Woodhead pass
upgraded to a dual carriageway.
Such a fast, all-weather road - dual-carriageways are more easily cleared of
snow - would improve access between the coalfield closure areas and
Manchester Airport, boosting prospects for inward investment and easing
congestion on the trans-Pennine M62.
Present direct routes between Sheffield and Manchester are
single-carriageway A roads over the Woodhead or Snake passes, both of which
are often closed by snow.
The cities are less than 40 miles apart but the journey can sometimes take
up to two hours at peak periods, making it slightly quicker to travel twice
the mileage using the M62 and M1.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Offshoots in US 'face tax probe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue is targeting UK companies with subsidiaries that pay high
US tax bills, a leading tax practitioner alleged yesterday.
Mr Terry Symons, a partner with Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, said
Revenue officials appeared to be systematically investigating multinationals
with high US tax bills to see if they should be paying more in the UK.
His concerns follow discussions with the Revenue about one of his clients
under investigation, but he said he was told by senior officials that this
was part of a wider effort to collect more tax.
His statement comes in the week President Bill Clinton has reiterated his
intention to clamp down on foreign corporations which he claims are paying
less tax than their US competitors.
A 1991 analysis - the most recent available - by the US Internal Revenue
Service showed that UK companies paid substantially more tax than many other
foreign and US companies.
US-owned companies paid a total of Dollars 94bn (Pounds 62bn) in 1988,
amounting to 1.1 per cent of receipts and 0.6 per cent of assets. For
UK-owned companies, the proportions were 1.2 per cent and 0.6 per cent. They
were much lower for Japanese, German and Dutch companies.
Mr Alan Reid, a tax partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, said much UK investment
in the US was through the purchase of existing companies. There was much
more scope for transfer pricing - which might reduce US tax bills - for
other foreign countries which simply sold goods manufactured overseas.
Other IRS figures suggest that UK companies are paying three to four times
the levels of tax paid by other foreign companies in comparable industry
sectors.
The Inland Revenue said it would not discuss its tax investigation tactics.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Chairman conjures a compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR MP who brokered the uneasy compromise at the heart of today's
report had expected to spend last Tuesday evening at the Whitbread Book of
the Year awards. Instead Mr Richard Caborn was in Commons committee room 16
chairing a heated meeting of the trade and industry committee.
The collaboration between backbenchers, ranging from old-fashioned knights
of the Tory shires to diehard Labour leftwingers, proved so difficult that
the bearded Yorkshireman at one point indicated that he would resign if a
compromise could not be concocted.
But just before 11pm on Tuesday, the most important select committee report
in years was carried 'nem con'. The outcome spoke volumes for the Sheffield
Central MP's negotiating skills.
The formula may not suggest a reprieve for as many pits as he would have
liked, but it leaves the government with little choice but to scale down
significantly the closures announced last October.
The high-profile inquiry into coal is a far cry from the unhurried
examination of trade with the rest of the EC which Mr Caborn thought would
be his priority when elected chairman last July.
The 49-year-old Mr Caborn's roots lie solidly on the Labour left. In 1981 he
backed Mr Tony Benn for the party's deputy leadership, and plumped for the
Bryan Gould-John Prescott ticket in last year's leadership contest. During
the bitter 1984-85 coal strike he was a staunch supporter of the miners,
serving as a trustee of the Miners' Solidarity Fund. He is a past chairman
of the soft-left Tribune Group and a vigorous opponent of apartheid.
He has drifted into the party mainstream on a range of issues. Once an
out-and-out Euro-sceptic, he is now content to espouse the leadership's
pro-EC stance. An MEP for five years to 1984, he believes his familiarity
with Brussels procedures will prove an asset in his present job.
Regional devolution is an issue on which he sees little room for compromise.
The strength of his views - he has proposed cutting mortgage tax relief to
raise money for regional development - is widely blamed for the loss of his
Labour frontbench place in 1990 after just three years.
He confirms that he then refused a job on Mr Prescott's transport team
because he believed regional policy - for which it was proposed he retain
responsibility - should remain part of the trade and industry portfolio.
Still militant enough to be an early signatory of this week's Commons
early-day motion expressing no confidence in Mr Eddie George, the incoming
Bank of England governor, Mr Caborn mixes earnest discussion with occasional
bursts of humour.
He says chairing a Commons committee reminds him more of being a convener of
shop stewards than a politician. 'You have got to get a solution to the
problem, so you have got to be pragmatic,' he adds.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Obituary of Lord Poole: Senior Tory and ex-FT chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD POOLE, who died yesterday aged 81, straddled the worlds of finance and
politics. He played a key role in the organisation of the Conservative party
during the 1950s and 1960s. At the same time, as the closest adviser to Lord
Cowdray, he was deeply involved in directing the affairs of what was, until
publicly floated, one of the largest privately owned business empires in the
country, the S. Pearson group. As chairman of Lazards, he was for many years
a central figure in the City.
Oliver Poole was born on August 11 1911 and was educated at Eton and Christ
Church, Oxford. After a brief period in the Life Guards he joined a firm of
building contractors in Birmingham, where in the difficult trading
conditions of the mid-1930s he acquired his first direct experience of
financial management. Shortly before the outbreak of war he joined his
family business - Lloyd's insurance broking.
During the war he served with the Eighth Army in north Africa, where he
helped to plan the landings on Sicily and later did the same with 21st Army
Group for the D-Day landings. He was mentioned in dispatches three times and
was awarded many decorations. At the end of the war he was Colonel (Q Plans)
to Field-Marshal Montgomery.
His organisational skills drew him to the attention of the Tory party.
Towards the end of the war, Conservative Central Office asked him to stand
as a candidate and he entered the Commons in 1945 as MP for Oswestry. But he
did not find the life of an MP congenial and quickly decided not to stand at
the next election.
His subsequent backstage role was crucial to the party. Poole had already
had a hand in the pamphlet The Right Road for Britain, which became the
basis of the 1950 election manifesto. In May 1950 he became political head
of the Conservative Political Centre in succession to RA Butler. His
interest in business advanced simultaneously: shortly before leaving the
Commons in 1950 he was asked by Lord Cowdray to join him in running S.
Pearson. The pair had become friends at Oxford, both being members of the
University polo team.
At that time the S. Pearson group faced the problem of adjusting to some
drastic changes which had recently affected its interests. The main aviation
activities had been nationalised, as had been the coalmines and the
electricity utilities. What was left was an assortment of businesses, most
of them sound and profitable but needing to be co-ordinated on a more
rational basis.
Poole helped to formulate a new strategy for the company, selling off some
of the peripheral interests and concentrating on four main lines of
development - banking and finance, publishing, the industrial group centred
on Doulton, and oil. His main personal interest lay on the banking side, and
he was particularly concerned to develop close co-operation between the
three Lazard companies in London, Paris and New York. During the 1960s, he
was credited with instilling a new verve into Lazard's activities in London.
Poole also took an active interest in other parts of the group. He played a
central role S. Pearson's decision to acquire control of the Financial Times
in 1957 and he became chairman of the paper in October 1958 on the death of
Viscount Bracken. He held the post until the end of 1960, when he was
succeeded by Lord Robbins.
He continued to be very much an international figure and in 1972 became a
member of the main Fiat Board. Politics, however, had remained an important
part of his life. In 1952 he was appointed joint treasurer of the
Conservative Party, a post in which his administrative talents, his
profusion of new ideas and his ability to raise very large sums of money
brought him increasingly to the attention of the party's hierarchy.
Poole succeeded Lord Woolton as party chairman in 1955, a post perfectly
suited to his taste for working in the background. He travelled round the
constituencies and forged close ties with Central Office, which were to
serve as the basis for a decade of Conservative party organisation. Poole
was created a baron in 1958 and a Privy Counsellor in 1963.
In 1957 the job of chairman was divided, functionally, between Poole and
Lord Hailsham - Poole quietly working away on improving the efficiency of
the party machine while Lord Hailsham stumped the country making rousing
party speeches.
'Leaving the limelight to others,' Mr Michael Foot wrote later, 'Lord Poole
created the most efficient machine which has ever contested an election in
this country. He knew more about the details in every marginal constituency
than had ever been assembled at a party headquarters before.'
At the end of that period Poole returned to the City, but in 1963 he was
suddenly recalled by Harold Macmillan to serve as joint chairman with Iain
Macleod in the aftermath of the Profumo scandal, when Macmillan's leadership
of the party was under siege. He served in this post for just over a year.
He was known to his closest friends for his great kindness and generosity to
those of other political persuasions. 'He could never stand rancorous
politics,' said one. 'He accomplished great good and kindnesses by stealth.'

FT  29 JAN 93 / Fall in new funds at venture groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUNDS raised by independent UK venture capital companies fell further last
year to Pounds 300m, fuelling fears that there will be a shortage of money
to invest in the late 1990s, Charles Batchelor writes.
The drop from the Pounds 368m raised in 1991 is the third in a row since the
peak in 1989, according to the British Venture Capital Association.
In spite of the sharp decline in fund-raising in recent years, independent
groups - those not part of a larger financial or banking group - had
un-invested resources of Pounds 1.64bn at the start of 1992.
Mr Robert Drummond, association chairman, said the recession meant few
venture companies had attempted to raise money in 1992, but keeping money
flowing in was one of the greatest challenges facing the industry,
Liquidity among independent companies was concentrated in the hands of a few
companies, he said, and concern was increasing that there will be a dearth
of money in the late 1990s.
Independent funds account for 45 per cent of UK venture capital investments,
with the remainder coming from 'captive' funds owned by banks or pension
funds and 3i, the large group owned by the clearing banks and the Bank of
England.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Obituary of Arthur Hellyer: Gardening writer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR HELLYER, garden-ing correspondent of the Financial Times, died
yesterday aged 90 after a short illness. He had lived most of his life in
Sussex and died at the Royal Gardeners' Benevolent Fund Home in Henfield,
West Sussex. He started writing for the FT in the 1950s.
One of the most distinguished careers in British gardening started in 1916,
when the young Hellyer was ordered by his father to dig up the lawn and grow
vegetables because German submarines were threatening British imports.
Hellyer spent three years farming in Jersey before working for eight years
at a general nursery in south-east England. In 1929, he moved from the
potting shed to the printing shop when he became an associate editor of
Commercial Horticulture, moving on to spend 30 years with Amateur Gardening.
He was a fully trained expert, willing to be photographed in sensible
jerseys - sometimes with a reassuring pipe in hand or mouth - to tell
readers exactly how to lay a land drain, dig a trench, or make cabbage crop
fertiliser.
After the second world war, Hellyer was offered the editorship of Amateur
Gardening, which he held for 21 years. His weekly column for the FT began 33
years ago with an article on the definitive art of weed control. Everyone
who knew Hellyer came to admire his clarity, generosity, grasp of science
and knowledge of plantsmanship.
He leaves three children, Peter, Edward and Penelope. His wife, Grace
Charlotte, died in 1977.

FT  29 JAN 93 / SNCF may sue over impact of BR sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SNCF, the French state-owned railway, has strongly hinted that it will sue
the UK government if Britain's rail privatisation plans hit cross-Channel
railfreight.
It says the introduction of track charges could push freight onto the roads
and cause cross-Channel traffic to fall short of levels envisaged in
SNCF/British Rail agreements.
Mr Alain Poinssot, SNCF's freight director, says in a written submission to
the Commons transport committee that the SNCF and BR contract with
Eurotunnel commits them to buying capacity for cross-Channel trains on the
basis of traffic forecasts made in 1988.
He says the creation of a track-owning body charging train operators for the
use of its tracks would be 'completely discriminatory' because road
transport operators face no such charge for the use of the roads.
'In fact, such a policy would preclude the achievement of virtually any of
the traffic goals which formed the basis for calculating the financial
commitments of the two national rail companies vis-a-vis Eurotunnel,' Mr
Poinssot says.
'The financial consequences of this state of affairs would be serious for
SNCF and it would be entitled to ask itself where responsibility lay for the
change in circumstances since the original agreements were signed.'
SNCF's criticisms came as the government attempted to limit the damage
caused by the leak of an internal document raising doubts about the future
of cheap fares and other passenger benefits after privatisation.
The draft submission to ministers, headed 'policy in confidence' and dated
January 7 this year, suggests:
Railcards offering network-wide fare discounts are unlikely to survive under
the new regime because they do not make much money.
Cheap fares between one franchise area and another should be a matter for
negotiation between train operators, not imposed on them.
Tickets for one company's train are unlikely to be valid on another's
'because it runs contrary to commercial interests and trends towards market
segmentation'.
The Department of Transport tried to play down the importance of the
submission, saying it was drafted by a junior official and did not represent
ministerial thinking. However, it was stung into giving an unconditional
guarantee that the national railway timetable would survive.
'We have given an absolute commitment that through ticketing will be
maintained, and privatisation will bring new opportunities for discounted
fares and marketing initiatives,' the department said.

DESIGN elements from the Lotus Engineering bicycle on which Chris Boardman
won an Olympic gold last year are to be used by Leeds-based cycle and
clothing group Casket to make a range of bicycles under licence.
Casket, which claims more than 20 per cent of the UK cycle market through
its British Eagle, Claud Butler, Falcon and Townsend brands, will make and
distribute the cycles under the LotusSport brand through its British Eagle
arm.
The licensing agreement is with Lotus Engineering, the consultancy arm of
Group Lotus, the Norfolk-based sports-carmaker.
British Eagle will make the cycles to Lotus designs incorporating the basic
concept of a one-piece moulded frame.
The machines, expected to be launched in the UK during March, will sell for
between Pounds 500 and Pounds 1,100.

FT  29 JAN 93 / ECGD sees first surplus for 7 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Export Credits Guarantee Department yesterday revealed its first trading
surplus for seven years as a steep fall in provisions transformed a Pounds
754m deficit in 1990-91 into a surplus of Pounds 340m in the 12 months to
March 31 last year.
Mr Brian Willett, ECGD chief executive, said he expected that claims were
likely to fall and that the organisation was likely 'in three to four years'
to become a net contributor to the exchequer for the first time since the
onset of its debt crisis almost a decade ago.
That would contrast with most national export credit agencies which receive
large, often hidden, government subsidies.
It would be seen by the Treasury as a vindication of the sweeping reform of
risk assessment methods almost two years ago even though exporters complain
that the reforms have led to UK export credit premium rates being among the
highest in the world.
The ECGD also revealed yesterday that it is close to concluding deals
selling Tanzanian and Nigerian debts amounting to Dollars 30m (Pounds
19.7m), part of a new strategy to use debt sales to reduce liabilities. The
debts of up to 20 countries are involved. Bids are being invited for Pounds
48m of Egyptian debt.
The Pounds 1.1bn swing in provisions which swept the ECGD into surplus
resulted in the cumulative deficit being trimmed from Pounds 4.62bn to
Pounds 4.28bn. Premium income remained static at Pounds 159m while payment
of claims fell slightly from Pounds 968m to Pounds 954m. These claims,
coupled with notional interest on liabilities amounting to Pounds 371m,
meant that the ECGD's deficit with the Consolidated Fund rose from Pounds
3.11bn to 3.84bn.
The trading accounts were greatly complicated by two factors. First, they
included eight months of operations of the ECGD's former short-term credit
arm, which was sold to NCM, the Dutch export credit insurer, at the end of
1991. Second, they included an effort by the ECGD to separate liabilities
pre-dating the introduction in May 1991 of the Portfolio Management System
of assessing credit risk from liabilities taken on since the system came
into force.
That allows the ECGD to segregate the very high liabilities pre-dating April
1991 which led to special provisions of Pounds 3.8bn in 1990.
'The return to trading surplus does reflect us going through the hump,' Mr
Willett said yesterday.
Improvements leading to lower provisions were reported in Egypt, Poland,
Jordan, Argentina and Brazil. The only significant reversal was in the
former Yugoslavia.

FT  29 JAN 93 / US insurer to take space at Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIGNA, one of the largest US insurance companies, is to transfer part of its
London operations to the headquarters of Lloyd's.
The move underlines growing links between Lloyd's syndicates and insurance
companies - Cigna is the sixth company to rent space at the market's
headquarters in recent weeks.
Cigna's arrival was welcomed by Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, as
'an encouraging sign after our recent difficulties'.
Mr Nick Phillips, general manager of property at Lloyd's, hopes Cigna's
decision might trigger the entry of between 25 and 30 other companies that
are discussing possible moves.
Lloyd's agreed last year to seek corporate capital to participate in
syndicates alongside some 20,000 Names - the individuals who provide its
capital. A number of Lloyd's agencies are examining ways of persuading
institutional investors to back the market's business.
Cigna is understood to have agreed to occupy 400 sq ft at Lloyd's, at a cost
of about Pounds 50,000 per year. It will specialise in insuring casualty and
liability business at Lloyd's.
Mr Alan May, senior vice-president of Cigna, said the Lloyd's building was
popular with brokers and the company hoped to win more business as a result
of moving there.
In a separate development Syndicate Underwriting Management, an insurance
agency owned by the Corporation of Lloyd's, announced yesterday that it has
been appointed to manage the 'run-off' - liquidation - of six syndicates
that have gone out of business over the last 18 months.
Four of the six syndicates involved - 367, 411, 1097 and 1152 - were
formerly administered by the Secretan agency, which ceased trading at the
end of 1991. The other two - 785 and 786 - were formerly managed by Michael
Moss Underwriting Agency. All the syndicates were overwhelmed by claims from
US asbestosis and pollution awards.
Syndicate Underwriting Management was set up in 1987 by the corporation,
which administers and regulates the Lloyd's market, to manage 74 syndicates
formerly managed by the PCW, WMD and Richard Beckett agencies. Turnover is
expected to be at least Pounds 15m this year, compared with Pounds 5.5m in
1992.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Pound devaluation adds 9% to import values
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARP jump in the visible trade deficit last month reflected the impact
of sterling's devaluation on the value of imports. The Central Statistical
Office said that last September's devaluation had so far added about 9 per
cent to import values.
In December import values rose 3 per cent compared with November to a record
high of Pounds 10.9bn while export values were 0.5 per cent lower at Pounds
9.16bn. This left a visible trade deficit of Pounds 1.74bn, the largest
monthly deficit since July 1990. It compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.41bn
in November.
Excluding oil and erratic items such as aircraft and precious stones, which
tend to distort the trade figures, the visible trade deficit deteriorated by
Pounds 222m on the month to stand at Pounds 1.85bn in December.
The trend in export and import volumes was less gloomy. Although import
volumes in December also reached a record high, and export volumes fell, the
three-monthly comparison shows exports rising faster than imports.
In the three months to the end of December export volumes rose 4 per cent
against import volumes which rose only 0.5 per cent. Yet the year-on-year
comparison continues to show imports outstripping exports. Import volumes
rose 7.5 per cent compared with a year earlier while export volumes rose
only 5.5 per cent. But with the lower pound yet to boost export volumes,
there is reason for optimism about exports.
'The volume trends look reasonably favourable,' said Mr Roger Bootle, chief
economist at Greenwell Montagu, the investment house. 'It is right to assume
that the devaluation effect has yet to come through.'
Economists also pointed out that, although high imports were bad news for
the size of the trade deficit, rises among certain goods pointed towards
economic recovery.
The volume of imported consumer durables rose 4 per cent in the final
quarter compared with the third, and were 21 per cent higher than a year
before. Imports of intermediate goods - mainly manufacturers' components -
rose 5.5 per cent on the quarter and were 15 per cent higher than a year
before.
Imports of capital goods were also robust. They rose 6 per cent on the
quarter and 10 per cent on the year.
The value of goods expor-ted to the European Community rose 8 per cent in
the fourth quarter compared with the previous quarter and were 3 per cent
higher than a year before.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Forecasters face long leap into statistical darkness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT six months will test the initiative of industrialists and
economists tracking the UK economy. Yesterday's trade figures were the last
in the current series and there will be no more official data on
intra-European Community trade until the middle of June.
Few appear to have made contingency plans, even though the Central
Statistical Office announced the disruption a year ago. That is hardly
surprising given the difficulties involved.
The old system for collecting data was based on Customs declarations. With
the abolition of border requirements under the single market this system is
now void. The new system will be based on value added tax returns and a
monthly report for bigger companies.
The timing of the interruption is irritating. Almost 60 per cent of the UK's
external trade is generated in the EC and the figures for the first half of
the year would have been especially important for what they could reveal
about the effect of sterling's devaluation on UK trade. 'The timing is
unfortunate,' said Mr Richard Brown, chief economist at the British Chambers
of Commerce. 'We do appear to be at a turning point and we have been arguing
that when it comes it will be export-led. Our quarterly survey has shown a
pick-up in export orders and it will be frustrating not to have that
confirmed by official figures.'
Economists will meanwhile have to make do with a variety of other indicators
from which they may be able to extrapolate trends. The Confederation of
British Industry says it will use data from its industrial and distributive
trades surveys as a partial substitute for the trade figures. It is
considering conducting a special survey in the spring.
Otherwise economists will draw on:
Trade with the rest of Europe. Trade with non-EC countries in Europe, such
as Austria and the Nordic countries, will continue to be published on a
monthly basis. Trade with the rest of the world. These will also continue to
be published but may give a misleading impression. The US economy is
forecast to grow steadily in the first half of this year, but much of
continental Europe is sliding into recession. So exports to the US are
unlikely to mirror the trend in exports to the EC.
CBI and British Chambers of Commerce surveys. The CBI's monthly and
quarterly industrial trends inquiries ask companies about export orders. Its
distributive trades survey asks wholesalers and retailers whether imports as
a total share of trade have gone up or down. The BCC also makes inquiries
about export orders.
Other EC results. Some EC members are planning to produce figures earlier
than June. Regional disparities. Some regions are more export intensive than
others.

<TEXT>
IMPLEMENTATION of the single European market is moving smoothly for most UK
businesses, with most difficulties occurring in other EC states, the Customs
and Excise Department said yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
Mr Mike Rickwood, head of the department's single market unit, said: 'Most
traffic is moving reasonably freely and a lot better than we had feared.'
Companies and professional advisers were reporting that the transition had
been largely effective, but officials admitted there that were still some
problems with the new regime on the Continent, including long delays for
excise goods at the Italian border.

FT  29 JAN 93 / People: Under-utilised at Sears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Lovering, who moved from the post of finance director at Sears to
become managing director of corporate development and international
operations last June, has now resigned to pursue other career opportunities.
At the time, when 43-year-old Lovering was replaced as finance director by
Stephen Park from Hanson, in a move that chairman Geoffrey Maitland Smith
now calls 'largely his (Lovering's) choice', he had said he wanted to take
on a more operational job having been in the finance seat for four years.
But Sears insiders acknowledge he had also regarded himself as a candidate
for the chief executive's seat, which was taken by former BA marketing
director Liam Strong a year ago.
'He felt his talents were not being utilised,' says Maitland Smith who
explains that there has been a change of strategy, which involves
concentrating fully on the UK and putting continental Europe 'not exactly on
the back burner' but demoting it to part of the 'medium-term strategy'.
Lovering will not be directly replaced.
As finance director, he had been closely involved in setting up the joint
venture between Sears' interests in the Netherlands with the German end of
Groupe Andre, the French retailer. 'He loved travelling, visiting the
outposts and motivating people,' says Maitland Smith, who adds that, with
the slowdown in European consumer demand in addition to Sears' setting new
domestic priorities, 'he found he was not doing very much.'
*****
Peter Orchard, the chairman of security and bank note printers De La Rue,
has died. Mr Orchard, 65, joined De La Rue in 1950 and was made a director
in 1963.
He became chief executive in 1977 and took over as chairman in 1987 from Sir
Arthur Norman who had dominated the company for 23 years. He was also a
director of Delta.

<TEXT>
Nintendo, the unparalleled king of the video games market, has been forced
to admit what many beleaguered parents of young games fanatics had suspected
for a long time: that excessive playing of these electronic toys can be
hazardous to your health. But this is only if you have a rare kind of
epilepsy, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
The warnings also say that in some rare cases people may momentarily suffer
convulsions or lose consciousness when they see flashing lights or images on
the screen. The decision to attach the warning was prompted by recent
publicity in the UK and Japan which suggested that video game playing could
trigger epileptic fits.

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stewart Spinks, manager of a Norwich photographic store, got so upset about
the number of customers complaining that their compact cameras caused 'red
eyes' that he decided to do something about it.
His solution is a clip-on flash unit in which the flash bulb is far enough
from the lens to prevent the problem - caused by light bouncing off the back
of the subject's retina.
The Spinks unit, which is to be manufactured and distributed by Jessop of
Leicester, clips on to the camera case and a cover fits over the camera's
integral flash unit. A photo-electric cell in the cover senses when the
integral flash goes off and then triggers the attached flash unit. Jessop:

FT  29 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Housing doubts remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST reports on UK house repossessions and mortgage arrears found a
cautious response in the stock market. Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance, the
two composite insurers most exposed to mortgage indemnity losses, were
unsettled by profits downgrades and a shift of stance by Credit Lyonnais
Laing, the stockbroker.
Mr David Hudson, insurance specialist at Credit Lyonnais, downgraded profits
estimates for both companies. After reviewing the news on repossessions and
arrears, he was less optimistic on the recovery in the mortgage indemnity
business, which has caused heavy losses at both groups.
He lowered his 1993 profits forecast for Sun Alliance from Pounds 63m to
Pounds 25m, moving his stance from 'hold' to 'sell', and for Royal cut his
1993 estimate by Pounds 20m to Pounds 35m and shifted his stance from 'buy'
to 'hold'.
Royal lost 9 to 276p and Sun Alliance 8 to 331p. The former reports 1992
results on February 25 and Sun on April 2.
Recent dollar strength and good results from Marsh and McLennan, the US
insurance broker, prompted keen buying of the insurance brokers, where CE
Heath rose 9 to 347p and Willis Corroon 5 to 205p. Steel Burrill Jones
jumped 15 to 253p.
Rolls-Royce strong
In a strong aerospace sector, shares in aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce
moved sharply forward by 7 1/2 to 125p in brisk trade of 5.8m shares on
strong hints that it had clinched a lucrative engine order from USAir.
The US airliner was said to have ordered 15 Boeing 757s, with an option on
another 15, and they are to be powered by Rolls-Royce's 535 engines. An
announcement of the order is expected today.
However, there were reports that some of yesterday's buying had come from
the US, a factor that does not bode well for Rolls-Royce. Any further buying
from overseas may breach the ceiling of about 30 per cent on foreign
ownership, which was last reported to be around 29 per cent.
Lasmo news
The resignation of Lasmo chief executive Mr Chris Greentree shocked the
market and triggered strong suggestions that his departure could see the
final dividend cut, possibly by half, when the preliminary figures are
announced on March 24. Mr Greentree was regarded as the architect of Lasmo's
expansion in the late-1980s and the acquisition of Ultramar last year.
Lasmo was strong initially, touching 169p amid vague takeover rumours, but
fell sharply to 153p on the resignation news before stabilising and closing
8 down at 155p. Turnover reached 21m, the heaviest day's trade since
September 1988 when British Gas staged an ultimately unsuccessful dawn raid
on the shares.
Dr Rob Arnott at Hoare Govett, who yesterday published a bearish note on
Lasmo, said: 'Until the dividend decision is taken we believe Lasmo shares
will fall further.' Mr Simon Flowers at NatWest Securities said: 'We thought
the chances of a divident cut were 50-50 before this news; now the chances
are much greater.' Mr Fanton Chuck at Strauss Turnbull, said he was
'supportive' of Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo's new chief executive, and that although
the shares 'are still too expensive we are no longer rock-bottom bearish'.
Hanson steady
Conglomerate Hanson, which earns 25 per cent of its profits from tobacco
subsidiary Imperial Tobacco, shrugged off worries over a UK legal settlement
in favour of a passive smoking claim and maintained its recent firm trend.
Analysts said that no amount of bad news could compete with the bare fact
that on a prospective return of 6.2 per cent Hanson shares were yielding
more than cash in the bank. The shares broke through what is considered a
significant 240p barrier on Wednesday, when the company held its annual
meeting. Yesterday they improved a further 1 1/2 to 246p. However, tobacco
groups Rothmans International and BAT Industries were hit by the news of a
Pounds 15,000 out-of-court payment. Tightly traded Rothmans fell 16 to 612p
while BAT lost 12 at 975p.
VAT ruling
News that leisure groups Thorn EMI and Granada had won their appeal against
the UK Customs and Excise office came too late to help the shares, which
dipped 3 to 815p and 4 to 352p respectively. The authorities had demanded
more than Pounds 50m as part of VAT due on the companies' rental businesses.
The companies made no provision in last year's accounts for the possibility
of losing the appeal and some analysts had drawn attention to the
nervousness in the shares while the outcome of the legal ruling was awaited.
The well-signalled rights issue from Asda finally arrived, with the
supermarket group making a three-for-10 cash call to raise Pounds 347m. The
market was very receptive to the move, with the company stressing its desire
to accelerate its refurbishment and new store programme.
Asda's accompanying statement that profits would be at the top of market
forecasts sent analysts reaching for their pens. BZW increased its 1994
forecast from Pounds 144m to Pounds 190m. The shares strengthened 5 to 67
3/4 p with 78m shares dealt in the market and the equivalent of a further 5m
changing hands in the form of traded options. However, some specialists
expressed surprise at the strength of the rest of the food retail sector -
which suffers a lot of switching between stocks - in reponse to the Asda
move.
Dealers reported little new enthusiasm for the stories suggesting a rights
issue at Burton Group, although there were hints that the company's advisers
may have struggled to find sufficient support for a cash call. Burton
appreciated 1 1/2 to 75p.
Hotel group Stakis attracted attention with improved results, a rights issue
and a big disposal. While analysts were satisfied with the group's recovery
from its financial difficulties, the sale of its nursing homes raised doubts
over the longer term strategy. The shares added 4 at 45p. Analysts upgraded
forecasts to a range of Pounds 7m to Pounds 10m for next year.
Among metals and engineering stocks, British Steel was heavily traded and
saw turnover of 20m shares as the stock firmed 2 1/2 to 71 1/2 p. The demand
was said to have come after a bullish presentation at BZW.
Vague talk of financial worries at BM Group led to a sharp retreat for the
shares early in the day. At the day's worst they were down 49 but they later
recovered to close 10 off at 50p. The improved outlook for the motor trade
led to strong demand for truck manufacturer ERF and the shares jumped 30 to
200p.
Construction and housebuilding issues were given a big boost by a Credit
Lyonnais Laing note recommending eight of the housebuilders as strong buys.
The broker's housebuilding research team, in its outlook for 1993 and 1994,
said it expected housing starts to increase by 8 to 10 per cent and house
prices to stabilise.
Laing recommended Barratt, 2 firmer at 116p, Bellway, 2 up at 345p,
Berkeley, 10 higher at 351p, Persimmon, 10 to the good at 225p, Wilson
Bowden, 3 firmer at 393p, Wilson Connolly, 3 better at 154p, and Wimpey, 5
higher at 122p.
Continued speculation that the Al Yamamah 2 defence order from Saudi Arabia
was about to be announced boosted British Aerospace and the shares moved
forward 8 to 235p.
A stock overhang continued in BAA and the shares fell 10 to 780p. Some
attributed the the weakness to switching out of BAA and into British
Airways, which closed 6 1/2 higher at 277 1/2 p.

FT  29 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices under further pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market looked decidedly uneasy yesterday, and investors
continued to take profits ahead of the close tonight of a two-week trading
account which has seen the FT-SE 100 Index rise by nearly 2 per cent.
Dealers in government bonds, on the other hand, are believed to have lost up
to Pounds 20m following the auction of gilt-edged securities held in the
wake of Tuesday's cut of one percentage point in UK interest rates.
Sentiment in the equity market was helped at first by a relatively steady
performance from sterling and government bonds. But early gains in shares
melted away in the face of a widely predicted batch of rights issues and
lack of genuine investment buying to offset the profit-takers.
The mood was not helped by discouraging news from the corporate sector,
where the departure of the chief executive of Lasmo, the North Sea oil
group, revived worries over the outlook for the market's dividend yield
prospects.
Also unsettling for the market was the announcement of a sharply increased
deficit of Pounds 1.54bn on the UK trade account in December.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 was 15.6 off at 2,816.9, virtually the low of
the day. But the FT-SE Mid-250 Index shed only 1 point to 2,963.5. Volume in
non-Footsie stocks jumped to around 67 per cent of the day's Seaq total of
828.9m shares, compared with 56 per cent in the previous session.
Wednesday's 753.5m-share Seaq total was worth Pounds 1.48bn in retail
business, at the top end of the recent range of daily averages.
Rights issue nervousness in the stock market proved well-founded following a
call for Pounds 347m from Asda, the food supermarket group. and for Pounds
28m from Stakis, the UK hotel company. The expectation of more rights issues
continued to overhang the market. It is an open secret that only
underwriting difficulties have restrained other UK companies from bringing
cash demands into the stock market.
Much of yesterday's trend in equities was dictated by the stock index
futures sector. Profits were taken in building materials, stores and brewery
stocks, but there was renewed demand for the construction and contracting
shares which have led the market advance over the past two trading sessions.
Aerospace issues strengthened significantly as UAL, the US airline,
announced contract policies.
Reverberations of this week's reduction in domestic interest rates to 6 per
cent continued to sound round the stock market, not always to a favourable
reception. While suggestions of further base rate cuts at Budget time in
March remained favoured, doubts were widely expressed regarding the
political handling of this week's move.
Some analysts suggested that the Footsie might now not be far from the high
of the year. Tough measures in the Budget are now thought more probable and
any good news may now be in the market.
Strategists at NatWest Securities commented that the latest cut in base
rates, while unexpected, indicated that a further reduction to 5 per cent is
likely and that this should provide further short-term upside for the stock
market. But the authorities were 'somewhat naive in the unsympathetic timing
of the base rate cut, as far as gilt-edged marketmakers are concerned',
NatWest added.

FT  29 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADERS OF stock index futures reported a dull session after an early
squeeze petered out, leaving the market to drift gently lower, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The first trade in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 2,840,
well below Wednesday's close of 2,854. But following a brief lull a squeeze
developed as traders moved to cover short positions and the contract quickly
moved ahead to 2,858.
That strong demand ran out of steam mid-morning and thereafter March drifted
lower, mainly due to a lack of trading activity, and helped to pull the
underlying cash market down.
March fell to the day's low of 2,829 over the lunch-time period and
continued to drift during the rest of the afternoon, although a few bargain
hunters were seen ahead of the close.
The contract ended at 2,836, down 18 from its previous close and around 13
points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. The lack
of activity was clearly reflected in the turnover, which was a mere 6,299
contracts.
In traded options, volume returned to more modest levels, reaching 29,033
lots. The FT-SE 100 option had 5,176 contracts traded. Asda was the most
active among the stock options, with big selling of both the July 70 puts
and the July calls. The closing total for Asda was 5,303.

FT  29 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Modest Dow gain on mixed
economic data

Wall Street
US EQUITIES edged higher yesterday, although the gains were relatively
modest in the wake of mixed economic news, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 14.86 up at 3,306.25, although the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was only 0.55 firmer at 438.66. Secondary stocks
continued to slip, with the Nasdaq composite closing 3.23 lower at 694.67.
New York SE volume was 257m shares.
There was encouraging news from the Commerce Department, which reported that
gross domestic product was up 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter on a
seasonally adjusted annual rate, above market predictions of 3.1 per cent.
Enthusiasm for the GDP numbers, however, was tempered by a report that
initial claims for state unemployment insurance had risen by 2,000 in the
week ended January 16 to 364,000; a decline of 9,000 had been expected.
American Express declined a further Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 22 3/8 in active
trading. Investors remained concerned about turmoil within the group's top
management - three key members of the board of directors resigned on
Wednesday over the decision of Mr James Robinson to remain chairman of the
group and to take over the running of its Shearson Lehman brokerage
subsidiary.
Trading was also heavy in Service Merchandise, a catalogue and showroom
merchandiser. The stock plunged Dollars 4 to Dollars 11 1/8 after the
company posted flat fourth-quarter net earnings of 88 cents a share.
Analysts had expected earnings of 99 cents in the latest quarter.
Delta Air Lines eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 51 following a second-quarter
net loss of Dollars 3.04 a share against a deficit of Dollars 3.89 a year
earlier. The airline also cut its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share from
30 cents. UAL, parent of United Airlines, tumbled Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars
122 1/4 on a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 9.27 a share compared with
Dollars 10.69 last year. The company also said it was cutting 2,700 jobs.
On the Nasdaq market, technology issues continued to run into profit-takers,
with Intel retreating Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 109.
Sun Microsystems receded Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 37 7/8 in early trading
before recovering to end a net Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 38 5/8 . Some
analysts have reduced their ratings on the stock following disappointing
second-quarter earnings.
Lotus Development, the personal computer software maker, climbed Dollars 2
to Dollars 23 3/4 in the morning on news of fourth-quarter net income of 35
cents a share, but fell back to end only Dollars  1/8 ahead at Dollars 21
7/8 .
Canada
TORONTO again finished slightly softer following active trading. The TSE 300
index lost 3.7 at 3,307.9 and declines led advances by 316 to 289 after
volume of 46.2m shares.
Moore, down CDollars 2 at CDollars 19 1/2 , said it will take a pre-tax
restructuring charge of about CDollars 77m in fiscal 1992 and implement
various programmes to reduce personnel and eliminate redundant assets.

up 6 at 3,405.

FT  29 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei clears 17,000 on
interest rate hopes

RENEWED hopes of a cut in the official discount rate and active buying by
life assurers bolstered sentiment, and the Nikkei average surged by 3.4 per
cent, clearing the 17,000 level for the first time since December 29, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index moved lower in early trading, falling to the day's low of
16,471.76, but moved ahead on late afternoon buying, hitting the day's best
of 17,086.79 just before closing 553.73 ahead at 17,063.41.
Volume rose from 220m shares to 300m, the highest since December 18.
Advances overwhelmed declines by 862 to 123, with 128 issues unchanged, and
the Topix index of all first section stocks climbed 31.77 to 1,291.87. In
London, however, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 1.20 to 1,049.12.
Short-covering by dealers and active buying by public funds and foreigners
also pushed up share prices. Rumours that financial authorities and
politicians were trying to oust Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan
governor, who has been seen as leading the opposition to easier monetary
policy, prompted hopes of a discount rate cut.
Some market participants speculated that the sudden surge was prompted by
the Ministry of Finance, which has been nervous over recent market talk of a
February crash. 'It seems as if the MoF is doing some arm-twisting,' said
one analyst.
Shipbuilders stayed active on calls by the Transport Ministry for
regulations to prevent oil spills, including requirements for tankers to
have double hulls. Sasebo Heavy Industries rose Y18 to Y543, Mitsui
Shipbuilding put on Y20 at Y387 and Hitachi Zosen gained Y26 at Y516.
Interest rate-sensitive electric power issues gained ground. Tokyo Electric
Power moved ahead Y70 to Y2,570 and Tohoku Electric Power advanced Y80 to
Y2,440.
Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, rose Y14 to Y364 on
speculative buying by dealers on the 'restructuring' theme, which also
lifted Oki Electric by Y11 to Y386.
High-technology issues gained on short-covering. NEC, which had been weak
recently on earnings worries, advanced Y33 to Y650 and Pioneer Electronic
added Y130 at Y2,400. Mitsubishi Electric, which weakened in the morning on
reports of lower than expected earnings, rebounded to finish Y8 up on
balance at Y493.
In Osaka, the OSE average put on 405.02 at 18,290.36 in volume of 51.2m
shares. Roundup
TOKYO'S rise left some Pacific Rim markets unimpressed.
HONG KONG was marked broadly lower amid selling by overseas funds after
renewed Chinese attacks in the Sino-British row. The Hang Seng index shed
135.39, or 2.28 per cent, to 5,804.50 in volume of HKDollars 2.58bn, up from
Wednesday's HKDollars 2.03bn.
Bank of East Asia's 36 per cent increase in 1992 profits, announced shortly
after the afternoon session opened, was below some estimates. The shares
slipped 25 cents to HKDollars 35.75.
AUSTRALIA staged a slow advance after the release of data showing the annual
inflation rate at just 0.3 per cent; but share prices fell away towards the
close after the federal government downgraded its 1992-93 economic growth
forecast to 2.5 per cent from 3.0 per cent.
The All Ordinaries index ended barely above the day's low, down 8.1 at
1,526.7. Turnover was a light ADollars 230.64m.
SINGAPORE failed for the second successive day to sustain an intra-day
record high. The Straits Times Industrial index touched 1,607.91 in morning
trade but profit-taking left it a net 4.84 down at 1,598.23. Volume improved
to 65.47m shares from Wednesday's 56.86m.
Singapore Press Foreign moved forward 60 cents to SDollars 15.70 amid
reports of analysts rerating earnings and rumours of a cover price rise.
SEOUL's composite index declined for the third day in a row, by 6.78 to this
month's low of 687.79.
MANILA was firmer and the composite index appreciated 16.56 to 1,340.90 in
higher turnover of 4.3bn shares, compared with Wednesday's 2.4bn.
KUALA LUMPUR was generally lower, with the composite index weakening 6.48 to
finish at 618.41.
Tenaga shed 30 cents to MDollars 9.20 in active trade, while Telekom lost 50
cents to MDollars 13.
BANGKOK saw selling of leading bank stocks and the SET index slipped 8.87 to
974.54.
BOMBAY climbed again on budget hopes, the BSE index rising 50.23 to 2,645.36
in hectic trading stimulated by this week's visits by Mr John Major, the
British prime minister, and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president.

FT  29 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Analysts ease early pressure
on steels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STEEL groups came under early pressure yesterday after the US announced that
it was imposing tariff duties on imports from seven EC countries, writes Our
Markets Staff.
However, some analysts commented that this measure might have less effect on
the sector than instinctive reactions had suggested: the EC only exports
about 3.6 per cent of its total steel production of some 136m tonnes to the
US.
BRUSSELS saw steel stocks recover in late trading: Cockerill, which had been
as low as BFr89 closed just BFr1 weaker at BFr94 after saying that it had
little exposure to the US. The group also announced that it was to lift
prices by between 15 and 20 per cent, in line with increases that have
recently been announced by other European producers. Clabecq was flat at
BFr366 after seeing BFr345; and Arbed regained BFr1,980 after BFr1,920,
BFr15 down on the day.
The Bel-20 index was 2.43 higher at 1,180.88 in turnover of BFr1bn.
AMSTERDAM fell back as Hoogovens reacted to the US decision, easing 80 cents
to Fl 26.10 but off the day's low of Fl 25.30. The CBS Tendency index lost
0.5 to 97.2. Daf remained suspended at Fl 7.20: after the close the
government said that 'several more weeks' were needed for the restructuring
plans to be finalised.
FRANKFURT reversed early losses in the face of poor inflation figures from
Hesse and bleak company news from Thyssen, the DAX index finishing 5.52
higher at 1,567.84 after a low of 1,556.36. Dealers, once again, gave the
credit for the recovery to thin trading and the influence of the derivatives
market. Turnover rose from DM4.6bn to DM4.8bn.
In the steel sector, shares showed little reaction to US plans to levy
duties on steel imports. Thyssen ended DM1.50 higher at DM171, but it had
fallen DM7 on Wednesday, anticipating yesterday's forecast of a further
deterioration in 1992/93 results. In engineering, KHD fell DM1.80 to DM100
as it confirmed that a rights issue was on the way.
PARIS was generally firmer although Alcatel Alsthom, went against the trend
with a FFr15 fall to FFr610, reflecting disappointment after a forecast of
flat earnings in 1993. The CAC-40 index closed 3.29 higher at 1,780.64, off
the day's low of 1,755.90, in turnover of some FFr3bn.
BSN was one of the main risers, up FFr11 at FFr923, after estimating a 5 per
cent increase in 1992 earnings and saying that it was optimistic about the
current year, while Cap Gemini advanced FFr8.30 to FFr148.30 after reporting
a net 1992 loss of FFr80m, down from FFr560m in 1991.
The banking sector remained weak after Standard and Poor's said on Wednesday
that it was placing a number of banks on its creditwatch list. Suez shed
FFr4.00 to FFr256.50 and Paribas lost FFr1.20 to FFr373.80.
MILAN saw institutional investors emerge as bargain hunters after a weak
opening and the Comit index finished 2.36 lower at 478.02.
Fiat fixed L160 lower at L4,100 but recovered to L4,170 after hours as the
market awaited the group's preliminary 1992 results. In the event, chairman
Giovanni Agnelli's letter to shareholders, released after the close,
revealed better operating income than expected but a worse net debt
position. IFI, the parent company dipped L350 to L9,500.
Montedison continued lower, losing L55 to L1,100, on concern that ENI, its
former joint venture partner in Enimont, may press for up to L800bn
reimbursement and unconfirmed reports that a warrant had been issued for the
arrest of a former chairman over a contribution to a political party.
ZURICH pulled up after the previous day's lows and the SMI index ended 8.5
higher at 2,072.6. Swissair gained SFr22 to SFr507 as investors welcomed its
exploratory talks with KLM on possible cooperation. Adia fell SFr27 to
SFr168 after announcing plans to cut its equity capital to cover projected
1992 losses of SFr203m.
MADRID, the best performing market in Europe after some three weeks of 1993,
took a critical look at itself and dropped the general index by nearly four
points in the morning before it recovered to close 2.18 lower at 229.57.
Construction stocks led the declines with Cubiertas losing Pta150 to
Pta3,850, Dragados Pta45 to Pta1,285 and FCC Pta400 to Pta8,000. STOCKHOLM
fell on worries in the banking sector and the Affarsvarlden index lost 13.9
to 879.1. Turnover was some SKr679m after SKr565m. Electrolux B slipped SKr5
to SKr210 ahead of its 1992 results.

FT  29 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Athens regains confidence on EC funding
package / A new mood among investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Greek politicians still argue about which projects to include in an
infrastructure programme made possible by EC funding, the prospect of
Ecu20bn (Dollars 16bn) flowing in from Brussels over the next seven years is
already contributing to a recovery on the Athens Stock Exchange.
Cement and construction issues have shown sharp gains and a small
engineering group, for instance, whose shares were rarely traded, suddenly
found itself accounting for more than 1 per cent of daily orders fed into
the bourse's new electronic trading system.
As a result the general index has gained momentum, closing yesterday at
741.35, up nearly 8 per cent from the start of the year. Volume has also
climbed steadily over the past few weeks, reaching Dr1.7bn (Dollars 8m) at a
number of sessions.
Mr John Markopoulos, managing director of Sigma Securities, says: 'It is a
cautious sort of recovery; but it is clear that confidence is returning
after a rather long gap. Investors have woken up to the fact that
price-earnings ratios are low, around seven to eight on average.' This
compares with a p/e of between 10 to 11 times at the start of 1992.
The announcement in December of the second EC package, with its guarantee of
sustained public investment, could not have come at a better time. . A
prolonged slide during most of 1992 took the general index to a 32-month low
in November. Even after a 27 per cent jump in just four weeks, the index
showed a loss of 17 per cent on the year.
The year-end figures revealed a depressing picture, with market
capitalisation declining in 1992 by 11 per cent to Dr2,042bn. The total
value of share transactions plunged by 31 per cent to Dr306bn, with average
trading volume down to around Dr1.2bn.
Even listed companies shunned the market as a source of capital, with
several leading industrial groups preferring to raise fresh funds through
issues of corporate bonds. Only two small investment companies joined the
bourse in 1992, compared with 17 entrants the previous year.
To a large extent, the small investors who are normally responsible for a
high percentage of turnover on the Athens exchange were tempted away by
attractive interest rates offered on government paper.
Although inflation was at 14.4 per cent in December, the need to finance the
bloated public deficit kept this month's rate for one-year Treasury bills,
by far the most popular investment instrument, as high as 22.5 per cent.
Nevertheless, as the government's economic stabilisation programme enters
its third year, inflation is forecast to decline faster, dropping to 9 per
cent by the end of the year. A fall in interest rates, currently standing at
about 27 per cent, is also expected, gathering speed after the summer.
Mr Dimitri Verropoulos, an investment consultant at Alpha Brokerage, says:
'The economy is starting to get back into shape and the outlook for growth
is encouraging. Institutional investors from abroad are looking at Athens
again.'
The real test for the market this year will come when the government
launches a series of privatisations through the stock market.
Housing Bank and Bank of Central Greece, both subsidiaries of large
state-controlled banks which are already listed, are to be sold through
public tender offers on the exchange. This method has already proved
successful in the sale earlier this month of Bank of Athens, a subsidiary of
National Bank, to a Korean-owned investment group.
However, these listings will be small by comparison with the projected
offering this summer of a 14 per cent stake in OTE, the state
telecommunications group. The flotation is set to follow the planned direct
sale of another 35 per cent of the company to an international telecoms
operator.
The government hopes to raise about Dr100bn from the partial flotation of
OTE. But concern is already being voiced over whether the market can absorb
such a large issue. Analysts point out that the country's largest public
offering to date, launched when the market was riding high in 1991, raised a
total of Dr20bn.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Sudden pressure on franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR, the French franc and sterling all recovered ground against the
D-Mark in European trading yesterday afternoon after a sudden surge of
tension inside the European exchange rate mechanism earlier in the day,
writes James Blitz.
A strong wave of selling of the Irish punt raised fears that the ERM might
be destabilised by another devaluation, and this triggered pressure on the
French franc in the early morning.
The French currency fell by more than a centime against the D-Mark in the
first hours of London trading, bottoming out at FFr3.3950. Three-month
French cash was quoted at between 12 3/4 and 13 1/4 per cent, nearly a full
point above its level on Wednesday night.
Sterling also came under pressure, falling as low as DM2.38 against the
German currency by midday, nearly 2 pfennigs under its close on Wednesday.
The Irish punt continued to trade below its ERM floors against the Belgian
franc and Dutch guilder, in the wake of the UK's 100 basis-point cut in base
rates on Tuesday.
Several factors triggered a recovery in the afternoon. The first was an
annualised 3.8 per cent rise in fourth-quarter GDP in the US, compared to
3.4 per cent in the third quarter. The figure took the shine off the D-Mark,
pushing the dollar up to a London close of DM1.5855, a full pfennig above
its low of the day. In New York it finished at DM1.5860.
President Bill Clinton helped the dollar bulls by saying before a meeting
yesterday with the Federal Reserve chairman that growing redundancies at
major corporations were increasingly troubling. This encouraged the theory
that he will introduce a fiscal boost to the economy, possibly compensated
by higher interest rates.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, eased tensions by saying in
Brussels that he hoped German inflation would be at 3 per cent this year.
This was seen by some analysts as a more emollient stance on inflation,
although a 3 per cent target for the end of 1993 has already been given by
Bundesbank council members.
Both events helped the French franc to recover to FFr3.385 by the European
close. Sterling rallied to a close of DM2.4050, up  3/4 pfennig on the day.
Against the dollar it was firmer at Dollars 1.5165, while in New York it
ended at Dollars 1.5155.
The Irish punt was still below its floors against the Belgian franc and
Dutch guilder after ERM trading officially closed at 4pm yesterday.
Mr Avinash Persaud of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London said the punt's 20 per
cent overvaluation against the D-Mark was unsustainable. But Ireland's
resistance to devaluation may be helped by EC redevelopment grants amounting
to Pounds 270m this year. 'This allows Irish exporters to enjoy a dual
exchange rate structure, helping them endure cuts in profit margins,' he
added.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Money Markets: French cash rates rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rates in the French franc cash market firmed sharply yesterday
morning as tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism triggered a
sudden burst of pressure on the French currency, writes James Blitz.
Until yesterday, there had been a strong feeling in the market that the Bank
of France would use the renewed calm in the ERM to lower its official
interest rates.
However, as the franc fell to FFr3.3950 against the D-Mark, dealers wondered
whether the Bank might have to push its overnight lending rate above 12 per
cent at its regular Thursday intervention.
In fact, the Bank left its rates unchanged. But three-month cash was quoted
at between 12 3/4 and 13 1/4 per cent, its highest since the currency crisis
of last September.
There was also another steep fall in the March French franc futures contract
as dealers reined in predictions of a sharp easing in German - and hence
French - monetary policy before the spring.
The March contract dropped 40 basis points to 88.60, but later picked up to
88.68. A dealer said the fall might have been greater had protesting car
workers not invaded the Paris Bourse, bringing an early close to trading in
the Matif.
The market is now pricing three-month French franc interest rates in
mid-March at 11.32 per cent, a remarkably high level given yesterday's
figure for consumer price inflation to December of 2.0 per cent.
One interesting feature of yesterday's trading was how the March Euromark
contract rose 8 basis points, closing at 92.01, as the French franc futures
came down. Traders seemed to be saying that the more pressure there is on
the franc, the more likely it is that the Bundesbank will ease policy.
The 15 basis-point cut in the Bundesbank's repo rate earlier this month
still convinces the market that the Bundesbank will do its utmost to avoid a
devaluation of the franc or suspension of the ERM.
In the sterling market, cash rates eased slightly as a large shortage of
Pounds 1.8bn was easily removed by the market.
The interbank market may not have taken on board the need to push rates down
to levels compatible with 6 per cent base rate. Three-month money declined
by  1/32 percentage point to 6 1/4 per cent. The one-year rate slipped  1/16
to 6 per cent exactly.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia to raise domestic gas
prices by up to 200%

RUSSIAN DOMESTIC gas prices will be increased by up to 200 per cent on
February 1 in an effort to make them catch up with past inflation, Mr Rem
Vyakhirev, chairman of Gazprom, the Russian state production company said
yesterday. Prices to consumers will rise to Rbs600 (about 79p at the present
market) per 1,000 cubic metres from a current level of Rbs216.
Mr Vyakhirev said internal gas prices must be raised closer to world prices
to fulfil Gazprom's urgent need for investment capital to develop new gas
fields. 'But as soon as you ask for a higher price, everyone thinks you're
the enemy of the people, politically we are walking on a knife edge.'
Mr Alexander Margulov, director general of Yamburggasdobuycha, Gazprom's
production arm in Yamburg, western Siberia, believes that internal gas
prices will have to rise to Rbs1,000 per 1,000 cu m to enable the company to
cover its development costs 'with a very narrow margin'. Gas prices have
been kept artificially low but Gazprom is lobbying for them to be raised
more quickly in line with inflation, which last year in Russia was running
at 2,200 per cent. Mr Vyakhirev said Gazprom needed Dollars 8bn to Dollars
9bn for new field development over the next five years - the company cannot
calculate its capital needs in roubles as the rapid pace of inflation makes
the figures meaningless.
The company has secured Dollars 2.8bn in credit from western banks and is in
discussions with a group of German banks including Deutsche Bank and
Kommerzbank about a further Dollars 1bn. In addition to investment credits,
Gazprom receives about Dollars 2bn a year in hard currency from gas sales to
the west. The company said it could use this to buy equipment such as large
diameter pipes and horizontal drilling equipment that was not available in
Russia.
Gazprom has plans to increase its production of gas by 50bn cu m by 1995 to
between 690bn and 695bn cu m a year. Last year, Russia produced 640bn cu m
of gas and Gazprom accounted for 94 per cent of that. This year the company
plans to pump about an additional 8bn to 10bn cu me.
Output will be increased mainly by a rise production from the Yamburg field
in western Siberia and the recent start-up of new fields such as Yubilejnoye
and Komsomolskoye to the south of the Urengoy region. Gazprom's Urengoy
field in western Siberia - the world's largest gas field - produced 287bn cu
m of gas last year and the company says it can maintain this level of
production up to 1997. But Mr Reim Suleimanov, director general of Urengoi
Gazprom, says it will be unable to maintain production beyond that date
without additional investment to bring new fields on stream.
Mr Suleimanov is looking at developing four new satellite fields to augment
output from Urengoy. The satellite fields include Pitsovoye, Yen Yakha,
North Urengoy and Zapolyarnoye to the north east of the Urengoi cluster. A
feasibility study of the North Urengoy field has indicated an initial
development cost of between Dollars 200m and Dollars 350m.
Mr Suleimanov says he would like to explore partnerships with foreign
companies for development of the four new fields. Bechtel, a US resources
company, has drilled two test wells in North Urengoi. 'Without foreign
investment, I can hardly see these fields being developed,' he says.
Gazprom's Moscow headquarters is less eager, however, to see foreign
investors taking stakes in new fields. 'We don't want to make the same
mistakes as the oil industry,' said Mr Vyakhirev, yesterday. He pointed to
the need for foreign involvement to provide technology or equipment not
available in Russia, or for more exploration data on fields already
discovered, but he expected no gas production or transmission joint
ventures.
Russia's gas industry is one of the country's great - perhaps the only  -
success stories, western observers say. Mr Suleimanov believes this is
because of a powerful inertia in the gas industry, which keeps on producing
in spite of lack of investment. In addition, Mr Vyakhirev stressed: 'We've
done nothing (in the way of investment) in the past three years, we need to
make up for that in the next four years'.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Work to start on Swiss group's
Tatarstan oil venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PRIVATELY-owned Swiss company is about to start development of an oil
project that could eventually raise output by more than 20 per cent in
Russia's second largest producing region.
The autonomous republic of Tatarstan's 1992 production of about 650,000
barrels a day place it behind only Siberia in Russia's oil league, and it
has vast unexploited reserves. The republic's authorities have so far
authorised four joint ventures for oil exploration and development. One
involves Total, the big French oil company, but the other three are with
relatively small companies such as the Swiss-based Panoco, which derives its
income principally from oil operations in Nigeria.
Panoco announced last week that the 'Blue Kama' joint venture, in which it
and Tatneft, the Tatarstan oil and gas authority, each have a 50 per cent
stake, is about to start development of eight oil fields in a 31,750-hectare
(78,460-acre) area. The area's proven reserves have been upgraded from
1.69bn to 2.61bn barrrels since the joint venture accord was signed in 1991.
The first output, from 35 wells, is expected to come on stream in April and
a longer-term plan involves drilling about 2,770 wells over 14 years,
raising total output to 150,000 barrels a day from the present 2,000
barrels.
Panoco says the project will involve a total investment of up to Dollars
1.2bn, most of which will come from operating profits after the first three
years.
Initially, Panoco plans to raise about Dollars 80m, half of which is to
finance a new 93 km (58 mile) pipeline to link the new field to the oil
treatment facilities at Almetyevsk. From Almetyevsk oil flows through the
existing network to other parts of Russia and, via the Druzhba pipeline, to
eastern Europe.
Under the terms of the joint venture agreement Blue Kama will export all its
oil output until the initial investment is recouped. Subsequently, both
partners are free to decide where to sell their half-share.
The joint venturers are also studying the feasibility of building an oil
refinery close to the Blue Kama area. Tatarstan currently has no refining
capacity of its own and meets its own domestic needs by importing refined
products from neighbouring republics.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cut likely in international
rubber pact support price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MEETING of the international natural rubber organisation here today seems
likely to agree on a cut in the group's buffer stock reference price despite
a recent upward swing in the market.
The reference price, which takes into account production and market
conditions, determines when Inro's buffer stock manager should buy or sell
rubber as part of efforts to stabilise prices.
Inro rules stipulate that the reference price must be cut by 5 per cent if
the average Inro daily market indicator price over the previous six months
is below the 'may buy' level - at present set at Malaysian cents 176 a
kilogram.
Prices of natural rubber have risen in recent weeks because of a rise in
world demand and the start of the wintering, the low production season, in
many parts of south-east Asia, the world's main rubber producing region.
But the Inro six month average is still just below the 'may buy' mark and
traders say the market has already discounted for a cut in the reference
price.
Inro stockpiles of rubber now stand at about 160,000 tonnes.

COPPER prices fell back in late trading on the LME, with a less-active
market unable to sustain earlier rises. News that Chile's El Teniente could
process concentrate from Enami's Ventanas smelter if a strike took place
took the shine off the market. ALUMINIUM was firmer, helped by news that
Russia might crack down on tolling of metal by Western firms. GOLD held
steady on the London bullion market, but sentiment remains bearish and
dealers expect the market to retreat towards support at Dollars 328.
London's robusta COFFEE market closed with small losses in quiet but nervous
conditions as dealers waited to see if there would be any resumption in the
recent sharp decline. It appeared to be delicately poised with some
believing the market should now start to rebuild after this week's rapid
fall. New York COTTON prices were still ahead in late trading after a mild
technical bounce following the declines earlier this week. But prices
remained under severe technical presssure.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper smelter to expand
capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRODUCTION CAPACITY at Spain's Huelva copper smelter will be expanded by 20
per cent, from 150,000 tonnes of metal to 180,000 tonnes, by 1995 under the
terms of a deal for Freeport McMoRan, the US natural resources group, to
take a majority shareholding.
The smelter is the principal asset of Rio Tinto Minera and Freeport will pay
about Dollars 54m for a 65 per cent interest in RTM, subject to several
conditions being satisfied.
The deal is an important element in Freeport's strategy for its
rapidly-growing copper-gold complex in Indonesia. The US group is also
involved in a Dollars 545m copper smelter project in Indonesia, of which
Metallgesellschaft of Germany would be the majority shareholder and
operator. Freeport would supply only half that smelter's concentrate (an
intermediate material) so it has been looking for more 'captive' smelting
capacity and the Spanish plant, which at present treats about 450,000 tonnes
of concentrates a year, fits the bill.
RTM at present is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ercros, the troubled
industrial group 39-per-cent-owned by the Kuwait Investment Office's Spanish
holding company.
Freeport's Indonesian subsidiary has agreed to sell some of the present
infrastructure and some still to be built at its mining complex in the
highlands of Irian Jaya to the ALatief Corporation for about Dollars 200m.
ALatief has retail, property management, real estate, manufacturing,
agriculture and hotel operations in Indonesia. Freeport says in future
ALatief will provide a major part of the non-operating services to its
mining operations.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc and lead prices rise on
Australian group's output cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>

ZINC PRICES jumped by more than 5 per cent when trading started in London
yesterday after Pasminco, the Australian natural resources group, said
market conditions were forcing it to restructure its loss-making zinc and
lead mining operations at Broken Hill, with the loss of 500 jobs.
Lead prices also moved up as analysts calculated that the restructuring
would remove roughly 25,000 tonnes a year of zinc and about 32,600 tonnes of
lead from the market.
Some analysts suggested, however, that the higher prices would be
short-lived unless other producers followed Pasminco's example.
Mr William Adams, analyst at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural
resources group, said: 'It is rather surprising that this news has had such
an effect. I would expect selling to come in when the market has
reconsidered.' He suggested the higher price levels would not be sustained
'unless there are more cuts and the market is certainly nervous about this
possibility.'
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, a subsidiary of the Westpac banking
group, pointed out, however, that, although Pasminco's production cuts did
not look very substantial when compared with zinc stocks of nearly 1m tonnes
or lead stocks of about 640,000 tonnes, they would have an important impact
on market supply and demand this year.
He calculated that, if nothing else changed, the expected statistical supply
deficit in the zinc market this year would increase from 50,000 to 82,000
tonnes while 'at one stroke the lead supply surplus is eradicated.' Mr Moore
said that 'at today's prices' more zinc production cuts must be expected.
On the London Metal Exchange zinc for delivery in three months reached
Dollars 1,127 a tonne in early trading, an eight-week peak, before closing
at Dollars 1,115.25, up Dollars 40.75. Three-month lead closed up Pounds
7.375 a tonne at Pounds 295.50.
Pasminco said its Broken Hill operations were too inefficient to operate
profitably at current low world prices for lead and zinc, in spite of
capital investment of ADollars 304m since 1988.
It said the northern operations, previously scheduled to close in 1995,
would shut immediately because of mounting losses and the poor economic
outlook in Australia and other developed countries. The remaining southern
operations were to be restructured to increase production to 3,000 tonnes of
ore a year from each employee, from about 1,500 tonnes a year.
This would boost production at the southern operations to 2.4m tonnes a year
compared with current production of about 2.6m tonnes from the combined
operations.
Asset write-downs, redundancy payments and restructuring were expected to
cost about ADollars 40m before tax. Pasminco said in October that it
expected to return to profitability in the year to June, following two years
of heavy losses.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Barter deals help to bridge CIS
grain gap / A way that has been found round the region's debt problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US grain industry is in a peculiar position. Its best customer is
strapped for cash, has a cumulative global debt in the area of Dollars 80bn
and is Dollars 245.9m in arrears on US government-guaranteed loans for grain
already purchased. Worse, the customer, the former Soviet Union, is
struggling toward democracy and is a wounded giant in need of assistance.
Rather than abandon the Commonwealth of Independent States entirely, the US
Department of Agriculture has quietly found a way to resume selling wheat to
Russia and its surrounding Republics. Longer-term solutions to Russia's debt
problems may be working their way through the new government in Washington,
but until then, barter is gaining currency in the world wheat trade.
The US has sold 1.4m tonnes of US wheat to CIS countries since September
under a little-known barter clause of its much larger Export Enhancement
Program. When Russia's failure to meet US loan payments shut down mainstream
credit programmes in late November, EEP barter sales increased markedly.
Initial allocations for the special programmes provided for 500,000 tonnes
of US wheat for the CIS, but when that allocation was exhausted, additional
allocations were transfered from Russia's 5.5m tonne overall EEP allocation.
Russia still has 1.75m tonnes of EEP credits to draw upon, according to USDA
officials.
The programme allows a third-party country to buy US wheat to balance a
barter transaction, perhaps oil or metals, with a CIS country. To date
Uzbekistan, rather than Russia, has been the primary barter recipient. The
most recent sale was recorded yesterday - 110,000 tonnes of wheat for
shipment between February and April.
The switch to barter, rather than credit or cash arrangements by the grain
trade to the CIS is not surprising. The countries are resource-rich and cash
poor, and still very much in need of imported grain.
In a report issued today, the International Wheat Council called for grain
exporting countries to try new solutions to the CIS's credit problems.
'Given the overwhelming importance of the CIS market, it seems likely that
the major exporting grain exporting countries will seek every more inventive
ways of servicing it,' the report said. 'The alternative could be a total
default on current debt,' it added.
Russia has been awaiting new credits for 2.5m tons of cereals from France,
but terms of the guarantees have stalled the deal. Canada, the world's other
large wheat exporter, long ago suspended wheat shipments to the CIS.
The IWC has projected that the CIS would import 28m tonnes of grain in the
1992-93 marketing years, down from 37.8m last year.

cocoa prices

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRUCTURAL surplus in the world cocoa market from 1984-85 to 1990-91 is
at an end, but prices are expected to recover only slowly to the year 2,000,
according to a new study by the International Cocoa Organisation, Reuter
reports.
The 1991-92 shortfall should begin a period when deficits outnumbered
surpluses, it said.
Production and consumption should continue to grow, but much more slowly
than during the last decade. The fall in stocks due to the predominance of
deficits is expected to result in a recovery in prices in real as well as
nominal terms.

UK GOVERNMENT bond prices rose by as much as a point on hopes that interest
rates would be cut again soon and by the market's perception that the Bank
of England would not issue more paper until the latter part of March.
The market's strength enabled the Bank to sell a large part of the Pounds
550m of stock that it announced on Tuesday. Both the Pounds 100m of 2.5 per
cent index-linked stock due 2001 and the Pounds 300m 8 per cent gilt due
2003 have been exhausted, and dealers expect the Pounds 150m of 2.5 per cent
index-linked gilts due 2009 to be sold in the next few days.
The Liffe March gilt futures contract, which opened at 101.00, rose to
102.00 as the contract broke through a chart resistance point.
It ended at 101.31 in volume of 47,737 lots.
GERMAN government bond prices rose in the afternoon as the slide in the
Irish punt raised hopes that the Bundesbank would have to cut interest rates
in order to stabilise the ERM.
The market's strength, in spite of poor inflation data from the state of
Hesse, surprised many dealers who were forced to cover their short
positions.
The Liffe March bund futures contract rose to 92.91, up 11 basis points in
volume of 46,967 lots.
THE yield on 10-year Dutch government bonds fell below those on German
10-year bunds by as much as four basis points during the day as good
economic fundamentals encouraged demand for Dutch paper.
However, some dealers reported switching from Dutch into German paper on
hopes of a cut in German interest rates.
The new 7 per cent 2003 bond closed at 99.51 up from 99.43 to yield 7.07 per
cent.
IRISH government bond prices were volatile as the high cost of funding
short-term trading positions following the rise in the overnight lending
rate to 100 per cent made it difficult to get firm prices from dealers. 'The
market is very sensitive at the moment,' one dealer said.
The benchmark 9 1/4 Capital stock due 2003 was quoted half a point down at
97.00.
ECU-denominated government bond prices were depressed by the renewed tension
within the ERM, in spite of the success of the French treasury's auction of
Ecu680m worth of 10-year OATs earlier in the day.
This marked the first sovereign issue in Ecus since Denmark rejected the
Maastricht treaty last June. The yield on the new 10-year OAT rose to 8.22
per cent from its average yield at auction of 8.19 per cent.
US TREASURY prices firmed yesterday in spite of fresh evidence of stronger
economic growth.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 105
1/16 , yielding 7.203 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 100 1/8 , to yield 4.168 per cent.
The market opened firmer in the wake of a report from the commerce
department that gross domestic product rose 3.8 per cent in the fourth
quarter last year. Although the increase was larger than expected, and
confirmed that the economy recovery was in full swing at the end of 1992,
analysts said that the market chose to focus on the news, in the GDP
figures, that the implicit price deflator - an important measure of
inflation - rose by just 1.7 per cent in the final three months of last
year.
Treasury prices were also buoyed by a rumour that Goldman Sachs, the
securities house, was recommending an asset allocation switch out of stocks
and medium-term Treasuries. The market came off its highs when Goldman
denied the story.

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: UK-Dutch link suggests Europe
options network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE process of greater co-operation between European derivatives exchanges
will advance a step further on Monday when the planned link between OM
London and the European Options Exchange in Amsterdam starts to operate.
It will be the first real-time trading and clearing link between independent
European exchanges. But if plans and negotiations bear fruit, it could be
the first of a series of links, ultimately creating a network of European
futures exchanges which allows members of one exchange access to a broad
range of European markets.
Initially, EOE members will be able to trade and clear options on the OMX
Swedish stock index, while OML members will have access to options on the
Eurotop 100 index and the EOE-Index, made up of 25 Dutch shares, creating
cost savings of as much as 50 per cent, according to Mr Lynton Jones, chief
executive of OML.
Earlier this month, Germany's Deutsche Terminborse and France's Matif
announced the most important co-operation pact between European exchanges to
date. They aim to implement the first step of the agreement - the
installation of DTB terminals in Paris allowing Matif members to trade DTB
bund futures - by the beginning of next year.
The trading link between OM and EOE is the first in a series of linkages
planned by First European Exchanges (FEX), an alliance created last year by
EOE, OM London and OM Stockholm, Soffex in Switzerland and Otob in Austria.
The alliance 'should give exchanges access to each others' membership
without creating additional clearing costs,' said Mr Jones of OML.
Links between Soffex and OML and between OML and Otob are being developed,
and could be in place by the end of the third quarter. A further link
between OML and Otob would then be implemented: it is technically the most
straightforward, since the Otob exchange uses the OM screen trading system.
In addition, other smaller European exchanges may join FEX: Italy's Mif and
Spain's Meff are the likeliest candidates. The Matif and the DTB have said
that they would welcome discussions with other exchanges.
As the process gains pace, Liffe, Europe's largest exchange, which offers a
broad array of European products, appears increasingly isolated. However,
Liffe is in discussion over a link with the Chicago Board of Trade, and is
considering joining Globex, the after-hours trading system.

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Bonds: First collared issue in sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RUSH of new issues in sterling and both US and Canadian dollars dominated
market activity yesterday.
The most innovative deal of the day was a Pounds 100m 10-year issue for the
Leeds Permanent Building Society, the first issue of collared floating-rate
notes in the sterling sector.
The collared structure incorporates a minimum interest rate (floor) and a
maximum interest rate (cap). Investors are offered floating-rate notes which
pay more than current money market rates, but will not benefit from rises in
rates above the level of the cap.
Close to Dollars 8bn of collared floating-rate notes have been issued in the
dollar market in the last six months. The steep yield curve in the US market
has made it possible to buy caps and floors in the derivatives market, and
use them to subsidise the cost of the issue to the borrower, while offering
the investor an initial coupon higher than current money market rates.
The one-point cut in the UK base rate to 6 per cent on Tuesday finally made
the structure viable in the sterling market, by causing the yield curve to
steepen, according to lead manager Salomon Brothers.
The Leeds deal offers a minimum coupon of 7 per cent,  7/8 point higher than
the six-month London interbank offered rate, and a maximum of 11 per cent.
More UK building societies and banks are expected to take advantage of the
structure, because of the opportunity to reduce funding costs.
Meanwhile, the Royal Bank of Scotland took advantage of strong demand for
longer-dated sterling bonds among UK institutions to launch a Pounds 150m
20-year issue of subordinated bonds, priced to yield 140 basis points more
than the comparable UK gilt.
Bayerische Landesbank, the German regional bank, also raised subordinated
debt in the sterling market. The Pounds 100m issue of 10-year bonds,
arranged by SG Warburg, was priced to yield just 37 basis points over the
comparable gilt. However, because it is backed by the Bavarian state,
Bayerische Landesbank's subordinated debt benefits from the same triple-A
rating as its senior debt, so that investors make little distinction between
the different tiers of debt.
Both deals will count as lower tier two capital under the new international
capital guidelines which came into force this month.
Buying in dollar securities remains strong, and General Electric Capital's
second Eurobond offering this week sold out rapidly. The Dollars 250m issue
due 1999 was arranged by UBs Phillips &amp; Drew.
Swap opportunities in the Canadian dollar sector prompted three new issues,
but dealers said that supply was likely to outstrip demand in the sector.
KFW, the German agency, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
and Bayerische Vereinsbank, the German Bank, tapped the market for CDollars
700m.
Moody's Investors Service, the US credit ratings agency, will review
long-term debts of Bank of Yokohama, which owns Guiness Mahon Holdings, the
UK merchant bank, and Ashikaga Bank, both rated at A1, due to concerns over
the banks' real estate related lending, writes Emiko Terazono from Tokyo.

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Wall Street celebrates the
arrival of spiders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE spiders will be suspended above the trading floor of the American
Stock Exchange in downtown Manhattan this morning as it celebrates the
launch of Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary Receipts (SPDRs), known as spiders.
The new product allows investors to track the performance of the S&amp;P 500
stock index, and is aimed at luring business back to the ASE that has been
lost to stock index funds - low-cost funds, sold by big investment groups,
such as Fidelity and Vanguard, that are designed to match the investment
returns of stock market indices.
The chief attraction of spiders is that they mimic the performance of a
stock index fund but, because they represent shares in a trust that holds
all the important S&amp;P stocks, investors can buy and sell them quickly.

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ercros to receive Pta6bn from
sale of mining unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ERCROS, the chemical group in receivership which is 36 per cent owned by
Grupo Torras, the Spanish investment arm of the Kuwait Investment Office, is
to sell its Rio Tinto Minera mining unit to Freeport McMoRan, the US
minerals group, for Pta6bn (Dollars 54m).
Mr Mahmoud al-Nouri, Torras chairman, said Torras had written off the
Dollars 800m it had invested to acquire Ercros in the late 1980s and the KIO
did not consider itself be 'involved' in the chemical group.
Meanwhile, the debt-burdened Torraspapel which is Spain's leading paper
producer and is fully-owned by Torras began a series of negotiations with 22
creditor banks aimed at injecting short-term funding into the company.
The banks have recently reduced discount lines totalling Pta19bn to Pta5bn.
Mr Al-Nouri warned that the banks risked endangering their loans if the
negotiations failed.
'They should maintain their credit lines and increase them.'
Torras is to loan Pta2bn-worth of KIO funds to Torraspapel, and ICO, Spain's
state credit agency, has provided medium and long-term credit lines worth
Pta15bn following the presentation of cost-cutting measures by the company.
These will reduce its labour force of 8,900 by more than 25 per cent.
Mr al-Nouri said that Torras intended to sell the paper group once it was a
viable business.
In another development involving KIO, a boardroom clash looked likely last
night at Ebro, Spain's biggest food group, over Torras' plans to sell the 36
per cent stake that it owns in the company.
This disposal is contested by Mr Javier de la Rosa who was owns 12 per cent
of the food producer and who resigned as Torras' deputy chairman shortly
before Mr al-Nouri was appointed chairman of the holding company in May last
year.

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Campbell extends hostile bid for
Arnotts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAMPBELL Soup, the US food group, yesterday extended its hostile bid for
Arnotts, the Australian biscuit maker, after failing to reach its target of
50.1 per cent of the shares.
Campbell said holders of more than 14 per cent of Arnotts' stock had
accepted its ADollars 9.50-a-share offer, taking the group's shareholding to
just over 47 per cent.
Campbell said the bid would remain open until February 5 to allow
shareholders who have not accepted the offer to reassess their position. The
bid values Arnotts at ADollars 1.3bn (USDollars 928m).
'This is our last and final extension and we are confident of continuing
support from shareholders,' said Mr David Johnson, Campbell's
Australian-born chief executive.
Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts chairman, claimed some shareholders had been misled
by Campbell's earlier statements that the offer would not be extended.
He said the group was considering asking the Australian Securities
Commission, the corporate regulator, to force Campbell to allow shareholders
to withdraw acceptances.
'We have already been contacted by shareholders who claim that they were
misled and wish to withdraw their acceptances,' he said.
Arnotts said it had been assured by most members of the founding families,
which owned some 26 per cent of the company when the bid was launched, that
they would refuse to sell. Most financial institutions rejected the bid
yesterday, including the AMP Society, Australia's largest stock market
investor, National Mutual Life and Legal &amp; General of the UK.
Campbell's increased shareholding will entitle the group to lift its
representation on the Arnotts' board from two to three. However, a 1985
shareholding agreement between the companies means Campbell must acquire
more than 85.1 per cent of Arnotts' shares before it can control the board.

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Steel groups hit by fall in
demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MULHEIM, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO big European steel groups - Thyssen and Usinor Sacilor - made results
announcements yesterday which underlined the weakness of demand within the
industry.
Thyssen, a German industrial and trading group as well as a significant
steel producer, reported a 14 per cent fall in sales for the first quarter
of this year, as it steel divisions suffered dramatic losses caused by
falling demand and low prices.
Incoming orders for the first quarter fell by 12 per cent to DM8.2bn
(Dollars 5.4bn).
Mr Heinz Kriwet, president, blamed the setback on the continued decline in
the steel side which reported a 16 per cent fall in turnover for the
quarter.
Mr Ekkehard Schulz, president of Thyssen Stahl, said he did not expect
results in the steel divisions to improve significantly in the second
quarter of the year.
Thyssen Stahl recently lost a contract with Opel, the German subsidiary of
General Motors, for 30,000 tonnes of steel products to a consortium of steel
producers including Klockner, the west German producer, Ecostahl of east
Germany, Arbet of Luxembourg and Cockerill of Belgium.
For the year ended September 1992, net profits for the Thyssen group tumbled
to DM350m from DM520m a year earlier. Sales for the period were 2 per cent
lower at DM35.7bn.
The steel divisions lost money last year, but the group's other two main
business showed improvements.
Sales for Thyssen Industrie, Budd, the US subsidiary, and Wulfrather Gruppe
climbed by 6 per cent to DM12bn for the year.
Losses at Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steelmaker, last year fell
to FFr2.4bn (Dollars 452m) from FFr3bn in 1991, the group estimated
yesterday.
The loss, which came on a 10.8 per cent decline in sales to FFr86.7bn
reflects a continuing decline in steel demand and prices, said Mr Francis
Mer, the chairman.
Usinor Sacilor had trimmed output to adjust the fall in demand, but did not
expect its result to improve in the first half of this year.
However, it did expect to feel the benefits of price rises for flat steel
products from the second quarter of 1993, said Mr Mer.
The group reduced its workforce by just over 7,000 last year to 90,800.
Of this, 4,400 were job losses in France, among the biggest workforce
reductions in the French public sector and a serious worry to the
government.

<TEXT>
TAROM, Romania's state-owned airline, has become the latest east European
carrier to opt for privatisation. It has appointed a team led by Samuel
Montagu, the UK merchant bank, to draw up a feasibility study.
Tarom is the largest company to be considered for privatisation so far under
Romania's pilot privatisation scheme, launched last year. It joins a long
list of east European airlines who have sought to modernise their operations
through privatisation.
A consortium led by Air France recently took a 40 per cent stake in CSA, the
former Czechoslovak airline. It was followed by Alitalia, which bought a 35
per cent stake in Malev, the Hungarian airline.
Tarom, which recently took delivery of two Airbus A310 aircraft, said it
hopes to find a foreign partner to help finance the modernisation of its
fleet but indicated the state was likely to retain a significant minority
stake.
Tarom has secured financing for five Boeing 737-300s due to be delivered by
August and hopes to buy eight more by the end of 1994. It operates a fleet
of 54 aircraft, nearly two-thirds of which are Russian-made.
Tarom flies to 40 international locations and expects to make a profit of
Dollars 4.3m for 1992. It registered a turnover of Dollars 47m over the
first nine months of the year.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Deal on oil seeks to defuse trade tension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL intends to buy an annual Dollars 500m (Pounds 328.9m) of oil from
Argentina, in an attempt to defuse tension surrounding a growing trade
surplus with its neighbour, Brazilian officials indicated yesterday.
The officials said a 'political decision' had been made for Petrobras, the
state oil company, to buy the oil, but that negotiations were continuing on
details of the purchase.
Brazil's trade surplus with Argentina reached about Dollars 1.4bn last year,
with Brazil's exports worth just over Dollars 3bn.
Brazilian exports have been stimulated by the two countries' contrasted
exchange rate policies. Argentina has fixed its exchange rate against the
dollar, which has led to a real appreciation of its currency, while Brazil
is devaluing the cruzeiro in line with its inflation rate.
The weakness of Brazil's economy, which showed almost no growth last year,
has forced manufacturers to look increasingly towards exports.
The new political intervention has been prompted by strains that the issue
is placing on Mercosur, the southern cone trade group in South America. The
organisation, which also includes Paraguay and Uruguay, has agreed to
abolish internal trade barriers by the end of 1994.
Alarm at the growth of Brazilian imports led Argentina in October to treble
to 10 per cent a tax on nearly all imports. The move has already led to
protests by Paraguay under Mercosur's new disputes procedure.
Brazil is willing to sign an investment protection agreement with the UK, Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the Brazilian foreign minister, indicated to
British officials in London yesterday.
The details of a proposed accord, which may be the first of its kind to be
signed by Brazil, are being examined by the UK government.

FT  29 JAN 93 / American Steel Tariffs: US not planning a steel war yet -
Clinton administration may look at the fairness of its own trade laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHORT statement by Mr Ron Brown, the new US commerce secretary, was easily
lost amid the cries of outrage which greeted Wednesday's steel dumping
decisions.
'These determinations follow mandated procedures and other results of
exhaustive investigations; as such they are not policy statements,' he said.
After one week on the job, the Clinton administration has found itself 'on a
train which had already left the station' as far as steel is concerned, said
one Washington analyst. The Commerce Department and US trade representative
still lack the deputies, under secretaries and assistant secretaries whose
influence will be vital in designing and implementing trade policies.
US officials have been at pains to emphasise that Wednesday's decision was
preliminary. The Commerce Department will make its final determinations
between April 12 and mid-June. The International Trade Commission will then
have 45 days to decide if the imports have caused injury to the US industry.
Where President Bill Clinton has had to be specific - on supporting the
North American free trade agreement - he displayed a willingness to take on
domestic interests, and the labour unions, for the sake of a forward-leaning
policy. It will not be conducive to good relations in North America if the
final decision is to impose dumping duties of 49-76 per cent on Mexican
steel and up to 68.7 per cent on Canadian steel.
The Canadian government has reacted to the steel cases in a way bound to
grab the attention of the new administration. Three weeks ago it found
American steel companies guilty of dumping steel plate. Today it is expected
to find the US guilty of dumping hot rolled steel.
Mr Frederik Pelmer, chairman of Stelco, the largest Canadian-based steel
producer, drove the point home at a press conference in Washington on
Wednesday. 'This kind of tit-for-tat action is ridiculous,' he said. 'It
diverts our attention, our time and our money from dealing with the real
structural challenges facing the steel industry in North America.'
Canada's swift and strong response illustrates the danger foreseen by many
US trade experts. The use of 'unfair' trade laws is spreading and providing
a tool for protection-minded industries the world over.
With the US industry in jeopardy, the administration may take a closer look
at the fairness of its own trade laws. They give the Commerce Department
considerable discretion in how it determines dumping and subsidies. More and
more studies are finding those formulas skewed towards the domestic
industry. Critics complain that the US dumping law punishes foreigners for
pricing behaviour that is no different from that of US companies, or that
does not really distort trade patterns.
Another common criticism was voiced on Wednesday by the American Institute
for International Steel, which represents importers. The dumping margins
were overstated because they are based on distorted exchange rates.
The Clinton administration may agree to negotiate another round of
'voluntary quotas'. Or it may move to reform its trade laws. The much-abused
'policy wonks' now in power have to be given time to study their options.

THE Korea Iron and Steel Association said the US dumping ruling 'destroyed
the free steel trade order'.
Korean steel exports to the US last year amounted to Dollars 725m (Pounds
476.9m), accounting for 13.8 per cent of the country's total steel exports.
The dumping duties on four steel products, including a 30 per cent penalty
on Korean hot-rolled steel sheets, would affect almost two-thirds of its
steel exports to the US.
Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), Korea's biggest steel company, was the most
seriously affected by the duties imposed on four Korean companies. Posco
mainly provides hot-rolled steel to UPI, a California-based, 50-50 joint
venture by the Korean state steel company and USX.
Posco hopes to compensate for the threatened lost exports to the US by
increasing shipments in east Asia.
The other Korean steel companies affected include Dongbu Steel, Dongkuk
Steel Mill and Union Steel Manufacturing.
In an attempt to avoid other trade problems with the US, the Korean
government said yesterday it would enforce protection of intellectual
property rights. The US has complained about lax protection of such rights
in Korea, including illegal use of software, trademarks, and copyrights.

FT  29 JAN 93 / American Steel Tariffs: EC tries to step back from
confrontation

THE European Community yesterday stepped back from confrontation with the
Clinton administration over the US Commerce Department's decision on
Wednesday to impose stiff anti-dumping penalties on carbon steel producers
from 19 countries.
In remarks which tempered earlier condemnation of the decision to impose
preliminary duties, the EC made clear that it did not wish to paint the new
administration in Washington as protectionist.
'We do not believe there has been an ideological change,' said a spokesman
for Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner. He guardedly welcomed a
statement from Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, that the anti-dumping
decision was based on mandated legal procedures, and was not a new policy
statement from the Clinton administration.
The Commission effort to calm the firestorm of criticism appeared aimed at
leaving Sir Leon plenty of room for manoeuvre when he meets Mr Mickey
Kantor, his US counterpart, in Washington on February 11. It may also have
been aimed at averting unnecessary public attacks which could jeopardise
already-fragile prospects for an agreement in the Gatt global trade talks.
However, Eurofer, the European confederation of iron and steel industry,
condemned the duties as 'extremely serious' for the future of international
trade, as well as being unjust, unacceptable and arbitrary.
In Paris, an angry government threatened to push for a EC complaint to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the US duties.
The move would block all French and German steel exports to the US, claimed
Mr Francis Mer, chairman of Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel
group which is the world's second largest producer.
That represented a loss of Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) annual exports for
European steel makers, including FFr1.5bn (Pounds 182.3m) of sales from
Sollac, Usinor Sacilor's flat products division. If confirmed, the duties
would also force Usinor Sacilor to shed more jobs, on top of the 7,000
people who left the group last year.
In Germany, Mr Rupert Vondran, head of the German Steel Federation,
denounced the US decision as blatantly protectionist and called on the
German government and the EC to confront it with firm action.
He said the US measures would affect 600,000 tonnes of German steel exports
worth just under DM500m (Pounds 205.7m). A further 6m tonnes of products
from other steel producers barred from the US would increase pressure on
European markets and exacerbate the problems which have thrown the European
steel industry into recession, he said.
He said German steel companies had already curbed their deliveries to the US
last year. They remained 40 per cent below quotas allocated to them by the
US administration.
The US was trying 'to settle domestic problems at the expense of foreign
trade partners'. He said price leaders on the US markets were not foreign
steel importers but the local mini-mills, which enjoyed favourable costs and
had lifted market share from 14 to 24 per cent in the last few years.
In London, the department of Trade and Industry described the US measures as
'protectionist' and 'an outrageous harassment'.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had written to Mr Brown
saying the move was unjustified and disproportionate.
Privately, senior EC officials were seething yesterday at the US decision,
which comes as Europe's steel producers are suffering from falling prices
and cheap imports from eastern Europe.
They expressed most irritation at the way EC producers had been penalised
during a period including the 10 years to March 1992, when a 'voluntary'
restraint agreement for steel between the US, the EC and other leading steel
exporters was in force.

THE preliminary ruling by the US that Japan and 18 other countries have been
dumping steel products in the US triggered dismay and a flurry of protest
yesterday from the Japanese authorities and the steel industry.
Both the foreign ministry and the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (Miti) promptly issued statements expressing deep regret at the
rulings and called on the US authorities to make 'truly impartial judgments'
in reaching their final ruling in April.
Mr Hiroshi Saito, president of Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel
company, and chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, said the
Japanese steel industry had made serious efforts to ensure orderly trade
with the US and would continue to press its claim that Japanese imports were
not being dumped in the US and were not harming the US industry.
The Japanese authorities and industry officials warned that the massive
filing of anti-dumping and countervailing petitions could adversely affect
the relationship between the Japanese and US steel industries and pose a
serious obstacle to progress in agreeing rules for world steel trade through
the Multilateral Steel Agreement negotiations.
The steel ruling, in the wake of reports that the Big Three car makers are
preparing to file dumping actions against imported cars and suggestions that
the new administration of President Bill Clinton may revive the Super 301
provision of the US Trade Act, has fanned fears in Japan of growing US
protectionism.
Concerns about a protectionist administration in the US has already led to
widespread public debate in Japan over what the country needs to do to
defuse tension with the US.
While publicly the authorities say it is too early to tell what trade policy
the new US administration will adopt, recent official statements indicate
that Japan may adopt a more assertive stance in putting its case forward in
trade disputes with the US.
Both Miti and the foreign ministry claimed yesterday that the problems of
the US steel industry stem largely from domestic causes.
'It is. . . difficult for Japan to consider that Japanese steel products
could have damaged the US steel industry at the time when the VRA (Voluntary
Restraint Arrangement) was in place until the end of March last year,' the
foreign ministry said.
Japanese exports of steel to the US have been falling, and the uncertainty
surrounding the anti-dumping petition by US steelmakers last summer has
already stalled steel trade negotiations with the US, Japanese industry
officials said.
If the preliminary ruling and dumping margins of 15 to 27 per cent are
upheld when the US makes its final ruling, Japan could see its steel exports
to the US halved.
The Japanese authorities make it clear that they intend to examine whether
the US determinations on steel are consistent with the Gatt provisions, the
implication being that if they are not, and if the final ruling by the US
remains affirmative, Japan may refer the issue to Gatt.
Earlier this week, Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, director-general of Miti's
international trade policy bureau, suggested that the revival of Super 301,
which allows the US to impose sanctions on Japan unilaterally, could lead to
retaliatory action by Japan in line with the Gatt regulations.

<TEXT>
CHINA has returned to the offensive against Hong Kong Governor Chris
Patten's blueprint for political development in the colony, accusing Britain
of duplicity and warning Mr Patten to back down, writes Simon Davies in Hong
Kong.
The accusations ended a three-week lull in a dispute which had resulted in a
sharp rally in local stock prices. The comments were published in an
interview given to the pro-Beijing Mirror magazine by Mr Zhou Nan, China's
most senior representative in Hong Kong.
The Hang Seng Index yesterday fell 134 points, or 2 per cent, as investors
interpreted the statements as a sign that China wants to shatter local
confidence before the Patten blueprint is put before local legislators in
late February.
Zhou, director of the Hong Kong branch of the New China News Agency, claimed
Britain was using Hong Kong to bring about political change within the
mainland, saying it should find a way to back down.
'If the so-called package they put forward this time is meant to sound out
China's determination on matters of principle, now is the time for them to
wake up,' Zhou said.
In addition to the Zhou interview, Mirror magazine printed a
hitherto-unpublished November speech by China's 88-year patriarch Deng
Xiaoping, in which Deng said there was no question of compromise.
'If any superpower wants to interfere in China's affairs with these tricks
to attain some political aims, we will fight to the end. On matters of
principle, we cannot concede even an inch,' Deng was quoted as saying.
Mr Robin Hammond, associate director of Wardley James Capel, said: 'China
has a vested interest in making sure there is not much confidence in Hong
Kong before the LegCo vote. The quickest way for them to hit Hong Kong
confidence is through the equity market.'

FT  29 JAN 93 / Cathay Pacific strike ends as labour law debate escalates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S first significant industrial dispute since the 1970s has all but
ended, with the management of Cathay Pacific Airlines saying more than 90
per cent of its 4,000 flight attendants are available for work.
The 15-day strike has highlighted glaring inadequacies in the colony's
labour laws, at a time when Governor Chris Patten's push for further
democracy has led to expectations of far-reaching change from the
administration.
The dispute commenced after cabin attendants temporarily filled junior
positions during staff shortages - three air hostesses were dismissed when
they refused to comply, sparking a wildcat strike by the Flight Attendants
Union.
It soon escalated into a debate over the right of workers to go on strike.
Hong Kong labour laws provide no protection for management or staff. Cathay
Pacific claims the strike was the work of a few trouble-makers and is
calling for new legislation.
This is being echoed by the strikers, who were threatened with
'disciplinary' action if they did not return - management has the legal
right to dismiss them for breach of contract.
So far the government reaction has been muted. Mr Albert Chan, spokesman for
the United Democratic party, said: 'If there is no action taken by the
administration, I would have to question the spirit of (Mr Patten's) policy
speech.' The party has been Mr Patten's staunchest supporter in the colony's
Legislative Council.
The strike took place during Hong Kong's busiest holiday season, the Chinese
New Year, when more than 1m people leave the city. Cathay Pacific spokesman
Mr Rowland Cobbald said the company would continue chartering flights over
the weekend to cope with heavy demand, but he claimed that normal flight
schedules would resume by the start of next week.
The strike cost Cathay as much as HKDollars 20m (Pounds 1.6m) a day. Mr
Sheldon Kasowitz, director of Jardine Fleming Asia Research, said: 'We will
be reducing our 1993 profits forecast by HKDollars 250m, to reflect the cost
of the strike. On that basis, it is hard to argue that the management has
won this battle.'

FT  29 JAN 93 / US keen to avoid UN action against Israel
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government said last night it opposed any early moves against Israel
at the United Nations following the approval by the Israeli High Court of
the expulsion of more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon. The US called for
more time to resolve the issue diplomatically.
The unanimous decision by the court's seven judges prompted a call by the
Palestine Liberation Organisation for the urgent imposition of sanctions to
force Israel to abide by UN Security Council resolution 799, which demanded
expulsions be reversed.
But Washington, despite backing resolution 799, is anxious to avoid any
further deepening of a crisis which threatens the future of Middle East
peace talks. 'We're in the process of consulting with the Israeli government
on next steps, which can resolve the issue,' said Mr Richard Boucher, State
Department spokesman. 'Those diplomatic efforts have to be given a chance to
succeed. We don't think it's time for a debate in the Security Council on
sanctions.'
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Prime Minister, said the cases of all the
deportees would be reviewed by the authorities, but otherwise gave little
sign of compromise. He said he looked to the US to protect Israel at the UN.
'This has been the policy of all presidents and all administrations of the
US. Certainly that is what I expect.'
Mr Rabin said he believed peace negotiations would resume and succeed. But
Palestinian leaders and Arab governments said the high court ruling damaged
peace efforts. The PLO repeated it would not return to talks until the
deportees went home.
The court said the expulsion of the 415 alleged Islamic fundamentalist
militants was legal under an emergency regulation promulgated in 1945 under
the British mandate. Although annulled by Britain, Israel continues to
recognise mandate orders. The high court rejects the UN insistence that the
fourth Geneva convention, which bars expulsions, applies to the occupied
territories.
It said a new expulsion order issued when the Palestinians were banished in
December was illegal. But it nevertheless upheld the individual orders
against the men as legal under the 1945 regulation.
The court insisted that those expelled be able to appeal personally against
their removal. But it accepted the government's submission that it could
expel them without the right to prior appeal under the prevailing
circumstances. The expulsions followed a spate of killings of Israeli
soldiers by Islamic militants.
The army said it would provide facilities for appeals in Lebanese territory
it occupies close to where the deportees have been camped for six weeks. The
deportees say they will refuse to appeal.
Some Israeli lawyers said the rulings opened the way to further mass
expulsions. Palestinians said they showed that the Israeli legal system was
a sham when it came to Palestinian rights.
Mr Rabin said he hoped the international community would take note of the
high court's reference to examples in US and British law where the right to
prior appeal was waived.

<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN government yesterday cut its forecast for 1992-93 growth in
gross domestic product (GDP) from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent, confirming
earlier indications that the economy is recovering more slowly than
expected.
The announcement coincided with the eighth successive quarterly reduction in
the inflation rate, which fell to a 30-year annualised low of 0.3 per cent
at the end of December, the lowest in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD).
However, Mr John Dawkins, the Labour treasurer (finance minister), said
unemployment was unlikely to fall substantially below 11 per cent before the
end of the financial year in June.
The government forecast in the August budget that unemployment would fall to
about 10 per cent by June, the latest possible date for the next federal
election. Unemployment has since risen to a record 11.3 per cent.
Mr Dawkins said the budget forecast of 2 per cent inflation for the current
year would be revised downwards by an unspecified amount.

MR John Major, British prime minister, yesterday sought to reassure the UK's
Gulf allies - the US and France - that attacks on Iraq were not intended to
break up that country.
Speaking in Oman, he said the allied governments were united in strategy
against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. 'I am quite confident of that,' Mr
Major said, in spite of some evidence of tension over recent attacks. Later,
Mr Major dined with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh.
The prime minister was conscious that Oman and Saudi Arabia are concerned
about Iran's greater strength as a regional power no longer checked by Iraq.
But, in his talks with Sultan Qaboos of Oman, he would have emphasised that
allied strikes enforced United Nations resolutions and international law.
Mr Major's discussions also covered the Bosnian situation. He played down
the chances of UK military intervention to protect Moslems there, saying
that helping humanitarian aid and searching for a political settlement were,
'for the time being, the way forward.'
He told a news conference that he supported calls for the 400 Palestinians
expelled by Israel 'to be returned from whence they came.'
President Saddam Hussein held talks with the Iraqi military for a fifth day
yesterday, the latest in a series of highly publicised meetings, Reuter
reports from Baghdad.
Mr Saddam has had seven meetings with military officers, many with the air
force. The reason, whether morale boosting or operational planning, was not
immediately clear. UN weapons inspectors, reported that their first
inspections of the Bill Clinton presidency were proceeding without incident.
Mr Maurizio Zifferero, chief nuclear inspector, on his return from
inspecting a site in northwestern Iraq said yesterday Baghdad was
co-operating thus far.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Cambodia's ambitious prince wins out: Sihanouk has bent the
UN's most expensive peacekeeping mission to his will
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FACT that yesterday's meeting of the Cambodian Supreme National Council
was held 3,000 miles away from Cambodia - in Beijing - was only the latest
indication of how the volatile Prince Norodom Sihanouk has bent the UN's
most expensive peacekeeping mission to his will.
Prince Sihanouk says he needs to stay in Beijing to be tended by his Chinese
doctors, and is thought to have suffered a minor stroke recently.
But this has not stopped the 70-year-old prince from cajoling and in some
cases strong-arming the five permanent members of the UN Security Council
into accepting his plan to have him elected Cambodian president. Cambodian
elections, threatened by continued violence and intimidation of voters, were
one of the main topics of discussions in Beijing yesterday between the four
Cambodian factions, the UN, and various governments.
The Cambodian peace accords signed in Paris in October 1991 provided for a
general election to be held in May this year under UN auspices, part of an
operation costing about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn). Yesterday's meeting
agreed that the election would take place between May 23 and 25.
The accords made no mention of a presidential poll, but Prince Sihanouk has
persuaded most of the signatories that his presidency will be vital for the
stability of Cambodia, particularly while the soon-to-be-elected national
assembly works to approve a constitution and form a government.
Another reason, frequently repeated by the prince in private, is his desire
to win a popular mandate for his leadership and blot out the ignominy of his
overthrow in a coup by Lon Nol in 1970.
France, Russia and China were content with the idea of Prince Sihanouk
becoming president before the general election. The US, Britain and the UN
were not. The prince forced them to agree: by retiring to Beijing and
sulking, by briefly carrying out a threat to cease co-operating with the UN,
and by refusing to sign agreements for much-needed loans from institutions
such as the World Bank (in his capacity as SNC chairman).
UN officials and western diplomats muttered 'blackmail', but yielded to the
prince, leaving only the timing of the presidential election unresolved.
The risks involved in alienating the ambitious prince - revered by peasants
as Cambodia's 'god-king' - were evidently too high. But diplomats involved
in the negotiations over Cambodia are painfully aware that there are dangers
in making him president.
First, they fear that his authoritarian tendencies, amply demonstrated in
the past, will come to the fore in an office whose powers cannot be defined
until there is a Cambodian constitution in August.
There is already worried talk of 'a new Sangkum', a reference to a movement
created by the prince in 1955 which defeated his long-established political
opponents with considerable help from a campaign of intimidation and
repression.
Second, there is concern that Prince Sihanouk's weaknesses will be
ruthlessly exploited by the Khmer Rouge, the extreme left-wing group blamed
for the deaths of 1m Cambodians between the overthrow of Lon Nol in 1975 and
the Vietnamese invasion of 1978.
The Khmer Rouge has repeatedly violated the Paris accords by breaking the
ceasefire and refusing to allow the UN access to its territory, although it
signed the agreements in 1991 and is one of the four factions represented on
the SNC. It has rejected the elections and is not among the 20 parties that
applied for registration before the Wednesday's deadline.
Yet, like almost any Cambodian leader, Prince Sihanouk will be so appalled
by the idea of a divided country after the elections (most of it under
government control and the rest in the hands of the Khmer Rouge) that he
might be tempted to invite the Khmer Rouge into some form of coalition to
reunify the country.
The Khmer Rouge would thus have achieved political legitimacy - while
ducking the blow to their credibility which would have come from doing badly
in an election - and retained control over their territory, their people,
their gems and their timber in the remote north-west.
As one academic who studies Cambodia put it recently, the problem is that
'Sihanouk thinks he can manipulate the Khmer Rouge, and the Khmer Rouge
think they can easily manipulate him.'
At present, most of the diplomatic energy directed at Cambodia is focused on
a dispute over the date of the presidential election. Typically, Prince
Sihanouk has made three consecutive and contradictory statements: first he
said it should be before the general elections; then he said it could be
simultaneous; and then he said it should be afterwards.
It is an open secret that what he actually wants is an early presidential
poll to allow him to take charge as soon as possible, but those who were
reluctant about the whole idea in the first place fear he would try to
declare a 'Cambodian solution' and cancel the general election if he were
made president too soon.

FT  29 JAN 93 / S Africa inflation at 15-year low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S inflation rate has dropped into single figures for the first
time in nearly 15 years, reviving hopes of a turnround in the economy,
writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg.
Figures released by the Central Statistical Service (CSS) show that the rate
of inflation, measured by the consumer price index, declined to 9.6 per cent
in December from 11 per cent in November. This is the lowest rate of
inflation since June 1978. The CPI declined by five percentage points in the
second half of 1992, having stood at 16.2 at the end of 1991.
Economists have long been predicting a further drop in interest rates, and
the most recent inflation figures have bolstered their case.
Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said yesterday that the bank
was re-examining its monetary policy - often a signal for a cut in rates.
The prime lending rate currently stands at 17.25 per cent.
Mr Dave Mohr, chief economist at the Old Mutual group, said the decline in
the inflation rate, which was sharper than predicted, was partly a function
of large increases in the CPI in the second half of 1991, and partly the
result of very small increases in the corresponding period in 1992. He cited
lower meat and vegetable prices, and falling mortgage rates as important
contributory factors.
Other factors include a fairly strong exchange rate, and firm monetary
policy with real interest rates now running at about 7.5 per cent.
Mr Mohr said inflation, which is a lagging indicator, reflected the weak
state of the economy for most of 1992.

<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN government yesterday cut its forecast for 1992-93 growth in
gross domestic product (GDP) from 3 per cent to 2.5 per cent, confirming
earlier indications that the economy is recovering more slowly than
expected.
The announcement coincided with the eighth successive quarterly reduction in
the inflation rate, which fell to a 30-year annualised low of 0.3 per cent
at the end of December, the lowest in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD).
However, Mr John Dawkins, the Labour treasurer (finance minister), said
unemployment was unlikely to fall substantially below 11 per cent before the
end of the financial year in June.
The government forecast in the August budget that unemployment would fall to
about 10 per cent by June, the latest possible date for the next federal
election. Unemployment has since risen to a record 11.3 per cent.
Mr Dawkins said the budget forecast of 2 per cent inflation for the current
year would be revised downwards by an unspecified amount, but the forecast
current account deficit would be revised upwards from 3.75 per cent to 4 per
cent of GDP, equivalent to about ADollars 16bn (Pounds 6.91bn).
He said the government had been forced to reduce its GDP forecast by
sluggish growth in other OECD countries, which affects demand for Australian
exports.
Mr John Hewson, the conservative opposition leader, said GDP growth was
unlikely to exceed 2 per cent.

</DATELINE>

THE INDIAN government's efforts to instil confidence in the economy,
following the recent inter-religious violence, yesterday received a boost
with the publication of an official forecast predicting a growth rate of 4.2
per cent for the year to June 1993, Stefan Wagstyl reports from New Delhi.
The figure suggests that the economy is set for a solid recovery after a
sharp slow-down in 1991-92, when gross national product (GNP) grew by just
1.4 per cent. However, the disruption caused by riots in Bombay and other
cities may have come too late to have been fully reflected in the forecast
prepared by the government's Central Statistical Organisation.
The main contribution to growth is the likely bumper performance of
agriculture, which has benefited from exceptionally good weather. Farm
output is expected to grow 4.2 per cent, according to the CSO. Construction
and services, including financial services, are also expanding rapidly.
However, manufacturing, which last year suffered a 2.3 per cent decline, is
recovering only slowly. The CSO expects growth in manufacturing of just 3.5
per cent.
This year's recovery is in line with the expectations of the government, and
of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund which are assisting
India's economic reform programme with loans. Last year's growth was held
back by a tight squeeze by the government designed to cut imports and curb
inflation. Now the authorities are slowly releasing their grip in the hope
of promoting sustained growth fuelled by exports and by the opportunities
created by deregulation.
But there is still a long way to go before most Indians share the benefits
of faster growth. With the population growing at 2 per cent a year, the CSO
estimates that per capita output will increase this year by just 2.2 per
cent.

THE FRENCH government, under growing electoral pressure, yesterday stepped
up its campaign to prevent what it sees as foreign countries' attempts to
entice investment away from France.
France is to ask the European Commission to investigate the UK aid given to
Hoover to persuade the US company to relocate a vacuum cleaner plant to
Scotland with the loss of 600 jobs in the Dijon region, Mr Pierre Beregovoy,
the prime minister, confirmed yesterday.
At the same time, he said that if Grundig, the German electronics company,
closed its television plant at Creutzwald in north-east France and
transferred production to Vienna, he would protest to the Austrian
government. Grundig, which was considering possible closure at its
headquarters in Fuerth yesterday, said the issue would be discussed again at
another board meeting on February 12.
Mr Beregevoy said that if Austria wanted to join the European Community 'it
must respect certain rules of the game'.
A spokeswoman for Mr Beregovoy accepted Brussels' denial that it had not
given Hoover any direct EC aid. But she said the Scottish Office assistance
to Hoover fell into the category of national aid 'which has to be authorised
by the Commission' and that France wanted to ensure such authorisation had
been duly given. 'It is not in the spirit of the Treaty of Rome to destroy
jobs in one country to create them in another,' she said.
Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, the agriculture minister who is also president of
the Burgundy region where Hoover's Dijon plant has been located, complained
that the US company had indulged in 'Apache tactics', scalping various
European governments for their investment aid.
Mr Richard Rankin, marketing director of Hoover Europe, denied this on
French radio and said his company sought a meeting with the French
authorities to explain their decision.
Within two months, France's ruling Socialists face a general election in
which a poll yesterday predicted they would win less than the Greens.
Unemployment has risen sharply, with new figures due out today expected to
top 3m.

PRESIDENT Fidel Ramos of the Philippines has made a strong appeal for more
foreign investment in his country, saying his government's openness to
investors is 'wholehearted and unequivocal'.
Mr Ramos, who is on a four-day state visit to Malaysia, said the Philippines
was determined to create a favourable climate for investors and was already
tackling some of the country's problems, such as power shortages and crime.
Urging Malaysian business to pay more attention to the Philippines, the
president said investment and two-way trade between the two countries was
still very small.
Malaysian investments represent less than 1 per cent of total foreign
investment in the Philippines. Malaysia's trade with the Philippines is also
under 1 per cent of its total trade.
Relations between the two countries have been aggravated by a Philippines
claim to the east Malaysian state of Sabah.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S engineering industry employers said yesterday they were ready to
back plans for substantial subsidies to loss-making east German enterprises,
provided engineering workers accepted a slowdown in their wage increases.
Details of the proposals were leaked yesterday by IG Metall, the engineering
workers' union, and promptly denounced by the employers, because the union
had rejected a revised wages agreement in east Germany.
The 'solidarity pact' for the engineering industry would, if agreed, be a
central element for the wider solidarity pact between the German government,
opposition, employers and unions, to finance the cost of east German
economic recovery.
A renegotiation of the engineers' existing wages deal in the east, which
grants a 26 per cent pay increase on April 1, and parity with western
workers by 1994, has been a central demand of the government and
industrialists for the planned solidarity pact.
This deal, the key to a series of wage equalisation contracts in the east,
is seen as the main reason eastern industry has been so uncompetitive, and
slowed down private investment in the region.
The joint paper worked out by negotiators for IG Metall, and Gesamtmetall,
the employers' organisation, calls for extended investment subsidies beyond
1996, special preferences for the products of east German manufacturing
industry, and a new deal to support exports by east German enterprises to
eastern Europe.
It proposes a long-term trade deal with states of the former Soviet Union,
including guaranteed exchange rates.
The programme would be financed by savings and re-ordered priorities in the
government budget.

INDIA and Russia yesterday resolved a 15-year-long debt dispute which has
marred relations between the two countries since the collapse of the former
Soviet Union.
President Boris Yeltsin and Mr PV Narasimha Rao, India's prime minister,
agreed that repayment of India's Rs380bn (Pounds 8.2bn) debt to the former
Soviet Union would be based on exchange rates which would reduce the total
amount, and that repayments would be stretched over about 45 years.
Mr Yeltsin, on a three-day visit to India, had cordial talks with Mr Rao as
part of a bid to improve relations which have suffered since the collapse of
Soviet communism, with Delhi turning towards the United States. He expressed
support for India on issues such as its dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir.
The Soviet Union had allowed India to make payments in rupees. But
depreciation of the rouble had made unrealistic Russia's demands for
repayment of debts built up in this way, Indian officials said.
'The rupee-rouble settlement will allow us to establish meaningful bilateral
relations, starting afresh,' an Indian official said.
Under the agreement, details of which were being worked out last night, 63
per cent of the debt will be repaid at the January 1, 1990 rate of Rs19.9
per rouble, and the remainder at the Rs31.57 rate of April 1, 1992.
The two countries have also signed 10 agreements on the second day of
President Yeltsin's visit, including a treaty of friendship and
co-operation, defence co-operation, trade, narcotics control, security, and
co-operation in the fields of science and technology, culture, and
information.
Mr Sharad Pawar, Indian defence minister and his Russian counterpart, Mr
Pavel Grachev, signed a comprehensive defence agreement to guarantee supply
of defence equipment, spares, product support and services needed for the
maintenance, repair and modernisation of frontline Russian armament deployed
by the Indian armed forces.
A defence ministry official said the defence agreement would boost India's
defence preparedness and relieve a crisis of spare parts of the Russian
defence equipment that India heavily relied upon, such as the MiG-29 fighter
aircraft, the upgraded T-72M tanks, mobile anti-aircraft missile systems,
warship missile spares and other ranges of Russian helicopters and giant
transport aircraft.
India and Russia also signed four trade agreements on the modalities of
counter-trade, debt repayment, utilisation of technical credit, and India's
repayment for machinery and equipment from the erstwhile Soviet Union.
Under the counter-trade agreement, persons from either country would be free
to import and export goods and services on the basis of any
internationally-recognised form of business co-operation.

LEADING industrial nations, fearing another Chernobyl-style nuclear
disaster, have finalised plans for a Dollars 700m (Pounds 452m) fund to
improve safety at east European reactors, officials said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Bonn.
Officials who took part in nearly six months of German-led talks by experts
from the Group of Seven leading industrial states said the group had finally
agreed on rules for the fund on Wednesday.
They said swift approval by G7 governments was expected for the fund, to be
administered by the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, which specialises in helping Europe's former communist states.
Other industrial countries were expected to join the G7 states - the US,
Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Britain and Italy - with contributions to
the so-called 'nuclear safety account'.
The fund will finance loans to east European governments for upgrading
operations and hardware in projects that cannot be covered by bilateral aid.
The safety improvements are meant for some of 32 Soviet-built reactors
deemed safe enough to be worth upgrading, but another 26 reactors, most of
them of the Chernobyl type, will be excluded.

FT  29 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Oman tank deal may be worth Pounds 150m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the British prime minister, yesterday confirmed that Oman had
agreed to buy Challenger 2 tanks from Vickers of the UK.
The purchase, expected to be worth about Pounds 150m including spares and
training, is the first export order for the new British tank in a fiercely
competitive world market.
It follows British contracts from Oman for Hawk jet aircraft and two
missile-carrying corvettes. Mr Major, on a stop-over on his return from
India, made the announcement in Muscat after talks with Sultan Qaboos bin
Said, Oman's ruler.
The initial contract will involve 18 tanks and four armoured repair and
recovery vehicles and is expected to be followed by another order for 20-30
tanks.
Vickers already provides support services for Oman's fleet of UK-made
Chieftain tanks.
Mr Major said the sale would sustain employment at Vickers' tank factories
in Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne, which each employ about 800 people.
Vickers is depending on export business to keep both production lines in
operation after the UK government's decision in 1991 to buy only 140 of the
new Challenger 2s.
The Omani deal follows a big setback to Vickers' export hopes last October,
when Kuwait opted to buy 236 M1A2 Abrams tanks, made by General Dynamics of
the US, in preference to the Challenger 2.
Thomson-CSF, the French defence electronics group, and Short Brothers, the
Belfast aerospace company owned by Bombardier of Canada, both refused
comment yesterday on speculation about an imminent link-up in the missile
business.
However, they said discussions were continuing on jointly developing a
successor to Shorts' Starstreak missile.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CROATIAN forces captured a strategic dam yesterday but said retreating Serb
troops had set off three demolition mines at key points, threatening the
structure with collapse.
Military and civilian government sources in the regional town of Sinj, 15km
south of the Peruca dam, said Croatian forces had won control of the dam
from rebel Serbs in the Krajina enclave.
In Sinj evacuation of more than 20,000 people in the valley below the dam
was being considered.
Experts were being rushed to the scene to examine cracks in the dam from
which water was spilling.
The heavily-mined dam provides electricity for its southern and central
Adriatic coastal cities.
Artillery and mortar duels between Croat and Serb forces erupted on
Wednesday night around the 65-metre high dam, which Serb rebels rigged with
explosives last year.
If the dam ruptures, more than 500m cubic metres of water in the
12-mile-long reservoir would endanger tens of thousands of people.
Tanjug, the Belgrade news agency said Croat long-range artillery fire had
hit the sluice gate adjacent to the dam. The dam lies at the far southern
end of the self-proclaimed Serb state of Krajina ten miles outside the UN
Protected Area.
UN officials say Krajina leaders in November 1991 warned that the dam had
been rigged as a guarantee that Croat forces would not seize it. Although
damaged in the 1991 Serbo-Croat war, the Peruca dam is a crucial source of
power for much of Dalmatia.
General Satish Nambiar, the commander of UN peacekeepers in the former
Yugoslavia, said: 'I am afraid it's a very grim situation.' He was critical
of the seven-day-old Croatian offensive into the disputed Serb enclave of
Krajina. 'I have to tell you quite frankly that this has been an immensely
rash and ill-advised action.
'It could have destructive consequences which we have not yet witnessed,' he
said.
The Croatian government claimed that Serb fighters had driven 50 Kenyan
peace-keepers from the Peruca dam, but that could not be confirmed.
Krajina's Serb commanders yesterday said they had halted the Croat military
offensive across UN lines, reported Tanjug. 'This creates conditions for a
counter-offensive,' said their statement, adding that Serb militia had
retaken several villages seized by Croat forces since Friday.
In Bosnia, meanwhile, Moslems and Serbs were again involved in artillery and
infantry attacks along the Drina River border with Serbia.

BOSNIA peace mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen may soon decide to ask

After six days of intensive negotiations in Geneva on the proposed map
dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, very little progress has

However, rebel Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, claimed significant progress
had been made and the warring sides could agree a peace package this
weekend.
It is clear the serious outbreak of fighting between Croats and Serbs in
Krajina, the Serb-occupied region of Croatia, has broken the momentum of the
conference on Bosnia and weakened the political will of all three warring
parties - Serbs, Moslems and Croats - to reach an agreement.
'One of the options before the (Security) Council would be whether it would
consider enforcing a peace proposal that Vance and Owen think is fair, even
if one or two of the parties had not signed on to it,' Mr Eckhard said.
It remains unclear what measures the Security Council would take to enforce
the peace plan, given the deep reluctance of most of its members to resort
to military intervention.
There was no firm indication yesterday whether the international mediators
had set themselves a deadline for reaching an agreement. The general
assumption appears to be that they are prepared to spin out this round of
negotiations at least until the weekend. But if no progress has been
registered by then, the decision to turn to the Security Council could come
very quickly.
In London, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, ruled out any
international military intervention in Bosnia.
He told parliament's foreign affairs committee: 'We don't believe it is
possible to impose a peaceful solution (in Bosnia) by means of a military
protectorate.'

THE Irish punt faced a further day of heavy selling in the foreign exchange
markets yesterday in spite of Wednesday's increase by the Irish Central Bank
of overnight lending rates to 100 per cent.
The punt remained pinned to its floor level against the Belgian franc in the
ERM through most of the day, and had to be sustained by intervention from
the Belgian central bank. Interbank rates for one month's money remained
around 35 to 40 per cent.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, yesterday said he supported
the Irish government's policy on the punt. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance
minister, reiterated his determination to defend the punt, saying: 'I want
to assure those in London that are spreading rumours of a devaluation that
they are wrong.' He added, however, that he is 'very concerned' by
sterling's weakness.
The government also lashed out at Mr John Bruton, the leader of the
opposition Fine Gael party, who earlier this week said the government should
devalue the currency. The government said his remarks were 'singularly
unhelpful' and had contributed to speculative pressure.
Mr Michael Noonan, the finance spokesman for Fine Gael, dismissed the attack
as 'government propaganda' and said the government will be forced to devalue
as 'it has no policy in place to cut the cost base of Irish business.'
Industry and farm leaders, alarmed by sterling's weakness and the high real
interest rates in the Irish market have demanded a comprehensive package of
tax reforms, and a renegotiation of pay deals with trade unions, if the
government is determined to continue defending the punt.
They say the temporary measures that the government has introduced are
inadequate.
A spokesman for the Irish Business and Employers Confederation said
yesterday: 'We are asking for strategic policies which will assure that the
cost base for business and industry is brought down to a level where
business can continue to compete.'

FT  29 JAN 93 / Flynn opts for a flexible approach: EC commissioner ready to
set new priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission's new social affairs commissioner, Mr Padraig Flynn,
comes across - rather deliberately - as the provincial Irish politician,
nursing his stronghold in County Mayo, and unversed in EC policy.
But it is possible the critics in Brussels and Dublin - who are comparing
him unfavourably with his Irish predecessor at the Commission, Mr Ray
MacSharry - may be repeating the mistake they made when Mr MacSharry took
over as agriculture commissioner in 1989.
Mr MacSharry was initially characterised as a 'rough diamond' without the
intellect of his predecessor, the urbane competition commissioner, Mr Peter
Sutherland. Yet Mr MacSharry was one of the undoubted successes of the last
Commission, in a politically treacherous and technically arcane area of EC
policy.
It has been widely assumed that Mr Flynn will be more attentive to his
prospects of succeeding Mr Albert Reynolds as Irish prime minister than to
the details of Community social policy.
Yet, after barely a month in Brussels, he is acquiring a reputation as a
canny operator. He engineered this month's declaration of support by EC
finance ministers for the Irish punt, still under speculative siege within
the ERM.
He also seems ready to set important new priorities in EC policy.
Talking to the Financial Times last week he suggested that the prescriptive
and detailed approach to the social dimension championed by his predecessor
as social affairs commissioner, Ms Vasso Papandreou, had run its course.
'We've reached a hiatus, a natural kind of hiatus, with the social action
programme,' he said.
That programme, enforcing minimum standards across the EC's workplaces, grew
out of Mr Jacques Delors' 1989 Social Charter - although Mr Delors himself
opposed turning it into such legislation.
Much of the programme has run up against a combination of recession and
opposition from member states, although some elements, such as the directive
which lays down strict controls on working time, may slip through the net.
Mr Flynn is now calling for 'a year of consolidation' and a more strategic
approach, with the Commission laying down a framework of minimum standards
'without getting involved in the details', which should be left to employers
and unions.
'The detail should be worked out when the legislation passes through
national legislatures, the flexibility must be there,' he says.
His officials promise a review of social dimension goals and methods by the
end of this year. They also say privately that the social dimension has been
hijacked since 1989 by the European trade unions and it is time to return to
the broader theme of a Citizens Europe.
'The Community has to be identified by ordinary people as having a
direction,' says Mr Flynn. He says that means highlighting the issue of
unemployment in the EC, which will reach 11 per cent this year: to which end
an 'Employment Week' conference is planned for October.
Mr Flynn says he also wants to make 'a big push' to allow EC citizens to
work and live in other EC countries. Legislation on free movement and mutual
recognition of qualifications is in place, but there are many practical and
bureaucratic obstacles to living and working in other EC countries -
currently only 2 per cent of EC citizens do so.
His officials say that there are a few areas where further legislation is
needed, such as on the mobility of occupational pensions, but what is really
needed is a commissioner who is prepared to do battle with those countries
that are not applying legislation.
Mr Flynn, who was justice minister in the Irish government, brings to social
affairs the two extra portfolios of immigration and justice: a combination
that means he should be in a good position to engage in just such a battle.
However, there is the danger that Mr Flynn will disappear into arguments
about drugs, asylum and terrorism, as internal borders within the EC are
dismantled. He will also be busy ensuring that Ireland continues to receive
its relatively favourable treatment from the EC social fund.
His officials are keen that he reforms the rather bureaucratic social fund
to make it more like the user-friendly regional fund, but Mr Flynn points
out that those countries, such as Ireland, which have made effective use of
the social fund have few complaints.
Many of Mr Flynn's aims will be welcomed by the British government, which
was barely on speaking terms with his predecessor. However the
'liberalisation' of the social dimension which Mr Flynn appears to stand for
may face resistance from his own government, which now includes the Irish
Labour Party, and from his own officials, who are more used to friendly
social democrats.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Outgoing EIB president issues warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ERNST-GUNTHER Broeder, outgoing president of the European Investment
Bank, yesterday issued a warning against those tempted to turn the bank into
a soft-loan organisation to promote growth inside the European Community.
Presenting annual results for 1992, which showed an 11 per cent increase in
EIB lending to Ecu17bn (Pounds 13.75bn), Mr Broeder, acknowledged political
pressure to use the bank to promote growth.
But he said the EIB's new lending criteria, agreed at the EC summit last
month, should not be at the expense of the bank's credit rating in the
capital markets.
"It is essential that the EIB remain a bank,' Mr Broeder said, 'rather than
an instrument to provide equity and capital.'
A German economist and bank executive, Mr Broeder is to retire in April
after almost nine years.
He is to be succeeded by Sir Brian Unwin, former chairman of Customs and
Excise in the UK.
The EIB has faced some criticism inside the European Commission for being
sleepy and too cautious in its assessment of risk.
But its ability to raise money - Ecus 13 bn in 1992 - in the capital markets
at attractive rates, gives it a key role in the EC growth package aimed to
enhance capital investment.
The EIB said yesterday that the first tranches of the special Ecu5bn lending
facility agreed in Edinburgh should be available for specific projects in
telecommunications, energy and transport by late-March or early-April.
The Ecu5bn would be spread over two years among the 12 EC member states.
The EIB will set up a European investment fund by the end of the year, with
a subscribed capital of Ecu2bn, to act as a catalyst for infrastructure
projects and to help small and medium-sized business.
The EIB is talking to 60-70 commercial banks about participation, though the
final number is likely to be smaller.
These banks will take 30 per cent of the capital. The EIB is to take 40 per
cent and the European Commission 40 per cent.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Effort to unblock EC hours directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADRAIG FLYNN, the new EC Commissioner for Social Affairs, is examining
ways to unblock the controversial draft directive setting a 48 hour maximum
working week.
He is also prepared to examine whether there is a case for amending the EC
directive which protects the pay and conditions of workers in company
mergers and which is currently causing uncertainty in the contracting-out of
public services in the UK.
The working time directive, a centrepiece of the EC Social Charter, has been
stuck in the legislative pipeline for nearly three years, mainly as a result
of UK opposition. But since an agreement in principle resolving most British
objections was brokered last June, the draft law has not moved forward.
'I would like to see this directive, and some of the others that have been
blocked, moving on under the Danish presidency,' Mr Flynn said yesterday.
Denmark, currently in the EC chair, has made social policy a priority.
According to senior European Commission officials, Mr Flynn has been
considering whether to redraft the directive. But following a meeting of
social affairs ministers in Copenhagen yesterday, he said he would await the
report of the working group set up last June to resolve outstanding
'technical' differences between France and Germany.
The British EC presidency of the second half of last year showed little
enthusiasm to resolve such differences. The UK would be most affected by the
directive, having to provide legal protection for workers unwilling to work
more than 48 hours.
The UK government, which is threatening to take legal action against the
directive even in its diluted form, argues that the measure would
reintroduce rigidities into the labour market and add to costs in industry.
However the fact that Mr Flynn appears to be leaving open the possibility of
an amendment to the 1977 Acquired Rights Directive, which has cast a shadow
over contracting-out in the UK, will please the UK government.
That directive was intended to offer workers protection in company mergers
but recent legal judgments seem to extend the protection to a broad range of
public service workers whose functions are contracted out to the private
sector.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Milan magistrates widen their net
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAGISTRATES investigating the Milan municipal corruption scandal have
widened their investigations to include the controversial reorganisation of
the chemicals industry in 1990.
Under investigation are ENI, the state oil concern, the Ferruzzi Group's
Montedison, and Anas, the state road building authority.
The Milan scandal, which this week saw the 100th person arrested on
corruption charges, has shaken the Italian political establishment. So far
the political casualties have mainly been politicians with a base in
northern Italy. This includes Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, whose
home base is Milan. Parliament is considering whether to waive his
parliamentary immunity over allegations of corruption and illegal party
financing.
A picture has emerged of a well-organised and systematic process whereby the
main political parties, headed by the Christian Democrats and Socialists,
demanded 5-7 per cent on public works contracts.
However, the investigation is now focusing on the activities of the parties
in Rome, where the same process is believed to have been practised on a
bigger scale. The spotlight on road building contracts has followed the
interrogation on Tuesday of Mr Alberto Mario Zamorani, a former deputy
managing director of Italstat, the civil engineering subsidiary of IRI, the
state holding company.
Equally explosive is an investigation into the sale by Montedison to ENI of
its stake of their jointly run chemicals group, Enimont. The oil and
petrochemicals industry had long been considered a fiefdom of the Socialist
party. In the past few days police have searched both Montedison and ENI
offices. They also sought files from the office of Mr Giuseppe Garofano, the
former chief executive of Montedison.
Milan magistrates are also investigating power station contracts. But this
so far has been limited to Sardinia.
Rome magistrates are investigating the purchase by the treasury of a number
of buildings in Rome. Following arrests on Wednesday of four senior or
retired civil servants, including a former director-general of the treasury,
44 people have now been charged with corruption in this investigation.
Milan magistrates have been persuading the Swiss authorities to co-operate
more closely over access to suspect bank accounts.
As the magistrates' net draws closer to party headquarters in Rome, Mr Craxi
has suggested that parliament form a commission to examine party financing.
The Christian Democrats have given informal backing; but Mr Craxi's enemies
see the move as a smokescreen.

FT  29 JAN 93 / IG Metall offers new deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S engineering industry employers said yesterday they were ready to
back plans for substantial subsidies to loss-making east German enterprises,
provided engineering workers accepted a slowdown in their pay rises.
Details of the deal were leaked yesterday by IG Metall, the engineering
workers' union, and promptly denounced by the employers, because of the lack
of a new wages agreement.
The employers said that a secret document, spelling out the rescue programme
for eastern industry, was 'not authorised.' It had been agreed by
negotiators 'only with the express precondition that there would be a
revision of the wage contracts' in east Germany. That was still rejected by
the union, the most powerful in Germany.
The 'solidarity pact' for the engineering industry would, if it can still be
agreed, provide a key element for the wider solidarity pact between the
German government, opposition, employers and unions, to finance the cost of
east German economic recovery.
A renegotiation of the engineers' existing wages deal in the east, which
would grant a 26 per cent pay increase on April 1, and parity with western
workers by 1994, has been a key demand of both the German government and
industrialists for the planned solidarity pact. The engineering pay deal is
seen as the key to a series of wage equalisation contracts in the east,
which have made eastern industry uncompetitive, and slowed down private
investment in the region.
The joint paper worked out by negotiators for IG Metall, and Gesamtmetall,
the employers' organisation, calls for extended investment subsidies beyond
1996, special preferences for the products of east German manufacturing
industry, and a new deal to support exports by east German enterprises to
eastern Europe.
It proposes a long-term trade deal with states of the former Soviet Union,
including guaranteed exchange rates against the rapidly-devaluing rouble, to
encourage purchases.
The whole programme would be financed by savings and re-ordered priorities
in the government budget.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Asda launches Pounds 347m rights issue to accelerate
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA, the grocery retailer, has launched a Pounds 347m rights issue only 15
months after it raised Pounds 357m through a similar exercise.
The move, along with Wessex Water's Pounds 113m rights issue on Tuesday, is
expected to mark the beginning of a series of deals to raise equity capital.
Companies are keen to take advantage of a relatively buoyant stock market
and to raise money from the City before the government's demand for funds to
finance the budget deficit becomes too onerous.
Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, said yesterday that the group had
planned to make a rights issue towards the end of this year but decided to
come earlier.
He said he warned Morgan Grenfell, Asda's merchant bank, before Christmas
that the company might launch an issue early in 1993.
Less than three weeks ago he asked the bank and Asda's brokers for a date as
soon as possible. Mr Norman said yesterday: 'There are a lot of rights
issues in the pipeline. When I met Morgan Grenfell I told them: 'I want to
be first''.
He said the group had no immediate need for the money but wanted to
accelerate a recovery programme begun in May.
The issue marks a further step in the transformation of Asda, which 18
months ago seemed to be in severe, and some thought irreversible, decline.
The board has since been almost completely changed, with Mr Norman arriving
in December 1991. The group's shares rose on the news, closing up 3 3/4 p at
67 3/4 p, indicating investor support for the issue.
The previous rights issue was priced at 35p but the shares fell after that,
reaching a low of 23p in August last year.
Asda also made a profit forecast for the current year, to May 1, of Pounds
130m pre-tax and before an exceptional credit of Pounds 8.7m and the
interest receivable on the rights issue money, estimated at Pounds 3.5m.
This would be a rise from Pounds 86.8m in 1991-92, before exceptional
write-offs of Pounds 451.6m.
Asda said sales in the current year in comparable stores were running 2 per
cent ahead of the last financial year, an increase greater than it had
expected. In the first half of the year sales growth was 1 per cent, and the
improvement since then surprised brokers who follow the group.
A final dividend of 1.1p is forecast, which would give a total of 1.6p, down
from 2.1p the previous year and 4.8p in 1990-91.
The profit forecast exceeded brokers' earlier estimates, but some then
increased their forecasts to Pounds 135m or Pounds 140m. Estimates for the
following year range between Pounds 180m and Pounds 190m.

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK wins Pounds 4bn defence deal: Saudi contract secures
19,000 jobs in one of largest export orders won by Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA is to buy 48 Tornado aircraft as part of an arms package worth
Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn agreed last night by Mr John Major and King Fahd, the
ruler of the Gulf state.
The deal is believed to be one of the largest export orders won by the UK
and will secure 19,000 jobs at British Aerospace and its subcontractors. It
will be welcome news to BAe which has been forced to lay off thousands of
workers because of cuts in defence spending.
The Saudi deal represents a significant success for Mr Major, who has faced
fierce criticism over mounting unemployment. Earlier, he confirmed that Oman
had agreed to buy Challenger 2 tanks from Vickers of the UK in a deal that
could be worth Pounds 150m. That deal should safeguard some 1,600 jobs at
Vickers' factories in Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
The package, announced after lengthy talks in Riyadh, covers a significant
military infrastructure programme in addition to the Tornado bombers, which
are worth about Pounds 2bn with weapons and spares.
Other items are understood to include ground defence radars as well as the
construction of hardened shelters for the air-craft.
However, an expected sale of up to 60 more BAe Hawk light jets has yet to
materialise. Confirmation of orders for three further mine-hunting vessels
for the Saudi navy from Vosper Thornycroft, the shipbuilding and engineering
group, also remains uncertain.
Mr Dick Evans, BAe chief executive, said last night he was delighted with
the conclusion of the deal, adding that it owed a lot to the support of Mr
Major.
The Saudi deal represents the first real progress on the second phase of the
Al Yamamah defence co-operation agreement for more than four years. The
project, negotiated in 1985 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher was prime minister,
currently sustains about 33,000 jobs in the UK, largely in the north-west.
The project covers the sale of aircraft, warships and other defence
infrastructure, as well as training and refurbishment.
Britain is estimated to have already supplied Pounds 10bn of defence-related
equipment as part of the project. Under the first phase, BAe supplied 72
Tornados and 30 Hawk trainer jets. The second phase had been postponed by
difficulties over financing and by the Gulf war.
Yesterday's deal came at the end of Mr Major's overseas tour, which also
included India and Oman. He has won praise from UK industrialists who
accompanied him for taking an active role in boosting overseas sales.
Saudi Arabia was only added to Mr Major's itinerary this week, suggesting
the prime minister knew a deal was imminent.
Britain has been anxious to conclude a deal on the second phase of Al
Yamamah, mainly because of the large number of jobs involved.
The Tornado sale will help fill a gap at BAe's main military aircraft plant
at Warton, Lancashire, before the start of production of the four-nation
Eurofighter 2000 around 1996. Work on previous orders for the
Anglo-German-Italian Tornado has virtually ended.
Other major UK beneficiaries of the deal will include GEC-Marconi and
Rolls-Royce.
The Challenger 2 purchase by Oman is the first export order for the new
British tank in a fiercely competitive world market. It follows British
contracts from Oman for Hawk jet aircraft and two missile-carrying
corvettes.
The initial contract will involve 18 tanks and four armoured repair and
recovery vehicles and is expected to be followed by another order for 20-30
tanks. The Omani deal follows a big setback to Vickers' export hopes last
October, when Kuwait opted to buy 236 M1A2 Abrams tanks, made by General
Dynamics of the US, in preference to the Challenger 2.
In the past few days, the prime minister has been able to announce that a
Pounds 140m contract for an electricity inter-connector in India had been
won by a UK company. He also announced a joint venture between British Gas
and the Gas Authority of India.

MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday took a rare step for a serving prime minister by
issuing writs for libel against two magazines.
The move, announced by Mr Major's press secretary, came after reports on
allegations about his private life - which Downing Street said were untrue -
appeared in the current issue of New Statesman &amp; Society, a leftwing
magazine, and in the January issue of Scallywag, a London satirical monthly.
The statement said: 'The prime minister has today instructed solicitors
Biddle and Company to issue writs for libel against the New Statesman &amp;
Society and against Scallywag.' Biddle and Co said last night it had issued
a writ seeking damages and an injunction for libel against the distributors
of the New Statesman.
Ms Clare Latimer, the woman named in the articles, has also issued writs for
libel against the two magazines and the distributors. WH Smith and John
Menzies announced that they were taking the New Statesman off the shelves.
Ms Latimer runs a catering company called Clare's Kitchen, which has
occasionally been employed for Downing Street functions.
At a press conference in Oman, Mr Major refused to comment on his reasons
for taking action, referring only to the statement. 'I have nothing further
to add to that,' he said. But the decision to make a formal denial and then
issue writs via the press secretary, Mr Gus O'Donnell, underlined the
seriousness with which the prime minister apparently viewed the threat to
his reputation and credibility.
Only three serving prime ministers this century have sued for libel, the
most recent being Mr Harold (now Lord) Wilson, in 1968.
At Westminster, MPs of all parties were quick to condemn the magazines, but
the effect on possible changes to press regulation is delicately balanced.
The articles may strengthen calls at Westminster for a new privacy law as
recommended in the Calcutt report. But the prime minister's personal
involvement in a libel case may make it harder for the government to be seen
as an impartial arbiter of press standards.
Mr Steve Platt, editor of the New Statesman and co-author of the article,
said yesterday that he did not regret publishing and was confident of
successfully defending any legal action. He said the magazine was putting
its trust 'in the jury's ability to see the difference between a smear and
honest effort to expose it'.
The decision to act was taken by Mr Major early yesterday as he flew into
Oman from India. He had been told about the article the night after hosting
a dinner for UK and Indian businessmen in Bombay, after which he consulted
his lawyers.
The statement was then issued after early morning consultations with Downing
Street officials in London.
Downing Street said Mr Major is to pay for the legal actions himself. It
said there was no comparison with the case where the legal bill for the
eviction of an unwelcome tenant from the private home of Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, was shared between the taxpayer and anonymous Tory donors.
Mr Major went on to meet Sultan Qaboos of Oman at his fortified royal camp
in the desert about 60 miles from Muscat. Apparently good-humoured, when a
photographer said the press were not using telephoto lenses, Mr Major joked:
'And I hope there is no bugging'.
It emerged that contingency plans had been in place should reports of the
allegations become widespread. Downing Street's denial was issued in London
before Mr Major had heard about the article in Bombay.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Trade deficit deepens after record imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD IMPORTS in December pushed Britain's trade deficit to its highest
monthly level for 2 1/2 years and inflated the annual current account
deficit for 1992 to almost twice that of the previous year.
The last full set of trade figures for six months showed the UK's visible
trade gap widening to Pounds 1.74bn in December as the value of exports fell
and the value of imports rose to their highest ever level, boosted by the
lower pound. The figures compared with a Pounds 1.41bn shortfall in
November.
The monthly deficit on the current account - which includes a Pounds 200m
surplus on invisible items, such as financial services, government transfers
and dividends - was Pounds 1.54bn, the biggest since June 1990.
In spite of the poor figures, the government could draw comfort from the
fact that the growth in export volumes outpaced import volumes in the fourth
quarter.
The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. But analysts said
the sharp rise in imports reflected more than the effect of sterling's
devaluation, prompting concern that the UK does not have the manufacturing
capacity to close the trade gap when the economy recovers.
The figures provided some evidence of recovery with strong growth in imports
of consumer durables and manufactured components. The message was reinforced
by news that the narrow measure of the money supply - notes and coins in
circulation - is likely to breach the upper limit of its Treasury target
range this month. M0 is considered by the Treasury to be a reliable guide to
underlying inflationary pressures. According to estimates based on Bank of
England figures published yesterday, it has risen by a seasonally adjusted
4.2 per cent this month compared with January 1992.  The upper limit of the
Treasury range is 4 per cent.
The December figures from the Central Statistical Office rounded off a
dismal year for the UK's trade position. In spite of recession - normally
expected to depress imports - the current account deficit last year was
almost double the previous year's shortfall.
In 1992 it ballooned to Pounds 11.8bn, with imports at a record annual high
of Pounds 120.4bn. This compares with a current account deficit of Pounds
6.32bn in 1991. The deficit on visible trade was Pounds 13.77bn compared
with Pounds 10.3bn in 1991.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, said: 'The country is still in
deep recession and deep trouble.'

RECORD IMPORTS in December pushed Britain's trade deficit to its highest

6.32bn in 1991. The deficit on visible trade was Pounds 13.77bn compared
with Pounds 10.3bn in 1991.
At Westminster, the figures prompted opposition attacks on the government's
handling of the economy. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour's deputy leader, said
'the country is still in deep recession and deep trouble'.
Mr Tony Newton, standing in for the prime minister, Mr John Major, at
question time, accused Labour and the Liberal Democrats of talking down the
economy when the conditions for recovery were in place.
The UK and other European countries now face a gap in the publication of
intra-EC trade figures as a new system for measuring trade data, in line
with the single market, is introduced.
Although export volumes are expected to pick up this year as UK goods
benefit from the devaluation of the pound, most economists expect the trade
deficit to deteriorate slowly over the year. The exact position will not be
known until June when the CSO publishes the new set of figures.
Export volumes, excluding oil and erratic items, slipped by 1.7 per cent
month-on-month in December while imports rose by 1.3 per cent. In the fourth
quarter, export volumes rose by 4 per cent compared with imports which rose
just 0.5 per cent.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Touching nerves on a learning curve: Jurek Martin assesses
the first week of Bill Clinton's presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE FIRST week of his presidency Mr Bill Clinton has shown himself more
than capable of touching a few raw national nerves in the US. His
appointment of his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to head the task force on
health-care reform, and his determination to end the military's
discrimination against homosexuals, may be socially and politically
controversial - for sure, they are not the acts of a shrinking violet.
Both decisions may be seen as deliberate counterbalances to the impressions
of uncertainty left by the last week of his transition into office - when,
as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York observed, 'the clatter of
broken campaign promises' could be heard all over Washington - and to Mr
Clinton's tactical retreat when his nomination of Ms Zoe Baird to be
attorney-general ran into trouble.
But these decisions may also reflect, as did his inaugural address, a
conscious determination not to neglect what he promised to do in the
campaign: in sum, to avoid the mistakes four years ago of President George
Bush who took over and did very little until his invasion of Panama.
The elevation of Mrs Clinton, a lawyer, should come as no surprise. Her role
in the election campaign was played down for political reasons, after a few
early and not entirely tactful remarks about baking cookies, but neither the
president's reliance on her advice nor her intellectual and professional
credentials have been in serious dispute.
Still, she presents a new target for those on the right who rail against
'feminazis,' as Mr Rush Limbaugh, the virulent talk show host, likes to call
independent professional women. The reintroduction of her maiden name, which
disappeared after her husband had lost his first bid for re-election as
governor of Arkansas, has excited some adverse comment from the
hyper-critical.
Recognition of her influence also creates an element of uncertainty in a
Washington unaccustomed, since Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1930s and 1940s, to
dealing with a First Lady on substantive policy-making. Disputes with women
cabinet secretaries may be fair game, but the rules of engagement with Mrs
Clinton, answerable in the first instance only to her husband, are not so
clear.
However, Mr Clinton has made clear that he considers ending the ban on
homosexuals in the military to be a matter of principle. He frequently cites
comparable resistance more than 40 years ago to the full racial integration
of the US military, forced on an unwilling top brass by President Truman.
The new president's campaign commitment to end the exclusion was
unequivocal.
To him it is conduct that matters, not a person's sexual orientation. Some
of his aides point out that, while the military record on race may now be
exemplary by US standards, it has also condoned some gross misconduct - as
shown by the notorious Tailhook revelations of appalling sexual harassment
of women.
In the last analysis the military high command will do, as it always has,
what it is told by its civilian commander-in-chief. But it is not above
trying to throw a few blocks in his path, not least by exploiting its
connections in Congress.
Opponents there of keeping gays out of the armed forces maintain their
presence would be detrimental to conduct, morale, privacy and efficiency,
though the evidence adduced is often thin, and that the president would be
exceeding his authority by unilaterally ending it. Above all, they argue
that the president should heed the advice of his senior officers, who have
forged such a fine fighting force.
There is also a deep national ambivalence about gay rights, extending far
beyond the religious, homophobic right. There are constant battles about
whether school textbooks should acknowledge homosexuality as an accepted way
of life. Last year several states, most controversially Colorado, passed
laws appearing to encourage, or at least not to discourage, discrimination
against gays.
Mr Clinton, therefore, has stepped into a political and social minefield,
convinced he has right on his side. He is respected for this, but not
necessarily for the wisdom displayed in taking it on so early in his
presidency, thus putting at risk a large stock of his initial political
capital, already a little depleted by the Baird withdrawal.
Put crudely, the argument is that, when it comes time to cut the military
budget, he will be in need of the support of the likes of Senator Sam Nunn,
Democratic chairman of the Senate armed services committee and an opponent
of ending the ban on homosexuals. There is already tension between Mr
Clinton and Mr Nunn.
There is also the threat of mischief in Congress, for example, by tagging on
to the family leave bill an extension of the homosexual ban, thus forcing
the president to veto a measure high on his agenda. Representative Tom Foley
and Senator George Mitchell, Democratic leaders of the House and the Senate,
would rather not have to finesse this one, and do not want Congress to lapse
back into 'gridlock' even before the president's domestic policy agenda is
on the table.
Late yesterday Mr Clinton indicated his inclination towards a phased,
consultative approach, saying he favoured delaying an end to the ban on
homosexuals for six months to give him more time to study the issue.
He can take some consolation in the knowledge that, either way, he was going
to be damned and that to leave his wife under wraps and gays out of the
military might not have been the softer options. The learning curve is
steep.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Divided Republicans to pick new leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPUBLICAN leaders in the US have gathered in St Louis to elect a new party
chairman for the task of leading them back to the White House after last
year's defeat of President George Bush.
The task is formidable. The Republicans have not yet worked out how to
recapture voters with a diversity of views on social issues, such as
abortion, and bring them back into the coalition that worked well for
President Reagan.
Ideology is expected to provide a strong undercurrent at the St Louis
meeting. Many of the 165 Republican national committee members who will
today elect the chairman are worried about the widespread perception that
their party has been taken over by fundamentalist Christian right-wingers.
According to soundings taken by the White House Bulletin, a Washington
newsletter, 80 per cent of committee members believe their party should
scrap or revise its traditional platform promise to work for a
constitutional amendment banning abortion.
But most of the chairmanship candidates have steered clear of the
ideological debate, and have emphasised the 'nuts and bolts' job of
strengthening the party's grassroots organisation.
The two leading contenders are Mr Haley Barbour, a Mississippi party
official who served in the Reagan White House but may have spent too long as
a Washington lobbyist for the committee's taste, and Mr Spencer Abraham, a
former Michigan party chairman who may be too closely identified with former
Vice-President Dan Quayle, a potential candidate for the 1996 presidential
nomination.
Mr John Ashcroft, who has just stepped down after eight years as governor of
Missouri, may have the political stature but some Republicans are wary of
his ties to the religious right. Mr Bo Callaway of Colorado and Mr Craig
Berkman are viewed as outsiders.
This is the first chairmanship contest for the Republicans since 1977. When
the party holds the White House, the president can select his own chairman,
as President Bill Clinton did for the Democrats last week in picking Mr
David Wilhelm as chairman.
The Republicans may be in better political shape than their loss of the
White House would suggest, having more governors and Congress members than
when they lost the presidential elections of 1960 and 1976.
But, with Mr Ross Perot lurking in the wings as an alternative, the new
chairman will have a struggle to ensure his party casts a wide net for
voters.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEGISLATION to modernise the Brazilian port system was passed by Congress on
Wednesday night after two years of negotiation, writes Christina Lamb in Rio
de Janeiro.
Port workers began a national strike yesterday in protest against the
legislation, which requires approval by President Itamar Franco.
The new law is the first step towards privatisation of the system, which the
Brazilian Exporters' Association claims to be the most expensive and
inefficient in the world.
Although the legislation reduces the power of the stevedores' union, it does
not go as far as business would like. Port users will still have to contract
labour from the union, but the number of workers for each job, hours and
wages will be set by a new port authority.
Workers' representatives will comprise a third of the port authority and
business the remainder.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Brazilians on the road with a long tale to tell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRAZILIAN government sent on its way this week a roadshow meant to
explain, to creditors across three continents, the agreement in principle
reached last July to restructure Dollars 44bn (Pounds 28.9bn) of Brazil's
foreign bank debt.
Such roadshows have become a convention over the decade since the onset of
Latin America's debt crisis. But never before, at this stage of a large debt
restructuring, has its final outcome been so much in doubt.
The tour - headed by Mr Pedro Malan, the chief debt negotiator - began on
Wednesday in New York before at least 200 bankers. The first presentation
lasted more than four hours and was criticised by some bankers as being
unnecessarily long and rather ramshackle.
Presentation, however, may be the least of Mr Malan's problems. The
Brazilian accord is the only such agreement to have reached this stage
without the borrowing country having in place a current International
Monetary Fund programme.
Also, it comes during a transition for economic policy under President
Itamar Franco's new government.
Mr Paulo Haddad, economy minister, is to fly to Washington on February 6 to
open negotiations with the IMF on a new accord, the last having lapsed after
the first instalment because of Brazil's failure to meet targets. A
technical mission of the fund is expected in Braslia next week.
The government is hoping for a sympathetic hearing on the basis of the
country's demonstration of institutional strength throughout the bringing to
book last year of Mr Fernando Collor, then Brazil's president, who was
accused of corruption.
However, some bankers believe that the fund may have reached its limit of
tolerance towards Brazil. In the absence of clear economic policy direction
from the new government, legislation to increase taxes, now before Congress,
may not be enough to obtain a new accord.
It is unclear how Brazil, with no IMF accord in place, intends to pay the
Dollars 3.2bn collateral to guarantee some of the bonds to be issued under
the accord, at least half of which is supposed to be provided by
multilateral agencies and the rest from reserves.
European bankers had no success in attempts to convince the Brazilians to
delay the debt tour at least until after the IMF negotiations.
Some US banks keen to see the deal go ahead have been pushing Brazil to use
its reserves, which are at historic levels - Dollars 19bn in cash at the end
of last year - and thus move ahead without the IMF. One said: 'If Brazil
wants to meet its foreign commitments, it will do so whether or not an IMF
deal is in place. Brazilian letters of intent with the IMF are little more
than junk mail anyway.'
However, to put up all the money from reserves would be politically
difficult for the Brazilian government and unlikely to obtain the necessary
Senate approval.
The most likely course is that many banks will indicate their choice of
options - although the February 22 deadline seems unlikely to be met -
hoping that Brazil will make progress with the IMF and its own fiscal
situation. One European banker said: 'If, by February 22, they don't have an
IMF deal, I don't think that would stop me from recommending that we tender
our debt.'
Bankers supporting the deal emphasise the new government has followed to the
letter the agreement reached under the Collor government.
The lack of an IMF accord is not the only difficulty, however. The six
options open to creditors make it one of the most complex 'Brady' debt
reduction deals to have emerged. Even with an IMF accord, Dollars 3.2bn is
unlikely to be sufficient to provide the necessary guarantees for the new
bonds immediately. So the remaining guarantees will have to be phased in
over two years, or bonds issued in place of the guarantees.
Furthermore, as in the Argentine agreement completed last year, some banks
will not get the choice they want. Brazilian officials have indicated they
want 'balance' in the deal. This is code for saying they do not want all the
banks to choose the most attractive option which, at current low US interest
rates, is the 'par' bond.
These bonds would be the most expensive for Brazil and are likely to use the
most collateral.
The Brazilians have informally indicated they would like the final choice to
be split - 40 per cent for 'par' bonds, 40 per cent for 'discount' bonds,
and 20 per cent for the other options, including new loans. Some banks -
including Citibank, the largest lender - are said to be considering new
loans. Without the right balance, though, the deal may be jeopardised.
It is no surprise, then, that even the deal's most optimistic supporters
admit to considerable doubts that it can be closed before its final deadline
of July 31.

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Nortel chief goes in 'orderly
transition'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DR PAUL Stern is stepping down as chief executive officer of Northern
Telecom, just two days after the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker
unveiled unexpectedly strong 1992 earnings.
The company stressed yesterday that the initiative came from Dr Stern and
did not fit the pattern set by the string of executives who have been forced
from the top jobs of troubled North American companies. A spokesman said
that the move marked 'an orderly transition of a financially-strong
company'.
With a background in the telecommunications and computer industries, Dr
Stern's name is bound to surface as a potential candidate to replace Mr John
Akers as chief executive of IBM. Mr Akers announced earlier this week that
he would be stepping down once the computer giant has chosen a successor.
Prior to joining Nortel, Dr Stern held a senior position at Unisys, the US
computer group.
Despite Nortel's strong financial performance, signs of tensions in the
executive suite surfaced last year when Mr Jean Monty, head of its sister
company, Bell Canada, was named president and chief operating officer. The
move has been widely interpreted as an effort by BCE, the Montreal-based
conglomerate which owns 53 per cent of Nortel, to rein in Dr Stern.
Mr Monty will take over as Nortel's chief executive on March 1. Dr Stern
will remain as non-executive chairman. He will also become a visiting
professor at the Wharton business school and pursue other unspecified
interests.
Known for his strong-willed and opinionated management style, Dr Stern, aged
54, spearheaded a strategy to expand Nortel's business outside North
America.
Northern reported 1992 earnings of USDollars 536m, up from Dollars 497m in
1991.

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Coca-Cola gains 9.5% to Dollars
392.6m in fourth quarter

<TEXT>
COCA-COLA, the Atlanta-based soft drinks company, yesterday reported a 9.5
per cent advance in fourth-quarter profits after tax, to Dollars 392.6m, on
sales 12.7 per cent higher at Dollars 3.24bn. With accounting-related
charges stripped out, the rise would have been 11.8 to Dollars 400.6m.
The group's full-year figures are muddied by the effects of the change in
accounting methods for non-pension retirement benefits. Before these items,
net profits showed a 17.8 per cent improvement, at Dollars 1.91bn. After the
accounting-related charge, the advance is reduced to 2.9 per cent, leaving
net profits at Dollars 1.66bn. Sales for the full year were 13 per cent
higher at Dollars 13.1bn.
Coca-Cola said that the fourth-quarter volume growth helped the final
quarter's figures. 'It augers well for 1993 that we ended 1992 with such
momentum,' commented Mr Roberto Goizueta, chairman.
Coca-Cola said that operating profits from its soft drinks operations within
the US advanced 9 per cent last year. Unit case volume sold to retail
bottle/can and fountain customers grew 2 per cent, and gallon shipments of
concentrates and syrups advanced by a similar amount.
On the international side, soft drink operating profit was up by 18 per
cent. Unit case volume sold to retail customers increased by 4 per cent, and
gallon shipments of concentrates and syrups grew by 3 per cent.

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Wang recovers to a modest
Dollars 400,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WANG Laboratories, the US computer systems company struggling to emerge from
bankruptcy protection, yesterday reported a small net profit for its second
fiscal quarter.
The net profit of Dollars 400,000 included a Dollars 19.4m gain from foreign
exchange adjustments, balancing a currency exchange loss of Dollars 19.5m in
the first quarter. Second-quarter losses last time were Dollars 6.8m.
The operating loss for the quarter was Dollars 6m, which compares with an
operating profit of Dollars 7.8m last year. Revenues for the quarter were
Dollars 351.2m, down from Dollars 500.7m last time.
The second-quarter results reflect the impact of cost reductions and
restructuring efforts, Wang said. Profit margins were, however, reduced by
worldwide pricing pressures and a continuing shift in customer demand
towards lower-priced products, it added.
For the half-year, it reported a net loss of Dollars 66.2m, or 39 cents,
compared with a net loss of Dollars 16.6m, or 10 cents. Six-month revenues
totalled Dollars 711.2m, against Dollars 961.8m.
'The company continues to expect a successful and timely emergence from its
Chapter 11 (bankruptcy) proceedings,'it said.
Wang recently announced that it would eventually eliminate manufacturing
operations.

strong growth in sales

AT&amp;T, the US communications and computer group, yesterday reported a 15 per
cent increase in underlying net income for 1992, helped by strong
fourth-quarter growth in product sales and financial services.
The company reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 1bn, or 75 cents a
share, on revenues of Dollars 17.5bn, compared with net income of Dollars
635m, or 48 cents, in the same period of last year, on revenues of Dollars
16.46bn.
However, earnings in the 1991 quarter were cut by 14 cents a share because
of a reduction in the book value of an Italian investment, against a 3
cents-a-share cut in the latest quarter.
The figures were in line with Wall Street expectations, which were pitched
around earnings of 78 cents a share.
For 1992, net income totalled Dollars 3.81bn, or Dollars 2.86 a share, on
revenues of Dollars 64.9bn. That compared with 1991 earnings of Dollars
522m, or 40 cents. However, excluding charges and one-time gains, the
underlying 1991 figures were Dollars 3.24bn, or Dollars 2.51, on revenues of
Dollars 63.09bn.
AT&amp;T's largest business, telecommunications services, saw long-distance call
volumes rise some 5 per cent in the quarter, but revenues were down to
Dollars 9.72bn from Dollars 9.79bn. The company said this was due mainly to
business customers choosing lower-priced, higher-capacity dedicated lines,
as well as adjustments to revenue estimates for previous periods.
On Wednesday, MCI, the second-largest long-distance carrier in the US,
reported a 14 per cent increase in fourth-quarter traffic and a 13 per cent
revenue increase.
AT&amp;T's products businesses saw a 20 per cent rise in fourth-quarter
revenues, from Dollars 4.4bn to Dollars 5.3bn, led by network switching
equipment. Consumer products reported record quarterly sales.
NCR, the computer company AT&amp;T acquired in 1991, produced operating income
of Dollars 94m, up from Dollars 76m, on sales of Dollars 2.15bn, up from
Dollars 2bn. The latest figures included results from Teradata, which AT&amp;T
acquired early in 1992.
The company said NCR continued to report strong orders in the US and Latin
America, but other parts of the world remained weak.
Financial services revenues rose from Dollars 420m a year ago to Dollars
577m, thanks to the group's Universal credit card and AT&amp;T Capital Corp.

UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, yesterday reported an after-tax
loss of Dollars 223.9m in the fourth quarter of 1992.
This large deficit in the final three months takes UAL's loss for the year
to Dollars 370m, before including charges for accounting-related changes.
The fourth-quarter figure, on operating revenues of Dollars 3.2bn, against
Dollars 2.91bn, comes after pre-tax charges and expenses of Dollars 62m.
Excluding these items, UAL said the loss would have stood at Dollars 184m.
The full-year loss widened to Dollars 956.8m after taking in charges related
to the change in the accounting methods for non-pension retirement benefits.
In 1991, the after-tax deficit was Dollars 331.9m. Full-year revenues stood
at Dollars 12.9bn in 1992, compared with Dollars 11.7bn in the previous 12
months.
In terms of operating results, UAL saw minimal improvement in final-quarter
results - with the operating loss standing at Dollars 326m, compared with
Dollars 347.2m in the same period of 1991.
For the year overall, the operating loss widened from Dollars 494.1m to
Dollars 537.8m.
UAL's poor fourth-quarter figures were echoed at Delta Air Lines.
Delta posted a net loss of Dollars 126.3m in the the second quarter of its
financial year, with a Dollars 187.6m deficit in the same period of 1991.
Revenues were Dollars 2.87bn, compared with Dollars 2.62bn.
The operating loss for the period was Dollars 194.9m, against Dollars 236.8m
in the same period of 1991.
In the first six months of its current financial year, Delta now shows an
after-tax loss of Dollars 233m, compared with a Dollars 174.5m deficit at
the same stage a year ago. Six-month revenues stand at Dollars 5.94bn,
against Dollars 5.2bn.
Continental Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier, also reported losses for
1992 overall and for the fourth quarter.
The annual deficit after tax was Dollars 125.3m, compared with a Dollars
305.7m loss in 1991, with the operating loss reduced from Dollars 218.9m to
Dollars 107.6m. However, in the fourth quarter, Continental's net loss was
Dollars 14.4m, compared with a tiny Dollars 4.4m profit in 1991, and the
operating loss was virtually unchanged at Dollars 43.7m against Dollars
44.2m.

BANK of Boston, a leading New England bank, yesterday reported
fourth-quarter net profits of Dollars 73.6m, or 75 cents a share, down from
Dollars 93.5m, or Dollars 1.15, a year ago.
The bank stressed, however, that the level of its bad debt provisions had
declined last year, in the fourth quarter to Dollars 10m from Dollars 78m a
year before. The net profit level would have been just Dollars 56.6m in the
quarter had it not been for a tax credit.
For the whole of 1992, Bank of Boston's net income was Dollars 263.1m, or
Dollars 2.84 a share, a substantial recovery when compared with a loss of
Dollars 26.6m, or 53 cents, in 1991.
The 1992 result was helped by Dollars 71m of tax credits carried forward
from prior years.
On Wall Street, the bank's share price closed Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars
26 1/8 .

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL CITIES/ABC, the US television and newspapers group, yesterday turned
in a fourth-quarter 1992 net profit of Dollars 137.9m, or Dollars 8.38 a
share, an improvement of 34 per cent year-on-year.
The results, which included a moderate rise in revenues at the ABC
Television network, were struck on total revenues of Dollars 1.64bn, some 5
per cent better than in the same quarter of 1991.
For the year to end-December 1992, Capital Cities/ABC earned Dollars 389.3m
before taking special charges for changes in accounting standards, up from
Dollars 374.7m before charges in 1991. After an accountancy-related
provision of Dollars 143.2m, the group's net income for 1992 fell to Dollars
246.1m, against a net of Dollars 343.5m the previous year.
Operating income for the year was Dollars 721.8m, down from Dollars 761m in
1991.
Revenues for 1992 were Dollars 5.34bn, down slightly from Dollars 5.38bn in
1991. Net revenues for ABC Television were slightly lower, primarily because
of the absence of 1991 added revenues from special-event sports programming.
Although the group does not state operating profits for ABC Television, it
is understood these came to just below Dollars 100m for 1992, against an
estimated Dollars 135m the previous year.
The decline is believed to be related to a series of internally recorded
special charges caused by buy-outs being offered to some executives and
other cost-cutting measures.
On Wall Street, the Capital Cities/ABC share price closed Dollars 2 3/4
higher at Dollars 481.

LOTUS Development, the US personal computer software company, reported
improved fourth-quarter earnings despite a slight drop in sales.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 14.6m, or 35 cents a share, up from
Dollars 5.8m, or 14 cents, a year ago when the company took a Dollars 24.4m
restructuring charge. Revenues declined 1 per cent to Dollars 246m from
Dollars 249.2m.
A pre-tax gain of Dollars 15m from the sale of stock in Sybase, another
software company, was offset by a Dollars 15m pre-tax restructuring charge
for costs associated primarily with the closure of the company's Puerto
Rican manufacturing subsidiary.
For the year, Lotus reported net income of Dollars 80.4m, or Dollars 1.87 a
share, up from Dollars 43.1m, or 98 cents, in 1991. Revenues increased 9 per
cent to Dollars 900.1m from Dollars 828.9m. Sales of Sybase stock produced a
pre-tax gain of Dollars 49.7m for the year. Excluding extraordinary items in
both years, net income declined by 7 per cent to Dollars 57.2m.

<TEXT>
DOW CHEMICAL, the second-biggest US chemicals group, yesterday reported a
loss of Dollars 250m, or 92 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1992,
compared with a loss of Dollars 94m in the corresponding period of 1991.
The deficit, which was expected, occurred because of a Dollars 433m charge
for plant shutdowns and staff reductions.
Mr Frank Popoff, chairman, described the company's results as
'disappointing', although he stressed that progress had been made in
restoring US margins.
The US improvement, however, was more than offset by deteriorating business
conditions in Europe, a problem faced by several big US chemicals groups.
Revenues in the fourth quarter of last year were Dollars 4.72bn, up slightly
from Dollars 4.56bn last time.
Revenues for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 18.97bn, against Dollars 18.81bn
in 1991.
Dow said its operating income declined by 23 per cent in 1992 to Dollars
1.3bn, mainly because of a drop in prices.
For the year to end-December 1992, Dow suffered a net loss of Dollars 496m,
or Dollars 1.83, against a net profit of Dollars 935m in 1991.
The loss, however, was due to a Dollars 765m non-cash charge related to
changes in accountancy standards.
The chemicals and performance products division had Dollars 279m of
operating income in 1992, unchanged on 1991, including the impact of special
charges. Plastics saw an 80 per cent decline in 1992 operating income, but
the figure was not disclosed. The energy business suffered a Dollars 179m
loss in 1992, compared with a loss of Dollars 230m in 1991.
The consumer specialties business had 13 per cent better operating income of
Dollars 1.1bn, representing 84 per cent of the entire group's 1992 operating
profit.
Dow's share price was Dollars  3/4 lower to close at Dollars 52 5/8 .

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
R. R. DONNELLEY, the world's largest commercial printer, announced that it
would take a Dollars 60m restructuring charge in the first quarter as a
result of the decision by retailer Sears, Roebuck decision to discontinue
its catalogue operations.
The Chicago-based printer had produced the Sears 'Big Book' for 80 years. It
said the charge would be taken primarily to cover the costs of shutting down
the Chicago printing plant that had produced the catalogue. The company said
660 full-time jobs would be cut.
Donnelley also reported record earnings for 1992 and the fourth quarter.

DOW JONES, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, posted a 6 per cent rise in
underlying fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 37.8m from Dollars 35.5m.
Earnings were distorted by charges of Dollars 8m in the quarter which
brought reported net income to Dollars 29.8m, or 30 cents a share. A year
earlier, net income stood at Dollars 3.5m, or 3 cents, including one-time
charges of Dollars 32m.
Revenues rose 4 per cent to Dollars 476.1m from Dollars 456.1m.
For the whole of 1992, Dow Jones recorded net earnings of Dollars 107.6m, or
Dollars 1.06 a share, compared with Dollars 72.2m, or 71 cents, in 1991.
Revenues advanced 5.4 per cent to Dollars 1.82bn from Dollars 1.73bn.
Results included charges of Dollars 18.8m in 1992 for the adoption of new
accounting standards and write-downs. The company had charges of Dollars 32m
in 1991.
Dow Jones had forecast 1992 earnings between Dollars 1.03 and Dollars 1.07 a
share after charges of Dollars 25m.
Gannett, US publisher of 82 daily newspapers including USA Today, turned in
fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 114.2m, or 79 cents, on revenues of
Dollars 935.1m. This compares with earnings of Dollars 97m, or 68 cents, on
revenues of Dollars 901.2m a year earlier.
For the full year, Gannett had net income of Dollars 199.7m, or Dollars
1.39, including charges of Dollars 146m for the adoption of new accounting
standards.
In 1991, Gannett earned Dollars 301.6m, or Dollars 2. Revenues rose to
Dollars 3.47bn in 1992 from Dollars 3.38bn.

McDONALD'S Corporation, the world's largest hamburger chain, reported record
earnings for both the year and fourth quarter, and modest gains in sales,
particularly overseas.
For the quarter, net income was Dollars 227.9m, or 61 cents a share, up 14
per cent from Dollars 200.4m, or 54 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 10 per
cent to Dollars 5.7bn from Dollars 5.2bn a year ago. Revenues, which due to
franchising agreements are below sales, were Dollars 1.8bn, up 6 per cent
from Dollars 1.6bn a year ago.
For the year, McDonald's earned Dollars 958.6m, or Dollars 2.60 per share,
up 12 per cent from Dollars 859.6m, or Dollars 2.35 cents, a year ago. Sales
for the period were Dollars 21.9bn, compared with Dollars 19.9bn, and
revenues were Dollars 7.1bn, up 7 per cent from Dollars 6.7bn.
US sales grew 6 per cent in the year and 9 per cent in the quarter, while
overseas sales gains were stronger. Overseas sales were up 17 per cent for
the year and 13 per cent for the quarter.
At December 31, 39 per cent of McDonald's sales, 44 per cent of its
operating income, and 32 per cent of its restaurants came from outside the
US.
McDonald's said improvements in the US were largely due to cuts in operating
and development costs, and its value pricing programme. Overseas, expansion
and improved operating margins bolstered profits.

<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the Cincinnati-based consumer products company, yesterday
reported after-tax profits of Dollars 590m in the three months to
end-December, up from Dollars 523m in the same of period of 1991. Sales rose
by 4.4 per cent to Dollars 7.84bn.
P&amp;G suggested that gains had been made on both the international and
domestic sides of the business. 'Improved margins, unit volume growth and a
lower effective tax rate were the major factors contributing to the growth
in earnings,' it said.
For the first six months of the financial year, after-tax profits stood at
Dollars 1.02bn, compared with Dollars 1.06bn in the same period of 1991, on
sales of Dollars 15.7bn, against Dollars 14.7bn.
The 1992-3 figure, however, was struck after taking a Dollars 200m reserve
related to the September disposal of P&amp;G's fruit juice business.
Warner-Lambert, the US healthcare group, has formed a research based
alliance with Jouveinal, a French pharmaceutical company, giving Warner
Lambert a 34 per cent interest, Reuter reports.
Warner will have first refusal to Jouveinal's developed compounds outside of
France, its oversees departments and territories, French speaking Africa and
Canada.

NATIONAL Bank of Canada is buying Gentrust, the trust company and money
management operations of General Trustco, a Quebec financial services group,

acquisition or by setting up new subsidiaries. NBC is the sixth-largest
chartered bank with CDollars 40bn assets.
NBC also plans to sell its leasing business with nearly CDollars 1bn assets,
to GE Capital, North America's biggest leasing group, and will show a

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Chrysler triples earnings to

<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US motor manufacturer, yesterday underscored the gradual
recovery in the North American vehicle market and its own sharply-improved
performance by announcing fourth-quarter net earnings more than tripled from
1991.
Chrysler, the smallest and most financially vulnerable of Detroit's big
three manufacturers, had net earnings of Dollars 356m, or Dollars 1.12 a
share, compared with Dollars 97m, or 33 cents, in the same period of last
year. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 10.2bn, up from Dollars 8.2bn.
The figures were slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations, which had been
pitched around Dollars 1.05 a share. Chrysler had forecast profits of more
than Dollars 300m as part of the regulatory filings for its current offering
of 40m shares.
The company's shares to closed up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 39 7/8 in New
York, which would allow its share issue to raise Dollars 1.59bn gross.
Chrysler is the first of the Detroit companies to report fourth-quarter
figures. Ford Motor has already signalled it expects a loss - largely due to
problems in Europe - which analysts think may total between Dollars 250m and
Dollars 450m.
General Motors, which is undergoing a drastic restructuring of its
lossmaking North American operations, could produce figures ranging from a
small profit to losses of Dollars 300m before special charges.
Chrysler, whose long-term survival was questioned two years ago, reported
1992 earn ings of Dollars 723m, or Dollars 2.21 a share, compared with a
loss of Dollars 795m, or Dollars 3.28, in 1991. Revenues rose from Dollars
29.4bn to Dollars 36.9bn. Its share of the North American car and truck
market rose from 12.4 per cent in 1991 to 13.4 per cent, helped by the
launch of new vehicles.
Mr Robert Eaton, chairman, and Mr Robert Lutz, president, said volumes and
margins were up for the year and discounts to sell vehicles were lower.
However, they said the company had to continue to improve its product
launches, cost reduction efforts and quality and productivity gains.
'The economic recovery in the US continues to be slow and neither our
balance sheet nor our credit rating are where we want them to be,' they
added.

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAP GEMINI Sogeti (CGS), Europe's leading computer services group, yesterday
provided further evidence of the recession in the computer industry by
publishing its first annual loss.
The French group made a net loss of FFr80m (Dollars 14.8m) last year,
against a FFr560m net profit in 1991, on turnover up 19 per cent over the
same period, to FFr12bn.
The sales rise was due to the first-time inclusions of two acquisitions,
Volmac and Programmator, the Dutch and Swedish computer services groups,
rather than growth in the market. Pre-tax profits fell to FFr45m from
FFr584m, after a FFr338m restructuring charge for between 1,000 and 1,500
job losses.
Earnings suffered from the twin pressures of the economic downturn and the
growing trend for computer manufacturers to diversify into services such as
advice on installation, CGS's core business, said Mr Geoff Unwin, one of the
group's three presidents.
Many computer makers had tried to buy market share by cutting fees, but Mr
Unwin predicted that they would not be able to hold rates at unprofitable
levels indefinitely.
CGS had been able to hold its rates in systems integration, where quality
was still at a premium, said Mr Unwin. However, demand was weaker for of
computer training, one of the first costs that businesses have sought to
trim during the downturn.
Another factor in the loss was the upheaval in CGS's scattered subsidiaries,
where the group is encouraging units in different countries to work together
more often on transnational projects, a service in increasing demand among
its larger customers.
This has meant replacing the former territorial split of responsibilities
with an organisation based on a mixture of sector and geographical lines.
CGS expects the first fruits of the reorganisation to show this year.

<TEXT>
ADIA, the Swiss-based international employment services group, will have to
dig deeply into shareholders' capital to finance an estimated 1992 loss of
SFr203m (Dollars 139m) and intends to raise new capital through a rights
issue, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. The group made sharply-reduced
profits of SFr25m in 1991 on a turnover of SFr3.2bn.
The company will propose a capital increase 'of at least SFr250m' through a
rights issue. Most of this will come from the conversion into equity of a
SFr200m loan made to Adia last year by its majority shareholders, Mr Klaus
Jacobs, the Swiss industrialist, and Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus, the German
retailing group.

MR PIERRE Suard, chairman of Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications
and engineering group, yesterday estimated that last year's net profit rose
by between 12 per cent and 15 per cent, but that earnings would probably be
flat this year, writes William Dawkins in Paris.
This indicates that profits rose to at least FFr7bn (Dollars 1.29bn) in 1992
from FFr6.2bn in 1991. It also appears to back up recent warnings from
analysts that profit margins in the telecommunications equipment market,
from which Alcatel Alsthom derives more than half its profits, could shrink
in the next few years.

IRI, the Italian state holding company, yesterday dismissed the board of
Iritecna, its lossmaking civil engineering subsidiary and Europe's
second-largest general contracting group, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The new board is to be headed by Mr Franco Bonelli, a commercial law expert
and former visiting professor at Stanford. The chief executive will be Mr
Roberto Gianini, an MIT-educated engineer MIT with extensive experience in
both the state and private sectors.
Last week, IRI took similar action with Ilva, its troubled steel group. This
latest move underlines the determination of Mr Michele Tedeschi, IRI's chief
executive, to take radical steps to reduce mounting losses against the
background of the government's privatisation plans.
The board shake-up has also highlighted the problems faced by IRI when, a
year ago, Iritecna become the vehicle for merging IRI's civil engineering,
construction and industrial plant enterprises, held by Italstat and
Italimpianti. Final 1992 figures have yet to be announced, but losses are
understood to be around L1,500bn (Dollars 1.01bn) on turnover of L6,000bn.

<TEXT>
ROBERT BOSCH, Germany's leading vehicle components maker, suffered a
'substantial' fall in profits last year, and faces another difficult period
in the current financial year, the company said yesterday.
Earnings figures, which are expected to be published in June, will therefore
show their third consecutive decline. Net profits dropped 10 per cent in
1990 and fell a further 3.5 per cent to DM540m (Dollars 339.6m) last year.
Group sales, up just 2.2 per cent to DM34.4bn, compared with DM33.6bn in
1991, had been hit by the effective revaluation of the D-Mark against other
currencies during the second half. Adjusted to take account of this factor,
turnover rose by 4 per cent.
Rationalisations, including cuts in material and capital costs, and the
reduction of the workforce by 11,000 to 170,000 worldwide had helped improve
productivity, the group added.

DAF, the troubled Dutch truckmaker, has secured promises from its creditors
that they will seek to arrange short-term financial banking for the company,
but has yet to reach full and final agreement on long-term restructuring.
Mr Cor Baan, Daf's chairman, said a 'minority of the parties' involved in
the search for ways to secure the company's future needed more time to study
certain 'facets' of Daf's proposed restructuring plan.
He said the additional investigations would be completed as soon as
possible, but could not say when the Daf rescue plan would be unveiled.
Twice this week Daf has called a press conference to announce the plan, only
to say that the talks had yet to yield a final result.
Mr Baan declined to name the parties or give details of the plan, other than
to say that it would involve a 'package of projects' and would represent a
'very thorough-going restructuring'.
Some of Daf's banks are thought to want a closer analysis of the
restructuring plan before committing more long-term funds. Separately, the
economic affairs ministry said in The Hague that the analysis requested by
the banks could take weeks.
Unions are braced for heavy job losses in the Netherlands and also in
Belgium and the UK, where the truckmaker has large industrial operations.
The company has posted losses for the past three years

FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Fiat confirms sharp profits drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, Italy's biggest private-sector company, yesterday confirmed its
profits had fallen sharply in 1992 and described the year ahead as remaining
'critical'.
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, said in a letter to shareholders that the
group's industrial activities, which account for more than 80 per cent of
its sales, had remained in profit at the operating level. However, margins
are believed to have fallen to about 0.2 per cent of sales against 1.1 per
cent in 1991.
The group's key car business, hit by rising competition and recession, is
believed to have made a loss, although no official figures are available. In
a summary of the group's problems, Mr Agnelli refered to a cocktail of
recession, monetary turmoil, high interest rates and Italy's domestic
economic problems.
Group pre-tax profits are likely to fall to around L800bn (Dollars 542m)
against L1,690bn in 1991. The figure has been boosted by substantial
extraordinary earnings, the biggest of which is a L700bn contribution from
the sale of Fiat's 25 per cent stake in Alcatel Italia, the telecoms group
formed largely from its former Telettra subsidiary. Official profits figures
 -and news of the dividend - will not be released until May.
The group's continuing commitment to investment and research and development
 -which reached a record 14 per cent of sales last year - has had a heavy
impact. Fiat's net financial position worsened to a deficit of L3,800bn at
the end of last year, compared with a L270bn deficit at the end of 1991 and
L2,510bn at end-June 1992.
Group turnover increased 4.6 per cent to L59,100bn thanks to the first
full-year's contribution from the Ford New Holland tractors and heavy trucks
business. On the cars side, sales fell to L26,886bn from L27,506bn,
reflecting the 114,700 drop in unit sales and the reduction of margins.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE adoption of new accounting requirements and paying Pounds 103,000
to a former director, Thomas French &amp; Sons has seen its pre-tax profit fall
from a restated Pounds 285,000 to Pounds 110,000 in the year ended October 3
1992.
The group also announced the sale of Kaz Krafts, which incurred losses of

A maintained final dividend of 2.175p is proposed for an unchanged total of
3.625p.

<TEXT>
J SAVILLE Gordon Group, the Birmingham-based property investment and
merchanting concern, reported a slight decline in six month pre-tax profits,
but maintained the dividend, in its first results since it wound up its
securities and commodities trading division. writes Paul Cheeseright.
Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 were Pounds 1.26m (Pounds
1.35m). Earnings per share amounted to 0.85p against 0.9p and the interim
dividend is held for the third year running at 0.5p.
Group turnover was sharply lower at Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 28.5m). With rent
reviews coming through, property income is set to increase, leaving the
pipeline business as the weaker part of the group. Operating profits in the
first half were Pounds 545,000 against Pounds 636,000.
Mr John Saville, the chairman, observed a recent improvement in demand,
however, which should show through more strongly in figures for the next
financial year.

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Strike doubles loss at GM Firth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRIKE at its steel rolling mill, Spartan Redheugh, was principally blamed
by GM Firth (Holdings) for a doubling of its pre-tax loss, from Pounds
712,000 to Pounds 1.5m, in the half year to September 30.
The knock-on effect on its steel stockholding subsidiary, one of the mill's
principal customers, together with high interest charges and 'what was
probably the worst market for steel since the 1930s', all contributed to the
loss.
Mr Michael Wilkinson, the chairman, said that accordingly the group's
principal aim in recent months had been to resolve the strike and
significantly reduce borrowings.
Although Spartan's ability to expand was restricted by a shortage of working
capital, that position would be eased when the new bank facilities were in
place, he said. Borrowings had fallen from Pounds 14.6m on April 1 1992 to
about Pounds 6.6m at present.
Turnover dropped to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 23.4m). Losses per share were 4.46p
(1.85p) and again there is no dividend.
Last week it was disclosed that Mr Roger Shute, president of BM, the
industrial holding company, had bought a 4.4 per cent stake in Firth.

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: LBC saved but Crown goes into receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of LBC, the London talk radio station, has been secured for the
rest of its franchise period, but its parent, Crown Communications, has gone
into receivership with debts of Pounds 16m.
LBC has floated clear of the wreckage and effective control has passed to
Chelverton Investments, whose main shareholders are Mr Matthew Cartisser and
Mr John Porter. Mr Porter is the son of Dame Shirley Porter, the
controversial Conservative politician and Sir Leslie Porter, the former
president of Tesco.
The deal, which will take care of about 80 per cent of the Crown debt,
values LBC at Pounds 14m, and a total of Pounds 7m new capital will be
injected.
Chelverton, which will invest a total of Pounds 2.5m - Pounds 500,000 now
and Pounds 2m if LBC regains its franchise - will have 49 per cent of the
equity with an option to go to 51 per cent.
Much of the remaining equity is held by Crown's bankers, ANZ and the Bank of
Scotland, in exchange for debt.
'For the first time we can offer LBC security for the future. We will keep
LBC on the air and successfully regain its franchise,' Mr Porter said after
months of negotiations finally ended in a deal.
The London commercial speech franchise is expected to be advertised within
the next couple of months by the Radio Authority. The current franchise runs
out at the end of 1994.
Neither LBC nor Independent Radio Sales, another Crown subsidiary, are in
receivership.
The end of the road for Crown was triggered by the decision of the CSA, the
French broadcasting authority, to block the sale of its French radio
station, RFM, in a deal that would have been worth some Pounds 3m.
In the absence of a sale to a consortium that included another French radio
group, NRJ, Crown's banks decided they could no longer support the group.
Administrators from Arthur Andersen were called in at 10pm on Wednesday. The
joint administrators, Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr Martin Fishman, said they
would be meeting with all parties as soon as possible.
Mr David Haynes, the Crown chief executive, said last night that the company
was taking legal advice both on the decision made by the CSA and about
statements made by the French broadcasting authority.
The CSA had claimed Crown built up its stake in RFM to 70 per cent, contrary
to French law.
'We have been sellers for a whole year, and to say we have been trying to
build our stake flies in the face of all reality,' said Mr Haynes, who
insisted last night that Crown had never had more than 49 per cent of the
voting shares of the French station.
The Crown chief emphasised that the CSA had been kept fully informed of the
shareholding position throughout.
Mr Murdoch McKillop, the joint receiver, will go to Paris on Monday to see
what can be salvaged from the RFM station, which is still on the air.
It is thought unlikely that Crown will survive as an entity and that instead
the remaining businesses, such as IRS and Business Information, which
produces corporate videos, will be sold.
Mr Christopher Chataway, the Crown chairman who is also chairman of the
Civil Aviation Authority, is expected to remain chairman of LBC for the
immediate future and Mr Charlie Cox will remain station manager.
Mr David Haynes, chief executive, said last night he would be staying with
LBC. He added that on the question of the CSA decision and statements made
by the French regulatory authority, it had been fully informed at every
stage about RFM's ownership.
Less than three years ago Crown was trading at 250p. When the share price
was suspended last year pending the LBC deal it stood at 8p.

3.96m in the year to end-June, against Pounds 21.3m. Net exceptional
costsfell from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 2.43m.
As there has been no improvement in market conditions the company is seeking
a financial reconstruction with a share placing and open offer and at
present is relying on the support of its bankers. The auditors say that the
accounts have been prepared on a 'going concern' basis.
The company said that a request to the Stock Exchange to have the shares
re-listed, in view of the progress in cutting losses, was turned down.
Losses per share were 23.8p (84.4p).

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Running fast but still fourth / Asda's
continuing programme for recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET'S reaction to Asda's rights issue yesterday, pushing the shares
up 3 3/4 p to 67 3/4 p, shows how far the food retailer has come in a short
time.
When the previous chairman and chief executive, Mr John Hardman, left the
company in the summer of 1991, many thought that the only hope for the group
was a takeover. And few could think who the saviour might be given the depth
of the problems.
Yet now stockbrokers are pushing up profit forecasts and looking for the
shares to rise yet further.
To be fair, the shares are still below the level they stood at when Mr
Hardman left. So the new management team, headed by Mr Patrick Gillam and Mr
Archie Norman, has more to do.
However shareholders who took up the last rights in October 1991 - a
9-for-10 issue at 35p - or who bought the shares when they touched 23p last
August, are feeling pleased with themselves.
Unlike the last issue, which came close to flopping, yesterday's 3-for-10
offer at 53p a share seems likely to be taken up enthusiastically.
The two issues, plus asset sales, will have cut group debt from more than
Pounds 900m when Mr Hardman left to about Pounds 100m net. Borrowings
currently stand at Pounds 448.5m.
That answers one of Asda's problems, the need to rebuild the balance sheet.
It was severely strained in 1989 when Asda bought 60 Gateway stores from
Isosceles, the group which took Gateway over in a leveraged deal, for Pounds
705m. According to Mr Norman the final cost of that acquisition, which he
said should never have been made, will approach Pounds 1bn after adding the
costs of integration and refurbishment.
The next problem is how to use balance sheet strength to address the trading
problems. At first, Mr Norman admitted, the cash would be gathering interest
awaiting future spending.
'We can finance (capital spending) this year and next from trading,' he said
yesterday, 'but in three years time the business would be getting smaller.'
He added that the time from buying a site to opening a store is two or three
years, so the group must now look to financing spending in 1995.
Asda has a legacy of 'first generation' superstores in its north of England
heartland. Many were converted from warehouses, factories or mills. They do
not stand up well to competition from new stores opened by rivals.
It must revamp, resite or rebuild these stores in order to protect the large
market shares it has in its traditionally strong areas. Mr Norman added that
at the same time it must win back its reputation for offering value for
money to ordinary working people and their families.
The launch of an 'Asda Price' campaign last autumn, and work on improving
ranges is already bearing fruit, he claimed. Trading is ahead of
expectations with like-for-like sales growth accelerating.
Asda did better than the industry average over Christmas, he said, and when
J Sainsbury launched its January sale Asda prices were still significantly
lower.
Now he is beginning to attack the property issue. The revamp of a store at
Wolstanton, Stoke, in September last year, has more than paid for the Pounds
2m cost with a 20 per cent increase in sales.
This store, said the company, would 'provide the basis for a store format
which could be applied to the renewal of the core Asda superstore chain'.
Mr Norman admitted that a few months trading from one revamped store was
'early days for hard evidence', but he believed there was enough to carry on
with the programme, and in any case 'the alternative is to wait until it's
too late'.
As well as revamping stores, Asda plans to resite about 15 of the oldest
ones at a cost of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 20m each, and rebuild five
to 10 stores on existing sites, costing about Pounds 9m each and involving
closing the stores for about eight months.
Asda is also experimenting with a discount store format called Dales. With
four open so far, all conversions of 'burnt-out' Asda stores, sales have
risen sufficiently to offset the lower margin they achieve.
Mr Norman said there was still more experimentation to be done, and agreed
that the formula of a discount store on an edge-of-town site had never been
tried in the UK before. He took encouragement from successes of similar
stores in the US.
Between the Wolstanton Asda and the four Dales shops, he said Asda had 'the
basis for commercially viable formats which, as they are further enhanced,
will be rolled out'.
At the moment, shareholders seem happy to go along with Mr Norman's view.
Profit forecasts stretch up from between Pounds 135m and Pounds 140m pre-tax
for the current year, to Pounds 180m or Pounds 190m next and perhaps Pounds
240m or more the year after. That progression would suggest the shares have
further to rise.
But there is also a note of caution to be sounded. Holding fourth place in
an industry with three highly competitive leaders, the task of transforming
the business cannot be as simple as Mr Norman's confidence might make it
seem.
'He might be right,' concluded one analyst, 'but it's high risk'.

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: AB Consulting Pounds 0.85m in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AB Consulting, the engin-eering consultancy, blamed the recession in the
construction industry for a fall into pre-tax losses of Pounds 849,000 in
the six months to October 31. There were profits of Pounds 327,000 last
time.
The company, however, said that it expected to be back in profit in the last
quarter of the current year following cuts in staff and overheads last
October and November.
Turnover improved to Pounds 6.29m (Pounds 5.36m) helped by the acquisition
of Brian Ford Partnership.
Losses per share came out at 5.4p (earnings 2.7p). The interim dividend has
been cut from 2.2p to 0.3p.

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Watson pays Pounds 21m for Circle K stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATSON &amp; Philip, the Dundee-based wholesale and retail food group, is buying
Ensign Holdings, the holding company for Circle K, a privately-owned
convenience store business, for Pounds 21m.
The shares jumped 30p to 333p on announcement of the deal which entrenches
W&amp;P's position in the lucrative convenience store market.
The group will issue 4.4m shares to Circle K and pay Pounds 7.66m in cash.
Mr Ian Macpherson, chairman, said the acquisition was 'an exciting extension
of W&amp;P's business into the growing convenience store market'. Mr David
Liddle, managing director of Circle K, was not available for comment.
Mr Macpherson said that, since acquiring Amalgamated Foods for Pounds 35.5m
in April 1991, W&amp;P had been looking for ways of achieving sustainable
growth. Market research it commissioned showed that the convenience store
sector was an area of real growth potential.
The group had been expanding its network of stores only in 'ones and twos',
but the Circle K deal had increased its stores from 100 to 300 in England
and Scotland.
W&amp;P's core business was wholesale delivery of food to shops it did not own.
It would benefit from economies of scale and access, for the first time, to
franchising and forecourt stores, increasingly common at petrol stations.
Mr Macpherson noted recent research showed discount food retailers had
doubled yearly sales to Pounds 10bn in the past decade, while sales of goods
at petrol forecourt shops rose by 10 per cent in 1992 to about Pounds 1.7bn.
W&amp;P would also benefit from Circle K's modern retail computer system, based
on electronic point of sale systems used by supermarkets but tailored to
convenience stores' needs.
About a fifth of the W&amp;P's pre-tax profits, which fell to Pounds 10.3m
(Pounds 11.8m) in the 53 weeks to October 30 1992, derived from retail
stores, but that share would increase to 35 per cent. Circle K would be run
initially as an autonomous business alongside W&amp;P's cash and carry, catering
services, retail stores, and retail services divisions.
Circle K management accounts show pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.8m for the
eight months to November 29 last year, compared with Pounds 1m (Pounds
832,000) on sales of Pounds 125m (Pounds 126m) in the year to March 29. W&amp;P
will assume its net borrowings of Pounds 3.3m, but benefit from Pounds 24m
in unused tax losses.
In March 1991, management at Circle K staged a buy-out of the company from
owners Circle K Corporation of the US and News International, Mr Rupert
Murdoch's media group. Circle K Corporation, which owns 3,400 stores in 32
states, has traded under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 1990.

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Strike doubles loss at GM Firth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRIKE at its steel rolling mill, Spartan Redheugh, was principally blamed
by GM Firth (Holdings) for a doubling of its pre-tax loss, from Pounds
712,000 to Pounds 1.5m, in the half year to September 30.
The knock-on effect on its steel stockholding subsidiary, one of the mill's
principal customers, together with high interest charges and 'what was
probably the worst market for steel since the 1930s', all contributed to the
loss.
Mr Michael Wilkinson, the chairman, said that accordingly the group's
principal aim in recent months had been to resolve the strike and
significantly reduce borrowings.
In October, as part of restructured banking arrangements, it was agreed to
sell Spartan but the directors have since decided to keep it within the
group.
In December the strike was resolved and Mr Wilkinson said there had been no
erosion of its customer base, particularly for the higher quality products.
Although Spartan's ability to expand was restricted by a shortage of working
capital, that position would be eased when the new bank facilities were in
place, he said. Borrowings had fallen from Pounds 14.6m on April 1 1992 to
about Pounds 6.6m at present.
Mr Wilkinson added that trading losses had continued into the second half
and the company had pruned its steel stockholding activities in line with
the reduced market.
Turnover in the period dropped to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 23.4m). Losses per
share worked through at 4.46p (1.85p) and again there is no dividend.
The Pounds 1.87m loss on the sale of Arthur Lee shares in October and
November coupled with costs relating to the restructured banking
arrangements would be shown in the figures for the second half, the chairman
said.
Last week it was disclosed that Mr Roger Shute, president of BM, the
industrial holding company, had bought a 4.4 per cent stake in Firth.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Thomas French lower and selling loss-maker
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER THE adoption of new accounting requirements and paying Pounds 103,000
to a former director, Thomas French &amp; Sons has seen its pre-tax profit fall
from a restated Pounds 285,000 to Pounds 110,000 in the year ended October 3
1992.
The group also announced the sale of Kaz Krafts, which incurred a pre-tax
loss of Pounds 210,000 in the period, to Legend Fine Art for some Pounds
200,000 cash. The group's overall focus was now more strongly directed to
the core activities of curtain tape and window accessories.
Earnings per share fell from 5.51p to 0.19p, with the continuing businesses
accounting for 4.58p (6.86p). They were arrived at after adding back payment
to director of Pounds 68,000 net, and adjustments for discontinued
operations of Pounds 443,000 net.
A maintained final dividend of 2.175p is proposed for an unchanged total of
3.625p.
Although the signs were for continuing recession the first quarter of the
current year had gone well, said Mr Jeremy French, chairman.
The curtain tape business acquired from British Trimmings last June was
performing to expectations and benefit was coming from the elimination of
loss-making activities. Net borrowings were Pounds 2.15m, giving gearing of
40 per cent.
Turnover in continuing activities in 1991-92 fell 3 per cent to Pounds 12.8m
generating a trading profit of Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 1.26m) while losses in
discontinued businesses fell from Pounds 337,000 to Pounds 189,000.
Charges for losses on sale or closure of discontinued business, including
Pounds 173,000 of goodwill previously written off, were Pounds 382,000
(Pounds 334,000).

FT  29 JAN 93 / PepsiCo in Cadbury Schweppes drink deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES OF Cadbury Schweppes soft drinks in eastern Europe are set to rise
sharply as a result of a franchise deal with PepsiCo of the US, which may
lead to further co-operation between the two companies in the region.
The deal is the first between the two companies since the mid-1980s, when
Cadbury Schweppes abruptly ended a bottling agreement with Pepsi in the UK
and placed all its British soft drinks businesses in a joint venture with
Coca-Cola, Pepsi's arch-rival.
Pepsi will bottle and distribute Cadbury Schweppes brands, including
Schweppes and Canada Dry, in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and
Slovakia. Initial annual output will exceed 10m cases and is expected at
least to double in five years.
The companies plan to explore similar arrangements in other parts of eastern
Europe, where Pepsi has operations in every country except Albania. It has
operated in the former Soviet Union since the early 1970s and is investing
Dollars 150m (Pounds 98m) in Ukraine. Until now, Hungary and Bulgaria have
been the only eastern European countries in which Cadbury soft drinks have
been sold.
Some observers believe yesterday's agreement could lead to a much closer
partnership, which could eventually extend to other parts of the world.
'It is a very important development in terms of what may lie ahead,' said Mr
Jessie Meyers, editor of Beverage Digest, a US publication which monitors
the soft drinks industry, 'This is a tryst which could turn into a date and
maybe even marriage.'
Two years ago, Pepsi ended a bottling franchise with Cadbury in Spain.
Cadbury still bottles Pepsi products in southern Spain and France, while
Pepsi has long distributed Cadbury drinks in parts of the US.
The eastern Europe deal will help strengthen Pepsi's product range in the
face of increased competition in eastern Europe from Coca-Cola. Although
Pepsi claims three times Coke's sales in the region, Coke is investing more
than Dollars 1bn there in an effort to catch up.
Soft drink consumption per head in eastern Europe is less than a tenth of US
levels and about a quarter of that in western Europe.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Two large carriers announce big losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE turmoil persisting in the US airline industry yesterday caused two of
the largest carriers, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, to post heavy
losses for the final three months of 1992, and for the year overall.
UAL, United's parent company, said that it made an after-tax loss of Dollars
184m (Pounds 122m) in the final three months of the year, excluding one-off
charges, and registered a Dollars 370m deficit for the year.
Delta made a net loss of Dollars 126.3m in the October to December period.
Delta accompanied news of the latest losses with an announcement that Mr
Whitley Hawkins, its president, will retire in March after 38 years with the
company. Mr Ron Allen, Delta's chairman, will add the roles of president and
chief operating officer to his existing responsibilities, for 'the
indefinite future'.
Delta and United are two of the nation's 'big three' mega-carriers. The
third, American Airlines, has already posted a Dollars 475m after-tax loss
for 1992 (before one-off accounting-related charges).
The latest red ink means that 1992 will be third year in which the US
airline industry has made a multi-billion dollar loss; net losses from the
nine largest US carriers topped Dollars 3bn in 1990, and exceeded Dollars
1.6bn in 1991.
'Unacceptable is the only way to describe our fourth quarter results,' said
Mr Stephen Wolf, United chairman. 'The industry remains in a state of
chaos.'
Delta echoed this, blaming the December quarter loss on 'the continuing
effect of uneconomical fare levels due to the implementation of a simplified
fare structure earlier in 1992, discount fare promotions, and a weak
worldwide economy.'
Both airlines are currently engaged in major cost-cutting exercises, and are
talking to aircraft manufacturers about further reductions and rescheduling
of new aircraft orders. This month, United institigated a cost-cutting plan
involving the axing of 2,800 jobs and the cancellation of plans to hire
another 1,900, as part of an effort to slash Dollars 400m from annual
operating expenses.
Delta shares were down  1/8 at Dollars 51, while UAL were down Dollars 3 1/4
at Dollars 122 1/4 .

FT  29 JAN 93 / BHF and Credit Commercial poised to buy Charterhouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL BANK of Scotland is poised in the next few days to announce the
long-awaited sale of 90 per cent of Charterhouse, its merchant banking
subsidiary.
In a deal expected to value Charterhouse at around Pounds 200m, BHF, a
German bank, and Credit Commercial de France, the French bank, are each
expected to buy 45 per cent of Charterhouse. RBS is expected to retain a 10
per cent holding.
RBS has been looking for a buyer for Charterhouse since January last year.
Negotiations with the French and German institutions, which are being
advised by the UK merchant bank Schroders, have been dragging on for several
months, according to a banker with an intimate knowledge of the talks. Talks
are now entering their final phase.
RBS, advised by SG Warburg, has been holding out for an improved price,
though bankers are now hopeful that the two sides are not far apart. However
one banker added: 'Until the deal is signed, something could still go
wrong.'
If completed, the deal would be the first time that a UK merchant bank had
been bought by a Franco-German banking partnership. CCF and BHF, which both
have investment banking operations of their own, aim to build up a
pan-European merchant banking business with Charterhouse at its centre.
CCF and BHF were found separately by RBS as possible buyers of Charterhouse.
However, CCF and BHF already knew each other well and each holds 1 per cent
of the other's shares.
A price of Pounds 200m for Charterhouse is equivalent to a small premium to
the net value of Charterhouse's assets. These net assets are shown in its
last balance sheet as being worth Pounds 136.6m at September 30, but that
figure takes no account of its hidden, undisclosed reserves, which are
thought to total around Pounds 50m.
Charterhouse has been a successful investment for RBS, which paid Pounds
150m for it in January 1985 and has since taken out dividends totalling more
than Pounds 120m. In the autumn of last year, it withdrew Pounds 61.4m in a
cash dividend from the merchant bank, which has consistently earned a return
on capital over the past few years between 12 per cent at its low point in
1990 and well above 20 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE US economy grew at a surprisingly robust annual rate of 3.8 per cent in
the final quarter of last year, the fastest pace since 1988, the Commerce
Department reported yesterday.
The growth mainly reflected a surge in consumption, which grew at an annual
rate of 4.3 per cent relative to the previous quarter. The economy grew by
2.1 per cent in 1992 as a whole, a sharp rebound after a decline of 1.2 per
cent in 1991.
However, senior advisers to President Bill Clinton believe the figures
overstate the economy's underlying growth rate and are continuing to urge a
modest economic stimulus worth Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn (Pounds
9.8bn-Pounds 13bn) this year to ensure growth does not falter again, as it
did in 1991 and 1992.
After meeting yesterday with Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, Mr Clinton welcomed the figures. However, he said there was also
'a lot of troubling news about jobs' - a reference to a wave of recent job
cuts at leading US companies including International Business Machines and
Sears Roebuck.
The expansion in the fourth quarter followed growth at an annual rate of 3.4
per cent in the third quarter. It was the seventh successive quarter of
growth after a brief contraction in the winter of 1990-91.
Testifying before the Senate budget committee, Mr Greenspan said economic
growth rates in the next six months were likely to be 'somewhat lower' than
in the fourth quarter. He also signalled support for Mr Clinton's target of
a Dollars 145bn cut in the budget deficit within four years.
'I don't find that number to be off base,' he said. However deficit
reduction would be seen as credible in financial markets only if it involved
specific cuts in programmes rather than vague 'caps' or targets.
Economists said the breakdown of growth was encouraging. It did not reflect
temporary factors such as a rebuilding of inventories by companies.
The growth of consumption reflected a bigger than expected rise in
disposable incomes rather than a further reduction in the personal savings
rate, which stabilised at about 4.5 per cent.
Investment spending was also stronger than anticipated. Corporate equipment
investment grew at an annual rate of 11.7 per cent relative to the previous
quarter, while residential investment surged by 29 per cent, reflecting a
recovery in the housing market.
Inflation remained subdued, with a broad index rising at an annual rate of
2.8 per cent.
Mr David Wyss, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, the forecasting group,
said: 'We can't keep up growth at 3.8 per cent. But decent growth of
something like 3 per cent is likely this quarter.' Mr Bill Griggs, a Wall
Street bond market analyst, said growth might be as low as 2 per cent at an
annual rate in the current quarter, reflecting overspending by consumers at
Christmas.

THE BUNDESBANK president yesterday dismissed an idea, promoted by French and
German leaders, that a select group of European Community countries could
establish monetary union ahead of schedule.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger also warned that monetary stability had to be restored
in Germany before there could be any further progress towards Emu.
The Maastricht treaty 'states clearly that Emu can only start, in 1997, if a

a speech in Brussels. 'I am sticking to the text . . . The next time is
1999. I have no intention of shortening the period,' he told a press

without the Benelux countries'.
While he did not name the source of the speculation, he was apparently
responding in part to recent statements from Chancellor Helmut Kohl and

They agreed in a television interview that it could be possible to

Mr Schlesinger underlined his opposition to his chancellor's ambitions with
a sharp reminder of the economic difficulties to be overcome in united

The country suffered from huge regional income differentials and structural
problems unequalled anywhere else in the Community.
Such difficulties had affected inflation rates, but stability had to be
regained.
It was in the interests of all EC member states that the country with the
anchor currency - the D-Mark - should be able to return to full stability.
This was 'a prerequisite for any move forwards on the road towards Emu',
said Mr Schlesinger.
He added that in the run-up to the establishment of a European central bank,
national central banks had to retain responsibility for monetary policy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sang froid of MFI's management offers a soothing contrast to the
company's trading performance since sterling left the ERM. Despite the sharp
fall in interest rates, turnover is down, and this January's sale compares
poorly with last year's. Indeed, the company seems more sensitive to
increases in unemployment and the declining housing market than to cuts in
interest rates. Last autumn's heavy redundancies hit the blue-collar workers
who are MFI's natural customers. With consumers still keen to reduce debt,
expensive domestic purchases like kitchens are likely to remain a low
priority when recovery eventually starts.
Of course MFI is still generating cash and has an enviable return on
capital, even at the low point of the cycle. When the housing market picks
up, profits will certainly rise sharply. But timing is all. Even if MFI
meets the City's profits expectations for the next financial year, the
company will still be at a 20 per cent premium to the sector. The risk
remains that those expectations will be frustrated. The management's
readiness to blame market conditions might be more palatable if it were not
going to take at least another 18 months to return to the profit level
achieved before last summer's flotation.

FT  29 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Stakis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having sold its nursing homes, Stakis is no longer in need of nursing care.
That does not mean a clean bill of health, however. Almost by chance, since
its first instinct was to sell its casinos, it is left with a well-balanced
business in which the leisure division should provide the cash to help
develop hotels. Stakis is well rid of 20 unproductive nursing home sites
whose value is falling and which it cannot afford to develop.
Still, the extent of the write-down associated with the healthcare sale does
not inspire confidence. The hotels are unlikely to suffer quite such pain
when they are reviewed at the end of the year, but some downward adjustment
is inevitable. True gearing is thus somewhat higher than the new indication
of 42 per cent. While interest cover remains tight and room rates depressed
Stakis must still count as a convalescent.

FT  29 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to blame Britain's striking propensity to import on structural
imbalance in the economy. The harder question is the matter of degree.
While yesterday's import figures were made even more horrible by the
notorious J-curve effect, the data also show import volume slowed sharply
after September's devaluation. The logical explanation is that imports were
pushed up by an overvalued exchange rate while the UK was in the ERM.
Now that problem has been corrected, one could hope for slower import growth
than would normally be expected in a recovery. That depends, though, on how
domestic manufacturers use the leeway created by devaluation. If they are
determined to push up margins at the first opportunity, they will rapidly
lose competitive edge. The example set by exporters is not particularly
encouraging. The value of their sales rose noticeably faster in the last
quarter than the volume.

FT  29 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The window of opportunity for rights issues may not stay open for long. It
is not so much that institutional coffers will run dry. Life companies and
pension funds can always run down cash balances or borrow short-term if the
opportunities are too good to miss. Moreover, institutions see no good
reason to buy bonds at current yields and, even allowing both for a hefty
government offering of BT shares this year and a large cash call from ICI
when it does the splits, their enthusiasm for equities would be far from
satisfied. Whether that will still be the case when the government's funding
programme gets under way in earnest is another matter.
Lower short-term interest rates and a devalued currency amount to a strong
case for equities. But if the US experience is anything to go by, the 4 per
cent fall in base rates since sterling left the ERM will take some months to
feed into the real economy. That leaves plenty of time for disappointment
before real recovery emerges. If long gilt yields are also soon on a rising
trend, the equity market will be hard pressed to sustain its optimistic
mood. The government may find a way - perhaps by regulatory requirement or
by issuing index-linked stock - of attracting institutions into gilts
without the need for higher yields. That would mean less cash for rights
issues.

FT  29 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Asda stocks up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market so loves a recovery story that it seems inclined to forgive
past disappointments. Yesterday, Asda swept in to collect another Pounds
347m of cash thereby pre-empting a pipeline of rights issues it believed was
developing. The move came earlier than Asda would have liked. It therefore
had scanty trading evidence with which to back its bold assertions. But
investors did not seem to care. They marked the shares up 8 per cent anyway.
This enthusiasm is unnerving for the food retailing sector. In the last
couple of years, investors have handed over more than Pounds 2bn to grocery
chains to fund expansion. They have also bid the sector up to a five-year
high. But many of the retailers' expansion plans were based on the premise
that others would drop out. Instead, there are likely to be six
well-financed grocers in the FT-SE 100 by the year-end.
Of these, Asda will still look the most vulnerable. At one level, all it
will achieve through its two rights issues is to refinance its near-ruinous
acquisition of 60 Gateway superstores. Its mountain of expensive short-term
debt will be replaced by Pounds 700m of cheaper equity finance. The critical
question remains whether Asda can successfully re-ignite growth. So far, the
new management has excelled at squeezing improved profits from its Pounds
4bn sales base. But this process will soon run its course. Asda's greater
financial leeway will enable it to revamp stores and launch its unproved
Dales discount chain. But the market is placing extraordinary faith in
Asda's long-term future in what increasingly looks like a zero-sum industry
game.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Pension industry faces big sales loss in next tax year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Department of Social Security has insisted that sellers of personal
pensions inform their clients about changes to tax rules which will make
them less attractive to hold.
Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life assurance industry, yesterday
was the first to issue guidelines requiring companies to contact clients for
whom it may no longer be worthwhile to maintain current personal pension
arrangements when new tax rules come into effect on April 6.
If the individuals follow this advice, it could mean the loss of billions of
pounds of premium income for the industry.
The other self-regulatory bodies, Fimbra, Imro and the Securities and
Investments Board, are also to issue guidelines in the next few weeks. The
guidelines say enforcement officials from the SROs (self regulatory
organisations) will be checking company records in the coming year to make
sure best advice is given.
'The government and regulators are keen to ensure that anyone considering
their pension provision receives the best possible advice,' the Department
of Social Security said.
There are roughly 5m holders of personal pensions in Britain. The product
has been the life insurance industry's single biggest source of new business
in the past year. Rebates of national insurance contributions (NICs) have
made them particularly attractive to young people although as individuals
age, the tax advantages disappear.
Industry officials estimate that one-half to two-thirds of all personal
pension holders are so-called 'rebate only'. That means that the only
contribution paid into their personal pensions are the rebate from their
NICs.
The new tax rules cut the rebate of NIC available to those who contract out
of the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps) via a personal pension.
This means that the age at which men should contract back into Serps could
fall to 40 from 45 at present and women should contract back in at 35
instead of 40. Currently, 750,000 personal pension holders are over 40. John
Willman writes: The ruling could produce short-term benefits for the
government's deficit. When people opt back into Serps, the exchequer saves
the national insurance rebates paid into personal pensions for those who opt
out.
In the longer term, however, the cost of paying Serps pensions would grow.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that if everyone eventually opted
back into Serps, the cost would be double the Pounds 15bn a year forecast
for 2030.

THE BUNDESBANK president yesterday squashed an idea, promoted by French and
German leaders, that a select group of European Community countries could

Mr Helmut Schlesinger also warned that monetary stability had to be restored
in Germany before there could be any further progress towards Emu.
The Maastricht treaty 'states clearly that Emu can only start, in 1997, if a

While he did not name the source of the speculation, he was apparently
responding in part to recent statements from Chancellor Helmut Kohl and

Mr Schlesinger underlined his opposition to his chancellor's ambitions with

It was in the interests of all EC member states that the country with the
anchor currency - the D-Mark - should be able to return to full stability.
This was 'a prerequisite for any move forwards on the road towards Emu'.
In the run-up to the establishment of a European central bank, national
central banks had to retain responsibility for monetary policy. 'This also
means that a country cannot be pressured to relax its monetary policy at a
stage when its fight against inflation has not yet been successful,' he
insisted.
Mr Schlesinger, who said he expected 4.4 per cent average inflation in
western Germany this month, made plain that the rate of price increases had
to slacken before interest rates could be reduced. However, he stressed,
monetary policy was not dictated by dogma.
'In cases where growth prospects have deteriorated and unemployment has
increased, the Bundesbank has never kept interest rates high longer than
necessary if there were signs of inflationary pressures easing,' he added.
Germany had slipped from near the top of the European prosperity scale to
the middle.
Despite a high rate of price increases in January, Mr Schlesinger said he
hoped west German inflation would fall this year to little more than 3 per
cent.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Personal View: Clearing up Britain's energy mess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The trade and industry select committee will today publish its report on
British energy policy and the market for coal. It will provide stark proof,
if any were needed, of the scale by which the government has botched the
privatisation of UK gas and electricity.
Far from opening the industry up to the forces of competition, we have seen
uneven bargaining in the marketplace. At the same time a conflict has
developed between short- and long-term factors, commercial interests and
strategic priorities for the nation.
Having served on the committees for the gas and electricity bills as well as
on the trade and industry committee I have seen the government plough on
with measures which distorted the market and led inevitably to the present
mess.
The nation was understandably outraged and confused at the sudden
announcement on October 19 that 31 pits were to close and 31,000 miners and
tens of thousands of other workers faced immediate dole.
Three questions arose. How had this come about? Was there a cheaper way of
spending taxpayers money than financing redundancy and unemployment? Why
were we abandoning, perhaps irretrievably, such a large amount of our
indigenous coal reserves?
To see how this arose it is necessary to look back into the government's
privatisation programme. British Gas fought successfully to be privatised as
a monopoly, despite strenuous argument that it should be broken up for a
genuine market to develop. The company was referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission as soon as it was privatised because of its dominance in
the industrial market. Ever since, Sir James McKinnon, the director of
Ofgas, the industry regulator, has been battling to open up a genuine market
for gas.
The opportunity to achieve this has been offered by the advent in the
electricity industry of combined-cycle gas turbine generation.
Eighteen months after gas privatisation, Cecil Parkinson, then secretary for
energy, told parliament he would not repeat the mistakes of gas
privatisation and would break up the industry. Yet his approach at the
outset was timid, and once it emerged that high costs and uncertainties over
reprocessing and decommissioning made nuclear power unsaleable, he was left
with a generating duopoly - National Power and PowerGen.
The regional electricity distributors, faced with two generators which owned
all the coal-fired power stations, were desperate to move into generation to
give them something with which to bargain. The dash for gas was on.
The coal industry was squeezed out of the market, and the generators refused
to be locked into major long-term coal contracts. British Coal, faced with
its own privatisation pressures, had no choice but to shut down pits.
The main market for coal is electricity supply. It does not have the
flexibility of oil and gas. Faced with new gas technology, a subsidised and
capacity-protected nuclear industry, subsidised French electricity, rising
imports of cheaper coal and environmental constraints, sharp decline was
inevitable.
Yet the industry is responding with new technology and changing working
practices. Its own forecasts and the assessment of independent experts all
say they can achieve world market prices within three to five years.
However, if the abrupt market change is allowed to work through, Britain
will not have the pits to meet the potential capacity, much of which will be
taken up by imports. With opening or re-opening a pit costing about Pounds
400m, reserves abandoned now will be lost forever. Had the government
liberalised the gas and electricity markets before privatisation, much of
the present debacle could have been avoided.
A generation ago there was a dash for oil that has left a succession of
white elephants - under-utilised oil-fired power stations. The gas stations
are unlikely to suffer that fate. But we desperately need a regime that
promotes genuine competition against a background that will secure a
strategic balance of a sensible and flexible fuel mix, the best use of our
indigenous reserves of all fuels and minimal long-term dependence on
imports.
The committee has had to address a serious short-term crisis produced by
ill-thought-out measures. British coal faces a strong challenge, but I
believe we have created a breathing space to address all these issues
without destroying confidence in any sector.

FT  29 JAN 93 / A controversial sense of duty: US penalties on steel imports
pose difficult choices for the global industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The penal dumping duties imposed this week on steel imports into the US have
brought predictable cries of protest from around the world. But for the
hard-pressed steel industry, the consequences are real enough. About 4m
tonnes of steel no longer have a home. Steelmakers in 19 countries, from
Australia to Argentina, must either find alternative markets or cut
production.
The choice could scarcely have come at a worse time. Worldwide, the steel
industry is struggling. In Japan, consumption fell more than 10 per cent
last year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development. In Europe, prices have fallen by about 30 per cent since 1989,
as a result of recession, domestic over-production, and cut-price imports
from eastern Europe.
Late last year Klockner-Werke, the smallest of Germany's main steel
producers, applied for protection from its creditors. Other European steel
producers will have to disappear or merge in 1993, Mr Francis Mer, chairman
of France's Usinor-Sacilor said yesterday.
World steel consumption overall, says the OECD, has fallen from a peak of
649m tonnes in 1989 to about 607m tonnes last year. Not all of this is due
to the economic downturn. Plastics and other lighter materials are taking
markets away from steel permanently. In mature economies no longer engaged
in heavy industrialisation, demand is in long-term decline anyway. And while
there is still strong underlying demand in developing countries, there are
also low-cost domestic producers increasingly able to supply it.
In the shorter term, according to the Sheffield-based steel consultancy,
MEPS Europe, the outlook for world demand is also poor. In Europe it is
likely to decline further this year, while the Japanese economy is not
expected to pick up until later in 1993. In the US market, meanwhile,
prospects are improving but the rate of growth is likely to be slow. The
Latin American producers may find their domestic markets more difficult, and
a further decline in production is expected in eastern Europe. As for
western Europe, according to Mr David Morgan of Lehman Brothers, the
stockbroker, gross domestic product needs to rise by 1.5 per cent simply to
keep steel demand steady.
This catalogue of problems puts the row over US imports into perspective.
That is not to say that the anti-dumping duties are not damaging. Temporary
duties imposed this week on carbon steel products were as high as 109 per
cent; and, as Mr Morgan says, 'any duty above 10 per cent is enough to choke
people out of a market'.
But for British Steel, which faces duties of 109 per cent on its steel plate
exports, the duties are described merely as 'an aggravation'. Its annual
sales of 35,000 tonnes of steel plate in the US, worth Pounds 7m, are
'equivalent to half a week's output at Scunthorpe', it says. Less than 20
per cent of its exports to the US is affected by the decision.
Among other European producers, Hoogovens of the Netherlands is, relative to
its total sales, one of the biggest exporters to the US. Usinor-Sacilor of
France and Italian and Spanish producers also export to the US. Mr Ekkehard
Schultz, management board chairman of Thyssen Stahl, the steel unit of
Germany's Thyssen group, says: 'The temporary duties imposed by the US would
have little effect on the company but would heighten tension on the European
market.'
Eurofer, the association of European steel producers, reacted gloomily to
the US action which, it said, would place 'a large question mark over the
immediate future of the EC steel market, the situation of which is already
worrying'. It predicted the duties would cause 'total disorder on the
international market'.
BHP of Australia, which expressed 'extreme surprise' yesterday at the
Commerce Department's ruling, sells about 135,000 tonnes of Australian
rust-resistant steel in the US.
In truth, the imposition of duties by the US Commerce Department is not all
bad news, especially for the European producers. There is frustration,
inevitably, at the partial loss of access to the world's second-biggest
steel market, just as confidence is returning to the economy. And while the
tonnages involved are low, the products tend to carry high profit margins.
But the overhanging threat of action by the Commerce Department had already
pushed up domestic US steel prices. Importers may be able to raise prices on
products not affected by the anti-dumping action, says Mr Jonathan Aylen,
senior lecturer in economics at Salford University.
Indeed, trade in many of the products affected by the anti-dumping decisions
had been cut back sharply in recent weeks. The release in November by the
Commerce Department of preliminary findings on countervailing duties - used
against alleged subsidies of foreign steelmakers - was a clear sign for
importers of how the wind was blowing.
It may not be coincidental that the threat of anti-dumping action coincided
with almost all leading European steel producers cutting their
fourth-quarter output by 15 per cent to 20 per cent. The forthcoming loss of
American sales 'concentrated producers' minds, which was probably a good
thing', according to Mr Edward Hadas of Morgan Stanley, the investment bank.
Total steel imports to the US market had, in any case, fallen from 20.9m
short tons (the US measure which is about 10 per cent less than a tonne) in
1988 to 15.8m in 1991. European producers were not expecting to recover the
shortfall, says Mr Hadas: the US industry has improved greatly from its
dilapidated state in the 1960s and 1970s, and should now be able to supply
the domestic market, barring some specialist products.
So what will be the fate of the 4m lost tonnes? Yesterday the message from
European producers was clear. Finding new markets is not an option. In any
case, they are already pursuing a different strategy, which concentrates on
keeping prices up rather than chasing volume.
Cockerill-Sambre, Belgium's largest steel producer, says it will raise
prices by 15 per cent to 20 per cent in the second quarter of the year,
following the lead set earlier this month by British Steel, Usinor-Sacilor
and Thyssen.
Success in raising prices cannot be guaranteed, however. Already, for
example, there have been rumblings of dissent from big customers in the
European automotive industry. And Europe's steel producers tried to push
prices up last year and failed, largely because of overproduction. They
appear genuinely determined, though, that it will be a different story in
1993, and the involvement of big companies in the price rises improves the
chances of making them stick.
At the same time, they are unlikely to raise production simply to recoup
lost sales in the US, for two reasons. First, alternative markets would be
extremely difficult to find in the present environment. Second and most
important, maintaining a disciplined approach to output will be a crucial
element in maintaining the price increases.
With virtually all European steelmakers losing money, the over-riding
priority for the industry is the successful implementation of measures which
are now being mooted by the European Commission to protect it. The European
Community's special steel envoy, Mr Fernand Braun, has been touring EC steel
companies in recent weeks to assess the extent of the crisis, and will be
submitting his recommendations next month. About Ecu500m could be available
to help steel producers cut capacity permanently, so short-term restraint on
output is in their long-term interests. The European industry wants
financial help to cover an expected 50,000 job losses over the next three to
four years. Observers believe Mr Braun's talks went well, suggesting that
companies realise they cannot expect rivals to make capacity cuts without
responding themselves.
Few, if any, of the other countries targeted by the Commerce Department will
find alternative markets easily. For east European producers on the list,
such as Poland and Romania, domestic markets have been ravaged by the
political and economic turmoil of the past three years, and further
cut-price imports to the EC would simply be used as ammunition by western
producers who claim that eastern products are unfairly subsidised.
Japanese producers will hardly find solace in their domestic market either.
Along with most of the world's steel producers, the anti-dumping action
traps them between a rock and a hard place.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clinton's trade agenda
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE announcement of provisional US anti-dumping duties on the steel exports
of 19 countries was bound to cause a reaction. What must be avoided however
is either an overreaction or the wrong reaction. The priority is to
encourage the new US administration in the right overall trade policy
direction, with completion of the Uruguay Round the immediate task.
This does not mean all is well with anti-dumping. Even Laura D'Andrea Tyson,
the new chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and self-proclaimed
'cautious activist', admits that 'as currently written and applied, both
national and multilateral anti-dumping laws err in the direction of
deterring competitive behaviour that is not unfair or predatory'. To put the
point more bluntly, the anti-dumping bureaucracy is like the sorcerer's
apprentice. The US Commerce Department routinely finds 97 per cent of all
foreign companies it investigates guilty of dumping. How do the other 3 per
cent escape?
There is no reason therefore to doubt the statement by Mr Ron Brown, the new
commerce secretary, that these findings, however untimely, are not policy
statements' but 'mandated procedures and the result of exhaustive
investigations'. It is the fundamental criteria which are wrong. But as an
equally enthusiastic user of the anti-dumping remedy, not least for steel,
the European Community is in no position to throw the first stone.
The sensible reaction would be a shrug of the shoulders. The desirable
reaction would be to seek US co-operation in attempts to modify the Gatt
code, with the aim of making the underlying economic criteria, which bias
the procedure in favour of findings of dumping, less economically
irrational. There is, alas, little chance of that.
Wrong reaction
The wrong reaction, though the most probable, would be for the EC to seek US
agreement to a voluntary export restraint on steel, to replace the one
terminated by the Bush administration last year. The world does not need
further cartelisation of its steel industry. Still less does it need a
precedent on which the US automobile industry will pounce. The EC should
instead recognise the absurdity of the global anti-dumping conspiracy, as
demonstrated in the ludicrous provisional duty of 109.22 per cent imposed on
the export of 35,000 tonnes of steel plate by British Steel, and then move
on.
It should focus instead on encouraging the Clinton administration to develop
a sensible trade strategy. The ill-assorted Clinton administration does not
know what it wants on trade. Many in Congress and industry do. They want to
bash 'unfair' foreigners and 'protect' supposedly endangered American jobs.
The multilateral alternative needs to be made credible. Under current law,
however, the US administration needs to notify Congress by March 2 that it
intends to proceed towards a deal on the Uruguay Round of multilateral
negotiations. This now seems unlikely.
Two alternatives
The administration has two realistic alternatives: to seek a relatively
short but unencumbered extension of its 'fast-track' negotiating authority,
with a view to early completion of the round on the basis of what has
already been agreed; or to obtain a longer extension, with the aim of
reopening large parts of it.
Both procedures would be risky. But the second looks like euthanasia for the
round. To reopen discussion of such issues as agriculture, intellectual
property, anti-dumping, subsidies, standards and the creation of a
multilateral trading organisation, when negotiators have not yet agreed on
market access, would almost amount to restarting the round. It would call
into question both the good faith of the US as a negotiating partner and the
credibility of multilateral trade negotiations.
This is what Sir Leon Brittan, the new EC external trade commissioner,
should be telling his American interlocutors. For perhaps the first time in
the postwar era, the US administration does not believe instinctively in the
importance of the multilateral trading system. But Sir Leon does. Leadership
now rests with him and with the EC. The Clinton administration needs to be
cajoled towards expeditious compromises on the outstanding issues in the
Uruguay Round. All else is secondary.

After months of trawling the City, Norman Lamont - or rather his financial
secretary, Stephen Dorrell - has found a new special adviser. Swiss Bank
Corp's Rupert Darwall is hardly a household name in the City, unlike his
predecessor, Alastair Ross Goobey.
But the 31-year-old is the one adviser earmarked for his feel for the
markets and what the City is thinking. He is a protege of John Major's
former political secretary, Judith Chaplin, and comes from the 'dry' end of
the Tory party, being the sort of fellow who feels that the benefits of the
Thatcher period are being wasted.
Darwall has no problems in accepting a sizeable salary cut, because he
regards the sacrifice as an investment in the 'long-term quality of his
earnings'.
Best known in the City for his work as a transport economist, Darwall is
confident that his job security will not be threatened by any change at 11
Downing Street.
Even so, it is not all that long since a still better-known transport
economist had a part in certain upheavals right next door.
Anyone remember Sir Alan Walters?

Whatever other sorts of soldiers do, ex-paratroopers apparently never even
fade away. Take for example the performance of near 77-year-old Sydney Robin
at yesterday's Control Securities annual meeting.
Pressed to take on the executive chairmanship when former boss Nazmu Virani
was arrested in connection with the BCCI affair, Robin has been working full
time trying to balance the competing claims of banks, shareholders and
bondholders.
Those who remember him at Great Universal Stores - he was known to take off
a shoe in a meeting and bang it on the table Khrushchev-style - will not be
surprised at the success of the tough line he took with the shareholders.
All the resolutions were carried, and the proceedings were over by 10am.
That led Robin to sympathise with the assembled company, who'd been called
out for a 9 o'clock start in case the meeting carried on for hours. He
himself had been in the office since 7.

It may be old hat these days to talk about there being reds under the bed.
But it is rare indeed to find a public figure who has actually shared one
with miners' leader Arthur Scargill, especially when the figure is Richard
Caborn, Labour chairman of the cross-party committee which is about to
reveal how to save Britain's coal industry.
Caborn, MP for Sheffield Central, says the reason for the sleeping
partnership was that his brother David was a friend of both Scargill and
former shipbuilders' union chief, Jimmy Reid, who used to visit the Caborn
family's small house and occasionally stay overnight.
But the MP stresses that, although he shared a bed with the fiery miner,
they did not share a pillow. They slept head to toe.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Leading Article: The lessons of Lambeth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF MANY of its local councils were like Lambeth, Britain would be better off
without local government.
Fortunately they are not. Nor is the 'unprecedented corruption' uncovered by
the south London borough's chief executive the tip of an iceberg of town
hall fraud and malpractice. However, Lambeth's predicament is but an extreme
and grotesque form of two ills which do afflict local government as a whole:
the inadequacy of arrangements for monitoring expenditure and efficiency;
and acute weaknesses in political leadership and control.
There is no simple panacea, but significant improvements could be expected
from four reforms: the use of proportional representation to elect
councillors; a strengthening of internal council procedures for monitoring
spending and efficiency; remuneration sufficient to attract to local
leadership people with successful track records in the world outside; and
the guaranteeing of a stable constitutional position for local government.
The case for PR is far stronger at the local than at the national level.
Local elections return not a government but a group of councillors
collectively responsible for running their authority. Moreover, while the
heterogeneous make-up of the national electorate almost invariably ensures
both a strong government and a strong opposition, the more homogeneous
territory of most councils makes the return of a numerous opposition less
assured. Barnsley currently has one non-Labour councillor. In eight of
London's 32 boroughs, three-quarters of the seats are controlled by one
party. For much of the 1980s, Lambeth had a far-left majority administration
endorsed by barely a third of its electorate.
Single-tier authorities
The Local Government Commission looks set to make relatively small,
single-tier authorities the norm for England, and similar proposals are in
play for Scotland and Wales. If implemented, the current electoral system
could prove still more damaging in the future than in the past. PR should be
introduced as part of the new structure, preferably in a form retaining ward
divisions so that electors continue to have named councillors at their
service.
Breaking single-party monopolies will itself help to improve internal
monitoring. But reforms to councils' internal structures are also needed.
District auditors and the Audit Commission have done commendable work in
promoting best practice and highlighting inefficiency. Within individual
authorities, however, few councillors have taken much interest in those
tasks, except when forced to by compulsory competitive tendering. The job
has mostly been left to officers, who should themselves be a principal
object of scrutiny.
Quality leadership
Councillors need to give monitoring a high priority. To encourage them to do
so, there should be a clear institutional separation between committees
responsible for voting money to spend - the 'policy and resources committee'
in most authorities - and committees (mostly non-existent at present)
charged with overseeing the expenditure and investigating value for money.
In short, they need mini-public accounts committees. Ideally, their
membership should not overlap with that of P&amp;R, and they should have their
own dedicated staff.
At the end of the day, a council is only as good as its members. The quality
of today's council leaders is mixed at best. Remuneration is part of the
problem. At present, not even the leaders of metropolitan authorities are
salaried, and the allowances available even to leaders of the opposition and
chairmen of principal committees are derisory. There is much to be said for
maintaining the tradition of voluntary service in local government; but not
for those posts carrying direct responsibility for budgets of millions.
Leaders of the larger authorities should be full-time and paid.
Yet money is not everything. Councils will only attract high calibre
recruits if they have a secure future. The government has declared a truce
in its war with town halls, but ministers continue to advance proposals to
strip functions from local authorities, while emasculating their autonomy
over spending. Restoring the integrity of local democracy will take more
than smooth words.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Letter: 'Clarification' has only complicated competitive
tendering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NORMAN WILLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, No doubt Mr Michael Forsyth was trying to be helpful in his letter
(January 22) explaining the application of the EC Business Transfers
Directive in the UK. Indeed, he was merely repeating the views expressed by
the attorney general on January 21 at the standing committee considering the
Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill.
Unfortunately, this 'clarification' complicates the situation and gives no
assistance to those trade unions, private contractors and local authorities
seeking to understand how the directive applies to compulsory competitive
tendering. Equally it does nothing to explain why government departments
have adopted different (and contradictory) approaches to the effects which
the directive may have on a range of other transfers from the public to the
private sector - market testing, tendering in the National Health Service,
etc.
The TUC welcomes the government's proposals in the bill to remedy the
defective implementation of the EC Directive in the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981. However, what we are also
looking for is clear and definitive guidance from the government on whether
the regulations will protect the rights of those people at work affected by
CCT and market testing.
It is simply not sufficient for the Department of Employment to abdicate
responsibility and say that whether the regulations apply is a question of
trust to be determined by the courts. Litigation is a lengthy and expensive
process which all the parties affected by the present situation wish to
avoid.
The decisions of the European Court of Justice in the field are clear, and
it is for the government to explain the relationships between these
judgments, the regulations and government policy.
The fact is that the principle behind the directive is a fundamental one:
that the interests of employees should be protected where transfers of
undertakings take place. Any proposal to withdraw this limited but essential
right would fly in the face of the basis of Community social policy, which
is that the objective of policy should not prevent change but ensure that
the interests of the workforce are protected as change takes place.
That has the supplementary benefit of tending to reduce the opportunities
for short-term employer strategies which would unermine the competitive edge
of the Community in the longer term. That is why the government's argument
for a derogation from or withdrawal of the directive is unlikely to find
favour with other Community member states.
We would therefore welcome a clear statement from ministers on the steps
which employers must take to ensure full compliance with the directive. We
need to know which operations in the government's view are relevant
transfers and which are not. Norman Willis,

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
Britain's establishment is not at ease with itself. There is disquiet in the
upper ranks. It goes beyond concern about the latest unemployment figures,
or the balance of payments deficit, or the ballooning of the public sector
borrowing requirement. The winter does not help. The recession certainly has
a lot to do with it. But it is more than that. The chattering classes, whose
perceptions sometimes influence the rest of the nation, are once again
telling one another that all is not quite right with the state of affairs on
these islands.
I record this with apologies to my former boss, Sir Geoffrey Owen, who wrote
in these pages last week that 'exaggerated gloom about all things British is
unnecessary and counter-productive'. Quite so. Our post-1945 history has not
been all gloom and bust. Yet confidence in the British polity seems to me to
be sagging.
One reason is that the keystone of our constitution, the throne, is looking
shaky. Mr Jack Straw, an opposition frontbencher, has voiced the opinion of
many in the Labour party that the monarchy should be reformed. A weekend
report suggested that perhaps a quarter of Labour members are republicans.
Loyal defenders of the Queen are to be found in all sections of the House of
Commons. They constitute a solid majority. The difficulty arises when the
talk is of her successor. Then there is a division of opinion, a general
shuffling of feet.
If the Prince of Wales divorces his wife, it will be incongruous for him to
become 'supreme governor' of the Church of England. Yet in order to succeed
his mother, he would have to adopt the role of temporal head of the Anglican
church. This prospect has stimulated a modest revival of the centuries-old
debate about whether the church should become disestablished, or separated
from the state. If - when - it does, an ancient appendage of the English
constitution will have fallen away. According to figures in the government's
statistical annual, Social Trends, we may one day be talking of having an
Established Mosque to take its place. Since 1975, the number of Moslems in
Britain has more than doubled, to just less than a million. In the same
period, Anglican church membership fell from 2.27m to 1.84m.
The church is painfully aware of this. Dr John Habgood, the archbishop of
York, is no disestablishmentarian. He has, however, proposed that the
coronation oath be adjusted to reaffirm religious freedom for all. He was
principally motivated, I suspect, by Christian ecumenism. This deserves
strong support. Yet the assertion, contained in our education laws, that
Britain is predominantly Christian is belied by the decline in the
membership of most churches.
If we cannot be certain of either the C of E or the next king, what is left?
For some, the national spirit has long been bolstered by Britain's position
as a principal player on the world stage. This week Mr Douglas Hurd
contrived to bring us down to earth. 'Britain simply does not have the
option of turning its back on the wider world,' he said. But that is not the
whole story. Pluck out another sentence from the foreign secretary's speech:
'Obviously we cannot be everywhere and we cannot do everything.' And a
third: 'Where we act, our action must be proportionate.' Most tellingly, Mr
Hurd warned that 'We shall probably have to say 'no' more often than 'yes'.'
One purpose of this important lecture was to ward off American demands that
more British troops be sent to Bosnia. It was, however, more significant
than that. It marked a further ratcheting-down of Britain's global reach.
Our army is overstretched, and under budgetary constraint. Admitting as
much, Mr Hurd pointed out that we have an excellent diplomatic service. He
did not say that in dealings with other countries and international bodies
the Foreign Office's quickness of tongue often disguises the slightness of
its hand. This cannot go on forever. Sooner or later the UN Security Council
will be reformed. When that happens, Britain will be lucky to keep its place
as a permanent member.
There are other possible explanations for our generally pessimistic mood.
The national political pulse is not stimulated when the same political party
wins four general elections in a row. The Conservatives have been through a
bad five years. Things started to go wrong in 1988, when the then Mrs
Margaret Thatcher's government was overflowing with pride. The splits over
Europe, the resignations, the poll tax, the toppling of the former prime
minister all followed. The Tories have never really recovered. Today a
divided party is barely supporting a government with a shrunken
parliamentary majority. There is no solace in looking to the opposition. It
is not in any shape to inspire us, let alone win an election. As matters
stand, it looks as if the existing, less than glorious government can
continue in office for many more years.
It is, however, a weak administration. I like this: the less power ministers
command, the better. But the British psyche is conditioned to expect strong
government. That means that when the cabinet decides something, it is
automatically passed by the Commons. This is not happening. The combination
of a low majority and a divided party has the government running scared.
Some parliamentary select committees are beginning to exercise a degree of
influence over the administration that they previously only dreamed of.
Backbenchers' opinions are actually being solicited by ministers. To the
traditional English way of thinking this is a minor revolution. It is as
disturbing as all the tiresome talk about the monarchy, the church and our
role in the world.
I prefer to give this kaleidoscope a twist. The picture becomes brighter.
Look: the monarchy is reformed. Church and state are to be disentangled.
People start going to church again. Look again: we tailor our foreign policy
according to our cloth. The political marketplace forces Labour to become an
electable opposition. The emergence of a parliament that can check the
cabinet is generally welcomed. With experience, this government improves.
The economic cycle has not been abolished. Spring is on the way.
The two latter propositions are undeniable. The rest are merely items on a
wish-list.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Letter: Software houses bear high costs of SE's Taurus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DUNCAN PATERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Waters's article, 'Taurus the octopus' (January 22), mentioned
the increasing costs of Taurus to London's already pressed securities
industry. However, one major group of participants in Taurus was not even
mentioned: the software houses. My company, along with several others, took
the initiative to start building systems for Taurus back in 1990, before we
had obtained any firm client commitments. We made this decision because of
the complexity of the project and the tight time-scales put out by the
London Stock Exchange.
To date, it is largely the software houses that have taken the brunt of the
continuing delays and changes to Taurus. We have made a substantial
investment both in terms of direct and opportunity costs and we are a long
way from retrieving an acceptable return on this investment. As well as
having been overlooked in your article, this has not generally been
recognised by the potential Taurus participants either. The larger software
houses, such as my own, are in a position to withstand this, but there must
be some serious concern about our smaller brethren.
Finally I am astonished that the exchange had to be persuaded to introduce
the extra phase of 'many-to-many-testing'. This seems fundamental to such a
complex system and gives insight into the overoptimistic approach taken by
the exchange to Taurus.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Letter: War won in the east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN HINZE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse cannot be serious in his column, 'The greatest years may
lie ahead' (January 25), when he compares the US today with Britain in 1815
and then states that the US has '. . .just won a lengthy and debilitating
war against communism'.
Surely, it was the peoples of eastern Europe who recently overthrew their
former overlords (although what they are now making of their 'peace' is of
course a separate issue).
Since the end of the cold war era, American spending on overthrowing
communism has been minimal compared with the sums directed at the third
world.
Michael Prowse did not mention these burdens, principally carried by the
financial sector of the US economy, which have been the main cause of what
little debilitation the American economy has actually suffered in the last
decade.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Letter: German rail privatisation has simplicity not seen in
BR plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERNEST GODWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re your leader, 'Privatising British Rail' (January 26), the
privatisation of the rail system in Germany bears no comparison with that
proposed in the UK. Herr Heinz Durr, chairman of the Deutsche Bundesbahn
(DB) and the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR), has explained recently how the two
railways will be brought together and privatised. It will be in three
phases:
The first would bring DB and DR together to form DB AG. The German
constitution and laws are changed to permit this. The huge debt burden
(currently DM60bn) is written off. Staff levels are reduced by moving civil
servants back to government (130,000 of the staff fall into this category).
The government invests DM100bn to modernise DR over a 10-year period.
A holding company would be formed with three separate operating subsidiaries
covering passenger, freight and Infrastructure. The companies would move
gradually into being less controlled by government.
By 2002 the holding company would disappear leaving the three operating
companies in the private sector. Each rail operating company can set its own
goals and hopefully compete against the other modes of transport.
The privatisation of the German railways has a degree of simplicity which is
not found in BR's over complex proposals. As with the deregulation and
privatisation of the bus industry in the mid-1980s the likely outcome of
such complex legislation is likely to be less competition, higher fares and
rates, and less freight and passengers carried.
The possibility that lines will be closed is very real. The lack of
investment over the next few years also puts at risk the UK railway supply
industry. Uncertainty over investment levels and long lead times mean that
by the time new private railway operators can get established, UK railway
manufacturers may have gone to the wall.
Is Britain then to rely on suppliers based in the rest of Europe, the US and
Japan?
There is no coherent government policy or plans for the railways (or
transport for that matter). No recent government has sat down and stated
what the role of the railways should be in the national economy. Current
plans must be 'blown off course' as they do not offer the well-run railway
that the country needs. A discussion between the secretary of state for
transport and his German counterpart might not go amiss.

FT  29 JAN 93 / No mass yet to the market: Despite new services, UK mobile
'phone charges remain a deterrent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface, the UK's mobile communications industry has just entered an
intensely competitive phase. In the past few months, consumers have been
bombarded with advertising campaigns for three new services claiming to be
much cheaper than the standard cellular services, and at least four more are
to be launched later this year. Vodafone and Cellnet, the two established
cellular companies, spent about Pounds 20m on advertising in the last
quarter of 1992 and, despite the recession, their customers grew by 163,000
last year, more than double the 1991 growth.
The current marketing ferment gives the impression of a price war. Although
there are 1.4m cellular 'phone users in the UK - about twice as many as
Germany, France and Italy respectively - almost all are business users.
Observers believe the market could reach 10m by 2000, if the price is right.
Could the latest marketing be just what is needed to bring about a mass
market?
The answer is probably no, because prices have not fallen. For instance,
Vodafone's new Lowcall and Cellnet's new Lifetime services - jointly
nicknamed 'Lowlife' - have cheaper subscription charges than the companies'
standard cellular services, but higher call rates. The result is that
customers calling more than once a day actually pay more with the new
pricing packages.
The only large price discounting has come from Rabbit, a 'telepoint' service
run by Hutchison Telecom. But this is not a direct competitor to cellular,
since customers cannot receive incoming calls and can only make outgoing
calls in public places where they see the Rabbit sign. These limitations
explain why only 8,000 have signed up.
The mix of vigorous marketing and an absence of price cuts continues a
pattern which has been a feature of the cellular industry since its birth in
1985. The reason is that neither Vodafone nor Cellnet, owned jointly by BT
and Securicor, has an incentive to jeopardise substantial profits by
launching a price war. And there is no outside pressure to do so, since they
were established as a protected duopoly, not subject to price regulation.
Vodafone made operating profits of Pounds 152m from sales of Pounds 320m in
the six months to the end of last September - a margin of nearly 50 per
cent. Cellnet, which started losing market share in the late 1980s, made
operating profits of Pounds 75m from sales of Pounds 184m - still a margin
of over 40 per cent.
Could the entrance of competitors undermine this duopoly? That was certainly
the idea behind the government's decision in the late 1980s to license three
personal communications networks, a variation on cellular communications, as
Cellnet and Vodafone rivals.
But things have not worked out exactly as planned. Microtel, one of the new
networks, was sold when its backers got cold feet over raising the required
Pounds 1bn investment. There are still doubts over whether the new owners,
Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa and British Aerospace, are willing to put up
the cash.
This leaves Mercury Personal Communications, a merger of the two remaining
personal communication networks. A joint venture between the UK's Cable and
Wireless and US West, MPC plans to launch its service in the middle of the
year.
The new 'tripoly' will almost certainly be more competitive than the old
duopoly. But it remains to be seen how a market with two established players
and one entrant will work. The signs are that all parties wish to avoid a
price war. Mercury, in particular, has made clear that it does not want to
compete head-on for Vodafone's and Cellnet's existing customers.
This might seem odd. But MPC knows that a head-on attack would provoke a
price war, which it would not be well placed to win. This is because
initially its service will only be available in the south-east, while it
will need to subsidise handset prices by about Pounds 200 a customer because
they will be more expensive to make than standard cellular ones. Moreover,
its network design is such that it will only be profitable if it eventually
attracts more than 1m customers. 'I don't want to fight over 1.4m customers
because that is not enough,' explains Mr Richard Goswell, MPC's managing
director.
Instead, the company plans to develop a new segment of the market consisting
of small businesses and affluent consumers. Mr Goswell promises
'significantly' cheaper prices - rivals expect cuts of about 30 per cent -
to achieve this.
Its biggest discounts will be on the cost of making incoming calls, which
will be less than half current rates. MPC believes this will be an important
selling point. But its rivals cannot understand why MPC would give up a
large slice of easy revenue, when cutting incoming charges will not lower
customers' bills at all. Cellnet goes so far as to describe the move as
'mad'.
Nevertheless, MPC's segmentation approach suits Vodafone and Cellnet. It
seems to offer them a way of cutting prices for new customers, while keeping
margins high on existing business. Their strategy is to devise pricing
packages which appeal to new segments of the market but are not so generous
that the existing market is 'cannibalised'.
Vodafone has two initiatives planned. The first, called GSM and aimed at the
international executive, will allow customers to use their 'phones in many
other parts of Europe. It will cost 20 per cent more than the standard
service.
The second, MCN, will be in direct competition with MPC. Customers will
receive large discounts if they make local calls from their local areas, but
charges will rise if they make national calls or move outside their local
areas. Somebody driving along the motorway or in open countryside will pay
twice the current rate, which should deter many customers from switching.
A similar pricing package, LSM, is planned by Cellnet. It admits candidly:
'We'll get the impression of price wars but not the reality.'
All this means that 1993 will not witness the birth of a mass market. To
achieve that, prices would have to drop sharply. The average running costs
of Pounds 700-Pounds 800 are the main obstacle. Industry executives
acknowledge charges will have to fall by half to appeal.
But Vodafone's and Cellnet's fat profit margins give them both scope to make
discounts of that order and Mercury's network design means it will
eventually be driven to expand the market. So, although 1993 will see only
the appearance of a price war, the reality may not be that far off.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Arts: Power of the Bolshoy Effect - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sitting in the Albert Hall, surrounded by 3,000 eager Bolshoy Ballet
watchers, it is impossible not to feel that exhilaration which I can best
identify as 'The Bolshoy Effect'. It is a tribute to Moscow's Finest that,
over a period of 36 years and in a dozen theatres round the world (all of
them more congenial to the company than this hall), I have sensed this same
extraordinary power that the Bolshoy exerts over its public.
It has to do with bigness of scale, in production as in dance manner, so
that audiences surrender to the massive forces - emotional as well as
muscular - that are on display. It has to do with theatrical purpose, a
dedication to the work in hand, which touches every artist on stage. (In the
Stone Flower suite on Tuesday night, a gypsy girl and a hunchback musician
played a small drama at one edge of the stage with a conviction that must
have reached to the furthest eyries of the hall. Marvellous communicative
skill.) It has to do with the cinemascope swathes of energy and drama with
which Grigorovich paints his choreographic scenes.
The 'orgy' in Spartacus is a combination of roguishness and goose-stepping
(Walpurgisnacht at Berchtesgarten) that should make one laugh, and actually
works as drama. The fair scene in Stone Flower is Petrushka without the
puppets, and yet brilliantly conceived as dance-action, and even more
brilliantly done in its peasant enthusiasms. The street brawl in Romeo is a
whirlpool of bodies which convinces because at every moment the Bolshoy's
dancers are exactly tuned to a mood and to a level of physical grandeur in
performance that silences doubts about this view of Verona and Shakespeare.
Here is the secret of our belief in these arena evenings. For the most part
the central interpretations are minimised or defeated by the lack of a stage
frame, and at best we can respond to technical aspects of performance. I
find the men more interesting than the women this season, with the exception
of Elina Palshina and Inna Petrova, both of whom show poetic artistry as
well as physical skill - but one looks in vain for the ballerina glories of
earlier seasons, for any stimulation from differing temperament and style.
(I recall the miraculous variety between Ulanova, Plisetskaya, Struchkova,
Maximova and Bessmertnova on earlier visits.)
This week I have again admired the princely Andrey Uvarov, the blaze of
Nikolay Tsiskaridze's virtuosity (as Mercutio he enlarged and re-charged the
role in amazing split leaps and running capers; his death scene was
astonishing, not least because he somehow forced our attention upon the
beautiful arch of his insteps), and the finesse of Sergey Filin's dancing in
Swan Lake's ball-room. Yury Klevtsov, a fine, idealistic Danila in Stone
Flower, does not yet have the dynamic scale for Spartacus.
The season is unlike anything we have known before from the Bolshoy, or any
other company. It has shown that an audience can be inspired - through an
insistent advertising campaign, I'd hazard - to pay high prices for an arena
dance event, and that in the Bolshoy Ballet we have the one company in the
world that can sustain the demands of such surroundings, and such hype.
The choice of repertory for the event is astute. It is not what
Bolshoy-lovers, even ballet-lovers, want to see, since it cuts corners and
ultimately denies ballet as a theatre art to which Moscow's troupe has
brought an immense glamour. But this is not theatre - though it is ballet -
and the dire imperatives of the Russian economy and the no less dire
imperatives of Western costs indicate this formula as a way forward (a
temporary one, pray Heaven) for Russian ballet and Western impresarios. It
is ballet for a time of crisis. It is also a mutation. And no one - least of
all the Bolshoy's directorate - must forget what the Bolshoy Ballet has
meant in the past and will, pray Heaven again, mean in a happier future.
The Bolshoy Ballet continues at the Royal Albert Hall until February 14

FT  29 JAN 93 / Arts: Berlin art reunited / A collection torn apart and
bound together by politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The artist Max Beckmann once said: 'In my paintings I accuse God of
everything he has done wrong'. Beckmann is one of the stars of the Berlin
exhibition Art in Germany 1905-37, which at once celebrates the reuniting of
works from museums in the east and west of the city and documents the
extraordinary story of political evil and misunderstanding which from the
1930s to the 1980s destroyed, dispersed and kept divided one of the most
magnificent collections of modern art in Europe.
Nowhere is art more bound up with politics than in Berlin. In 1919 the Crown
Prince Palace gallery on Unter den Lindenbegan amassing a sensational
collection of modern German pictures, including those by Klee, Kirchner,
Kokoschka, Beckmann, Liebermann and Franz Marc. In 1936 the Nazis closed it,
confiscated the works and drove the artists into exile. Some paintings went
to Munich for the 'Degenerate Art' show - aimed at convincing the public of
'Bolshevik-Jewish' decadence by hanging the works badly on walls daubed with
racist graffiti - and were then sold at auction. Some were kept as
'internationally saleable goods' to be exchanged for foreign currency. Many
were burnt, a few hidden, some stacked into bunkers in Berlin or the
Thuringen mountains.
After the war, works stored in the east were often filched by the Red Army
and turned up later at the Hermitage in Leningrad; through the 1950s they
came back to east Berlin's National Gallery. Those in allied territory went
to an International Art Collecting Point in west Germany and gradually
returned to West Berlin's New National Gallery. The communists accused the
west of holding these illegally, and for decades communication between the
two national galleries, a few miles apart and each holding parts of the once
glorious collection, was forbidden. In the east, there was little money or
inclination to supplement the collection, while west Berlin could afford
plums on the international art market.
Only now do the two collections join up at the National Gallery in the
former east Berlin. This historic venture dovetails a show of some of the
best Expressionist and Neue Sachlichkeit paintings, plus details of their
anarchic provenances, with an exhibition in an enclave at the heart of the
gallery recording what was lost and how. Photos, letters, newspaper
headlines illustrate the frenzy and fury, the ideological importance,
attached to art by repressive regimes; sales figures show the Nazi's
throwaway attitude to modern German art - a Beckmann self-portrait, now at
Harvard, bought by the Crown Prince Palace for RM7,000 in 1928, was for
example sold to an American collector for RM150 in 1941.
Beyond history, the exhibition is of course a celebration of the most
vibrant and exciting period in German art, and the images here of the big
city and human isolation in it, the biting satire, the psychic bewilderment,
have a freshness and individuality which still thrill: the luminosity, the
sensuous ecstasy of Nolde; the nervous, angular mask-like figures in a
Kirchner cityscape; Dix's bloated grotesques from jazzband and cabaret.
The famous - Grosz's satire 'Pillars of Society', Beckmann's 'Death' - are
here trumpetted along with much that is unfamiliar, since paintings from
east Berlin were rarely lent to international exhibitions. The early
Expressionist Lesser Ury, little known outside Berlin, is represented with a
dreamy view, 'Nollendorfplatz by Night'. Among the most moving pictures are
two agonisingly sympathetic portraits of down-and-outs in Wedding, a poor
Berlin suburb, by Otto Nagel, one of the great German realists from the
1920s, whom the DDR favoured when much German art from this period was
decried as decadent.
Every work here tells a political and an individual story. Among the
Kokoschkas, for example, there is the famous portrait of Adolf Loos, and one
of Bessie Loos which vanished from a Berlin bunker in 1945, surfaced at New
York's Parke Bernet gallery in 1971, and was bought by west Berlin. New to
me were a portrait of Jewish businessman, Wilhelm Hirsch, whom Kokoschka
regarded as a typical client, socially insecure and therefore wanting the
status of a portrait, and a whirling cityscape from the 1920s of Berlin's
Pariser Platz. Both were snatched by the Red Army and returned to east
Berlin in 1958. Most personally significant is 'Man with Doll', a portrait
of the lifesize replica of Alma Mahler which Kokoschka made after their love
affair turned sour. It is a delight that paintings not hung under the same
roof since Hitler can now be seen together in a show which sensitively yet
unobtrusively records their historical significance.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Arts: This 'Set-Up' asks for music - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Someone was saying at the interval that the new show at the Gate would make
a very good musical. I think that's right. The Set-Up has been around in
several forms for half a century and is such a marvellous story that it
would be sad to believe that this new adaptation at the Gate is the last
word.
The piece is about professional boxing. It was originally published as a
play by Joseph Moncure March in 1929. March was a poet who studied his craft
under Robert Frost. Subsequently he became editor of the New Yorker. He was
also a Hollywood script-writer. The Set-Up took off as a movie starring
Robert Ryan in 1949, though the new script was written by someone else and
there were considerable changes to the plot.
For example, the original brave fighter who defies the odds in the ring was
white and was called Pansy Jones. Presumably that was because boxing in the
1920s was segregated and white-white conflicts were difficult enough without
adding the complexities of race. By the time of the movie Pansy Jones had
become black and his name was changed to Bill 'Stoker' Thompson, presumably
because in the late 1940s to have a black boxer with a sexually equivocal
name would have been altogether too much even for American liberals. One
thing at a time.
The basic story is about is about a fighter who comes from nowhere to win a
fight that he did not understand he was being paid to lose. He does it by a
mix of guts and skill. How the piece ends depends on whoever does the latest
adaptation.
The trouble with the version at the Gate is that it has become a one-man
show, adapted and performed by Kerry Shale, and written in rhymed couplets.
Much as one admires Shale's versatility and powers of endurance, one has to
say that it does not completely work.
The trouble with English rhymed couplets is that they are a very limited
verse form: they can restrict rather that expand freedom of expression.
After the first few minutes anyone with even half an ear can begin
predicting the rhymes. This is unfortunately true of the fight scenes where
the piece is meant to be at its most dramatic. Whenever the word 'yell'
comes up, you know automatically that the rhyme will be 'bell'.
What Shale has done is to try to construct a narrative ballad, but there is
another deterrent in the length. 'Eskimo Nell' may be a technically
excellent piece of versification, but I doubt if you would want to watch it
performed on stage by one man for a good two hours. It is to be briefly
listened to, not seen. That is what Shale has failed to realise in The
Set-Up.
At the Gate there is virtually nothing to look at, only a mirror slightly
cracked and a chair to sit in. The mirror is useful in that its reflexions
give you other views of Shale, but it never cracks from side to side. The
drama is lacking: however hard Shale tries - and there are times towards the
end when he can be quite spellbinding for several lines at a stretch - one
man is not enough.
Full marks to the Gate for professionalism despite its limited resources.
Early in the second act Shale understandably dried up. There came one of the
most efficient pieces of prompting I have seen from behind the audience. If
the prompter had been nodding, who knows what would have happened? Yet if
The Set-Up were a musical, no-one would even dream of nodding.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Arts: Nikolay Demidenko - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Demidenko's latest Wigmore Hall recitals are ambitiously devised. There are
six of them, one a month until June, under the umbrella title 'Piano
Masterworks'; their programmes (planned for the Russian pianist by Ates
Orga) cover a span of keyboard writing from Scarlatti to Gubaydulina, making
up a personalised 'History of the Piano' as traced by a grand virtuoso of
the instrument.
The young Russian pianist is evidently now a favourite of the London public:
on Wednesday, for the first concert of the series, the Wigmore was
jam-packed. He has virtuosity to spare. His fingers are astonishingly agile,
precise, muscularly clean. His range of dynamics, texture, touch and tone is
formidably wide. The programme, subtitled 'The Classicists', opened with a
group of Scarlatti sonatas and closed with Mozart's C minor Fantasia (K475)
followed by the sonata (K. 457) of the same key. While big pianistic
gestures may not have been in demand, speed, delicacy and crisp articulation
undoubtedly were, and Demidenko supplied them with easy mastery.
What he appears to lack in this music is charm, imaginative alertness,
sensitivity to melodic delight, idiomatic conviction. He evinced not a
smidgen of that buoyant pleasure in contrast expected from a Scarlatti group
when tackled by a front-rank pianist: the despatch was brisk, unsmiling. Two
of the works on offer were complex sets of variations - CPE Bach's on Les
Folies d'Espagne in the first half, Haydn's celebrated F minor piece in the
second. The gift of dramatisation that imbues the unfolding of these pieces
with ever-growing excitement seemed conspicuously absent; the Haydn was
taken so slowly that the sound of the music remained thoroughly ventilated,
the sense dispiritingly chilly and fugitive.
It was a similar story in the Clementi F sharp minor Sonata (once recorded,
with wonderful elan, by Horowitz) and the Mozart Fantasia. Demidenko's
characterising imagination seems largely asleep in this repertory. Because
he is a performer of such profuse gifts, one longs to give him -
metaphorically, at least - a jolly good prod.

Night owls will want to catch part two of Heimat (BBC 2, 11.20), the
remarkable German saga of small-town life which tonight has Hitler's rise to
power as its backdrop.
Friday night is meant to provide the kind of high-octane green fuel which
will take you on Saturday morning roaring into the garden, to dig and weed
and prune like a wild thing. The relative newcomer of the evening's
gardening fare is Gardens Without Borders (C4, 9.00). A minibus full of
gardeners and would-be gardeners tours France, led by an over-talkative
garden designer with questionable taste. Last week, passing through
Brittany, the pilgrims came to the manor-house and garden of a certain
Prince Peter Wolkonski. It was a place of such ravishing beauty that to see
it so fleetingly was something like a televisual experience of Le Grand
Meaulnes. But even the most perfect gardens can be marred by the combination
of a presenter's ego-mania, a garrulous and at times plain moronic
commentary, not to mention lamentably uninformative filming of the plants.
Thus far, the programme is a (French) dog's dinner.

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Farepak falls deeper into the red at Pounds
0.97m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Farepak, the USM-quoted Christmas food hamper and meat processing group,
reported an increased seasonal pre-tax loss of Pounds 965,000 for the six
months to October 31 1992 against Pounds 613,000 last time.
However, the group is confident of strong growth in the full year and is
increasing its interim dividend 13.8 per cent from 1.45p to 1.65p.
Turnover expanded to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 10.46m) and Farepak's agency
network - through which it sells its hampers - increased last year by 13 per
cent, to 55,000.
The average sale per agent was up by 5 per cent and the number of hampers
sold last Christmas was 800,000, an increase of 9 per cent over the previous
year.
Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 5.4m for the full
year, up from Pounds 4.8m last time.

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Control Securities nearly ready with
business plan
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROL Securities, the property, hotels, pubs and brewing group in
negotiations with its banks and creditors over refinancing, hopes to present
a plan to shareholders within 'the next few weeks' the annual meeting was
told yesterday.
Mr Sydney Robin, chairman, said the timing of the meeting - held in respect
of the year to March 31 - was not ideal but unavoidable. He said the group
was in 'what I hope are the last stages of long and difficult negotiations'
and he could not answer questions which might jeopardise the success of the
talks.
He said 'provided the final discussions go well, I will be calling another
meeting in the near future'. He also told shareholders that borrowings had
been reduced 'by quite a considerable amount' and the process was
continuing.
The meeting approved all the resolutions including one waiving the company's
borrowing limits. Mr Robin said that if the resolution was defeated the
group would have to cease trading.
Its shares have been suspended since October 1991, and it is hoped trading
will resume once a package has been put to shareholders.
The business plan will include asset sales and Mr Robin said: 'I continue to
believe that better values are available outside receivership'.
One shareholder, who worked for a Swiss investment group, asked about the
recent sale of the group's stake in Stylo at 90p a share. He said his firm
would have been interested in buying the shares and could have paid a higher
price.
The company is instituting an investigation after another investor asked
questions which revealed that he had ob-tained confidential information
about management and staff salaries.

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Unitech hit by low Japanese contribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP drop in the contribution from a Japanese business reduced interim
pre-tax profit at Unitech, the electronic components group, by 42 per cent
from Pounds 7.81m to Pounds 4.55m.
Unitech's main Japanese interest is its 50.6 stake in Nemic-Lambda, a power
supplies company floated on Tokyo's over-the-counter market in 1991.
Mr Peter Curry, group chairman, said Nemic's sales had dropped by 20 per
cent between the second and third quarters of last year and stayed at that
low level. As a result its pre-tax profit contribution had fallen from
Pounds 5.9m to Pounds 1.25m.
Overall, group turnover slipped to Pounds 117.2m (Pounds 131.1m) in the six
months to November 30, although the majority of the decline reflected
discontinued activities.
Operating profit in the continuing power supplies, connectors and control
products businesses fell 39 per cent to Pounds 6.46m. Nearly Pounds 1m less
was paid in interest charges, which totalled Pounds 1.99m.
The group is 55 per cent owned by two Swiss companies: Elektrowatt, an
industrial group which has two seats on Unitech's board, and Saurer Gruppe,
vehicle of the financier Mr Tito Tettamanti, which has no representation. In
1989, soon after the two came in, Unitech's share price rose to nearly 400p.
Yesterday it closed at 167p - up 2p.
Mr Curry, who founded the group in 1962, said that leaving aside Nemic,
profits had increased from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 3.3m.
The main areas of improvement were North America, which accounted for 30 per
cent of sales, and the UK and Germany.
In the US, economic recovery and increased exports had enhanced the figures.
In the UK, a range of power modules launched two years ago had proved a
success. Control products subsidiaries in these two countries had also done
well.
Mr Curry said the biggest second-half question was what improvement could be
achieved in Japan after some cost-cutting.
Net debt had increased by Pounds 18.9m to about Pounds 60m since the end of
last year, the bulk of which was accounted for by exchange rate movements.
Gearing of 57 per cent was, however, an improvement on the 77 per cent
prevailing in November 1991.
The interim dividend was held at 2.1p. Earnings per share, slipped to 3.4p
(4p).

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Stakis calls for Pounds 28m and sells its
nursing homes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAKIS emerged from conval-escence yesterday by selling its nursing homes
side for Pounds 50m cash and launching a Pounds 28m 1-for-3 rights issue. It
will now concentrate on hotels and casinos, where, it says, performance is
improving.
Stakis made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 305,000 in the year ended September
1992, compared with a loss of Pounds 47.4m of which Pounds 43.68m were
exceptionals.
The sale of the nursing homes and the rights issue will cut Stakis's debt
from Pounds 197m to below Pounds 120m and enable the company to pay off 12
of its lending banks and agree a two-year facility with the remaining nine,
replacing a standstill arrangement.
Sir Lewis Robertson, who came in as chairman in early 1991 when the problems
of the over-extended company became critical, said the company had made a
'substantial move towards normal banking relationships.' Stakis's future was
now, 'much more firmly assured with its senior direction fully settled.'
Ashbourne Homes, which operates 18 upmarket nursing homes, has been sold to
a syndicate led by the Electra Private Equity Partners fund, which raised
Pounds 486m in 1990 to invest in private equity. The fund includes the
quoted Electra Investment Trust. In addition to the Pounds 50m purchase
price the investors will provide a further Pounds 8m available to fund
development.
Along with Electra in supplying the Pounds 28m equity components of the deal
are Prudential Venture Managers, Causeway Capital and Schroder Ventures.
Senior debt comes from the Bank of Scotland, Midland Bank and 3i.
Mr David Symondson of Electra Kingsway, which arranged the deal, said it had
originally discussed a joint venture with Stakis. Ashbourne might eventually
be floated on the Stock Exchange.
Stakis decided to sell Ashbourne Homes, which made an operating profit of
Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 2m), because of the future burden of developing its 21
sites for new homes, as well as the high cost of maintaining the sites.
Mr David Michels, Stakis's chief executive, said that developing the sites
would have cost Stakis about Pounds 70m when it wanted to do other things.
Stakis is taking an extraordinary loss on the sale of Pounds 47.7m.
There was a recent improvement in casinos which earlier in the year suffered
from the effect on spending of recession. Operating profit was virtually
unchanged at Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 6.5m). Operating margins on the 30 hotels
had improved and the division made operating profits of Pounds 13.84m
(Pounds 7.15m).
Turnover from the continuing hotel and casino businesses was Pounds 124.1m
last year (Pounds 128.6m). Including discontinued businesses, group turnover
was Pounds 154.1m (Pounds 171.4m).
Sir Lewis has no intention of retiring as chairman and his contract runs
until next year. He could eventually be succeeded by Mr Richard
Cole-Hamilton, former chief executive of Clydesdale Bank, who joined the
board last month.
The rights issue involves one new share for every three existing held on
January 18 at 32p per share.
Stakis passed its interim dividend but is paying a final dividend of 0.45p
(0.9p). Earnings were 0.15p (losses 16.74p). Stakis shares rose 4p to 45p.

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: MFI shows 33% fall as sales slip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS OF a disappointing start to the post-Christmas sales at MFI Furniture
Group yesterday marred its first results to be announced since last July's
flotation.
Mr Derek Hunt, chairman and chief executive, gave a downbeat assessment of
current trading alongside the announcement of a 33 per cent fall in pro
forma pre-tax profit, from Pounds 19m to Pounds 12.7m, in the 28 weeks to
November 7.
'I'm disappointed with these results, but they should be viewed in the
context of hostile economic conditions, in particular in the housing
market,' he said.
Turnover slipped from Pounds 321.6m to Pounds 303.6m. Pro forma operating
profit was 20 per cent down at Pounds 19.4m, before a Pounds 1.9m charge for
closing some dealerships. The figures were at the bottom end of
expectations.
Profit forecasts for the year to April, which had been pushing Pounds 80m at
the time of flotation, were downgraded again yesterday to about Pounds 45m.
One analyst said this marked the difference between earlier hopes of a 5 per
cent rise in sales this year and the latest projection of a 5 per cent
decline.
Mr Hunt said turnover was down in the first five weeks of the 10-week sale
period, which accounted for about 30 per cent of the annual total. The
outcome was, however, being compared with a strong January sale last year.
He also pointed out that slower sales of the large-ticket kitchen and
bedroom furniture, which tended to be made in-house, meant that margins had
been depressed. Beds, upholstery and cheaper goods had shown some growth.
Like other retailers, MFI experienced an immediate drop in sales after the
mid-September sterling crisis.
The flotation enabled most of the Pounds 500m debt left over from the 1987
management buy-out to be repaid. Net debt stood at about Pounds 83m in
November for gearing of 78 per cent.
This greatly reduced interest payments. In the first half of last year they
amounted to Pounds 35.9m, the actual amount paid this time was Pounds 18.3m
and the pro forma figure - assuming the flotation had happened before the
period - was Pounds 5.4m.
Actual pre-tax loss was Pounds 12m. Interest costs, an Pounds 11m
flotation-related management bonus and Pounds 2.2m bank fees accounted for
the near Pounds 25m difference between the actual loss and pro forma profit.
Mr Hunt said that with no sign of recovery, the emphasis remained on
cost-cutting. The abandonment of regular Sunday opening and the shedding of
nearly 400 jobs would cut payroll costs. The group, which has 175 stores in
the UK, was also letting out surplus retail space and shrinking its
warehousing.
Progress had been made in France where the plan was to increase the number
of stores from 32 to 50.
MFI's share price shed 7p yesterday to close at 128p, compared with the
flotation price of 115p, when the market was much softer. Its present Pounds

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Sun Life shows fall in new business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sun Life, the life assurance company in which TransAtlantic Holdings has a
50 per cent stake, suffered a slight fall in new business last year.
Using the recognised yardstick of total regular premium business plus 10 per
cent of single premiums, volume declined from Pounds 228.2m to Pounds
227.7m.
Total annual premiums fell from Pounds 88m to Pounds 85.6m, but single
premiums rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 409.6m, and single premium life
business grew 5 per cent to Pounds 956.7m, mainly on the back of
single-premium unit-linked bond sales.
Income from the business expansion scheme more than halved, from Pounds
65.9m to Pounds 30.8m.

In its first full year since the merger of Gresham with Telecomputing,
Gresham Telecomputing, the USM-quoted software and computer broking group,
achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 767,000.
The result, for the year ended October 1992, compared with Pounds 355,000
for the combined results of Gresham Telecomputing for the previous 13 months
and of Gresham Computer Holdings and its subsidiaries for the 6 1/2 months
since acquisition.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 7.25m (Pounds 6.3m) and the pre-tax result was
after an exceptional Pounds 236,000 relating to the release of provisions
against licences purchased and the release of excess provisions for 1991
prior year adjustment.
Earnings were 1.94p (1p) and there is a proposed single final dividend of

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Misys sharply up at Pounds 6.76m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MISYS, the computer services group, yesterday reported sharply higher
interim profits, partly reflecting the performance of recent acquisitions
but underpinned by strong organic growth. The dividend is being raised by 15
per cent.
Pre-tax profits improved 88 per cent from Pounds 3.59m to Pounds 6.76m in
the six months to November 30. The increase included Pounds 1.53m of profits
from new acquisitions together with Pounds 209,000 (Pounds 120,000) of net
interest. Group turnover increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 41.1m (Pounds
32.3m), including Pounds 6.32m attributable to acquisitions.
Earnings per share grew by 70 per cent to 11.9p (7p), out of which an
increased dividend of 2.61p (2.27p) per share is being paid.
Mr Kevin Lomax, chairman, said that established businesses provided the
larger part of the earnings growth. 'Their stronger sales performance,
together with further reductions in working capital and overheads,
underpinned this advance.'
However, he also noted that the performance of the acquisitions made during
the last calendar year had been 'most encouraging,' with all contributing to
the earnings gain.
The financial services division, which now includes the Countrywide
businesses acquired in June, led the advance with record profits in all the
divisional companies.
Turnover increased to Pounds 9.24m (Pounds 6.17m) while profits on ordinary
activities before taxation grew to Pounds 4.03m (Pounds 1.62m). Mr Lomax
noted that Countrywide's contribution was 'significantly ahead of
expectations.'
Mr Lomax said the strong sales improvement in a number of the established
businesses resulted largely from increased market share and the impact of
new products.
COMMENT
Misys' results were slightly ahead of expectations, mainly because of the
particularly strong performance of the Countrywide purchases, and the shares
jumped 48p to 435p. But even if acquisitions are excluded, profits advanced
by 36 per cent. Meanwhile despite the Pounds 3.5m spent on acquisitions cash
balances improved again during the first half to Pounds 12.4m from Pounds
9.9m at the end of last year. Given that most of the gains so far have come
from increasing market share and new products, any more general upturn in
demand would boost profits considerably. But even without this Misys looks
on target to generate Pounds 16m of pre-tax profits and earnings of 28.6p.
On a prospective p/e of 15.2p this stock is still a buy.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY SITE Estates, a property company, yesterday announced that its pre-tax
losses had increased from Pounds 3.37m to Pounds 17.97m for the year ended
September 1992, which it described as 'the most difficult year in the
company's history'. The share price dropped from 24p to 13p.
The value of its property portfolio fell by 11 per cent to Pounds 113.8m,
particularly as a result of a decline in property values in London.
Property write-downs of Pounds 15.3m, together with a Pounds 3.02m write-off
of goodwill arising from the consolidation of Viking Property Group, led to
an Pounds 18.3m exceptional item.
Pre-tax profits before exceptional items stood at Pounds 353,000 compared
with a Pounds 1.6m loss the previous year.
The company is unable to pay preference dividends as a result of the effect
of this loss on its distributable reserves. It will apply to the Courts to
release the share premium account which will reduce the revenue reserve
deficit to Pounds 4.25m.
Losses per share worked through at 119p (23p).
Basic net assets per share fell from 122p to 9p and fully diluted from 174p
to 109p.

FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Airtours running out of steam - Owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS ABROAD, which is fighting a Pounds 221m hostile part paper bid from
Airtours, yesterday said its rival's tour operating business was running out
of steam and that its offer grossly undervalued the group's prospects.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, said shareholders should reject the
Airtours offer which represented an exit multiple of 11.7 times earnings per
share in the year to October, a 40 per cent discount to the FTA All Share
Index.
Launching its formal defence, Owners Abroad executives predicted Airtours
would lose money on its current airline fleet. Airtours already had the
wrong aircraft for charter airlines and would end up, after a merger, with a
fleet consisting of three different types that would be difficult to manage,
said Mr Errol Cossey, airline director.
Integrating Owners Abroad's tour operations with Airtours' would also be
difficult for a management that by then would be running a business with
sales of Pounds 1.6bn, four times larger than they were at the end of last
year.
The company would inevitably become vulnerable to an attack from Thomson,
the market leader. 'They (Thomson) would hit hard and immediately knowing
the (Airtours) management were all over the place,' said Mr Dermot Blasland,
head of Owners Abroad's tour operations.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said Owners Abroad's defence
'promises little more than jam tomorrow' and refuted the claims that his
business was running out of steam.
Mr Klein said the Airtours bid had all the hallmarks of an offer that had
been hastily pulled together after Owners Abroad announced in December a
tie-up with Thomas Cook and LTU, the German tour operator.
Airtours was paying a 'very large fee' to its advisers, Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, for a bid from a man (Mr Crossland) who owned a large stake in
Airtours. and 'clearly wants to be number one in the industry'.
If shareholders accepted the Airtours offer - only part of which is
available in cash - they would receive only diluted benefits from synergies
Airtours says will arise from a merger.

FT  29 JAN 93 / Aircraft makers fight recession: Cutbacks and falling
defence spending are transforming a depressed industry / Analysis of
worldwide reactions of suppliers and manufacturers to the downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, ANDREW BOLGER, CHARLES LEADBEATER and MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the past 12 months, Boeing has been discussing possible production cuts
with its huge range of suppliers and subcontractors. For them, this week's
news that Boeing will cut annual output by 40 per cent did not come as a
surprise.
That did not make it any more pleasant. Boeing's cuts came after similar
decisions by its two smaller competitors, McDonnell Douglas and the European
Airbus consortium.
The industry believes it is coming to the bottom of its worst cyclical
downturn since the second world war. But, unlike in previous cycles, there
are no signs of a rapid recovery. Excess capacity - put by some analysts at
around 10 per cent - and too many aircraft programmes are dragging down
profitability.
The big engine manufacturers have been hardest hit by the production cuts.
All three - Rolls-Royce, Pratt &amp; Whitney, and General Electric of the US -
are committed to costly long-term development programmes for new engines to
power the next generation of wide-body aircraft. Usually, it takes an engine
maker about five years longer to see a payback from a new project than it
does an airframe manufacturer.
For US parts manufacturers, the cuts in airliner production come on top of
the sharp decline in the US defence equipment budget. Companies suffering
range from manufacturers of airframe fasteners, such as Hi-Shear Industries,
to makers of sophisticated avionics systems, such as Honeywell, the controls
group.
For an example of the impact of the cuts, look at Northrop, the Los Angeles
based defence contractor best-known for manufacturing the B-2 bomber. It
makes the fuselage, doors and other small parts for the Boeing 747 and will
be hit by Boeing's decision to cut 747 production from five aircraft a month
to three next year.
Analysts believe Northrop's revenues on each jumbo jet total Dollars 10m
(Pounds 6.6m) to Dollars 15m, which means the company could lose Dollars
240m to Dollars 360m a year in sales from the cutback.
That is not large relative to Northrop's total group sales of some Dollars
5.7bn, but the company has been trying to establish a much larger presence
in the commercial aircraft market to offset declining defence industry
sales.
Despite the slowdown, and the likely cuts in jobs that it involves, Northrop
says it remains optimistic about the industry's long-term growth.
Overseas, other suppliers hit by the cutbacks say the same. Smiths
Industries of the UK puts avionics worth about Dollars 500,000 into each
Boeing 737, so the cut in production from the recent peak of 21 monthly to
10 will have a significant impact. However, the UK company said 60 per cent
of its avionics goes into the defence sector which, despite cuts, was
looking robust - particularly in the US.
TI Group, the specialist engineering group, says it factored in the present
downturn in demand when it took over the struggling aerospace engineer Dowty
in 1991 with a hostile bid. Dowty supplies undercarriages and activation
system to both Boeing and Airbus, and TI said it was confident that the
sector's long-term growth trend would be resumed.
Lucas Industries makes engine management and activation systems for Boeing
and power generators for Airbus. The Birmingham-based group said the latest
cuts would have a negligible effect, because it had already been taking a
very cautious view of demand.
It was the collapse in Lucas's aerospace profits last year which has made
the motor and aircraft components group appear vulnerable to a takeover. The
company most often cited as predator is BTR, the industrial conglomerate
which took over Hawker Siddeley at the end of 1991, after the UK group's
aerospace and other engineering businesses had all been hit hard by
recession.
In Japan, where the aerospace industry is small by international standards,
a string of companies which have become closely linked to Boeing in the past
few years will be affected.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which has about 30 per cent of the Japanese
aerospace industry's output, supplies parts for the rear body of the Boeing
767 and inboard flaps for the 747. Shipments of both will drop from five to
three a month from July, according to MHI.
But it will not have much of an impact on MHI as a whole. Aircraft account
for about a fifth of MHI's annual sales of Y20,500bn. (Pounds 109bn) Less
than 5 per cent of the company's sales go to Boeing, so at most its overall
sales will fall by about 1 per cent.
Kawasaki Heavy Industry, which supplies the forward fuselage and body panels
for the 767 as well as components for the 737 and 747, said the cuts would
have a big impact on its aerospace business.
Toray, the chemical company, which this summer will start producing carbon
fibre for Boeing from a US plant it is building, said it was well prepared
for the cuts. Toray has also diversified. Aerospace now accounts for just 30
per cent of its carbon fibre sales, 50 per cent of sales goes to sporting
goods such as tennis rackets and golf clubs.
For all the suppliers, the current downturn is helping bring about a shift
in the relationship with their customers. 'Within the next decade,' said Mr
Larry Clarkson, Boeing's vice president of planning and international
development, 'we will probably see a change in both the composition of the
airframe manufacturers and the types of relationships they have with
suppliers.'
The slump has forced aerospace prime contractors to cut back on suppliers.
'Until recently, in many cases we had two or more suppliers providing the
same component,' explained Mr Clarkson. 'The fact is, dual sourcing is very
expensive, and we have had to find ways to be more and more competitive.'
Alliances of every sort are proliferating. In France, Aerospatiale and
Thomson CSF have merged their avionics operations into a joint venture. And
in the UK, Dowty has been taken over by TI, Lucas is seen as a possible
takeover target, and Smiths Industries has been discussing collaboration
with Rockwell Collins of the US.
There are already only three large airframe makers and three engine makers;
in time, there is likely to be room for only three suppliers in each prime
component sector.

A British naval task force headed by the aircraft carrier Ark Royal arrived
in the Adriatic on Tuesday, a Royal Navy spokesman said yesterday, and was
now off the coast of the former Yugoslavia, Reuters reports.
The task force is also carrying reinforcements for the 2,400 British troops
helping to protect UN aid convoys in Bosnia.
France is also sending an eight-ship aircraft carrier battle group to the
Adriatic as support for some 5,000 French troops serving with UN
peacekeeping forces in the ex-Yugoslavia. The French force, headed by the
aircraft carrier Clemenceau, is expected in the Adriatic this weekend.
