FT  27 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Treatment of futures fund
advisers under review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's Securities &amp; Futures Authority is reviewing the treatment of
trading advisers to futures funds, following representations from futures
fund managers.
The issue will be discussed by the SFA's capital committee, which is made up
of market practitioners, on February 1, an official said.
However, the SFA is not expected to meet demands for a separate membership
category for trading advisers. According to an SFA official, this would not
be viable due to the small number of trading advisers supervised by the SFA.
Currently, they are treated in the same way as arranging brokers who have
some discretion over funds but do no handle clients' assets. Consequently,
they face more onerous requirements than advisory firms.
However, a reduction in the capital requirement for trading advisers is
being considered, based on the fact that they are not paid according to
transaction volume and do not have control over clients' funds.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Isuzu turns in pre-tax loss of
Y36bn for year

ISUZU, the Japanese vehicle manufacturer which is 37 per cent owned by
General Motors of the US, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Y35bn
(Dollars 282m) in the year to October, largely due to declining automobile
sales in Japan.
The financial pressures on Isuzu, which has made a loss for three years,
recently forced it to announce it was withdrawing from car manufacturing to
concentrate on vans and commercial vehicles.
It has formed an alliance with Honda of Japan, which will supply it with
cars, while Isuzu will supply Honda with recreational vehicles. Isuzu has
also formed important alliances with other automotive companies covering for
the joint supply of components.
Isuzu's pre-tax loss last year was down from the Y54bn in 1991. The
company's sales rose by 3.7 per cent to Y1,580bn. Overseas sales accounted
for 51 per cent of its turnover.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: NEC pulls out of fiercely
competitive VCR market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics group, has withdrawn from the manufacture of
VCRs in a move that highlights the increasingly harsh trading environment
faced by Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers.
The decision by NEC Home Electronics, NEC's wholly-owned subsidiary, to
retreat from VCR production comes as the demand in Japan for audio-visual
products has been particularly sluggish.
'We decided to withdraw from manufacturing VCRs as it is no longer
profitable due to the fierce competition,' an NEC representative said.
To keep up in the market it is necessary to include more and more functions
on machines while prices continue to fall due to the popularity of mass
market discount shops. 'I believe there are hardly any companies making
profits from VCRs,' the NEC representative said.
NEC will continue to supply VCRs manufactured by Sanyo on an original
equipment basis. However, it will not distribute to mass sales discount
stores where price erosion can occur. Instead, it will restrict distribution
to its 6,000 affiliated retailers throughout Japan.
The drop in the domestic market for VCRs is a growing headache for Japanese
consumer electronics manufacturers which are faced with a penetration rate
in Japan and the US of more than 80 per cent. VCR shipments in Japan have
fallen from a peak of 7.15m to an estimated 4.3m last year and are expected
to decline further to 7.2m in 1993.
While NEC does not play a leading role in the Japanese VCR market, with
between 5 and 6 per cent of market share according to the company, other
major manufacturers of VCRs such as JVC and Matsushita, have also been
forced by the fall in demand to cut back production. Last spring, JVC
reduced its VCR shipments by 20 per cent.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Private banks to open in
India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA is to have large, new domestic privately-owned banks, the first in 25
years, under the latest stage of its economic liberalisation programme.
The new banks will compete directly with state-owned institutions which
dominate the market and with foreign banks, which are active in many
commercial centres, including Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi.
Indian industrial groups are planning to launch banks in the next year or
two following the publication of guidelines last week for the entry of
private companies into banking.
The Reserve Bank of India published the rules after many months of debate
among bankers and officials. Supporters of the government's wide-ranging
economic reforms see banking deregulation as an integral part of the
programme, but senior executives of the powerful state-owned banks have
tried to delay the opening up of the industry.
Indian banking has been dominated by the state since 1969, when the
government nationalised 14 leading banks and encouraged them to expand,
taking banking into the villages. Banks were ordered to deploy 40 per cent
of their agricultural loans to small businesses. Foreign-owned banks escaped
nationalisation and new foreign banks were allowed into the country on
tightly-restricted terms.
The first company to establish a new bank is expected to be Housing
Development Finance Corporation, a fast-growing private sector mortgage
finance group. Other companies planning to enter the business include Tata
and S K Birla, two of India's largest industrial conglomerates.
Much to the chagrin of smaller-scale entrepreneurs, including Indians living
abroad, the reserve bank has set high minimum capital for new banks of Rs1bn
(Dollars 35m), a hurdle which would seem to rule out small banks. The new
institutions will be required to ensure their capital amounts to at least 8
per cent of assets. They will also - like existing state-owned banks - be
obliged to lend to farmers and small businesses, a requirement which could
prevent the new institutions from trying to cream off the most profitable
segments of the banking market.
The reserve bank will also have the right to determine how large the
founder-company's share of the bank's capital should be and how much of the
equity should be set aside for sale to other shareholders, including the
public. This rule will enable the central bank to keep close control of bank
ownership.
The long-awaited announcement of the private-sector bank rules meets one of
two conditions laid down by the World Bank for a Dollars 500m loan to India
for restructuring its financial markets. The other condition, yet to be met,
is that India should clean up the bad debts of the state-sector banks which
total some Rs170bn. Much of this has been lent to lossmaking state-owned
industrial companies.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Sumitomo Bank lowers profits
forecast by 84%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Bank yesterday reduced its pre-tax profits forecast by 84 per cent
and announced plans for the write-off of Y100bn (Dollars 795m) of exposure
to Itoman, a collapsed trading house.
Other large Japanese banks are expected to follow Sumitomo in announcing
large write-offs and appraisal losses on stocks to take advantage of strong
core earnings this year, which have been lifted by favourable margins
following a reduction in interest rates.
Sumitomo said that its expected revenue for the year ending March remained
unchanged at Y3,250bn, but the parent pre-tax profit forecast was cut to
Y25bn from Y160bn and the consolidated forecast was reduced to Y35bn from
Y180bn.
Apart from writing-off Y100bn of exposure to Total Resort Life, an Itoman
group company, the bank said that earnings would be hurt by the weakness of
the stock market, suggesting that it would report a large appraisal loss on
its stock portfolio.
The announcement came a day before the formal establishment of the
Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC), an industry body designed to
help clear the debris from the collapse of the asset bubble, which has left
banks with an increasing burden of non-performing, property-related loans.
From next Monday, the CCPC will buy the rights to the collateral of
non-performing loans.
This will allow banks to write-off their exposure more quickly and, in
theory, put a floor under falling property prices through the independent
assessment of the collateral.
Sumitomo has taken responsibility for dealing with Itoman, which is to be
absorbed on April 1 by Sumikin Bussan, a metals trader and another member of
the Sumitomo group.
As part of that plan, Sumitomo will write-off Y100bn this year, leaving it
with an estimated Y500bn in Itoman group loans, which a bank official said
would be reduced over the next five to six years.
The bank attempted to restructure Itoman, but conceded last year that the
trading house, implicated in art and stock scandals, was beyond help and
that its reputation had been permanently tarnished.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Latest chapter in catalogue of
revamps - The planned changes at US retailer Sears, Roebuck
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ED BRENNAN, chairman of Sears, Roebuck, was struggling to explain how the
retailing and financial services giant could overhaul its lossmaking
catalogue business. 'Trying to outline the catalogue strategy in three
simple sentences is tough,' he admitted wearily.
That was a year ago. This week, Sears' revised strategy could be summed up
in three words: catalogue is axed.
Over the next 12 months, the Chicago-based group will close down the
division on which the company's fortunes were founded, and snuff out a
product that for much of the 20th century has symbolised 'middle America'.
Even today, the Sears catalogue - a 1,600-page tome produced twice a year -
circulates to 14m households and produces annual sales of Dollars 3.3bn.
The decision will cost 3,400 full-time and 16,500 part-time jobs, and lead
to a Dollars 800m restructuring charge.
It will be accompanied by the closure of 113 smaller Sears department
stores; the disposal of 35 specialist fashion shops; and a host of detailed
moves designed to streamline other parts of the retail business.
In total, 52,000 jobs will go (16,000 full-time and 36,000 part-time); about
12 per cent of the group's revenue base will be shed; and a Dollars 1.7bn
charge incurred to fund the overhaul.
But, radical though these measures appear, a big question remains: can Sears
really become a competitive force in today's US retail environment, or has
the cost-base become so unwieldy, and its image so tired, that
increasingly-aggressive competitors have an unassailable advantage?
Sears' problems have been well-aired - not least by dissatisfied
shareholders, who have pushed for measures ranging from the demerger of the
financial services subsidiaries to annual election of all directors.
The common perception is that Sears is a US behemoth, which allowed its
number one position in the US retail sector to slip away in the 1980s.
Instead of focusing on the retail interests, critics claim, Sears
diversified into financial services. It added brokerage and mortgage
operations to its Allstate insurance business. With management's attention
diverted, core retail operations became bureaucratic and uncompetitive.
No one could accuse Sears of ignoring these attacks. Over the past five
years, it has announced numerous revamps and restructurings. Since the
beginning of 1991, for example, around 48,000 jobs have been shed (although,
prior to this week's announcement, Sears still employed 350,000).
A 'power-format' strategy has been fed into many of the 850-plus department
stores. This has involved dividing store space between seven distinct
merchandise areas - appliances, home furnishings, women's fashions and so on
 -and reorganising the group's unwieldy buyer system.
Even on the catalogue front, there were strenuous efforts to streamline
distribution and update sales techniques.
But by mid-1992, few signs of improved performance from the merchandise
division had emerged. Frustration resurfaced at the annual meeting in May,
and since then the pace of change has accelerated.
First, Sears added new board directors, including Mr Michael Miles, chairman
of Philip Morris. Then, in September, it announced it would divest much of
its financial services empire, a move still scheduled for mid-1993.
A month later, the company called in Mr Arthur Martinez, formerly finance
director at Saks Fifth Avenue, to run its retail operations. (Previously, Mr
Brennan had held this position, along with the roles of chairman and overall
chief executive for the group.)
There is no doubt that this week's announcement - the first major
development under the Martinez regime - represents the most significant
restructuring yet at Sears.
Shutting down the catalogue operation is an emotional wrench, but it also
staunches annual losses of around Dollars 135m to Dollars 175m. The stores
which are closing are among the least profitable in the group. Overall,
Sears claims these moves should add Dollars 300m annually to its bottom
line.
At least some shareholders are pleased. The powerful California Public
Employees Retirement System (Calpers), one of the most prominent critics in
the past, said the latest cuts appeared to signal 'a more focused approach,
and should give the group a more spritely image.'
That said, the numbers still need to be seen in perspective. In 1991, Sears
made a net profit of just Dollars 90m from its US merchandise operations, on
sales of Dollars 24.8bn. (Credit operations then earned Dollars 394m, taking
the merchandise group profit total to Dollars 486m.)
Some analysts question whether all the latest cost-savings will fall
directly to the bottom line; even if they do, the return on sales is
scarcely going to be stellar.
Moreover, given the emphasis in the US on 'value' shopping - led by the
discount store operators and the ultra low-cost warehouse clubs - it is
questionable whether Sears' cost base, albeit reduced, permits it to compete
effectively.
In 1991, for example, Sears' selling, general and administrative expenses
per dollar of sales was around 29 cents. At Wal-Mart and K mart, the two
biggest discount store operators, the figures were 15.2 cents and 21.2 cents
respectively. Although Sears offers back-up services, which inflate its
expenses base, and the mix of goods sold is different, even Mr Brennan
concedes the discrepancy is too wide.
Finally, analysts need convincing the 'new' Sears can post sustained sales
growth. Domestic same-store sales gains did improve last autumn, and in
December alone the company reported an 8.2 per cent advance.
However, pundits point out this was partly due to heavy promotional
activity, and the sale gains probably came at cost of some profits in the
Brand Central (electronics) and home-furnishings departments.
The gain, moreover, was merely in line with progress made by other big store
chains.
In short, Sears' latest restructuring is being interpreted as a necessary
step, rather than one which spells a rebirth.
'It will help them to perform better, to a minimally acceptable standard,'
says Ms Dorothy Lakner, at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 'But whether it fundamentally
improves their position longer-term remains to be seen'.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Windy City likely to absorb
jobless blow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE closure of the catalogue and the 50,000 new layoffs at Sears nationwide
is expected to cause barely a ripple in the economy of the Big Store's home
town, Chicago. 'It's kind of an irony,' said Ms Diane Swonk, regional
economist at First Chicago. 'If this had to happen it's better to have
happened in Chicago than in New York or Los Angeles.' Metropolitan Chicago
has weathered the recession better than those cities, she said. Other
retailers are entering the Chicago market and should absorb the estimated
4,500 area employees the restructuring will make jobless. The
Dayton-Hudson-owned discount chain, Target, plans to open stores, while
electronics retailer Best Buy and Texas-based Nordstroms are also expanding.

SHARES IN Northern Telecom surged yesterday after the Canadian
telecommunications equipment maker reported a surprisingly strong 24 per
cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings.
Fourth-quarter earnings climbed to USDollars 253m, or Dollars 1.02 a share,
from Dollars 204m, or 83 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2.54bn. Order backlog at the end of the
year was a record Dollars 3.9bn, up 19 per cent from December 1991.
For the year as a whole, earnings climbed to Dollars 548m, or Dollars 2.17,
from Dollars 515m, or Dollars 2.03. Revenues advanced to Dollars 8.41bn from
Dollars 8.18bn.
On the Toronto stock exchange yesterday, Nortel's shares jumped by CDollars
3 7/8 to CDollars 57 7/8 at the close.
Dr Paul Stern, chairman, said income from almost all product lines improved
last year. Slimmer margins in the highly competitive market for office
switches was offset by stronger volumes.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: BankAmerica shares rise sharply
on solid earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in BankAmerica rose sharply yesterday after the west coast banking
group announced solid fourth-quarter earnings and the sale of about Dollars
1.7bn in problem property loans previously owned by Security Pacific, the
California bank which merged with BankAmerica last year.
The bad loans will be sold to a new company being formed by Morgan Stanley
Real Estate Fund and the net after-tax impact of the sale, following
accounting adjustments, will reduce BankAmerica's assets by about Dollars
1bn.
The bank has, however, decided to buy a Dollars 100m stake in the new
company acquiring the loans. The investment, said Mr Raphael Soifer, banking
analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, was made 'presumably to
capture some upside potential in the assets'.
The disposal of the property loans helped reduce the value of problem assets
waiting to be sold - the bulk of them Security Pacific assets - from Dollars
5bn at the end of the previous quarter to Dollars 4.2bn.
Also, analysts said the transaction with Morgan Stanley probably means
BankAmerica will shelve its plans to set up a 'bad bank' - a separate
company that would have been created to hold the problem assets until they
were sold.
Investors welcomed the disposal of the loans and the fourth-quarter
earnings, bidding up BankAmerica stock to close at Dollars 53 1/2 on the New
York Stock Exchange, a net gain of Dollars 2 1/8 .
BankAmerica's profit of Dollars 473m during the October-December period,
which included a Dollars 61m non-recurring charge on merger-related
restructuring and other expenses, was virtually unchanged from the previous
quarter.
The figures were not comparable to the Dollars 285m earned in the same
quarter of 1991, a period before the merger with Security Pacific.
Total earnings for 1992 reached a record Dollars 1.49bn, against pre-merger
profits of Dollars 1.12bn in 1991.
Although the results were in line with market expectations, analysts said
investors were cheered by the news that the bank's intangible assets, most
of it goodwill from Security Pacific, had risen by only Dollars 296m in the
quarter.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Boeing declines 6% to Dollars
377m in fourth quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the US aircraft manufacturer which yesterday announced a sharp cut
in its production programme, also reported a 6 per cent drop in
fourth-quarter earnings, but a 4 per cent increase for 1992 as a whole.
The company's shares, which have fallen sharply this month because of its
deteriorating aircraft delivery outlook, closed down Dollars 1 3/8 at
Dollars 35 1/2 after yesterday's news.
Boeing reported net earnings before accounting changes of Dollars 377m, or
Dollars 1.11 a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with Dollars 403m, or
Dollars 1.17 a share, in the same period of 1991. Sales were Dollars 7.5bn,
against Dollars 7.8bn.
For 1992, it reported earnings of Dollars 1.635bn, or Dollars 4.81 a share,
compared with Dollars 1.567, or Dollars 4.56 a share, in 1991. Sales rose
from Dollars 29.3bn to Dollars 30.2bn.
Mr Frank Schrontz, the chairman, said it expected 1993 sales to drop to
around Dollars 26bn, with commercial aircraft deliveries dropping to about
340 units, against 441 in 1992.
Mr Schrontz said the increase in 1992 net earnings before an accounting
change was mainly attributable to increased commercial aircraft sales and an
improved operating performance, particularly in Boeing's space and defence
business.
The latter returned to profitability, with operating earnings of Dollars
204m on sales of Dollars 5.4bn.
However, these factors were partially offset by higher research and
development expense, particularly for the company's 777 airliner, lower
interest income and a higher tax rate.

MERCK, the world's biggest drugs company, yesterday provided further
evidence of the slowing momentum of earnings growth in the drugs sector by
posting a 17 per cent rise in underlying fourth-quarter earnings on the back
of a 12 per cent increase in sales.
Although the results were broadly in line with expectations, Wall Street was
disappointed. Annual earnings increased by 19 per cent in both 1991 and
1990, and by 24 per cent in 1989. Shares in Merck closed down Dollars 1 7/8
at Dollars 39 1/2
Fourth-quarter results were distorted by the adoption of new accounting
standards, which brought net income for the three months to Dollars 609.1m,
or 53 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 2.6bn. In the same period of 1991,
Merck earned 529.8m, or 46 cents, on sales of Dollars 2.31bn.
For the full year, Merck had net income of Dollars 1.98bn, or Dollars 1.72 a
share, 6 per cent below earnings of Dollars 2.12bn, or Dollars 1.83 cents,
posted in 1991.
Stripping out after-tax charges of Dollars 462.4m, or 40 cents, for the
adoption of new accounting standards, net income rose 17 per cent to Dollars
2.49bn, or Dollars 2.15 cents, in 1992. Sales were 12 per cent higher at
Dollars 9.66bn, against Dollars 8.6bn, with growth being lead by newer
products.
Some analysts have been disappointed by the performance of Proscar, Merck's
new drug to treat benign prostate enlargement, but Mr Arvind Desai, an
analyst at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said: 'We still expect Proscar to be a
Dollars 1bn drug, with 1993 sales of about Dollars 150m.'

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: UTC cuts deficit to Dollars 333m
in final period

<TEXT>
UNITED Technologies, which yesterday announced big job cuts at its Pratt &amp;
Whitney aero-engine business, also reported a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars
333m but said the full-year operating performances of all its businesses had
improved, with the exception of Pratt &amp; Whitney.
The fourth-quarter loss, the result of Dollars 701m of pre-tax charges,
worked through at Dollars 2.77 a share and compared with a loss of Dollars
1.22bn, or Dollars 10.33 a share, in the same period of 1991 when UTC took
restructuring and environmental charges totalling Dollars 1.53bn.
Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 5.755bn, against Dollars 5.808bn.
For 1992 as a whole, UTC reported a net loss of Dollars 287m, or Dollars
2.67 a share, after charges and accounting changes, compared with a loss of
Dollars 1.02bn, or Dollars 8.91 a share, for 1991.
Mr Robert Daniell, UTC's chairman, said Pratt &amp; Whitney's 1992 earnings
before charges and accounting changes declined to Dollars 320m from Dollars
502m the previous year, and Dollars 596m of the Dollars 701m fourth-quarter
charges applied to this business.
In the fourth quarter, excluding charges and accounting changes, Pratt &amp;
Whitney's operating income dropped to Dollars 28m from Dollars 138m, due to
lower commercial jet engine spare part sales and reduced engine shipments.
The flight systems business saw an increase in fourth-quarter operating
profit from Dollars 63m to Dollars 129m, thanks in part to an improved
operating performance at Sikorsky,the helicopter manufacturer.
Building systems saw operating income rise from Dollars 63m to Dollars 99m,
with air conditioning manufacturer Carrier enjoying a strong performance in
North America and Otis, the elevator business, achieving increased service
volume overseas.
The automotive components business had operating income of Dollars 29m,
against Dollars 23m.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: USX-US Steel blames imports for
Dollars 225m loss

<TEXT>
USX-US Steel, the Pittsburgh-based steel company, yesterday reported an
after-tax loss of Dollars 225m in the fourth quarter of 1992, up sharply
from the Dollars 165m deficit recorded in the same period of 1991.
It blamed a surge of steel imports during the final three months, although
legal, environmental, and other restructuring charges totalled Dollars 231m.
The fourth-quarter results bring the after-tax loss for the year, before the
effect of the accounting changes, to Dollars 271m. However, this still
contrasts favourably with a Dollars 507m deficit in 1991. Sales for the
fourth quarter were down from Dollars 1.3bn to Dollars 1.24bn, but for the
year overall, they rose from Dollars 4.86bn to Dollars 4.95bn.
After the accounting changes, USX-US Steel posted an after-tax deficit of
Dollars 1.61bn, compared with a Dollars 507m loss in 1991.
Mr Charles Corry, chairman of USX Corporation, the consolidated parent
company, said shipment volumes had improved in the final three months, but
that 'domestic market conditions were adversely affected by a surge of
imports in the fourth quarter.'
USX Corp reported a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 343m after-tax, compared
with a Dollars 394m deficit a year earlier, and reduced net deficit for the
year of Dollars 160m (Dollars 578m) before accounting changes. After this,
the net deficit widened to Dollars 1.83bn.

SHARES in Compaq Computer hit a 52-week high yesterday after the company
reported a 34 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net income on sales which
surged 63 per cent, writes Karen Zagor. Compaq shares climbed Dollars 1 3/4
to Dollars 56 5/8 at close of trading in New York.
Net income for the three months to end-December was Dollars 89.5m, or
Dollars 1.10 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.42bn, against net earnings of
Dollars 66.6m, or 77 cents, on sales of Dollars 873.4m a year earlier. For
the whole of 1992, Compaq's net income climbed 63 per cent to Dollars
213.2m, or Dollars 2.52, from Dollars 130.9m, or Dollars 1.49, in 1991.
Sales were Dollars 4.1bn, against Dollars 3.27bn.
*****
WARNER LAMBERT, the pharmaceuticals company, reported a 14 per cent increase
in underlying fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 137m, or Dollars 1.02
cents, from Dollars 121m, or 90 cents, a year ago. Sales rose to Dollars
1.47bn from Dollars 1.34bn, writes Karen Zagor. In the 1991 quarter, Warner
Lambert recorded an after-tax charge of Dollars 418m, or Dollars 3.11, which
led to a net loss of Dollars 297.1m, or Dollars 2.21.
For the whole of 1992, net income was Dollars 643.7m, or Dollars 4.78, on
sales of Dollars 5.6bn. In 1991, after-tax charges of Dollars 524m brought
net income down to Dollars 34.8m, or 26 cents, on sales of Dollars 5.06bn.
Excluding charges, Warner-Lambert said earnings rose 15 per cent in the
year.
*****
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES, the low-cost Dallas-based airline, returned
fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 27.1m after-tax, up from Dollars 8.84m in
the same period a year earlier, writes Nikki Tait.
For the whole of 1992, Southwest's net profits were Dollars 103.5m, against
Dollars 26.9m in 1991.
*****
THE EQUITABLE, the large but troubled US life insurance company, plans to
boost its capital 'substantially' by transferring its wholly-owned Equitable
Capital investment management subsidiary to Alliance Capital, a fund
management business in which it has a 55 per cent interest, writes Nikki
Tait.
In return, the Equitable will get 6.25m newly-issued units in Alliance,
valued at up to Dollars 250m, and will increase its ownership of Alliance to
around 65 per cent.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner to build multi-media
cable network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the US media group, yesterday announced plans to build in
Orlando, Florida, the most ambitious inter-active cable-based home
entertainment and communications network yet attempted in the US on a
commercial basis.
The company, which runs the second-largest cable television business in the
US, said it would eventually integrate this new operation, which it calls a
'full service network,' into its other cable markets across America.
The move is an important step in the gathering battle over which industry -
cable television or local telephone companies - will be the main conduit
providing multi-media services to the home.
Mr Gerald Levin, chairman of the group, said that the move 'clearly
establishes cable's technology as the primary pathway for information and
entertainment.'
Mr Joseph Collins, chairman of Time Warner Cable, said the full service
network being introduced in Orlando would allow consumers to call up movies
on demand, as well as interactive games and full-motion video shopping. It
would also give access to distance learning.
The company has also applied for an experimental licence to test personal
communications services - a kind of mobile telephone system, similar to
cellular telephony - in the Orlando area and also planned to offer customers
access to long-distance telephone service providers.
This is a direct threat to local telephone companies, which derive a large
proportion of their revenues from access charges to link local customers to
long-distance telecommunications groups.
Orlando is one of Time Warner's main cable television markets, with some
500,000 subscribers. The service will operate initially in an area with some
4,000 residential customers.
Mr Levin said the network would be in operation for demonstrations by the
end of 1993, and would start serving residential customers early next year.
The move draws on experience gained in a well-publicised experiment in the
Queens area of New York city over the past year, where Time Warner has been
delivering 150 television channels to customers.
Cable TV broadcasts into the home using coaxial cable, which until now has
been limited both by the the amount of information it can handle and
problems in delivering an individual service to customers. Time Warner said
it had overcome these problems by installing fibre-optic trunks to small
neighbourhoods of a few hundred homes, by advanced information switching
techniques, and by digital video compression technology.

COST-CUTTING measures and higher natural gas prices helped Chevron and Amoco
post better-than-expected fourth-quarter operating earnings.
Chevron, one of the biggest US oil and gas companies, saw the quarter's
earnings from operations soar to Dollars 542m, or Dollars 1.64 a share, from
Dollars 283m, or 81 cents, last time.
Reported net income was distorted by one-time gains of Dollars 546m in the
1992 quarter and charges of Dollars 244m in the 1991 quarter, bringing net
earnings to Dollars 1.09bn, or Dollars 3.30, in the latest quarter, against
Dollars 39m, or 11 cents, the previous year. Revenues rose to Dollars
11.39bn from Dollars 10.39bn.
For the full year, Chevron had net income of Dollars 1.57bn, or Dollars 4.63
a share, on revenues of Dollars 42.89bn, compared with earnings of Dollars
1.29bn, or Dollars 3.69, on revenues of Dollars 40.95bn in 1991. In 1992, it
took charges of Dollars 641m for accounting changes.
Amoco, the Chicago-based integrated petroleum company, recorded
fourth-quarter income of Dollars 548m, or Dollars 1.10 a share. A year
earlier it earned Dollars 153m, or 31 cents, including one-time charges of
Dollars 47m. Revenues rose slightly to Dollars 7.24bn from Dollars 7.18bn.
For the full year, Amoco suffered a net loss of Dollars 74m, or 15 cents.
Excluding new accounting standards, the company earned Dollars 850m, or
Dollars 1.71.
In 1991, Amoco reported profits of Dollars 1.48bn, or Dollars 2.98 a share.
Stripping out accounting changes, last year's earnings stood at Dollars
1.17bn, or Dollars 2.36.
Atlantic Richfield (Arco), the Los Angeles-based oil and gas company, turned
in fourth-quarter net income of 372m, or Dollars 2.30, compared with Dollars
268m, or Dollars 1.67, last year. In the latest quarter, one-time gains of
Dollars 75m were partially offset by environmental-related charges.
For the year, Arco earned Dollars 801m, or Dollars 4.96, compared with
Dollars 709m, or Dollars 4.39, in 1991.
Stripping out accounting changes and other items, full-year earnings rose 5
per cent to Dollars 1.05bn, or Dollars 6.52, from Dollars 1bn, or Dollars
6.21, in 1991.
Unocal had fourth-quarter earnings from operations of Dollars 91m, or 34
cents a share, up from Dollars 21m, or 9 cents, a year ago. One-time items
contributed to reported net earnings of Dollars 103m, or 39 cents, against a
net loss of Dollars 16m, or 7 cents, last time.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Northern Telecom up 24% to
Dollars 253m

<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Northern Telecom surged yesterday after the Canadian
telecommunications equipment maker reported a surprisingly strong 24 per
cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings.
Fourth-quarter earnings climbed to USDollars 253m, or Dollars 1.02 a share,
from Dollars 204m, or 83 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2.54bn. Order backlog at the end of the
year was a record Dollars 3.9bn, up 19 per cent from December 1991.
For the year as a whole, earnings climbed to Dollars 548m, or Dollars 2.17,
from Dollars 515m, or Dollars 2.03. Revenues advanced to Dollars 8.41bn from
Dollars 8.18bn.
On the Toronto stock exchange yesterday, Nortel's shares jumped by CDollars
3.38 to CDollars 57.38 (USDollars 44.88) before the close.
Dr Paul Stern, chairman, said income from almost all product lines improved
last year.
Slimmer margins in the highly competitive market for office switches was
offset by stronger volumes. The bottom line also benefited from a drop in
expenses to Dollars 1.56bn last year from Dollars 1.6bn.
Strong revenue growth in the US was due partly to the recovery of business
deferred earlier in the year, and partly to expanding market share,
especially at the expense of AT&amp;T.
The two companies won a joint USDollars 1bn order for digital switching
systems earlier this week from Pacific Bell.
Dr Stern said the order would double Nortel's market share with the San
Francisco-based utility.
Thanks largely to the 1991 takeover of Britain's STC, Nortel's revenues
outside North America have grown from 8 per cent to 25 per cent of total
business over the past four years.
Dr Stern predicted that proportion would rise further, but expressed
disappointment with business conditions in Europe, which he blamed mainly on
the overall economic slowdown.
In contrast to the lengthening list of North American technology companies
announcing lay-offs and other cutbacks, Nortel said its workforce had grown
by 2,000 in the past year to 58,500.

<TEXT>
SUPERCOMPUTER Systems, an ambitious US supercomputer venture launched five
years ago with plans to build the world's fastest computer, has closed its
doors after failing to raise funds to continue development work.
The company was founded by Mr Steven Chen, a supercomputer expert, when he
left Cray Research in 1987. International Business Machines has funded
Supercomputer Systems for the past five years, pouring Dollars 100m into the
enterprise.
However, IBM told SSI last month it would not continue funding the venture
beyond the five-year period to which it had originally agreed.
Mr Chen acknowledged his supercomputer development was behind schedule, but
said the company had recently completed a prototype and had plans to deliver
its first computer in October.
However, SSI's operations were closed on Monday and most of the company's
employees laid off. Mr Chen said: 'We were left with no alternative but to
terminate our project at this point.'
He added that he had been unable to find an investment banker willing to
raise money through a stock offering, and that a worldwide search for new
investors, to provide Dollars 60m needed to continue operations until the
end of 1993, had also failed.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: O&amp;Y debt restructure gains
approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York Developments is set to emerge from bankruptcy protection on
February 1 following approval of a CDollars 8.6bn (USDollars 6.71bn) debt
restructuring plan by the bulk of its creditors.
However, the revamped O&amp;Y will be a pale shadow of what was the world's
biggest property developer before it sought court protection last May.
The Reichmann family will remain O&amp;Y's sole shareholders. But they will
enjoy little economic benefit from their interest and will be stripped of
any real authority over the company.
Day-to-day control will pass to a court-appointed administrator, who is
expected to be Mr Robert Lowe, a partner in the Toronto office of auditors
Coopers &amp; Lybrand and one of Canada's leading insolvency experts. O&amp;Y
yesterday declined to confirm his appointment.
The main unsecured creditor group, with claims totalling CDollars 9.4bn,
voted in favour of O&amp;Y's proposals after an eight-hour meeting on Tuesday.
The claims include contingent liabilities related to the Canary Wharf
project in London, which has been under the care of an administrator since
May.
Of 35 lender groups which have voted over the past two weeks, 27 supported
O&amp;Y's plan, while eight rejected it. The eight dissenting groups are not
expected to oppose the Ontario court order which is still required to put
the plan into force.
However, the unsecured creditors, led by Citibank and Royal Bank of Canada,
failed to press their demand that O&amp;Y water down provisions of the plan
which grant sweeping releases to Reichmann family members from future claims
and litigation.
As one creditor lawyer noted, the lenders had to decide whether they were
giving away more in the releases than they were gaining in other provisions
of the plan.
Rejection by the unsecured group would probably have resulted in liquidation
of the company.
Mr Gerald Greenwald, O&amp;Y's president, said the restructuring provided
direction and stability for O&amp;Y's Canadian operations for the next five
years, and allowed time to complete a reorganisation of the US assets. The
US properties were not included in the court protection. Creditors are
likely to seize several buildings in the US and Canada. Income from
properties still nominally owned by O&amp;Y will be used to pay off the
company's lenders.
The main business of the revamped O&amp;Y will be property management, conducted
through a new operating entity, to be called O&amp;Y Properties (OYP). OYP has
secured contracts to manage several O&amp;Y buildings.
Several of the Reichmann's longest-serving executives will leave O&amp;Y over
the next few weeks. The new property-management arm is expected to be run
jointly by Mr Philip Reichmann, nephew of O&amp;Y founder Mr Paul Reichmann, and
by Mr Frank Hauer, Mr Reichmann's son-in-law.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Merck profit growth reflects
sector trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCK, the world's biggest drugs company, yesterday provided further
evidence of the slowing momentum of earnings growth in the drugs sector by
posting a 17 per cent rise in underlying fourth-quarter earnings on the back
of a 12 per cent increase in sales.
Although the results were broadly in line with expectations, Wall Street was
disappointed that Merck's earnings growth had fallen below 20 per cent
levels.
The company saw annual earnings increase by 19 per cent in both 1991 and
1990, and by 24 per cent in 1989. Shares in Merck lost Dollars 1 to Dollars
40 3/8 before the close yesterday.
Fourth-quarter results were distorted by the adoption of new accounting
standards, which brought net income for the three months to Dollars 609.1m,
or 53 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 2.6bn. In the same period of 1991,
Merck earned 529.8m, or 46 cents, on sales of Dollars 2.31bn.
For the full year, Merck had net income of Dollars 1.98bn, or Dollars 1.72 a
share, 6 per cent below earnings of Dollars 2.12bn, or Dollars 1.83 cents,
posted in 1991.
Stripping out after-tax charges of Dollars 462.4m, or 40 cents, for the
adoption of new accounting standards, net income rose 17 per cent to Dollars
2.49bn, or Dollars 2.15 cents, in 1992. Sales were 12 per cent higher at
Dollars 9.66bn, against Dollars 8.6bn.
Mr Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive, said strong unit volume, cost
controls, better product mix and a lower tax rate contributed to income
growth for the year.
Warner Lambert, another large pharmaceuticals company, unveiled a 14 per
cent increase in underlying fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 137m, or
Dollars 1.02 cents, from Dollars 121m, or 90 cents, a year ago. Sales rose
to Dollars 1.47bn from Dollars 1.34bn.
In the 1991 quarter, Warner Lambert recorded an after-tax charge of Dollars
418m, or Dollars 3.11, which led to a net loss of Dollars 297.1m, or Dollars
2.21.
For the whole of 1992, net income was Dollars 643.7m, or Dollars 4.78, on
sales of Dollars 5.6bn. In 1991, after-tax charges of Dollars 524m brought
net income down to Dollars 34.8m, or 26 cents, on sales of Dollars 5.06bn.
Excluding charges, Warner-Lambert said earnings rose 15 per cent in the
year.

<TEXT>
CATERPILLAR, the US heavy equipment manufacturer, suffered a 1992 year-end
loss of Dollars 190m, or Dollars 1.88 a share.
The loss, which excludes the effects of required accounting changes and had
been forecast by the company, was largely the result of unprofitable
operations in Brazil.
In 1991, the company recorded a loss of Dollars 404m, or Dollars 4 a share,
after taking Dollars 373m in non-recurring charges.
For the fourth quarter, Caterpillar reported a loss of Dollars 28m, or 28
cents, compared with a deficit of Dollars 318m, or Dollars 3.16, a year
earlier.
The fourth-quarter results exclude special accounting charges, but include a
Dollars 56m one-time gain from the sale of assets to its lift-truck joint
venture.
Sales for the year were Dollars 10bn, virtually unchanged from 1991.
Fourth-quarter sales were Dollars 2.6bn, up from Dollars 2.4bn a year ago.
The company said that while overall sales values were steady for the year,
sales volumes dropped about 4.5 per cent.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Compaq's stock surges on back of
profits rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Compaq Computer hit a 52-week high yesterday morning after the
company reported a 34 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net income on sales
which surged 63 per cent.
The results helped shares in Compaq climb Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 58 before
the close of trading in New York.
Net income for the three months to December 31 was Dollars 89.5m, or Dollars
1.10 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.42bn, against net earnings of Dollars
66.6m, or 77 cents, on sales of Dollars 873.4m a year earlier.
Analysts had expected Compaq to earn between 80 cents and Dollars 1.01 share
in the quarter.
Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, chief executive, said: 'We've seen record-setting
demand for our entire product line since June when we began implementing our
new strategy of offering price-leading products that feature Compaq quality
and the best service and support in the industry.'
Compaq said the number of PCs shipped in the fourth quarter more than
doubled from the previous year, but its backlog was continuing into the 1993
first quarter.
'To accelerate our product output, we've added production lines, parts
inventory and employee shifts in our Houston, Singapore and Scotland
factories during the third and fourth quarters,' Mr Pfeiffer said.
For the whole of 1992, Compaq's net income climbed 63 per cent to Dollars
213.2m, or Dollars 2.52, from Dollars 130.9m, or Dollars 1.49, in 1991.
Sales were Dollars 4.1bn, against Dollars 3.27bn.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Westminster council to reduce pensions of 600 ex-employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTMINSTER City Council is set to cut the pensions of 600 former employees,
giving them less than a month's notice, on the grounds that existing
payments are too generous under the law.
The pensioners will be deprived of an average of Pounds 750 a year, about 15
per cent of their pension. The only relief on offer is a welfare counselling
service.
One in six of Westminster's pensioners will be affected by the cuts, ranging
from former cleaning staff to senior council officers. They are virtually
all people made redundant at the age of 50 or above within the past five
years, mostly as a result of restructuring or competitive tendering of
services.
The cuts are expected to save the council's superannuation fund Pounds
450,000 a year.
On the basis of advice from leading QCs, Westminster believes that pensions
paid under the redundancy package it operated until last year are probably
too generous, because they exceed those prescribed by the 1972
Superannuation Act and subsequent regulations.
Westminster has already acted to curb the size of future lump sum and
pension payments. The decision to cut the pensions of those who left the
council before those changes will almost certainly be taken this Friday, at
a three-member sub-committee of Westminster's policy and resources
committee.
Letters will then be sent to those affected. No attempt will be made to claw
back sums already paid.
Mr Bill Roots, Westminster's finance director, said yesterday: 'This is an
awful business, but we have no choice in the matter. I have a clear duty to
follow legal advice that the current level of payments is unlawful.'
Westminster took advice after a Court of Appeal ruling in March 1992 that
North Tyneside council's voluntary severance scheme was unlawful because it
was more generous than that provided by government regulations. The level of
continuing pensions paid to those over 50 was not a direct issue, but may
have been affected.
The Audit Commission, the local government watchdog, has advised councils to
re-examine severance schemes. Swansea City Council last November reduced the
pensions of 110 former staff by an average of 10 per cent.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Climbdown inevitable over pits as MPs agree rescue plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPENSIVE government climbdown over the future of the coal industry
became inevitable last night after a cross-party committee of MPs agreed
plans which would safeguard at least half of the 31 pits threatened with
closure.
Ministers conceded that the proposals would form the benchmark for the white
paper on the industry promised by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, for early next month.
A report from the House of Commons trade and industry committee told the
government to increase the market for domestic coal in the generating
industry by a minimum of 16m tonnes a year at a cost of about Pounds 300m.
It suggested that a further 3m tonnes might be sold outside the electricity
industry.
Yesterday Mr Heseltine met senior cabinet colleagues to finalise a draft of
the white paper to be presented to Mr John Major, the prime minister, on his
return from India later this week. Any attempt by the government to propose
an overall market smaller than the minimum of 56m tonnes recommended by the
committee would invite a further damaging defeat in the House of Commons.
The MPs, who agreed the report after two days of wrangling between the
Labour and Tory groups on the committee, made no mention of the number of
pits which would be saved.
But privately they agreed that the plan would mean that 16 pits would be
assured of survival, with the future of three or four others in the balance.
The remainder might be kept open for a short period while they were stripped
of easily-accessible reserves.

FT  27 JAN 93 / SFO seeks to stop public hearings on Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office has asked a Commons select committee to halt public
hearings into the theft of funds from the Maxwell company pension schemes
because many of those to be called are material witnesses in forthcoming
trials.
Among those scheduled to testify were Lord Walker, Lord Rippon and Lord
Stevens as well as officials of Lehman Brothers International, Capel-Cure
Myers and Bank of America.
Mr Frank Field, chairman of the select committee on social security,
yesterday called off the scheduled questioning of Mr Basil Brookes, former
Maxwell Communication Corporation finance director, after receiving a letter
on Monday from the SFO.
The SFO said MPs were likely to question witnesses about matters that the
SFO itself was pursuing in criminal proceedings. So far, Maxwell's sons
Kevin and Ian, Mr Larry Trachtenberg and Mr Robert Bunn have been charged in
connection with the theft of more than Pounds 440m from the pension schemes.
Members of the committee are to meet the SFO tomorrow to discuss how to
proceed.
Some select committee members privately expressed frustration with the
request, but said they would have little choice but to co-operate.
Several suggested that the SFO was concerned about damage to its own
reputation if court proceedings failed to produce convictions.
'We had always said we did not wish our proceedings to prejudice court
proceedings,' Mr Field said. MPs fear that those charged in connection with
the theft may try to claim that adverse pre-trial publicity prevented a fair
hearing.
Mr Field said he hoped the committee would be able to continue hearing
evidence in public without prejudicing proceedings.
Mr David Shaw, a Conservative committee member, said if evidence had to be
taken in private, then a review should be held of the sub judice rules on
how what is said in parliament affects court proceedings.

FT  27 JAN 93 / French threaten action against UK on Hoover: Anger over
switch from Dijon to Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday threatened to take Britain to the European
Court over the decision by Hoover to close its vacuum cleaner plant near
Dijon and switch production to Scotland.
The British government has provided Pounds 2.5m in financial assistance to
help the Hoover move.
Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, agriculture minister and president of the regional
council in Burgundy, of which Dijon is the capital, said: 'We are going to
ask the Community to intervene in this affair.' He threatened action at the
European Court of Justice.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, was last night examining the
possibility of a formal complaint to the European Commission over alleged
misuse of EC regional aid by the British government, a French government
official said.
Mr Jean Auroux, parliamentary whip for the French ruling Socialist party,
urged consumers to boycott Hoover products if the group went ahead.
In Brussels, however, a spokesman for Mr Bruce Millan, the European
Commissioner for regional affairs, said Hoover, the US domestic appliance
maker, received no EC aid for its move. Cambuslang, near Glasgow, where
production is to be moved, was eligible only for EC small business
assistance, he said.
The Scottish Office said the state aid for Hoover was from a discretionary
grant scheme operated by the British government within the guidelines and
rules set by the European Commission. 'As always these guidelines have been
properly applied.'
The Scottish Office played an important role in Hoover's decision. Mr Ian
Lang, Scottish secretary, has been directly involved since the autumn in
secret negotiations with Hoover's US parent company Maytag on the transfer.
Mr Lang was pleased the Scottish Office had 'been able to help in financing
the project through regional selective assistance to secure it for
Scotland'.
Hoover announced the move from Dijon to Cambuslang on Monday, citing its
wish to curb production costs and group European production on one site.
Closure would lead to the loss of 600 jobs. Workers yesterday occupied the
Dijon plant in protest.
Hoover said it regretted it had to close production facilities at Dijon but
added it had made a commercial decision. Mr Bill Foust, Hoover's European
president, said manufacturing costs at Cambuslang were 25 per cent below
Dijon's.
The French outburst is a rare attempt at intervention in foreign investors'
affairs from an otherwise economically liberal-minded government. However,
public and private sector job losses have become an increasing concern for
Mr Beregovoy as unemployment nears 3m in the run-up to the March
parliamentary election which the Socialists are expected to lose
comprehensively.
Hoover's move has touched an especially raw nerve in that France is one of
the keenest proponents of the EC social chapter, designed to reduce
differences in labour conditions between community countries.
Britain's decision to opt out of the chapter has been one of many factors in
French disillusion with the Maastricht treaty.

FT  27 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Cost of capital
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems that companies seeking fresh equity finance this year will be
paying a very high price, at least according to the BZW equity-gilt study.
Using a model based on current and projected dividend flows, the study
calculates that the cost of equity capital reached a 30-year peak in 1991
and only fell back a little last year. This analysis confirms the widespread
view that dividend growth will be heavily constrained; the last time capital
cost so much was 1959 and real dividends fell for the next three years.
The implication is also that rights issues are currently an expensive form
of finance. Under the circumstances companies should try to retain as much
of their earnings as possible, rather than pay high dividends and seek
external funding. Those with strong cash inflows may be able to expand
faster than those relying on outside capital to gear up for economic
recovery. The current vogue for recovery stocks may be getting ahead of
itself.
As bank lending is also subdued, the bind on companies is tight and there
may even be a general shortage of risk capital. However, by relying on the
rapid dividend growth of the 1980s for expectations about the future, the
model may over-estimate the cost of raising equity. Besides, companies
feeling the pinch may not worry about the rate of dividends shareholders are
expecting in future. They may still come for rights issues - if they can
sell the underwriters a good story.

FT  27 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the celebrated arrival of the European market, investors should
perhaps be wary of companies with names prefixed by 'Euro'. First came
Eurotunnel, now Euro Disney - businesses with high-flown ambitions, grand
financing needs and unfathomable investment prospects.
Euro Disney's news yesterday of poor attendance figures and a FFr492m
first-quarter net loss was considerably worse than forecast. A profit is
unlikely until at least 1995. The cost-cutting programme and marketing
campaign may confound the worst sceptics, but even if successful, the
immediate benefits to ordinary shareholders are uncertain. Any uplift is
likely to be sapped by Walt Disney's management fees and royalties. This
could cause financing problems for phase two of the project, especially
since the stagnant French property market will prevent the easy realisation
of development profits. Shareholders who have seen their shares fall well
below the offer price are unlikely to stump up fresh funds. But, barring a
turnround, Walt Disney may have to forego some of its fees.

FT  27 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Wessex Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's rights issue from Wessex Water is a reminder that privatised
utilities are keen to broaden their horizons. As one of the tiddlers of the
water sector, Wessex has more reason than most to escape the yoke of its
regulated business. But the impulse is hardly unique; asking shareholders to
fund non-core expansion with risk capital is the kind of strategy that
pleases regulators. The market might reasonably wonder whether rights issues
from other utilities are on the way. With the sector still not far below its
high relative to the market - and the regulatory review of price limits due
in 1994 - Wessex is right to see a window of opportunity to raise fresh
equity. However buying into a growth business like waste management with the
lowly rating of a utility poses a risk. Even allowing for cost savings and
some cyclical recovery in land-fill prices, Wessex will have to work to
justify yesterday's acquisition price. Without the benefit of cheap
convertible funding put up by Waste Management International, the deal would
look uncomfortably dilutive.
With a relatively small core business and an ambitious partner in WMI,
Wessex has at least a fighting chance of establishing some credentials as a
growth stock. Its bigger rivals might be better advised to stick to debt.

FT  27 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Short cut to growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's decision to cut rates is a surprise only as regards its
timing. By acting yesterday it imposed large losses on gilt-edged
market-makers who were short ahead of tomorrow's auction. Its disregard for
a group whose co-operation is needed in sales of up to Pounds 1bn a week in
the coming financial year adds to the sense that the cut was a matter of
political urgency after last week's unemployment data. If the restoration of
growth is thereby confirmed as the top policy priority, the markets must
expect rates to fall further. The March budget may also pay only lip service
to fiscal rectitude and the need to reduce the PSBR.
Of course, higher growth would reduce the borrowing requirement over time.
But it has also looked for some time as though lower short-term rates - and
by implication a lower exchange rate which will eventually help attract
overseas money - will also be needed to help finance it. One task for the
authorities has thus been to engineer a steeper yield curve to encourage
investors to switch out of cash. Even after yesterday's rate cut the
difference between three month and 10 year money is still only 2.6
percentage points in the UK compared with 3.4 in the US.
Ultimately the shape of the curve will probably matter more to PSBR funding
than will any lingering offence felt by market-makers. Assuming that a
steeper curve is part of the strategy, the temptation to allow sales of
gilts to banks to count as PSBR funding becomes hard to resist. Banks have
been reluctant buyers of gilts so far, but would become less so as the curve
steepened. Even so, a specially-tailored instrument might be required. An
ultra-short, two year gilt would fit the bill. It would suit the banks - and
allow the authorities to argue that any relaxation of their funding rules
would be limited in time.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Elf investment cut as profits
tumble 36.7%

ELF AQUITAINE, the French oil group, is scaling back investment this year as
'policy of prudence,' after announcing a 36.7 per cent fall in net profit
last year to FFr6.2bn (Dollars 1.16bn) from FFr9.8bn in 1991.
Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, president, said capital expenditure would be cut
to between FFr26bn and FFr27bn this year from FFr29bn in 1992 and oil and
gas exploration outlays would be reduced to FFr4.2bn from FFr4.7bn over the
same period. But he stressed this would not hit any big projects.
'Whatever the economic cycle, we must do better than in 1992,' he said. 'I
have taken measures to ensure that.' Last year, the group generated a
cash-flow of FFr23.5bn, compared with FFr26.4bn in 1991.
The drop in net profits which Elf had clearly signalled last month, was the
result of 'a rare combination of unfortunate developments and sharp
deterioration of margins' in a number of sectors, the Elf president said.
In their belief in an imminent economic upturn, European refiners have
brought some plants back into operation and have halved their refining
margin to an average of less than Dollars 3 a barrel.
Petrochemical investments planned in the late 1980s came on stream last
year, while French farmers, in the uncertainties caused by EC farm reform
and the Gatt trade negotiations, by the end of 1992 had bought half the
amount of fertiliser they had purchased a year earlier. However, Elf's
speciality chemicals had done well, especially in the US, Mr Le
Floch-Prigent said.
He said he had built the group's 1993 budget around an assumed oil price of
FFr105 (Dollars 19) a barrel. But he would not exclude a drop to Dollars 13
to Dollars 14 a barrel, because Opec counties were over-producing.
The slowdown in investments reflected not only Elf's 'prudence' but also the
desires of some of its partners who were experiencing similar difficulties,
Mr Le Floch-Prigent said.

TALKS aimed at devising a long-awaited recovery plan for Daf, the
loss-making Dutch truck maker, ended inconclusively last night but efforts
were due to be resumed today, writes Ronald van de Krol in Eindhoven.
Daf was due to unveil a recovery programme yesterday afternoon but its plans
were thrown into disarray by hitches between the four parties involved -
Daf, its bankers, the Dutch state and Belgium's Flemish regional government.
The recovery plan is forecast to include fresh financing for the company.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz slaughters a
sacred cow - The car manufacturer's decision to adopt a new pricing policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, one of the world's most prestigious and tradition-laden
carmakers, has taken its time to wake up to the daunting dimensions of the
challenges it faces in the rapidly-changing world car market of the 1990s.
But the Mercedes juggernaut is finally rolling. It arrived publicly at the
starting line yesterday with an agenda for change which will astonish the
rest of the world car industry. With a breathtaking abandonment of its
traditional air of arrogance, the company set out a strategy for change
aimed at transforming its fortunes and position in the world car market by
the end of the decade.
The bearer of the dramatic tidings was Mr Helmut Werner, the 56-year-old
former tyre industry executive who takes over officially as Mercedes-Benz
chief executive on May 27 from the long-serving Mr Werner Niefer. He joined
Daimler-Benz in 1987 from Continental, the tyremaker.
Mr Werner, a potential candidate for the chairmanship of Daimler-Benz when
Mr Edzard Reuter retires in the mid-1990s, revealed that the new
Mercedes-Benz management team was now ready to challenge virtually all of
the most dearly-held tenets of one of the world's most exclusive carmakers.
There are to be no more sacred cows in Stuttgart. The company has accepted
that radical changes in the world car market mean that Mercedes-Benz will no
longer be able to demand premium prices for its products based on an image
of effortless superiority and a content of the ultimate in automotive
engineering.
With a disarming frankness - and a devastating attack on Mercedes-Benz's
most recent past - Mr Werner admitted that if the company were to continue
to 'over-engineer' its products it would be 'priced-out' of its markets. In
order to avoid this 'trap' the company has decided to turn on its head its
whole product development strategy.
Instead of developing the ultimate car and then charging a correspondingly
sky-high price as in the past, Mercedes-Benz is taking the dramatic and
radical step of moving to 'target pricing'. It will decide what the customer
is willing to pay in a particular product category - priced against its
competitors - it will add its profit margin and then the real work will
begin to cost every part and component to bring in the vehicle at the target
price.
Such an approach is not entirely new. Chrysler has begun to use it to great
effect to fuel its renaissance in the US, but at Mercedes-Benz this is the
stuff of revolution. At the same time Mercedes-Benz is aiming to transform
its range of product offerings by the end of the decade, changing from being
'a car manufacturer with a long tradition in the luxury class' to become an
'exclusive full-line manufacturer offering high quality vehicles in all
segments of the market.'
Mr Werner disclosed that Mercedes would add to its present three car ranges
during the 1990s with a small 'city car,' possibly with electric propulsion
as one variant, a 'people carrier' in the mode of the Renault Espace, and a
modern four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicle.
The people carrier, or multi-purpose vehicle, is closest to the market and
would be launched by late 1994 or early 1995, said Mr Werner. The vehicle,
code-named T0, will be built in Vitoria in Spain. The company is planning to
invest DM356m (Dollars 226m) in Spain, and the capacity of the plant will be
expanded from 28,000 vehicles a year at present to around 60,000.
The new vehicle will be produced in two variants, as a passenger-carrying
MPV and as a light commercial vehicle to replace the present MB-100 van.
Mercedes is thus joining the fight in what promises to become one of the
most fiercely contested segments of the European car market in the second
half of the 1990s. Fiat and Peugeot are developing a plant for a rival
vehicle in northern France, while Ford and Volkswagen are co-operating on a
similar vehicle to be built at a jointly-owned plant in Portugal.
Mr Werner said that Mercedes-Benz's new direction was being forced by a
conviction that 'radical changes in the structure of the car market had
necessitated the strategic reorientation of the company.' According to Mr
Werner, 'the traditional vertical market structure defined by engine size is
increasingly giving way to a horizontal market structure. 'Under the
influence of factors such as stricter traffic and environmental requirements
and a growing subjective component in vehicle use, the division of the
market into luxury class, medium class and small cars is becoming less and
less meaningful.'
With a proliferation of niche vehicles such as MPVs, off-road vehicles and
roadsters, it was body shapes and forms of propulsion that were becoming the
more important distinguishing features, rather than engine size and
performance. 'Mercedes-Benz has to gear itself to a future market structured
primarily around a diversity in vehicle concepts rather than around engine
prestige value,' he said.
As car buyers forsake the conspicuous consumption of the 1980s and place
more stress on a vehicle's functional use than on its role as a status
symbol, Mercedes is also beginning to investigate radical new ideas of 'car
ownership' and of selling cars.
By the late 1990s, Mr Werner suggested that personal car leasing programmes
could be available, where the customer might have available several
different vehicles during the year. The brave new world is not going to be
won without pain and dislocation, however.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney posts loss of
FFr492m in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, which has been plagued by problems since the opening of its
EuroDisneyland theme park outside Paris last spring, yesterday disclosed
that it made a net loss of FFr492m (Dollars 92.4m) in the first quarter of
the current financial year.
The results, announced little more than a week after the resignation of Mr
Robert Fitzpatrick as chairman, were worse than analysts expected and
confirmed fears that Euro Disney will make a sizeable loss this year. The
company's shares rose FFr2.70 to FFr67.20 yesterday.
Euro Disney had budgeted for a seasonal fall in attendance at EuroDisneyland
during the period from October to December. But the actual number of
visitors is believed to have been even lower than its original estimates,
despite a busy Christmas period.
The shortfall also affected revenue from merchandise sales and hotels, one
of which has been closed since the autumn. As a result, overall revenue
reached FFr944m during the quarter.
Although Euro Disney refuses to give specific figures, it has admitted that
the total number of visitors for the first year will be below its original
11m target. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley
in London, said the company would be 'hard pushed to reach 10m'.

FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Stora slips into red with
SKr1.4bn loss for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STORA, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, has announced a preliminary
loss of SKr1.4bn (Dollars 152m) for 1992. It is worse than expected and a
turnround from last year's SKr1.1bn profit.
Stora blamed excess capacity, lower prices for important products, a
slowdown in Europe and the weak dollar.
The group said an operating loss of SKr900m was aggravated by SKr800m in
extraordinary costs to cover restructuring. Offsetting this were SKr300m in
capital gains following the disposal of a power distribution unit and a
packaging company in Thailand.
Prices fell for most products in the paper and cartonboard sectors during
1992 although deliveries to European markets rose by 2 per cent.
The figures indicate the group made an operating loss of more than SKr500m
in the final four months, following the SKr380m loss in the first eight
months. Analysts believe the group may cut its dividend, which was SKr13 for
1991, when it announces 1992 figures in March.
Stora did not give a 1993 profit forecast, but indicated that conditions
remained difficult. The group is likely to return to the black following the
November devaluation of the Swedish krona. However, overcapacity, depressed
prices, and a downturn in Germany will offset much of the benefit. Analysts
expect a profit of SKr100m-SKr1bn for 1993.

NESTLE, the world's largest food group, said its consolidated sales grew 8
per cent in 1992 to SFr54.5bn (Dollars 37.78bn), broadly in line with a
forecast made in November.
The group said the increase in sales volume, excluding the impact of
acquisitions and disposals, was 3.3 per cent, compared with the 4 per cent
rise in the previous year.
The decline was mainly due to a combination of recession and price increases
in Brazil.
The sales figures include a substantial contribution from Source Perrier,
consolidated since July 1. Up to the end of October, Perrier added SFr800m
to sales.
The group will publish its profit and dividend proposal on March 24.

further fall in sales

<TEXT>
PORSCHE faces another bleak year of falling sales and profits, short-time
working and job cuts before it breaks even, possibly in 1993-94, Mr Wendelin
Wiedeking, the sports car maker's chief executive, said yesterday.
Losses in the first half of the current year, to January 31, are expected to
total about DM120m (Dollars 75.4m) on sales of just DM800m, he said.
Full-year results would be worse than in 1991-92, but he warned against
extrapolating from the interim figures since the sports car industry's
spring and summer peak sales season had yet to begin.
In 1991-92, Porsche lost DM66m on turnover down 13.5 per cent at DM2.7bn.
Some 80 per cent of the decline was incurred in Anglo-American markets, he
said.
Production this year would be cut by between 2,000 and 4,000 cars, he added.
The group will make a maximum of 17,000 vehicles, compared with 19,000 in
the year to end-July, 1992.
Production will be shut for a further 26 days by the end of July after 60
days' short-time in the first half.
Job cuts will reduce the workforce, which stood at 8,430 people at the end
of the last financial year to about 6,400 by December, 1993.
Models would focus on two lines: one in the DM70,000-DM80,000 range and one
in the upper price segment.

BOUYGUES, the French construction group, saw its net profits rise by 7 per
cent to FFr680m (Dollars 127.7m) in 1992 from FFr635m in 1991, according to
provisional figures published yesterday.
The company, which last month won a FFr530m contract in Hong Kong to build a
new football stadium and new headquarters for the Jockey Club, has not
allowed for possible provisions on its losses on the Channel tunnel project.
Bouygues, one of the largest construction contractors on the Channel tunnel,
has been in dispute with Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator, over payment for
its work on the project. In 1991, it made a provision of FFr123m for its
share of the losses on the scheme.
The group, like other construction companies, has been affected by the
sluggish state of the international building and property markets. Its
overall sales fell by 4.4 per cent from FFr64.3bn in 1991 to FFr61.5bn last
year.
Mr Martin Bouygues, chairman, has been rationalising the group in an attempt
to withstand the competitive state of the construction sector.

Berisford International, the commodities and property group in the process
of selling most of its businesses to repay debt, will receive Pounds 6.1m if
Albert Fisher's Pounds 29m agreed bid for Hunter Saphir, the fresh produce

When the cash from this sale, and others agreed but not yet completed, comes
in, Berisford will have no net debt. At its peak, Berisford's debts totalled
Pounds 1.2bn. The group is now looking for acquisitions.
The Hunter Saphir bid gives Berisford a Pounds 2.1m profit on the carrying

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Arthur Shaw to confront rebels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The embattled board of Arthur Shaw, the loss-making West Midlands building
materials group quoted on the USM, is due to set the date today for an
extraordinary meeting to consider rebel shareholders' calls for the removal
of Mr Gordon Pearson, the chairman.
The rebels, who claim the support of shareholders controlling 49 per cent of
the equity, want to replace Mr Pearson with Mr Ian Tickler, his predecessor,
whose family founded Shaw and which still controls a 13.4 per cent stake.
They also want to reappoint Mr Donald Crammond who was ousted from the board
last August.
Last week Mr Pearson, who controls a 15 per cent equity stake, obtained a
temporary High Court injunction preventing two former directors from being
re-appointed, or seeking re-appointment, to the board. This was lifted
yesterday pending a full hearing of the case next week.

Turnover expanded from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 9.13m.
The directors said the figure was better than they had budgeted for. However
they were cutting the interim dividend from 1.05p to 0.5p. Losses per share
widened to 6.01p (3.97p).
The second half traditionally compensated for a weaker first half. However,
sales during September, October and November were 'very disappointing' and
although the crucial Christmas period was 'considerably better', sales were
'below expectations'.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lister loss rises after exceptional
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LISTER &amp; CO, which manufactures a wide range of textile products, incurred
losses in the six months ended September 26. The deeper pre-tax deficit of
Pounds 1.62m, against Pounds 1.39m, included an exceptional debit of Pounds
747,000. Turnover for the period was up from Pounds 13.81m to Pounds 16.45m.
The exceptional charge consisted of redundancy costs and stock write-downs
incurred in a restructuring plan.
Mr Brian Smith, chairman, said despite continued recessionary trends in the
UK and export markets, sales in the yarn and woollen fabric businesses had
improved, although margins remained very competitive.
Losses per share deepened to 9.97p (8.52p).

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Workers from the New World uptight - Tate &amp;
Lyle faces a stormy AGM because of a dispute in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COULD Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle, which acquired AE Staley, the Illinois-based
corn syrup producer, for Dollars 1.48bn five years ago, face a stormy annual
meeting today in London? Some of its US workers are threatening just that.
They are representatives of Local (branch) 837 of the Allied Industrial
Workers, which counts 800 Staley employees - mainly process-workers,
technicians and mechanical operatives - at the Decatur plant among its
members. Last September, the union's three-year employment agreement with
the company expired, and management's proposed new contract is encountering
stiff opposition.
The fight is not, in itself, about money. The company is offering about 10
per cent, spread over three years, for the average employee, which squares
with labour demands.
What has distressed the union are Staley's demands for changes in working
practices - including the subcontracting of some work, a restructuring of
holiday rights, insurance concessions, 'flexibility' on assigning shifts,
erosion of union seniority rights, and changes to the grievance procedure.
Management says these concessions are needed to keep the plant competitive.
As with so many labour disputes, the contract battle seems to have exhumed
other festering concerns. Union officials, for example, claim that Staley
has fared increasingly badly in terms of safety standards and environmental
issues since Tate took over.
They point to one employee - a 44-year-old maintainence worker called James
Beals - who died after being overcome by toxic fumes while repairing a
processing tank, and to a Dollars 1.6m fine levied by the federal
Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration against Staley in 1991. Staley
replies that it has spent Dollars 10m on safety matters alone since 1990.
Another bone of contention is a pipeline, built recently, between the Staley
corn mills and those of Archer-Daniels-Midland, the big neighbouring
agribusiness which holds a 6 per cent stake in Tate.
The pipeline has never been used, but employees believe that starch slurry
could be shipped through this, making it easier for Staley to operate if it
faced a strike or lock-out. (Staley/Tate says the pipeline is designed to
transfer surplus slurry between the two companies and was not built with an
eye to a labour dispute.)
The present state of play is stalemate. Management and union last met in the
late-autumn, and nothing further is planned. Staley has imposed some aspects
of its proposed contract, although these would be adjusted for any final
contract. 'Collective bargaining never began - it was always dictatorial,'
says Dave Watts, president of the local, who is leading a delegation to
today's AGM in London.
But what makes the Staley dispute noteworthy is the strategy being adopted
by the union - typifying the way the wind is blowing in the organised labour
movement at present.
It is important to realise that Decatur, in terms of US geography, is a
near-neighbour of Peoria. Here, a bruising five-and-half-month strike at
Caterpillar, the earth-moving equipment company, collapsed last year when
management threatened to replace the strikers. With workers' resolve
apparently waning in face of this pressure, the powerful United Auto Workers
union called off the strike, and the company imposed its desired terms.
The Staley local, painfully aware of the Caterpillar strikers' humiliation,
made a conscious decision to tread more delicately. Realising that it is
neither large nor wealthy, it eschewed the strike weapon and, after
consulting various labour academics, has called in Ray Rogers, a New
York-based labour activist, to advise.
Mr Rogers, who operates from Greenwich Village, has a reputation for
applying hard-line, but less conventional, pressures. These may range from
an attack on a corporation's financial links - thus dragging banks and
insurance companies into a dispute - to spotlighting its environmental
practices.
Mr Rogers counts labour campaigns at JP Stevens, the textile company,
American Airlines and International Paper among his trophies. He is
currently working for the Newspaper Guild in its battle with Mort Zuckerman,
new owner of the New York Daily News.
His approach at Staley has been true to form. Local mail shots, for example,
have urged a public boycott of First of America Bank Corporation, a sizeable
Midwest bank, which has cross-directorships with both Staley and
Caterpillar.
This prompted Mr Robert Powers, Staley's chairman and a Tate director, to
resign from the bank's board earlier this month. Mr Rogers says he has only
begun. 'We will continue to go after First of America, but there will be
another target, a major financial target - a bank or insurance company - of
our own.'
Other leaflets and publicity materials have made much of the safety issues,
including Mr Beals' death, and a second line of attack is threatened, namely
consumer pressure. Here, the likely target would appear to be Tate's Domino
Sugar, which is a household name and is stocked on the shelves of any US
supermarket.
This business has labour problems of its own. Its New York City plant, a
prominent feature on the Brooklyn waterfront, has faced a 15-week-old strike
by the Longshoremen's union. Again, the dispute is principally over
work-rule concessions, and workers continue to strike after voting last
weekend against revised proposals. Tate, meanwhile, has been shipping sugar
into the north-east from Maryland and Louisiana instead.
And there are clearly attempts to step up the attack outside the US, both
through British unions, and, perhaps, investors in Tate. Mr Rogers claims
that a trawl is being done of pension fund shareholders with ethical
investment guidelines who might be susceptible to pressure.
Meanwhile, the Tate annual meeting looms large on the calendar. Mr Rogers
says that eight union members have shares and would be entitled to attend.
'We'll take the fight wherever necessary,' adds Dave Watts.
Whether any of this rattles Tate's cage, an ocean away from Decatur, is
another matter. But with its members still getting paid, local 873 thinks it
has a better chance than it would on the picket-lines, in the
post-Caterpillar world.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECCLESIASTICAL Insurance Office has determined the value of its offer for St
Andrew Trust, the investment trust specialising in smaller companies, writes
Philip Coggan.
The offer was based on 93 per cent of St Andrew's formula asset value. As of
January 22, this was 253.75p per share; accordingly the offer should be
worth 235.99p.
However, EIO has paid 237.65p for shares in the market and has extended this
offer (in cash) to all shareholders. The revised offer will be open until
February 8.
EIO has obtained over 50 per cent of St Andrew and does not wish to obtain
more than 75 per cent. Accordingly the insurance group is not seeking
further acceptances.

<TEXT>
CHARTERHOUSE Tilney, the stockbroker, is attempting to launch a new
investment trust which will specialise in smaller companies, writes Philip
Coggan.
The trust will concentrate on the smallest quoted stocks, the 1,000 or so
with market capitalisations of less than Pounds 30m. Smaller company shares
are widely expected to enjoy a revival after four successive years of
underperforming larger stocks.
Issue details have not been settled but the trust will have a fixed life and
warrants in an attempt to limit the perennial problem of investment trust
new issues - that the shares fall to a discount to net asset value.
The launch is expected to take the form of an offer for subscription in
February.
The chairman of the trust will be Sir Peter Michael, who also chairs Cray
Electronic Holdings. The fund manager is expected to be Rutherford Asset
Management.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Stainless steel newcomer enters UK market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVESTA SHEFFIELD, the Stockholm-based company formed in November from the
merger of Sweden's Avesta and the stainless steel interests of British
Steel, unveiled its new UK distribution company in Birmingham yesterday.
The launch of Avesta Sheffield Distribution was described by Mr Cliff Shore,
its managing director, as the most important event in the UK stainless
industry for decades.
The company will have about 35 per cent of the UK stainless steel
distribution market, and be responsible for distributing stainless steel
both from former British Steel plants in the UK and Avesta plants in Sweden.
The launch comes as European producers of both carbon and stainless steel
are implementing price increases. Along with carbon steel prices, stainless
prices in Europe have fallen by 30 per cent over the past two years.
Mr Shore said the company was raising prices for cold-rolled stainless by 10
per cent, spread through the first quarter of the year, and a similar amount
on hot-rolled. There would be a knock-on effect for tubular prices.
Mr Shore said he viewed the price increases with optimism. In contrast to
the carbon steel market, stainless steel sales had risen in volume terms -
annual volume growth in Europe was about 4 per cent and could reach 5 per
cent in the UK which has Europe's lowest per capita consumption of
stainless.
Yesterday's launch was aimed at informing some 200 customers about the
distribution company's business objectives and, said Mr Shore, to show them
who they would be talking to. Employment at the distribution company has
been reduced from about 600 at British Steel and Avesta before the merger to
400 and distribution reorganised and centralised.
Avesta Sheffield Distribution will have annual turnover of Pounds 120m, but
total UK turnover for Avesta Sheffield itself will be Pounds 240m, including
mill sales direct to customers and to independent distributors.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: FT-SE may reach 7,000 by end of decade says
BZW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FT-SE 100 index could reach the 7,000 level by the end of the decade,
said Mr Michael Hughes, managing director of BZW Economics &amp; Strategy,
yesterday.
At the launch of the BZW Equity-Gilt Study, Mr Hughes said he expected
equities to continue to outperform gilts and cash over the next few years.
However, the gap between returns would narrow.
BZW's long-term data shows gross real returns from equities of 7.3 per cent
per annum, from gilts of 1.16 per cent per annum and from treasury bills of
1.04 per cent per annum. Over the next few years, BZW is looking towards
real returns of about 6.5 per cent on equities and 3.5 per cent on gilts.
This narrowing of the gap will be caused, says BZW, by lower real dividend
growth and by lower rates of inflation than occurred in the 1970s and 1980s.
The research shows that 6 per cent is a pivotal figure for inflation. When
inflation is below that level equity prices outperform house prices; above
that level the reverse is the case.
The BZW study is of little comfort for a government trying to fund a large
budget deficit through gilt sales. The firm constructed a series of optimal
portfolios for investors, from those who wished for minimum risk to those
seeking the maximum return.
At the cautious end, almost all the portfolio should be in cash, with just
2.4 per cent in gilts.
At the high-risk return, 100 per cent should be in equities. Gilts did not
figure in any of the medium-risk portfolios.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Murray Smaller Trust raises net asset value
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MURRAY Smaller Markets Trust, the Glasgow-based investment trust
specialising in the world's less accessible stock markets, improved net
asset value per share by 11.6 per cent to 302.7p, against 271.2p over the
year to November 30.
Net revenue for the six month period fell to Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 1.34m) for
earnings of 2.29p (2.39p). The interim dividend is raised from 1.25p to
1.35p.
Mr David Briggs, a director of Murray Johnstone, the trust's management arm,
said many markets in which the trust was invested fell sharply in local
terms in the period. The exception was Malaysia which increased by 17 per
cent.
In contrast, the FT-A world index rose nearly 17 per cent because of the
strong performance in sterling terms of the US and Japanese markets, to
which the trust was minimally exposed.
The trust had taken profits in Malaysia, but was 'comfortable' with its
heavy Far East weighting. Since November there had been recoveries on the
Honk Kong, Mexican, and Argentinian markets.

John Kelly, Powell Duffryn's wholly-owned Belfast-based coal and oil
distribution subsidiary, has been merged with Lanes Group, the Northern
Ireland fuel distributor which is owned by Tedcastle McCormick.
Powell received Pounds 5m cash for the equalisation of the net asset values
of the two businesses and repayment of intercompany debt.
It owns 50 per cent of the enlarged activity.
In the year to March 31 1992 Kelly made trading profits of Pounds 2m and had
net assets with a book value of Pounds 4m net of intercompany debt.
The impact of the transaction is neutral to Powell Duffryn in balance sheet
terms.
Powell has also disposed of its 50 per cent interest in Aquapore Moisture

consideration of Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.9m).

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Reduced interest charge lifts Dale 9%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER interest charges helped Dale Electric International, the power and
lighting group, lift interim pre-tax profits by 9 per cent to Pounds
544,000.
Mr Iain Dale, chairman, said the Yorkshire-based company had made progress
on reducing debt during the first half.
Gearing had fallen from 110 per cent at the year-end to 100 per cent, and
was expected to fall substantially following the sale of four overseas
businesses due for completion in April.
The sale of five businesses in Nigeria and France were part of Dale's effort
to refocus on power generation.
Interest charges benefited from the steady decline in UK base rates, falling
from Pounds 962,000 to Pounds 918,000.
Operating profits for the six months to November 1 were static at Pounds
1.46m on sales 29 per cent ahead at Pounds 30.9m.
That was partly because of the inflated value of sterling before September.
Dale's export prices had been on average about 20 per cent higher than the
previous year, said Mr Dale.
That resulted in a sharp decline in the group's order book at the half-way
stage from Pounds 31m to Pounds 22m.
'We are only now starting to rebuild the order book again,' Mr Dale said.
However, he added:
'With the hole created by the over-valued pound in the first half, we will
be short of some business in the second half.'
Next year would be more encouraging, Mr Dale said. After an 'awful first
half' the aerospace ground power division was beginning to show signs of
life.
Mr Dale said the restructuring begun in October had resulted in the loss of
12 per cent of the 680-strong workforce.
The interim dividend is being maintained at 2p - last year's total was 5.1p
 -while earnings improved from 2.79p to 3.02p.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reckitt &amp; Colman, the food, pharmaceuticals and personal hygiene group, is
buying the Mantovani division of the Star foods company in Italy, writes
Haig Simonian.
Mantovani, a well known brand in Italy, comprises the bulk of Star's soaps
and personal care products activities, with annual sales of about L50bn
(Pounds 22m).
No price for the transaction has been disclosed.
The deal will raise Reckitt's sales in Italy, which stand at L100bn at
present, by about 50 per cent. It will also give it its first manufacturing
presence in the country.
Star, which is 55 per cent owned by the Italian Fossati family, has been
moving back to its core food activities.
The other shareholders are BSN, the French foods group, and Ifil, the
Agnelli family's quoted investment vehicle. Group sales amounted to L708bn
last year with net earnings of L29.3bn.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo to re-enter OTC sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday confirmed its
intention to re-enter the over the counter (OTC) non-prescription drugs
market.
The group announced that Mr Arthur Pappas, an existing board director, would
take responsibility for OTC products. His task, according to the company,
would be to develop and implement an OTC strategy for the existing product
portfolio.
All possible methods of achieving this would be reviewed, said Glaxo.
According to analysts, this might include creating, manufacturing and
marketing OTC products from scratch, making an acquisition, or securing a
series of co-development and co-marketing alliances.
During the past week both the UK and US analysts have been worried that
Glaxo might dilute its earnings by acquiring Warner-Lambert, the US' fourth
largest OTC group. Glaxo's shares fell 13p yesterday to 682p in a sharply
rising market.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Budgens hits Pounds 3m despite competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUDGENS, the small food retailing chain, maintained its recovery in
profitability in the opening half year in spite of what it described as
'unprecedented competitive action' by the leading supermarket groups.
The chain, where institutional investors installed new management in 1991,
increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.24m to Pounds 3.07m in the six
months to November 8, although turnover slipped slightly to Pounds 154.2m
(Pounds 156.6m).
Mr John von Spreckelsen, chief executive, said that last year the big
supermarket chains such as Sainsbury, Tesco and Waitrose opened stores with
an area of 800,000 sq ft in the vicinity of Budgens' outlets, which have a
total area of 600,000 sq ft.
He added: 'To hold turnover in the face of such competition indicates the
improvements we have made to our stores to enhance customer loyalty, and
augers well for the future.'
Although the number of people using Budgens' stores increased slightly, the
group suffered from a lower spend by individual customers, especially during
August, September and October, together with a severe deflation in produce
prices.
Mr von Spreckelsen said that although it had been impossible to increase
prices in the difficult trading environment, the group had increased
operating margins from 2.08 per cent to 2.72 per cent.
In line with other food retailers, Christmas trading started slowly but
improved right through to Christmas Eve, although Budgens is traditionally
less affected by Christmas trade than its larger rivals.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 250,000, compared with a gain of Pounds
842,000 last time, covered the costs of closing four stores in poor
locations. The group, which has just under 100 stores, opened three new
stores during the half-year and a further two have come on stream since
then. Two more openings will take place in central London before the
year-end.
Earnings per share were 1.45p (1.46p). The interim dividend was passed
again, but the board said it was confident that it would be able to resume
dividend payments again with the full-year results.
Positive cashflow, control of working capital and the proceeds from 1991's
Pounds 21.7m placing helped reduce interest payment from Pounds 1.9m to
Pounds 838,000.
COMMENT
Mr von Spreckelsen's new management team continues to make sensible
progress, but the degree of competition it faces is starkly illustrated by
the amount of competing space other supermarkets have opened in the past
year. The group has gained from improved buying power, distribution and
local pricing policies, but analysts wonder how much more benefits there are
to come. There was some disappointment that an interim dividend was not
paid, but that again seems to reflect justifiable caution about the trading
outlook. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 6.7m put the shares, down 1p
at 46p, on a prospective multiple of 14.4, a slight discount to the sector.
The shares have risen nearly 50 per cent since August, and seem high enough
 -particularly given long-term doubts about whether there really is a place
in the high street for Budgens.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Refinancing for Cranbrook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERCHANT Navy Officers' Pension Fund will take control of Cranbrook
Electronic Holdings, the USM-traded distributor of electronic components,
under refinancing proposals put forward by the board, writes Paul Taylor.
The proposals require shareholders to write off most of their equity
investments. The share quote would also be cancelled.
Following the refinancing, which would include the injection of more than
Pounds 1m of new equity capital, the pension fund will own 103.8m new
shares, or 99.3 per cent of Cranbrook's new equity. Existing other
shareholders will end up with the balance.
The package was made necessary by Cranbrook's deteriorating financial
position which was blamed on 'extremely difficult trading conditions'.
A move to call in a receiver was forestalled by the pension fund agreeing to
provide Cranbrook with a total of Pounds 150,000 in secured loans.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: US recovery boosts Domino
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG recovery in the US helped Domino Printing Sciences, the
Cambridgeshire-based European market leader in continuous ink-jet printing,
to push profits before tax up 32 per cent in a slowing market.
Interest income totalling Pounds 1.81m also helped boost pre-tax profits to
Pounds 11.94m against Pounds 9.03m last year.
Mr Howard Whitesmith, the managing director, said that if the interest
stream - derived from cash accumulated through a rights issue in 1991 - were
stripped out together with a first year operating loss of Pounds 492,000 on
the company's new PackTrack operations, the growth of the core business was
broadly equivalent to that of the previous year.
Sales grew 19 per cent, from Pounds 60.37m to Pounds 71.61m, while operating
profits increased by 12 per cent from Pounds 9.07m to Pounds 10.13m.
Earnings per share were up 8.4 per cent at 30.02p (27.69p) and a final
dividend of 4.8p makes a total of 7.2p, a 15 per cent advance on the 6.25p
paid for 1991.
The share price closed at 506p, up 35p. Domino is one of a small group of
principally UK-based companies which have benefited from worldwide
legislation obliging manufacturers to stamp sell-by dates or lot numbers on
foods, pharmaceuticals and beverages.
Mr Gerald Dennis, Domino chairman, said he was pleased by progress in the
US. 'Strengthened management and an expanded sales force have enabled us to
increase our market share in a sluggish economy. In Europe, following a
strong previous year, growth has moderated, reflecting the more serious
economic circumstances.'
The company has diversified from commercial ink-jet printers into the
PackTrack mimeographic printing technology, and 17 of these printers were
installed in the first year of operation.
So far, Mr Dennis said, no acquisition opportunities had presented
themselves.
COMMENT
Domino continues to dominate the UK and European market for commercial
ink-jet printers although its young rival Linx is taking some sales. In
Europe, the French competition Imaje is seeking a financially sound partner
and is, at present, a reduced threat. Domino's recovery in the US where
sales have risen from Pounds 12.5m last year to Pounds 17.6m is particularly
encouraging and suggests the company could take further market share from
its principal competitor Videojet. Analysts are suggesting Pounds 13.25m
before tax giving 33p of earnings and a prospective p/e of 15.3. It looks a
sound bet.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Shaw to confront rebels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EMBATTLED board of Arthur Shaw, the loss-making West Midlands building
materials group quoted on the USM, is due to set the date today for an
extraordinary meeting to consider rebel shareholders' calls for the removal
of Mr Gordon Pearson, the chairman.
The rebels, who claim the support of shareholders controlling 49 per cent of
the equity, want to replace Mr Pearson with Mr Ian Tickler, his predecessor,
whose family founded Shaw and which still controls a 13.4 per cent stake.
They also want to reappoint Mr Donald Crammond who was ousted from the board
last August.
Last week Mr Pearson, who controls a 15 per cent equity stake, obtained a
temporary High Court injunction preventing two former directors from being
re-appointed, or seeking re-appointment, to the board. This was lifted
yesterday pending a full hearing of the case next week.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Shandwick slightly above expectations with
Pounds 2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHANDWICK, the public relations agency, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
2m, slightly better than anticipated, for the 12 months to October 31,
against a loss of Pounds 1.4m for the previous 15 months.
Turnover was Pounds 157m (Pounds 198m) for operating profits of Pounds 11.9m
(Pounds 14.4m) before exceptional costs of Pounds 3.85m, of which Pounds
3.1m related to refinancing and Pounds 750,000 to the employee share
ownership plan. There was also an extraordinary charge of Pounds 4.5m
covering the sale of three non-core businesses.
At October 31, net debt was Pounds 62.1m, in line with expectations. Last
December Shandwick's bankers agreed to extend facilities of Pounds 69m until
the end of January 1994.
Shandwick grew rapidly through acquisitions in the 1980s. Last year it made
acquisition-related payments of Pounds 8.8m and estimated that further
payments totalling Pounds 15.2m would be made over the next four years with
Pounds 5.9m falling due this year.
Mr Peter Gummer, chairman and chief executive, said last year had been very
difficult but some 'encouraging signs in major markets served by the group
give us increased confidence in the current year.'
Operating margins of the US companies, where Shandwick generates 53 per cent
of its business, were above 20 per cent.
Earnings per share were 0.7p (8.9p losses). No final dividend will be paid.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Refinancing would take Cranbrook private
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERCHANT Navy Officers' Pension Fund will take control of Cranbrook
Electronic Holdings, the USM-traded distributor of electronic components,
under emergency refinancing proposals put forward by the board yesterday.
The proposals require shareholders, including several institutions, to write
off their equity investments to a large degree. The share quote would also
be cancelled.
Following the refinancing, which would include the injection of more than
Pounds 1m of new equity capital, the pension fund will own 103.8m new
shares, or 99.3 per cent of Cranbrook's new equity.
Existing shareholders, other than the pension fund, will end up with 716,524
new shares, representing the remaining 0.7 per cent equity stake in the new
private company.
The package, subject to shareholders approval, was made necessary by
Cranbrook's deteriorating financial position which was blamed on 'extremely
difficult trading conditions'.
National Westminster Bank considered requesting the appointment of a
receiver in December. However, that move was forestalled by the pension
fund, which owns a 27.4 per cent stake, and all of the company's 9 per cent
partly convertible loan stock agreeing to provide Cranbrook with a total of
Pounds 150,000 in secured loans.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: ML launches Pounds 14m rescue rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ML HOLDINGS, the loss-making defence and aerospace group which has been the
focus of bid speculation for the past year, yesterday launched a rescue
rights issue to bolster its balance sheet.
The company, which is 7 per cent held by the acquisitive TT Group, called
for Pounds 14.3m by way of a 2-for-1 issue of 100.5m shares at 15p. ML
closed steady last night at 18p.
Mr Howard Grant, the new chief executive, said that without the rights
proceeds ML would breach its financial covenants.
He denied ML had been forced down the rights issue route by banks. 'We did
not have a gun at our head,' he said.
Yet the banks have made receipt of the rights proceeds conditional for
renegotiated facilities. Previous financing arrangements were due to fall
from Pounds 27m to Pounds 20m on April 1, but the banks have agreed to a
three-year facility of up to Pounds 22m and an overdraft allowance of Pounds
3m.
Without the proceeds, debt would be 'slightly higher' than the Pounds 27m
reported last year. After the rights, gearing would fall from 114 per cent
at the year-end to less than 50 per cent.
Mr Grant said 1992-93 was 'a lost cause'. Mr John Bryson, finance director,
said trading conditions remained similar to the first half, when the group
reported a Pounds 1.48m loss.
Mr Grant said ML expected a total of Pounds 8.4m in provisions and
write-offs for the current year.
The proceeds of the rights issue would reduce ML's debt to a 'more
appropriate level and allow investment in the group's businesses.'
This would include about Pounds 4m of infill acquisitions and some equipment
renewal. The effects of recent restructuring would not be felt until next
year. Mr Grant expected ML to reap a Pounds 2m benefit from the 18 per cent
cut in jobs.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Carlton chief gets 84% pay increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Green, chair-man of Carlton Communications, the broadcasting and
media services group, received a pay rise of 84 per cent last year taking
his total remuneration to Pounds 520,000.
The rise came at a time when Mr John Major, the prime minister, has been
urging senior executives to show restraint on pay.
Mr Green received a rise of Pounds 122,000 on his basic pay, taking it to
Pounds 400,000. A further bonus of Pounds 120,000 was linked to a 16 per
cent increase in Carlton's earnings per share under an incentive scheme.
The pay rise was made by a remuneration committee chaired by Lord Sharp, the
former Cable and Wireless chief, and whose other members are Mr Nigel Wray,
a non-executive director, and Mr Green himself.
Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ and a non-executive director of Carlton,
will join the committee next month.
A review of Mr Green's salary, supported by outside consultants, concluded
that 'the chairman's salary failed to recognise the significant contribution
that he makes to the company, the progress the company has made in the last
year and the market level of remuneration of a person of his status within
the company.'
In the year to September 1992 turnover at Carlton increased by 17 per cent
to Pounds 701.6m, pre-tax profits by 15 per cent to Pounds 102.3m and
earnings per share by 16 per cent to 34.2p.
The average pay and bonus package for the chairman of a FT-SE 100 company is
about Pounds 400,000 with total packages ranging from Pounds 148,000 to
Pounds 6.2m.
Mr Nigel Walmsley, chief executive of Carlton Television, received a one-off
bonus of Pounds 250,000 'for his services relating to the company's
broadcasting interests.' The sum almost certainly relates to Carlton's
victory over Thames Television in the competitive tenders for new franchises
and for preparing the company for going on air. The bonus took Mr Walmsley's
salary for the year to more than Pounds 490,000.
Five directors were awarded options over 341,000 shares during the 1992
financial year.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hanson sees green shoots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HANSON, head of the Anglo-American conglomerate, told shareholders at
the group's annual meeting yesterday that he was 'heartened' by signs that
the UK and US were moving out of recession. The base rate cut was 'good
news', he said.
Orders were improving, but he warned that margins were tighter than last
year and that the recovery in profits would lag economic recovery because of
the amount of stock in the pipeline. Hanson shares rose 6 1/2 p to 243 1/2
p.
Further details of the Dollars 500m (Pounds 329m) asset exchange between
Hanson and Santa Fe Pacific, the railroads and minerals group, were also
announced.
Hanson is swapping Gold Fields Mining Company (GFMC), which has two gold
mines in Nevada and California, for Santa Fe's coal and aggregates
businesses. These will be integrated into Hanson's Peabody, the world's
second largest privately-owned coal producer, and Beazer subsidiaries
respectively.
Hanson said there would be 'no significant gain or loss as a result of this
transaction'. A straight exchange of assets is deemed by the US tax
authorities to be tax neutral.
Originally Hanson and Santa Fe were talking about swapping GFMC for Santa
Fe's coal mines, but it was agreed that Santa Fe should include its
aggregates businesses as well to make an equal swap.
Hanson is exchanging assets with a tangible net worth of Dollars 150m, but
with the goodwill attached to GFMC from the 1989 acquisition of Consolidated
Gold Fields, the assets are reckoned to be worth about Dollars 500m.
GFMC's pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 1992 were Dollars 52m,
but the declining gold price meant profits were expected to fall in the
current year.
Santa Fe's coal and aggregates businesses are in the books at Dollars 131m,
but are also deemed to be worth about Dollars 500m. Pre-tax profits in 1991
were Dollars 53m.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo to re-enter OTC market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday confirmed its
intention to re-enter the over the counter (OTC) non-prescription drugs
market.
The group announced that Mr Arthur Pappas, an existing board director, would
take responsibility for OTC products. His task, according to the company,
will be to develop and implement an OTC strategy for the group's existing
product portfolio.
All possible methods of achieving this would be reviewed, said Glaxo.
According to analysts, this might include creating, manufacturing and
marketing OTC products from scratch, making an acquisition, or securing a
series of co-development and co-marketing alliances.
During the past week, both the UK and US analysts have been worried that
Glaxo might dilute its earnings by acquiring Warner-Lambert, the US' fourth
largest OTC group after Proctor and Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and American
Home Products. Glaxo's shares fell 13p yesterday to 682p in a sharply rising
market.
Mr Mark Brewer, pharmaceuticals analyst at brokers Credit Lyonnais Laing,
said Glaxo's announcement was part of a strategy to protect some of Zantac's
cash-flow. New drugs, such as Astra's Losec are taking market share. The
medicine's US patents up to 2002 are also being challenged. If they are
successfully challenged, the drug could face generic competition after 1995.
Mr Pappas is relocating from Singapore to the US where both of Glaxo's main
competitors in the anti-ulcer market, Merck with Pepcid and SmithKline
Beecham with Tagamet, are planning to move their products OTC.
Analysts believed that Glaxo would be unable to convince regulatory
authorities to license full-strength Zantac for OTC use, and would have to
combine a weaker version with some form of anti-acid for upset stomachs.
Mr Pappas keeps his position as managing director for Latin America. He is
handing over responsibility for Asia Pacific to Mr Neil Maidment, managing
director Glaxo China and Glaxo Hong Kong who becomes an executive director.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: New issues show declining trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW COMPANIES last year raised more money through flotations than in any
year since 1987 but the number of new issues continued to decline, according
to KPMG Corporate Finance.
The number of full listings fell from 81 to 64 and entrants to the USM were
down from 10 to six. The total raised in-creased from Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds
2.3bn.
KPMG's figures exclude the effect of the Abbey National flotation in 1989
and government privatisations.
Mr Neil Austin, head of new issues at KPMG, said the larger average size was
further evidence that the Stock Market was not serving the interests of
smaller companies.
Almost all USM companies and 58 per cent of listed companies had market
capitalisations of less than Pounds 30m and faced problems of liquidity in
their shares.
While flotation remained an excellent route for some companies, smaller
quoted companies and some non-quoted companies were increasingly short of
access to new capital.
'There are well run, smaller companies which need access to equity if they
are to grow,' he said. 'Often they are not yet big enough to generate the
interest needed to have a liquid market in the shares after flotation.'
Development capital was not always an option.
Mr Austin called for institutional investors to consider setting up a
secondary market which could be restricted to 'sophisticated investors', who
might be made insiders, and who did not need the same degree of protection
that the general public required.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: US stakebuilding clouds future for Wessex
Water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESSEX WATER's future has simultaneously become clearer yet more murky.
Yesterday's fund raising and acquisition by its joint venture waste
business, Wessex Waste Management,signalled the company's determination to
build a meaningful arm outside the water core, and ended speculation that it
may branch out into a third area.
At the same time, however, the increased shareholding in Wessex by its joint
venture partner, Waste Management International, which could rise to 23 per
cent in 1995, raises questions about the US company's longer-term ambitions.
Both sides sought to play down the significance of the increased
shareholding yesterday. Mr Nicholas Hood, chairman of Wessex Water, said:
'They've never bought into a utility before, and the business they are
interested in is Wessex Waste Management, not Wessex Water'.
However, some analysts point out that Wessex Water derives more than 70 per
cent of operating profits from sewerage rather than water supply, suggesting
WMI's intentions may be wider than Mr Hood implied. 'WMI like to have
control, and eventually they will want to have control of Wessex,' one
observer said.
Despite these complications, yesterday's acquisition was well received.
Wessex has a good reputation with the stock market, where the original 1991
deal establishing the joint venture was applauded.
Because Wessex is one of the smaller of the 10 privatised water services
companies, it is better placed to build up a meaningful non-core business.
If regulation of the water companies becomes tougher after the 1995 interim
review, as many observers expect, earnings from non-core businesses should
be secure and will maintain dividend growth.
Following the acquisition, WWM should generate annual turnover of more than
Pounds 70m and profits before tax of at least Pounds 11m, before the
benefits of cost savings, described as considerable, flow through.
By 1995, WWM's contribution to Wessex group profits could have doubled from
7 per cent to 15 per cent. This would be one of the highest non-core
contributions to a water company.
Wessex and WMI, the international arm of Waste Management of the US, are
both betting that environmental law changes which come into effect in April
will benefit larger operators at the expense of 'cowboys', and improve
margins. Both companies said they made the acquisition on the basis of
assumed earnings growth and 'significant' additional contracted turnover.
WWM will also probably have the largest war chest in the waste sector, since
Wessex's Pounds 88m available for investment will be matched by WMI.
Assuming sellers can be persuaded to lower their asking prices, WWM could
soon emerge as market leader, especially since the acquisition takes it into
the important - although low margin - area of municipal waste.
As yesterday's purchase price suggested, acquisitions will not be cheap.
Wessex said the Pounds 113m price tag, payable in cash on completion then in
three annual installments, was good value, even though the NFC division
being acquired reported operating profits of only Pounds 4.4m in the year to
October 2.
Wessex said the price was fair because of the amount of consented landfill
and contracted turnover it is buying. However, its status as a lowly rated
water stock meant some dilution was inevitable when building a highly rated
waste division.
NatWest Securities yesterday revised its estimates for Wessex's profits in
1993-1994, when the latest acquisition will have its first meaningful
effect, from Pounds 90m to Pounds 98m. However, on a fully diluted basis,
earnings per share will fall from 68p to 58p.
Mr Peter Hyde, at Kleinwort Benson, said further dilution could not be ruled
out. 'Their strategy is to build a waste management business, and that is
going to be expensive because of the rating they are on,' he said.
Part of Wessex's aim is to narrow the gap between its rating and that of the
waste sector. It believes shareholders will be rewarded as the proportion of
earnings from waste increases, and the company's rating begins to reflect
both its water and waste operations.
What may help the rating sooner, especially as the expiry of the
government's special share grows closer in 1995, is speculation about WMI's
intentions. Wessex could be the first water company to develop a bid
premium.

FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Apax sells Sterling stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VENTURE capitalist which backed a management buy-out 10 years ago at
Sterling Publishing Group, owner of Debrett's Peerage, yesterday sold the
final tranche of its original investment, resulting in an overall profit of
Pounds 9.7m.
Apax Venture Capital Fund said it had sold its holding in Sterling following
an approach from stockbroker, Granville Davies. The stake comprised 12.7 per
cent of the ordinary , sold at 110p each, and 8 per cent of the convertible
cumulative redeemable preference stock at 315p.
Proceeds of the disposal amounted to Pounds 6.26m. This is in addition to
Pounds 4m received in previous sales and dividends.
Granville placed the shares with eight institutions, including Lazards and
Legal &amp; General.
Mr Ronald Cohen, chairman of Sterling and of Apax Partners, said the firm
had initially invested Pounds 500,000 in the company in 1983. 'It has been a
tremendous investment for us,' he said.
The Apax Fund was originally set up in 1981, with a 10-year life. It has
thus had an obligation to dispose of the Sterling stake, its largest
investment, for some time.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Boeing jobs at risk after sharp cut in 747 production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession in the world's aviation industry was underscored yesterday
when Boeing, the largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, announced a sharp
cut in production and Pratt &amp; Whitney, a leading engine supplier, said it
would slash employment by a quarter over the coming two years.
The production cuts will affect component suppliers worldwide, including
Lucas and Smiths Industries of the UK.
Output of the 747 will be reduced from five aircraft a month to three a
month in the second quarter of 1994. Production of all Boeing's models will
drop from 32.5 a month to 21 a month over the same period.
Boeing said it had yet to determine the impact of the cuts on employment but
it was expected to be 'significant'. The company cut some 7,600 jobs in
1992.
The cuts at Boeing include the 747, its biggest and most profitable product
and its only model to have avoided production slowdowns over the past year.
Boeing also announced fourth quarter net earnings before accounting changes
of Dollars 377m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, down from earnings of Dollars
403m, or Dollars 1.17 a share. Sales were Dollars 7.5bn, against Dollars
7.8bn in the fourth quarter of last year.
United Technologies, the parent of Pratt &amp; Whitney, yesterday unveiled a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 333m, or Dollars 2.77 a share, on sales of
Dollars 5.7bn after taking pre-tax charges of Dollars 701m or Dollars 3.45 a
share. That compares with a loss of Dollars 1.22bn, or Dollars 10.33 a
share, in the same period of 1991.
The charge - against the operations of Pratt &amp; Whitney, as well as United
Technology's flight systems division and general corporate expenses -
includes Dollars 447m for credit and other exposures to the airline
industry, Dollars 169m for contract matters, and Dollars 85m for additional
restructuring.
Pratt &amp; Whitney, which lost some Dollars 500m last year, said it planned to
cut employment to no more than 30,000 by the end of 1994, from 40,664 at the
start of this year.
Boeing insisted its cuts were not tied to any particular customer. However,
Japan Airlines, one of the biggest 747 customers, indicated earlier this
month that it would delay taking delivery of some of the aircraft and
analysts said two US carriers, Northwest and United Airlines, wanted a
stretched delivery time-table.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE share price of American Express, the US travel and financial services
group, fell sharply yesterday as Wall Street reacted with displeasure to the
news that Mr James Robinson had managed both to salvage his job as chairman
and to have himself named chairman and chief executive of Shearson Lehman,
the troubled investment bank and brokerage subsidiary.
Mr Robinson has been harshly criticised by Wall Street analysts for credit
losses, lower profits and pressure on the company's share price.
In early trading yesterday the price dropped by Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 23
1/2 , more than 8 per cent, before closing at Dollars 24.
Mr Robinson announced plans to step down as chief executive last month.
Instead the company announced on Monday that Mr Robinson would stay on as
chairman and that he would take over from Mr Howard Clark as chairman and
chief executive of American Express's Shearson Lehman banking and brokerage
subsidiary.
Mr Harvey Golub, the 53-year-old president of American Express, was named to
take over as group chief executive.
Sir Colin Marshall, the British Airways chief executive, had been a leading
outside candidate for the job and was contacted by the American Express
search committee, according to executives at the company.
Analysts were equally disappointed at losses reported for 1992 by Shearson,
as well as by the near halving of American Express group net profits for
1992, to Dollars 436m.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Airtours steps up campaign for Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS, the holiday company, yesterday stepped up its campaign to show
that the industry would remain 'highly competitive' if its hostile bid for
rival tour group, Owners Abroad, were successful.
In a letter to the Consumers' Association, Mr David Crossland, Airtours
chairman, described as 'grotesque' the suggestion that it would combine with
Thomson, the market leader, to create a duopoly. A copy of the letter is
being sent to the Office of Fair Trading which was last week asked by the
Consumers' Association to recommend a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission
Airtours is expected to explain its case to MPs, pressure groups and the OFT
before the Department of Trade and Industry decides whether to refer the
bid.
In its letter, Airtours accused the Consumers' Association of distorting
statistics. Its claim that a combined Airtours and Owners Abroad would have
a 34 per cent market share, ahead of Thomson, was wrongly based on
extrapolating November's figures for summer bookings.
Airtours holidays always sold well early in the booking season and combined
market share was likely to be 25 to 27 per cent.
Airtours said all the evidence showed there was 'intense price and other
competition' in the market and that there had been no fundamental changes in
the industry since Thomson took over Horizon in 1989. Mr Crossland said when
the MMC cleared Thomson's takeover of Horizon the markets were
'characterised by strong if variable growth, extensive competition and
continued entry by firms new to the industry'.
Rather than working against consumers' interests, Mr Crossland says Airtours
has consistently introduced new products, for example starting long-haul
charter operations to places such as Barbados.
'The greater the volume, the more confident you can be with higher risk
(more distant) destinations,' said Mr Crossland. 'Providing you are price
competitive and gave people a good holiday the year before then you are in
the frame for being chosen.' There was also no advantage for a tour operator
in concentrating the sale of holidays through its own travel agencies. Last
year's purchase of Pickfords would only give Airtours about 8 per cent of
total travel agency bookings.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Wessex Water in rights issue for NFC waste deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESSEX Waste Management, the joint venture between Waste Management
International of the US and Wessex Water, is paying Pounds 113m for the
waste division of transport and logistics specialist NFC.
Wessex Water is raising Pounds 144.5m by a rights issue and other funding to
pay for its share of the purchase, and leave Pounds 88m for future
acquisitions.
As part of the deal, Waste Management will lift its stake in Wessex Water
from 14.9 per cent to 20 per cent, with options to raise its holding further
to 23 per cent from 1995.
Mr Nicholas Hood, chairman of Wessex Water, said the acquisition would
're-orbit' the company and lead to significant profits from its unregulated
waste business when regulation of the core water business was tightening.
WWM, which was set up in 1991, will become one of the top five waste
specialists in the UK with annual turnover of more than Pounds 70m, just
behind market leaders Cleanaway and Shanks &amp; McEwan. Following the
acquisition, WWM's consented landfill space will increase from 18m cu m to
51 cu m and its employees will more than double to 1,200.
Mr Hood said the extra money raised could be used to buy smaller, add-on
companies in areas where WWM was weak, or to buy large waste companies 'when
the price was right'. WWM has recently looked at Econowaste, part of Tarmac,
but it is believed the asking price of about Pounds 100m was too high.
An original standstill arrangement preventing WMI lifting its stake in
Wessex above 20 per cent before 1998 has now been amended to 25 per cent. Mr
Joe Holsten, WMI vice-president of acquisitions and development,
acknowledged that the standstill arrangement could be changed again,
although a further increase was 'not even at the discussion stage'.
Wessex is raising Pounds 82.8m through the rights issue, which is the first
launched by a UK water company since privatisation in 1989. The one-for-six
issue, which is fully underwritten by SG Warburg, is priced at 480p, a 15
per cent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price of 563p. Wessex's
shares closed down 9p at 568p.
Wessex will raise a further Pounds 64.5m from WMI in the form of low-cost
financing and shares which gain voting rights in 1995.

Mohammed Ben Madani, editor of the Maghreb Review, is not best pleased with
the Moroccan authorities.
Returning to his native land on January 3 to see his ailing mother, after 25
years' self-imposed exile in London, Ben Madani was subjected to a less than
rapturous welcome. To whit, he was detained at the pleasure of the
Casablancan police for four long days.
He was not allowed to contact a lawyer, nor were his family informed of his
whereabouts. Nor, although interrogated at length about every period of his
past life, was he offered any explanation.
'They hinted it was something to do with a broadcast I made on the BBC World
Service, about Moroccan foreign policy and the nomination of a Moroccan
ambassador to Algiers,' he said yesterday, safe home in Bloomsbury. 'It was
part of a series by Patrick Keatley on the importance of monarchs.'
Sharing with six other people a cell just three metres square (and making do
on a loaf of bread a day between four), he was eventually released without
charge, and still without explanation. Morocco's ambassador in London,
Khalil Haddaoui, is investigating.

<TEXT>
Instead of seeing British Airways heads rolling over the Virgin Atlantic
affair, we now have Richard Branson and BA's Sir Colin Marshall looking
forward to building a new, writ-free relationship on the back of this week's
kiss-and-make-up session at Branson's Holland Park home.
Even so, one innocent bystander has been forced to make the ultimate
sacrifice. He is Roland Spark, the Sun's chief leader writer for the last 14
years, and one of the crispest pontificators in the press.
His crime? Dissociating himself from some other author's Sun leader
attacking British Airways's dirty tricks. Spark, now 63, thinks BA's
75-year-old chairman Lord King has been 'kicked around long enough' and
wrote a letter of sympathy after a particularly vicious Sun attack. When Sun
editor Kelvin MacKenzie learned about it, he sacked him.
If only the BA board were as ruthless. But then they might not be allowed to
get away with it.

<TEXT>
GJW Government Relations is one of the best lobbying firms around. It is
also one of the canniest when it comes to making money.
Having sold out for Pounds 6.5m to a company headed by Frank Lowe and Sir
Tim Bell just before the 1987 stock market crash, the three key figures,
Andrew Gifford, Wilf Weeks and Jenny Jeger, have bought back their business
 -now owned by Interpublic - for next to nothing. Andrew Gifford is terribly
discreet about the terms of the buy-back from Interpublic, a US advertising
agency, save to admit that most of the consideration is deferred.
If GJW does well, so will Interpublic. But given that GJW is three times
bigger, and profitable, than it was when Gifford and his pals last sold it,
they seem to have got a bargain. It also means that they can compete head on
with Sir Tim Bell's outfit without having to bother about the conflicts of
interest which forced them to sit on the sidelines during Hanson's stalking
of ICI, because Sir Tim was working for the opposition.

Take the one about his visit to an old people's home in his native

'No,' she responded, 'but if you ask that young lady at the desk she'll tell

Giles Radice, Labour MP for Chester-le-Street and the man who, as head of

Pennant-Rea his first job as a lowly research assistant, is planning a

As deputy chairman of the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service

England, together with his soon-to-be boss Eddie George, for a grilling in
front of the television cameras before the two men take up their
appointments in March.
George is in for a hard time. The Treasury committee report is expected
unanimously to criticise the Bank of England in its handling of BCCI.
But at least Radice still has a soft spot for Pennant-Rea. 'He was very much
a child of the 1960s, you know,' says he whimsically.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Too little, too late
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONE percentage point cut in the UK's base rate of interest, announced
yesterday, was necessary. But it will probably prove yet another case of too
little, because too late. The FT argued last October for an immediate cut in
base rate to 6 per cent, combined with a new fiscal strategy and, more
important still, with radical institutional reform, including an independent
central bank. The government clung, instead, to caution, when it should have
been decisive. It remained conservative, when it should have been radical.
It is paying the price.
Economic forecasts are inescapably imprecise. But the extrapolations of
current trends presented by the Institute of Fiscal Studies in yesterday's
Green Budget demonstrates why caution is probably the riskiest policy that
the government can now adopt. The probable developments in the fiscal
deficit and the current account mean, first, that the economy has to grow
and, second, that this growth has to be export-led.
Even if the economy were to expand by 1.8 per cent between 1992-93 and
1993-94 and 3 per cent a year thereafter, the public sector borrowing
requirement would still fall very slowly, argues the IFS, from its highest
peacetime level of 9 1/2 per cent of gross domestic product (excluding
privatisation receipts) in 1993-94. Balancing the budget over the cycle has
become a discredited slogan; the Conservative party's reputation for fiscal
prudence is in tatters.
The government has no option but to push for recovery. A slow recovery would
be riskier - given the prospective build-up of public debt, even riskier for
inflation - than a fast one.
The grim fiscal picture, the worsening prospects for external demand,
particularly in continental Europe, and the overhang of personal
indebtedness make interest rate cuts not merely necessary, but inescapable.
Exchange rate depreciation is a valuable bonus. Goldman Sachs argues, for
example, that the UK needs a further 10 per cent improvement in
competitiveness if it is to combine recovery with a current account deficit
below 3 per cent of gross domestic product.
Base rates must be pushed to a level at which early recovery becomes not
just possible, nor likely, but virtually certain. Moreover, they will be
pushed that low in the end, however cautious the government wishes to be.
The mistake has been not to push interest rates down faster. A principal
excuse for the caution is fear that the public would fail to believe in the
government's willingness to raise interest rates once more. Yet such caution
would be unnecessary if the government were not so determined to hold on to
all the levers of monetary policy. It is, after all, this determination
which makes the public doubt the government's willingness to raise interest
rates.
This government does not just keep on getting its monetary policy wrong. Its
determination to be able to do so has become an important reason for its
continuing to do so.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Test for Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BOUTROS Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has recommended that the
Security Council take 'whatever measures are required' to compel Israel to
allow the return of 396 Palestinians whom it deported to Lebanon last month.
It would be quite wrong to dismiss this as the partisan advice of an Arab or
an Egyptian.
In just over a year in office Mr Boutros Ghali has shown himself quite
willing to confront his fellow Arabs with unpalatable truths, including the
fact that Security Council Resolution 242 does not order Israel to withdraw
unconditionally from occupied Arab territory, and therefore is not
equivalent to the resolutions on Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait passed in
1990. But Resolution 799, demanding the immediate repatriation of the
Palestinian deportees, is a much more clear-cut affair. Israel's failure to
comply with it, and the council's failure to enforce compliance, does
contrast glaringly with the treatment of Iraq in a way which casts serious
doubt on the council's authority and credibility. The question is widely
regarded as a test case of the new world order.
Inevitably it is also a test case for the new US administration. Mr Bill
Clinton, like most newly elected US presidents, arrives in office festooned
with pledges to back Israel to the hilt. But he has also had a lot to say
about the importance of the UN.
If he is to have any hope of getting others to share the burden of world
leadership, as he clearly wishes, he badly needs to build up the UN, and
especially the Security Council, rather than undermine it.
It is inconceivable that the US would allow the UN to take military action
against Israel; scarcely less so for it to agree to economic sanctions. Yet
Mr Clinton must surely point out as forcefully as he can to the Israeli
prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, that in asking the US to use its veto in
such circumstances Israel is drawing very deeply on its reserve of goodwill,
in a country on which it remains heavily dependent.
The trouble is that Mr Rabin, very unwisely, has made the affair a test of
his own credibility with Israeli public opinion. If he is now seen to buckle
under international pressure, his room for manoeuvre when it comes to
concessions on bigger issues, ultimately of greater importance to peace and
to Palestinian interests, may well be reduced. The best hope is that
Israel's supreme court will let him off the hook by ordering that the
deportees be allowed to return pending appeal.
Failing that, the US could perhaps negotiate a compromise under which some
would return immediately while the period of deportation for the rest is
drastically shortened. What is certain is that all parties should treat the
affair as one of extreme urgency. Every day it lasts makes it harder for the
Palestinian delegation to return to the peace talks on the basis of anything
less than a complete Israeli capitulation.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Chancellor gets back to basics: The reasons behind
yesterday's base rate cut and its implications for economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was an interest rate cut that caught the City by surprise.
Just before 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the Bank of England was forced
into the unusual position of declaring a minimum lending rate of 6 per cent
because discount houses were not anticipating cheaper borrowing costs in
their dealings with the Bank.
But the Bank's move, which immediately triggered cuts in clearing bank base
rates from 7 per cent to 6 per cent, should have come as no shock. Since the
beginning of the year, economists and commentators in Britain had been
calling increasingly for a decisive lowering of UK base rates amid faltering
signs of economic recovery and news of sharply rising unemployment. In the
event, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, went half-way to meeting the more
radical of those calls: for a cut in base rates to 5 per cent.
There was some puzzlement yesterday as to why Mr Lamont had not cut rates
last week after Thursday's news of a jump in unemployment in December, or
the previous week when the government reported that the annual rate of
retail price inflation had fallen to 2.6 per cent last month. It seems
likely that the chancellor waited for signs that the foreign exchange
markets would accept a new rate cut without unceremoniously dumping
sterling.
In other respects, his move, decided in principle last week in talks with Mr
Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, and in consultation
with Mr John Major, the prime minister, is a calculated gamble. The
government is hoping that the latest cut - the fourth one-point reduction
since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism in September - will
give consumers the confidence to spend and businesses encouragement to
invest while keeping underlying inflation below its 4 per cent target
ceiling.
By cutting rates a full percentage point to their lowest level since 1977,
the government has almost certainly ruled out any further easing of monetary
policy before the Budget on March 16. Whether a further reduction is
announced around the time of the Budget will depend partly on monetary
conditions at the time but more on the fiscal stance that the government
adopts.
With independent forecasters now pointing to a public sector borrowing
requirement of more than Pounds 50bn in 1993-94, some analysts suggested
that yesterday's move may be part of a rebalancing of policy in which the
government might start cutting its fiscal deficits in the coming financial
year rather than in the second of this year's Budgets in December.
While the fiscal counterpart to yesterday's monetary easing remains obscure,
it was clear that the authorities feel they have more leeway regarding
inflation than they could have hoped for at the time of the last interest
rate cut in November.
At the same time, concern has grown about the gap between capacity and
output in the economy and the near certainty that unemployment will top the
3m level this month. The December jobless statistics were shocking not only
for the seasonally adjusted 60,800 increase in the numbers of unemployed
claiming benefit but also for the fact that the average monthly change,
whether measured over three or six months, is rising after nearly three
years of recession.
In his statement yesterday justifying the rate cut, Mr Lamont showed that he
is paying far more attention to what is actually happening in the economy
than to confidence indicators. As reasons for the move, he cited:
Monday's reports of slow growth in bank and building society lending and a
fall in broad money in December, which brought growth in M4, the
government's chosen broad money measure, below its 4 to 8 per cent
monitoring range for this year.
The 0.7 per cent fall in seasonally adjusted retail sales last month.
Falling pay settlements in the autumn and the drop in manufacturers' unit
wage costs to 0.5 per cent annual rate of growth in November.
Continuing falls in house prices over the past two months.
Weak price rises at the factory gate, with producer output inflation
(excluding food, drink and tobacco) of 2.4 per cent in November and December
 -its lowest level since April 1969. Although manufacturers' input prices
rose by a seasonally adjusted 7 per cent between August and November, they
fell marginally in December.
The chancellor ignored anecdotal and survey evidence that had persuaded some
observers that a rate cut was not in the offing until the Budget. Although
officials have welcomed recent reports of increased business optimism from
the British Chambers of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry
and the latest Gallup poll pointing to some recovery in consumer confidence,
these indicators have signalled false dawns in the past. They are no longer
considered a reliable basis for policy change.
There was, however, some debate between the Treasury and the Bank about
whether the cut should have been limited to 0.5 percentage points and so in
line with practice before Black (or White) Wednesday.
One argument in favour of a more cautious cut was the rise in December of
underlying inflation, as measured by the retail prices index minus mortgage
interest payments, to 3.7 per cent from 3.6 per cent and therefore close to
the top of the 1 to 4 per cent target band announced by Mr Lamont last
October. Officials admit that the underlying inflation measure is likely to
'flirt' with the 4 per cent target limit over the coming year. But it is
hoped that a steeper than expected downward trend in domestic cost pressures
should prevent underlying inflation breaching the barrier in spite of higher
imported goods costs following devaluation.
The low growth in unit wage costs and the recent decline in wage settlements
to just over 3 per cent are hopeful signs that inflationary pressures are so
low as to justify the full one-point rate cut. But if the government is to
meet its longer-term objective of price stability - defined as zero to 2 per
cent underlying inflation - wage settlements will have to be lower still and
unit labour costs falling. There is a reasonable chance of wage inflation
continuing to ease as negotiators focus on the headline rate of retail price
inflation, which is likely to continue downwards from December's 2.6 per
cent as yesterday's mortgage rate cuts and those that took effect earlier
this month feed into the index.
However, the debate over a 0.5 per cent cut suggests that the authorities
will be increasingly cautious about reducing interest rates further from
current levels, and that credence should be given to yesterday's health
warning that rates will rise again if inflationary pressures reappear.
What remains uncertain is the impact that the latest rate cuts will have on
activity. Opposition politicians were predictably sceptical yesterday. Mr
Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the government would 'have to
do far more on employment and industry to ensure substantial recovery'. Mr
Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman, argued that 'only
government-led investment leading to real contracts is likely to get
industry moving'.
The Treasury calculates that the latest rate cut should lower industry's
interest burden by about Pounds 1.25bn this year and brings to about Pounds
11bn per year the reduction on interest costs of successive rate cuts since
October 1990. Monthly payments on an average Pounds 33,000 mortgage should
fall by about Pounds 15, leaving the householder Pounds 160 a month better
off than 27 months ago.
The government hopes that by putting such funds at the disposal of companies
and households, it can break through the vicious circle of rising
unemployment, weak demand, falling activity, increased business failures and
still higher unemployment. Another aim is to inject some life into a housing
market crippled by falling prices, repossessions and negative equity.
There are already some encouraging signs, including a rise in inquiries at
estate agents, reports of retail sales growth this month and strong growth
of cash and bank notes in circulation. Interest rates of 6 per cent should
be good for activity. But after so many false dawns, only the brave would
predict the end of Britain's longest post-war recession.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Contenders lay claims to the title: The problems of deciding
ownership of confiscated east German property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last chance to claim ownership of property confiscated by the Nazis and
the former east German Communist regime ended on new year's eve. But the
workload of the staff at Barby, a sleepy village south-west of Magdeburg, is
unlikely to be affected.
For the past two years, the 30 employees at Barby, the centre of eastern
Germany's Grundbucharchiv, or land registry, have been inundated with tens
of thousands of requests from people applying for title to property
confiscated after the second world war. Now that the deadline has passed,
the staff will spend several more years scouring the land registers to
establish the whereabouts and status of the claimed property.
Mr Manfred Kottke, who was seconded from the Justice Ministry in Bonn to
oversee the process a year ago, says the task is enormous. 'One of the
problems is that the vast land registers are not on computer. We computerise
only the requests. It would take one year, and 300 people, to put the
registers on computer. We haven't got the time, or the personnel.'
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, east Germany's land
registry was taken over by the federal government. Barby has received more
than half a million requests from German citizens, emigres and foreigners
seeking information about their confiscated property. Officials at the
Justice Ministry in Bonn say the total number of claims could exceed 2m, and
could take up to 10 years to process.
Those whose property was confiscated between 1935 and 1945, and from 1949
until 1990, can seek compensation from local authorities and, in many cases,
restitution of the property. But people whose property was taken from them
during the Soviet occupation of 1945-49 cannot regain it. Instead, they can
seek compensation based on the value of property in the 1930s.
Mr Kottke said: 'Barby does not deal with the issues of restitution or
compensation of property. It is our job to locate, if possible, the original
land register for those who are able to identify where they held property
before it was confiscated. Once we have done this, we send them a copy of
the register so they can go through the courts or local authorities to
follow up the claim.'
Processing the claims can take as little as three weeks or as long as eight
months. 'In many cases, we receive inadequate information about the
whereabouts of the property being claimed,' said Ms Dagmar Schiffel, an
archivist. 'Some of the requests come from very old people, or from their
descendants and distant relatives who before 1989 had never visited the
former German Democratic Republic.'
Even if claimants can recall the exact location of their property, sometimes
it is not recorded in the land register. This is because the Nazis
frequently confiscated property from Jews forced to flee Germany or sent to
their deaths in the concentration camps, and tampered with the registers.
Many titles in the registers at Barby - the number is unknown - are covered
in thick black ink, and in some cases the pages have been torn out. 'The
Nazis were determined to show that these Jewish property holders never
existed, and that their descendants would never return and reclaim their
property,' explained Ms Schiffel. Once the Communists consolidated power in
east Germany after 1949, all property was placed in the hands of the state,
and the land registry was closed down in 1952.
But now, in a curious twist of history, former Nazis are claiming property
on the grounds that it was confiscated by the Communists - property they had
earlier illegally confiscated from Jewish families - according to Justice
Ministry officials and the staff at Barby.
As a means of establishing the legitimacy of the original title-holder, the
authorities at Barby have installed an infra-red machine, which can read
through the black ink on the land registers. 'But we can do little if the
page was torn out,' said Ms Schiffel.
The registers - large tomes dating from 1769 - are housed in the cellars of
a neglected, red-brick, 18th-century mansion, once owned by Prince Heinrich
of Saxony. Stacked on high shelves, they would stretch more than 15km if
laid out. Until 1979, the East German authorities used the mansion as a
hostel for Cuban and Vietnamese Gastarbeiter (guest workers). Then the
former Communist regime centralised at Barby the country's land registries,
which had previously been held by the individual Lander, or states.
'The place, strictly controlled by the Communists, was completely closed off
to the public,' said Ms Schiffel. 'Putting the land registers into some
acceptable order was done in complete secrecy.' Thankfully, the German
tradition of bureaucracy and order outweighed any temptation the Communists
might have had to destroy them.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Serious fraud
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of recent trials has thrown grave doubt on the ability of the
criminal justice system in England and Wales to handle cases of serious
fraud. Trials have begun too long after the events to which they relate.
Indictments have been excessively complex. Proceedings have stretched to
inordinate length and cost millions of pounds before collapsing or ending in
acquittals.
Fiascos such as last year's Blue Arrow trial - in which all the defendants
were eventually acquitted - have raised questions over the competence of
juries to hear serious fraud cases. However the fault in such trials has
lain more with the prosecution which overloads charge sheets and with judges
unable to keep a grip on proceedings. In a report published yesterday, the
Bar Council rightly urges the retention of trial by jury for serious fraud
as for other serious crimes. Instead, it proposes reforms to streamline
fraud trials and make them more manageable.
These include efforts to clarify for the jury exactly what is at dispute in
a trial. Non-contentious summaries of events might be distributed at
intervals to keep jurors informed of how the case is developing. And the
trial could be structured to focus closely on points of difference between
prosecution and defence, so that the jury knows exactly what they have to
decide. These recommendations are sound and since most could be introduced
without new legislation, they should be implemented speedily.
New legislation would be needed to give effect to the Bar Council's proposal
to introduce a more specific offence of simple fraud to replace the
catch-all charge of conspiracy to defraud. This would make the nature of
charges clearer to jurors by specifying particular acts as fraudulent. It
might also encourage more defendants to plead guilty, knowing exactly what
they are pleading guilty to; a guilty plea to a conspiracy charge exposes
the defendant to unpredictably severe punishment.
Such guilty pleas - which save the courts time and money - might be further
encouraged by the wider use of plea bargaining in serious fraud cases. While
bargaining over charges goes on informally at present, it could be extended
to sentencing. It should also be brought into the open as part of court
proceedings under the supervision of the judiciary.
Finally, the Bar Council suggests that only cases leading to a custodial
sentence should be tried in court. Where the likely penalty for a serious
fraud offence is a fine, restitution or disbarment, the regulator is better
placed to deal with the case. This approach has much to commend it, although
regulators would need to be more open in their proceedings to avoid charges
that financial fraudsters were treated more leniently than other criminals.
The Bar has set out an agenda for reform which has the merit of being
simpler and therefore more realistic than other offerings. It should be
acted upon.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Fuzzy future of American TV: The Big Three television
networks are facing a prolonged period of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Larry Tisch and David Letterman made for rather an odd couple - perched
alongside one another recently on director's chairs in a room on the 19th
floor of 'Black Rock', the Manhattan headquarters of CBS Television. Mr
Tisch, the diminutive billionaire investor who controls CBS, was informing
the world that he had just poached Mr Letterman, the tall, sandy-haired
comedian and chat show host, from rival NBC for a salary reported to be
about Dollars 14m a year.
In doing so he won a high stakes battle between two of America's four
national networks. The competition between CBS, which under Mr Tisch has
strengthened its management and become the top-rated network in terms of
audience share, and NBC, which has fallen into the ratings cellar and seen
its profitability tumble, comes at a critical time for the networks.
Recession and declining advertising revenues have taken a toll over the past
two years. Cost-cutting has become the new religion as the industry
undergoes a bout of soul-searching, strategic rethinking and management
reshuffling.
The growth of the cable television industry, as well as that of Mr Rupert
Murdoch's profitable and expanding Fox network, have also combined to pose a
new threat to the traditional Big Three networks - ABC, CBS and NBC. A
decade ago the networks held 85 per cent of the market of 93m
television-watching American homes. Today that share has dropped to little
more than 61 per cent, largely because of inroads made by cable television
and Fox.
Mr David Weston, a senior vice-president and general counsel at ABC
Television, says his superiors at Capital Cities, the media company that
owns ABC, 'have a deep concern that we need to realign our cost structure.
One cannot spend the same amount of money on a third of a market that
reaches 60 per cent of US homes as one did on a market that captured nearly
90 per cent of the viewers.'
The American television industry is at a crossroads, according to Mr Weston,
who says that the current uncertainty stems from the fact that the networks
have been slow to react to the growth of cable.
That the industry is in the middle of profound change is evident from
estimates of operating profits of Dollars 200m made last year by Time
Warner's Home Box Office (HBO) cable programming subsidiary - more than any
single network earned. HBO is in a partnership with ABC to develop new
programming for the network's lacklustre Saturday evening line-up, something
that might have been unthinkable a few years ago, when the networks viewed
cable as the enemy.
Mr Michael Fuchs, chairman of HBO, has presided over a steady average
profits growth of 10 per cent a year for the past eight years. HBO is no
longer just a cable programmer; it has diversified and is now among the
biggest outside suppliers of shows for Fox. But Mr Fuchs says that while he
foresees an increasing number of alliances between the networks and cable,
even more radical change is on the horizon. 'At the end of this decade it's
not going to be cable and broadcast any more - it's going to be television.
It is not even inconceivable that a cable company might own a network,' he
predicts.
Clearly the old structure of American television is breaking down. The
ownership of all three networks has changed hands since 1986 and the need to
share costs has led to co-operative programming ventures involving cable,
networks and Hollywood studios.
The current turmoil, which was partly driven by a decline in advertising
revenues in 1990-91 and partly by the view of network executives that they
must change their target audiences to compete with cable, has manifest
itself differently at each network.
CBS experienced a slump in morale a few years ago amid harsh staff cuts on
the news side and made a Dollars 405m loss in 1991 when it spent too much on
sporting events. But the new management installed by Mr Tisch has received
plaudits for its successful new programming, and is estimated to have turned
a small profit in 1992.
Ms Jessica Reif, entertainment analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, the New York
investment bank, says that hiring Mr Letterman for the late night-slot could
prove a highly lucrative move, taking viewers from NBC's popular Tonight
Show and thus worsening NBC's position as the network with the lowest
audience share.
NBC's management is the most widely criticised in recent television history.
Observers fault its senior executives, who include Mr Robert Wright, the
network president who came from General Electric, the company that owns NBC
and is widely believed in the industry to be willing to sell it if the right
buyer offers Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn.
Mr Wright's background includes years in the plastics business; his most
recent job was running GE's financial services business. 'The GE people are
deal-makers who know about widgets, but they are not very good at managing
creative talent,' according to a senior executive at a rival network who
asked not to be named. Mr Wright could not be reached for comment.
The picture at ABC, which is presently offering buy-outs to many executives
as part of its cost-cutting programme, is somewhat better. The network,
which has the second highest prime-time ratings, is generally deemed by Wall
Street analysts to be the best-run of the Big Three. Ms Reif of Oppenheimer
is forecasting a 1992 operating profit for ABC of Dollars 114m, the highest
of any network.
The financial position of the Big Three has been further complicated by Fox,
which has come a long way since it was launched six years ago by Mr Barry
Diller, who resigned last year as Mr Murdoch took over day-to-day operations
as chief executive of both the Hollywood studio and the television network.
Observers have been puzzled by a string of recent executive departures and
reshuffles at Fox, but Mr Murdoch insists there was no turmoil at the
network and says that some of the personnel changes had been planned before
Mr Diller's departure.
Mr Murdoch, who says Fox's revenues in the year to next June will rise to
more than Dollars 600m from Dollars 440m last year, praises the bigger
networks for 'stringent' cost reductions. He seeks, however, to distinguish
his own attitude toward the cable industry from that of other networks by
saying his rivals have considered cable the enemy, whereas Fox wants 'to be
friendly with them'.
In fairness, Fox is not the only network with links to cable. ABC owns 80
per cent of ESPN, the lucrative cable sports channel, and has other cable
interests. And NBC has CNBC, a cable financial news channel.
The growth of cable over the past year has slowed, however, and newly
approved federal legislation could help the networks by forcing cable
operators to pay local stations for the right to carry their signals. The
networks could also gain when the Federal Communications Commission finally
responds this spring to a recent court order requiring that it clarify the
muddled financial-syndication (fin-syn) rules that ban networks from moving
into the syndication market and other areas.
'The networks are likely to be less regulated, even unshackled,' predicts Ms
Reif. She adds that in the near term networks should also benefit from the
US economic recovery and signs of a modest improvement in advertising.
Mr Weston of ABC says it is unrealistic to expect any of the Big Three to
achieve double-digit growth in advertising revenues again. The exception is
Fox, which has prospered as a start-up operation with new programming that
includes comedies and tabloid shows which have more appeal to young viewers
than more standard network fare.
In broader terms, the likely future of US television could be radically
different in as little as five years. Digital compression technology means
that cable operators such as Tele-Communications Inc, the nation's biggest,
could offer 500 channels of programming within two or three years.
The implication of the continued proliferation of viewer choice is more
cost-sharing, joint ventures and perhaps even mergers between cable and
network television companies. The only certainty in American television,
therefore, is the prospect of change.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Letter: Justifiable despair over Britain's economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GAVIN CLEZY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is not often that I find myself so diametrically in disagreement
with an article appearing in the Financial Times, but Sir Geoffrey Owen's
'The Myth of Britain's Decline' takes the biscuit. Anyone who has worked in
industry and commerce as I have done for 40 years, and largely at the sharp
end overseas, is in no doubt that regular doses of despair over Britain's
economic performance are absolutely justified. We should drink deep draughts
of the stuff]
He blames the media for trotting out the usual culprits, but both the press
and politicians seem very loath to confront, respectively, their readers and
the electorate with the unpalatable truth that the British people
themselves, in failing to measure up to competition in world markets, are
largely to blame for Britain's undoubted decline. We British must accept
that we must begin to match in our attitude to work the diligence and
dedication, not only of the Japanese and Germans but also an increasing
number of nationals such as the Koreans and the Taiwanese. Until we do
Britain will continue its inexorable descent down the slippery slope, taking
with it our valued institutions and our standard of living.
As George Walden MP rightly said recently, 'tell the people the truth'. And
the truth is that the deep-seated flaw that Sir Geoffrey doubts exists is
conspicuously clear in an all too common sloppy disregard of customer
interests both domestic and overseas. There are brilliant exceptions such as
British Airways, which, despite its present problems, has in recent years
given an impressive performance on a world stage, but we need more. I hope
Sir Geoffrey will accept what I say as the constructive self-criticism which
he says is welcome.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Letter: Only the technical innovators can expect to compete
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN MACKINTOSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the report 'Getting ideas to market' (Technology, January 21), the
impression is given that Professor John Kay of the London Business School
has a jaundiced view of the role of technical innovation in determining
commercial success.
While this article may not fully represent the views of such a respected and
senior economist, my own position at UCL requires me to make the point that
technical innovation is of salient importance in business enterprises of all
kinds.
In the first place, there is massive evidence that only those companies
which have learned to harness the power of technical innovation can prosper
in a competitive marketplace.
Of the older British companies, Pilkington and float-glass technology spring
to mind, of course; but also Glaxo which, contrary to a point made in the
cited article, rose to global status through its intelligent use of
innovation in developing the anti-ulcer drug, Zantac, in competition with
the similar and then-dominant drug, Tagamet. And, on a topical note, it is
not difficult to believe that most of IBM's recent and well-publicised
problems stem from its inability to practise market-led innovation as
competently as its competitors.
On the other hand, a significant portion of world trade is now conducted by
companies of which we had hardly heard 20 years ago.
Prime innovators such as Intel, Nintendo, Compaq, Microsoft and Sony have
grown rapidly - sometimes to where they dominate their sector - on the basis
of a new idea, thoroughly researched, carefully developed, diligently
produced and intelligently marketed: or, in short, successfully innovated.
It would be possible to go on and on, of course. But I believe that the
world and his brother actually know by now that innovation is a 'good
thing'. What they may not know is how to practise it effectively, which is
the cause to which this embryonic UCL-based foundation is devoted.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Foreign Affairs: Same deal as before - The Danes did not win
new concessions on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark has a new government. The foreign minister has pledged himself to
secure a Yes to Maastricht in the second Danish referendum on the subject,
to be held probably 'before June'. All's right with the world.
Some moaning Euro-minnies are still muttering about the dangerous precedent
set by Denmark's special 'opt-outs', negotiated at last month's Edinburgh
summit. Won't Conservative backbenchers try to obtain the same deal for
Britain, as the price of ratification? Won't candidates for EC membership,
with three of whom formal negotiations are to start on Monday, demand that
the same exemptions apply to them? Isn't this the beginning of the a la
carte union so dreaded by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission?
Much louder is the chorus of self-congratulation. Danish ministers have
waxed eloquent about their success in wringing recognition of their
country's special preoccupations from their European colleagues. The one
thing everyone seems to agree on is that Denmark did obtain significant
concessions, and that to squeeze these through without amending the treaty
required ingenious legal draftsmanship.
The truth is slightly different. The reason the treaty does not need
amending is that it has not been changed. The deal being offered to the
Danish people in 1993 is the same one they rejected in 1992.
In popular journalistic shorthand, Denmark has been exempted from: European
citizenship, economic and monetary union (Emu), joint defence and some
aspects of co-operation on justice and home affairs. But to see what has
actually happened, one has to read the official conclusions of the Edinburgh
summit, in conjunction with the text of the Maastricht treaty. On
citizenship, the 'decision' of the heads of state and government in
Edinburgh says nothing about exemption, nor about Denmark. It simply says
that European citizenship does not replace national citizenship, and the
latter remains a matter of national law.
In the annexed unilateral declaration, Denmark itself explicitly undertakes
fully to 'respect all specific rights expressly provided for in the treaty
and applying to nationals of the member states'. It turns out that nationals
of other member states already have the right to vote in Danish municipal
elections, and the declaration actually warns that Denmark 'has no intention
of accepting' that the Maastricht arrangements on this point 'could lead to
rules detracting from the rights already given in Denmark'.
I suppose it is conceivable that some Danish voters rejected Maastricht last
June out of fear that the existing right of foreigners to vote in their
local elections might be curtailed. If so, they have been fully reassured.
On Emu, Denmark does indeed have an opt-out from phase three (the single
currency), as does Britain. But this opt-out was already contained in a
protocol attached to the treaty as originally negotiated. All that happened
in Edinburgh was that Denmark served notice in advance of its intention to
exercise the right accorded to it by that protocol.
That notice is, of course, not irrevocable. In fact, the Edinburgh decision
says quite explicitly that Denmark may 'at any time . . . in accordance with
its constitutional requirements, inform other member states that it no
longer wishes to avail itself of all or part of this decision'.
Moreover, the duration of the decision is governed by articles Q and N(2) of
Maastricht. While article Q says the treaty is of unlimited duration,
article N(2) promises a revision conference in 1996. There is thus a clear
implication that Denmark's opt-out will be on the agenda of that conference.
Denmark did not need to be exempted from joint defence, since Maastricht
only refers to this as a future possibility. The treaty does foresee 'the
definition, in time, of a common defence policy', but leaves defence as such
to the Western European Union, of which Denmark has chosen to become an
observer rather than a member. The Edinburgh decision notes this, and draws
the conclusion that 'accordingly, Denmark does not participate in the
elaboration and implementation of decisions and actions of the Union which
have defence implications'.
The heads of state and government also noted Denmark's intention not to
exercise the presidency of the Union when matters with defence implications
were discussed, and stated that in such cases 'the normal rules for
replacing the president, in the case of the president being indisposed,
shall apply'.
On justice and home affairs, the decision says explicitly that Denmark will
participate fully. A separate declaration points out that, although under
article K9 of the Maastricht treaty some aspects of these affairs can be
transferred from an intergovernmental procedure to an EC one, involving
qualified majority voting, a unanimous decision is required before any
transfer can be made. And it notes that in Denmark such a decision will
require a five-sixths parliamentary majority or a referendum. But nothing in
the original treaty could have obliged Denmark to adopt any such decision
without going through that procedure. The essence of unanimity is that no
state can be obliged to implement something it has not agreed to.
In short, all that happened in Edinburgh was that Denmark's rights under the
treaty were spelt out. One may reasonably hope that the misconceptions of
some Danish voters were thereby removed, and that this will encourage them
to change their vote. But any claim by Denmark's leaders to be offering a
new and better deal this year than last is, not to put too fine a point on
it, boloney.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Letter: Call to amend commercial property legislation flawed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D I HUNTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The call by the governor of the Bank of England for commercial property
legislation to be amended is flawed and displays a lack of understanding of
the economics of the property market ('Commercial lease provisions
criticised by Bank', January 21).
First, on privity of contract, he should realise that a property lease is
like any contract; it is for an agreed period between the two contracting
parties. Under most commercial leases the tenant is entitled to assign his
obligations, often to a letter covenant. It is absurd to suggest that by
doing so the original tenant should escape his contractual obligations.
It is also quite inappropriate for the governor to quote the example of
Scots law on privity without acknowledging that tenants in Scotland do not
have the protection of the Landlord and Tenant Act.
Even more importantly, in suggesting that the 25-year lease with five-yearly
upwards only rent reviews should be abolished, the governor is again wrong.
It would clearly be morally wrong to interfere with existing leases - just
as contracted interest rates cannot be unilaterally altered. The terms of
new leases will be a matter for negotiation between landlord and tenant.

Sir, When Lord King set about the task of turning round British Airways he
sacked a great many people, explaining as he did so that it took too long to
change people's attitudes - it was quicker to change the people.
I cannot imagine why this memory came back to me as I read your comment
about the unsatisfactory nature of the statement from the board of BA ('BA
off course', January 22). Lord King's place in history is secure, as -
strangely enough - seems to be the place of the slogan 'Fly the flag', which
came to me one lunch-time as I was walking from the offices of BA's then
advertising agency FCB to the Savile. But it is not just slogans that have
their day. Directors do too.

Sir, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen has once again spoken out refreshingly on a
controversial issue ('Danish speech on Macedonia provokes Greek rage',
January 21). Maybe the Greeks could learn from a precedent set in this part
of Europe, where the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg happily exists alongside the
Belgian province of Luxembourg. The latter provides much-needed staff for
the Grand Duchy's financial services industry in the form of cross-border
commuters. These 'frontaliers' sleep safely at night knowing that the
monetary union between Belgium and the Grand Duchy protects their earnings
from any devaluation (sorry, realignment) of the latter's currency.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Arts: Author's first novel wins Whitbread award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swing Hammer Swing], a first novel by the Glaswegian writer Jeff Torrington,
was last night voted Whitbread Book of the Year. It describes a Gorbals
Christmas in the late 1960s from the viewpoint of a working class family
beset with problems. The style is a blend of Glaswegian dialect and
Chandleresque movie-speak and is full of gallows humour. The book is
published by Secker and Warburg at Pounds 7.99.
Torrington, 57, has worked in factories most of his life and had only
previously been published in anthologies of short stories. He takes the
prize of Pounds 20,500 to add to the Pounds 2,000 he received when he was
shortlisted for the Whitbread as the First Novel Award winner.
It was a close contest with Victoria Glendinning's biography of Trollope
(winner of the Biography Award) which had been the favourite for the prize.
The other candidates were Gillian Cross for The Great Elephant Chase
(Children's Novel Award); Alisdair Gray, also from Glasgow, for Poor Things
(Novel Award); and Tony Harrison's book of poetry The Gaze of the Gorgon.
The Duff Cooper Prize does not carry the financial muscle of Whitbread -
prize money is just Pounds 500 - but it brings great prestige to the writer
of the winning book, to be announced on Monday.
For the first time there is a short list. It consists of Linda Colley for
Britons: Forging the Nation; Peter Hennessy (Never Again); Paul Johnson (The
Birth of the Modern); and Conor Cruise O'Brien (The Great Melody).
The other major sponsored arts prize announced yesterday, the Barclays Young
Artist Award, has been won by twins, Louise and Jane Wilson, 25, graduates
of Goldsmiths' College. They share Pounds 10,000 in what is the leading
award for young artists just emerging from post- graduate studies.
Another Pounds 10,000 is split between eight short-listed artists, six of
them women. The winning entries are on show at the Serpentine Gallery until
February 28.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Arts: The Last Yankee - Theatre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Arthur Miller, the American playwright who made his name with such pieces as
Death of a Salesman and The Crucible in the late 1940s, early 1950s, is
having a remarkable Indian summer. His excellent The Ride Down Mount Morgan
had its premiere in London just over a year ago. Now comes the shorter, but
equally compelling The Last Yankee which contains one of the most moving
scenes I have ever seen in a modern play.
More of that in a moment. First a word about the rest of the piece and the
Miller style. His speciality is dialogue between fairly ordinary people,
Americans who can't get on or cope as well as they would like. The Last
Yankee is set in a state mental home, but there is no evidence that anyone
is particularly mad - just disturbed and unhappy.
There are four characters. (A mysterious fifth presence sleeps through
without speaking.) Patricia (Zoe Wanamaker), a Swedish American and mother
of seven, is there largely, it seems, because she is depressed by her
husband's lack of ambition. A descendant of Alexander Hamilton, he prefers
being a carpenter to making money. The husband (Peter Davison) is a visitor
not a patient, though he too can come quite close to breakdown. If his
profession reminds you of Christ, this is deliberate but not overdone. He is
a saint-like figure with a lot to put up with. The pair who turn The Last
Yankee into drama, however, are an older couple.
John Frick, played with immense authenticity by David Healy, is a building
contractor who has sold his business for, one assumes, a large sum of money.
He again is a visitor not a patient; his wife, Karen, is there because she
does funny things, like getting up and tap-dancing at two o'clock in the
morning. In other words, her husband doesn't take enough notice of her.
Much of the dialogue is inconsequential. The two men talk about the
car-parking facilities and the surprisingly highstandards of the state home
compared to a private institution. Miller also throws in odd facts, like the
poverty of Swedish Americans when they first arrived in the 19th century,
and the incidence of unsuccessful treatment for depression. Talk of money is
never far away.
The really stunning moment comes towards the end when Karen performs her
tap-dance in the full regalia of top hat, tail coat, cane and satin shorts.
Very briefly her husband is persuaded to sing 'Swanee' to accompany her. The
scene comes unexpectedly and is almost over before the tears have welled up,
but you will seldom see anything better on stage. Helen Burns's Karen is
squat and not pretty; her humanity is overwhelming.
The immaculate direction is by David Thacker.
Sponsorship is by Mercury Communications.

Not too many British are aware that a foreign power planned to invade our
soil in 1970. It was the Irish government, planning to reclaim Ulster,
according to Timewatch, BBC2's fortnightly history slot (8.10), which this
week traces the origins of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Irish
ex-cabinet ministers and leading Republicans shed light on the role that the
Republic played in nurturing the Provisional IRA.
Jerry Hall is the guest star who kicks off the first episode of The
Detectives (BBC 1, 8.00), a comical cop-show devised as the vehicle for the
moderately side-splitting talents of Jasper Carrott and Robert Powell. Of
distinctly more mirthful stuff is the eponymous star of Victoria Wood (BBC
1, 8.30), who returns in a repeat of the popular series which she wrote.
The Late Show (BBC 2, 11.15) drops its usual, irritatingly brief magazine
format and devotes all 40 minutes to its penultimate exploration of art and
culture in Russia. Viktor Eroveyev, a new wave novelist, floats around
Moscow looking for the exciting cultural manifestations which are emerging
from the debris of official Soviet art.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Arts: Return of the 'Screw'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since it was seen first at the English National Opera 13 years ago, Jonathan
Miller's staging of Britten's Henry James opera has always commanded
admiration. In this latest revival by David Ritch, nothing seems second-hand
or dated. The current fascination with child abuse prompts new frissons,
perhaps, as no doubt does the popular 'revelation' of the composer's shy
faiblesse for boys with unbroken voices. But the production here makes no
sticky capital of those; in its (partly new) cast, it has all the capital it
needs.
In David Hersey's lighting (reproduced by Neville Currier), the designs by
Patrick Robertson and Rosemary Vercoe still look faultlessly apt: shadowy
projections of country-house views upon a quasi-Japanese structure of pale
screens, casting disoriented perspectives beyond them. In the pit James
Holmes conducts his first-rate small ensemble to searching, vigorous
purpose. There is no longueur.
As the haunted children Miles and Flora, 12-year-old Samuel Burkey again
offers tight little smiles that suggest inner stresses, and Megan Davis -
new to the cast, but much older - captures sinister pubescent mischief with
uncanny success. Like their elders, they play with a subtlety rare on a big
stage like the ENO's, and they sing in consistent character. Christine
Bunning repeats her vampirish Miss Jessel, a delectable study in ruined
allure.
Philip Langridge returns as the abuser from beyond the grave, Peter Quint,
imperious and ambiguous, with a copper-coloured mane and trenchant,
transparent diction. That latter virtue also makes his new doubling as
Narrator a superb prologue to the piece, every word steeped in unspoken
forebodings. This will be no surprise to regular opera-goers, who are well
aware that Langridge is now at the remarkable peak of his operatic prime;
but interested occasionals should know that missing Langridge in a
performance like this would be something to kick yourself for later.
There is a fine new Mrs Grose from Mary Lloyd Davies, who projects
conviction and looks utterly to the manor born, a model of trim, homely
decency. Toward the end, after her sleepless night hearing Flora's ghastly
dream-confessions, I thought she looked under-harrowed - but the style of
this Turn of the Screw does not accommodate raw scarification.
Neither did Valerie Masterson's new Governess reel much at the final
catastrophe, which left her 'Malo' lullaby with less wrenching Affekt than
it wants. This well-loved soprano wields such tremulous, nerve-end poise,
however, and such vulnerable beauty and frailty, as to make her already
unforgettable in the role. It is her first operatic entry into Britten, and
a perfect choice. On the first night, the ensembles were not yet in perfect
focus; when they are, and Miss Masterson can bestride them with full
dramatic authority, she will be more memorable still.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Arts: Macho harassment, not management - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After watching Exposure, Monday night's film in C4's Cutting Edge series, a
lot of middle managers must be nervously wondering what might be coming
their way. The fashion for executives being sent on survival courses has
been around a good while now, but Monday's film showed us the fearsome
reality. Cameras followed 24 managers aged 29 to 51 from Rockwater, an
international underwater engineering company, as they underwent six days of
purgatory devised by the grandfather of management survival courses in the
UK, the notorious John Ridgeway.
Notorious yet also risible, from the first glimpse of Ridgeway on a grassy
knoll in the Scottish Highlands, the autumn wind whipping at his baggy
shorts as he fervently declaimed Newbolt's lines 'Play up] play up] and play
the game]' But if any of the Rockwater crew felt inclined to titter, they
were soon laughing on the other side of their faces.
After being ordered to leave most of their gear behind, the teams of six
with their hatchet-faced instructors slogged away through the rain. Hours
later they had to strip and swim to an island where, blindfolded, they
erected tents big enough only for five. One of the tents blew over in the
night. Next morning, the weather forecast was terrible, which pleased
Ridgeway; bad weather promotes bonding. In a 90 mile-an-hour gale the teams
were told to climb a 2,500ft peak. The chap from PR collapsed half-way up
and had to be hauled to the top. He was in a funk for the rest of the week .
. .
Rockwater had asked for an extra-tough course, for which it paid Pounds
25,000, and no physical or mental frailty was tolerated. So you suffer from
acute vertigo? You will climb a 70-foot mast] You can't swim? You will dive
under the yacht] To refuse means your team loses points, and that is very
wrong, and in the evening everyone will sit round in informal counselling
sessions and discuss why you are such an uncooperative, non-bonding, wimp.
Pain, anger, humiliation and naked fear made for excellent TV. On the last
afternoon, a somewhat staged-looking 'mutiny', when the managers refused to
plunge yet again into the icy sea on the grounds that it was 'totally
stupid', was taken as proof that the course had indeed forged excellent
team-spirit. This seemed a curious conclusion. Would the same view have been
taken had the managers mutinied on the first afternoon when faced with an
equally stupid exercise?
The fundamental question was whether a company has the right to ask
employees to submit to 'an exercise in sadism', as it was described by one
of the victims, a Dutchman. My heart warmed to him. Throughout the week the
staunch libertarian voiced his objections to this kind of bullying, just as
his stout-hearted ancestors once resisted the tyranny of Louis XIV. So what
made him, or any of them, agree to take part? The chain-smoker, the American
woman with a grass allergy, none of them looked the type to have
commando-style fantasies.
Why should someone who performs a cerebral desk-job submit to a punishing
physical and mental ordeal merely because his or her superiors (male, I bet)
share a mystical belief that such an experience is especially valuable in
fostering team spirit? Although the doubting Dutchman's colleagues claimed
he did indeed become better to work with, that might have been no less true
had they been playing croquet at Cannes all week.
We generally like others to suffer as we have done, so the fact that
three-quarters of the Rockwater victims said they wanted their staff to do
the course only proves why fagging survived for so long in English public
schools. Ridgeway and his like may yet flourish in the so-called 'caring
'nineties'. Yet the thought persists that there is a host of attributes
which it might be advantageous for a company to nurture in its best people;
imagination, cunning, humour, patience, self-reliance, independence of
thought . . . Might it not be equally valid to send managers on courses to
learn to play the Welsh harp, or chess, or work with Mother Teresa? Sexual
harassment may have been outlawed in the workplace, yet it looks as if macho
harassment is still OK.
The last part of the three-part Assignment Special, Europe on the Brink (BBC
2, Tuesday) was a futuristic account of a European super-state two decades
hence, at war with the North American super-state (inter alia) over
oil-exploration in the Arctic. What was a neat enough idea perhaps
inevitably turned out to be a dull and rather silly exercise easily confused
with Yes Minister.
Thanks to her manner, which is grave and sincere, Francine Stock is an above
average current affairs presenter. Unfortunately, this series suffered
terribly from producer's fidgets. An examination of the deep political and
economic structure of Europe, it was hardly going to offer much to
gnat-brains, who would anyway have been glued to EastEnders. And yet, the
view seemed to be that the gnat-brains would be there in force. Each
distinguished talking head was duly given a sound-bite of around 40 seconds,
often less. Flit, Michael Howard warning of the rise of anti-Islamic racism
in Europe. Flit, Karl Otto Pohl on his fears of the east-west gap. Minutes
later and back we would flit for another weighty sentence or two.
Even worse were the musical fidgets. To accompany a steelworks, a blast of
Tannhauser. A second or two of plain-chant for Jacques Delors meeting EC
commissioners at the Cistercian abbey of Royaumont. A few bars of Vivaldi
for Venice and the bon gusto of Benetton - part two must have sampled around
20 different composers, which was pretentious and thoroughly silly. It is
nice that classical music is back in vogue, but a good deal less nice if the
result is this kind of wild overdosing.
*****
For bad music, one needed to have watched Gallowglass (BBC 1), Ruth
Rendell's alias Barbara Vine's thriller which ended ghoulishly on Sunday
with Nina's manicured hand sticking up from the forest's ferny floor. First
rule of a so-called psychological thriller has to be, find some damn' fine
actors. At the centre of this drama was an epicene upper middle-class youth
who had a truly fin de siecle obsession with a classy blonde model. She,
rather improbably, he had helped to kidnap while studying art-history or the
like in Italy, and then set free after a brief bout of terrific sex.
This Italian plot needed to be established by endless flashbacks, a
convention rarely satisfactory on film, and Gallowglass proved no exception.
Paul Rhys, who played the kidnapping fantasist, was decorative but never
credible whereas Joe, his nerd-like accomplice, was a much better role
played with some subtlety by Michael Sheen. Everyone and everything else was
so-so, and no better.
On Wednesday, some twenty million people bade farewell to Central TV's
Inspector Morse. By now, little more needs to be said about Morse, except to
mourn his passing. However, since he was not mown down by one of Oxford's
9,000 deregulated buses, nor decapitated by any of the city's 19,000
ridiculous hanging baskets, at least he is available to return to our
screens.
A few Turcophiles will have preferred to see what Bookmark (BBC 2) made of
Yashar Kemal. The answer was, as the Turks say, hich, nothing. Kemal is a
wonderful, extremely enjoyable novelist, and it is baffling he was not given
the Nobel prize decades ago. But no one could have divined as much from
interminable scenes from an unnamed novel, woodenly acted by a cast of
gloomy Anatolian villagers who looked as if they would far rather have been
watching TV than making it.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Arts: 'Stiffelio' launches Verdi venture - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Opera has planned a great Verdi adventure: a season-by-season
conspectus of all the operas, intended to be complete by 2001. On Monday the
company launched it in properly adventurous style, with the first
professional British staging of a Verdi rarity.
In the complete list of his operas Stiffelio (Trieste, 1850) comes just
before Rigoletto, and is probably the finest of all those Verdi works that
continue to remain little-known - a stark piece, notably original in form
and subject matter. For contemporary tastes the story must have been
unpalatably gloomy. The unwilling adultery of a travelling Protestant
minister's young wife has preceded curtain rise, which then reveals, in a
succession of economically unfolded scenes, his return and discovery, her
abasement and - probable sticking-point for an 1850 audience - eventual
forgiveness.
Themes of guilt, dishonour and personal-versus-public morality are examined
with a disquieting unvarnished directness of dramatic diction. As in so much
'early' Verdi, the lack of wasted notes, and the sudden short spells of
formulaic rum-ti-tum side by side with the composer's radical overhaul of
form, are at times almost disconcerting.
For these reasons, and also because of the censorship difficulties
experienced by Verdi right from the start, failure seems to have been as
inevitable as it was undeserved. Once he had determined on re-making the
opera - as Aroldo (Rimini, 1857) - into a less troublesome, though also less
interesting, tale of a revenant crusading knight in 13th-century Kent, he
abandoned the original. Its autograph is lost; until the Parma revival of
1968, Stiffelio was thought of as a marginal episode in the long epic of
Verdi's compositional career.
Since then, fringe revivals and a good Philips recording have rectified the
impression. At the start of 1986 the Fenice in Venice presented a series of
Stiffelio and Aroldo performances (short operas, both) on a single evening:
a fascinating clarification-by-comparison of the dramatic strengths of the
former and the many musical enrichments and improvements of the latter.
Now, at Covent Garden, Stiffelio gets what is probably its first front-rank
revival in modern times. The company has risen to the task with admirable
seriousness - indeed, its leading Verdian, Edward Downes, is not only
conductor but editor of a new, carefully scrutinised and corrected Stiffelio
performing edition.
The result is a remarkable occasion. The re-instatement bid has been boldly
made. By ideal (no doubt hopelessly unrealistic) standards of measurement,
its goal is still not entirely achieved, since the Royal Opera cast is in
each of its three principal parts a notch or two under the strength implied
by Verdi's extraordinarily demanding, and expressive, vocal writing.
But in Elijah Moshinsky's production (designed by Michael Yeargan, sets, and
Peter J. Hall, costumes) the work's dramatic 'modernity' - a quality of
operatic Ibsen avant la lettre is so precisely evoked that everyone on stage
and everything in the plot is presented in a powerfully affecting light. The
production team have exchanged the Austria of the original for a bleaker
location, non-specific 19th-century northern; the influence of heavy
naturalistic painting styles on the material shape and dramatic focus of
each scene is apt and purposeful (apart from an erratic Act 2 lighting
plot).
Sobriety of demeanour rules. Small gestures betray large inner struggles;
the 'community ethic' is shown to be both tightly binding and terribly
oppressive. In Moshinsky's treatment the great closing scene of forgiveness
 -musically one of Verdi's fieriest and most tautly evolved constructions -
may end with a late-20th-century question mark rather than a
mid-19th-century full stop, but the 'woman's issue' is quietly, not crudely,
raised.
This seems to me one of Moshinsky's most impressive Verdi stagings. It
elicits a similar quality of plain-speaking authority from Downes and the
orchestra and chorus; Monday's performance had not quite the over-arching
sweep of that never-to-be-forgotten 1990 Attila, perhaps because the
Stiffelio cast seemed to need much more vigilant nursing, which Downes
managed with his usual unfussed mastery (the prompter likewise, much in
evidence). The woozy trumpet solo that sets off the opera's curiously
commonplace overture was an exception to the general rule of fine playing.
The title role comes first in the line of Verdian studies of dramatic-tenor
obsessiveness. Jose Carreras does not carry its big guns; nor does he
possess - has he ever possessed - in his operatic persona the necessary
forcefulness of declamatory fire a la Martinelli or Vickers. This being so,
it is wonderful to find him so much strengthened in voice, so determined to
give every phrase and statement fullest possible measure, so honest at every
moment.
In the finale his rapt concentration of address proves deeply moving; this
is likewise the peak of Catherine Malfitano's performance. A singer of
lustre and an actress of controlled eloquence, she works unceasingly - and
often surprisingly successfully - to fill out lines intended for a much
grander and more expansive category of soprano voice. Gregory Yurisich's
coarse-toned delivery of the father's role was harder to accept, although he
too is a presence on stage.
In smaller roles Gwynne Howell and Robin Leggate (the seducer, faintly drawn
in the opera) do very well. In sum, while not the last word on Stiffelio,
this affords the house's Verdi cycle a notable start.

FT  27 JAN 93 / People: Barclays - speedy moves to and from Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays Bank, which has been more severely hit than most of the clearing
banks by bad loans, is for the first time apppointing a director of group
credit policy. At short notice, it is bringing back one of its top men in
Japan, Alan Brown, to fill the job and sending out a UK corporate finance
specialist to fill his slot.
Brown, who went to Tokyo three years ago, will report straight to Peter
Wood, Barclays' finance director.
Brown joined the bank from Oxford in 1968, and progressed up the clearing
side before becoming a director of Barclays Merchant Bank in 1981. Before
Japan he was deputy head of the corporate division.
A Barclays spokeswoman said Brown would be looking at credit policy from a
strategic point of view, 'not authorising individual loans, but looking at
the mix and balance of the portfolio. No one individual did that before'.
Before Christmas the bank confounded the City with the news that it had lent
Pounds 440m to a single property developer, Imry, against which it was
providing Pounds 240m, more than any UK bank had ever previously had to set
aside against a loan to a single company.
BZW acknowledged that Brown's return from Barclays in Japan, which under the
new structure reports to BZW rather than to Barclays, was not ideal. 'The
timing is not what we would have decided for ourselves. We had to find
someone to pick up the reins,' a spokeswoman said.
Hence Callum McCarthy, who only last month had been appointed chairman of
BZW UK corporate finance, goes out to replace Brown, who was in charge of
corporate and structured finance, foreign exchange, money markets, swaps and
options and what remains of the corporate lending business in Japan.
This is curious in so far as McCarthy, who was headhunted in 1989 together
with Graham Pimlott from Kleinwort Benson, came in to beef up the UK
corporate finance client list, a task in which the two have had limited
success. McCarthy had previously been an under-secretary at the DTI.
Meanwhile, BZW's securities business in Tokyo remains under the wing of Ben
Grigsby, who assumes country manager responsibility from Brown.

The Inland Revenue's huge computer services operation has a new chief. John
Yard, 48, takes over as director of the Revenue's Information Technology
Office, succeeding Geoff Bush. He will be responsible for all the IT needs
of the Inland Revenue, including 2,600 staff, a budget of Pounds 250m a year
and the 13 regional computer centres.
John Yard is one of the diminishing band of top civil servants who has
worked his way up from the bottom of the ladder, having joined the civil
service in 1962 as a clerical assistant in the Ministry of Labour. He
transferred to the Inland Revenue, becoming a tax inspector in 1971 and
working as a district inspector in the west end of London. In 1988, he
became deputy director of operations, in charge of developing systems for
the Revenue's local office network. For the past nine months he has been
running a new change management group planning strategy for the department
in the 1990s.
Geoff Bush remains with the ITO, concentrating full-time on the Revenue's
search for a partner from the private sector to jointly develop IT in the
Inland Revenue.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Technology: Emission-free car shows its mettle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the big three US car makers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, ready
to co-operate more closely on the development of an electric car, metal
producers are watching developments with great interest, as electric
vehicles promise big new markets for both lead and nickel.
Inco, the Canadian group, reckons that by 2000 there will be 200,000 to
500,000 electric vehicles produced each year to meet legal requirements.
Given the short time-scale of the tough emission laws in California, and
with other states considering whether to follow, car makers see electric
vehicles as the only available technology to give immediate pollution-free
driving.
To meet the challenge, the Advanced Lead-Acid Battery Consortium (Alabac)
was formed in the US. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry
also has an electric vehicle battery programme.
With tentative plans to keep conventional cars out of the polluted centres
of European cities, Fiat of Italy and Peugeot of France estimate that by
2000 there will be a European market for 250,000 electric vehicles a year.
For nickel producers, this means the search is being speeded up for better
rechargeable batteries - to take vehicles further and faster, charge more
quickly and need charging less frequently.
Five different types (nickel-cadmium, nickel-iron, nickel-zinc,
nickel-hydride and nickel-sulphur) are under study. Competition is mainly
from standard lead-acid and more advanced batteries under development, such
as sodium sulphur or lithium systems.
Inco believes a new nickel market of 25m lbs to 60m lbs a year would be
created; present nickel consumption in batteries is probably less than 22m
lbs. Altogether, countries outside the former eastern bloc will consume
about 1.5bn lbs of the metal this year.
Lead-acid battery producers are also enthusiastic about electric vehicles.
At the Alabac headquarters in Durham, North Carolina, experts reckon this
type of battery offers the only affordable alternative to the internal
combustion engine in vehicles.
'If society is to make a big impact on pollution from cars, a large number
of people have to switch to electric or hybrid cars. And only electric cars
with lead-acid batteries can be priced within reach of large numbers of the
population,' says John Sharpe, an Alabac official.
Alabac makes no estimates about future demand, but the potential for lead
producers can be judged from the fact that today's conventional battery in a
US car weighs between 60 and 70 lbs.
Lead-acid battery packs in an electric vehicle would weigh between 600 and
800 lbs, while there would be about 400 lbs of batteries in a hybrid
vehicle. Most of the weight is accounted for by the lead content.
Today, about 5.5bn lbs of lead, or 60 per cent of that consumed, is used in
batteries, of which about 1.1bn lbs is used in the production of new cars.

FT  27 JAN 93 / People: Clarke moves to another Australian team
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Clarke, a former head of the London office of Australian brokers
Potter Warburg, has joined the London arm of County NatWest Securities
Australia, where he will help develop its corporate broking business.
Clarke, one of the best known figures in London's Australian broking
community, is the latest in a string of Potter executives who have defected
to County NatWest Securities Australia, one of the few jewels in the
overseas operations of National Westminster Bank's often troubled investment
banking operations.
County NatWest Securities Australia was formed six years ago around a
nucleus of young ex-Potter executives who had quit following S G Warburg's
decision to take a 50 per cent stake in Potter. Led by Rob Thomas and Kevin
Crotty, and recently joined by Greg Burns, a top equity salesman, County
NatWest Securities Australia has overtaken the renamed Potter Warburg, and
now has the biggest share of institutional broking business in the
competitive Australian market.
The arrival of Clarke, who had been with Potter for 24 years, is fresh
evidence of County NatWest's plans to exploit its strength in Australia's
secondary market by expanding its corporate broking side. Clarke's new job
will be much the same as it was at Potter Warburg. He will set up a
corporate and investor relations unit in London.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Technology: Falling victim to its own success - Germany's
recycling scheme is under attack from both industry and environmentalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For millions of conscientious Germans, rubbish is not just something to be
thrown away these days. It is looked at closely first. If the packaging has
a green dot, it goes into a special yellow bin and not into the usual black
container.
Printed on 80 per cent of all packages sold in Germany - including wine
bottles, food wrappings, cans and cartons - the green dot (der grune Punkt)
has become the most visible sign of the ambitious German scheme which aims
to sort, collect and recycle the bulk of household waste.
But one and a half years after its birth, the green dot system has come
under attack. Concerned that the fast-growing scheme is fostering a
monopoly, the Federal Cartel Office recently opened an investigation against
Duales System Deutschland, the nationwide rubbish collecting enterprise
which operates the green dot system. Moreover, an increasing number of
environmentalists claim the system is only a fig-leaf used by industry to
avoid costly environmental investment.
Launched in mid-1990 by 600 German industrial groups, DSD was set up after
parliament adopted a ground-breaking law which raised hackles in the
packaging industry in Germany and the rest of western Europe. The law
effectively coerces manufacturers into recovering and re-using the ever
increasing quantities of packaging waste, and has been considered by the EC
as a possible blueprint for a European packaging directive.
Meanwhile, member countries are trying similar systems. Last September,
France set up an 'eco-emballage' scheme which requires municipalities to
collect packaging products already marked for sorting. So far, the scheme is
in its infancy, with little sign of the French picking up the habit of
sorting their own rubbish. Arthur D Little, the US management consultancy
group, is devising a DSD-type organisation for the more orderly-minded
Austrians.
The German law says manufacturers must ensure that, by July 1 1995, 80 per
cent of all packaging is collected and that 80 per cent of this amount is
recycled. There is a phase-in period: since January 1 1993, 60 per cent of
glass packaging, 40 per cent of tin-plate packaging and 30 per cent of
aluminium, cardboard, paper and plastic packaging has had to be collected.
The law obliged Lander (states) to choose, by January 1 1993, a nationwide
waste collection and recycling system. Most Lander have chosen DSD, which is
now required to extend its operations from house-to-house collection into
the small business sector.
Set up to operate in 95 per cent of German cities and districts - not all
affected households have yellow bins yet - DSD has attracted the attention
of the Berlin-based cartel office with its planned expansion. 'We cannot
ignore the law, but we must decide the limits within which DSD should be
allowed to operate,' says Jurgen Kiecker, the cartel office spokesman.
DSD regards the cartel office's move as unjustified. 'The law forces us to
have a nationwide network and therefore operate as a monopoly,' replies
spokeswoman Ines Siegles. 'And the Lander are now calling on us to organise
the collection of packaging in the business sector. This is an extra burden
for us, as it means developing a new collection infrastructure for
industrial packaging.'
Furthermore, she argues, DSD is a non-profit organisation. The system itself
is based on the 'polluter pays' approach. For DSD and the packaging
industry, that means the end-user. Consumers pay an average of two pfennigs
on products bearing the green dot. The money is used to cover the expenses
of DSD, which collects and sorts the waste before handing it over to
recycling companies. Set up by industries to ensure that waste gets recycled
as prescribed by the law, DSD does not make a profit or sell the waste.
But small recycling enterprises, which depend on DSD to supply the collected
waste, have been complaining to the cartel office. They claim DSD prevents
competition in the recycling industry.
DSD has a network of waste disposal contractors across the country. Run on
the grounds that it is more cost efficient, the network is fostering a
concentration in the waste industry. 'We cannot say now if the recycling
industry will also become monopolistic as a result of DSD activities. But
pressure is likely to grow on legislators to ensure this is not the case,'
says Frank Annighofer, German-based head of Arthur D Little's European
environmental department.
Those members of the recycling industry which do business with DSD defend
themselves against the complaints of their competitors. They say that the
large investments needed to make recycling profitable for some products,
such as plastics, justify expansion.
But the capacity of the recycling industry remains below the targets set by
the ambitious law. Recycling industries which were well-developed before its
adoption, such as those for glass and paper, have been able to cope with the
increased quantities of collected waste.
Today, some 44 per cent of the feedstock into the German paper industry is
waste paper. A similar percentage applies to glass products.
For more complicated industrial products, however, where recycling is less
profitable, reprocessing facilities are lacking. According to Annighofer,
plastic is recycled 'for political reasons'. Scientifically, so little raw
material is recovered that it makes more sense not to recycle plastic
products.
The waste industry estimates that it will need to invest about DM7bn (Pounds
2.8bn) to build up an efficient infrastructure for all forms of waste
disposal.
The law offers a solution to the under-capacity of the recycling industry,
however. Classifying waste as raw material, it allows for it to be exported.
About 30 per cent of the 350,000 tonnes of plastic products to be collected
in 1993 by DSD (out of an estimated 1m tonnes of plastics used each year in
Germany) will be exported to foreign countries, including France, Belgium,
Switzerland and China.
The export of German waste has led to a series of international
controversies. To ward off accusations of illegal dumping, DSD has pushed
for the investigation of waste disposal contractors.
The independent German Technical Inspection Agency (TuV) is now charged with
verifying the sorting and recycling plants in Germany and abroad. It submits
regular reports to DSD on incoming and outgoing materials.
But some environmentalists claim that inspection is not enough to ensure
viable ecological processes are carried out. They say that waste exported to
developing countries is not being recycled but dumped or incinerated
instead.
'The law offers a neat way of circumventing the Basle Convention limiting
the export of waste,' says Michael Braungart of the Hamburg-based
Environment Protection Encouragement Agency, a private institute. 'It also
takes incentives away from industry to invest in recycling its products at
home.'
But industrialists say such problems will be solved in time. 'Every law
opens up 1,000 questions for each waste disposal company and manufacturer,'
says Norbert Bohm, a director of TK Umweltdienste, the DSD waste disposal
contractor for Bonn. 'It takes know-how and large capital investment, which
cannot be acquired overnight.'
Clearly, incentives for recyclers will increase as more waste is collected.
The venture's success will also depend on the public's response. Other
European households could soon be treated to the sight of 'Hugo the bin' and
'Egon the sack', two comic characters used on German children's television
to publicise the green dot.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Management: The toddler begins to show promise - How AT&amp;T
and NCR bucked the trend of failed computer marriages to form a successful
partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was not love at first sight, but a match based on the sheer wealth of the
rudely aggressive suitor. Many onlookers pronounced with relish that it
would all end in tears.
Yet after 18 months of married life, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's
Dollars 7.5bn (Pounds 4.9bn) takeover of NCR, the US computer company, seems
to be shaping up rather better than the Jeremiahs predicted.
NCR and AT&amp;T's much smaller computer business have combined their product
lines and sales forces relatively smoothly, and without any evidently
serious loss of customers. And whereas AT&amp;T's old computer business lost
money for years, the merged entity is modestly profitable.
Nor is there any of the rancour which critics feared could linger between
the two companies in the wake of AT&amp;T's hostile bid.
However, these are still very early days and the combined business has a
long way to go to justify the Dollars 7.5bn paid by AT&amp;T or the strategic
thinking behind the takeover - that the convergence of computer and
telecommunications technology will give a competitive advantage to a company
which successfully combines both skills in-house.
Still, the progress so far does point up some lessons for the management of
computer sector mergers, which in the past have proved difficult to execute,
either because of differences of technology, making it hard to put customer
bases together, or of corporate culture.
Four main factors have helped overcome such potential difficulties: the way
in which AT&amp;T approached the takeover; the technological similarities
between the two companies; the compatibility of their product mixes and
customer bases; and the execution of the merger.
Arguably most important was AT&amp;T's decision from the outset of the bid that,
although it would be acquiring NCR, it wanted NCR to be in the driving seat
as the computer operations of the two companies were merged.
There were very good reasons for this. NCR, the fifth largest computer
manufacturer in the US, was a large and reasonably successful business.
Founded as National Cash Register in Dayton, Ohio, in the late 19th century,
it had expanded far beyond its origins in retail sales tills into general
business information systems, though its slowness to move from
electro-mechanical to electronic equipment in the 1960s and 1970s had left
it in the second rank of computer companies.
However, at the time of the bid, NCR had just started introducing a new
product range which correctly anticipated a move by the industry towards
open systems, which allow computers made by different manufacturers to
operate together, rather than proprietary products, which lock the customer
into one company's products.
By contrast, AT&amp;T's computer operations were only founded in the mid-1980s,
were much smaller and were awash in red ink. AT&amp;T essentially handed this
business to NCR and said: 'Take what you want, discard the rest, but make
sure you keep customers happy and are profitable.'
Charles Exley, the NCR chief executive who headed the fight against AT&amp;T,
left the company when the bid was successful but his place was taken by
another NCR executive, Gilbert Williamson, the former president. AT&amp;T's
clear-cut approach to the post-merger power structure meant, he says, that
there was no waste of energies discussing 'who's going to sit in the corner
office'.
NCR only took on about 2,000 of AT&amp;T's 7,500 computer staff and AT&amp;T formed
a special unit responsible for redeploying the discarded employees elsewhere
in the group.
As a result, NCR did not become bogged down in politicking or administrative
minutiae and could remain externally focused, concentrating on the critical
tasks of combining product offerings and reassuring customers that they
would continue to be served properly.
In so doing, it was helped by the fact that both companies were pursuing the
same technological strategy of open systems based on Unix, the computer
operating system devised by AT&amp;T, with microprocessors manufacturered by
Intel.
The two companies shared a belief that the future of the industry lies in
what Williamson likes to call the 'new way of computing'. Apart from a
commitment to open systems, this involves computer power being distributed
by networks across an enterprise, using many small desktop machines, rather
than being centralised in a mainframe computer.
Transition teams, involving people from both companies, began integrating
the product range the moment the takeover was clinched, and three months
before the deal was legally consummated.
They found there was a lot less overlap than many had expected. Take, for
example, network interface boards, the peripherals which allow a computer to
connect to local and wide-area networks. There was only one serious conflict
among 36 products made by the two entities.
Nor was integration of the sales force too difficult, since the two
companies had different areas of strength. NCR was particularly well placed
internationally (some 60 per cent of its revenues came from outside the US)
and in finance, retailing and state and local government.
AT&amp;T was essentially North American and better represented in
telecommunications, transport, manufacturing and the federal government.
Culturally, too, the two businesses were a relatively good fit. Both were
members of the eastern business establishment, but both had been through big
shake-ups in the recent past. AT&amp;T, once a slow-moving, paternalistic
bureaucracy, was turned into a more profit-oriented operation through a
restructuring in the late 1980s.
Since the merger, AT&amp;T headquarters has largely left the computer business
to run itself, though NCR has been exposed to AT&amp;T's business methods by
representation on the parent company's management committee and numerous
cross-business initiatives.
But while the combined business is reporting profits, these are modest and
are partly dependent on NCR's two large non-hardware businesses - computer
services and business forms.
Moreover, while NCR is faring reasonably well in a depressed computer
market, it still seems less dynamic than some of its most direct US
competitors, such as Hewlett-Packard, which has been enjoying double-digit
revenue growth.
Nor is it clear how strongly NCR will grow when the US and European markets
recover. Its areas of greatest strength, cash registers and banks' automated
teller machines, are mature although the link-up with AT&amp;T will help it
introduce more sophisticated offerings, such as an ATM which identifies
customers by voice, rather than the numbers punched on a keyboard.
Significant growth is likely to depend on gaining market share in the
ferociously competitive general business computer market, and on using the
AT&amp;T link to provide both innovative products and distinctive ways of
solving clients' computer networking and communications problems.
NCR now has one of the industry's broadest product lines, which is
compatible across the range and fully dedicated to open systems. Elton
White, the company's president, reckons AT&amp;T has given the company much
stronger networking products.
However, open systems by definition allow customers to pick and choose
equipment from the cheapest manufacturers or those who are fastest to market
with new products, and neither AT&amp;T nor NCR have traditionally been known
for strength in these areas.
Moreover, some of the greatest profit opportunities in computer networking
come from providing software. Many industry analysts feel NCR still lacks
muscle here, though company officials argue that AT&amp;T's celebrated Bell
Laboratories may add to their strength.
Even less certain is how far AT&amp;T's telecommunications businesses and NCR
will take advantage of the convergence of the two industries. Williamson
says six cross-business initiatives set up after the merger have produced
some early results, and he is enthusiastic about the potential. He insists
that this depth of co-operation could not have taken place in an alliance
between two separate businesses.
The proof will come in the form of new products. The company is promising to
unveil the first 'computing telecommunications' product next year and Lee
Hoevel, who heads the technology and development division, says NCR can
spend three to five years just 'strip mining' inside Bell Laboratories,
'going after ore that is already there, buried by a small layer of dirt of
disuse'.
'As mergers go, so far so good,' says Bob Allen, chairman of AT&amp;T. 'We've
done better than most people expected, but the jury's still out. It's
probably going to be five years before people can look back and say this
made sense.'
An article on AT&amp;T's wider strategy appeared on the Features pages

FT  27 JAN 93 / Management: Blow for passive smokers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Environmental Protection Agency's recent classification of
second-hand cigarette smoke as a first-class carcinogen is prodding many US
companies to reassess workplace smoking rules. The judgment makes employers
which do not ban smoking more vulnerable to lawsuits.
The EPA ruling blamed passive smoke for 3,000 lung cancer deaths a year in
the US. New federal regulations, to be issued as a result of the EPA report,
could soon make it mandatory for companies with more than 10 employees to
prohibit smoking at the workplace altogether.
Such regulations would mean the end of employee smoking rooms. 'Because the
smoking room uses the same ventilation system as other offices in the
building, it doesn't provide enough protection to non-smokers,' said Fran
Dumelle, deputy managing director of the American Lung Association.
Many US companies have already banned smoking, and groups of smokers can
increasingly be seen huddled outside large office buildings.
Concern over smokers traipsing out of doors in inclement weather has
prompted some of the more innovative companies to erect external 'smoking
shelters'. They look like bus shelters and shield smokers against rain, wind
and snow.
The ALA also recommends that companies offer 'smoker sensitivity training',
which explains to non-smoking employees how difficult it is for smokers to
quit.
Many employers also adopt a series of motivational programmes to encourage
smokers to give up. These often include support groups with worksite
meetings, free counseling and discounts on nicotine patches.
Cigarette companies say the problem should be addressed in another manner.
'With improved ventilation systems, non-smokers would not be bothered by
people smoking,' said Thomas Borelli, director of science affairs for Philip
Morris.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Jobs: Why creativity isn't all in the mind - Ability to work
innovatively depends on far more than a talent for thinking up novel ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOULD readers who have proved yourselves creative in your work care to help
the Jobs column in settling an argument?
To avoid misunderstandings, it had better be said that being 'creative in
your work' does not refer to such feats as contriving artistic arrangements
of flowers on your desk before sitting down at it to ensure that precedent
is followed to the letter. For a working achievement to count as creative,
it has to satisfy four conditions.
Firstly it must be novel. Secondly it must be effective in serving a
valuable purpose. Thirdly it must be decisively if not entirely of your own
devising. Fourthly it must meet all the previous three conditions not only
in your own estimation, but in the judgment of at least some other people
with a sound claim to know what they are judging.
Creativity of that sort is the nub of the aforesaid argument. It arose at
the British Psychological Society's occupational group conference this
month, during a session starring Fiona Patterson and Tom Smith of Ford of
Europe, where they are concerned with recruitment and staff development.
Their topic was how a company can best select people with such creative
abilities for its workforce.
One way not to do so, the Ford duo suggested, was by relying on tests
supposedly designed for the purpose. The reason they gave was that, since
would-be recruits can usually see that creativity is deemed important in the
job at issue, the tests tend to make it easy to fake the 'right' answer. And
to show how, the speakers produced three questions from tests on the market.
In the case of the first two of them, the Jobs column readily agrees that
the desirable answer is obvious. Both were of the same type, facing
candidates with a statement and a choice of responses to it, then asking
them to mark the one closest to their own heartfelt reaction.
In both instances, too, the possible responses were (a) strong disagreement,
(b) disagreement, (c) uncertainty (d) agreement, (e) strong agreement. The
first statement was: Creative ideas do not come easily to me. The other
read: I do not feel my ideas are innovative.
Neither seems apt to present much of a stumbling block to an ambitious
job-seeker aware that the recruiters deem creativity a plus-point. Indeed,
the only difficulty would be in deciding whether any candidate who failed to
mark (a) or at least (b) was simply uncreative, or half-witted into the
bargain.
Where the argument arises, however, is over the conference speakers' claim
that the desirable answer is similarly obvious in the third sample question
they cited. Being doubtful myself, I'm inviting readers to try it and see.
The task is to consider the unfinished statement which comes first, then
decide which of the alternative endings best matches your attitude to the
topic concerned. (The original offered three endings. But since one was of
the 'un-decided' type clearly meant to identify folk not creative enough to
make up their mind on the issue, I'm giving only the two firm choices.) OK,
here goes:
Discussion with ordinary, habit-bound, conventional people . . .
A . . .is often quite interesting and has a lot to it.
B . . .annoys me because it deals with trifles and lacks depth.
Now, which of the two is 'obviously right' in the sense of being the answer
that would honestly be given by a really creative worker?
In the view of the Ford duo, it was evidently B denoting belief that there
is nothing potentially to be gained from the comments of ordinary,
habit-bound, conventional people. But while that may be so in some highly
specialised pursuits - pure mathematics might be an example - I cannot
believe that the same applies in more than a very few of the occupations in
which creativity is of value. On the contrary, in most cases, a keen and
attentive ear for such people's observations is surely an essential part of
the ability to work creatively.
Nevertheless, while I disagree with the duo on the response, the ambiguity
of the question leads me to share their scepticism about the tests cited.
What they purport to gauge has too many dimensions to be mapped at all
simply.
That much is yet better illustrated by another test based on the notion that
creativity equates with the capacity to spawn novel ideas. Hence candidates
are asked how many uses they can think of for a builder's brick or the like.
One attendant snag was pointed out by an erstwhile user, a top recruiting
specialist in an outfit then employing half a million. 'We find some people
can produce far more than others. But as the quantity increases, the nearer
they seem to get to being psychopaths. For example, some of the uses they
come up with aren't just obscene, but sadistic. Is that creativity . . .and
even if it is, do you want it in your organisation?'
The root answer is that it isn't. Far from meeting all four conditions set
out earlier, a bent for spawning novel ideas might be incongruent with the
discipline needed to achieve effective and valuable results. In the words of
the American authorities on the topic, James Averill and Elma Nunley*: 'We
must distinguish the creative from the bizarre, the merely eccentric, the
random - all of which can be quite novel or unique.'
Moreover they go on to question the very basis of the tests I've mentioned.
It is the notion that creative people think in a special way which differs
from the mental workings of the more prosaic, thinking intuitively or
synthetically as opposed to analytically or discursively.
'We believe the bulk of the evidence favors those who deny a special process
approach,' the Americans say. 'The same thought processes, whether intuitive
or discursive, are important in all behavior, albeit perhaps in different
combination and degree. There is nothing special about creativity in this
regard.'
Nor do they think it dependent solely on mental mechanisms. Motivation also
plays an essential role. 'People are often motivated to do what they are
able to do,' the authors add.
'Motives help determine mechanisms. Within limits, a person who wants to do
something can, through hard work and practice, develop the relevant
abilities. There are, of course, limits. Not everyone can be an Einstein or
a Beethoven, no matter how hard he works. But the limits are less severe
than we like to think. . . . . It follows that everyone has the ability to
some degree.'
There is something else that follows too. It's epitomised by a pet question
of that giant of motivational theory, Fred Herzberg. 'What's the most vital
thing to do if you want your daughter to be a great pianist?', it went.
Then, dismissing replies about giving encouragement and such, he'd grin: 'No
 -make sure she has a piano to play on, for God's sake]'
His point would be confirmed by the pair from Ford. Their in-company studies
show that everybody's creativity is inhibited unless organisational power
structures are rigged not only to make it possible, but nurture it to boot.
Otherwise, even reliable creativity tests wouldn't be much help. The reason
(having dropped several eminent names already, I might as well drop another)
is enshrined in the philosopher Sir Karl Popper 's comment that the mere
fact that everyone in the world acted in line with logic would not make it a
logical world; just one filled with logical people. By the same token, an
organisation full of creative individuals won't necessarily be a creative
organisation.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Family doctors allowed to offer
more services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAMILY DOCTORS who manage their own budgets are to be allowed to provide a
wider range of services for their patients, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the
health secretary, announced in the Commons last night.
She said changes in existing regulations would enable them to undertake
diagnostic testing and minor surgical procedures outside the scope of their
current contracts without the need to form limited companies.
Mrs Bottomley dismissed Labour charges that the National Health Service was
'in crisis' and said provision had been made for a record capital allocation
of nearly Pounds 2bn in the coming financial year.
A Labour motion condemning the 'growing crisis' in the NHS and attacking the
commercialisation introduced by government reforms was defeated by 35 votes
(316-281).
Mrs Bottomley acknowledged concern over the action taken by some hospitals
to 'slow down' admissions for elective surgery because of pressure on their
budgets, but insisted that they should pace their activity more effectively
throughout the year.
She ruled out emergency allocations of additional funds, and called on
hospitals to meet the challenge of managing their annual budgets in a way
that ensured they were not exhausted after eight or nine months.
Mrs Bottomley also announced that, to reinforce the drive to cut the waiting
time for screening for breast cancer and other illnesses, Pounds 2m would be
made available for pump-priming 30 innovative 'pacesetter' projects
throughout the country.
The health secretary reaffirmed that the government would take 'tough
decisions' in formulating its response to the report by Sir Bernard
Tomlinson that recommended the closure or amalgamation of some London
hospitals.
Promising that change would not be imposed by 'central diktat', she admitted
that it would take time to correct the imbalance and distortions that had
grown up over many decades.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, claimed that with waiting lists
worsening and operations being cancelled there was a 'real crisis' in
hospitals.
In a renewed attack on the removal of hospitals from the control of area
health authorities through the conferment of trust status, he said they were
non-accountable and completely undemocratic.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Banks welcome survey of lending
practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH STREET banks yesterday welcomed the results of the Bank of England's
survey into their lending practices to small businesses, which was promised
by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
They could hardly do otherwise because the survey found that they had passed
on the whole of base rate cuts to borrowers.
The survey of seven high street banks with 4.1m accounts among businesses of
less than Pounds 10m annually found fees and charges had grown by an average
of just over 5 per cent since June 1991. But it found average margins hardly
changed in the same period.
Although the inquiry was expected to exonerate the banks of holding on to
the value of base rate cuts, the lack of any overall margin widening was a
surprise. The Bank found margin rises had averaged below 0.5 percentage
points.
Total lending to small businesses fell from Pounds 45bn to Pounds 43.6m over
the period. There was a 3 per cent fall in the amount of lending linked to
base rates and a 15 per cent increase to Pounds 6.3bn in fixed rate loans.
About a third of facilities had been increased, and a quarter reduced.
The Bank found most banks had passed on the 4.5 percentage point rate cut in
the period within two or three days of each cut. For firms with up to a
Pounds 1m turnover, average margins were between 2.3 and 4.2 per cent, while
for those between Pounds 1m and Pounds 10m turnover they were between 1.8
per cent and 3.8 per cent.
The banks - Barclays, NatWest, Lloyds, Midland, TSB, Bank of Scotland and
Royal Bank of Scotland - had shifted firms of above Pounds 1m turnover from
the lowest margin band of between 0 and 2 percentage points above base.
Those in the lowest band had fallen from 56 per cent to 35 per cent over the
period.
Overall, 61 per cent of base-rate-related accounts saw no change in margins.
Margins widened on 30 per cent of accounts, about half by less than 0.5 per
cent, and they narrowed on 9 per cent. 'Seven out of 10 customers seem to
have received the full benefit of base rate cuts or more,' the Bank found.
On fees and charges, the survey found that the average increase in income
was just over 5 per cent. This compared to inflation of 4.2 per cent over
the period, and a 7 per cent fall in the customer base from 4.4m in June
1991. The Bank comments on a 'more thorough-going attitude' to charging.
There was a strong divergence in fee charging. Two banks saw fee income fall
by a little less than the customer base, while increases in revenue for the
others ranged from 4 per cent to 22 per cent. The Bank says that tariffs are
reviewed annually.
The Bank found that a number of banks issued local managers with guidance on
target margins. In two cases the target minimum was increased by 0.5 per
cent and in one, a bank reduced its targets.
About two thirds of all small business accounts were in credit, and the
average amount borrowed for firms with a turnover below Pounds 1m is just
over Pounds 20,000. A one percentage point change in interest rates thus
benefits or penalises the average small business by about Pounds 200 per
year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD TAYLOR of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, last night added to the
pressure on the government to drop its proposals for removing the right of
would-be visitors to Britain to appeal to the courts if refused entry, Ivor
Owen writes.
His strong opposition was revealed by Lord Woolf, another law lord, during
the second reading debate on the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill in the
House of Lords. Lord Woolf explained that Lord Taylor, who was unable to
attend the debate, had authorised him to express his concern over the
'draconian' removal of the right of appeal.
Lord Woolf said 'His view is the same as mine - that an inevitable
consequence of the present proposals if they are enacted is that they will
lead to a substantial increase in the number of applications for judicial
review'.
Claims made by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, that removal of the
right of appeal from would-be visitors would enable cases concerning those
seeking permanent settlement to be dealt with more quickly and efficiently
were disputed by Lord Donaldson, the former master of the rolls.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs agree plan to save up to 19
pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CROSS-PARTY trade and industry committee last night agreed a unanimous
report on the future of the coal industry, designed to rescue between 16 and
19 pits.
After several hours' tough negotiations, the committee agreed a blueprint
believed to create a market for the consumption of an additional 16m tonnes
of domestic coal annually, with the possibility of another 3m to follow.
But the announcement left a question mark over the exact consequences for
each of the 31 threatened coal mines. The committee will not publish its
final report until Friday.
Leaving the last of the day's four negotiating sessions just before 11pm, Mr
Richard Caborn, committee chairman, described the talks as 'difficult' and
said he felt 'bloody knackered'.
'We have had three simple questions: is there a larger market for coal; if
so how large; and how do you get to it,' he said. The report, he added,
would be 'very, very detailed'.
Last night's hard bargaining focused on the size of the extra market for
domestic coal that could be justified and details of the restructuring
measures that should be recommended to achieve it.
Labour MPs had been holding out for a blueprint that would allow an extra
20m tonnes - equivalent to saving 20 or 21 pits - to be produced above a
planned output of 40m in the year beginning in April this year.
Some of the Labour group, reluctant to be associated with a report that
sealed the fate of any pits, were also pressing for the remaining 10 to 11
mines to be kept going in the short term on a 'rape and pillage' basis,
under which accessible seams would be plundered as cheaply as possible
without worrying about long-term prospects.
The Conservative camp, meanwhile, with a majority on the committee, had
argued that a case could be made for an additional market of only 15m tonnes
 -equivalent to 15 pits. This, it is widely suggested, would be enough to
satisfy sufficient prospective Tory rebels to protect the government's
21-strong Commons majority.
Though the future of the pits does not rest with the committee alone, its
findings will be a strong influence on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, as he prepares his own solution to the controversy which
began with the announcement of the closures last October.
Mr Heseltine used an appearance on BBC television yesterday to emphasise
that subsidies to British Coal would fall in the year ahead no matter how
the UK energy market was reorganised.
'We are subsidising British Coal today to the tune of Pounds 1bn a year,' Mr
Heseltine said.
'If they are to find a larger market there will need to be some form of
subsidy, but it would be a smaller subsidy than that which we are paying
today; the issue is how much smaller and over what period.'
In the Commons, Mr John Smith chose coal as his theme for prime minister's
questions. He said it was 'little short of astonishing that even now
ministers do not accept the crisis arises from the botched privatisation of
the electricity industry and not from any weakness in the British mining
industry'.
Roared on by backbenchers, the Labour leader said coal's crisis arose
directly from the 'rigging' of the energy market and urged the government to
accept that reform of the market to allow coal to compete fairly was 'the
crucial and overriding issue'.
'What both the industry and the nation needs is not some short-term fix to
save the government's face, but reform of the electricity market to allow
British miners to compete fairly,' Mr Smith said.
Standing in for prime minister John Major, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the
Commons, retorted that the coal sector's problems stemmed rather from a
long-term decline in demand for its products. He said Mr Heseltine's review
would be 'very thorough' and would not simply look at the short term.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour faces tough cash choices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S national executive must today grasp the nettle of falling
membership and income by voting on the deepest organisational cutbacks in
the party's 93-year history.
The retrenchment involves plans to curb expenditure and manpower by about a
third, leading to some 30 job losses out of its 120-strong Walworth Road
headquarters staff and the closure of up to five of the 11 regional offices.
Under plans submitted by Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, the
executive must attempt to find savings of some Pounds 4m a year from a
general fund budget of Pounds 12m.
Some NEC members are fighting hard to ensure that the regional cuts are
limited while others have battled to keep enough critical mass in the
Walworth Road policy research department to maintain a viable service to
local government, constituencies and unions.
Lobbying is believed to have ensured that some cuts in the policy department
have been reversed in a revised plan for Walworth Road due to be formally
submitted for debate by the general secretary today.
However, the overall impact of the proposed reforms will serve to bolster Mr
John Smith's efforts to integrate more closely the activities of the party's
headquarters with those of his own leader's office at Westminster.
That process has been continuing apace under Mr Smith's seven-month tenure
of the party leadership. It is further confirmed by his decision to
redesignate Mr David Hill, the campaigns and communications' chief, as
overall party spokesman.
The change will release Mr Hill to oversee an integrated media management
operation which encompasses servicing the interests of the leader, the
shadow cabinet, the parliamentary party and the NEC. That move is expected
to receive formal approval at today's meeting.
Similarly, with the squeeze on manpower now taking hold, more work is
expected to be handled by integrated NEC/shadow cabinet working groups,
thereby avoiding duplication of effort.
Some senior party figures and unions have expressed misgivings that the
traditional division of power between the NEC, representing the national
party, and the parliamentary party is being eroded.
Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary and an NEC member, underlined
at a meeting in December that it was imperative local parties maintained
access to a source of data and research.
Furthermore, as a former leader of Sheffield council, Mr Blunkett has argued
strongly for Labour's local government conference to be exempt from a plan
to save money by putting most annual conferences on a biennial basis.

THE Government will consider legislation to outlaw smoking in public places

The Health of the Nation white paper set targets of no-smoking policies in
80 per cent of public places by 1994 and for most employees by 1995.
In a Commons written reply, Dr Mawhinney said: 'Good progress is being made
by voluntary means, but if this does not continue we will consider taking

FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Aid for special projects suspended
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, announced in the Commons last night
that aid provided for special projects under the Industrial Development Act
would be suspended until April 1995.
Labour MPs accused him of 'sneaking through' the announcement during a
debate on the provision of up to Pounds 20m to enable the Swedish
paper-making company SCA to invest in a newspaper recy-cling plant at
Aylesford, Kent.
Mr Sainsbury said it was intended to suspend the operation of the assistance
for special projects facility from the end of February.
MPs approved an order authorising sums exceeding Pounds 10m but not Pounds
20m towards the cost of installing new machinery and refurbishing existing
machinery to manufacture newsprint from recycled fibre at Aylesford.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Efforts to avert split on energy
report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN COOK, the shadow trade and industry spokesman, meets the energy
committee of the Trades Union Congress this afternoon hoping to avert a
labour movement split over the all-party report on the future of the coal
industry, David Goodhart writes.
Mr Roger Lyons, leader of the MSF white collar union and committee chairman,
said last night that the committee hoped to 'synchronise' its position with
Mr Cook.
However, led by the mining unions, the committee is likely to reject the
report if it reprieves only 20 of the 31 pits. Mr Lyons said yesterday: 'We
do not expect 10 or 15 pits to be written off just because the government
does not have an energy policy.'
The rejection of such a compromise would lead to differences with most of
the Labour MPs on the trade and industry committee, which is producing the
coal industry report.
Rejection might also be followed by calls from the National Union of
Mineworkers for industrial action to save all pits. That could open up
further differences between unions prepared to support a 'maximalist'
position with action and the majority, which will be reluctant to do so.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs divided over fate of coal pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of the 31 threatened coal pits was still in the balance last night
as MPs preparing a cross-party report on the industry battled behind closed
doors to agree a rescue.
Amid rising tension between some Tory and Labour members, the Commons trade
and industry committee was still struggling late last night towards a
compromise package that could save between 15 and 20 pits.
Last night's hard bargaining focused on the size of the extra market for
domestic coal that could be justified and details of the restructuring
measures that should be recommended to achieve it. The committee aims to
publish its final report on Friday.
Labour MPs were holding out for a blueprint that would allow an extra 20m
tonnes - equivalent to saving 20 or 21 pits - to be produced above a planned
output of 40m in the year beginning in April this year. That would probably
require a first-year subsidy of Pounds 380m, or more than Pounds 6 a tonne.
Some of the Labour group, reluctant to be associated with a report that
sealed the fate of any pits, were also pressing for the remaining 10 to 11
mines to be kept going in the short term on a 'rape and pillage' basis,
under which accessible seams would be plundered as cheaply as possible
without worrying about long-term prospects.
The Conservative camp, meanwhile, was arguing that a case could be made for
an additional market of only 15m tonnes - equivalent to 15 pits. This, it is
widely suggested, would be enough to satisfy sufficient prospective Tory
rebels to protect the government's 21-strong Commons majority.
Though the future of the pits does not rest with the committee alone, its
findings - if it can agree a unanimous report - will be a strong influence
on Mr Michael Heseltine as he prepares his own solution to the controversy
which began with the announcement of the closures last October.
The trade and industry secretary used an appearance on BBC television
yesterday to emphasise that subsidies to British Coal would fall in the year
ahead no matter how the UK energy market was re-organised.
'We are subsidising British Coal today to the tune of Pounds 1bn a year,' Mr
Heseltine said.
'If they are to find a larger market there will need to be some form of
subsidy, but it would be a smaller subsidy than that which we are paying
today; the issue is how much smaller and over what period.'
In the Commons, Mr John Smith chose coal as his theme for prime minister's
questions. He said it was 'little short of astonishing that even now
ministers do not accept the crisis arises from the botched privatisation of
the electricity industry and not from any weakness in the British mining
industry'.
Roared on by backbenchers, the Labour leader said coal's crisis arose
directly from the 'rigging' of the energy market and urged the government to
accept that reform of the market to allow coal to compete fairly was 'the
crucial and overriding issue'.
'What both the industry and the nation needs is not some short-term fix to
save the government's face, but reform of the electricity market to allow
British miners to compete fairly,' Mr Smith said.
Standing in for prime minister John Major, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the
Commons, retorted that the coal sector's problems stemmed rather from a
long-term decline in demand for its products.
Mr Doug Hoyle, Labour MP for Warrington North, said that any energy review
should not look at short term market forces but at future demand for coal,
which would become increasingly competitive.
Mr Newton said Mr Heseltine's review would be 'very thorough' and would not
simply look at the short term.
'It is taking account of reports by committees of the House and wide ranging
reports by independent consultants.' The results would be announced 'in due
course as appropriate'.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Dilemma over dealing with City cases: Efforts to find a
solution to long, complicated trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUESTION of whether cases such as the Blue Arrow fraud trial should have
been dealt with by the criminal courts or by the City regulators was central
to the Bar working party's efforts to find a solution to the problems of
long fraud trials.
The Blue Arrow trial, which ended last February, lasted a year and four
days. Four men were convicted of conspiracy to defraud after the 1987 Pounds
873m failure of the Blue Arrow rights issue - the convictions were quashed
on appeal.
'Certainly the Stock Exchange felt at the time it could have dealt with it
more effectively and speedily. Hopefully Blue Arrow was a one-off,' says Mr
Jeremy Roberts QC, chairman of the working party.
Criminal offences involving fraud or financial irregularity embrace an
enormous range of degrees of culpability. At one extreme there are blatant
cases of dishonesty, which Mr Roberts says should always be dealt with by
the criminal courts.
At the other end of the scale are a variety of offences, many of a technical
nature, where the defendant has 'broken the rules', but neither desired nor
expected that anyone else would lose money.
The Bar believes there is a strong argument that many such offences would be
better dealt with in some other way than devoting a large amount of public
time and money to a criminal prosecution. The problem is how to decide which
cases can be left to City regulators and which cases must be dealt with by
the courts.
It suggests that the solution hinges on the likely penalty for the offence.
If there is a risk that the accused will be sent to prison if convicted, the
case should be dealt with by the courts. If the likely outcome is a fine, a
conditional discharge or some other non-custodial sentence, the case ought
normally to be dealt with by disciplinary proceedings. This risk should be
assessed in discussion between City regulators and the Serious Fraud Office.
Mr Roberts accepts that allowing City regulators to deal with City offences
may be perceived by the public as a 'soft option' for the accused. The
accusation might be levelled that 'shoplifters go to prison; white-collar
criminals don't'
But the Bar believes the penalties disciplinary tribunals can impose are
quite stringent. Infringement of City rules can result in financial
penalties, suspension or termination of membership of a professional or self
regulatory body and an order to compensate the victims of any financial
irregularity.
City disciplinary systems are also capable of reaching a much speedier
resolution. An examination of cases dealt with by the Securities and Futures
Association shows that in most cases the delay between the commencement of
an investigation and conclusion of the case is between two and four months.
It has taken seven years to reach the end of the prosecutions arising out of
the 1986 Guinness takeover of Distillers.
But the Bar accepts that, to reassure the public, steps will have to be
taken to make City disciplinary proceedings more transparent. While
plea-bargaining and disciplinary proceedings continue to be held in private,
it will be very difficult to ensure public confidence in them. The onus is
on the City to address this problem.
The Bar also recommends that the Serious Fraud Office and the Crown
Prosecution Service have the power to 'compound' - to agree, in suitable
cases, to accept a financial penalty as an alternative to bringing criminal
charges. The Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise currently have this
power.
In many cases, compounding might be the most effective way of obtaining
recompense for the victims of fraud, Mr Roberts says.
Recent lengthy financial trials include:
GUINNESS 1: three men were jailed and a fourth fined for offences of theft,
conspiracy to defraud and false accounting arising out of the 1986 Pounds
2.72bn Guinness takeover of Distillers. The trial lasted six months.
BRITANNIA THEME PARK: the UK's longest criminal trial started in September
1990 and ended in February 1992. Four men were jailed and a fifth was fined
over the 1985 collapse of the Britannia Theme Park at Shipley, Derbyshire,
with debts of Pounds 9.34m.
BARLOW CLOWES: almost a year ago Mr Peter Clowes was jailed for theft and
fraud after the Pounds 150m collapse of his investment company Barlow
Clowes. The trial lasted seven months.
BLUE ARROW: four men were convicted of conspiracy to defraud after the 1987
Pounds 873m failure of the Blue Arrow rights issue in a trial of a year and
four days. The convictions were quashed on appeal.
GUINNESS 2: the trial was abandoned last February after five months because
of the ill-health of one of the two defendants, former merchant banker Mr
Roger Seelig.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Accountancy rule adoption 'slow'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES are proving slow to adopt the new accounting standard on profit
and loss accounts, according to Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based
monthly monitoring service of annual reports.
Just six companies - 4 per cent of those issuing annual reports in the 11
weeks since FRS 3 standard was circulated in late October - have adopted its
guidance.
That compares with 16 companies, or 10 per cent, which adopted FRS 1, the
other principal accounting standard, in the same period after its
publication. FRS 1 was introduced in September 1991 and deals with cashflow.
Mr Iain Martin of Company Reporting said adoption might be slower because
'people are not so sure about whether it is a good thing'. He said FRS 1 was
welcomed as an improvement on the old source and application of funds
statement.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Insolvency body plan in dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR a joint regulatory body for insolvency practitioners are being
held up by a dispute over its control.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which regulates
nearly half of UK practitioners, wants more than a proposed three out of 11
voting shares on the Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit.
Discussions are well advanced for the creation of the unit, which would be
supported by the principal professional insolvency bodies - the three UK
chartered accountancy institutes, the certified accountants and Institute of
Practitioners of Insolvency.
Plans for the unit, which would be registered as a limited company, were
generated by pressure from the Department of Trade and Industry. It believes
on the basis of random inspections last year that monitoring of
practitioners was not rigorous enough.
It would inspect all the UK's 2,000 insolvency practitioners every three to
five years.
Meanwhile the DTI is likely to hand to the Insolvency Practitioners'
Association control of the registration and supervision of about 150
individuals who fall outside the bodies recognised in the 1986 Insolvency
Act. The government's insolvency service, which is under financial pressure,
sees the move as a logical development of the self-regulatory regime.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Council launches policy on racial equality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES supplying Newcastle upon Tyne City Council with goods or services
will be barred from using informal recruitment methods and will have to
advertise all vacancies under a scheme for racial equality in employment
launched today.
The policy, which the council insists will benefit companies by encouraging
good management practice, will also oblige all its contractors to have a
written racial equality policy statement and to monitor how many employees
are from ethnic minorities.
Those responsible for recruitment in businesses employing more than 25
people will have to undergo racial equality training at their company's
expense. Those employing more than 250 people will be required to take
positive action to encourage applications if detailed monitoring discloses
under-representation of any ethnic group.
The council, which spends more than Pounds 100m a year with contractors,
believes the scheme is necessary to give equal chance of employment for all
its residents. Newcastle's ethnic minorities total 4.1 per cent of the
population.
Council legal advisers are satisfied the scheme does not exceed powers
available under the 1976 Race Relations Act and 1988 Local Government Act.
The council says it is demanding no more than companies should already be
doing under the law.
Companies bidding for work, including the 600 on the standing list, will
have to answer six questions satisfactorily, laid down by the environment
secretary in 1988, on their racial equality policy and practice. Once
awarded a contract, they must then satisfy the council's own more stringent
conditions. Any which fail to do so cannot be forced to forfeit the
contract, but will be barred from further tendering.
The Association of Metro-politan Authorities and the Commission for Racial
Equality believe the scheme is the first of its kind.
Mr Bob Tilmouth, chief executive of the Tyne and Wear Chamber of Commerce,
said: 'The basic principles of racial equality and fairness are not in
dispute at all but there are aspects of the bureaucracy implied behind this
which will cause companies some concern when they're under pressure from the
recession.'
The council has also floated proposals for the creation by the British
Standards Institute of a standard for open employment principles.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Insurers given credit for fall in ships lost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of ships being lost at sea is falling thanks to pressure from
insurers on owners of older ships to improve safety standards, marine
underwriters said yesterday.
Figures issued by the Institute of London Underwriters show that 111 ships
were lost last year compared with 182 in 1991 and 144 in 1990. Tonnage lost
fell to 1.08m tons compared with 1.74m in 1991 and 1.36m in 1990.
The total cost to insurers will exceed Dollars 500m (Pounds 330m), though
final figures are not yet available.
The institute, in its annual commentary on the marine insurance market, said
the fall reflected a vigorous campaign by insurers against 'older, unsafe
tonnage'.
Underwriters have begun to discriminate against 'sub-standard' ships by
making insurance dependent on owners carrying out thorough structural
surveys of their vessels and implementing recommended changes.
Insurers are also charging additional premiums for cargo carried in older
vessels.
More than 85 per cent of all ships lost last year were more than 15 years
old, with tankers and bulk carriers particularly vulnerable.
The institute said the value of passenger vessel and ferry losses could
'finally prove to be the highest for some years'.
The figures also indicate that ships flying so-called 'flags of convenience'
tend to sink more easily. Just under a third of the total tonnage lost was
registered in Panama, for example.
The fall in claims has been accompanied by a rise in premium rates as
insurers respond to their losses of recent years, leading to a recovery in
the marine insurance market.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Unit trust funds at record Pounds 63.88bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUNDS UNDER management in the unit trust industry reached a record high of
Pounds 63.88bn at the end of last year,even though investors made net
repurchases in December, Philip Coggan writes.
Strong stock markets pushed up the figure, which compares with Pounds
55.15bn at the end of 1991.
The Unit Trust Association said December's net repurchase figure of Pounds
24m came after a change in the tax position of life companies. Some life
companies previously found it convenient to hold investments in their unit
trust subsidiaries. Tax changes have forced them to switch holdings into
directly-managed funds.
Private investors are still buying unit trusts. Net sales to them were
Pounds 93m in December - the most popular sectors were UK equity income and
money markets - as society rates fell.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Investment of Pounds 19m to expand Humber ports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUMBER ports are to get more than Pounds 19m of investment to cope with
growing demand from European traffic across the North Sea, Ian Hamilton
Fazey writes.
Most of the investment will go on an Pounds 18m extension of the Immingham
oil terminal, announced yesterday, which is used by oil company Conoco for
its Humber refinery, and Total and Fina for their adjacent and jointly-owned
Lindsey refinery.
A smaller investment of Pounds 1.2m in the Port of Hull, to restore inner
and outer lock gates at Alexandra Dock, will have a wider impact on general
cargoes. The dock was closed in 1981 because overmanning made it
uncompetitive with non-unionised wharves further up the Humber estuary.
Associated British Ports, the owner, decided to spend Pounds 2m reopening it
on trial two years ago, after the government's abolition of the National
Dock Labour Scheme in 1989 enabled lower staffing levels to be achieved.
ABP has funded the Hull investment alone but is sharing its Immingham jetty
development costs with Conoco, which will contribute Pounds 4m. Mr Alan
Hodson, who runs the Conoco refinery, said the new jetty was needed to cope
with growing export traffic.
The new berth should open in April next year, the 25th anniversary of the
commissioning of the terminal. Construction will be undertaken by Amec Civil
Engineering.
ABP owns the ports of Immingham, Grimsby, Hull and Goole.

FT  27 JAN 93 / SIB is told to reduce demands on new unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Invest-ments Board will have to soften its demands for
strengthening the planned Personal Investment Authority if it is to earn the
acceptance of the industry, Sir Gordon Downey, chairman of Fimbra, the
self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers, warned yesterday.
Sir Gordon, who is also chairman of the new authority's board, said he
broadly welcomed a recent letter from SIB's chairman, Mr Andrew Large,
stating that the authority would not be approved unless it delivered
significantly better investor protection.
However, several points raised by Mr Large would require negotiation, he
said. 'Whether we (the authority's board) can reach agreement is anybody's
guess. And even if the board members can agree among themselves, they will
still need the support of the 75 per cent majorities of Lautro (the
self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry) and Fimbra members.
This is no easy task.'
In particular, Sir Gordon questioned whether independent financial advisers
should, as Mr Large has said, be required to have Pounds 10,000 in capital
in order to be allowed to operate.
Fimbra members have objected to the requirement, and the industry trade
association estimates that such a rule could put 50 per cent to 60 per cent
of independent advisers out of business. Mr Ken Bignall, managing director
of Barclays Financial Services and a member of the authority's board, said
the new tougher standards proposed by Mr Large go a long way towards
satisfying some of his concerns about joining the body.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Safety on railways shows improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIL safety continued its long-term improvement last year in spite of some
well-publicised accidents such as the one at London's Cannon Street station,
the Health and Safety Executive said yesterday.
Although the number of fatalities in train crashes rose from four to 11, the
total of so-called significant train accidents - potentially the most
dangerous to passengers - fell from 161 to 131.
Total fatalities, including people hit by moving trains or falling from
them, rose from 84 to 94. In addition, 242 trespassers and suicides died, a
fall from 285 the year before.
Mr Robin Seymour, chief inspecting officer of railways, announced that the
executive was to study driver behaviour in regard to level crossing warning
lights.

FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Mortgage lenders concerned about savers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVERS rather than borrow-ers seemed to be the main concern of banks and
building societies after yesterday's base rate cut.
Instead of greeting the rate with optimistic forecasts of the effect on the
housing market, lenders emphasised the consequences for savers.
Bristol &amp; West, the tenth-largest building society, did not even mention the
housing market in its comments. It said: 'Today's fall in base rates will be
disappointing for savers who have seen their returns fall dramatically over
the past 12 months.' Those lenders that announced new mortgage rates are not
passing on the full cut to borrowers.
The new market rate appears to be 7.99 per cent, down from the previous
industry standard of 8.55 per cent.
Halifax, the largest society, was the first to signal to the market that it
would be cutting its mortgage rate by just over half a percentage point.
This would result in a monthly saving of Pounds 19.83 for someone with a
Pounds 50,000 endowment mortgage.
The society, which has 15m savings accounts and 1.8m borrowers, said it had
given 'special consideration' to its savers in setting the new mortgage rate
of 7.99 per cent (down from 8.55 per cent). The rate would apply immediately
for new borrowers and from March 1 for existing loans.
The new rate will be taken into account for the 1.3m of its borrowers who
are on annual review. They will see a reduction in their mortgage rate from
10.95 per cent to 7.99 per cent after Halifax's year end on Sunday.
Halifax will cut savings rates but was not yet ready to announce by how
much.
Reductions in savings rates contributed to building societies suffering net
outflows in five months last year. Net building society receipts for the
year totalled only Pounds 295m last year compared with Pounds 5.8bn in 1991
and Pounds 6.6bn in 1990.
The Consumers' Association said yesterday that while it was disappointed
that mortgage rates had not been cut more, it was more concerned with the
delay in implementation of the new rates for existing borrowers. Mr Grame
Jacobs of the association said: 'We believe they could implement the cuts
sooner than six weeks whatever the administrative problems. If they are
delaying doing so to widen their margins, they should come clean and say
so.'
Abbey National, Lloyds Bank, Nationwide, Northern Rock, Chelsea and TSB all
announced cuts in their mortgage rates to 7.99 per cent. Abbey National and
Nationwide have made mortgages cheaper on larger loans.
The new rates take effect at Abbey National from today for new borrowers and
from March 1 for existing borrowers. Abbey National said it had not passed
on the full reduction because it was bearing the interests of savers in
mind.
Cuts in savings rates are likely to take effect well before the
implementation of the new rate for existing borrowers at most societies on
March 1. Nationwide, however, promised savers that they would not see a
reduction in rates until March 1, when its mortgage rate falls for existing
borrowers. The lower rate will come into effect for new borrowers tomorrow.
Lloyds Bank said its new rates would apply to all borrowers from February
26.
Alliance and Leicester, the fourth largest society, welcomed the cut but
said its timing was a surprise. Mr Peter White, chief executive, said: 'We
are looking at the effect this cut will have on rates for our customers,
remembering that there are around six times as many savers as borrowers.'
Woolwich said new savings rates would have to be 'very carefully balanced'
to ensure a competitive return.

FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Builders and estate agents encouraged -
House sales boost forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDERS and estate agents yesterday welcomed the cut in interest rates and
said it should encourage the recent resurgence in house sales.
'A four-bedroom house in Islington put on the market at more than Pounds
200,000 in January 1990 received an agreed offer of just under Pounds 170,00
on Monday,' said Mr Tony Copping Joyce, senior partner at central and north
London agents Copping Joyce.
'A flat in Canonbury in north London on offer at Pounds 120,000 in March
1991 has just sold for Pounds 105,000.'
He said those were examples of properties which had remained on the market
for several years and were now beginning to sell. 'This does not mean that a
sustained recovery is under way but I do believe that the bottom may have
been reached,' he added.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at stockbrokers UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew, said that the base rate cut was larger and earlier than had
been expected.
As a result, he said, house prices might even start to rise during the
second half of this year. Previously he had forecast a further 5 per cent
reduction in prices this year, but now expects them to remain flat over the
12 months.
House sales, which had slumped from a peak of 2m in 1988 to just 1m last
year, could be between 1.25m and 1.3m this year according to Phillips &amp;
Drew.
The number of potential buyers visiting show houses and estate agents and
building societies' offices has jumped since the end of November following
one of the worst-ever autumns for house sales.
Some of the improvement may to be due to buyers reviving purchases postponed
during the September sterling crisis when interest rates fluctuated wildly.
According to the country's 30 largest estate agents, which account for half
of all house transactions, agreed sales rose by 18 per cent last month
compared with December 1991.
Most encouraging has been the increased interest from buyers in southern
England where prices have fallen by up to 30 per cent since 1989.
Mr William Wells, partner of Mullucks in Hertfordshire said: 'In the first
few weeks of this year we sold several homes for more than Pounds 300,000
when the market for this price bracket was dead last year.'
Mr John Cowley, a partner of Crisp Cowley in Bath, said that activity during
December - normally a poor month for sales - and January was between a fifth
and a quarter higher than during the corresponding months a year earlier.
'A sign of the times is that an increasing number of clients who have been
renting have told us that they are unlikely to renew their leases and that
they judge that now is the best time to return to buying,' Mr Cowley said.
Housebuilders, too, have reported a sharp increase in visitors and sales
since the end of November. They warn, however, that there was a similar
uplift in sales at the beginning of last year.
Mr Richard Andrew, chief executive of Wimpey's homes division, welcomed
yesterday's interest rate reductions as 'well-timed and necessary'.
'Whilst we are seeing flickers of renewed interest, there are still many
house buyers who lack confidence,' he added. 'Let us hope this is just the
right stimulus to encourage those who have been hesitating.'

FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Gilts marketmakers protest - Timing
upsets some dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING gilt-edged market-makers clashed with the Bank of England over the
timing of yesterday's cut in interest rates. They said it caused disorderly
conditions in the market and cost them about Pounds 25m.
The marketmakers are a group of about 20 big international investment
groups. The four biggest are SG Warburg Securities, Greenwell Montagu, UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew and Barclay de Zoete Wedd.
The groups are upset that the rate cut came just before today's auction by
the Bank of Pounds 2.5bn of 8.5 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 2007.
Many marketmakers had already sold large quantities of the stock at
relatively low prices to clients such as pension funds.
The investment groups were dismayed that yesterday's events, which triggered
a 1 point jump in gilt prices, will leave them having to buy stock at
significantly higher prices at the auction.
There was particular concern in the market that the Bank's move in cutting
rates, made in accordance with instructions from the Treasury, may have
soured Threadneedle Street's relationship with the marketmakers ahead of a
big programme of gilt issues.
The Bank will probably need to issue Pounds 1bn of gilts a week in 1993-94
to pay for Britain's large public sector deficit.
A Bank official said: 'There is no way we can guarantee not to cut interest
rates the day before an auction.'

FT  27 JAN 93 / Tourist authority chief quits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR William Davis, chairman of the British Tourist Authority and the English
Tourist Board, said yesterday he was leaving both jobs and attacked the
government for not doing enough to assist the tourist industry.
Mr Davis said he had told Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary,
that he did not want to continue in the two posts when his three-year term
of office ended on March 31. Mr Davis said he had not been offered another
three-year term and Mr Brooke did not try to dissuade him from leaving.
Mr Davis criticised the government for cutting the ETB's grant from Pounds
15.6m last year to Pounds 9.1m in 1995. 'The cuts in the ETB budget herald
the demise of the ETB,' he said.
Mr Davis, a former journalist, said he would devote more time to his
magazine publishing company.
The Department of National Heritage said yesterday Mr Davis's term was due
to end on March 31 and 'it is not normal practice to automatically extend
appointments. An announcement will be made soon about his successor.'
Mr Michael Medlicott, BTA chief executive, is also leaving the authority to
become European vice president of Delta Air Lines, the US carrier. He said
his departure was unrelated to that of Mr Davis.
Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways, will also leave the
BTA board at the end of this month when his term ends. He said yesterday
that after seven years on the board it was time for fresh blood.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Pounds 20bn tax rise by late 1990s, warns institute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK faces the possibility of tax increases totalling Pounds 20bn over the
next few years, according to a report published yesterday by the Institute
for Fiscal Studies, a research group, in collaboration with US investment
bank Goldman Sachs.
The study says the extra taxes are needed to combat a 'dramatic worsening'
in the UK's finances, mainly brought about by extra social security spending
and lower tax income triggered by the recession.
As a tax increase in the March 16 Budget would put at risk tentative signs
of recovery, the government will probably delay any fiscal tightening until
this year's December Budget, which applies to 1994-95 and is part of a new
Treasury system for planning fiscal policy and public spending at the same
time.
The IFS/Goldman Sachs study - called the Green Budget - says the government
is likely in December to start clawing back the deficit through tax
increases of Pounds 5bn to Pounds 6bn. That could be done by increasing
national insurance contributions and by extending the scope of value added
tax.
If VAT were levied on all items - such as food - which are zero rated, this
could raise as much as Pounds 11bn a year.
Other possibilities are 'environmental taxes' on carbon-based fuels, higher
taxes on savings such as pensions and the end of mortgage tax relief. The
Treasury is also likely to look at attracting more private money into
normally state-funded projects such as roads and railways.
The study says Mr Lamont should try to stimulate a recovery over the next
few months by looser monetary policy.
Once the recession has clearly ended, the government should start regaining
control of public finances through tax increases phased over two or three
years.
The IFS/Goldman Sachs team thinks the public sector borrowing requirement
will be Pounds 38bn in 1992-3, against Treasury projections of Pounds 37bn.
It may climb to about Pounds 54bn in 1993-94, significantly more than the
Treasury's Pounds 44bn estimate.
The study says assuming 3 per cent a year growth is achievable, the Treasury
should aim to reduce the PSBR to about 3 per cent of GDP by the mid to late
1990s. Because only modest public spending cuts are likely in this period,
that leaves most of the 'black hole' in public finances to be filled by a
tax increase of 3 per cent of GDP - about Pounds 20bn.

FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Currency dealers surprised - Sterling
falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SCALE and timing of yesterday's base rate cut took the currency market
by surprise and the pound sank more than 3 pfennigs yesterday morning,
bottoming out at DM2.4200.
The question on the mind of currency dealers, treasury managers and British
politicians is whether the pound will sink even further against the D-Mark
and the US dollar.
Mr Paul Chertkow, head of research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London,
believes that the pound will fall to the critical level of DM2.40 in the
next week and may test the record low of DM2.3693.
He believes the pound's fall will be checked if the Bundesbank cuts
short-term interest rates in the next few weeks - a move that would make the
German currency a less attractive short-term investment than other European
currencies.
There are doubts about when - and by how much - the Bundesbank will cut
rates. Mr Chertkow said: 'In the absence of a German rate cut in the order
of 200 basis points this year, the pound will go below its historic lows.'
A perception in the currency markets that there is no clear framework to UK
monetary policy may also undermine the pound in the next few weeks.
Mr Mark Brett, a currency analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, said
that dealers were uncertain over exactly which economic indicators were
driving policy.

FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Small businesses offer a cautious welcome
 -Low level of borrowing dulls impact on profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS OF small businesses welcomed yesterday's 1 percentage point cut in
the base rate more for the effect they hoped it would have on customer
confidence than for its immediate impact on their financing costs.
Lower interest charges will not have a significant impact on profits because
many businesses have made a determined effort to reduce their borrowings.
'The cut won't make a lot of difference to our bottom line because we have
used our overdraft facility frugally,' said Mr David Atkinson, company
accountant at Northern Tooling, a Wetherby-based company that reconditions
machine tools. 'But it will help our customers who have large overdrafts.'
Northern Tooling, with turnover of just over Pounds 1m, has an overdraft of
Pounds 120,000, well under its agreed limit of Pounds 160,000. Mr Atkinson
said that if the base rate cut did boost demand it planned to relaunch
investments in a new computer system, shopfloor equipment and vehicles for
its managers.
Many businesses have made themselves much less dependent on bank borrowings
or shifted from variable rate to fixed-rate loans to reduce their exposure
to changes in bank lending policies.
National Westminster Bank said only 20 per cent of business start-ups made
use of borrowings compared with 40 per cent a few years ago.
Norfolk Labels, a label printer to the food industry, uses finance houses to
fund its capital expenditure and, because it has good cashflow, maintains a
Pounds 250,000 deposit with its bank.
Mr Jack Parker, managing director, said: 'The banks have been very greedy in
the past and my attitude is to stay away from bank loans.'
The company recently spent Pounds 350,000 on new equipment using a five-year
fixed-rate loan carrying an APR of 11.25 per cent from a finance house. Mr
Parker said he was prepared to pay that rate because he expected interest
rates to rise in the next few years.
Mr Parker said one benefit of the base rate cut would be to improve the
disposable incomes of staff and make them more reconciled to the lower wage
rises or pay freezes that companies such as his have brought in during the
recession.
Norfolk labels has just agreed a pay freeze with its 25 employees.
In spite of the controversy that arose in 1991 about the high cost of bank
borrowings, the latest NatWest/Small Business Research Trust surveyshows
that the cost of finance now ranks only a poor third among the concerns of
managers.
Lack of business and difficulty in getting paid were the two main worries
with interest rates mentioned by just 9 per cent of companies surveyed.
NatWest said that half of its customers were continuously in credit and a
quarter were continuously overdrawn.
Mr Brian Woods-Scawen, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Birmingham, said
that a growing number of companies would not be affected because they had
been tied into fixed-rate loans with a minimum rate which had already been
reached.
National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank have minimum base rates of 6 per
cent. If base rates fall below that level businesses might find they do not
benefit, although NatWest has said it will keep its minimum rate under
re-view.
Other accountants who advise small businesses pointed out that some
businesses would be unable to increase their investments.
Mr Charles Burton, a partner in the Bradford office of Haines Watts, said:
'An interest rate cut is all fine and dandy as long as you can borrow money
in the first place. Very many small companies are already at their overdraft
limits and can get no more. Anyone who thinks the cut will change this
situation is whistling in the wind.'
Mr Charles Hatton, a partner in Moore Stephens at Southport, said: 'Let us
not lose sight of the fact that a 6 per cent base rate is still well above
the rate of inflation - and our clients are typically paying base plus
several more percentage points.
Mr Grahame Elliott, a senior partner in Stoy Hayward in Manchester, said: 'A
lot of my clients have decisions pending on capital projects, so the cut may
help them make up their minds. It's not the cut, but a consistent direction
that matters. If they believe rates will continue to fall, they may try to
borrow, but not if there is a chance of them rising again.'

FT  27 JAN 93 / Sex bias claim limit may be 'too low'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS could face increases in the size of compensation claims from
victims of sex discrimination because of a European Court of Justice case,
the Equal Opportunities Commission said yesterday.
Industrial tribunals in Britain are not allowed to award more than Pounds
10,000 in sex discrimination cases. The European Court was advised by the EC
advocate-general yesterday that an upper limit on compensation must allow
for 'adequate' compensation and cover: for example, any loss of income
suffered by the victims.
The EOC said that, on first reading of the opinion, it was 'highly
delighted'. It said: 'It looks as if the upper limit may in certain
circumstances offer inadequate compensation under EC law.'
The opinion also meant it was likely that individuals would be able to claim
interest on damages from the date the discrimination took place, rather than
from the time of the tribunal's ruling - as at present. The
advocate-general's view is likely to be adopted by the European Court and,
after further clarification, returned to the House of Lords. The issues of
industrial tribunal ceilings and interest payable arose from a long-running
case which was brought against Southampton Health Authority by a former
employee, Ms Helen Marshall.
The first cases which could be affected by a final European Court ruling
involve as many as 5,000 women dismissed by the armed services after
becoming pregnant.
In a test case involving two former military nurses, the government agreed
in the High Court in December 1991 that two women had been unlawfully
sacked, and agreed to pay compensation. The Armed Forces Pregnancy Dismissal
Group, which represents the women, said yesterday that some individual
claims might now exceed Pounds 100,000.

FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Retailers' responses mixed - Consumer
fillip expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE one point cut in base rates yesterday delighted retailers and
industrialists but left many economists doubtful about prospects for
inflation.
The reduction in borrowing rates should provide a fillip to consumer
spending by easing the burden of household debt but economists fear that
further depreciation of the pound and the resulting rise in import costs
will put upward pressure on inflation.
Mr John Clare, group managing director of Dixons, the UK's biggest
electrical retailer, said: 'We are very pleased with this latest cut in
rates. Our business has historically moved in line with interest rates and
we believe that lower rates are a prerequisite for getting the country out
of recession.'
But he was cautious about further reductions. 'It is also important for us
that the exchange rate is protected as far as possible, because we import a
lot of products and we are starting to see prices go up.'
His thoughts were echoed by Mr David Kern, chief economist at National
Westminster Bank. He said: 'The news is good but it entails a cost - higher
inflation and rates back up again by the end of the year.'
Retailers were divided about the extent of the benefit lower interest rates
would bring. Mr Nigel Whittaker, corporate affairs director of the
Kingfisher retail group, was less concerned about the price implications of
lower base rates.
'It is very good news. Even though there is some inflationary impetus from a
lower pound, there is such a weak level of demand that there is some
question as to whether higher import prices will get passed on,' he said.
At Ikea, the furniture group, Mr Jeff Dolin, finance director, said he was
not convinced that base rates of 6 per cent, rather than 7 per cent, would
make a big difference.
'It is welcome as a step in the right direction, but whether it will help
our business depends on whether it is enough to stimulate the housing
market,' Mr Dolin said.
Manufacturers also reacted differently. Mr Ken Minton, chief executive of
Laporte, the speciality chemicals group, said the rate cut came too late.
'It will make the situation for our German competitors even more
uncomfortable, but we won't be tempted to cut prices to gain market share,'
he said.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of ICI, said the cut in rates should improve
the investment climate in the UK and be helpful to British industry in its
efforts to recover from the recession.
The Engineering Employers' Federation gave a grudging welcome to the base
rate cut, repeating its warning that lower interest rates could simply lead
to a consumer boom without increases in exports and investment.
Mr Ian Thompson, economist at the federation, said: 'It isn't just a case of
getting spending going again. The economy needs restructuring so that
consumer spending grows more slowly and exports and investment grow more
rapidly.'
The news was greeted more sceptically by Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at
James Capel. He said: 'Interest rates have fallen from 15 per cent to 6 per
cent and still nothing is happen-ing.
'The government believes that chopping interest rates will generate a
recovery, but all the polls tell us that it is fear of unemployment which is
generating an impasse in the economy. Cutting rates won't necessarily help.'

FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Lamont details economic factors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANCELLOR issued the following statement:
Interest rates are set to meet the government's target of 1 to 4 per cent
inflation, as measured by the 12-month growth rate of the retail price index
excluding mortgage interest payments. There was a slight rise in this
measure of inflation in December, from 3.6 per cent to 3.7 per cent.
However, the latest information suggests that, notwithstanding the impact
still to come from the easing of policy undertaken in the autumn and the
recent more buoyant surveys of consumer and business confidence, a further 1
per cent reduction in short-term interest rates is consistent with the
necessary restraining influence on inflation. Indicators taken into account
include:
A fall in broad money in December, bringing annual growth in M4 below the
bottom of its monitoring range, and the continuing low level of bank
lending.
While M0 growth was quite strong in December, this has not been reflected as
expected in strength in retail sales, which fell by 0.7 per cent seasonally
adjusted in the month.
The rate of pay settlements has fallen appreciably over the autumn. Unit
wage costs in manufacturing fell in November, and in the latest three months
were just  1/2 per cent higher than a year earlier.
House prices have continued to fall following the cuts in interest rates in
the autumn, albeit much more slowly on average over the last two months.
Producer output price inflation (excluding food, drink and tobacco) was 2.4
per cent in November and December, the lowest since April 1969.
Manufacturers' input prices (excluding food, drink and tobacco) rose by 7
per cent between August and November (seasonally adjusted), but fell
marginally in December.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Record number of jobless seek mental help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECORD numbers of unemployed people are being referred by their doctors to
clinical psychologists, the British Psychological Society said yesterday.
The society said that in calculating the full costs of unemployment it was
essential to include the social costs of increased physical and mental
ill-health and the added reliance on the National Health Service and welfare
systems.
Dr Jenny Cozens, a lecturer at Leeds University and a clinical and
occupational psychologist, said that there was a two-year waiting list in
some areas to see a clinical psychologist.
She said there was an 'indisputable link' between unemployment and mental
stress. Psychologists in parts of the Midlands were being inundated with
requests for help because of the pit closure programmes.
Dr Dilys Davies, a clinical psychologist for North East Warwickshire Health
Authority, said the emotional impact of job loss on middle class men in
areas such as the south-east - worst hit by the recession - could be
devastating.
She said: 'They internalise it more than working class men and see it as a
personal failure. In working class communities where there is a history of
unemployment people do not take it as personally.'
Nevertheless she said unemployment was worse for poor people because
alternative work was more limited.
Mr Andrew Stephenson, aged 37, a security consultant who became unemployed
last August and a founder of Reaction, a self-help group in Sheffield, said:
'I felt isolated and I did not want to talk to my friends about it when I
lost my job.
'There was a lurking fear that because things change so quickly I would be
left behind if I did not get a job quickly. One does also deteriorate very
quickly if you just sit in front of the television.'

sales this year
</HEADLINE>

   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY's base rate cut should lead to 50,000 extra car sales this year
provided the chancellor does not introduce a tax-raising Budget in March,
the Retail Motor Industry Federation said last night, John Griffiths writes.
The rate cut came less than 24 hours after the federation, which represents
12,000 retail motor trade businesses, unveiled a pre-Budget submission
warning that without lower interest rates a forecast 5 per cent recovery in
new car sales to 1.67m this year could peter out.
The reduction was also given a cautious welcome by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders whose chief executive, former Tory MP Sir Hal
Miller, said that 'through his actions, the chancellor seems to be on our
side'.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Scotts water industry plans unpopular
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, is being urged to ignore widespread
opposition to the idea of privatising the water and sewerage industry in
Scotland and floating the industry as one or more companies on the Stock
Exchange.
Bell Lawrie White, the Edinburgh stockbroker, says the supposedly soft
option of franchising the management of the Scottish water industry to
private-sector companies would be just as unpopular as outright
privatisation, while being more complex and costly.
Political opposition to privatising the Scottish water industry has
intensified, with Strathclyde regional council saying it will put the
government's plans for the industry to a referendum of its 1.7m voters, once
they are finalised.
Bell Lawrie White was responding to a Scottish Office consultation paper
detailing options for the Scottish water and sewerage industries. Unlike
their counterparts in England and Wales, the Scottish industries are still
in the public sector.
The government says change is necessary because local government is being
reorganised and private-sector finance is desirable to help fund the
industry's heavy investment needs. Water privatisation in any form is
rejected not only by the opposition parties but by some Conservatives.
Recently the Scottish landowners' federation said it opposed the private
ownership of water.
Bell Lawrie White says creating one to three public limited companies
embracing the water industry and floating them on the Stock Exchange would
be seen by the public as a Scottish solution and would build on the
successful privatisation of the Scottish electricity companies.
The option of franchising water, under which the assets would be owned by a
new company limited by guarantee which franchised their operation to a
private company, would be unpopular because most potential franchisees would
be English or French rather than Scottish companies.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has appointed Mr Thomas Pickering, one of the State
Department's most senior and respected professional diplomats, to be US
ambassador to Moscow. He takes over from Mr Robert Strauss.
Mr Pickering is best known as President George Bush's ambassador to the
United Nations from 1989 to 1992, a post in which he won universal acclaim.
He will move from being ambassador to India and has served as ambassador to
Israel, Jordan, Nigeria and El Salvador.
The 61-year-old Mr Pickering was summoned from New Delhi to Little Rock
during the transition between the Bush and Clinton administrations, and was
assumed to be under consideration for the post of deputy secretary of state.
He is expected to work closely with Mr Strobe Talbott, the Time magazine
columnist appointed ambassador at large for the states of the former Soviet
Union.
The appointment of a professional diplomat to Moscow is expected to reassure
career State Department officials, who complain that more and more
ambassadorial posts go to amateurs whose sole qualifications are financial
contributions to election campaigns.
Mr Warren Christopher, the new Secretary of State, promised his staff this
week that he would not allow embassies to be bought in this fashion.

President Bill Clinton's first state of the union address will be delivered
on February 17, the White House announced yesterday, Jurek Martin reports
from Washington.
This will beat by a symbolic one day President Ronald Reagan's initial state
of the union message in 1981. Far more than last week's more spiritual
inaugural address, it will encompass legislative priorities at home and
external foreign policy objectives, though the fine print of Mr Clinton's
extensive list of domestic proposals is unlikely to be ready before
mid-March.
As part of the preparation, the president is taking his cabinet this weekend
to his Camp David retreat to debate policy options. On Monday he named his
wife Hillary Clinton to head the health-care reform task force.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Brazil's drug companies face anti-trust action

THE Brazilian government is to use anti-trust laws against pharmaceutical
companies in an effort to force down prices.
Mr Paulo Haddad, economy minister, yesterday began legal processes against
40 pharmaceutical companies accused of 'abusive price increases' on 150
products.
Mr Haddad claims that between March 1990 and November 1992 medicine prices
increased by 613 per cent above inflation. He said one company had increased
prices by 192,000 per cent compared to accumulated inflation of 26,687 per
cent.
Abifarma, the association of pharmaceutical companies, says that medicine
prices were under government control until last April and that they are
simply making up for past losses.
The 40 companies facing legal action have not been named but are believed to
include several leading multinationals. Foreign companies make up the lion's
share of Brazil's Dollars 4bn pharmaceutical industry.
Mr Ruy Coutinho, head of the economic defence department, blames the price
rises on the oligopolistic nature of the sector, where, for example, seven
multinationals control 87 per cent of the antibiotics market. Last year he
fined six multinationals Dollars 100,000 for repressing stocks to force up
prices.
The companies now have 15 days to send details of their cost structures to
the Justice Ministry. If it is proved that they are making 'arbitrary
profits' then they will have to adjust prices to levels set by the
government. In the meantime the government has decided to import 260
products.
'The central preoccupation of this government is protecting the consumer,'
said Mr Haddad. 'This is a legal and civilised way of doing so'.
However, analysts fear that the attempt to control pharmaceutical prices
might spread into other sectors as the government tries to contain
inflation, now running at 28 per cent a month.
President Itamar Franco began the so-called 'Medicine wars' in November by
complaining that recent price rises, including for his own ulcer cream, had
been excessive.
Mr Franco said yesterday: 'These companies are more troublesome than
children and when children are badly behaved we put them in play-pens.'

FT  27 JAN 93 / Explosive health costs likely to fuel deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US budget deficit is likely to reach Dollars 650bn (6.8 per cent of
gross domestic product) within a decade unless Congress and the White House
agree austerity measures, Mr Robert Reischauer, director the Congressional
Budget Office, an independent advisory body, said yesterday.
Sharp increases in the deficit towards the end of the decade - from the
present level of about Dollars 300bn (Pounds 197.3bn) - would mainly reflect
explosive growth of federal spending on health care.
Mr Reischauer, however, was pessimistic about the chances of health-care
reform generating significant budgetary savings before 2000.
This was because reforms were likely to extend insurance coverage to 35m
more people, improve the benefits provided under federal programmes and
raise reimbursement rates in the public sector, to bring them more closely
into line with private sector payments to doctors and hospitals.
He was more optimistic about short-term economic prospects. The economy had
entered a period of 'self-sustaining' growth, said Mr Reischauer, and would
expand at an annual rate of about 3 per cent over the next two years.
This would bring unemployment down to about 6.5 per cent by the end of 1994,
compared with 7.3 per cent today. Consumer prices were likely to increase at
an annual rate of only 2.75 per cent over the next few years.
Mr Reischauer was testifying before the Senate budget committee following
the release of the CBO's semi-annual economic forecast.
Committee members were sceptical about his forecast which implies employment
rising at a monthly rate of 200,000 over the next two years, much faster
than in the recent past.
Consumer confidence figures released yesterday showed the Conference Board
index fell slightly to 77 against 78.1 in December. The stabilising of
confidence does not imply economic weakness but suggests that some of the
surge at the end of last year was a temporary reaction to President Bill
Clinton's election victory.
Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, said yesterday that a Dollars
15bn-Dollars 20bn fiscal stimulus was likely this year. Mr Reischauer
reacted unenthusiastically, pointing out that a small fiscal stimulus would
do little for growth and worsen the longer-term problem of reducing the
deficit.
The latter was likely to climb modestly over Mr Clinton's first term, from
Dollars 310bn this fiscal year to about Dollars 357bn in fiscal 1998, he
said. It would then nearly double over the next five years, pushing the
ratio of federal debt to 80 per cent of gross domestic product, the highest
since the aftermath of the second world war.
The main problem was runaway growth of spending on Medicare and Medicaid,
the federal programmes for the elderly and poor, which would account for 7
per cent of GDP by 2003 against 3.7 per cent today.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Clinton faces fight on military gays: Opposition grows in
Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton faces a possible battle with Congress over his
campaign promise to end discrimination against homosexuals in the armed
forces.
Mr Clinton, who already faces the hostility of his top military commanders,
has now run into opposition from many members of Congress, including one of
his staunchest allies, Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia.
White House officials insist that the president remains committed to ending
discrimination against gays in the armed forces solely on the basis of their
sexual preference, while at the same time maintaining military morale and
cohesion.
But fulfilling his campaign promise may now force Mr Clinton into a
gruelling congressional battle and require the expenditure of a good deal of
political capital.
Administration officials hope in a first stage simply to direct Mr Les
Aspin, the secretary of defence, to stop asking new recruits whether they
are homosexual, and to freeze proceedings to remove declared homosexuals
from the armed forces.
Mr Aspin wants to proceed much more slowly on drafting an executive order
formally lifting the ban on homosexuals in the services, and hopes to win
over the military commanders by involving them fully in discussions of how
such a move could be implemented.
But Senator Nunn warned the president that many of the actions needed to end
the ban - such as revisions to the military justice code - lay under the
aegis of Congress, not the executive branch.
Some Republican senators are also planning to introduce a motion supporting
the current policy. Democratic leaders have warned Mr Clinton that he could
count on no more than 30 votes against such a motion in the 100-member
Senate.
Senator Edward Kennedy, who supports Mr Clinton's efforts to end the ban,
acknowledged yesterday that it would take time to implement a new policy.
'It isn't a question of whether there will be gays in the military. There
already are. The question is whether they have to lie about it,' he said.
Congress moved swiftly yesterday to revive the family leave bill vetoed by
President Bush last year, Jurek Martin adds from Washington.
The measure would require companies with more than 50 employees to offer
unpaid leave of up to 12 weeks a year to meet family exigencies, such as
illness and childbirth. The Senate labour committee approved it easily, as
it did another bill to revitalise the National Institutes of Health bill,
also vetoed by Mr Bush.
Revival of the family leave bill was a Clinton campaign promise, similar to
the series of executive orders he issued last Friday lifting many of the
previous administration's restrictions on abortion. The NIH bill is most
noteworthy for provisions facilitating the use of aborted foetal tissue in
medical research.
Republicans will seek to offer alternative legislation on the family leave
issue, involving the use of tax credits.

FT  27 JAN 93 / US may change Angola stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is 'actively reviewing' US policy towards Angola,
and diplomats believe it could soon establish full diplomatic relations with
the Luanda government for the first time since the civil war that followed
independence from Portugal in 1975.
Mr Venacio da Moura, Angola's foreign minister, is expected to meet senior
State Department officials in Washington this week, although the precise
level of the meeting has not yet been arranged.
Under the Bush administration, US patience with its long-time ally, the
Unita resistance movement led by Mr Jonas Savimbi, was already wearing thin.
US officials were irritated by Mr Savimbi's refusal to accept the results of
last year's elections, which they viewed as broadly fair.
Democrats in Congress have never been as convinced as Republicans that Mr
Savimbi was a heroic fighter against communism, and the new administration
is expected to have few qualms about abandoning Unita. Indeed,
administration officials last week stiffly warned Mr Savimbi not to attack
US-owned oilfields in the province of Cabinda.
However, with peace talks between Unita and the MPLA-led government due to
begin in Ethiopia, the Clinton administration is expected to delay any
formal move to recognise the Luanda government.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (6): The power of sausages - Profile:
Ukrainian entrepreneurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE success of the Kyryshko brothers, a trio of bearded giants, each 6ft 6in
tall and weighing in at more than 250lb, is one of the most hopeful signs
that 70 years of Soviet rule has not snuffed out the entrepreneurial
instinct of the Ukrainian people.
From their home base in Bila Tserkva, a provincial city 100km south of Kiev,
the three brothers have built up a food processing empire which achieved a
turnover of Dollars 1m and 1.5bn roubles in 1992.
The biggest obstacles the Kyryshkos face are the endless changes to
Ukrainian law and the breakdown in trade with the former Soviet republics.
The collapse of the inter-republican banking system, and the difficulties of
trying to pay for raw materials with Ukraine's new currency, have persuaded
the Kyryshkos to revert to barter in almost all of their trade outside
Ukraine.
'We produce sausage' explains one of the brothers, Mr Ivan Kyryshko, 'and in
the uncertain economic conditions of our country, sausage is better than
money.'
To obtain glass jars for his vegetable canning factory last year, Mr
Kyryshko was forced to journey to the distant forests of Siberia in order to
buy lumber in exchange for sausage and a cash payment. The lumber was sent
to Kazakhstan, so that steel could be made and shipped to Tiumen so that
caustic soda could be sent to Kiev where Mr Kyryshko's glass jars were
produced.
Building on the power of sausages, the Kyryshkos have created a business
which has a staff of 175 and an additional 150 part-time workers. The
brothers have a contract with farmers in the southern Ukrainian region of
Mykolaiv - chosen because the land there has not been seriously affected by
Chernobyl - to produce vegetables for their canning factories and feed for
their 2,000 cattle and 600 pigs.
Altogether Mr Ihor Kyryshko, another brother, says the business produces as
much meat and vegetables as the entire Bila Tserkva region.
The Kyryshkos also operate a textile factory, have shares in a leading
Ukrainian bank and commodities exchange, and own three Ukrainian newspapers,
a local TV station and a volleyball team.
The Kyryshkos bring a religious zeal to business. 'I only found real
personal fulfilment after perestroika, when I could become a businessman,'
says Mr Ihor Kyryshko.
This attitude seems to be shared by the Kyryshkos' employees. Mr Serhii
Kasianov, manager of the Kyryshko canning factory where 36 workers produce
8m cans a year, explained that he has developed a new work ethic since he
left his job at a state canning factory, not surprisingly as his salary is
now triple the average Ukrainian wage.
Despite the many frustrations that Ukraine's fledgling entrepreneurs face
every day, the Kyryshkos are cautiously optimistic about Ukraine's
reform-minded government. They describe Mr Leonid Kuchma, prime minister and
himself a former factory director, as a man who can get things done.
Businessmen are the people who should be running Ukraine, in the view of Mr
Ihor Kyryshko, who does not rule out a political career for himself. 'If not
us then who?' asks the man whom Ukrainian newspapers have dubbed 'The
Capitalist of Bila Tserkva.'

FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (5): Reforms aim to free farmers -
Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The contrast between Ukraine's prosperous farms and the sparse shelves in
Kiev's state stores provides a dramatic demonstration of the breakdown of
the planned economy. Ukraine's farmers are no longer willing to sell their
produce to the state market now that the threat of retribution from the
centre has disappeared. So the government is trying to bring the market
economy to the Ukrainian countryside.
Agriculture is Ukraine's most efficient and potentially profitable export
industry. Last year, Ukraine's farms produced 39m tonnes of grain, despite a
mild drought. But the Ukrainian government, once responsible for 25 per cent
of grain production in the entire Soviet Union, was forced to import 3m
tonnes of grain last year to make up the short-fall in its 17m-tonne state
order.
Ukraine's new reform-minded government hopes that the agricultural sector
will be the first to reap the fruits of reform and shake up Ukraine's 8,000
collective farms, many of which are inefficient and inert. It has abolished
subsidies for almost all agricultural products, raised the food prices in
state stores by 300-500 per cent and is preparing a package of agricultural
reforms which aim to free farmers to sell their produce at market prices and
dismantle the system whereby the state provided farms with all of their
inputs.
The plan, intended to erode the power of Ukraine's vast agricultural
bureaucracy and bankrupt the most inefficient farms, is political risky. But
Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, minister for the economy and architect of the
government's overall reform programme, is confident that the government can
succeed in implementing its agricultural package.
A decision to continue the old practice of setting a target for government
grain purchases, with the official 'state order' for 1993 pegged at 13
million tonnes, illustrates the reformers' technique for evading criticism
by conservatives. On the face of it, no single measure could be more
threatening to reforms because it is the state order system which has been
used to force farmers to sell to a single monopoly purchaser - the
government.
But, as Mr Pynzenyk explains, officially perpetuating the state order system
is a cosmetic effort to appease political opponents of reform. While the
state order will exist on paper, farms will be able to fulfil their state
order by selling their grain anywhere, including for export. 'The state
order is just a formality, a formal sacrifice we are making to some of our
bureaucracy,' he explains.
The system of central state orders and subsidies may be the main reason for
the relative inefficiency of the agricultural sector. But those farms which
have begun to free themselves from state control have a long way to go.
The 40 Years October (as in 'October Revolution') collective farm, in the
village of Ustynivka about 70km south of Kiev, is one of the more
progressive collectives in the region. The 2,000ha farm, which employs more
than 500 people, began a co-operative venture with ICI nearly a decade ago.
It sold only 70 per cent of this year's crop to the state, and is trying to
sell more of its output independently. Small meat and vegetable processing
factories have been set up on the farm to give it independence from the
monopolistic state food processing industry.
Chemicals bought from the west have boosted grain yields to nearly double
the Ukrainian average. Mr Vasyl Vasylenko, the chief economist, welcomed the
government's price liberalisation. The old system of state-controlled food
prices, coupled with the sudden increase in Russian fuel prices to world
levels, made milk and meat production loss-making activities and forced 40
Years October to cut its dairy cattle herd by 100 head last year.
But Mr Vasylenko will be less pleased by other reforms that the government
is planning to implement. In recent years, as the hand of the state has
withered, farms such as 40 Years October have converted themselves into
closed joint-stock companies dividing the farm into non-tradeable shares
owned by the former collective farm members.
In practice, this has allowed farm directors throughout Ukraine to assume
control of the assets, according to research by Mr Simon Johnson of the
Fuqua School of Business at Duke University and Ms Zanny Minton-Beddoes of
Harvard University.
The government plans to compel the 50 per cent of collective farms which
have become closed stock companies to convert to open joint-stock companies
so that workers can trade their shares and inefficient or corrupt directors
can be replaced.
For more immediate and dramatic results, the government is focusing its
attention on giving plots of land to its citizens, similar to those which
collective farm members have always possessed. More than 13m citizens now
farm these smallholdings. The loosening of state controls in 1992 triggered
a 50 per cent increase in the output of these plots which now provide nearly
a third of total agricultural production.
Earlier this month the government passed a decree giving the cultivators of
private plots full ownership of their land. It is now seeking to increase
the size of the garden plots. 'These garden plots are the main source of
food for the cities' says Mr Pynzenyk.
In Ustynivka, the importance of the garden plots to the general health of
the Ukrainian economy is evident. In the O6 hectare garden plot behind her
immaculate, white-washed house Mrs Paraska Mykhnenko, a retired member of
the 40 Years October collective farm, feeds an entire extended family.
With her pigs, cattle, chickens, turkeys and vegetable garden, Mrs Mykhnenko
supports herself and her husband, her daughter and grand-daughter and the
family of another daughter who lives in Kiev.
'We always gave her almost all of her food,' Mrs Mykhnenko says of the
daughter in Kiev. 'But earlier, she was reluctant to take it. Now, with the
very high prices, she takes everything we give her. It is harder to live in
the city. Here we do not feel the crisis. We grow everything we need.'

FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (4): March to market begins - The Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Converting what was until recently a part of the vast Soviet empire into an
economically viable economy was the most important, and most daunting, task
facing the architects of the new state of Ukraine. But only recently has the
march to the market economy finally begun.
The appointment of Mr Leonid Kuchma as prime minister last November, with
enhanced executive authority to govern by decree, and the selection of known
economic reformers to the cabinet, has been followed by a flurry of
market-orientated reforms.
But the reformers have inherited a bleak and chaotic economy from Mr
Kuchma's conservative predecessor, Mr Vitold Fokin. The collapse of the
Soviet Union left an over-industrialised Ukrainian economy, dependent on
military production, Russian trade and cheap oil. Months of drift and
indecision have meant a reversion to a primitive combination of barter and
corruption.
Not surprisingly, the arrival of the reformers has coincided with a battery
of bleak economic statistics. Rising state spending, now equivalent to more
than 60 per cent of total gross output, and dwindling tax revenues mean that
the government budget deficit has grown to 36 per cent of gross domestic
product, which is financed by credit creation.
It was the persistent release of these credits that provoked the Russian
government to stop recognising Ukrainian-issued rouble credits last summer.
This in turn led to Ukraine's departure from the rouble zone in November and
effectively made Ukraine's government-issued coupons an independent
currency. But the breakdown in monetary relations with Russia has left
Ukrainian enterprises with Rbs426bn in unpaid bills from Russian
enterprises, and no convertible currency in which to conduct essential
trade.
The result is hyperinflation. The monthly inflation rate has risen to 50 per
cent (13,000 per cent a year), fuelled for the moment by the liberalisation
of state food prices in December. In the illegal currency black markets that
cluster around the entrance to Kiev's main department store, Ukraine's
fledgling currency has collapsed in value against both the dollar and the
rouble, although the Ukrainian population remains surprisingly willing to
use the coupon.
Yet while Kiev's citizens wearily go about their business, bemused by fuel
shortages and rising prices, there is no mistaking the new mood of optimism
among Ukraine's western advisers. World Bank officials have been closely
involved in drawing up the government's reform programme while the
International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private finance arm,
which only recently was considering pulling out of Ukraine, is now pressing
ahead with plans for small-scale auctions of state property in the western
Ukrainian city of Lviv.
Even the resident representative of the International Monetary Fund walks
the streets of Kiev with a spring in his step, as IMF teams from Washington
tour government offices in search of meaningful statistics before
negotiations over a stand-by agreement can begin.
The Cabinet of Ministers' draft reform programme sets ambitious targets. By
the end of 1993, Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, minister of the economy, hopes to
reduce inflation to between 3 and 4 per cent a month and cut the budget
deficit to 6 per cent of GDP.
One advantage of delay in starting reform is that Ukrainian officials, and
their western advisers, have been able to learn from the failure of the
Russian government to stabilise inflation and encourage private employment.
All agree that the reformers must take steps to reduce the budget deficit,
stabilise the currency and tax excessive wage increases. But the prevailing
wisdom in Kiev, accepted by both Ukrainian leaders and western officials, is
that budget austerity cannot work without liberalisation and privatisation.
The powerful industrial lobby, which undermined Russia's attempt to
stabilise its inflation rate by demanding inflationary credits from the
central bank, is also responsible for Ukraine's inflation.
The Black Sea shipyard at Mykolaiv, for example, received Rbs3bn in low
interest credit over the past six months in order to pay its 25,000 largely
idle workforce. This practice explains why Ukraine's output has fallen by 20
per cent over the past year but the registered unemployment rate remains
only a little over 1 per cent.
Simply to cut off the credits at once, however economically desirable, would
bankrupt not only industries but whole cities and regions, particularly the
politically unstable eastern regions of Ukraine. The solution, argues Mr
Daniel Kaufman, the World Bank mission chief in Kiev, is to press ahead with
rapid small-scale privatisation, especially of retail stores, trucks and
farmland, and to remove all legal barriers to the registration of new
businesses in order to generate alternative employment.
This is the strategy that Mr Kuchma's government appears to have embraced,
at least on paper. The government has liberalised and partially privatised
agriculture, simplified the system of corporate taxes and plans to adopt
mass small-scale privatisation on the Lviv model. In the meantime, it also
wants to commercialise state enterprises as fast as possible but to keep
potentially profitable large enterprises afloat.
'We will pay money for the conversion of the military-industrial complex,'
says Mr Pynzenyk,'but we will only pay these subsidies when we see a
concrete programme for conversion. We want to privatise some military
establishments as soon as possible, while others will simply have to close
but keep paying their wages for two or three years.'
Yet the real test is whether the government can face up to the many hard
choices which it must make if it is to bring the budget deficit down to a
manageable level. Some have have been taken, for example the introduction of
means-tested welfare payments which reduced the number of recipients from
20m to 2m. But the government watered down its decision to cut food
subsidies, which caused many food prices to triple overnight, by doubling
the minimum wage in the face of popular protest.
Mr Kuchma has not managed to rein in this credit emission as he promised
when he assumed office last November. Central bank officials say that in the
last two months of 1992 there was a net emission of 100bn coupons while
Ukraine's coupon currency has continued to slide on the black market. Until
the government manages to stabilise the inflation rate, it dare not
implement its plan to introduce a new and convertible currency, the Hryvnia.
More fundamentally, the government has made little progress in establishing
an effective monetary authority or banking system with which to control
credit emission and finance trade with other republics, including Russia.
After two months of delay, the government has still not appointed a new
National Bank governor.
'Whatever the government says it will do now, the reform programme cannot
succeed without credible and stable institutions, including an independent
central bank,' laments Mr Oleksandr Sharov, the bank's deputy governor.
The biggest uncertainty which hangs over the reformers' prospects is whether
the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to implement any of its decrees. It
will face opposition from recalcitrant local bureaucrats and powerful
factory directors who have assumed much power over the past year as the hand
of the central state has withered, a problem that Mr Pynzenyk highlights in
the interview opposite.
Still, compared to Russia, the Ukrainian reformers have some advantages, not
least the executive powers that parliament has granted under pressure from
the chairman of parliament, Mr Ivan Pliushch. 'All intelligent people in
Ukraine today realise that the road backwards is a dead end, although the
road forward is steeply uphill,' he says.
'But all we are doing now is consuming what we already have and crawling
further into the pockets of future generations.'
Moreover, Ukraine's relatively small geographic size compared to Russia,
with only a third of its population, means that the government in Kiev can
hope to have more power in the regions than the reformers in Moscow,
especially as Mr Kravchuk's presidential representatives now also take
orders from the prime minister.
'Even the best laws require a mechanism for implementation in the regions,'
says Mr Anatoli Kinakh, presidential representative in the Nykolayev region.
'I see my role as the fulfilment of the decrees of the council of
ministers.'
Whether Ukraine's politicians can manage to achieve the delicate balance
between a politically acceptable level of unemployment and an economically
manageable budget deficit will depend on whether they can find new markets
for their agricultural and industrial production in Europe and the Middle
East and whether western aid materialises.
Ukrainian leaders are keen to develop trade agreements with western Europe.
But to date, Ukraine has received little interest and only miserly
assistance and investment from the west, although its nuclear weapons and
decaying nuclear power plants could represent a significant bargaining chip
and a number of World Bank project loans are said to be in the pipeline.
Mr Kuchma, while disappointed at the lack of western aid, says that the
western attitude is too short-termist.
'If this government fails then the next government will be one which goes
back to the old system,' he says. 'But the road back will be much worse.'

FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (2): Low international profile - Foreign
Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE, the second most populous and powerful former Soviet republic, is a
large question mark on Europe's eastern flank.
Neither the west nor Ukraine has come to terms with the geopolitical
significance of this fledgling country which possesses the largest army in
Europe and shares borders with four eastern European nations.
Part of the explanation for Ukraine's low international profile lies in the
success of Ukraine's foreign policy. Widespread fear of overt conflict
between Ukraine and Russia did not materialise.
Thanks to the diplomatic skills of Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian
president, and the political restraint of his Russian counterpart, Mr Boris
Yeltsin, quarrels over the rusting Black Sea fleet and the lush Crimean
Peninsula did not erupt into a fight.
The second reason for the west's oversight of Ukraine is less commendable.
As diplomats stationed in Kiev are wont to remark sadly, their governments
have not yet worked out where Ukraine fits into the redrawn map of Europe.
One possibility, which senior American officials admit is favoured by some
quarters in the US State Department, is that Ukraine, while nominally
independent, could remain within the Russian sphere of influence.
Ukrainian leaders, however, are adamantly opposed to such an outcome. In the
176 ICBMs stationed on Ukrainian territory they appear to have found a means
of compelling the west to focus its attention specifically on Ukraine.
The missiles, many of which are guarded by soldiers loyal to Kiev, are
scheduled to be dismantled under the provisions of the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (Start 1). But, while Ukrainian leaders remain committed to
becoming non-nuclear in the long run, the parliament is stalling over
ratification of Start 1 in an effort to extract financial assistance and
security guarantees from the west.
Ukraine's nuclear bargaining position has been strengthened considerably by
the Start 2 pact with which Mr George Bush, outgoing US President, and Mr
Yeltsin ushered in the new year. Without Start 1, Start 2 cannot go ahead.
Thus, the international disarmament process, as well as the agreement on
non-nuclear proliferation, depend upon Ukraine.
However, horsetrading with ICBMs could backfire. If Ukraine takes an overly
recalcitrant stance it could earn a reputation in the west as a bellicose
and immature state for years to come. Worse, hardliners in Moscow could
force a Ukraine-Russia confrontation over the nuclear missiles which might
compel Ukraine not only to give up the nuclear weapons without further
hesitation but also to surrender some of its independence in foreign policy.
While the nuclear issue has the greatest ramifications beyond Ukraine's
borders, for Kiev it is only the tip of the iceberg. Ukraine's understaffed
and inexperienced foreign ministry must cope with the question of what role
newly independent Ukraine should play in the world.
In the first months of sovereignty, Ukraine pinned its hopes on close links
with countries such as Canada and the US, home to powerful Ukrainian emigre
communities, European nations such as Germany and France, and Ukraine's
eastern European neighbours.
But, as time wore on, Ukrainian leaders realised the west was in no hurry to
embrace Ukraine. Kiev's focus has since shifted to the Middle East and Asia
 -as exemplified by burgeoning relations with Turkey, Iran, India and China
 -and an effort to renew economic, though not political, ties with former
Soviet republics, including Russia.
Even so, relations with Russia remain a sore point. Mr Leonid Kuchma, the
new Ukrainian prime minister, has - with a sharp rejection of the
nationalist rhetoric of his predecessor - made a point of re-establishing
trading relations with Russia, Ukraine's most important trading partner and
its principal source of oil.
However, his efforts are imperilled by the insistence of some Russian
leaders that working economic ties be accompanied by closer political links.
This latent friction between the two Slav neighbours recently exploded at
the Commonwealth of Independent States summit meeting in Minsk, where
Ukraine clashed with Russia over its refusal to sign a new CIS charter which
sought effectively to transform the organisation into a confederation.
Ukrainian leaders fear that Russia will retaliate by cutting essential fuel
supplies.
If the influence of the hardliners continues to grow in the Kremlin,
disputes over the military and borders could also erupt between Ukraine and
Russia.
Over the past year, the Russian military establishment has watched with
impotent rage as Kiev has taken full command over the 650,000 soldiers who
make up the conventional forces stationed in Ukraine and assumed
administrative control over many of the strategic nuclear weapons stationed
on Ukrainian soil.
A resurgence of nationalists in Moscow could also unravel the delicate
agreement reached this summer by Mr Kravchuk and Mr Yeltsin over the Black
Sea fleet and, by extension, the Crimean Peninsula, which is part of Ukraine
but eyed covetously by many leaders in Russia. A disagreement could also
emerge over Ukraine's eastern territories, which border Russia and are
inhabited by a large Russian minority. Ukraine's generous treatment of its
11m-strong Russian minority has already helped to avert conflict in these
regions, but the tensions provoked in eastern Ukraine by economic reforms
could disrupt the stability Mr Kravchuk has achieved with his sensitive
handling of Ukrainian minorities.
Unlike their confreres in the Baltic republics and central Asia, Russians
have not suffered overt discrimination in independent Ukraine. Many key
government posts, including the ministry of defence, are occupied by ethnic
Russians. Other minorities have also fared well: Jewish organisations say
that the Ukraine government is more helpful than that of any other former
Soviet republic.
Mr Kravchuk has created this relative ethnic harmony by espousing a new
notion of what it means to be Ukrainian.
In contrast with the Ukrainian nationalists' emphasis on ethnic Ukrainians,
Mr Kravchuk has encouraged all inhabitants of Ukraine, regardless of their
ethnic background, to consider themselves fully fledged citizens of the new
state.
His task in Ukraine's second year of independence will be to define the role
of that state in the world at large.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (3): Crooked path to reform - Interview -
Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, deputy prime minister with responsibility for economic
reform, talks to Edward Balls and Chrystia Freeland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Question: What are the goals and methods of your economic reform programme?
Answer: The goal of the reforms is to stabilise the economy and to create
circumstances which will be favourable for its growth. But we are opposed to
the view that we should have stabilisation first and then structural reform.
The lesson we have drawn from Russia's experience is that a pure monetary
approach which looks very good on paper is nearly impossible to implement in
an almost entirely monopolised economy. You cannot expect that with a single
'big bang' liberalisation you can initiate all of the necessary structural
changes in the economy.
For example, one of the most profitable sectors in the economy is metallurgy
but these profits are due entirely to its monopoly position. Until we manage
to de-monopolise this sector we cannot free prices.
Another problem is that there are effectively no owners of state property.
Property is controlled by the directors but no-one controls the directors.
This has led to very serious abuses. We have seen the slow growth of a very
strong alternative economy - an uncontrolled process of free or spontaneous
privatisation. Before we can stabilise the economy we must reassume control
over the state sector.
Q: How will you liberalise the economy and tackle corruption?
A: Wherever you have a closed stock company you should look for corruption.
So we must commercialise enterprises and transform them into open joint
stock companies. We also plan to transform collective farms into open stock
companies.
The other way that these enterprises will change their form is through
bankruptcy. The decision we have taken to liberalise prices and end
subsidies will lead to the almost immediate bankruptcy of many collective
farms. Most collective farms were very positive about our decision on price
liberalisation, especially the good ones because the good farms subsidised
the weak farms.
The people who are opposed to it are the local bureaucrats because our
decisions have restricted their authority considerably. But these days the
private garden plots are the main source of food for the cities. They had a
rise of 50 per cent in their production last year. Not all of this food
reaches the people because the central system of procurement was not
interested in using these garden plots as a source of food.
The only mechanism which can get food from the countryside to the cities is
private small trade and this year we are chiefly interested in small-scale
privatisation to encourage this. Already there are small private concerns
which drive around the countryside buying food which they then sell in the
cities.
Q: So why not just push ahead with mass, small-scale privatisation?
A: The problem is that many monopolist trading organisations have gone over
to a leasing arrangement, thus preventing commercialisation of the trading
system. But we plan a decree which gives the state the right to break the
leasing arrangement if privatisation occurs. Then we will have established
the legal basis for a move forward.
But there is another problem. When some government officials talk about the
interests of the people they are talking about their personal interests. The
private racket takes 10-15 per cent of the profits of the private retail
stores but the state racket hands 50 per cent of state store profits to
local bureaucrats. Opposition to commercialisation comes from people who
have very specific economic interests which they are protecting. So before
we can push ahead with commercialisation we have to take much stricter
control of state enterprises.
Q: Are you going to fire the corrupt regional presidential representatives?
A: We cannot fire presidential representatives, only suggest to the
President that they should be fired. But today the presidential
representatives have a dual subordination (to the president and to the prime
minister). What we want is for the whole presidential administration in the
regions to be dually responsible as well. If we do not manage to secure this
tie between central authorities and regional authorities then our decisions
will hang in the air. Q: What is the timetable for capping credit emissions
and how long will it take before we see effects on the inflation rate?
A: We are now preparing a decree which will limit credit emission to 80 per
cent of our inflation targets. We expect a significant slowing of inflation
only in March when the government will enact its decision to freeze the
average wage and impose high taxes on enterprises which pay higher wages.
Q: Can you control inflation and meet the budget targets without western
aid?
A: I think it is realistic to aim for a budget deficit of 6 per cent of GDP
by the end of this year and we think we need to cover about 1 percentage
point of this with western aid. There is a danger that if we meet this
target then the unemployment rate will rise to 10 per cent, although in our
economy there has always been a category I call the working unemployed.
What we have to do is find a balance between an acceptable level of
unemployment and an acceptable budget deficit. This is a very serious
problem for us which can influence the further course of the reforms and we
cannot avoid taking it into account.
Q: Can you link the decommissioning of nuclear weapons to economic aid?
A: No, I do not think that is realistic. A realistic path is to implement
serious economic reforms in order to attract foreign investment. No-one is
going to invest here when the economic situation is so uncertain. But at the
moment we are concerned about getting a rehabilitation loan from the west.
Q: How long do you expect to keep your job?
A: The government has been granted expanded executive authority for only six
months and in this time we can manage to achieve only the first positive
changes. Once we start implementing the economic reform programme we are
always going to have to be taking corrective actions and we are going to
have to change many details of our programme to make it more politically
acceptable. But you have to assess our programme not on the written plan but
on the actions that are taken.
We have a good saying in Ukraine: a crooked path is faster than a straight
path if it avoids the bureaucrat. The straight path for us could be very
dangerous but this is one of those times when we can take a crooked path. It
will be faster.

FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (1): Facing harsh realities - If it
succeeds, Ukraine's programme of reforms will set an important example for
other former Soviet republics and also elicit a sigh of relief from its
eastern European neighbours
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FOR the rest of the world, Ukraine's emergence as a fully independent state
has come as a not entirely welcome surprise.
Just a few months before Ukraine's referendum on independence on December 1
1991, US President George Bush solemnly lectured Ukrainian leaders on the
need to remain within the Soviet Union.
The day after an overwhelming 90 per cent of Ukrainians voted for
sovereignty, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev appeared on
television to tell them that their ballots did not reflect a popular desire
to leave the Soviet Union.
In defiance of this advice, Ukraine has quietly but firmly prevented the
Commonwealth of Independent States from growing into anything more than a
talking shop. At the same time, the government of President Leonid Kravchuk
put muscle behind its diplomacy by winning the allegiance of former Soviet
soldiers serving on Ukrainian territory, giving Ukraine the largest army in
Europe to the west of Russia.
At home, Mr Kravchuk has developed a national vision sufficiently tough to
secure the loyalty of fiercely patriotic western Ukraine, yet mild enough
not to alienate the Russified east. By initially putting together an
ideologically diverse coalition of nationalists and former communists in the
capital city, he has earned for his country a reputation as one of the most
stable, if least progressive, former Soviet republics.
But independent Ukraine, with a population nearly as large as Britain's and
a territory the size of France, has not met with the warm western embrace
many nationalist politicians anticipated in the first heady days of
sovereignty. The US has been concerned chiefly with trying to bully Ukraine
into giving up its nuclear missiles while western Europe remains largely
indifferent.
Russia, meanwhile, has yet to come to terms with having an independent, and
not necessarily co-operative, Ukraine on its western border. Negotiations
over the division of military and financial assets have been tense, while
Moscow became so exasperated with the Ukrainian government's refusal, under
the leadership of Mr Vitold Fokin, former prime minister, to stop creating
rouble bank credits that it effectively forced Ukraine to leave the rouble
zone last November.
Only Ukraine's eastern European neighbours, happy at last to have a strong
state separating them from Russia, have greeted Ukraine with enthusiasm. For
the most part, Ukrainian leaders have been forced to draw the conclusion
expressed in a recent interview by Mr Leonid Kuchma, the new and
economically progressive prime minister. 'We know that independent Ukraine
is a bone in the throats of many countries,' he said. 'Many nations would
prefer that Ukraine did not exist.'
A year ago, when Ukraine was preoccupied with establishing its place in the
world, no one in Kiev would have dared to speak so bluntly. Ukraine today is
at the same time more self-confident and more coldly realistic. As the
country's economic problems have mounted, Mr Kravchuk and his romantic
nationalism have faded into the background, and a team of economists and
industrialists, led by the hard-headed Mr Kuchma, has taken centre stage.
The shift in power has been dictated by a shift in political focus. The
concern with the attributes of independence - flags and anthems - and its
guarantor - the army - has given way to dismay at the collapse in the value
of Ukraine's fledgling currency against both the dollar and the rouble. The
World Bank estimates that Ukraine's economy contracted by 20 per cent last
year while inflation was 2,500 per cent.
After less than three months in office, Mr Kuchma - previously director of
the world's largest rocket factory - has concluded that the only solution is
a radical move to the market. His government tripled state food prices in
December and abolished most agricultural subsidies. It is now pressing ahead
with plans to commercialise state enterprises and privatise retail and
agriculture sectors.
'I cannot imagine doing anything other than maintaining the reform programme
and I will continue with the steps I have taken,' Mr Kuchma says. 'There is
no other path. If someone could show me another path and say it were
possible not to raise prices I would take it, but I do not think it exists.'
Mr Kuchma's government has the authority to rule the economy by decree until
May and has already used its expanded power to produce a stream of
market-oriented decrees.
Yet, few of the really tough decisions have been taken. The real test will
be whether the government can act to stop the extension of credits to
struggling state enterprises; the first steps in this direction have already
provoked fierce opposition from factory directors, and from workers who will
lose their jobs, particularly in the eastern regions which are heavily
dependent on coal-mining, and least loyal to the new Ukraine. In the short
term, Mr Kuchma has the political strength to push through unpopular
measures. Parliament, under pressure from its reformist chairman, Mr Ivan
Pliushch, agreed in November to restrict its own right to pass economic
legislation. In theory, parliament can reject any decree within 10 days
after the cabinet has issued it. However, given the legislature's sluggish
reaction time and Mr Pliushch's skill at riding rough-shod over dissenting
voices, Mr Kuchma has considerable authority in in Kiev.
Whether the reforms will succeed depends, in large part, on whether they are
implemented locally. The network of presidential representatives, created
last year by Mr Kravchuk to extend his authority to the regions, is now
responsible to the prime minister as well. But the reforms risk being
blocked by the state bureaucrats and factory and farm directors who are
profiting from the chaos in the Ukrainian economy.
The government wants to use economic reform to reduce the power of the
bureaucrats and Mr Kuchma has launched a high-profile anti-corruption drive.
But these vested interests will put up a formidable fight against market
measures.
While Ukrainian reformers face powerful enemies at home in their efforts to
find solutions to the economic problems which are at the top of this year's
political agenda, the external issues which preoccupied Ukraine last year
will continue to influence the government's course.
Ukraine's most important foreign relationship remains that with Russia. Last
year, Ukraine's chief worry was that Russia would stand in the way of its
independence drive and pursue unresolved territorial claims over the Crimean
peninsula; this year Ukrainians are concerned that Russia's insistence on
world prices for its oil will, in Mr Kuchma's words, result in 'a complete
paralysis of Ukrainian industry.' Ukraine, like eastern Europe two years
ago, will be required to pay a stiff price for its independence.
One solution to Ukraine's balance of trade crisis with Russia might be a
western financial aid package to support Ukrainian reforms and help wean the
Ukrainian economy away from its dependency on Russian oil. Yet, western aid
could hinge on the outcome of the escalating dispute between Ukraine and the
US over the 176 Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles located on Ukrainian
territory. The Ukrainian parliament is hesitating over ratification of the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1), which provides for the
dismantling of all the Ukrainian missiles, in an attempt to extract security
guarantees and economic aid.
America has been slow to listen to Ukraine's demands, expecting Kiev to cave
in to strong diplomatic pressure. But Ukrainian leaders have yet again taken
the State Department by surprise. Mr Kuchma's reaction has been to accuse
America of 'treating Ukraine like a puppet' and to point out that, having
given Ukraine little aid, America has little leverage.
Over the next few months, America and the other G7 countries may find
themselves compelled to take Ukraine more seriously, and not just because of
the nuclear missiles. If it succeeds, Ukraine's reform programme will set an
important example for other former Soviet republics and elicit a sigh of
relief from its eastern European neighbours. If it fails, the existence of
an economically collapsing Ukraine alongside a troubled Russia could imperil
the security of the entire region.

FT  27 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie nears its peak after rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England caught the London stock market wrong-footed yesterday
morning with the unexpected announcement of a one percentage-point cut in
domestic interest rates. The City of London had expected the rate reduction
to be held back until nearer to Budget day.
The market scored its biggest daily gain since mid-September, the FT-SE 100
Index closing within one per cent of its all-time high, after equity
strategists saw the base rate move as a clear signal that 'the government is
putting economic growth first, and inflation risk second', to quote one
leading analyst.
After dawdling at the opening, the UK markets sprang to life when the Bank
announced that interest rates were being lowered to 6 per cent. Trading
volume increased substantially in both stock index futures and the
underlying equity market.
Share prices boiled over after the initial gain of 63 Footsie points but
buyers returned at the close in spite of hints that a large rights issue was
back on the corporate agenda in the wake of the Bank's action.
At its final reading of 2,835.7, the FT-SE Index was 63.8 up on the day and
only 26 points below the peak of 2,861.5 reached on January 4 this year. The
largest gains came in those sectors directly benefiting from lower interest
rates, notably building materials, construction and contracting, food
retailers, banks and other financial institutions.
Although the focus was on the FT-SE 100 stocks, the second liners were also
strong. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 1.6 per cent to 2,951.6.
The success of the UK authorities in catching the market unawares was
reflected in trading volume data. On Monday, Seaq volume fell to 490.3m
shares, which was worth only Pounds 984m in retail terms, at the lower range
of recent daily averages. But in the wake of the interest rate cut, Seaq
turnover jumped to 861.8m shares yesterday.
Market analysts were in no doubt that the move to 6 per cent base rates was
a green light for the stock market. Base rates have now been reduced by 400
basis points since sterling's departure from the ERM network in
mid-September and the benefits are expected to show up dramatically in the
March round of final corporate results.
Sterling stood up well to the move and the government bond market advanced
smartly as investment houses hurriedly reshaped their stances ahead of
today's auction of Pounds 2.5bn of UK government securities.
However, Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull, said that yesterday's move was
'the end of the economically justifiable rate cuts - any further reductions
could seriously endanger sterling'.
Many strategists, perhaps showing wisdom after the event, said the
authorities either had to make their move on interest rates before the bond
auction, or wait until well afterwards; some suggested that the rate cut,
regarded as a reaction to last week's poor data on UK unemployment, might
have been delayed until the new governor of the Bank of England could set
his seal on the decision.
Equity professionals are convinced that share earnings will now achieve a
recovery of 15 to 20 per cent this year, but asked themselves what further
move to stimulate the economy the government can now produce on Budget day
in March.

FT  27 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hopes for Reuters service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS AND electronic dealing agency Reuters Holdings advanced sharply ahead
of a presentation by the company today of a new information service. The
optimism countered the effect that a fall in interest rates will have on the
group's cash mountain of about Pounds 650m.
The company has invited electronics and media analysts to a preview of
Equity Focus, a system which is designed to attack the Pounds 60m a year
market dominated by the Topic information service controlled by the London
Stock Exchange.
Following recent slides, Reuters shares bounced 35 to 1348p. The price was
also supported by news that Reuters has signed a long-term agreement under
which two companies will give Reuters exclusive data on certain non-US
government debt securities.
Mr Brian Newman, of agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite, who is an
established Reuters enthusiast, added that the shares had been oversold
following recent bear raids and that the shares were due for a strong rally
ahead of preliminary figures on February 9.
Glaxo slides
A sharp shift from recession-defensive stocks hit the pharmaceutical sector
in general and Glaxo in particular. The group, consistently at or near the
top of the market's league of most highly valued companies, was also
affected by news of a senior management appointment.
The announcement that Mr Arthur Pappas has been made responsible for
strategy for over-the-counter drug business in the US revived concern that
the company might be considering a bid in that area.
There was also a continuation of heavy US selling. Lehman Brothers, the US
investment bank, was a big seller on both sides of the Atlantic. The shares
retreated 13 to 682p, their lowest level since July, with 5.7m traded.
Asda nerves
In a buoyant food retail sector, talk of a rights issue by Asda held back
the shares, which closed a mere halfpenny ahead at 66p. There were
suggestions of an imminent three-for-one issue at 50p, a move which would
raise about Pounds 350m for the indebted supermarket group.
While many analysts were receptive to the notion, most questioned the
timing, saying much of Asda's debt was fixed until the end of the year. With
an improving trading position, the need for such a large amount of cash was
also brought into question, although Asda's refurbishment and new store
programme could be accelerated by an injection.
Dealers further reported continued US selling on the back of a negative US
note last week. Sellers were said to be switching into Kwik Save, up 13 at
820p. Elsewhere, Argyll Group forged ahead 14 1/2 to 398p, J. Sainsbury 17
to 572p and Shoprite 43 to 773p.
Euro Disney strong
Expected poor first-quarter results from Euro Disney had the unexpected
effect of sending the shares sharply forward. They rose on a rumour that one
big US house had turned positive, leaping 35 before receding to close 28 up
at 808p.
Merrill Lynch was reported to have raised its intermediate-term rating on
the stock to above average from neutral, and increased its long-term rating
to buy from above average. The house was unable to comment on the report.
However, neither the rumour nor the results satisfied London analysts, who
remained largely negative. 'I have heard nothing today to alter my
pessimistic view,' said Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas, who retained his forecast
of a full-year loss of FFr1.024bn (Pounds 120m).
News that Kuwait is prepared to join Saudi Arabia and Iran in cutting output
in order to drive oil prices higher, better than expected fourth-quarter
earnings from Exxon, the US oil giant, and a fresh upsurge by Wall Street
drove the oil sector sharply higher again.
UK oil specialists, however, tended to adopt a cautious attitude to the
sector, saying that the rise in oil prices and oil shares in recent days had
already discounted any good news expected from the February 13 Opec meeting.
'It is precautionary buying, an insurance policy against oil prices moving
above Dollars 20,' said one oil analyst.
BP was the star performer, climbing 10 more to 241 1/2 p in the wake of some
sustained buying interest from the US. Turnover in BP reached a hefty 19m
shares. Shell advanced 17 to 547p on 7.5m traded. A buyer of 1m Enterprise
Oil shares was responsible for driving the stock up 13 to 434p.
The market was caught on the hop by the Pounds 80m rights issue from Wessex
Water, the first cash call from any of the privatised utilities, to help
finance the acquisition of Waste Management from NFC.
Wessex shares dropped to 554p immediately following the news but later
rallied to close 9 off at 568p. NFC, an exceptionally strong market since
the middle of last week, appreciated 3 to 274p.
Other water issues, poor performers recently as hints of possible cash calls
to fund acquisitions circulated in the market, staged a good revival. North
West Water, known to be keen on expanding in the waste disposal area,
rallied 12 to 469p on heavy turnover of 4.1m, while Severn Trent, which
bought the Biffa waste disposal business from BET a couple of years ago,
added 11 at 459p with 3.3m shares traded. Thames put on 6 at 477p on 2.4m
and Anglian 5 at 475p.
Electricity stocks, on the other hand, underperformed the market, with
dealers highlighting a shift in sentiment away from the more defensive areas
of the market to the cyclical sectors.
Bank shares were in the forefront of the market's surge, led by Barclays, up
20 at 435p on 13m traded, Lloyds, 22 ahead at 535p, and National
Westminster, which raced up 14 to 457p. Discount houses, beneficiaries of
falling interest rates, showed Cater Allen 15 better at 428p, while a strong
merchant banks area was highlighted by Kleinwort Benson, 14 to the good at
332p.
Royal Insurance was one of only nine FT-SE 100 stocks to lose ground over
the session. Royal slipped 3 to 285p in heavy two-way trade of 6.2m amid
renewed speculation that the composite insurer could be about to launch a
substantial rights issue in order to rebuild its capital base.
Smiths Industries, a supplier to Boeing, fell 10 to 359p after the aircraft
maker announced production cuts.
Turnover in British Aerospace reached 5.2m, although the strong buying of
the past week appeared to have run out of steam and the stock closed only a
penny firmer at 228p. Recently announced increases in steel prices helped
ASW Holdings add 8 at 126p.
Several stocks were assisted by yield buying. These included IMI, up 8 at
268p, VSEL, 9 better at 525p, GKN, also up 9 at 466p, and T &amp; N, which moved
7 ahead to 178p.
Shares in Bromsgrove gained 5 to 87p after a buy recommendation from James
Capel Unit Trusts.
In transports, Associated British Ports jumped 14 to 378p on the
announcement of an Pounds 18m expansion plan.
A two-way pull on MFI pinned back the shares to a rise of just 2 at 139p.
While a number of brokers remain positive on the stock - yesterday Carr
Kitcat &amp; Aitken issued a full-bodied note advising investors to 'buy on
weakness' - more spurious stories were also doing the rounds, suggesting
January sales had been weak.
The stronger dollar, together with presentations to Scottish institutions,
helped Grand Metropolitan surge 22 to 457p.
Carlton Communications was held back as Hoare Govett highlighted a trade
press article on the threat to the company by pay-as-you-watch transmission
operations. The shares eased a penny to 790p.
Conglomerate Hanson saw unusually heavy turnover of 16m, the shares closing
6 1/2 better at 243 1/2 p as chairman Lord Hanson gave a cautiously
optimistic agm statement.

FT  27 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DERIVATIVES sector had one of its best days in the last few months with
turnover rising sharply, after the cut in interest rates took dealers by
surprise, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, traders had expected a run-of-the-mill session when
the March contract on the FT-SE started trading at 2,785. Having retreated
to 2,782 in early selling, March surged forward after the announcement of
the reduction in rates. Within minutes of the news the contract was trading
at 2,830, although a dealer pointed out that there was a lack of liquidity
initially.
However, turnover began to be generated when leading US houses moved in as
big buyers, and most of the selling was done by independent traders.
March ended at 2,860, up 88 from Monday's close and around 29 points above
its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 9. Turnover at 21,024 lots
was 160 per cent above January's average total.
Heavy trading was also seen on the traded options side, where the average
daily volume for the last month jumped by 130 per cent to 53,586 contracts
from Tuesday's total of 21,384 lots.
The FT-SE 100 option had 20,820 lots traded. The rest of the sector was also
busy. Asda was the most active stock option, with 3,638 contracts transacted
as talk of a rights issue did the rounds. It was followed by Trafalgar House
at 2,292, and GEC at 2,035.

FT  27 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Cut in UK base rates lifts
Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cut in UK base rates lifted many Continental markets, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT saw further bad news in the car sector depress prices but overall
the market was firmer and the DAX index closed 6.92 higher at 1,576.16.
Turnover rose to DM5.4bn from DM4.3bn.
Porsche, down DM24 at DM440, announced a loss of nearly DM66m for 1991-92
and said that it would make substantial job cuts.
James Capel in London comments that the results 'underline the parlous state
of the luxury sports car segment and, in particular, the loss of
competitiveness on the part of the company due to a weak model range, poor
productivity and the adverse effect of the strength of the DM'. Recommending
a sell, the brokers welcome the appointment of Mr Helmut Sihler as head of
the supervisory board but believe that it is too early to buy for recovery.
BMW added to Monday's declines with a fall of DM4.50 to DM497, but Daimler,
helped by good sales figures for Mercedes models, gained a modest 30 pfg to
DM573. Volkswagen slipped 70 pfg to DM272.30.
Elsewhere Siemens put on DM8.50 to DM607.70 after announcing new orders.
PARIS featured Euro Disney which rose FFr2.70 or 4.3 per cent to FFr67.20 on
rumours that a US broker had upgraded the stock. The shares had earlier
fallen to a day's low of FFr63.20 after the company reported a loss of
FFr492m in the first quarter of fiscal 1992-93.
The CAC-40 index closed 12.60 higher at 1,792.55 in turnover of some
FFr2.4bn.
Elf came in with a 36 per cent fall in 1992 net profit which was
better-than-expected and the shares closed FFr6.40 higher at FFr330.70,
while Total improved FFr5.50 to FFr223.50.
Matra-Hachette eased FFr7.40 or 7.4 per cent to FFr92.00 with some 3.2m
shares traded on arbitrage related activity.
MILAN finished a mixed session firmer after inflation indicators for January
lifted hopes of a discount rate cut. The Comit index added 1.0 to 473.09.
Firmer banks and insurers took their lead from a strong performance by
Generali which rose L60 to fix at L32,600 before spurting to L33,550 after
hours amid domestic demand from regional retail banks.
Fiat, widely expected to post an operating loss for 1992 later this week,
still managed a L9 advance to L4,295 at the fix before putting on a further
L7 in late business.
Rinascente rose L270 to fix at L7,735 before moving on up to L7,750 amid
renewed speculation that it may be sold by parent group Fiat. Montedison
dipped a further L35 to L1,181. It faces a demand for compensation by state
energy group ENI over a former joint venture.
ZURICH was mixed in fairly active trade. The SMI index eased 1.1 to 2,084.3.
Insurers had a firm session on a view that the sector had recently been
neglected. Participation certificates in Winterthur Insurance, SFr18 higher
at SFr596, topped the active list.
Nestle lost SFr15 to SFr1,065 amid market rumours that it might be planning
a capital increase soon. After the stock market closed, the company reported
a rise in consolidated sales for 1992 that was in line with, or slightly
below, most analysts' expectations.
SMH rose SFr40 to SFr1,525 when new buying set in after recent declines.
AMSTERDAM eased, while Daf's scheduled announcement of its restructuring
package was postponed. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.3 to 97.7 with many
issues affected by the weaker dollar.
Royal Dutch went against the trend with a Fl 1.20 rise to Fl 144.80.
Hoogovens, flat at Fl 25.40, announced after the close that it would be
increasing steel prices by up to 15 per cent from April.
MADRID improved in late trading encouraged by a firmer bond market and the
general index rose 3.13 to 233.23 in turnover of Pta17bn. Endesa rose Pta100
to Pta4,085.
STOCKHOLM came back from early lower levels but the momentum faded in late
trade. The Affaersvarlden rose 3.8 to 896.2 in heavy trading.
The forestry sector turned lower after Stora announced a preliminary 1992
loss of SKr1.4bn. Stora's B-shares closed SKr7 down at SKr263.

FT  27 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Boost from IBM news offset by
late selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK markets advanced strongly in early trading yesterday, buoyed by
relief that IBM's decision on a dividend cut has been made, and also by
hopes of lower interest rates in Europe, but a late sell-off trimmed the
gains to a minimum by the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally just 6.75 up at 3,298.95, well
below the day's peak of 3,320.03. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar
fashion but ended 0.06 off on the day at 439.95. The American SE composite
finished 2.08 higher at 411.60, while the Nasdaq composite settled only 0.21
ahead at 707.16, although another record close. Trading volume on the New
York SE was a heavy 314m shares.
Following Monday's sharp advance, analysts were not surprised by the markets
finally pausing to consolidate gains yesterday. Prices initially
strengthened from the opening, helped by a number of positive factors.
Overnight news of a cut in UK interest rates was greeted warmly. Economists
in the US said they hoped the cut might persuade the Bundesbank to lower
German interest rates, which would be good for European economies as a whole
and boost demand for US exports to the region.
Domestically, news of a 5 per cent rise in December existing home sales also
lifted sentiment, as did IBM's decision to cut its quarterly dividend by
more than half. The market, which has been waiting for IBM to move on its
dividend for weeks, was also pleased by the announcement that the group had
begun a search for a new chief executive to replace the much-criticised Mr
John Akers.
IBM added more than Dollars 3 in early trading, before falling back to end
only Dollars  1/8 up on balance at Dollars 49 in volume of 6.3m shares.
Other leading stocks were boosted by news of strong earnings. Walt Disney
rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 46 3/8 in busy trading after the entertainment
group announced late on Monday fiscal first-quarter profits of Dollars 260m,
or 48 cents a share, well up from the Dollars 208m, or 39 cents a share,
earned at the same stage a year ago.
BankAmerica was also higher following quarterly results and its shares
advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 53 1/2 after the banking group announced
that fourth-quarter net income totalled Dollars 473m, about the same as in
the previous quarter. Analysts said that while the earnings were in line
with expectations, the market was pleasantly surprised by the small increase
in intangible assets during the quarter.
American Express bucked the market-wide trend, falling Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 24 in volume of 6.4m shares as investors registered their
disappointment at the news that Mr James Robinson was staying on as chairman
of the troubled travel and financial services group. The shares had risen in
recent weeks on hopes that Mr Robinson would soon be replaced.
Merck weakened Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 39 1/2 in heavy trading after the
large drugs group announced slightly disappointing fourth-quarter results.
Canada
TORONTO share prices ended higher, following the trend set in most major
world markets yesterday.
The TSE 300 index gained 17.2 at 3,312.8 and advances outscored declines by
348 to 293 after volume of 43.5m shares valued at CDollars 523.3m.
The golds and industrial products sectors recorded the biggest gains, of
2.34 per cent and 1.82 per cent respectively.
Northern Telecom reported higher fourth-quarter and annual earnings. The
stock jumped CDollars 3 7/8 to CDollars 57 7/8 .

FT  27 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok is encouraged by economic
outlook - Victor Mallet assesses the market's recent rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the start of the year brokers in Bangkok have been asking themselves
when, not if, the Stock Exchange of Thailand index would rise above the
1,000 mark.
The economy is buoyant and still growing at around 7 to 8 per cent a year;
the government is stable; and last year's gloom among local investors has
dissipated with each day of the police struggle to prepare a case against Mr
Song Watcharasriroj, better known as Sia Song, who has been accused of share
manipulation.
In the event the 1,000 level was breached on Monday, albeit briefly; the
first time it has risen above this barrier since August 1990, the month Iraq
invaded Kuwait. The SET index topped 1,001 that afternoon, before receding
slightly to close 18.74 ahead on the day at 998.44 - nearly 50 per cent
above its low in May last year when the Thai army shot pro-democracy
demonstrators on the streets of the capital. Profit-taking yesterday saw the
index fall 10.47 to 987.97.
Most brokers expect the market to continue rising in the weeks ahead and do
not consider the recent rally as just a short-lived bout of euphoria
prompted by last weekend's festivities for the Chinese new year.
With interest rates falling, investors are being encouraged to put their
money in stocks rather than on deposit at the banks.
Industrial companies with capacity to spare are deferring further expansion,
thus restraining demand for credit (and rights issues), and the monetary
authorities are also urging commercial banks to reduce lending rates and cut
the wide spreads between lending and deposit rates.
Ironically, bank shares, which represent 26 per cent of the index, have been
in the vanguard of the market's recent surge on the strength of profits made
out of those same wide spreads.
To say the profits of Thai banks are healthy would be an understatement.
Bangkok Bank, the country's largest, lifted net profits in 1992 by 45 per
cent from the previous year's level to Bt10.54bn (Dollars 415m). Thai
Military Bank's profits were up 79 per cent, Thai Farmers Bank's 53 per cent
and Krung Thai Bank's an impressive 139 per cent.
Although bank margins could narrow in the current year, the Thai Bankers
Association is a powerful lobby group which will do its best to resist the
pressure from the central bank.
Furthermore, the costs of some banks will fall when they can access funds
via the new Bangkok International Banking Facility with its various tax
advantages.
A foreign broker in Bangkok commented: 'I think the margin environment for
them this year is going to continue to be very good.'
The strong position of the banks has led to a revaluation of the whole
sector. Typical price/earnings ratios have risen from about eight times to
current levels of 11 or 12 and are expected to further increase to 14 or 15.
Basic consumer stocks, such as Serm Suk and Haad Thip, which bottle
Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola respectively, are also doing well as the wealth
generated by economic expansion spreads slowly to the provinces. Franchise
holders of luxury brand names are also being tipped as good buys.
Among other contributors to the recent rise of the market are the leveraged
property groups, which are benefiting from lower interest rates, and finance
and securities companies, which have quickly rec-overed from the gloom over
the Sia Song scandal and restrictions imposed on their loans to clients for
the purchase of shares.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: BMW expects fall in car
deliveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BMW, the German luxury car maker, expects deliveries to distributors to fall
this year for the first time since 1974.
The setback follows progress in 1992 when BMW recorded a 4.7 per cent
increase in turnover and a 7.6 per cent rise in deliveries to 598,000 units.
However, turnover growth was hit by currency devaluations and the increased
share in sales of the cheaper 3-series. Profits, which were not disclosed,
were satisfactory, the group said in a letter to shareholders yesterday.
Publication of the letter knocked DM15.30 off BMW shares in Frankfurt, which
closed at the day's low of DM501.50. The DAX index of 30 leading shares fell
18.40 points to 1,569.24.
The group said it expected world demand for new cars in 1993 to stagnate at
1992's level of 33.5m. Recovery in the US was likely to be offset by weak
demand in Japan and Europe.
The group said economic improvements, expected in the second half, would not
prevent a fall in BMW deliveries for the year. This would be only the second
interruption to more than 30 years of progress.
Productivity improvement, which last year saw 1,800 job losses in Germany,
would be continued. Last year, new BMW registrations in Europe climbed 7 per
cent to 440,000 units. Sales in the US rose 23 per cent to 65,700, reversing
a long-term decline.

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Sears Roebuck
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sears Roebuck's decision to to pull out of catalogue retailing at least
proves that the company is no longer sentimental about the business which
made it great. It seems Mr Arthur Martinez, brought in last year to give the
backward-looking giant a fresh perspective, can carry the board on tough
issues. Last autumn's announcement that the financial services operations
were to go has now been followed by closure of the worst stores and some
sensible cost-cutting.
But these defensive measures do not add up to a strategy. The core business
has been squeezed between discount retailers and specialist stores. Previous
initiatives such as everyday low pricing of goods have failed to halt the
decline - as UK imitators such as Kingfisher might care to note. Focusing on
a smaller area may concentrate management minds, but there is as yet little
evidence of the required retailing spark. Sears apparently wishes to expand
its women's wear operations, which have improved substantially in recent
years. Yet that will bring it into even closer competition with its rival JC
Penney in a fiercely fought market.
One priority must be to get rid of the company's staid image. That will
require top management to modernise the stores and, more importantly, the
culture of Sears' army of sales staff. Such strategic shifts are tough.
Changing the public image of a retailer is the hardest task of all.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bankers Trust climbs 24%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS TRUST, the big New York banking group, yesterday unveiled a healthy
24 per cent rise in fourth-quarter 1992 net earnings, to Dollars 170m, or
Dollars 1.97 per share.
The profits improvement occurred despite halved fourth-quarter trading
revenues of Dollars 101m. It was helped along by lower bad debt provisions
and higher net interest and fee income.
The bank's net interest revenues before provisions in the fourth quarter was
Dollars 396m, sharply higher than the Dollars 168m recorded in the last
quarter of 1991.
Fiduciary and funds management generated Dollars 158m of revenues, up by 19
per cent year-on-year. Fees and commissions were up 9 per cent at Dollars
144m.
Fourth-quarter bad debt provisions declined by 25 per cent to Dollars 50m.
Provisions for the whole of 1992 were 13 per cent lower at Dollars 225m.
Total non-performing assets were down by 4 per cent to Dollars 2.46bn in the
final quarter of 1992.
For the full year, Bankers Trust recorded Dollars 761m, or Dollars 8.82 per
share, of net profits, up by 14 per cent on the Dollars 667m, or Dollars
7.75, earned in 1991.
Mr Charles Sanford, chairman of Bankers Trust, said the results demonstrated
the inherent strength within the bank's portfolio of businesses, including
risk management, underwriting, advisory, asset management, lending and
operational services.
He said favourable trends in asset quality positioned the bank for a
promising 1993.
The bank's capital was also strengthened during 1992, with total equity of
Dollars 3.8bn at year-end, some Dollars 397m higher than at the end of 1991.
The important tier one capital-to-assets ratio used by bank regulators was
7.65 per cent at year-end.
On Wall Street, the bank's share price was Dollars 1 1/8 lower at Dollars 66
5/8 at the close.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Siemens keen to acquire GEC's 60% stake in
GPT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, is eager to buy from
GEC the 60 per cent stake in GPT it does not already own, but so far the UK
company has shown no willingness to sell.
Neither Siemens nor GEC would comment yesterday on reports that the German
company had offered Lord Weinstock up to Pounds 800m for GEC's share in the
telecommunications equipment maker.
GPT, which last year made Pounds 127m in pre-tax profits, was formed through
the merging of the telecommunications manufacturing interests of GEC and
Plessey. It has been jointly owned by GEC and Siemens since 1989 when the
two companies successfully made a bid for Plessey.
Siemens' UK operations were profitable last year but if the contribution
from GPT is excluded, the UK subsidiary was in loss.
Mr Jurgen Gehrels, chief executive of Siemens UK, last week said that the
price paid for Plessey had been too high because the company had been bought
when the market was buoyant.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Allders may return to market in autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLDERS, the department store and duty free company which was taken private
after a Pounds 224m buy-out from Hanson in 1989, is considering returning to
the stock market, possibly in the autumn.
No timetable for the possible flotation has been fixed, and the company is
now recruiting a stockbroker and other advisers. Schroders, which arranged a
1991 financial restructuring for the company, is likely to be retained as
financial adviser.
The restructuring, prompted by poor trading conditions and a looming debt
repayment peak, included a Pounds 10m injection of fresh equity,
underwritten by Prudential Venture Managers, 3i and CIN Venture Managers.
Following the 1989 buy-out, Allders said it wanted to return to the stock
market within four years to use the proceeds of the flotation to pay off
borrowings.
Allders operates 11 UK department stores and claims to be the world's second
largest duty free retailer, after Duty Free Shoppers of the US.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Shearson loss behind sharp fall
at American Express
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment banking and brokerage
subsidiary, helped cause a sharp slump in fourth-quarter 1992 net income at
American Express, the travel and financial services group.
American Express suffered a 65.4 per cent drop in net profits in the last
quarter of 1992, to Dollars 82m. For the whole of 1992, American Express
earnings before accounting charges were 44.7 per cent lower at Dollars 436m.
Shearson's fourth-quarter loss, a result of legal provisions and property
writedowns, was Dollars 166m. This compared to a Dollars 130m net profit in
the same quarter of 1991.
For the whole of 1992, Shearson lost Dollars 116m, compared to a 1991 net
profit of Dollars 207m.
Revenues at American Express were unchanged in the fourth quarter at Dollars
6.7bn and 4 per cent higher at Dollars 26.96bn for the whole year.
The group's core travel related services (TRS) division saw its 1992 net
profit slump to Dollars 243m from Dollars 396m in 1991. The results included
a third-quarter Dollars 342m after-tax restructuring charge. Fourth-quarter
TRS net income recovered to Dollars 181m from Dollars 81m a year earlier.
American Express Bank saw its 1992 net profit fall to Dollars 26m from
Dollars 60m in 1991.
The IDS Financial Services division reported 1992 net income of Dollars
297m, up by 20 per cent year-on-year. First Data Corporation, a financial
services processing business in which American Express reduced its
shareholding last year from 100 to 54 per cent, had 20 per cent better net
earnings of Dollars 141m in 1992.
Mr James Robinson, who gave up his job as chief executive to Mr Harvey Golub
yesterday while remaining as chairman of the group, said Shearson Lehman had
strengthened its balance sheet during 1992.
He said the emphasis would be on improving profitability at Shearson in 1993
as he takes over as chairman and chief executive of the American Express
subsidiary.
Mr Robinson said significant items in 1992 included a fourth-quarter legal
provision and property write-down of Dollars 166m at Shearson; Dollars 300m
of added reserves at The Balcor Company, a property subsidiary; Dollars 150m
of charges related to Shearson's holding in Computervision, a company which
had received a bridge loan from the investment bank; and a Dollars 425m gain
on First Data Corporation, which had shares floated last year in a public
offer.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Golub takes over from Robinson at American Express
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HARVEY Golub, president of American Express, the large US travel and
financial services group, was yesterday named by the board of directors as
the new chief executive, replacing Mr James Robinson, the group's embattled
chairman and chief executive.
The 53-year-old Mr Golub, a low-key manager who is respected mainly for his
technical skills, was Mr Robinson's hand-picked heir.
Mr Robinson, however, managed unexpectedly to retain his position as
chairman of American Express and - in a surprising development - was also
named chairman and chief executive of Shearson Lehman Brothers, the
investment banking and brokerage subsidiary. In doing so the 57-year-old Mr
Robinson replaced Mr Howard Clark, Jr, the previous chairman and chief
executive he had installed at Shearson at the height of its losses two years
ago and who was instead named vice chairman of Shearson.
Shortly after the management upheaval was announced last night, American
Express also disclosed that its fourth-quarter 1992 net profits before
accounting charges had crashed by 65.4 per cent to Dollars 82m,
incorporating a net loss of Dollars 166m from Shearson in the quarter.
American Express also unveiled that its full-year 1992 net profit before
accounting charges had slumped to Dollars 436m from Dollars 789m in 1991,
with Shearson suffering a Dollars 116m loss for the whole of 1992.
Mr Golub, who said yesterday that 'Jim and I will continue to work together
as a team', has been Mr Robinson's chosen candidate since the American
Express board last autumn asked him to form a search committee to seek his
own successor.
Mr Robinson last month denied that he was being forced out of the chief
executive's job because of losses at the company's credit card business,
reduced profits and pressure on the stock price.
Analysts said they were struck yesterday by Mr Robinson's ability to survive
at American Express, both as chairman and in his new job running a
subsidiary that previously reported to him.
Mr Robinson said yesterday his prime mission was to work at Shearson Lehman;
he did not rule out the sale of Shearson stock in a public offer.

FT  26 JAN 93 / MPs seek reprieve of 20 pits: All-party committee likely to
recommend coal subsidy of Pounds 5 a tonne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE all-party report on the coal industry will call for a radical
reorganisation of the UK's energy market with a Pounds 5-a-tonne subsidy to
British Coal as the centrepiece of an ambitious plan to reprieve up to 20 of
the 31 pits under threat.
The subsidy would allow an extra 20m tonnes to be produced above a planned
output of 40m tonnes for two to three years - a formula that will prove
highly controversial for the government.
In total, the cost for 60m tonnes would amount to Pounds 300m a year,
although this would fall as the pits became more competitive in world
markets.
The House of Commons' trade and industry committee has declined to specify
the precise number of pits that might be saved, although it suggests between
18 and 20 could avoid shutdown, at least in the short term.
Its findings, to be finalised today, will influence Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, as he prepares his own solution to the
controversy over the coal industry which began with the announcement of the
closures last October.
The report, due to be formally published on Friday, is almost certain to be
endorsed unanimously by the cross-party committee.
It represents a compromise likely to be acceptable to most of the Commons
and a 'bottom-line' the government will need to meet.
But for some ministers and rightwing Tories, the proposals will be seen as
wildly unrealistic. They will cite last week's independent reports,
commissioned by the government, which broadly endorsed last October's
conclusion that output must be cut.
The Commons' report starts from the premise that the market for UK coal can
be expanded. It calls for a halt to new gas-fired power stations. It also
suggests that, over the next three years, some Pounds 500m to fund subsidies
can be found from savings made by halving the Pounds 1bn set aside in
October to finance redundancies.
In addition, it will propose the reduction of energy imports from France and
domestic open cast coal mining, alongside a ban on imports of orimulsion
from Latin America. There are no proposals to close any of Britain's nuclear
power stations.
Yesterday, the European Commission signalled that new temporary subsidies
should be in order.
But the proposal to cut French imports will almost certainly provoke
protests to Brussels that the UK is breaching competition rules.
Other savings could be made by delaying the deregulation of the regional
electricity market, due to start next year. Postponing deregulation will
extend present arrangements which give British Coal access to 70 per cent of
the domestic power generation market. Under the current timetable its
protected access would be reduced to 50 per cent of the market in 1994.
Last night, it was still unclear what the committee is likely to propose on
the relationship between nuclear power and coal, though there are no calls
for closures of Britain's nuclear power stations.
Many MPs have been pushing for a 'level playing field' between the two
energy sources.
The report is also expected to call on the government to halt any further
licences for new gas-fired power stations in a bid to halt the so-called
'dash-for-gas' that has rapidly reduced coal demand.

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Motor industry warns Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TENTATIVE recovery in the car and commercial vehicle markets will peter
out if Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, raises taxes and does not cut
interest rates further, the Retail Motor Industry Federation said yesterday
in a pre-Budget submission to the Treasury.
The federation warned that motor manufacturers and traders could lose up to
50,000 more jobs in the 12 months to the middle of this year, bringing the
total to nearly 200,000 since the new car market crashed in 1990.
The federation, representing 12,000 dealers and other motor trade
businesses, said it was dismayed by what it saw as the uncertainty being
injected into recovery hopes by the actions of Mr Lamont's department
through 'its continuous media soundings about the acceptability of some tax
increase options'.
Mr David Gent, the federation's director-general, said that 'encouraging
pre-Budget speculation about tax changes is never a sensible way of
conducting economic policy.
'In the present circumstances of continuing recession, with as yet only some
 -though encouraging - signs of possible recovery, to allow the process at
all is utter stupidity. It has to stop and we ask the prime minister and
chancellor to see that it is stopped today.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday said 'very
real signs of recovery' were helping the motor industry.
He told Channel 4 News: 'Britain is being forced, like all other economies,
to be competitive and we are facing the need to modernise industry to
contain our costs.'
Mr Neil Marshall, the federation's director of economic affairs, said the
government had already lost Pounds 3bn in tax revenue as a result of the
slump in car sales since 1989. Last year 1.594m new cars were sold, about
700,000 below the record 2.3m of 1989.
Mr Marshall said sales could recover by 5 per cent to 1.67m this year.

Singer &amp; Friedlander in November, has lured Graham Kane from Touche Remnant
as managing director of both Morgan Grenfell Unit Trust Managers and Morgan
Grenfell Investment Funds.
Kane (right), who had previously been managing director of Touche Remnant's
unit trust operation, had been offered the job of heading the combined unit
trust division following Henderson Administration's purchase of TR from
Societe Generale, but handed in his resignation before taking up the
appointment. He says he is 'more excited' by Morgan - partly because of the
bank's overall investment performance track record; partly because the unit
trust side is only five years old and hence offers greater scope in product
development.
Keith Percy, chief executive of MGAM, says he hopes that 36-year-old Kane
will build up the authorised unit trust side, which currently manages around
Pounds 400m, to Pounds 1bn within five years, partly by acquisition in an
industry that is expected to see considerable consolidation of funds and
fund management groups.
He will also be expanding the range of funds marketed out of the Republic of
Ireland, which currently amount to around Pounds 500m of retail and
institutional monies. Fraher and the team of eight marketing and
administration staff that went with him from Morgan has set up a
Dublin-based company, also to market so-called UCITS funds across European
borders.
Kane says that, given his experience with Societe Generale, he had satisfied
himself that Fraher's departure was not linked to friction with Morgan's
parent Deutsche Bank.
Henderson, which shortly after the acquisition announced it would be making
almost half the staff of TR redundant, has promoted James de Sausmarez into
the position of managing director of a new company charged with the
marketing and business development of the investment trusts of the two
entities. De Sausmarez had previously been managing director of Touche
Remnant Investment Trust Management. At the same time, Alan Gadd, a director
of Henderson Unit Trust Management, becomes marketing director of the retail
division which includes unit and investment trusts as well as private client
business.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Uzbekistan tempted by golden
lure - Steve LeVine on a project that looks likely to overcome the
cash-hungry, ex-Soviet republic's distrust of foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A US company looks likely to win financing for a Dollars 100m project
designed to squeeze six extra tonnes of gold a year from Uzbekistan's rich
mines, thus proving something new about the ex-Soviet republic - it isn't
always infuriatingly obstructionist.
'This project is super-important to the government,' says Mr Marcel DeGuire,
of Newmont Mining Corporation of Denver, Colorado, 'because everybody is
watching it to see if it works.'
So far, few major foreign partnerships have worked out in the Central Asian
nation. But last week Mr Ron Freeman, first vice-president of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said the bank would probably
provide Dollars 70m for the Newmont project; half the remaining Dollars 30m
would come from Newmont and the rest from the Uzbek government.
The gold project, at Uzbekistan's Murantau mine - the world's largest single
gold mine, which produces 50 tonnes a year at a Kizil Kum desert site 250
miles west of Tashkent - would be one of the largest foreign investments in
Uzbekistan since perestroika began. 'I would not recommend this project
unless I thought the government was fully behind it,' Mr Freemand said in
Tashkent.
Foreign interest in Uzbekistan is nothing new. Hundreds of western and
regional traders have paraded through, attracted by the republic's
production of the world's fourth largest cotton crop and the eighth largest
gold output, as well as its large uranium and oil deposits. But little has
come of it. The Uzbek government is probably the most centralised of the 15
former Soviet republics. Officials make virtually no decisions without
President Islam Karimov's express permission and he has been painfully slow
about allowing free enterprise. The visitor finds few of the small-scale
entrepreneurs who offer imported goods from kiosks throughout the Baltics,
the ex-Soviet Slavic countries and the Caucasus.
The government desperately wants foreign investment; it simply has been
slower than others in adjusting to the pace of business outside the former
Soviet Union and mortally fearful of foreign exploitation.
If the Newmont deal goes through, as seems likely, it is probably because it
is a cash-cow that the budget-strapped republic can milk immediately for
hard currency, while at the same time protecting itself from exploitation.
The deal involves extraction of gold from the 150m tonnes of already-mined
rock that has been accumulating in a great pile since 1967, not the mining
of fresh ore.
The government this month did invite foreign bids to develop a new gold
deposit that it said contained about 100 tonnes of gold. The announcement
represented a shift for Mr Karimov. Since independence a year ago,
Uzbekistan has kept its entire 70-tonne annual gold production, instead of
sending it to Russia as it was forced to in the past. According to the
government, Mr Karimov has deposited all the subsequent output into national
reserves, allowing none to be sold.
Some observers claim Mr Karimov approved the bid only because his hand was
forced - gold production has fallen because of supply shortages and
antiquated equipment and he may have decided to cut a deal to help turn
round the declining industry.
No-one can be sure that the president will actually proceed with such a
large gold mining contract, and so it is not at all clear how much, if at
all, Uzbekistan's economic atmosphere has changed.
The Newmont plan calls for the company to import crushers, special plastics
and other equipment for 'heap-leaching' technology, which will extract gold
that otherwise probably could not be economically processed.
Newmont, the largest gold producer in North America, is building a similar
project in Yanacocha, Peru. It is scheduled to come on line later this year
and to produce 100,000 ounces of gold annually.
The company expects the Murantau, Uzbekistan, project to produce six to
seven tonnes of gold the first year, when the richest ore will be exploited,
and five to six tonnes a year after that. The profit will be split 50:50
between Newmont and the government.
Mr DeGuire, who is a metallurgist, said financing terms were still to be
worked out with the European Bank. Mr Freeman said the deal could be
completed in two months. On that schedule, the project would be producing
gold in the second half of next year, Mr DeGuire said.
So how did Newmont pull it off?
Mr DeGuire credited personal relationships that Newmont executives formed
with Uzbek officials, employing a personal touch. When Uzbekistan became
independent, for example, Newmont produced a replica of the nation's new
flag, plus a couple of thousand of commemorative lapel-pins, the first set
of which went to Mr Karimov and his ministers.
'We did a lot of stuff like that. We're also teaching them about cash-flow,
so they know whether it's better to have a dollar now or later,' Mr DeGuire
said. 'This joint venture is a model. It's well balanced. It's a pattern
they can follow for other projects later.'

<TEXT>
SUPERCOMPUTER Systems, an ambitious US supercomputer venture launched five
years ago with plans to build the world's fastest computer, closed its doors
yesterday after failing to raise funds to continue its development work.
The company was founded by Mr Steven Chen, a world-reknown supercomputer
expert when he left Cray Research in 1987. International Business Machines
has funded Supercomputer Systems for the past five years, pouring Dollars
100m into the enterprise.
However, IBM told SSI last month that it would not continue funding the
venture beyond the five-year period to which it had originally agreed.
Mr Chen acknowledged that his supercomputer development was behind schedule,
but said that the company had recently completed a prototype system and had
plans to deliver its first computer in October.
Yesterday, however, SSI's operations were closed and most of the company's
employees were laid off.
An official for the company said that efforts are continuing to raise money,
but that 'there are very few options left, and we're not optimistic.'
Mr Chen said: 'We were left with no alternative but to terminate our project
at this point. Today is a sad day for all of us at SSI.'
Mr Chen said he had been unable to find an investment banker willing to
raise money through a stock offering, and that a worldwide search for new
investors, to provide Dollars 60m needed to continue operations until the
end of 1993, had also failed.
Cray Computer said its new Cray-3 supercomputer system would soon be
available to a limited external user base, Reuter reports.

unit

   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the last pieces in the disposal of the diversified products division
of Italy's Pirelli tyres and cables group fell into place yesterday with the
sale of its STL Superga shoes and clothing subsidiary,
The buyer, a subsidiary of the Milan-based Sopaf investment banking group,
is paying L103bn (Dollars 70m) for the businesses, which involve Pirelli's
Superga shoes and K-Way sports clothing lines.
The transaction will give Pirelli an extraordinary gain of L70bn, to be used
partly to cover extraordinary losses in the 1992 accounts stemming from
restructuring and other costs.
The sale brings to L850bn the amount raised in disposals from Pirelli's
diversified products division and other activities, notably property.
The company has set a L1,000bn target for sell-offs by mid-1993.
Pirelli has sold seven of the nine business units in its diversified
products division. The operation was put on the block to raise cash after
the failure of Pirelli's takeover bid for Continental, its German rival, in
November 1991. The two units still to be sold involve transmission belts,
hoses and some minor activities.
The latest disposal will reduce Pirelli's group debt by about L160bn, as the
purchasers are also taking around L57bn in STL Superga debt.
In December 1990, Pirelli bought the French K-Way, also run by STL Superga,
to broaden its consumer products activities. Pirelli will retain an indirect
interest in Superga through Pirelli &amp; C, its ultimate holding company.
Pirelli &amp; C will take around 12 per cent of Superga.

Allied-Lyons, the food and drinks company, is establishing a joint venture
in India with Tata Tea, India's largest tea producer, for marketing tea in
India and in export markets.
The partners are investing Rs100m (Pounds 2.24m) in a new factory in Cochin,
south India, which will produce packet tea and teabags.
The two companies plan to launch round tea bags later this year and in new
export markets, including countries in the Middle East, eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union.
Lyons Tetley has been buying tea from Tata for many years. Last year the
British company bought its entire requirement of instant tea for the US, one
of Lyons Tetley's biggest markets, from the company.

5%
</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Montedison, Ferruzzi's chemicals arm, fell nearly 5 per cent
yesterday following suggestions that ENI, the Italian state oil concern, had
taken their 1990 Enimont deal to arbitration.
In November 1990, after long negotiations, ENI agreed to buy Montedison's 40
per cent stake in their jointly-run chemicals and petrochemicals group,
Enimont.
However, Ferruzzi denied the report in Il Mundo magazine that ENI was
seeking up to L800bn (Dollars 580m) in compensation for the Enimont deal as
'gratuitously inaccurate'. ENI refused to comment.
Arbitration procedures were built into the sale of Montedison's stake to ENI
for L2,805bn; yesterday, ENI was coy about confirming whether it invoked the
arbitration panel  - and, if so, in what context.
The spotlight has also been turned on the Enimont affair, engineered when Mr
Raul Gardini still headed Ferruzzi, after Rome magistrates reopened an
enquiry into the treatment of minority shareholders. This enquiry is
believed to have been prompted by magistrates following up leads on alleged
political kick-backs in the wake of the Milan corruption scandal.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Czechs and Slovaks hurry towards currency split: Economic
strains have forced the two republics to hasten plans for a monetary divorce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS than a month after the peaceful break-up of the former Czechoslovakia
the two newly independent states are preparing for a currency split which
will underline their economic differences.
The original plan worked out between Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime
minister, and Mr Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart, imagined that the
two countries would be able to keep a common currency until early summer.
Only then would they split, with the new Czech and Slovak crowns
interchangeable and equally valuable until such time as market forces
determined their future parities.
In practice, expectations that the Slovak crown would be worth less than the
Czech crown have resulted in increasing strain on the joint currency
arrangement. This led to a recent run on the banks as individuals and
companies in both republics exchanged crowns for foreign currencies.
The net result has been a decision to bring forward the currency split,
which is now expected within the next few days. In anticipation of the split
the monetary authorities have begun marking their own banknotes, prompting
anxious savers to deposit all their spare cash in the banks while foreign
institutions have stopped buying crowns in an attempt to reduce stockpiles
of old notes.
According to a study by PlanEcon, the US-based research and consultancy
group, the Slovak crown may need a 25 per cent devaluation against the Czech
crown to remain competitive. This will be a hard pill to swallow for the
Slovak government, for political as well as economic reasons.
But it is not only the currency which is feeling the strain. Businessmen are
complaining of growing bureaucracy while the introduction of value-added tax
has caused a public outcry over unexpectedly high price increases. Later
this year a new bankruptcy law is expected to lead to widespread closures
and higher unemployment.
Businessmen claim trading between the two countries has become much more
difficult and costly because of extra bureaucracy and customs regulations.
Companies which import goods produced in the other republic have to go
through a cumbersome process to cover VAT rules and customs' clearance.
Some Czech exporters complain of endless delay and problems with shipments
sent back to Prague by over-zealous customs officers.
Both governments are also finding that keeping inflation under control will
be more difficult than expected as the introduction of VAT on January 1 will
add 6-8 percentage points on prices this year.
VAT was introduced as part of a broad tax reform to modernise the economy
but led to sharper than expected price rises. According to the Czech
statistical office the average price of food rose 8 per cent over the first
two weeks of the year while the price of coal and cement for industry rose
22 per cent and 27 per cent respectively. This will have a knock-on effect
throughout the economy.
The Czech government expects inflation of 15-17 per cent this year, though
some economists say it will be closer to 25 per cent. Slovakia has seen
similar price rises. Both governments say they will not reintroduce price
controls, though neither has completely ruled this out.
Unemployment is also expected to rise as restructuring of industry deepens
and mass privatisation, at least in the Czech republic, accelerates the
labour shake-out. Until now the Czech republic, with unemployment of 2.57
per cent, claims the lowest rate in Europe. But trade unions expect
joblessness to rise to between 6 and 8 per cent in the Czech republic and
from more than 11 to 14 per cent in Slovakia.

FT  26 JAN 93 / New coalition moves in Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE reconfirmed moderate leadership of Hungary's ruling Democratic Forum
(HDF) yesterday began the task of building a new conservative coalition
capable of winning the 1994 general elections.
'We have to go for the moderate voters, it is the only chance,' an aide to
Mr Jozsef Antall, the prime minister, said yesterday, after the weekend
party congress rejected a right-wing attempt to shift the party towards a
more nationalist and xenophobic position. 'Hungarians are 60-70 per cent
moderate. If you want to win you have to go for them.'
The campaign for the floating voter is likely to see Mr Antall's
conservatives emphasise their edge in experience and challenge the
opposition to say how they could have better managed the economically
troubled years since the 1990 elections. 'We have to convince the voters
that there is no alternative,' the aide added. 'Nobody else in the region
has done any better than this government.'
But opposition politicians yesterday doubted that the Forum had sufficiently
healed its internal differences to rebound after the congress. Mr Viktor
Orban, leader of the opposition Young Democrat party, praised the prime
minister's tactical success in holding the party together and his verbal
confrontation with Mr Istvan Csurka, leader of the ultra-nationalists. 'But
the fact is that Csurka and Antall remain in the same party.
'It is as if Jacques Chirac, the French conservative leader, and Jean-Marie
Le Pen, the French ultra-nationalist, were in government together,' Mr Orban
added.
Many believe the performance of the economy under the Forum's stewardship
will prove more important for the elections than the outcome of the
congress. 'People's feelings about their personal circumstances: that's what
matters. That is where the election will be decided,' Mr Laszlo Medgyasszay,
a Forum presidium member, said.
The prime minister's success at the congress leaves the conservative
coalition he formed in 1990 in a stronger position to continue to the end of
its term and reinforce its position as eastern Europe's longest-lasting and
most stable government.
But The Forum, which languishes at a humiliating 8 per cent in the opinion
polls, still faces an uphill struggle to attract new coalition partners and
voters nervous about the ultra-nationalists who remain on the right wing of
the party.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour warns on R&amp;D spending
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK will suffer because of the sharp fall in spending on research and
development in recent years, Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry
secretary, warned yesterday.
Government figures showed that in 1991 the UK had lost 10 per cent of its
spending and workforce in R&amp;D. The government's contribution had fallen by
22 per cent, Mr Cook said.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories urge caution on Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE renewed fighting in Bosnia yesterday triggered fresh warnings from Tory
MPs that Britain should be prepared to withdraw its troops at short notice,
Philip Stephens writes.
With concern growing on the Conservative back benches about the risk to
British troops, Mr George Walden, a former minister, caught the general mood
with the comment: 'At any moment we have to be ready to pull out.'
Mr Peter Viggers, Tory MP for Gosport, warned that British soldiers who had
been sent to Bosnia on a humanitarian mission could soon find themselves
drawn into a 'peace-keeping' role. He said 'very many' colleagues had told
him they agreed the government should keep open the option of early
withdrawal.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lottery bill attacked by Labour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S national lottery bill was 'the unacceptable face of
nationalisation', Labour said yesterday during Commons exchanges concerning
the bill's possible effects on employment in competing industries.
In the debate before the bill paving the way for the new lottery received
its second Commons reading, Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow heritage secretary, charged
the government with wrecking 'a perfectly reasonable proposition' through
its insensitivity.
Citing concern among MPs about the effects of a lottery on the football
pools industry, Ms Clwyd said the government had offered no safeguards as to
the future of a large number of private-sector jobs.
Labour preferred to put its faith in the established positions that the
pools industry provided rather than speculation about the number of jobs the
national lottery might create, she said. 'A job in the hand is worth more
than a job in the bush.'
Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, said the bill would establish 'a new
multi-billion pound business' - an enterprise that would create around 1,000
'core' jobs in its central operation and many others in associated service
industries.
He confirmed reports that a confidential study commissioned by the
government had indicated the pools industry might lose 1,100 jobs
attributable to the lottery under certain circumstances, but said this
conclusion assumed pools companies did nothing to change the management of
their operations in response.
In fact, the pools sector had already responded to the potential threat
which the lottery poses.
'The pools are well able to adapt to change in order to preserve their own
interests.'
In an attempt to dispel Labour fears that the funds distributed by the
lottery might in effect act as a substitute for public spending, Mr Brooke
promised that proceeds would not be brought within the government control
total.
This point was underlined by Mr David Mellor, former heritage secretary, who
spoke of the need for it to be clear the government was not trying to
'slough off' responsibility for arts, sport and heritage.
Mr Mellor said that the only basis on which he could commend to the many
bodies that wanted the lottery that it would be a good thing was if the
undertaking not to use it as a substitute for public funds was 'honoured to
the letter'.
He said: 'The national lottery is only worth something if it is a quantum
leap forward for these interests. Otherwise I do not think we want it'.
Unlawful participation in foreign lotteries meant that the choice at issue
was not between one lottery or none 'but between benefit from the lottery in
the UK and benefit abroad,' Mr Brooke said.
A Labour amendment describing the bill as unacceptable in the form proposed
was defeated by 310 votes to 269, a government majority of 41.
The bill then received a second reading by 339-203, a government majority of
136, with Labour MPs being given a free vote.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Shipping lobby renews tax relief
campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cross-party campaign urging tax breaks for Britain's shipping industry
has been renewed in the run-up to the Budget.
An all-party Commons motion, launched by the Ulster Unionists and signed by
33 MPs so far, calls for the establishment of a maritime enterprise zone and
reiterates the industry's call for 100 per cent capital allowances and
relief for employers on income tax or national insurance contributions on
seafarers' earnings.
Signatories include Mr David Shaw, the Tory MP for Dover, and Sir Rhodes
Boyson, a member of the executive of the 1922 Tory backbench committee.
The last serious attempt to win tax concessions for the industry came in the
1991 budget process when more than 100 Tory MPs supported the proposals.
Although campaigners believe that 30 Tory MPs is a more realistic target
this time, as the suggestions put forward are more specific, the
government's overall Commons majority of just 21 MPs means that even about a
dozen Tories determined to pursue the matter could cause difficulties.
Tory MPs with an interest in shipping are already raising the issue in their
individual pre-Budget discussions with Treasury ministers. After a meeting
next week between representatives from the Chamber of Shipping, the
industry's trade association, and Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial
secretary, the MPs will consider whether to make representations directly to
the prime minister.
Campaigners have been cheered by the fact that Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, has asked for details of their complaint of unfair competition
in European shipping, with other EC countries giving greater incentives.
The industry believes its cause is helped by the position being starker than
before, and warns that unless help is given there will be no British-flagged
ships by the next election.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: A passion for trains that could
derail BR policy - Philip Stephens profiles Tory backbencher Robert Adley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE CABINET minister describes him as 'quite simply barmy'. A colleague on
the Tory backbenches says the problem is that he never outgrew a boyhood
passion for train sets.
But amid growing concern on the Tory backbenches about privatisation of
British Rail, those less-than-flattering judgments of Mr Robert Adley, the
MP for Christchurch, may disguise a more awkward truth for the government.
Mr Adley, a self-confessed railway fanatic turned Tory chairman of the
influential Commons backbench transport committee, has emerged as one of the
sharpest - and most dangerous - critics of thegovernment's BR strategy.
Last week his all-party committee produced a damning, if carefully coded,
assessment of the Department of Transport's plans to sell off BR's freight
business and to inject private sector competition into passenger services.
A still-sharper attack is promised during the lengthy Commons debate on the
privatisation bill published by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary.
If things go to plan Mr Adley will wage a guerrilla war against Mr MacGregor
as the bill winds its way through parliament during the next six months.
It is possible, just possible, that he will recruit another dozen or so
Conservative colleagues to his cause.
If he does, the government will be forced yet again to take its proposals
for privatisation back to the drawing board.
It is hard to deny that Mr Adley has eclectic tastes. During 20 years in the
House of Commons his political causes have ranged from passionate support
for the communist Chinese in their disputes with Vietnam to ardent, and
early, support for the ANC in South Africa.
An author of nine books on the age of steam railways who once filled his
garden with rail signalling equipment might also be said to be obsessive
about the cause of the railways. But if his hostility to the government's
plans for BR is founded on the assumption that rail is a superior form of
travel there is more to his case than mere nostalgia.
Mr Adley foresees another damaging episode in the post-war decline of rail
travel. In the process the government will alienate millions of natural
supporters - commuters and the users of rural BR lines - in the next general
election. It was Mr Adley who coined the phrase that the government's plans
would lead to 'a poll tax on wheels'.
He is relaxed about being branded an eccentric: 'I take it as quite a
compliment that I am being vilified. When ministers resort to personal
attacks it is a sure sign they are skating on thin ice.'
He is similarly dismissive about Mr MacGregor's claim that the government's
proposals have the overwhelming support of the Tory benches: 'When ministers
insist they have 100 per cent support it is usually because they haven't'
Mr Adley insists that he is not against competition - or privatisation. He
suggests that the government should scrap the 1947 act on which BR's
monopoly is based and establish a Rail Ombudsman to oversee fair competition
between BR and private-sector companies: 'What I want is a better railway'.
But the starting point should be a fundamental re-assessment of all forms of
transport and include a realistic judgment of the true costs of roads. Rail
subsidies are deemed bad but the economic, social and environmental costs of
the roads are ignored: 'The real problem is that we do not have a transport
policy in this country.'
Mr Adley is adamant that Mr MacGregor's plans for BR - selling off the
freight division, creating a new track authority and offering operating
franchises on individual lines - will not work.
Thus far the government has been unimpressed. But there is a niggling
suspicion at Westminster that Mr Adley may yet turn out to be one of those
mavericks with more than a fair share of common sense.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM wins friends and influences
people - Ralph Atkins sees paths to business eased in India
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONTINENT or two away from home, a million miles from balance of payments
or unemployment figures, Mr John Major has found it is possible to win
converts to his style.
'I thought until the weekend like the average voter - that Major was grey.
But we're terribly impressed,' said a director from one of Britain's larger
companies as he circulated in the marquee at the high commissioner's
residence in Delhi.
Perhaps it was a sign of how neglected UK industrialists have felt, that
just by listening to the business delegation accompanying him, the prime
minister won friends.
'The French and the Germans are so able here that we had to do something,'
said the same director, who heaped praise on Mr Major, perhaps by his
comments betraying a touch of fatalism.
The trip is about micro-economics, not macro-policy. At a cocktail party on
the flight Mr Major heard of individual problems with India's cumbersome
labour laws, import tariffs and repatriating the profits of subsidiaries.
The flight was intimate and chummy. The 13 invited businessmen included
chairmen and executives from British Gas, Rolls-Royce, National Power and
ICI. A group talking would turn to find the first lord of the Treasury
brushing past down the aisles to find officials or talk to the press.
'When I chatted to him on the plane he was asking detailed questions about
what our priorities were,' said Mr Douglas Gadd, chairman of GEC Alsthom,
the manufacturing group which is looking for a deal in the electricity
transmission industry. 'His presence has certainly opened doors that
wouldn't otherwise have been opened.'
That extra access has been easy to see. The business delegation met eight of
India's most senior civil servants for tea on Sunday afternoon. Yesterday
they met ministers for commerce, defence, economics, industrial development,
power and home affairs before reporting to a session headed by Mr Major and
Mr P V Narismha Rao, the Indian prime minister.
India made clear its priorities were investment in infrastructure - matching
the Department of Trade and Industry's focus on energy, telecommunications
and heavy manufacturing, as well as the banks needed to arrange financing.
Beneath the expression of public support, however, many of the businessmen
were not prepared to admit that overseas trips could be anything but an
adjunct to the central thrust of economic policy. Lower UK interest rates
and extra money for export credit guarantees remain prime concerns -
particularly for Mr Howard Davies, the director-general of the Confederation
of British Industry, who has balanced his enthusiasm for the trip with
barbed jokes about government policy. He told Mr Major that industry wanted
to see government officials more receptive to industry in the UK - and not
just in India.
The Whitehall public-relations machine has worked hard against Indian
bureaucracy - or perhaps genuine reluctance by the country's government and
businessmen - to set up a handy series of announcements to help ease
criticism of the trip by Mr Major's political opponents at home.
But not until long after Mr Major has returned to domestic politics will
trip's real value, in terms of export and investment orders won, be
apparent.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Sales estimates low, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AMOUNT of money the planned national lottery could raise has been
seriously underestimated, according to Opax International, the security
printing group which supplies tickets for 40 state lotteries around the
world.
Opax says suggestions that ticket sales could be Pounds 1.5bn a year in the
UK are much too low - sales could exceed Pounds 3bn and continue to climb
'with the right product mix, organisation and marketing'.
Mr Glyn Owen Hughes, director of operations for the Leeds-based group, says
its estimates are based on the experience of other lotteries. He points out
that German lottery sales before the integration of the former East German
lotteries totalled Pounds 4.8bn in 1991 - Pounds 81 per head each year. The
equivalent spending per head in the UK would generate lottery sales of
Pounds 4.6bn.
'People do not seem to realise how big the UK national lottery could be,' Mr
Owen Hughes says.
The proceeds of the lottery are intended to be allocated to five 'good
causes': sport, the arts, national heritage, charities and a number of
projects to mark the millenium.
Opax International, part of the Bowater group, said a lottery should not
affect charities adversely. And evidence from countries such as Italy,
Denmark and Finland suggested that the lottery and football pools could
co-exist.
It argues that levels of taxation are important to the success of a national
lottery. 'Where the level of taxation begins to affect the value of the
prize fund, the lottery's . . . success is put at risk,' Opax says.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Renewed doubts over economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEEBLE rise in bank and building society lending last month suggests that
the lowest base rates for 16 years have done little to entice people and
companies to borrow more.
Weak M4 lending, and the prospect of further heavy job cuts in the
construction industry, yesterday cast new doubt on the strength of the
economy.
But reports of improved optimism among businesses, further signs of a slight
upturn in the housing market and buoyant growth of cash and notes in
circulation indicated that some sort of recovery may be under way.
Yesterday's mixed signals on the UK economy will not make it any easier for
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to decide whether to cut base rates below
7 per cent ahead of the Budget on March 16.
Bank of England figures showed that M4 lending rose by Pounds 200m last
month, an improvement on the November figure when lending fell by Pounds
600m, but significantly less than economists' expectations.
The annual growth rate of M4 - notes and coins in circulation plus bank and
building society deposits - was similarly sluggish. It hit a record low and
dropped through the bottom limit of the government's recently announced
monitor range of 4-8 per cent.
M4 fell a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent on the month, to rise by 3.7 per
cent in the year to December. This compares with 4.6 per cent in the year to
November.
By contrast narrow money, which comprises mainly notes and coins in
circulation, rose by 0.2 per cent in December, taking the
seasonally-adjusted annual growth to 3 per cent.
Weekly figures for notes and coins in circulation indicate that the buoyancy
of M0 has continued this month with some economists estimating that the
annual rate for January will exceed 4 per cent.
Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment
bank, said the discrepancy between the two sets of figures could be
explained by debt overhang.
The Treasury said two special factors had depressed the growth of M4 last
month; the purchase of debt by the government from British
Telecommunications and the electricity holding companies, and the switch by
big companies to monthly payments of value added tax.
Figures from the British Bankers Association yesterday confirmed the
sluggish nature of private and corporate sector lending. Total sterling
lending by the nine biggest UK banking groups to the UK private sector fell
by more than Pounds 1.7bn in December, the second fall in four months.

A PRIVATE fund to contribute towards the restoration of Windsor Castle after

Mr Brooke, who provoked criticism from some Labour MPs for immediately
offering government money to rebuild the castle, said that the cost of
clearing up the site and making it safe would be about Pounds 1.5m, and that
while it was too early to estimate the total costs, there was 'no reason to
suppose' they would be as high as the often-quoted Pounds 60m.

MINISTERS' reluctance to proceed with statutory regulation of the press was
underlined yesterday when Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary,
said the response of newspaper editors to the Calcutt report had been

Editors agreed last week to strengthen the press complaints commission by

During questions on national heritage Tory MPs were divided on whether a
more powerful form of regulation was required.

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: CBI survey finds confidence in business outlook
has increased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING orders are continuing to fall, although at the lowest rate for
2 1/2 years, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday.
The CBI's quarterly industrial trends survey, published yesterday, found
that confidence about the outlook for business has increased significantly
over the past four months, even though factory investment is still
declining.
The proportion of companies operating below capacity is 73 per cent, the
lowest figure recorded since January 1983.
Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economics committee as well as
chairman and chief executive of engineering group GKN, said the mood was
'more positive'. Even so, there was no guarantee that the recession was
ending.
He said that several times during the recession a rise in business optimism
had proved to be a false dawn.
Mr John Major, heading a delegation of UK businessmen in India, said the
rise in confidence was 'dramatic' and that export growth would lead Britain
out of recession. The prime minister said 'one missing ingredient' needed to
end the recession had been stronger confidence in business.
More than 1,100 companies answered questions in the survey, which was
conducted between December 21 and January 11.
New orders were lower in the past four months than in the previous four
months for 35 per cent of manufacturers, allowing for seasonal variations.
The 22 per cent to report an increase in orders gave a negative balance of
13 percentage points. That compared with a negative balance of 28 points in
the previous survey in October.
Manufacturers are more hopeful about orders over the next four months, with
a difference of 13 points between companies expecting orders to climb and
those anticipating a fall.
Even though optimism about export prospects has changed little since
October, the balance of companies expecting increased export orders over the
next four months comes out at a relatively healthy 18 points. That compares
with a balance of 6 points in October.
The increased confidence about exports sparked by the devaluation of
sterling last September has been only feebly translated into actual orders.
A balance of 11 percentage points said export orders over the past four
months had declined, compared with the previous four months. That was only
slightly more encouraging than the balance of 19 points recorded last
October.
More companies expect to reduce their spending on buildings and machinery
over the next 12 months compared with those which think they will increase
it. The balance expecting to make cuts is lower than it was last October,
however. The CBI expects total manufacturing investment in mid 1993 to be
nearly 40 per cent below its peak in mid 1989.
Unit costs have increased only slightly since the last survey while the CBI
says the squeeze on profit margins has remained tight, as indicated by the
balance of just 11 points of companies expecting to increase prices over the
next four months.

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Touche will shed about 20 partners
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUCHE ROSS, the sixth largest UK accountancy firm, is to shed about 20
partners at the end of its financial year in mid-April. The action is
believed to have been prompted partly by the recession, which has hit most
accountancy firms.
Mr John Roques, senior partner, confirmed yesterday that about 20 partners
would be leaving 'by mutual agreement', and about 10 new professionals would
be elected to partnership.
In line with normal practice, several partners will leave because they have
reached the firm's mandatory retirement age, which varies between 60 and 65,
depending on individual contracts. But about half of those leaving are
younger, and will take early retirement following discussions with the
firm's management board.

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Unions to challenge 1.5% pay ceiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC SECTOR unions representing nearly 1m council manual workers yesterday
issued a challenge to the government's 1.5 per cent pay rise ceiling, Lisa
Wood writes.
Mr Roger Poole, general-secretary of Nupe, the public services union, said a
meeting of local government manual unions yesterday had decided that this
year's pay claim 'will be prepared without regard to the limit'.
A similar message will be delivered today by leaders of 750,000 local
government white-collar workers. Nalgo representatives will tell employers
that the limit is 'unfair and unjustifiable'.
The Local Government Management Board, which negotiates on behalf of
councils, said yesterday that this year's government grant meant some local
authorities could not afford 1.5 per cent.
The board said: 'Whatever union leaders might be saying at this early stage,
the fact is that if local authorities agree to more than they can afford it
is the staff and the local communities who end up paying with reduced
services and more job losses.'

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Consumer borrowing weak despite interest rate
cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOWEST interest rates for 16 years have done little to entice people to
borrow more.
Bank of England figures showed that M4 lending rose by Pounds 200m last
month, an improvement on the November figure when lending fell by Pounds
600m, but significantly less than economists' expectations.
The annual growth rate of M4 - notes and coins in circulation plus bank and
building society deposits - was similarly sluggish. It hit a record low and
dropped through the bottom limit of the government's recently announced
monitor range of 4 per cent to 8 per cent.
M4 fell a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent on the month, to rise by 3.7 per
cent in the year to December. This compares with 4.6 per cent in the year to
November. In contrast, narrow money - which comprises mainly notes and coins
in circulation - rose by 0.2 per cent in December, taking the seasonally
adjusted annual growth to 3 per cent - just inside the 1 per cent to 4 per
cent target range.
The latest figures on the economy leave the government in a conundrum. The
poor credit figures, along with dismal unemployment and manufacturing output
figures last week, suggest further base rate cuts are necessary to stimulate
activity.
Weekly figures for notes and coins in circulation indicate that the buoyancy
of M0 has continued this month with some economists estimating that the
annual rate for January will exceed 4 per cent.
Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, the US investment
bank, said the discrepancy between the two sets of figures could be
explained by debt overhang. 'M0 captures those areas of the economy where
debt is not a problem, while M4 and M4 lending capture the fragility of
those areas of the economy, such as housing and business investment, that
rely on expanding credit,' he said.
The Treasury said two special factors had depressed the growth of M4 last
month - the purchase of debt by the government from British
Telecommunications and the electricity holding companies, and the switch by
big companies to monthly payments of VAT.
Figures from the British Bankers Association yesterday confirmed the
sluggish nature of private and corporate sector lending.
Total sterling lending by the nine biggest UK banking groups to the UK
private sector fell by more than Pounds 1.7bn in December, the second fall
in four months.

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Mortgage lending rise signals housing upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER SIGNS of a slight upturn in the housing market emerged yesterday in
figures from the Building Societies Association showing a rise in the number
of people committing themselves to taking out mortgages in December.
The number of net new commitments - when a borrower accepts an offer of a
mortgage advance - rose to Pounds 1.987bn in December from Pounds 1.849bn in
November. Gross mortgage lending increased to Pounds 2.242bn for the month,
up from Pounds 2.087bn in November.
Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the association, said it was likely that
the fourth quarter had marked a 'watershed' for the housing market as the
impact of lower interest rates started to affect the confidence of
housebuyers.
But Mr Boleat said the weak state of the housing market last year was
reflected by the fact that gross mortgage advances for the year of Pounds
33.585bn were 20 per cent down on the figure of Pounds 42.024bn for 1991.
Separately, societies managed to stem the outflow of retail funds following
cuts in base rates during the last quarter of the year. The net retail
inflow was Pounds 117m in December, against a net outflow of Pounds 184m in
November.
Although societies managed to avoid a net outflow of retail funds for 1992,
the net receipts for the year were only Pounds 295m, the lowest figure since
1961. Savings balances rose by Pounds 12bn, however, as interest earned
remained in accounts.
Mr Boleat said the rise in net new commitment during December was 'an
encouraging sign'. It was against the seasonal norm of a fall in buying in
December, and so supported evidence of a recovery in activity, he said.

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Builders set to lose 50,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER 50,000 jobs are expected to be shed by the construction industry
this year, taking the total to 500,000 since 1989, according to a survey
published yesterday.
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said the
industry had lost the equivalent of almost 600 jobs every working day since
summer 1989.
The confederation questioned more than 500 building companies about the
outlook for output and employment during the next 12 months. Just under half
of those questioned said they expected to announce more job losses by the
end of March.
Almost a fifth of companies reported that they were working at less than
half capacity. Two thirds said they had enough work to last only six months.
Sir Brian said the findings of the confederation's latest quarterly workload
survey showed that the industry remained in deep recession in spite of a few
brighter signs.
These included a rise in the number of visitors to houses for sale, and more
than a quarter of companies recording an increase in inquiries for work from
potential customers against 21 per cent reporting a fall. This is the first
positive balance since the second quarter of 1989.
The rise in inquiries and visitors still had to be translated into sales,
however. As a result the industry was forecasting a further fall in output
of 2 per cent this year, following declines of 6 per cent last year and 9
per cent in 1991.
'Whatever is happening in other sectors of industry it is clear from these
results that construction remains in serious recession,' Sir Brian said.
'The key indicators of output and employment are still pointing firmly
downwards and we have to face the appalling prospect that the construction
jobless total will reach the half-a-million mark during 1993.'
This would mean a 30 per cent cut in the industry's labour force since
summer 1989. More than 20,000 construction companies had failed since then,
half of them in the past 12 months.
The confederation appealed to the chancellor to help construction by cutting
interest rates further, reducing value added tax for house improvements, and
abolishing stamp duty in the March Budget.
It also wants the government to extend the period for which it will allow 20
per cent capital allowances on industrial and agricultural buildings ordered
before October 31 this year.
Sir Brian said the industry was enduring the worst recession in living
memory: 'Assuming we have confidence returning, then by the end of 1993, and
one hopes in 1994, construction will show recovery.'

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Economy: Deutsche Bank seeks to join Chaps system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE BANK, the biggest bank in Germany, has applied to become a UK
clearing bank by joing Chaps, the electronic system for clearing and
settling high value bank payments.
If Deutsche is successful - bankers said yesterday it was likely to be  - it
would become the first Continental bank to have a clearing account at the
Bank of England. Banks' debts and credits to each other, resulting from
Chaps transactions, are cleared at the end of each working day at the Bank
of England.
It also emerged yesterday that six other Continental banks, including Credit
Lyonnais, France's biggest bank, have made approaches to Chaps with a view
to becoming clearers in London. A banker said two or three of these would
probably become members.
Foreign banks have traditionally done their sterling clearing by using UK
banks, such as Barclays or National Westminster, as their agents. They have
had the right to join Chaps for several years but only Citibank of the US
has exercised it.
Deutsche Bank's move appears to represent a vote of confidence in the future
of London as a financial centre. Bankers said this was encouraging, given
that doubts had been expressed about the City of London's ability to remain
the leading European financial centre following sterling's withdrawal last
year from the exchange rate mechanism and the government's lukewarm attitude
to monetary union.
Deutsche's approval is likely in the next two months.

Incomes Data Services, the employment research organisation, said most pay
settlements monitored so far in the private sector gave rises between 2 per
cent and 5 per cent.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Government to set up urban development corporation for
Plymouth docks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is to set up an urban development corporation to help
regenerate the rundown docklands of Plymouth, Anthony Moreton writes.
It will spend Pounds 45m in an area which includes vacant Ministry of
Defence land.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, did not say whether the
funding would be new money or recycled from other parts of his department's
budget. It will be the 12th development corporation set up in England.
At the same conference in London, Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said a
decision on whether to extend the five-year-old initiative to aid the
industrial valleys of south Wales, would be taken 'in the next few weeks'.
He added that the area had performed significantly better than the UK over
the past five years as far as unemployment, clearance of derelict land, new
factories and new private-sector investment were concerned.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Hoover outlines agreement to save Glasgow plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOOVER, the US domestic appliance group, yesterday outlined details of the
agreement reached with union representatives last week at its plant at
Cambuslang, near Glasgow. Hoover believes it can now turn its lossmaking
European operations back into profit.
The agreement, formally announced yesterday between the company and the AEEU
engineering and electrical union at its 1,000-strong Cambuslang plant, is
designed to make it one of the most cost-effective in Europe. Hoover said
yesterday that the changes will double annual output to about 1.8m units.
The company confirmed that 400 jobs would be created at the plant as a
result of the agreement, with production being transferred from its plant at
Dijon in France, which would be closed with the loss of 600 jobs.
Mr Bill Froust, Hoover's European president, said the Cambuslang agreement
safeguarded the plant's future and was designed to improve the company's
operating costs.
The agreement is far-reaching in its assertion of management authority,
although Hoover will continue to recognise the union. However, the company
said it requires flexibility from its staff and the elimination of all
restrictive practices and local union agreements.
Under the deal, employees will work as directed by the supervisors and a new
common job description will be introduced. Hoover also said that it will
regularly evaluate the cost of manufacturing components or sub-assemblies
in-house and compare it with the cost of contracting out the work.
Under the deal, Hoover reserves the right to fix shift patterns for staff.
It said that manning levels would reflect operational needs. The agreement
says that union activity in the plant will be reduced, with the position of
senior shop steward being abolished. The position of a single full-time
convener is to be reviewed. The deal stipulates that union representation
will not exceed an average of one representative for every 70 hourly paid
workers.
Hoover said it would not accept any stoppage or any other form of industrial
disruption until the provisions of its procedure agreement had been
exhausted. It warned that any worker who failed to honour this faced summary
dismissal.
Pay is being frozen until the beginning of next year and the premium shift
rate is being cut from 156 per cent to 133 per cent, the industry norm.
Hoover said that from the beginning of next month, all new employees would
be hired initially on two-year temporary contracts without benefits such as
sickness payments.
Many of the new conditions were introduced by Hoover at its white-goods
plant at Merthyr Tydfil, South Glamorgan, in May 1991.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Classic FM set to silence sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATER this week Classic FM is expected to show that broadcasting 'the
world's most beautiful music' has the makings of a beautiful little
business.
Rajar, the new joint radio industry research body, will announce on Friday
its first findings and is expected to show that Classic, the UK's first
national commercial station, has attracted more than 4m listeners a week.
Classic said before its launch on September 7 that it would reach 2.8m
listeners a week.
In spite of the depth of the advertising recession, Classic has already
either taken or booked revenues of about Pounds 3.5m in advertising and
sponsorship - more than some people forecast it would earn in a year.
In the early weeks the advertisments came mainly from the music industry.
Now they have broadened to include financial services, travel and cars -
reflecting the fact that 60 per cent of the station's audience comes from
the ABC1 marketing categories.
Capital costs were Pounds 6.3m with running costs about Pounds 7m a year.
Breakeven seems very likely next year and has not been totally ruled out
this year.
When Mr John Spearman, former chairman of advertising agency Collet
Dickenson Pearce, sounded out friends in the media about whether he should
accept an offer to run Classic FM, the advice was unanimous. He was told:
'Don't touch it with a barge pole.'
The consensus was that a commercial radio station devoted to classical music
could not possibly work in the UK and might never get on air.
The apparent size of the challenge, combined with the commitment of
shareholders such as Time Warner, the world's largest media group,
Associated Newspapers, and GWR, the commercial radio group, persuaded Mr
Spearman to become chief executive.
Purists have sniffed at the occasional mispronunciation of a composer's
name. But Mr Spearman is likely to have the last laugh. 'We are a serious
national ABC1 medium. We will be quite difficult for advertisers to
overlook,' he says.

FT  26 JAN 93 / PSA privatisation reaches the final stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday launched the final stage of the privatisation of
the Property Services Agency. It announced the sale of PSA's five building
management businesses, which conduct most of the maintenance and upkeep of
government buildings.
The five businesses, based in Edinburgh, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol and
London, employ 9,000 people and should have a combined fee income of Pounds
311m in this financial year.
The announcement comes two months after the controversial sale of the
agency's projects division to Tarmac, which will cost the government up to
Pounds 90m to cover liabilities and redundancy costs.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm advising the government, said the
management businesses were considerably healthier than the project division.
Mr Andrew Jordan, a partner, said he believed that the prices commanded by
the businesses would more than offset the redundancy costs the government
had agreed to pay.
The businesses are all in profit. For the past 15 months they have been
under the temporary management of Bovis which aimed to improve their
efficiency, systems and customer relations. Mr Jordan said: 'They are
remarkably good given they are government departments. They are surprisingly
commercial.'
The businesses have lost contracts over the past few years following the
decision to allow the private sector to compete for government business.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand said the companies expected to make up for the lost
business over the next five years by competing actively for new work.
The sale, to be conducted by competitive tender, will be advertised
throughout the European Community. Mr John Redwood, environment minister,
said he would prefer to sell each of the five businesses to a different
buyer, although bids for more than one business would be allowed.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand said it had received interest from more than 70
businesses, including contractors, consultants, utilities and building
management companies. Preliminary bids will be submitted by March 9, after
which final offers will be invited from shortlisted bidders.
The guidelines for the sale provide that the deal should look after the
interests of clients, taxpayers and staff. Coopers &amp; Lybrand said it would
try to sell to a buyer able to provide the maximum number of jobs and one
with sufficient financial strength to honour redundancy obligations. The
government will guarantee redundancy payments in the event of the buyer
going bankrupt in the next five years.
After the sale of the building management businesses, the sole remaining
part of the PSA in the Department of the Environment will be Property
Holdings.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Warning over lack of cover for exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTERS will suffer a 'substantial competitive disadvantage' unless the
government rejoins other European states in providing exporters with
reinsurance against political risks, such as coups, warns Trade Indemnity,
the UK credit insurance group.
In a report to the Department of Trade and Industry, published esterday,
Trade Indemnity calls on the government to work in partnership with private
insurers to provide reinsurance cover at commercial rates.
It calls for this cover to be extended to all private-sector insurers able
to work in the field - a criticism of the competitive advantage of NCM
Credit Insurance, its main UK competitor.
As part of a privatisation deal two years ago NCM was granted transitional
access to reinsurance cover in spite of the government's withdrawal from
short-term export credit insurance.
NCM's transitional support is due to run out at the end of next year. Mr
Colin Foxall, NCM's managing director, has called for the facility to be
made permanent.
The Trade Indemnity report complains that the UK is the only leading
industrial nation not providing state-backed insurance or reinsurance for
short-term credit risks, which account for 90 per cent of UK exports. As a
result UK exporters are likely to face difficulties in getting political
risk cover when the NCM transitional support ends.
The report challenges government hopes that private sector reinsurers would
emerge to fill the vacuum formed by its withdrawal from reinsurance
activity.
Even without the recession and a string of natural disasters that have
brought two bad years for reinsurers, it argues that the private sector
would lack capacity.
The report says leading reinsurers, including Swiss Re and Munich Re, are
'adamant' that no further capacity can be provided. It adds: 'Even Lloyd's
is flagging drastic reductions in available capacity. Insurance of 90 per
cent of the UK's exports now hinges on the balance sheet strength of TI and
NCM and their respective reinsurers.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday launched a
Business in Europe campaign aimed at alerting companies to export
opportunities in the single market and providing streamlined help. This will
include the secondment from the private sector of 20 executives.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Rifkind challenged over Trident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, the defence secretary, is being challenged to explain
why his ministry is considering proposals that were previously rejected as
unacceptable for refitting Trident submarines.
The Scottish Council Development and Industry said Mr Rifkind must explain
why lower standards of nuclear safety in refitting Trident may now be
acceptable.
The body, which lobbies for economic development in Scotland, also wants to
know why the matter is being decided before consulting the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate.
The government will decide in the next few weeks whether work on refitting
Trident should be carried out at Rosyth, Fife, as was decided in 1986, or at
Devonport in Plymouth.
The Babcock Thorn consortium which manages Rosyth fears that if it loses the
Trident contract the yard, which employs 4,200 people, would close within a
few years.
The contest appears to be between a proposal by Devonport to convert
existing docks into a Trident refitting facility at a cost of Pounds 130m
and a similar project at Rosyth which would cost Pounds 147m.
A total of Pounds 120m has already been spent at Rosyth on building a brand
new facility to refit Trident. But in December Babcock Thorn submitted a
proposal based instead on refurbishing battleship docks, which the company
believes is being considered by the MoD on an equal footing with Devonport's
scheme. Babcock Thorn says that when it suggested a refurbishment scheme in
1991 the plan was rejected by the Ministry of Defence in favour of the
Pounds 267m new-build project.
The development body said: 'Either the original specification had
unnecessarily high requirements, or increased risks to safety and
operational efficiency are now being accepted as cost savings.' It said the
government should explain why lower safety standards may be accepted,
especially for Devonport where many more people live in the nuclear
emergency evacuation zone than at Rosyth.
'It cannot be wise for government to depart from its original specification
for a nuclear installation without a full explanation,' the development body
added.
Babcock Thorn had earlier feared that it was not being given a fair hearing
and that Mr Rifkind had already recommended in favour of Devonport's
proposal.
A decision on the issue is not expected before next week at the earliest.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Regulator in row over gas spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JAMES McKinnon, the director general of gas supply, yesterday asked
British Gas to justify what he termed 'apparently arbitrary cuts' in capital
spending, triggering a fresh row between himself and the company, David
Lascelles writes.
Evidence of an investment cut was presented to Sir James at a meeting with
the Society of British Gas Industries. The society's members are the main
suppliers to British Gas. They claimed that British Gas had made an
arbitrary cut of 10 per cent in all its investment plans four to five months
ago.
They said the effect of this was now coming to light and together with the
British Gas policy of running down stocks, some suppliers had seen orders
fall by a third.
Sir James said that British Gas had agreed two years ago to a set of price
controls which left room for a fair rate of return and adequate investment.
He added: 'Claims by British Gas that it can no longer afford essential
investment are nonsense.'
Mr Norman Blacker, British Gas's managing director of gas business, said:
'We are disappointed that once again the regulator has gone public with
views on the company without first discussing the issue with us.' Some of
the drop in capital spending was because of the sluggishness of the housing
market, but safety was not being sacrificed. The company needed a fair rate
of return to balance the interests of its customers, shareholders and
suppliers.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Dispute looms on bank watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH Bankers' Association said yesterday that it still had severe
doubts about the wisdom of extending the banking ombudsman scheme so that
incorporated businesses can complain to the ombudsman about banking
mistakes.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to announce in the next day or
two that Mr Laurence Shurman, the ombudsman, should be allowed to adjudicate
on complaints from small businesses. At the moment only unincorporated
businesses and individuals can use the scheme.
A dispute between the banks and the chancellor is likely over which
incorporated businesses should be allowed to use the scheme. The
government's intention is to provide a complaints mechanism to small
businesses, but finding a definition of a small business acceptable to the
banks is proving difficult.
The reform to the ombudsman scheme will be part of a package of measures
aimed at forcing banks to improve their services to small businesses,
following widespread complaints that banks are treating these customers
insensitively.
The ombudsman scheme can only adjudicate on banking errors. Mr Lamont is
therefore likely to urge the banks to improve their internal procedures for
handling complaints from customers of unfair treatment by appointing
internal ombudsmen. These would be able to examine the most common form of
complaint from small-business customers, that banks have unfairly changed
the terms and conditions of a loan or other bank ser-vice.
Mr Lamont is likely to clear the banks of levying excessive interest rates
on small-business loans, although he may question whether bank charges are
being increased too much in some cases.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Clash over SIB proposals for new regulatory body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW has broken out between UK banks and the Securities and Investments
Board, regulator of the financial services industry, over SIB's recent
suggestion that it may need to acquire new powers to force individual
financial organisations to join specific self-regulatory organisations.
SIB has said that if banks continue to refuse to join a proposed new SRO for
the retail financial services industry, called the Personal Investment
Authority, it may need to ask the government for powers to 'define the scope
of SROs', or decide the membership of each SRO.
These powers would enable it to force the banks to join the PIA.
However, in a letter to SIB, the British Bankers' Association, the banks'
trade association, argues that giving such powers to SIB would mean 'the end
of the SROs in their present form'.
The letter continues: 'The SIB would ultimately find itself as the sole
authority, with the SRO boards evolv-ing into advisory boards relating to
divisions of the SIB.'
However, SIB is understood to be unimpressed by this argument that the
nature of the UK regulatory system would change radically. It feels the
banks have failed to provide any evidence for this view.
The banks are also likely to be disappointed in their interpretation of
recent remarks by Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury minister responsible for
financial services regulation.
They interpreted remarks he made last week as ruling out new primary
legislation for the reform of financial services regulation and that,
therefore, he would not be giving powers to SIB to define SROs' scope.
It is believed, however, that he is prepared to contemplate legislation if
the banks will not join the PIA of their own accord.
Earlier this month the banks' concerns about joining the PIA were eased
slightly when Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, told the PIA that its
regulatory standards must be tougher than it had originally been planning.

That could lead to secondary legislation to implement the change in time for

It would apply to large companies as defined in the 1985 Companies Act -
those with two or more of: a turnover above Pounds 11.2m, a balance sheet
total above Pounds 3.9m, and more than 250 employees.
Alternatives put forward include recording when bills are received or
invoices dated; and analysing the age of bills.

THE UK will suffer because of the sharp fall in spending on research and
development in recent years, Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry
secretary, warned yesterday.
Government figures for 1991 showed that in that year alone the UK had lost
10 per cent of its spending and of its workforce in R&amp;D, he said, even
before the worst of the recession. The government's own contribution had
fallen by 22 per cent.
Mr Cook warned that unless ministers acted to increase R&amp;D 'Britain will not
be the world's workshop but merely its assembly line'.

FT  26 JAN 93 / President of British Bankers' Association supports monetary
policy call from new bank head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR NICHOLAS Goodison, president of the British Bankers' Association,
yesterday supported the call of Mr Eddie George, the next governor of the
Bank of England, for the Bank to be given day-to-day responsibility for
monetary policy, John Gapper writes.
Sir Nicholas said he believed that the Bank would want to discard much of
its responsibility for banking supervision if it was given greater
operational freedom to decide how to attain government inflation targets.
Sir Nicholas, chairman of TSB Group, said in an interview that the
government should move towards laying explicit monetary aims before
parliament at least once a year, and then giving the Bank responsibility for
achieving them.
He said one reason the government should make its monetary targets explicit
each year was that if it wanted to change the targets for political reasons
it would be forced to disclose its intentions publicly.
He said his idea of how the Bank should operate was close to that of Mr
George, who said after his appointment was disclosed on Friday that there
was a case for giving the Bank operational responsibility for monetary
targets.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Putting the bite on consumers: A broadly based tax on energy
use could be the first step
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has a habit of leaving his options open until the
last moment. But it appears likely that in his first economic statement due
next month he will try to set a new course for US economic policy by
increasing the emphasis on consumption taxes.
These currently form a much smaller proportion of total receipts than in
other industrial countries.
At the weekend Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, signalled that a
broad-based tax on energy was being seriously considered as a first step
towards higher consumption taxes.
Mr Clinton, however, cautioned yesterday that no final decisions on how to
trim the deficit had been made.
A broad energy tax covering fuels such as coal, natural gas and nuclear
power, as well as oil, would be easier to sell politically than a higher
levy on petrol alone (which has been mooted several times) because the pain
would be spread more evenly.
Mr Bentsen said energy taxes were also attractive on environmental grounds,
because they would encourage energy conservation.
The form an energy tax would take is undecided. Vice-President Al Gore has
advocated a tax based on the carbon content of fuels. But the Clinton
administration seems more likely to consider a levy based on their heat
content, as measured, for example, by British thermal units.
The Congressional Budget Office, an independent adviser to Congress, has
estimated that a 5 per cent energy tax would raise about Dollars 18bn
(Pounds 11.8bn) a year.
Mr Bentsen said a more comprehensive shift towards consumption taxes was
likely in the longer term as a way of boosting incentives to save and
invest.
However, complexities over the collection of consumption taxes and their
potential 'regressivity' - the fact that they hit the poor harder than the
affluent - meant that the timing or extent of such a shift was uncertain.
A national sales or value added tax was not on the immediate agenda.
He did not, however, rule out other long-term options, such as the 'consumed
income' tax advocated last year by a bipartisan commission headed by
Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Pete Domenici of New Mexico.
A consumed income tax would be collected from individuals rather than
businesses and could be levied at a higher rate on the affluent. The main
difference from an ordinary income tax is that it would exclude all forms of
saving from tax.
Other elements of President Clinton's likely economic strategy are also
falling into place. He is backing away from his promise to halve the deficit
in four years on the grounds that the projected deficits are Dollars
50bn-Dollars 60bn higher than when he formulated his plan last year.
The strategy now favoured is to cut the deficit by about Dollars 145bn over
four years - the same absolute amount as promised in the campaign. This
would reduce the prospective deficit in fiscal 1997 from about Dollars 350bn
to just over Dollars 200bn.
Mr Bentsen also confirmed that plans for an income tax cut for middle-income
families have effectively been shelved. The administration, however, will
press ahead with plans to increase income taxes on the affluent - families
earning Dollars 200,000 or more a year.
Mr Bentsen refused to be drawn on the size of this tax increase but most
observers expect the top marginal rate to rise from 31 to 36 per cent.
According to Mr Daniel Patrick Moynihan, his successor as chairman of the
powerful Senate finance committee, a larger increase in top marginal rates
would be counter-productive because of its impact on economic incentives.
On the spending side, Mr Bentsen said all entitlement programmes - medical
care for the elderly and poor, and federal pensions - were being examined
for possible savings. But he made no specific commitments to curb such
programmes, which have caused the deficit to balloon in recent years.
Mr Bentsen also signalled that the administration would press ahead with
plans for a short-term fiscal stimulus. This was, he said, prudent because
the economic recovery had faltered twice in the past two years.
He refused to confirm reports that the stimulus would be only about Dollars
20bn, but said it would be much smaller than the Dollars 50bn-Dollars 60bn
mentioned last year.

THE New York Post seemed as good as dead on Sunday, but the smallest and
most sensational of the Big Apple's three leading tabloids received a
last-minute reprieve after a weekend of intrigue and frantic negotiations.
Last weekend Mr Peter Kalikow, the Post's owner, found himself facing a
crisis when Bankers Trust, his chief backer, threatened to pull the plug on
a Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.9m) credit line that had jumped to Dollars 6m in
recent weeks.
The newspaper ran a deficit last year estimated at about Dollars 5m.
Mr Kalikow thought he had resolved his problems by arranging for Mr Leon
Black, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert executive, to invest in the Post.
But advisers close to the deal say Mr Black lost interest, which led Mr
Kalikow to warn last Friday that the Post faced closure by the end of the
weekend if no one else could be found.
A 20 per cent wage cut for the newspaper's 719 employees plus a cover price
rise from 40 to 50 cents were rushed through on Sunday afternoon as a
supposed alternative solution, but proved inadequate for Bankers Trust. That
is when New York's big guns stepped into the fray.
It was Ms Cindy Adams, the Post's gossip columnist, who got most heavily
involved in the search for a buyer. She worked the telephones throughout the
weekend, ringing 'my rich friends or my smart ones who know rich ones'.
By late afternoon on Sunday Mr Kalikow was telling staff he feared the paper
would have to shut down. But behind the scenes Ms Adams and Mr Howard
Rubenstein, king of the New York public relations world, were in touch with
Mr Bill Fugazy, the limousine mogul, searching for an angel. Mr Fugazy, in
turn, contacted Mr Steve Hoffenberg, a little-known 48-year-old financier
who owns Towers Financial, a factoring and accounts receivable business.
'Everybody who was anybody was calling everybody else on Sunday to try to
save the Post,' said one investment banker whose client turned down the
deal. And that included Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York.
When Messrs Rubenstein and Fugazy could not find Mr Hoffenberg it fell to
Governor Cuomo to send out a state trooper to track down the financier. The
police could not find him, but Mr Vincent Tese, the state director of
economic development, talked to Mr Hoffenberg.
Mr Hoffenberg eventually surfaced and a series of conference calls resulted
in a last-minute agreement on Sunday night.
The deal called for Mr Hoffenberg to provide an immediate Dollars 300,000
and to guarantee the Post's Dollars 6m line of credit. In exchange he is now
in pole position to spend the next four weeks deciding whether to go ahead
and become the newspaper's new owner.
The reprieve could still fall apart, but that did not stop the tabloid from
plastering yesterday's front page with the words 'NEVER SAY DIE]'

FT  26 JAN 93 / Clinton gives Hillary key health task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday put his wife, Hillary, in charge of a
presidential task force on health care reform, widely regarded as the most
pressing social challenge facing his administration.
He said the task force would work 'night and day' to have legislative
proposals ready for Congress within 100 days of his inauguration.
The appointment makes Mrs Clinton the most powerful first lady in memory.
Mrs Rosalyn Carter, wife of former President Jimmy Carter, chaired a
presidential commission on mental health but it had nothing like the scope
of the health care task force.
The last relative of a president to exert comparable influence was Mr Robert
Kennedy, who became attorney general in his brother's administration. A
subsequent law prohibited the appointment of close relatives to cabinet
positions.
The task force will include Ms Donna Shalala, health secretary and an old
Clinton friend, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, and Mr Leon Panetta,
budget director, as well as other cabinet officers and White House staff.
Mrs Clinton will not be paid.
Mr Clinton said he had turned to his wife because 'she's better at
organising and leading people from a complex beginning to a certain end than
anybody I've ever met in my life'.
While governor of Arkansas he put her in charge of a committee that devised
educational reforms now considered one of his main achievements.
Mr Clinton said it was time to 'make sense' of the US health care system.
Tough choices had to be made if costs were to be controlled and insurance
extended to the 35m or so people without cover.
Mrs Clinton, 45, is a prominent Arkansas lawyer and a former chairwoman of
the Children's Defence Fund.
She is widely regarded as being politically to the left of her husband. Her
appointment may thus indicate that he is envisaging a radical reform of the
US health system, which relies more heavily on the private sector than other
industrial countries.
Mr Clinton vowed yesterday to lift a ban on homosexuals in the armed forces,
refusing to back down in the face of strong opposition from the military and
Congress, Reuter reports from Washington. Announcement of the policy is
expected within a week.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Legal championof civil rights: Obituary of Thurgood Marshall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE week ago non-commercial television in the US, commemorating the Martin
Luther King national holiday, aired an absorbing dramatisation of one of the
Supreme Court's landmark rulings of this century: the 1954 case known as
Brown v Board of Education which, in effect, rendered segregation illegal in
the nation's public schools.
The case had three heroes: Earl Warren, the new chief justice who broke down
the deep divisions inside the court and brought about a unanimous verdict:
Felix Frankfurter, the legendary justice who for so long agonised which way
to vote: and Thurgood Marshall, the black lawyer who argued the case for
fundamental change in the law.
Mr Marshall, who died on Sunday at the age of 84, was then director of the
legal department of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. He was the architect of its strategy of wringing from the courts the
sort of civil rights changes that the political system was still reluctant
to grant and the Brown ruling was undoubtedly his finest hour.
There were more fine hours to come. In 1961 President Kennedy made him a
federal appeals court judge. In 1965 President Johnson appointed him
solicitor general, the government's chief advocate before the Supreme Court.
Two years later he was accorded the ultimate accolade of nomination to the
Supreme Court, the first African-American ever to reach this pinnacle.
President Johnson noted that he was one of the most successful advocates
ever to appear before the court, winning 29 of 32 cases - 14 as a private
lawyer and 18 as solicitor general.
Mr Marshall served 24 years on the court, a staunch opponent of the death
penalty and limitations on abortion, and believer in affirmative action to
improve opportunity for all. He formed with now retired Justice William
Brennan a trenchant and intellectually powerful liberal wing, the quality of
whose written opinions was widely admired.
Under Presidents Reagan and Bush the court acquired a more conservative
slant and Mr Marshall became known as 'the great dissenter'. Though
increasingly ill, he postponed retirement until 1991 to ensure that the
great civil rights legislation in which he had participated was not rolled
back.
The volume of tributes to Mr Marshall, from President Clinton to Mr William
Rehnquist, the current chief justice with whom he so often disagreed, attest
to the extraordinary regard in which he was held. Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, now a pivotal swing vote on the court, called him 'a true American
hero' who had left behind 'a legacy of hope for racial equality'.
Thurgood Marshall was born in Baltimore in 1908. Denied admission to the
University of Maryland law school because of his race, he graduated top of
his class from Howard University, the predominantly black college in
Washington. He was to have administered the oath of office to Vice-President
Al Gore at last Wednesday's inaugural, but ill health prevented him from
attending.

FT  26 JAN 93 / First Guatemalan refugees return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 2,500 Guatemalan refugees, the first batch of a total of 45,000,
arrived in Guatemala City over the weekend, ending more than a decade of
exile in Mexico.
The refugees who fled army-backed atrocities in the early 1980s were
welcomed by more than 10,000 sympathisers in the capital's central square.
Mr Jorge Serrano, Guatemala's president, said their return 'marked a new era
in the direction the country will take'.
The peaceful return of the refugees is seen as a crucial test of the
government's willingness to end the country's 30-year-old civil war. But the
repatriation of the remaining refugees could still be postponed, as the
government has suspended its guarantee of their safety, after differences
with refugee leaders.
Last week Mr Serrano presented the United Nations with a plan for 'peace in
90 days' to end the civil war. The small band of left-wing rebels with whom
the government is trying to make peace agreed to discuss the proposal, but
insisted on an immediate ceasefire, and a 50 per cent reduction in the size
of the army. Mr Serrano dismissed the rebel counter-offer.
The peace plan was partly overshadowed by publicity given to the president's
visit to Stringfellows, a topless bar in New York. Mr Serrano, who is an
evangelical Christian and pastor of two Protestant churches, said he only
went to 'take a bowl of onion soup'.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UN inspectors step up search for Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEAMS of UN inspectors yesterday stepped up their search for Iraqi weapons
of mass destruction yesterday without any hindrance from local officials in
Baghdad.
Iraq's co-operation with the UN will be watched closely as evidence of its
commitment to the unilateral ceasefire it announced last week to mark the
inauguration of President Bill Clinton.
Prof Maurizio Zifferero, who heads the nuclear inspection team, said that he
hoped Iraq would provide the remaining names of foreign suppliers. 'The
Iraqis say they have already given us 90 per cent,' he said. 'They have said
they will answer questions about the other 10 per cent. We shall have to see
whether this is true or not.'
The ballistics missile team also resumed its weapons search concentrating on
Scuds of the type fired at Saudi Arabia and Israel in the Gulf war.
Iraq has adopted a conciliatory line towards the new US administration, and
newspapers in Baghdad yesterday noted that cracks had appeared in the US-led
coalition over recent air attacks.
One paper said that Iraq's initiative would encourage Mr Clinton to enter a
dialogue with Iraq, and stressed the differences between him and former
President George Bush.
Meanwhile, Iraqi air defence officers produced maps, missile fragments and
videotape to bolster their case that a Tomahawk missile had been fired
deliberately at the Rashid hotel in Baghdad on January 17.
They said that a flash of light, captured on film by a western television
crew, lit up the hotel just before the missile struck. They said the flash
was part of the missile's guidance system and proved that it was on target.
Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, said yesterday that his country
sought no confrontation with the US but was not happy with the stance of the
new US administration, Reuter reports from Baghdad.
'We do not want to be in continuous confrontation with the United States of
America,' he said in an interview with Cable News Network (CNN) television.
But he accused President Clinton's new defence secretary, Mr Les Aspin, of
'an arrogant and belligerent response' to the Iraqi initiative of offering a
unilateral ceasefire.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Uzbekistan's president tightens his grip on the oppositio:
The former Soviet republic retains the closed atmosphere of the old USSR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the political trial of Mr Abdoumanob Pulatov that resumed in the
Supreme Court today, Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov is tightening a
crackdown that has effectively silenced political debate in the former
Soviet republic.
Mr Pulatov, a leader of the opposition movement Birlik (unity), stands
accused of insulting Mr Karimov, a crime carrying a possible six-year prison
sentence.
The trial is expected to conclude today.
In another important trial last week, the Supreme Court outlawed Birlik for
three months. The crime was 'intent' to organise public demonstrations,
which are banned in Uzbekistan. The ban against Birlik, coming after months
of arrests, disappearances and beatings, leaves Uzbekistan's chief
opposition party moribund.
Last Tuesday a member of Birlik's ruling presidium, Mr Alim Karimov, who is
not related to the president, was spirited away by unidentified men and has
not been heard from since.
Another critic, Islamic Renaissance party leader Abdullah Utah, disappeared
last month.
'The living standard is so bad now that they are afraid of a social
explosion. That's why they want to eliminate all organised opposition,' said
Mr Shukhrat Ismatulayev, Birlik's co-chairman.
It is true that life has become tougher for Uzbekistan's 20m people since
the Soviet Union collapsed over a year ago. The price of some basic items
has risen 100-fold, while monthly wages have gone up only six-fold, to about
3,000 roubles (about Pounds 4.40).
But the tight grip maintained in Uzbekistan and throughout former Soviet
Central Asia probably has more to do with conservatism than with fears of a
social explosion.
More so than any of the 15 former Soviet republics, the five Central Asian
republics retain the closed, inflexible atmosphere of the former USSR.
Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan maintain different shades of
political and economic rigidity, with a new, hardline government having
recently taken power in Tajikistan.
But resource-rich Uzbekistan is the least changed from the Soviet period.
President Karimov tries to keep matters under his sole control, through a
combination of political repression and, despite public statements to the
contrary, an almost obstructionist approach to foreign investors.
Foreign businessmen grouse constantly about the problems of obtaining
decisions. Mr Karimov insists on oversight of the tiniest details, which
sometimes include even the design of luncheon invitations.
They also say that investment policy, though seeming liberal as written into
law, is still vague.
But it is Mr Karimov's political crackdown that has recently attracted the
greatest attention.
In its yearly human rights report, issued last week, the US State Department
said Uzbekistan was 'responsible for significant human rights abuses'.
'The regime's heavy-handed control of the political process. . . was a major
impediment to further progress and left in doubt its commitment to
democratisation,' the State Department said.
The report also said, 'despite government denials, the frequency of assault
on opposition political figures, with the assailants never being
apprehended, suggested government involvement'.
Mr Pulatov, Birlik's human rights committee leader, was abducted by the
Uzbekistan KGB at a human rights convention in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan last
month.
The government accuses Mr Pulatov of defaming President Karimov during a
Tashkent State University demonstration last January in which three students
were killed.
According to the government case, Mr Pulatov gave a student a placard
containing Mr Karimov's photograph and told him to carry it in the
demonstrations. Underneath the photograph was the caption: 'Here is a beast
that devours its own children.'
But in the first three days of testimony last week, the three government
witnesses - all of them students - offered contradictory accounts.
One student testified that he had no idea whose placard it was. A second
said Mr Pulatov was part of a large group of students, all of whom handled
the placard. Only the third, Mr Jalol Gadayev, testified that he saw Mr
Pulatov himself produce the placard for the student to carry.

The Danish owners of the Maersk Navigator, the fully-laden supertanker
involved in a collision at the northerly entrance to the Strait of Malacca
last Thursday, said yesterday that a fire on board was being contained and
that oil leakage from the vessel had been reduced, writes Kieran Cooke.
The supertanker, which was carrying nearly 2m barrels of crude oil, is being
kept out at sea and towed to an area about 80 miles west of the northern tip
of the Indonesian island of Sumatra and about 60 miles south of the Indian
Nicobar Islands.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Bank of Japan pressed to cut official interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the Bank of Japan for a cut in official interest rates
intensified yesterday, as the bank's regional branch managers gathered in
Tokyo to discuss the impact of the economic slowdown.
The depth of the downturn was emphasised by the release of figures showing a
3.3 per cent fall in department store sales last year, the first
year-on-year decline since the Japan Department Stores' Association began
collecting national data in 1965.
Meanwhile, the Real Estate Economic Institute said apartment sales last year
were down 11.6 per cent to 75,173, the lowest total since 1976 and about
half the figure for 1990, when property speculation peaked. The average
price of an apartment fell 12.3 per cent to Y39.38m (Pounds 202,000).
Officials of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and business organisations
called on the Bank of Japan to reduce the official discount rate (ODR) from
the present 3.25 per cent to 2.75 per cent or even 2.5 per cent to stimulate
the flagging economy and bolster a still weak stock market.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the bank's governor, admitted that economic conditions are
'severe' but said that a promised increase in public works spending should
assist in reviving demand.
However, it is understood that many regional branch managers in Tokyo for
the two-day meeting are advising that an ODR rate cut should come quickly.
The central bank has been surprised by the erosion of consumer confidence in
recent months, a trend highlighted by the department stores' sales
statistics. Clothing sales fell 3 per cent last year, household supplies
were down 7 per cent and foodstuff sales rose a slim 0.1 per cent.
Department store sales fell 8.1 per cent in December, compared with the same
month a year earlier, suggesting that consumer confidence is weakening,
partly due to a cut in year-end bonuses and a decrease in overtime payments.
Clothing sales were down 9.2 per cent and sales of personal items fell 6 per
cent.
The ODR was last cut in July last year, and Bank of Japan officials are
concerned that the expectation of another cut is prompting consumers to
delay spending in areas such as housing and cars.
Japanese business leaders also want a quick announcement, as the fiscal year
ends in March, and many companies, financial and non-financial, will be
forced to announce large appraisal losses on stock portfolios unless the
market rises sharply in coming weeks.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Malaysia's disaster warnings go unheeded in Strait of
Malacca: Maersk Navigator collision was the latest in a series of accidents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY 24 hours as many as 600 vessels, some small fishing craft, some
300,000-tonne tankers, pass through the 600-mile-long Strait of Malacca. It
is one of the world's busiest shipping channels, a vital conduit of world
trade.
Malaysia has been at the forefront of efforts to have the strait better
policed. It has warned that sooner or later an environmental disaster will
occur. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has talked of 'a
state of near lawlessness' in the area.
Last week's collision involving the Maersk Navigator supertanker was only
the latest in a series of accidents in the strait in recent months. Last
September a collision between a tanker and a container ship resulted in
13,000 tonnes of crude oil being spilled, much of it on the beaches of
Malaysia. In August 10 passengers were drowned after a collision between a
cruise liner and a fishing trawler off the Malaysian coast.
Attempts to improve controls in the waterway are hampered both by
differences between the three adjacent states - Malaysia, Singapore and
Indonesia - and by international law.
Singapore, while it has rigid anti-pollution regulations of its own, does
not want to take action that might deter shipping from the region and
jeopardise its position as one of the world's main shipping hubs. Singapore
is now the world's largest container port.
Indonesia has scant resources to spend on any proper policing measures which
would cover its waters - stretching across an area wider than the US.
Malaysia says the littoral states of the Strait of Malacca should not have
to pay for pollution caused by others. Mr Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, foreign
minister, addressing the United Nations General Assembly last year, said
international maritime law and regulations had to be revised to take account
of modern conditions and to ensure that all those using the Malacca Strait
shared responsibility for pollution and safety problems.
'When such accidents occur, we have to do the cleaning up - which is a
financial burden - as well as endure the sudden harm and destruction to our
marine resources . . . this is too much for the poor littoral states to bear
alone.'
Malaysia has suggested that ships passing through the strait pay a levy for
each journey. There have also been calls for a proper traffic separation
scheme, with designated shipping lanes.
Shipowners are likely to resist any move which would impose greater costs on
their operations. The Strait of Malacca is an international waterway and a
levy system or traffic control scheme cannot simply be imposed by the
surrounding countries.
The other very prickly problem in the area is piracy. While recorded acts of
piracy in south-east Asian waters decreased last year, attacks still occur.
In one recent attack pirates boarded a container ship, killing the British
captain and his first mate.
In another incident some time ago pirates boarded a supertanker, tied up its
crew and left it cruising, unpiloted.
While there have been efforts by Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia to try to
fight the piracy problem, these have been hampered by regional sensitivities
and questions of sovereignty.
Most pirates are believed to operate from bases in Indonesia but both
Singapore and Malaysia are reluctant to lay the entire blame on their
powerful neighbour.
Malaysia has called an international conference next month to discuss some
of these problems. 'If things go on as they are there is going to be a
disaster,' said one Singapore-based shipping expert. 'If it's not happening
right now, it's just a question of time.'

CHINA will open up more construction projects to foreign participation as
part of its overall drive to build up the infrastructure of the country,
according to the official Xinhua news agency, Reuter reports from Beijing.
Foreign businessmen, the news agency said, would be allowed to invest solely
or jointly with Chinese partners in the construction of motorways, bridges
and tunnels and to invest solely in the construction of private docks and
waterways for cargo shipping.
Sino-foreign co-operation is now encouraged in managing berths on public
docks and also in loading, unloading, storage, packaging and leasing docks
and land for development.
China's inefficient transport system, according to officials and economists,
is a serious drag on economic development.

<TEXT>
ISRAELI Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday dismissed suggestions that
the government would privately welcome a High Court decision to overturn the
mass expulsion of Palestinians to Lebanon.
The court, which is expected to rule this week on the legality of the
action, has become the focus of the crisis over the December expulsions,
which were unanimously condemned as illegal by the United Nations Security
Council and have thrown the future of Middle East peace talks into doubt.
Opponents of the move, both inside and outside Israel, have suggested that a
court ruling against the expulsions would provide the way out of the crisis
for the government and for the new US administration, which is anxious to
avoid disruption of the peace negotiations. Israel has sought to defer any
further action against it by the UN until after the court's decision is
given.
But Mr Rabin said he did not want to be overruled. 'I am full of hope that
the High Court will indeed approve this. I regret the voices that pretend
there is supposedly a need for someone to rescue the government. The
government does not need to be rescued, it needs to stick to its positions,'
he said.
The High Court's seven judges would no doubt be widely applauded in the
international community if they did rule against the government. Such a
ruling would lift the pressure for UN sanctions to enforce Security Council
resolution 799 demanding the return of the deportees and meet Palestinian
conditions for resuming peace talks.
But it would also be a deeply damaging blow to Mr Rabin's political prestige
at home, ironically undermining his ability to make concessions in the peace
negotiations. It would also be regarded in Israel as an unprecedented rebuff
to the powerful military establishment which justified the expulsions on
security grounds.
Civil rights lawyers arguing the case against the deportations, the largest
number ever carried out at one time, say a dangerous precedent has been set
of using expulsion as a collective punishment.
But there is little confidence among Palestinians that the court will
reverse the expulsions. It has only ever overturned one of hundreds carried
out over the years, assenting to the state's contention that the Fourth
Geneva Convention ban on such expulsions does not apply in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
The court has previously insisted on the right of appeal prior to
deportation. But the government argues that the right to prior appeal does
not apply in the present case because the expulsions were not permanent,
that they were only a 'temporary removal' for up to two years.
Yesterday, in an effort to ensure the court's approval, the government said
it would set up elaborate means for the 396 alleged Islamic militants still
stranded in Lebanon to appeal against their banishment individually from
their isolated campsite.
The attorney general promised that telephone points and mail deliveries
would be provided.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Major hails investment fruits of his Indian trip

<TEXT>
BRITISH Prime Minister John Major, seeking to promote British business
during a visit to India, yesterday hailed planned investments by British Gas
and British Aerospace and a proposed bilateral business discussion group as
the first fruits of his trip.
After a meeting with Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, Mr
Major said both countries would benefit from greater economic co-operation.
British investment in India would help India's economic reform, while export
growth would lead Britain's economic recovery.
The prime minister was speaking on the eve of celebrations today to mark
India's Republic Day, at which he is the chief guest. Security cover for the
event was tightened yesterday following the arrest of four Sikh militants
who were allegedly planning to plant a bomb in New Delhi.
Mr Major said he was 'entirely content' with security arrangements. But he
acknowledged that the threat of an incident may have been increased by the
recent signing of an extradition treaty between the UK and India, which
would ease the extradition of suspected Indian terrorists from Britain.
However, Delhi police said the level of security cover was normal for a
Republic Day celebration as was the level of risk of an attack from
terrorists. Mr RS Sahay, the additional deputy commissioner of police, who
is in charge of security, said: 'Terrorist groups would want to attack at a
time like this (Republic Day). John Major is no particular target.' Mr
Major's security cover was 'the same as for any other head of state,' Mr
Sahay said.
The prime minister, who is accompanied by a delegation of senior British
businessmen, is anxious to link the visit to commercial successes for UK
companies. The two deals he cited yesterday are relatively modest. British
Gas is planning to take a 35 per cent stake in a joint venture to supply
natural gas to Bombay, India's biggest city. British Gas and its partners
will invest Pounds 100m, spread over 10 years.
British Aerospace, the aerospace and engineering group, will take a 40 per
cent stake in a software company to be set up with Hindustan Aeronautics,
the Indian aerospace company. The total equity investment is Rs60m (Pounds
1.35m).
The bilateral business discussion group was announced by Mr Major after his
talks with Mr Rao. It is to consist of British and Indian businessmen and
will be chaired by Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas. The group is to
consider measures to promote two-way trade and investment and to report back
to the two prime ministers at the end of the year.
Mr Howard Davies, director general of the CBI, welcomed Mr Major's help for
exports. 'We have been asking for more government help for exports for some
time. Now we are getting it.
'The business community is very chipper. For many of them this (trip) has
been a nice little earner.'
Mr Major said in a speech last night that India's far-reaching economic
reforms would continue to open up significant new opportunities for business
and investment. At a banquet given by Mr Rao, Mr Major praised India's
efforts to liberalise its economy.
He referred obliquely to the violence and political turmoil which has hit
India since the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque, saying that Britain
supported 'the work of safeguarding the fabric of Indian life so
successfully created over many years'.

FT  26 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Canadians try to end dumping disputes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN steel producers want a bilateral trade agreement with the US aimed
at promoting an integrated North American steel market in which both sides
would place less emphasis on anti-dumping duties and other import curbs.
The initiative has surfaced on the eve of a widely-awaited dumping ruling
expected tonight from the US commerce department against imports of
flat-rolled steel products from 21 countries, including Canada as well as
Japan, South Korea and a number of European countries.
Foreign producers deemed to be dumping will have to pay bonds ranging up to
25 per cent on all shipments while the extent of injury to the US industry
is examined. The International Trade Commission will make its final injury
determination by May 27.
The Canadian proposal is based on an argument that the relationship between
the US and Canadian steel industries is unique, both in the extent of
cross-border trade and in the way the trade is conducted.
As a first step, the Canadians suggest that both Ottawa and Washington
should drop current anti-dumping investigations. According to a Canadian
government document, 'these investigations make no commercial sense'.
Later this week Revenue Canada will make preliminary determinations of
dumping against imports of hot-rolled steel from six countries, including
the US. The complaint affects about CDollars 200m (Pounds 102m) of US
exports out of a total of CDollars 800m.
The US industry's complaint against Canada affects about a quarter of annual
exports to the US, totalling CDollars 1.5bn.
The Canadian producers acknowledge that they are 'technically' guilty of
dumping steel in the US, but they dispute some of the criteria used by
Washington.
The Canadian proposals include the appointment of a high-level panel of
steel-industry executives. The panel would examine reforms in the trade laws
of both countries to recognise the integration of the North American steel
market.

FT  26 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Asean free trade zone sputters into action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE, WILLIAM KEELING, JOSE GALANG and VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH less fanfare than Europe or North America, the six members of the
Association of South East Asian Nations this year began to build their own
free trade zone.
It was easy to see why the first steps towards the Asean free trade area, or
Afta, were not exactly trumpeted abroad.
Asean countries - Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines
and Brunei - regard Afta and its 320m inhabitants as a future counterweight
to other international trade blocs and as a way to expose their domestic
industries to healthy regional competition. But the reality is that they do
most of their trade with Europe, Japan and the US and not with each other.
If entrepot trade with Singapore is excluded, Asean countries conduct only
about 5 per cent of their trade with their Asean partners.
And although the Afta ideal is progressively to reduce mutual tariffs on all
goods except agricultural products to between 0 and 5 per cent within 15
years, the agreement is undermined by clauses allowing each country to
exclude any industries that it wants to continue to protect.
The Asean members have announced lists of hundreds of products which they
are exempting from the normal track of tariff reductions and from the fast
track (for 15 categories of goods for which tariffs are due to fall to
between 0 and 5 per cent within seven to 10 years).
As expected the Philippines and Indonesia have announced the most
exclusions, and Singapore, which is virtually a free port already, the
least.
The loose nature of the Afta agreement and the low level of intra-Asean
trade mean that there is little sense of urgency about putting it into
practice. An Indonesian minister, for example, said recently that it would
take all of Afta's 15-year implementation period before there was a
significant impact on the Indonesian economy.
Indonesia has yet to release detailed lists of products to be included or
excluded from the scheduled tariff reductions and economists are sceptical
about how open it intends to be. When the government announced 250 tariff
cuts last July it turned out that 90 per cent of them related to different
types of batik cloth, an Indonesian specialty.
Meanwhile, Malaysian-made Proton cars are likely to continue to be targeted
at Britain, with no signs that they will be allowed to flood to the
highly-protected Indonesian vehicle market.
In what may be a signal of troubles to come, Mrs Rafidah Aziz, the Malaysian
trade minister, says her government is pressing Indonesia, the Philippines
and Thailand to start tariff cuts under Afta's Common Effective Preferential
Tariff (CEPT) scheme as soon as possible.
Mrs Rafidah has warned other Asean members not to take advantage of what she
calls 'Malaysia's generosity'. She says: 'We will not allow our domestic
industries to be out-competed.'
Malaysia is not alone in fearing competition. The Philippines, for example,
is excluding coconut oil because nearly a third of the Philippine population
depends on coconut products for a living.
Thailand's petrochemical producers have pleaded with the Thai government for
state financing, for cuts in the price of the gas they use as a raw
material, and even for petrochemical import quotas - precisely the kind of
non-tariff barriers that the Afta agreement rejects.
The loud complaints of protected industries about the dangers of Afta are an
indication that the agreement is not entirely ineffective.
It is also true that government desire to expose some of their domestic
industries to limited competition is helping Afta's implementation. In late
December, for instance, the Philippine government said it had persuaded its
textile manufacturers to include another 400 products in the
tariff-reduction programme.
However, the lack of legally-binding obligations to cut tariffs may yet be
the undoing of Afta. Professor Richard Lipsey, a Canadian economist, noted
recently that the Asean tariff reduction scheme seemed piecemeal compared
with the 'one big package' agreed between the US and Canada.
The problem for the Asean countries is that they agreed on Afta in
principle, and today are still negotiating the details.
Another obstacle to harmony within Afta is the lack of any provision for the
free movement of labour.
Dr Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, the former Indonesian foreign minister, has raised
this objection at a meeting in Kuala Lumpur last year to celebrate Asean's
first 25 years.
'Singapore and Malaysia are always telling us to lower tariffs and duties
and let their goods into the country,' he said. 'But in return, how about
the free movement of labour? We will take your goods if you will take our
surplus labour supply. When they hear this and think about all those
Indonesians coming to work in their countries, then they say, 'wait a
minute, maybe it's not such a good idea'.'
With per capita income in Singapore 20 times as high as in Indonesia, the
economic disparities within Asean make those within the EC pale into
insignificance.
Even if Afta is fully implemented by the year 2008, it could take a few more
years before Asean becomes truly a single market.

FT  26 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Top spirit brands see sales decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLUME sales of the top 100 international spirits brands declined for the
second successive year in 1992 as markets worldwide were hit by the bleak
economic climate. Total shipments fell 1.2 per cent from 273.5m cases to
270.2m, according to Impact International, the drinks industry monitor.
Reduced consumer spending was particularly marked in the US, UK and Japan.
'While still a lucrative market, Japan is no longer the easy-growth,
high-profit market it was in the late 1980s,' says Impact.
Scotch whisky sales in Japan last year were between 5 per cent and 10 per
cent below the 1991 level. Cognac volumes were 15 per cent down, and bourbon
consumption declined 10 per cent.
However, markets elsewhere, in south-east Asia, and in southern European
countries such as Spain, Greece and Portugal, remained buoyant with
consumers still moving from local spirits brands to imports.
'Latin America is also emerging as the key potential growth area for the
1990s,' the report says.
Grand Metropolitan, Guinness, and Allied-Lyons, the UK-based groups which
own 31 of the leading 100 brands, saw total volumes down 2.1m cases.
Of the top 10 companies, owning 62 brands, only three - Pedro Domecq,
Brown-Forman, and American Brands - increased volume sales.
The top three brands maintained their rankings in spite of significant
volume losses. Difficult trading conditions in the US contributed to a 1.9
per cent decrease in sales of Bacardi rum, the world's best-selling spirit.
Volumes dropped from 21.6m to 21.2m cases. GrandMet's Smirnoff vodka, in
second place, recorded a 4.1 per cent decline to 14.2m cases.
Sales of Ricard, the French anis brand, were 1.3 per cent down at 7.4m cases
in third spot.
The three leading Scotch whisky brands increased sales. Guinness's Johnnie
Walker Red was 1.5 per cent ahead at 6.6m cases. GrandMet's J&amp;B Rare,
continuing to gain ground on its rival, grew 3.3 per cent to 6.2m cases.
Allied's Ballantine's recorded a 1.9 per cent increase to 5.3m cases.
Bourbon sales recovered strongly from a setback in 1991. American Brands'
Jim Beam grew 8 per cent to 5.2m cases; Brown-Forman's Jack Daniels achieved
a 4.8 per cent increase to 4.4m cases; and the group's Early Times brand was
3.6 per cent up at 1.5m cases.
Leading cognacs suffered badly from the worldwide recession. Only Remy
Martin gained volume, up 3.9 per cent to 1.7m cases. Hennessy, the category
leader, declined 2.6 per cent to 2.5m cases. Other cheaper brandies recorded
generally good performances.
Among white spirits, Jose Cuervo tequila achieved a 2.9 per cent increase in
sales to 4.3m cases. Six brands of gin recorded a combined decline of 1.1
per cent. Guinness's market leader, Gordon's, fell 1.6 per cent to 6.1m
cases but Seagram's gin bucked the trend with a 2.3 per cent rise to 4.4m
cases.

WITH A key deadline for the conclusion of the Uruguay Round fast
approaching, the new top trade officials of the US and EC have set February
11 as the date for their first meeting.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC external economic affairs commissioner, had hoped to
meet Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, this week. He is keen to
maintain whatever momentum has been achieved before a March 2 deadline by
which President Bill Clinton would have to inform the Congress a deal has
been done to get congressional approval without amendment.
Sir Leon's spokesman yesterday said the meeting had been delayed to allow Mr
Kantor to assemble his new team.
In the US, Sir Leon's haste is seen as a pressure tactic designed either to
push a new official before he gets his 'sea legs', or as an attempt to shift
the blame for the Round's failure to the US. Sir Leon is accused of
'overstating the areas of agreement'.
Miss Barbara North, director of the coalition formed by business groups to
lobby for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said Mr Kantor had had
'absolutely no time' to put his staff together and study his options.

CUBA, one of the last bastions of hard-line communism, has opened its doors
to capitalist retailing with a joint venture with Italy's Benetton clothing
group.
Benetton, with a network of 7,047 stores, plans eight shops in Cuba this
year. The network may be extended depending on their success.
The retailing venture is confined to popular tourist locations and sales
will be in hard currencies only. It represents the first fruits of a 1991
Cuban law allowing equal participation joint ventures between state
companies and outside partners.
Although there has already been some foreign investment in Cuba, notably by
Spanish groups in the hotels sector, the new venture is the first of its
kind in retailing.
The Benetton stores will be run by a newly-formed company set up between
Cubanacan, the main government-owned tourism and commercial concern, and
Connoly, a Bahamas-based company owned by Mr Enrico Garzaroli, an Italian
businessman.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Battle of the sexes moves on to pensions front: Employers
are anxiously watching today's proceedings at the European Court of Justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEN and women may have been created equal, but their pensions have not, as
the European Court of Justice is about to hear. Today, three cases, one each
from Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, come before it, and the decision
will spell out for employers all over Europe exactly how they are to
equalise men's and women's pensions.
The court took a landmark decision in May 1990, broadly saying men and women
must receive equal pensions because these are a form of pay, and sex may not
be used to determine pay. But many issues remain outstanding. Since the
second world war most European employers have set a lower retirement age for
women, effectively giving them more generous pensions than their male
counterparts. An entire framework of state, occupational and personal
pensions has grown up around that concept, which lasted until the court
ruled it violated the anti-discrimination statutes of the Treaty of Rome.
The British case, to be presented by Sir Nicholas Lyell, UK
attorney-general, pits the male and female pension scheme members of
Coloroll, the collapsed home furnishings group, against each other, with
each arguing for different interpretations of equality, to get the maximum
share of the fixed funds available. The German case, Meroni v Collor, asks
to decide the issue of retrospection (how far back in time higher pension
payments to men will have to be made), while the Dutch case, known as
TenOever, asks if it is fair to offer pensions to members' widows but not
their widowers.
The cases address two basic issues: first, since the court only decided
differential pensions are illegal in May 1990, what about pension benefits
accrued or paid before then? The EC commissioned a survey which concluded
that if pensions in payment had to be equalised retrospectively, it could
cost British and German employers up to Pounds 50bn each, with somewhat more
modest sums for employers in Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands.
That sobering assessment led EC member states to tack a protocol on the
Maastricht treaty declaring retrospectivity in occupational pension payments
should only apply to service after May 1990, the date of the court judgment.
With the fate of the Maastricht treaty in the air, European employers are
anxiously watching the court proceedings.
Lawyers familiar with the proceedings say the European Commission has filed
a brief in support of the narrowest definition of retrospection. This will
weigh considerably with the court, but is not definitive, thus reducing the
chances employers will be saddled with a hefty bill for retrospective
pension payments.
The court must also decide on an issue which will have great significance
for the nascent personal pensions industry throughout Europe. If men and
women must receive equal pension benefits, what happens in so-called money
purchase schemes which take into account the average longer life spans of
women?
In these, employers provide a lump sum on retirement to buy an annuity from
a life insurer. But a woman investing the same sum as a man at the same age
will receive lower monthly payments since she is expected to live longer. To
provide equal monthly payments, employers would have to give larger lump
sums to women, or insurers would have to adopt unisex rates.
Mr John Cunliffe, partner at solicitors McKenna and Co, one of the firms
presenting the British case to the court said: 'In money purchase schemes,
do you take into account that women live longer than men? That's it in a
nutshell.'
Mr Cunliffe cites Denmark where employers are allowed either to pay higher
premiums for women so they can buy the same level of benefit as men on
retirement or insurance companies are allowed to pay lower benefits for the
same premium. In the US, the Supreme Court has ruled differential insurance
benefits based on sex are illegal. 'They ruled that while on average women
live longer than men, it cannot be proven any one woman will live longer
than any man. Thus, you have to offer the same benefits for the same
premium.'

EC TRANSPORT and environ -ment ministers were last night examining the
possibility of excluding oil tankers from waters near environmentally
sensitive areas, following tanker disasters off the Shetland Islands and
north-west Spain, writes David Gardner in Brussels.
No decisions were expected from yesterday's unscheduled meeting, which was
called, EC diplomats acknowledged, to demonstrate politically that the
Community intends to act.
Transport ministers are to examine a forthcoming report on maritime safety
by the European Commission at their meeting in March, and expect to agree on
priority measures in June, according to Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport
secretary. One possibility is for the EC to draw up a mandatory new routing
system for vessels, to keep them away from vulnerable marine life areas.
Shell International Petroleum said yesterday that about 20 per cent of the
world's tankers were substandard and should be forced out of business, AP
reports from London. The ensuing rise in freight rates would allow
shipowners to replace ageing vessels with newer ones.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Niels Helveg Petersen, who took over as foreign minister in Denmark's
four-party coalition government yesterday, said his top priority would be to
secure a Yes vote for the Maastricht treaty on European union in the second
Danish referendum, to be held later this year.
'I regard it as my foremost task to achieve a Yes in the referendum and to
ensure that the Danish presidency of the European Council is carried out
satisfactorily,' he said yesterday.
'We shall make every effort to see that the presidency, which has been well
prepared, goes well.'
Mr Petersen, 54, is the most senior cabinet appointee from the Radical
Liberals, one of the small centre parties in the new government coalition.
He will play a key role in the European Community in coming months during
the six-month EC presidency which Denmark assumed at the beginning of the
year.
He succeeds former foreign minister and Euro-enthusiast, Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen. The new cabinet was announced yesterday by Mr Poul Nyrup
Rasmussen, the new prime minister and chairman of the Social Democratic
party (SDP).
Mr Petersen said the new government had not set a date for the referendum
but he thought a date 'before June' was probable.
Mr Petersen's Radical Liberal party has a record of being sceptical towards
European integration, but the foreign minister said that he had advocated a
Yes to the Maastricht treaty in last year's referendum. He said he did not
think his European credentials could be doubted.
The new cabinet is the largest in Denmark's history with 24 members. Several
ministries have been split up to create enough portfolios to meet the
requirements of the coalition of the SDP, the Radicals, the Centre Democrats
and the Christian People's party. SDP politicians given key posts included
Mr Mogens Lykketoft, minister of finance, and Mr Hans Haekkerup, minister of
defence. Mr Jann Sjursen, Christian party, becomes the youngest cabinet
minister, at 29, taking the energy ministry.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S warning yesterday that it may seek sanctions against Croatia fits
in with its long-standing advocacy of an even-handed approach towards
warring parties in the former Yugoslavia.
Moscow argues that any party, and not just the Serbs, should be punished for
violations of international agree-ments.
But both western diplomats and Russian conservatives say that Russia's
fundamental alignment with the west on Yugoslavia is unlikely to change as
long as pro-western reformers remain in power. Western diplomats add,
however, that Russia would find it difficult to support tough new action
against Serbs in Bosnia if it appeared that the west was prepared to
overlook violations by other ethnic groups.
The eruption of fresh fighting in Croatia's UN-monitored enclave of Krajina
prompted the statement yesterday by Mr Vitaly Churkin, deputy foreign
minister, that Moscow might propose international sanctions against Croatia
if its forces continued to attack Serbs.
The Foreign Ministry said later: 'Such action, undertaken at a time when a
settlement of the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina has become a real
possibility, is an extremely ill-thought out move. It has become another
link in the chain of violations of UN Security Council requirements.' It
added that the Croatians had long ignored the no-fly zone over Bosnia,
supplied weapons to Croat forces and led military actions against Moslems
there.
'Such actions are unacceptable and must receive an adequate reaction from
the international community.'
The tentative nature of Mr Churkin's warning - the government has no
immediate plans to propose sanctions - appears to be part of the Foreign
Ministry's balancing act between conservatives and reformers at home.
Reassurance on this point came from an unusual quarter yesterday.
Mr Vladimir Isakov, leader of parliament's hardline Rossiya faction who has
just returned from talks with Serbian leaders in Belgrade, said that
although he supported Mr Churkin's suggestion as 'an option for balancing
out the situation', it was unlikely to be implemented.
Serb nationalists have fostered close links with Russian hardliners opposed
to President Boris Yeltsin. The co-operation ranges from sanctions
violations to Cossack volunteers fighting on the Serb side in Bosnia. The
media had appealed to the Russian government to take its little brother
Serbia under its protection.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Frankfurt's future as a financial centre boosted: Kohler
package will fill the regulatory gaps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Horst Kohler, state secretary in the German ministry of finance,
yesterday delivered what his government promised almost exactly a year ago:
a package of concrete proposals to improve the standing of 'Finanzplatz
Germany', Germany as a financial centre.
'This is a breakthrough for Finanzplatz Germany's international competitive
position,' said Mr Kohler, 'and it should secure jobs and income in this
fast-growing sector'.
He acknowledged that the current regulatory environment in Germany is not up
to international standards, to the detriment of the country's entire
financial service sector.
He spelt out the details of a new law which will introduce a centralised
regulatory body for Germany's securities markets and make insider dealing a
criminal offence for the first time. The draft law - likely to be on the
statute books early next year - comes after 12 months of 'behind the scenes'
negotiations between Bonn and the Lander which are currently responsible for
policing financial markets on their turf. Bonn's broad aims were spelt out
in a 'concept' paper written by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, last
January. At the core of the proposals is the new supervisory body, to be
called the Bundesamt fur das Wertpapierwesen.
This will be a federal body, independent of existing banking regulators,
which will employ at least 100 people. It is not yet decided where it will
be based: market participants want it based in Frankfurt, Germany's
financial capital, but it may end up in the eastern part of Germany for
political reasons.
The new body will be the German equivalent to the Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission, the powerful regulator of the US securities markets. It will
represent Germany on the international stage in dialogue with other
regulators.
Within Germany, working together with the Lander and the country's eight
stock exchanges, it will police the following three areas:
The new anti-insider dealing law. Mr Kohler did not disclose a definition of
this offence, but warned that penalties would be tough, ranging from fines
to imprisonment.
A set of new rules designed to encourage disclosure and transparency on the
German equity markets. At present, German companies are only obliged to
disclose stakes in other companies when they reach 25 per cent, in contrast
to a 3 per cent threshhold in the UK. The disclosure threshhold will be
lowered to 10 or possibly 5 per cent. This rule could have an important
impact on German companies: secret stake-building is at present widespread.
A set of 'rules of conduct' for participants in the securities markets. This
will spell out in precise terms professionals' obligations to their clients.
Professionals will be obliged to separate their own investments from those
of their clients.
The package of measures comes just after the founding of the Deutsche Borse
AG, a common holding structure for Germany's fragmented stock-exchanges
which came into being at the beginning of the year. Both moves show
Germany's determination to intensify its challenge to London and other
European financial centres, a determination shared by legislators as well as
market participants. Once the new measures are implemented, they are are
likely to enhance Frankfurt's standing in the eyes of international
investors and lead to profound changes in the conduct of securities business
at home.

<TEXT>
GERMANY, which spearheaded and precipitated the European Community's
recognition of Croatia in 1991, has sharply criticised Zagreb's incursion
into Krajina in the south of the republic at the weekend.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, told Mr Zdenko Skrabalo, his Croatian
counterpart, that he understood Croatia's frustration at not being able to
gain full control over its territory, but he condemned the use of force,
saying it would weaken support by Germany and the international community
for the Zagreb government.
'Croatia's actions at the weekend also play into the hands of Slobodan
Milosevic (the president of Serbia),' said a foreign ministry official.
'Milosevic will point out how he, unlike Croatia, is the man of peace,' he
added.
Germany is the largest provider of aid to Croatia, and is likely to argue
strongly against any attempt to impose any economic sanctions against the
country.
The Foreign Ministry yesterday defended the decision by Mr Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, the former foreign minister, to speed up the recognition of
Croatia in December 1991, despite opposition from France and Britain.
'It was morally right and just in the face of aggression by the Yugoslav
army, and Serbia,' an official said.
Bonn points out that Mr Milosevic's acceptance of the Vance plan for Croatia
is far removed from the actual implementation of it. The plan, agreed by
Zagreb and Belgrade in December 1991, paved the way for ending the war in
Croatia by setting up four United Nations protectorate zones on about a
third of Croatian territory held by Serb nationalists. It also included a
process of demilitarisation by Serb forces in those zones, as well as the
eventual return of Croatian and other refugees to those Croatian regions.
Since October, the UN has postponed the return of the refugees on the
grounds that it was unsafe. The decision by Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman to use military force in the protected zones reflects his
frustration with delays by the UN, fears that the UN was cementing Serbian
gains in the republic, and his determination to regain control, by force if
necessary, of all Croatian territory. 'Since the Serbs were not willing to
demilitarise the 'pink zones' so as to allow Croatian refugees to return,
should we not learn some lessons from that?' an official said.
Officials in Bonn said that they repeatedly pleaded with Mr Tudjman for
patience and adherence to the Vance/UN plan, whose mandate expires in May.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of west German industry agreed yesterday to step up private
investment in east Germany from DM110bn (Pounds 45.2bn) last year to DM130bn
in 1993, provided the trade unions agree to hold back the pace of wage
equalisation between east and west.
The plans include specific commitments from German banks and the insurance
industry to pump in an extra DM1bn apiece for housing and industrial loans.
The business leaders also called for sweeping changes in the system of
subsidising eastern enterprises, to be tied more closely to their
competitiveness and market performance. They also want a strict time limit
on the subsidy programme.
The plans were put forward at a top-level meeting with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, as the latest round of talks to renegotiate the rapid rise in east
German engineering workers' wages ended in deadlock.
The employers want to postpone a 26 per cent pay rise due on April 1,
arguing it will be the last straw for both privatised and unprivatised
enterprises. The negotiations on behalf of 130,000 mechanical and electrical
engineers in Saxony, the most important industrial state in the east, now go
to legal arbitration.
At the same time, the leaders of Germany's opposition Social Democratic
Party (SPD) rejected, 'for the time being', an approach by Mr Kohl to attend
a new round of talks on his planned 'solidarity pact' for east Germany.
Mr Bjorn Engholm, the party leader, rejected a package of government savings
measures as 'sinister and anti-social'.
The business leaders from Germany's four main employers' organisations
yesterday presented a grim picture of the industrial collapse of the former
east Germany.
At their latest round of talks with Chancellor Kohl on the solidarity pact,
supposed to be completed by next week, they admitted the 'necessary
shrinking' of east German industry had now become outright
de-industrialisation, with potentially devastating consequences for the rest
of the economy.
In a nine-point paper submitted to the chancellor, they estimated that total
new investment of DM400bn-DM500bn was needed to create 2m new jobs in east
Germany. Since 1989, the number employed in east German manufacturing
industry has collapsed from more than 3m to an estimated 700,000 at the end
of last year.
The employers said the private sector planned to step up investment in east
Germany this year from DM110bn to DM130bn, and would maintain those plans in
spite of the gathering recession in the west.
They also proposed programmes to boost the purchasing of eastern products by
western enterprises, extra efforts to boost the marketing of eastern
products inside and outside Germany, and special programmes to support
research and development.
The future of the solidarity pact hangs in the balance over coming days,
with mixed signals from trade unions and the 16 state governments.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of IG-Metall, the engineering workers' union,
maintains much has been achieved in the talks, but insists the eastern wage
contracts of his members are not open for renegotiation - the key demand put
forward by the employers.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Serbs and Croats fan the flames
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE renewed outbreak of fighting between Croats and Serbs in Croatia's
Serb-occupied enclave of Krajina has once again underlined the difficulty of
dealing with the various elements of the Yugoslav crisis in isolation of
each other.
Just as progress was beginning to be made on a negotiated solution to the
bloody conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina, the attention of the negotiators at
the Geneva peace conference was diverted by an explosion in a region of
Croatia which had remained relatively calm since the end of Serb-Croat
hostilities a year ago. 'We were so busy putting out the fire in the
living-room that we did not notice it had spread to the attic,' in the words
of a diplomat close to the Geneva conference.
Yet it was in Croatia that the conflagration had broken out in the first
place, and where the embers have continued to glow even after the main blaze
was extinguished. The agreement of January 1992, which ended the Serb-Croat
civil war and opened the door to the presence of the United Nations
Protection Force in the region, was no more than a glorified ceasefire
accord. Even its author, Mr Cyrus Vance, who is one of the co-chairman of
the current Bosnian peace negotiations, would not claim that it offered a
durable political solution.
By allowing parts of Croatia conquered by the Serbs to remain under
effective Serbian control, albeit with an inadequate UN force to keep the
two sides apart, supervise heavy weapons and 'guarantee' the peace, the
signatories were merely storing up trouble for themselves and sowing the
seeds of future conflict. It was essentially Croat frustration with the
constant procrastination of the Serbs in handing back, as they had
undertaken, the Maslenica bridge and Zemunik airport - vital communication
links between northern Croatia and the Dalmatian coast - that sparked the
Croat offensive in Krajina.
That could have been foreseen, and there is every indication that President
Franjo Tudjman of Croatia gave advance warning to the international
mediators in Geneva, and by implication to the Serb leadership, of what he
intended to do if the Serbs did not meet their obligations. It was not for
nothing that Lord Owen, who is habitually strictly impartial in his public
utterances, on this occasion expressed understanding for the frustration of
the Croats, without however excusing their recourse to force. What the whole
affair has shown is that the right priorities are not necessarily being
respected in the efforts to achieve a peace settlement for the former
Yugoslavia.
It is understandable that the most burning problem of the moment, which is
Bosnia with all its attendant horrors of ethnic cleansing and brutality,
should be the focus of peace negotiations. Yet there can be no guarantee
whatsoever that even a solution of this complicated problem, unlikely as
that seems at the moment, would necessarily lead to an overall Yugoslav
peace settlement.
While the negotiators are busy with constitutional principles, maps and
provincial boundaries for the future state of Bosnia, the problem of a
political settlement between Serbia and Croatia is crying out for attention.
Without such an understanding, which would doubtless require territorial
trade-offs, it seems improbable that lasting solutions can be reached for
more limited regional problems.

Mr Vaclav Havel, the philosopher-playwright who had to give up his
presidency of the Czechoslovak state, is expected to win the Czech
presidency with official support from the ruling coalition led by the Civic
Democratic party (ODS).
Critics of Mr Havel among the coalition may vote against him and force a
second ballot. He is opposed by candidates from the right-wing Republican
party and from the Communist party.
In Slovakia, Mr Roman Kovac, who had close ties with the Communist party
before the 1989 'Velvet Revolution' although he was not a party member, is
supported by the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.
He faces a more difficult challenge as he must win a three-fifths majority
to succeed.
He is opposed by candidates from the Slovak nationalist party, from the

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEARS ROEBUCK yesterday closed the book on its mail-order catalogue, a
distinctive part of American life for a century and the foundation of the
company's retail business.
The end of the catalogue business was announced as part of a restructuring
which will also result in the closure or disposal of 150 stores and the loss
of 16,000 full-time and 34,000 part-time jobs. Sears will take a Dollars
1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn) after-tax charge against earnings for the fourth
quarter of 1992.
'The catalogue is our heritage, it's how Sears started,' Mr Arthur Martinez,
who came from Saks Fifth Avenue last October to run Sears' troubled
merchandise division, said yesterday. 'However, we have concluded we cannot
improve our market position or achieve an acceptable return fast enough or
with sufficient certainty to justify remaining in the business.'
The catalogue has lost between Dollars 135m and Dollars 175m annually during
the past three years, despite circulating to 14m households and pulling in
sales revenues of about Dollars 3.3bn.
It traced its roots to 1887, when Richard Warren Sears, a former telegraph
agent with the Minneapolis and St Louis Railway, published his first
circular selling watches and jewellery.
By 1896, when the Sears general merchandise catalogue was launched, his
publication had expanded to 532 pages and offered products from clothing to
baby carriages.
For many decades, the business prospered, becoming a mainstay for isolated
farming communities in the midwestern US.
Sears moved into 'main street' retailing in the 1920s, building up a chain
of more than 800 department stores. The combined catalogue and high street
operations made Sears the largest US retailer in the US until the late
1980s.
Recently, however, Sears has faced mounting pressure from lower-cost rivals
 -discount chains such as Wal-Mart Stores and Kmart and the warehouse clubs.
In response, Sears has announced a series of restructuring measures, aimed
at lowering costs and improving efficiency.
Overall, 40,000 Sears jobs have been shed since 1990, although the retailer
still employs some 350,000 people.
Sears, based in Chicago, said that the latest overhaul, which will take a
year to implement, should improve after-tax profits by about Dollars 300m a
year.
It has four major elements:
Closure of the catalogue operation, based in Skokie, a Chicago suburb. This
move accounts for Dollars 800m of the Dollars 1.7bn restructuring charge.
Sears will, however, retain its profitable 'direct response' business, which
is a more streamlined form of mail order.
Closure of 113 of Sears' smaller retail outlets, plus disposal of its 35
Pinstripes Petites women's speciality stores.
Further job cuts, through an accelerated consolidation of various
administrative functions, plus a voluntary early retirement incentive
programme.
The 'repositioning' of major merchandise lines and service support
operations. For example, the Sears Tire and Auto Centers will focus on tyre
and battery sales and end certain other services, such as tune-ups.
The Dollars 1.7bn restructuring charge will be accompanied by Dollars 200m
write-down of real estate held by Homart, a property development subsidiary,
and a Dollars 1.9bn non-cash charge resulting from the change in US
accounting policy for non-pension retirement benefits.

FT  26 JAN 93 / BA and Virgin take steps to end dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS and Virgin Atlantic last night took a significant step
towards ending their bitter 'dirty tricks' row and imp-roving the badly
dented relationship between the two airlines.
A 1 1/2 -hour meeting between Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chief executive, and
Mr Richard Branson, the Virgin chairman, was described by the two men as 'a
very good first step'.
Both sides refused to disclose details of their talks, which took place at
Mr Branson's London home, but they are understood to have centred on
Virgin's demands for compensation for the financial and commercial damage it
claims to have suffered due to BA's covert activities.
Further meetings will be held between executives from both airlines 'to
resolve outstanding differences' over the next few weeks. The two sides
appear anxious to prevent any escalation in the long-running dispute which
centres on BA's earlier attempts to undermine its smaller rival.
Outside his home last night, Mr Branson said: 'Everybody had lots of cups of
tea and the atmosphere is a great deal warmer than a few weeks ago.'
Although Mr Branson appears to have had the upper hand throughout the
dispute, neither side believes it can risk prolonging what could become a
long and damaging feud for both.
BA is keen to restore its international reputation at a time when it is
pursuing its ambition to become a global airline. It is trying to establish
a partnership with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier, which could be
destabilised by any further legal action taken by Mr Branson. Last night the
'big three' US airlines - American, Delta and United - renewed their
opposition to any deal by urging the Clinton administration to declare a
moratorium on foreign investments in American carriers from countries with
restrictive aviation agreements with the US.
Mr Branson believes his legal dispute with BA has already taken up too much
of his airline's time, money and resources. Any US antitrust suit against BA
would prove a long and costly affair without any guarantee of Virgin's
success. However, Mr Branson said after the meeting that his terms for
reaching a final agreement with BA remained on the table: 'Nothing has been
dropped, but we hope the next meetings will sort everything out.'
Virgin went into the talks demanding compensation for the commercial damage
inflicted upon the airline by BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign. Before the
meeting, a Virgin official said the airline could have lost between Pounds
10m and Pounds 20m in revenues.
Virgin is also seeking a commitment from BA not to exploit private computer
reservation details. In addition, it wants use of BA aircraft servicing and
maintenance facilities which were withdrawn from the airline five years ago.
Sir Colin echoed Mr Branson's optimism and said he hoped for 'an amicable'
resolution. Both men refused to elaborate on the talks but said they would
meet again. They said there would be no public comment until then.
The talks took place two weeks after BA publicly apologised to Virgin and
paid Mr Branson Pounds 610,000 in a High Court libel settlement.
Alison Smith adds: At Westminster, Mr John Prescott, the shadow transport
secretary, accused the government of being 'paralysed' over the BA 'dirty
tricks' affair. He called on ministers to say what they intended to do about
the matter.

FT  26 JAN 93 / First tests of cancer vaccine on humans to start soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST human tests of a vaccine designed to prevent cancer will start at
the end of this year, the UK Cancer Research Campaign announced yesterday.
CRC researchers believe viral vaccines will become one of the main methods
of cancer prevention during the next century.
The new vaccine stops infection with the Epstein Barr Virus, which is known
to cause several types of cancer.
Only a few years ago most scientists would have dismissed the idea of a link
between viruses and cancer as wild speculation. However, recent evidence
suggests viruses are responsible for at least 20 per cent of all cancers -
perhaps 5m cases a year worldwide.
Epstein Barr Virus does most damage in China where it causes 60,000 deaths a
year from cancer of the nasal cavity, and in tropical Africa where it leads
to several thousand cases a year of Burkitt's Lymphoma, a childhood cancer.
In Europe and north America, the main health effect of EBV is to cause
glandular fever but recent evidence suggests it is also associated with
Hodgkin's Disease, a cancer of the lymph nodes which affects 1,200 people a
year in the UK.
Dr John Arrand is leading the EBV vaccine programme at the CRC's Paterson
Institute in Manchester in collaboration with CRC researchers in Bristol and
Birmingham.
Safety tests are due to start on about 20 healthy volunteers within a year.
The next step would be to test the vaccine's effectiveness in a larger
clinical trial, probably among university students who are not infected with
EBV. According to Professor Gordon McVie, CRC scientific director, 80 per
cent of un-infected undergraduates pick up the virus while they are at
university. EBV, a member of the herpes family of viruses, is spread by
kissing.
If that trial confirms that the vaccine prevents transmission of EBV, the
CRC will move on to extensive field trials in China and/or Africa in
collaboration with a commercial vaccine manufacturer. 'It may be 10 years
before we can show clearly that the vaccine prevents cancer,' Dr Arrand
says. But he foresees a time when EBV vaccine will be administered routinely
worldwide as an ingredient of the childhood vaccination cocktail.
Prof McVie says viruses are now known to cause at least a fifth of all
cancers, often in association with dietary or environmental factors. Apart
from EBV, three other cancer-causing viruses have been identified.

FT  26 JAN 93 / D-Mark rallies as Clinton plan to cut deficit hits dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK rallied strongly against the dollar yesterday on speculation that
the Bundesbank might not cut short-term interest rates as quickly as
financial markets had expected.
The weakness in the dollar was also the product of a growing belief that the
US Federal Reserve might not raise short-term interest rates now that the
Clinton administration has signalled a tough line on tackling the budget
deficit.
The D-Mark gained nearly 2 pfennigs against the dollar as dealers responded
to reports that public sector wage talks between the German government and
trade unions were deadlocked. A successful resolution of the talks had been
seen by the Bundesbank as a necessary precursor to any decision to cut
short-term German interest rates.
The dollar fell in European trading to a low of DM1.569, before closing 1.75
pfennigs down on the day at DM1.5725. That is more than 7 pfennigs lower
than its level three weeks ago. In New York the dollar closed at DM1.577,
and in early trading in Tokyo it was at DM1.5767.
The D-Mark was also underpinned by news that German inflation and money
supply, both central to the Bundesbank's interest rate policy, were still
not under control. The M3 measure of monetary growth expanded at an annual
rate of 8.8 per cent during December, compared with the central bank's
target maximum of 5.5 per cent.
Meanwhile, the annual rate of inflation in North Rhine Westphalia, Germany's
most heavily industrialised and most populous state, rose a full percentage
point last month to 4.2 per cent - more than double the Bundesbank's ideal
level.
The revised expectations over German monetary policy helped to push French
money market rates higher, as dealers feared that interest rate cuts in
Europe might be delayed. Three-month French francs also firmed sharply to 12
1/4 per cent from about 11 3/4 per cent last Friday.
The Bank of France has kept short-term money market rates high as part of
its strategy of defending the franc in the European exchange rate mechanism.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany warned yesterday that the EC would not
allow currency speculators to wreck the ERM.
The growth in German M3, a measure which includes cash, short-term deposits
and fixed-term savings accounts, marked a further fall from October's peak
of 10.3 per cent when figures were distorted by the previous month's
interventions during the European exchange rate crisis.
The Bundesbank pointed out that in absolute terms the German money stock had
grown by DM142bn between the end of 1991 and the final quarter of 1992 - at
double the rate recorded in the previous year.
The RWI institute in Essen, meanwhile, forecast that industry would start to
recover later this year, thanks to exports.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Accidents at work 'cost up to Pounds 15bn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKPLACE accidents and ill-health cost Britain Pounds 10bn-Pounds 15bn a
year, with employers bearing Pounds 4bn-Pounds 9bn of the expense, according
to an investigation due to be published by the Health and Safety Executive.
Employers appear to be seriously underestimating the true cost of accidents
and wrongly assume that they will be fully covered by insurance, Mr John
Rimington, HSE director-general, said yesterday.
'Boards of directors need to take full and proper account of what these
events are actually costing them,' he said.
The estimates are the first attempt to put a realistic price tag on
occupational injuries and ill-health since the discovery in 1991 that
official figures were seriously flawed.
A survey of 40,000 households revealed then that more than two-thirds of
workplace accidents remained unreported in breach of the law - a far higher
proportion than previously thought.
The latest study, to be published in full in May, calculates the costs to
society of occupational accidents and illness. The estimates include social
security and National Health Service expenses, as well as financial and
other losses suffered by victims. The total cost is equivalent to 1.75-2.75
per cent of gross domestic product, the HSE said.
About 1.6m accidents resulting in injury are estimated to occur each year
and about 750,000 workers suffer occupational ill-health which results in
time off work.
For employers, costs of accidents and ill-health include Pounds 750m paid in
employers' liability insurance to cover compensation to injured workers, the
cost of recruiting and training replacements for those forced to give up
work and the cost of property loss. Employers' expenses equalled 5-10 per
cent of gross trading profits, the HSE estimated.
Detailed case studies of five organisations showed that companies' uninsured
costs could be between eight and 36 times greater than the costs of
insurance premiums.
This is substantially greater than the ratio of 4:1 which is commonly used
by industrial safety experts to estimate the total costs of accidents within
individual organisations.
Typically, companies pay for employers', product and public liability
insurance, but fail to calculate fully the costs arising from accidents of
production delays, fines, legal fees and management and clerical time taken
up by investigations.
Mr Rimington said the HSE had been surprised by the results of the case
studies. The Costs of Accidents at Work. Health and Safety Executive.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UN orders Croats to pull back: Two French peacekeepers
killed, Yugoslav army on alert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council early today demanded the withdrawal of
Croatian troops which have conducted a four-day offensive across
peace-keeping lines into Serb-held territory.
The council strongly condemned Croatian attacks against the UN Protection
Force and called for the return of heavy weapons which the defending Serbs
have taken from UN bases.
Yesterday the Yugoslav army, which is dominated by Serbs, placed its forces
on a higher state of combat readiness because of the Croatian advance near
the Adriatic port of Zadar. This is aimed at capturing territory enabling
the Croats to rebuild the Maslenica bridge linking the north and south
Croatian coastlines.
In advance of the Security Council statement, Croatia said it sought a new
ceasefire line 20km south-east of the previous one. This would be within the
UN protected area in Krajina, the disputed Serb enclave.
The Croatian demand, spelled out by Admiral Sveto Letica, a Croatian
commander liaising with the UN Protection Force, is likely to exacerbate
tensions in Krajina.
Two French UN peacekeepers were killed yesterday in crossfire in Karin
Placa, near Zadar, and Croatia said its forces had overrun Zemunik airport,
a strategic base.
At the same time, fighting intensified between Serbs and Moslem forces in
eastern Bosnia, along its border with Serbia.
The Bosnian peace conference in Geneva continued to be overshadowed by the
fighting between Serbs and Croats and made no progress towards agreement on
a map of the provincial boundaries of the future state of
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
In Belgrade, a statement issued by the Supreme Defence Council, chaired by
president Dobrica Cosic of Yugoslavia which comprises Serbia and Montenegro,
said 'the latest Croatian and Moslem offensives have worsened the security
situation in the region and threatened the Geneva negotiations and the UN
peace plan', Belgrade-based news agency Tanjug reported.
Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russian deputy foreign minister, said Moscow might press
for international sanctions against Zagreb if the Croatian attacks
persisted.
The latest Croatian advance contradicted an announcement on Sunday night by
Croatian president Franjo Tudjman that the offensive was over because the
country had achieved its strategic goals. Surprisingly, Serbian president
Slobodan Milosevic appeared to be playing down the fighting in Croatia.
He declined to stir up nationalist passions as he has done in the past.
Instead, in a parliamentary address, he said Serbia had three priorities:
'Peace, economic development and the fight against crime.'
But Mr Vojislav Seselj, the ultra-nationalist Serb leader and a favourite of
Mr Milosevic, accused Mr Cosic of striking a secret deal with Mr Tudjman.
Independent analysts also speculated that the Serb and Yugoslav presidents
had secretly agreed to Croatia taking control of the Maslenica region in
exchange for the corridor linking Serb-controlled territories in Bosnia to
Serbia.

<TEXT>
A cosy chat and a cup of tea seem to have thawed the frosty relations
between Mr Richard Branson and Sir Colin Marshall. Although Virgin may yet
press ahead with a claim against BA for up to Pounds 20m in lost revenues,
the airline appears keen to call an end to the time-consuming dispute. The
alternative prospect of convoluted anti-trust legislation in the US has
little appeal. BA may thus struggle through without much further
embarrassment. Shareholders can then get back to worrying full-time about
BA's sickly passenger figures.

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The conventional view of the relationship between equities and gilt-edged
stock suggests the former are currently cheap since they yield half as much
as gilts. The yield ratio is at the bottom of a range that traditionally
fluctuates between 2 and around 2.5. According to a paper written for the
Institute of Actuaries by Mr Peter Jones of James Capel this view is flawed
since it ignores changes in the rate of dividend growth.
Equities strongly outperformed gilts during the 1980s because dividend
growth constantly surprised even professional investors. Now there is a
tendency to assume that high growth rates are normal. Yet if, despite the
exit from the ERM, the UK is entering a period of low growth and inflation,
dividend growth may start to disappoint. The yield ratio would then be
sending a different message.
The harder question is where the boundaries should be set. Mr Jones believes
dividend growth would have to return to around 6 per cent by 1994 to justify
present equity valuations. That looks plausible on the basis of a rebound of
earnings after the recession, but touch-and-go when present levels of
dividend cover and the likely trend of nominal GDP are taken into account.
There may yet be grounds for switching into gilts, especially by pension
funds that are heavily overweight in equities.

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: NFC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the market was quick to appreciate yesterday, NFC will receive a boost if
the disposal of its waste management business goes ahead at the indicated
price of around Pounds 100m. Although the rubbish market has become highly
fashionable of late, NFC would have to invest heavily to ensure its
subsidiary's continued success. Its money could be better spent expanding
its core distribution businesses. A gearing ratio of 55 per cent currently
constrains these ambitions. This disposal would restore its flexibility by
halving net debt.
Whether Wessex Water and the US-based Waste Management are as wise to
contemplate paying such a hefty sum is another matter. The mooted price
represents a spectacular premium for a business which may make profits of
less than Pounds 4m this year. The worry is that Wessex Water will overpay
in its determination to expand into areas which escape the industry
regulator's gaze - although Waste Management's record suggests it would
temper any such impulse. Nevertheless, water companies are still struggling
to prove the value of diversification. Certainly, Severn Trent's purchase of
the Biffa waste business has yet to prove its worth.

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Sears Roebuck
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sears Roebuck's decision to to pull out of catalogue retailing at least
proves that the company is no longer sentimental about the business which
made it great. It seems Mr Arthur Martinez, brought in last year to give the
backward-looking giant a fresh perspective, can carry the board on tough
issues. Last autumn's announcement that the financial services operations
were to go has now been followed by closure of the worst stores and some
sensible cost-cutting.
But these defensive measures do not add up to a strategy. The core business
has been squeezed between discount retailers and specialist stores. Previous
initiatives such as everyday low pricing of goods have failed to halt the
decline - as UK imitators such as Kingfisher might care to note. Focusing on
a smaller area may concentrate management minds, but there is as yet little
evidence of the required retailing spark. Sears apparently wishes to expand
its women's wear operations, which have improved substantially in recent
years. Yet that will bring it into even closer competition with its rival JC
Penney in a fiercely fought market.
One priority must be to get rid of the company's staid image. That will
require top management to modernise the stores and, more importantly, the
culture of Sears' army of sales staff. Such strategic shifts are tough.
Changing the public image of a retailer is the hardest task of all.

FT  26 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Muddled about money
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The conflicting signals in yesterday's money supply data provide a perfect
excuse for the chancellor to do nothing about interest rates for the time
being. While M4 growth has fallen below its target floor of 4 per cent, the
narrow M0 measure looks set to rise above its ceiling this month. Together
with the cheerier news on confidence emanating from the CBI, that goes some
way to offsetting last week's gloomy news on employment, production and
retail sales.
Even if the economy is not in a desperate plight, though, it is hard to
discern anything more than anaemic recovery. Consumers may be prepared to
spend a little more of the real wage increases they are enjoying if they are
still in work, but only when they are offered discount prices and not if it
means going into debt. The weakness of bank lending is particularly
striking. It seems to confirm that, while some prices are moving in response
to devaluation, there is little demand-pull inflationary pressure in the
pipeline. M0 may have breached its target, but the ceiling was unduly low in
the first place.
That leaves room for interest rate cuts at some stage, perhaps after the
Bundesbank's intentions are clearer. The money supply trend creates an
opportunity for the government to relax the rules preventing sales of gilts
to banks being counted towards PSBR funding. The move would only reduce the
flow of gilts, however, if banks could be persuaded to buy more paper. All
the more reason to steepen the yield curve by cutting short-term rates.

Still on the subject of contra cyclical stock-market indicators, Observer
has noticed another worrying sign. City stockbrokers who retired to run
small breweries in the country are starting to re-emerge in the City
Graham Axford, one-time corporate finance chief at James Capel, last month
gave up the chairmanship of the tiny Wiltshire brewery - makers of Old
Grumble - to return as head of corporate finance at Credit Lyonnais Laing.
Now Observer hears that John Dunsmore, once the City's number one brewing
analyst, is giving up his directorship of Midland's brewer Marstons, so that
he can rejoin NatWest Securities as head of equities. Hard to believe that
overcapacity in brewing is worse than in stockbroking. But whatever the
reason, Dunsmore's return is another sign of the rehabilitation of NatWest's
once troubled broking business.

<TEXT>
After years of profiting from falling share prices, the Feshbach brothers of
California, the most famous short-sellers in the US, have begun buying
stocks - a U-turn comparable to Prince Charles announcing that he is
forsaking polo for the game of darts.
Although they made millions of dollars in the 1980s by searching out
companies on the brink of disaster and selling their stock short, the three
brothers have been hard hit recently by the steady upward climb of US stock
prices. In 1991, when US equities rose sharply, Feshbachs' clients lost
between 40 and 60 per cent in value. Last year, rising share prices again
left the Feshbachs nursing losses.
Consequently, they have decided to buy stocks as a hedge against further
advances in the market. At first glance, this strategic shift looks like a
vote of confidence in equities. It might, however, be worth taking a
contrary view on this one. When the most famous bears in the business
announce they are buying stocks - is not this the right time to be getting
out of the market?

Take your partners please for the Johnson Matthey waltz. Suitors,
stakeholders and others interested in the future of one of the most famous
precious metals groups are taking sides in what promises to be one of the
more complicated takeover routines of the season.
Merchant bankers Hambros and Barings are already stepping out with Charter
Consolidated and Johnson Matthey, and SG Warburg made its debut yesterday at
the bottom of a Minorco press release.
Given that Peter Wilmott-Sitwell, chairman of SG Warburg Securities, has
recently gone on to the Minorco board, Warburg's return to centre stage is
no great surprise. Britain's premier merchant bank and South Africa's Anglo
American Corp have been getting closer and closer together and Anglo holds
the key to JM's future.
This latest liaison presumably leaves out in the cold Morgan Grenfell,
Minorco's banker during the infamous Consolidated Gold Fields bid, and
raises the question of whether Warburg's arrival will result in James Capel,
Minorco's broker, being jilted. However, all is not lost, Johannesburg
Consolidated Investments may still be looking for a merchant banker to
partner its broker, Smith New Court.

How much longer will America be prepared to accept the invasion of its media
by journalists from its colonial past? Yesterday Martin Dunn, editor of
Today - Britain's fastest growing newspaper - joined the westbound trek.
Dunn had been pinning his hopes on getting the editorship of one of New
York's ailing daily newspapers. In the event he has had to make do with the
Boston Herald. His owner, Rupert Murdoch, has never had much luck with his
US newspapers, and presumably now feels that his best chance of making a
success with his sole remaining US daily is to import a former deputy editor
of The Sun. It's hard to believe there is no US journalist up to the job.
The Fleet Street invasion is already the subject of serious study. Columbia
University is holding a seminar next month entitled 'The British are
coming', which includes contributions from recent UK imports such as the
editors of the National Review, The New Republic and TV Guide. And judging
by the latest issue of Spy Magazine, a backlash against foreigners taking
high-paying jobs away from Americans is spreading.
Spy, whose co-founding Canadian editor now fills Britain's Tina Brown's spot
at Vanity Fair, is concerned that the New Yorker, the city's most famous
magazine, now has a London-based theatre critic, a British film critic and a
foreign editor of its Talk of the Town column who had never heard of Page
Six of the New York Post - a journalistic gaffe equal to not knowing about
Page 3 of the Sun.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Europe's uneven playing field
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HABIT, common among Europe's governments, of giving handouts to industry
has never been good. Such handouts usually waste taxpayers' money and breed
a dependency culture among the recipients. But the potential damage of state
aid to industry is compounded by the start of the single market earlier this
month. The removal of trade barriers means that inefficient companies
subsidised by one member state could drive more efficient enterprises
elsewhere out of business - exactly the reverse of what the single market is
intended to achieve.
The need for an assault on subsidies has never been greater. But the omens
for effective action by the European Commission, which is responsible for
policing state aid, are not good. First, Mr Karel van Miert, the new
competition commissioner, has indicated that he may take a softer line on
aid. Second, the deepening recession is leading to clamours for assistance
throughout the Community. Finally, the Commission's overall ability to take
controversial decisions has been undermined by the widespread feeling that
Brussels is interfering in national affairs.
Meanwhile, the balance of opinion among member states is fluid. The UK,
which has traditionally taken a robust line against aid, is wavering. Having
lobbied the Commission to approve subsidies for its coal industry, it will
not be in a position to lecture others for giving excessive handouts. On the
other hand, the Italian government, which has been generous with aid, seems
to be changing tack and the same could happen in France after March's
election.
Subsidy wars
In theory, there should be no problem. Rules banning most types of
government assistance to industry are set out in the Treaty of Rome. There
is little wrong with the rules and the debate on 'subsidiarity' does not, in
this area, provide any excuse for giving the power to enforce them to
national governments. The only chance of preventing subsidy wars is action
at Community and, ideally in the long run, global levels.
But there is still an enforcement problem, because of heavy lobbying by
vested interests. The large and often state-owned companies which receive
the bulk of aid are effective at extracting assistance from their national
governments, which then lobby the Commission for approval. Meanwhile, the
general public - who pay for the subsidies in the form of taxes, price rises
or unemployment in other parts of the economy - do not know what is going
on, because decisions are taken behind closed doors. The result is that even
a determined competition commissioner such as Sir Leon Brittan had only
limited success in cutting the overall level of subsidies which averaged
Ecu89bn a year between 1988 and 1990.
Transparent process
The solution is to make the whole process of policing state aid more
transparent. Much of the aid currently approved would probably not survive
the full glare of public accountability.
Australia's Industry Commission, an independent body which scrutinises all
forms of assistance to industry, is an example of what can be achieved
through openness. Before reaching a view, it holds public hearings and
publishes consultative documents. It also regularly reviews aid cases after
they are approved to assess costs and see whether assistance has had its
intended effect. The result of this rigorous and open process has been to
cut Australian industry's dependence on state aid by about two-thirds in the
last 20 years.
It is doubtful whether there would be political support for establishing a
similar institution in the European Community. Even if there were, it could
be difficult to ensure its independence from political interference by
national governments. But the Commission should certainly take steps in this
direction by opening up its decisions on state aid to public scrutiny -
which would also help reduce the Community's democratic deficit - and
reviewing aid cases after they have been approved. Without action on these
lines, Mr Van Miert will have great difficulty creating a level playing
field. And, without that, the single market could fall into disrepute.

FT  26 JAN 93 / A window on the world: AT&amp;T is positioning itself to take
advantage of the increasing convergence of technologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bizarre decoration hangs in an otherwise bland executive conference room
at the New Jersey headquarters of AT&amp;T's Network Systems business, which
makes capital equipment for the telecommunications industry. It is a small,
scruffy, four-paned window which would be more at home in a junkyard.
It looks like the creation of a particularly challenging modern artist,
though in reality it is an unusual management teaching aid.
Placed on the wall of the windowless conference room by Mr Bill Marx, who
heads Network Systems, it is a symbolic reminder to his executives of the
need to be looking outwards, trying to anticipate customers' needs.
The window could also serve as a symbol of a remarkable shake-up in the
entire AT&amp;T group since the watershed year of 1984. That was when the
company, previously a US national telephone monopoly known as Ma Bell, was
forced to divest its local telephone operations into seven separate
businesses - the so-called Baby Bells - in settlement of an anti-trust legal
battle.
Since then, the rump AT&amp;T, which remains the largest long-distance
telecommunications business in the US, has been turned from an
inward-looking, complacent bureaucracy into an aggressive global competitor.
It is positioning itself to benefit from what may be the most significant
industrial upheaval of the next two decades: the expected convergence of
telecommunications, computers and video to create a single multi-media
industry serving many new markets.
For example, the day may not be too far off when affluent westerners are
equipped with wireless, hand-held devices which allow them not just to talk,
but see each other in video images, receive and send fax messages, and
communicate with computers.
AT&amp;T wants to be a giant spider at the centre of such webs of communications
technology, providing equipment, the knowhow to link it up and, most
important, the communications network through which to transmit the traffic.
Mr Bob Allen, AT&amp;T's chairman, says it aims to become 'the world's best at
bringing people together, giving them easy access to each other and to the
information and services they want and need - anytime, anywhere'.
His global ambitions are being helped by political as well as technological
change. Governments are deregulating and privatising their
telecommunications services industries, unleashing powerful competitive
forces which are pushing national carriers into convoluted networks of
global alliances.
Almost every month brings fresh examples of AT&amp;T's vigorous pursuit of its
strategy. In September it celebrated the first anniversary of its Dollars
7.5bn takeover of US computer company NCR. In November it announced plans to
get into the cellular telephone service business by taking a 33 per cent
stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest operator in the US, with
the option of majority control later.
And over the past few weeks it has forged an alliance with Novell, the
computer software group, to develop products linking computer networks with
telephones, and agreed to take a stake in Unitel, a Canadian long-distance
company.
In the age of multi-media, AT&amp;T may have a unique advantage, for it is the
world's only information technology company with large interests in three
crucial areas - telecommunications services; telecommunications equipment
manufacturing, where it serves both the capital and consumer markets; and
computers, where the NCR takeover has given critical mass to AT&amp;T's
previously loss-making operations.
It also owns Bell Laboratories, arguably the world's finest corporate
research and development centre. AT&amp;T is co-developer of a technology for
high definition television (HDTV) that could be chosen this year as the US
national standard. And Wall Street thinks the group wants to round out its
multi-media interests by forming a partnership with a large US cable-TV
operator.
Mr Robert Morris, an analyst with investment bank Goldman Sachs, says that,
if AT&amp;T can pull off its 'communacopia' strategy, 'then I don't think there
will be any other company in the world which can duplicate what they have
done'.
Mr Allen, however, is still a long way from proving the strategy a winner.
No one knows just how convergence between the industries will work in
practice, while AT&amp;T, with a chequered financial record since it divested
the Baby Bells, has to show it can deliver strong, sustained earnings
growth.
Still, the company is looking more like a winner than at any time since it
lost its cosy status as a regulated monopoly. That opened it to fierce
competition in the long-distance market from relative newcomers such as MCI
Communications and Sprint, while in the equipment market it had to fight for
previously captive Baby Bell contracts against foreign competitors such as
Northern Telecom of Canada and Alcatel of France.
This was a blessing in disguise, as it shook the company out of the kind of
complacency that has led to profound troubles at two other leading US
industrial groups - International Business Machines and General Motors. 'We
look back on divestiture as a springboard for new energy in the
corporation,' says Mr Marx.
Yet the most radical change in AT&amp;T's deep-seated bureaucratic culture
arrived only after Mr Allen took over as chairman in 1988 on the unexpected
death of the then incumbent, Mr James Olsen.
Mr Allen, 58 yesterday, looks an unlikely revolutionary. A tall, slim man
with a conservative dress sense, soft voice and undemonstrative manner, he
is the son of a small business owner from a small mid-western town and has
worked inside the Bell system since leaving college. Yet he also has a
reputation for strategic analysis, a quietly wry sense of humour and
stubborn determination.
He quickly reorganised the monolithic business into 20 separate product
areas and made each responsible for the first time for its own pricing,
marketing, product development and profits.
This pointed up where the group was making and losing money and forced
individual businesses to focus more closely on cutting fat. Some 60,000 jobs
have been axed over the past four years. At the same time, the shake-up has
greatly accelerated decision-making, and made the businesses increasingly
aware of customer needs.
Mr Victor Pelson, who heads the telecommunications services side of the
business, says: 'Whereas five years ago we had maybe a dozen people making
the fundamental decisions on how to serve a marketplace, today we have
literally hundreds. That's an enormous change.'
The cultural revolution - not yet complete - has been helped by the fact
that more than half AT&amp;T's employees have joined the group since 1984. Most
have also been exposed to Total Quality Management - the popular theory that
says companies must devote prodigious energies to satisfying their
customers.
A new willingness to hire senior executives from outside represents another
cultural change. Mr Alex Mandl, the highly regarded chief financial officer,
came from conglomerate CSX, while another senior executive, Mr Jerre Stead,
was formerly president of Square D, a large electrical components group. Mr
David Stone, a leading software strategist, was recently lured from computer
company Digital Equipment.
AT&amp;T is also becoming more international. Sudden competition at home after
1984 forced it to look abroad for new markets, but its early moves were
clumsy, with the collapse of alliances with Philips of the Netherlands and
Italy's Olivetti.
The group is now moving with more confidence, as demonstrated by two deals
last year in eastern Europe: it is playing an important role in the
modernisation of the Ukraine's telecommunications system, and was the first
western company to invest in Poland's equipment business.
It has moved the headquarters of its corded telephone business from the US
to France. 'It took us a while to get it - that to compete in Europe we had
to be European,' says Mr Robert Kavner, head of Communications Products.
The NCR takeover has greatly expanded the international business - the
computer company has 60 per cent of its sales outside the US - and Mr Allen
suggests AT&amp;T could get 50 per cent of its revenues from abroad by 2000,
compared with some 24 per cent now.
All this has combined to make AT&amp;T a much more profitable business, with net
income before special charges roughly doubling between 1984 and 1991.
The company's long-term target is earnings growth of at least 10 per cent a
year, and it is expected to announce 1992 results which meet that goal. Even
its subsidiary making PBX business phone systems, which has been losing
money for years, is back in the black.
Yet most of this improvement has come from efficiency gains rather than
business growth. In the long-distance market, which still provides some 60
per cent of revenues and an estimated 80 per cent of income, AT&amp;T's profit
margins are thought to be the best in the business, thanks to high
productivity and modern, digital technology.
However, its long-distance revenues have been virtually static since 1984,
even though the US market has been enjoying solid volume growth - more than
10 per cent a year in the 1980s, dipping to 6-7 per cent in the recent
recession.
AT&amp;T has been losing market share to its rivals - on one measure it is down
from more than 80 per cent of call volume in 1984 to about 60 per cent now.
The effects on revenue have been compounded by a price war in 1990-91 and
the insistence of government regulators that the long-distance carriers pass
on to consumers cuts in their biggest cost, the access charges paid to local
telephone companies to complete calls.
Over the past two years AT&amp;T's market share erosion has slowed as it has
adopted a more aggressive marketing stance. This has ranged from price cuts
to the launch of its own credit card, offering discounts on calls, which in
little more than two years has become the second most widely held card in
the US.
US recovery from recession will boost long-distance traffic, but AT&amp;T needs
to encourage more intensive use of its network, preferably by customers who
need more sophisticated services, which generate higher revenues. This helps
explain much of its interest in multi-media as well as the proposed McCaw
deal.
McCaw will catapult AT&amp;T from nowhere into the leading position in cellular,
the fastest-growing part of US telecommunications, with annual US growth
rates of 30 to 40 per cent. The deal has shocked the Baby Bells, which
operate rival cellular services to McCaw's, since it potentially brings AT&amp;T
into local competition with them for the first time since 1984.
Observers suggest AT&amp;T might eventually try to link its long-distance
network directly into McCaw's, thus getting round paying access charges to
the local telephone companies. But AT&amp;T says it simply needs a presence in
cellular to serve customers, who will increasingly demand integrated
communications networks.
The same long-term logic underlay the takeover of NCR, though the initial
goal was to use NCR's expertise to turn AT&amp;T's much smaller computer
business to profit. Some 18 months on from the merger, the two businesses
appear to have gelled well, and the combined group is modestly profitable -
a reasonable achievement, given the red ink at many other large computer
companies.
It is, however, too early to say whether the merger will develop into more
than the sum of its parts, with NCR helping AT&amp;T win contracts for
integrated communications and computer networks, and both sides throwing up
important new technology ideas.
That said, they have already jointly developed an automatic teller machine
that will identify a bank customer by voice, rather than numbers punched in
a keyboard. And they are working on one that would allow customers to summon
up a bank clerk for a conversation on an ATM video screen.
Mr Gilbert Williamson, the NCR chairman, says the early results from six
teams looking at cross-fertilisation makes him 'really enthusiastic about
the potential'.
Still, AT&amp;T's overall strategy could have some big pitfalls. First, the Baby
Bells, still the main customers for its telecommunications capital
equipment, may be reluctant to buy from a direct, cellular competitor. Nor
is it clear that large corporate customers will want to entrust so much of
their business to mighty AT&amp;T.
The history of IBM over the past decade shows that huge, integrated
technology companies are not necessarily a match for a collection of nimble,
niche players.
However, senior executives across AT&amp;T insist that the most successful
companies in the coming revolution will be those that can provide simple,
transparent solutions to customers' complex communications problems. AT&amp;T,
they say, is positioning itself to do just that.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Privatising British Rail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A POLL TAX on wheels? A privatisation too far? If anything is clear about
the government's plans for breaking up British Rail, it is that they
threaten to turn into one of the most controversial privatisations yet. With
the few faint voices of support drowned by objections from every quarter, it
is tempting to conclude that the government has got it badly wrong.
Until last week's publication of the railways bill, the arguments about
privatisation had turned largely on the issue of whether fragmentation of
the railway was feasible. Many of the rail lobby's attacks on the proposals
were lost on a public that cared little about the technicalities of
divorcing track ownership from the running of the trains or franchising out
the passenger services.
Now, however, with the government signalling its determination to press
ahead, passengers are rightly beginning to raise more down-to-earth
concerns. Will fares go up? Will lines close? Will services be cut? Will
investment slump? Above all, will the railways get better or worse?
These concerns are justified. Railway privatisation is a voyage into the
unknown: no other country has yet accomplished it (although Germany, for
one, is pursuing a similar course to Britain's). Successive Conservative
governments have dithered over it, fearing the political consequences of
meddling with an organisation which, while maddeningly inefficient, ranks
not much lower in public concern than the National Health Service.
Need for action
And yet, as the government has finally acknowledged in bringing forward its
proposals, something had to be done. If the railways were working well,
there would be an argument for leaving them alone. As it is, even with some
of the highest fares in Europe, they are under-invested; passengers are
still too often made to feel as though they are an encumbrance to the
running of the railway, rather than the reason for it; and the trains do not
run on time.
Privatisation has already raised investment levels and transformed
management in many other industries. It could do the same for the railways.
But the question that lies at the heart of the public's worries is whether
the government has chosen the right way of achieving it - not least since
the proposals look so complex that almost no one outside the Department of
Transport even pretends to understand them.
Blindingly simple
In truth, the plans are blindingly simple. Rather than attempt a wholesale
privatisation, the government has reined back its ambitions in favour of
something more pragmatic. On the passenger side, it plans to retain the
tracks and, over a period of 10 years or more, contract out the operation of
existing train services to private sector franchisees by competitive tender.
If there is spare capacity left on the tracks, other companies will in some
cases be allowed to run the odd train here and there in competition with
services operated by the main franchisees.
In principle, there seems little to fear from such a cautious approach.
Ministers say loss-making passenger services (which is to say, nearly all
those operated by BR) will continue to attract subsidies, so there is no
reason why any should close. When the franchising authority contracts them
out, it will be on the basis of today's service levels and fares, so there
should be no big changes on either score; and beyond that, minimum services
and maximum fares will be laid down for the duration of the franchise.
Yet many issues remain to be resolved before the government can hope to win
confidence in its proposals. Ministerial assurances about the franchising
regime are not enough: still to come is the small print that reveals exactly
how they will work. Similarly, the yet-to-be published plans for the track
charging regime will be crucial to the prospects of attracting new services
to the railways. Nor is it known how the government is to avoid a damaging
hiatus in investment during the transition from the old regime to the new.
Even if the government can satisfy its critics on these issues, it could
still be blown off course by its own backbenchers in the present risk-averse
climate. That would be more than a pity: for if the government gets it
right, its plan presents the best prospect of providing Britain with the
attractive and well-run railway it needs.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Letter: Freedom for central bank only hope for stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Rt Hon ALAN BEITH MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The attack on the idea of central bank independence by Sir Bryan Hopkin
and Sir Douglas Wass (Personal View January 22), which was made more topical
by that day's announcement of Eddie George's appointment as governor, was
redolent of the 1960s. They even quoted the Bank's responsibility for
exchange controls as an argument against its independence, as if this ghost
of policies past was about to walk again. They point to the lack of an
anti-inflation culture in Britain while at the same time arguing that we
should maintain that deficiency by pretending that there is a choice between
high unemployment and inflation, and by denying ourselves the one weapon
which could institutionalise price stability.
Without making monetary policy the independent responsibility of the central
bank, we have no hope of convincing the markets that price stability will be
maintained: the political pressures arising from our home loans system and
the short term nature of much small business finance will obviously weigh
heavily on any chancellor, and if he has the likes of Sir Brian and Sir
Douglas advising him, he will be explicitly invited to regard other factors
as more compelling than price stability.
Mr George is pleased to have been invited by the chancellor to support the
government's policy of defeating inflation. What will he do if the policy
changes or if his advice on what is necessary to achieve price stability is
ignored?

FT  26 JAN 93 / Letter: Recruitment subsidies likely to have only a marginal
impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER ASHBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader on unemployment ('Harsh fare for the jobless', January 22)
goes some way towards supporting the introduction of a new safety net of
temporary work for the very long-term unemployed. However, you then suggest
that employment subsidies might be a 'better option'. There is much to be
said for the government testing out a system of recruitment subsidies to
persuade more employers to recruit the very long-term unemployed. We should
not, though, expect too much from the offer of subsidies; over the years,
surveys among employers have shown that 'bribes' are likely to have little
more than a marginal impact on their recruitment practices. It would be a
mistake if they were to distract us from the need for a new policy framework
for the long-term unemployed, based on a two-way contract between them and
the government.
The government should be prepared to offer the unemployed temporary work if
they are unable to return to employment after 18 months on the register. In
return, the long-term unemployed should only receive their income from
society as a condition of undertaking this work.
Such an approach commands wide respect among the long-term unemployed, as
essentially fair, and immeasurably better than the status quo, which
effectively traps many into a life outside the world of work.
If there is any one lesson which we should learn from the severity of the
current recession, it is surely that everyone in work, even the most highly
skilled, should see themselves as a potential victim of unemployment - and,
therefore, potentially a beneficiary of the new contract now needed, so
urgently, between long-term unemployed people and society.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Less than sum of its parts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Subsidising coal mines is barmy. Permanent handouts to a dirty industry in
long-term decline are indefensible in any economy. In a free market the very
idea is inexplicable. Adding yet further subsidies would be positively
wicked.
The purpose of keeping pits open is said to be to save jobs. This is true,
but it is fear of losing ministers' jobs, not miners', that motivates the
government. There are 20 men and two women in the cabinet. A Pounds 500m a
year subsidy works out at a save-the-job contribution from taxpayers (or
electricity consumers) of very nearly Pounds 23m per minister per annum.
That is a definition of value for money that even Lambeth borough council
might question.
The actual cost of the backhander, which Mr Michael Heseltine is expected to
announce in a few weeks, may be less than Pounds 500m. The latter is merely
a figure floating in the air. Yet the president of the Board of Trade
maintains that coal is already supported to the tune of Pounds 1bn a year.
It is not clear whether he is proposing to add to that huge sum, or merely
not subtract from it. Either way, he may be obliged to limit the largesse he
contrives to transfer from the general population to workers in an industry
that should have been shut down long ago.
We do not yet know. We are told that no final decision has yet been taken.
That is what most politicians say when they are scared witless by the
prospect of being seen to have settled on any of a set of disagreeable
options laid out on a list before them. In this instance one of the virtues
of delay is that the debate can be held in semi-public, by means of leaks,
innuendoes, working papers and parliamentary select committee reports.
Meanwhile, Mr Heseltine can do what he is best at. He can soften up public
opinion. The entire process is a crutch for scaredy-cat decision-making. The
government is free to choose. Choose what? Not the best energy policy. That
is not what it is looking for. It is seeking the cheapest, most
trouble-free, most survival-proof package that its back-benchers can be
persuaded to accept.
This explains why the cabinet has been engaged in what most of us would call
a squabble, but Mr Major prefers to look upon as a discussion. Over the
weekend those prolific midwives, Ms Inspired Rumour and Ms Purposeful
Kite-flying, appeared to assist in the birth of a new consensus. If this
holds we will be obliged to pay a political bribe to the coal industry for
the next five years, that is, beyond the next election. The select committee
on industry prefers a two to three year payout. As a small consolation, the
subsidy will be reduced each year. The air will hum with promises. Half or
more of the pits scheduled for closure last year will be 'saved'. There will
be much talk of a new energy policy. The eventual result, we will be
assured, will be a self-financing, privatised coal industry. The chimneys of
power stations that use its products will emit Chanel No 5.
It is all short-sighted nonsense, supported by four voluminous studies
commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry and published last
Friday. The only piece of foresight in any of these tomes is the last
sentence of the report on markets for coal prepared by Caminus Energy Ltd.
'The advantage which gas has over coal would be further enhanced if carbon
taxes were imposed in order to meet environmental goals to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions,' says Caminus. The consultants might have added that the
optimum medium-term strategy for coal is to stop mining. This view is
supported by the evidence in a slim discussion paper on climate change
published by the Department of the Environment just before Christmas.
The purpose of that document, presented with some glee by the environment
secretary, Mr Michael Howard, is to initiate a debate on how Britain can
reduce its CO output. The government is committed, by its signature in Rio
last year, to bring emissions of the main greenhouse gas down to 1990 levels
by the year 2000. President Bill Clinton made the same promise in his
campaign literature. Mr Howard's paper notes flatly that '96 per cent of the
UK's man-made carbon dioxide emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels
for energy use'.
It makes further telling points. Generating electricity from gas produces
about half as much CO per unit as does coal. A carbon tax would be 'likely
to have the greatest impact on energy use by industry'. Such a tax has been
proposed by the European Community. It is likely to be considered by the new
US administration, especially with Vice-president Al Gore around to make his
case. Mr Howard, who is one of the ministers who might conceivably succeed
Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor, has, however, ducked the issue. Alluding to
the whole package of possible government measures to reduce CO emissions,
his paper intimated that decisions will be taken in the light of whatever Mr
Heseltine gets away with on coal.
A similar po-faced neutrality informs the environment secretary's paragraphs
on transport. These show that the worst offender, in CO terms, is road
traffic. Public transport creates fewer emissions per passenger kilometre
than private cars. The lessons are apparent. Do not commercialise the
railways in such a manner that train services are likely to be further
reduced. Charge more for petrol, as the Americans eventually will. Introduce
toll roads. Use taxes and perhaps tradeable permits to reflect the true
environmental costs of various forms of transport.
You can easily deduce most of this, although not in such stark terms, from
Mr Howard's little tract. Yet the principles implied do not figure in the
government's thinking. The cabinet is preoccupied with the necessities of
survival in mid-recession. A parliamentary majority of only 21 and a sorely
divided party have emasculated it. The prime minister has '21' engraved on
his forehead.
Do not get me wrong. I think that Mr Major will sit in Downing Street for
many more years. I acknowledge his government's persistence with its
sensible education and health reforms, while regretting its inability to
think beyond the troubles on its backbenches. The rest is gloom. For we are
saddled with a government of which it must be said that the whole is less
than the sum of the parts.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Letter: Local programmes offer potential for building
ex-Soviet markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENT F MOORS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Balls' report (''Bottom-up' style in fashion for ex-Soviet
reform', January 18), suggesting that reform efforts be focused upon
ex-Soviet regions where local governments are more progressive, has
parallels with conclusions resulting from our detailed studies of western
joint venture investment in the USSR and FSU (former Soviet Union).
For the past two years, in conjunction with the American Soviet Exchange
Centre for Applied Theory and Practice at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh,
we have tracked the performance and expectations of 623 ventures. These
investments involve American, Austrian, British, French, German, Italian,
Spanish, Turkish and multinational western European participation in the
Soviet and FSU markets since February 1991.
While fewer than than 18 per cent (112) of the ventures are expected to be
profitable in the short term, almost 65 per cent of those (72) are what we
term 'Limited Local Entry Joint Ventures'.
These projects have emphasised co-operation with local/autonomous
region/republic governments prepared to support local reforms; and have
expedited protocol supports, favourable currency terms, and support with
equivalent industrial site directors and labour representatives.
Such ventures have also identified existing domestic participants in the
local markets to be served, and have minimised initial capital commitment
requirements. They have also been able to secure adequate fiduciary and
banking support because of the focused plans for entry.
There is clearly emerging sufficient evidence to indicate that combining
local government reforms with small-scale western investment programmes
intent on targeting such progressive markets may well initiate both a
positive return on funds committed and a model for broader Russian,
Ukrainian, Kazakh and Baltic market reforms 'from the bottom up'.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Letter: Threat to pits and environment from opencast mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BEN PLOWDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the debate about a possible subsidy to coal ('Rescue plans may fall
foul of EC rules', January 20) it should be noted that one of the principal
threats to deep mine production comes from the industry's own corporate
backyard, in the form of opencast coal production.
Opencast mining produced around 19m tonnes of coal in 1991, nearly one fifth
of total coal production. With around 80 per cent of opencast production
going to power generation, opencast and deep-mined coal are in direct
competition with one another.
Opencast mining is also one of the most environmentally destructive
activities currently carried out in the UK, a view endorsed by the Commons
Energy Committee in 1987. The government is currently revising its planning
guidance to local authorities which determines the basis on which opencast
planning applications are granted. In the CPRE's view this guidance is
biased in favour of the industry.
Revised guidance which reflected the environmental damage caused by
opencasting would restrict the circumstances in which planning permission
could be granted. This would quickly reduce opencast output. The securing of
a market for at least 10m-15m tonnes of deep mined coal could thus be
achieved quickly, simply and at little or no cost.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Letter: Windfall tax would not help unemployment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The proposal by the Labour party that utilities should 'pay a public
dividend (windfall tax) as a result of their excess profits' (Parliament and
Politics, January 20) to help generate jobs shows a basic misunderstanding
of the finances of the water industry.
More than 70 per cent of Wessex Water's profits are used to help fund new
capital investment programmes. Our total expenditure each year exceeds our
income by a considerable margin. Every day Wessex Water spends around Pounds
300,000 on new capital schemes to meet legally required higher standards and
to put right neglect of the past. This expenditure generates thousands of
jobs.
While wholeheartedly supporting the desire to reduce unemployment, as far as
the water industry is concerned, the Labour party's proposals would have the
opposite effect.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Public spirit, private vision: Mike Heron, new head of the
Post Office, gives Tony Jackson his views on privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mike Heron is, by his own account, a man who likes a challenge. This is
doubtless why, at 58, he has just left the company where he spent his
working life to head the Post Office, a sprawling public organisation with
some 200,000 employees and an uncertain future.
Not that Mr Heron found the decision entirely easy. 'I have to tell you,' he
says, 'that to move from one company or career to another is a highly
emotional decision. People don't just get up and do it. It's never
risk-free.'
But he had his reasons. Some months ago, he came second in the race to
succeed Sir Michael Angus as chairman of Unilever, where he had worked for
34 years. Had he got the job, he says, he could have run Unilever his own
way. It was not such a big deal when he missed it. All the same, he wanted a
complete change.
And he wanted it in the public sector. Why? The answer, he admits by
preamble, risks sounding pious. 'I have a very strong feeling that we need
to give back to society some of the things we've got from it. I'm an
absolute product of the welfare state. My father was in the Post Office - he
started behind the counter, and he ended there. I got a scholarship at the
age of 11 to a grammar school, then I went into the army and up to Oxford.
You can't ask for a better education than Oxford. And all of that was paid
for by the state.'
His sincerity here seems borne out by the record. In his six years on the
Unilever board, Mr Heron took no outside commercial directorships. But his
CV over the past decade bristles with public service appointments: in
education, hospitals, training, business in the community and so forth. It
didn't have to be the Post Office, he says. That was just what came up. 'The
important thing is for businessmen to take the science and the craft they've
got and put it into the public domain.'
What does that science consist of, exactly? 'I think a businessman or woman,
particularly in general management, is trained to focus on the raison d'etre
of the unit they're in. The discipline is to deliver. You start by gathering
a database, and you move inexorably from that to the objective you have in
mind. Normally, you're talking about the creation of wealth, the bottom
line. But the same focus could be in some other area.
'The second point is that you learn to use the resources available. You
actually value the people you're working with. Your prime resource is the
human one, and a businessman gives a lot of attention to that.'
That sounds like a personnel man speaking. Indeed, Mr Heron was Unilever's
head of personnel for his last couple of years there. But his point, he
says, is broader. 'Any successful business would ensure that its line
managers were responsible for people.'
The personnel role should be more advisory and forward-looking - visionary,
in fact. 'I was utterly determined to take over personnel at Unilever. I
believe emphatically that in the leading corporations of the world, the
management of personnel and human resources is the key activity. In my view,
the companies which will hold the high ground in a competitive world are
those with the skill and the talent.'
Presumably, this is especially true in the impoverished public sector. The
top wage in the Post Office last year - the chairman's - was Pounds 170,000.
Mr Heron concedes that pay is still a constraint in attracting outside
talent. On the other hand, there are limits to how many outsiders he wants.
'It's quite a difficult balance. If you get too many coming in, you
demotivate the others. And if you're not careful, you become short of
experience. The Post Office is a massive operation. If, for instance, you
want to put in a new style of work, you've got to cascade it down to 50,000
people. So you have to have processes to manage things, and experience of
that is very important.'
Indeed, he claims, the existing management compares very well with what he
is used to. Take, for instance, the introductory presentations he has had
from divisional chiefs and board members. 'There's less five-coloured charts
and less pirouetting around to show what a great guy the presenter is. But
the amount of information is unbelievable.'
Behind all this is a looming question. The Post Office is in the public
sector today, but it may not be for long. The government is about to decide
whether to privatise it, in whole or in part. Where does he stand on the
whole issue?
He really doesn't mind, he says. 'When you're confronted with the president
of the Board of Trade at the interview, the bald question is asked whether
you have any ideological feelings either way. My answer is, look, I'm coming
here to manage a massive business. It's your business as government to
decide ownership. My job will be to implement that.'
This is a little hard to swallow. His talk has been of goals and results. In
such an uncertain situation, how can he formulate personal goals?
Easy, he says. He has two sets: 'One is what happens if it's privatised, the
other if it isn't. If it's privatised, I think the path over the next four
years will be pretty well defined. There are certain things one has to do on
the route to privatisation: the mechanics of it, getting the team together,
getting the relationships right, and at the same time, making sure the
business is not only going well but going from strength to strength. The
challenge would be the other way - how, without privatisation, you move
upwards and outwards in terms of world class.'
That seems a pretty clear statement of preference. But another question
arises. Much of his talk has been about public service; and as he says, the
Post Office measures itself very strictly in terms of the quality of service
it provides. If it were privatised, it would be answerable to shareholders.
Where would his public service commitment be then?
His answer is a classic appeal to capitalism. In certain areas, the Post
Office is a monopoly. As such, it will be regulated whatever happens. Most
of it, though, is subject to competition. 'In a competitive world, the
concept that customer satisfaction and the shareholders are in conflict
simply isn't true. There's a dynamic tension, but a really well-run business
is full of dynamic tension - between marketing and production, between sales
and accounting. If you don't satisfy the customer, in the end you won't
satisfy the shareholder.'

FT  26 JAN 93 / Arts: 'Arte povera' of empty sculpture - William Packer
reviews 'Gravity and Grace' at the Hayward Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To look back art-historically on the critical orthodoxies of the past is
never a bad thing. This winter's exhibition at the Hayward Gallery is a
review of sculpture of a particular kind made at a particular time, the
product of the international avant-garde of some 20 years ago.
Gravity &amp; Grace recalls several polemical and controversial exhibitions of
the early 1970s, notably the 11 Los Angeles Artists of 1971, with its
portable fish farm by Newton Harrison; The New Art of 1972, that was
selected by Anne Seymour; and William Tucker's The Condition of Sculpture of
1975, all of them arranged by the Arts Council at the Hayward Gallery.
The 'Gravity' of the present exhibition's title refers specifically to the
definition offered by Tucker at that time: 'Sculpture is subject to gravity
and revealed by light. Here is the primary condition. Gravity governs
sculpture's existence in itself, light discloses sculpture to us.'
So seriously, indeed, does Jon Thompson, the organiser of this present
exercise, take the Tucker dictum, so central is it to his own debate, if
only in opposition, that he reprints Tucker's argument in his own catalogue.
'As I walked round', says Thompson, 'I recall getting more and more angry
that so many of my favourite artists were not included . . . I still believe
. . . that his position was unnecessarily astringent, and did not properly
represent a time of great diversity and change. I hope this exhibition will
serve to redress the balance.'
Is there, perhaps, the tiniest suspicion that, after all these years, he
doth protest just a shade too much? Does the old view, which Tucker chose to
recast in contemporary terms- that sculpture exists in the real world, to be
considered in its own terms and material presence in relation to human
experience- still represent such a rankling threat to the prevailing
orthodoxy? Can it really be that there is a balance still to be redressed,
from his point of view, in a critical culture that sees Damien Hirst, he of
the fly factory and the fish in formaldehyde, as the brightest of our bright
young hopes; that this year sends that tired old Duchampian, Richard
Hamilton, to represent us at Venice; that, by dint of assiduous promotion
over a generation past, has by now established Richard Long and Gilbert &amp;
George as the most famous and internationally established of living British
artists?
Thompson's selection of artists here is international, including several
American and a couple of British minimalists and conceptualists, but
weighted emphatically towards European artists, most especially those
associated with the arte povera of the late 1960s. Such 'Poor Art' was the
confection of the Italian critic, Germano Celant, who argued at the time a
political and revolutionary engagement and equivalence between art and the
various protest movements of the time.
Nowadays such over-specific intellectual encumbrances may be lightly cast
aside in favour of something more general. In Celant's view, 'poor' art
'prefers essential information', which Thompson glosses as an art 'which is
stripped of superfluous meanings. It addresses the viewers on its own terms,
without the obfuscations and mediations of existing interpretative
structures. Thus the 'poor' work is a 'transparent' work . . . it hides
nothing, it carries nothing within its interior space least of all the
psychological trappings or biography of its maker . . . it represents a
clear shifting of the focus of authority away from the artist to an
authority of interpretation invested in and by the viewer.'
So there we have it in Thompson's own words: an art for which, if he is
divested of all authority, the artist may reasonably accept no
responsibility - except, of course, from all the critical plaudits and
celebrity, the official patronage and exhibitions, and all the arte povera
trappings of conspicuous commercial success. And the 'poor' viewer is left
to make of it all just what he will, with only the intellectual blackmail to
console him: that is to say, if he can make nothing of it, although there is
avowedly nothing there, it is no fault of the artist, but of himself.
So we move into the Hayward, and there on its perch sits a resplendent blue
and red Macaw eyeing with 'transparent' scepticism the rest of the art-work
of which it is the liveliest part: the long trays planted with cacti of
'Untitled 1967' by Jannis Kounellis. There are Barry Flanagan's folded
hessian blankets, green, red and yellow, 'Pile 1', and his sacks heaped in a
corner with the light shone on them; Bruce Nauman's empty steel cage within
a marginally less empty steel cage; Joseph Beuys's row of empty
changing-room lockers; Robert Morris's nine empty fibre-glass tubes; Mario
Merz's brushwood faggots; and Richard Long's significantly early (1972)
circles of pebbles. Also here is Robert Smithson's tower of blue trays full
of rocks, with a little note and map to tell us where they were collected,
in case we wondered . . .
We have seen it all before, often, but there is nothing wrong in that. Only
the underlying assumption offends, that what is now academic should be
defended and promoted as being of the first current importance, the
persistent heresy that only what is avant-garde, soi-disant revolutionary,
can ever be truly significant. Within the broader context of the history of
art, and of the modern movement in particular, work of this kind had its
moment. It took to the limit certain ideas - derived in any case from
constructivism and Dada; conducted some useful, even necessary experiments;
and made its point as to what might be possible. That is all.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Arts: Prague Symphony plays Janacek - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Though not officially related to the BBC's recent Janacek festival at the
Barbican, the Festival Hall performance of his glorious 'Glagolitic' Mass on
Sunday came nicely in time. The visiting
Prague Symphony brought it, or rather collaborated in it with the London
Symphony Chorus (in excellent fettle, strong and precise). The solo singers,
however, were all from Eastern Europe; and the solo violinist in the other
work, the Brahms concerto, was the Russian Raphael Oleg, who won the
Tchaikovsky competition in 1986.
Martin Turnovsky, for many cruel years persona non grata with the old Czech
regime, is now Chief Conductor of the orchestra. In Brahms, their special
quality was immediately plain to hear. Unlike any Western band I can think
of, they combine a notably soft-edged attack - not quite emollient, but
never, ever pugnacious - with broad, serenely assured rhythm. Conspicuous
virtuosity is not their style, but that easy, flexible pulse bespeaks a long
tradition of collective musicianship. It was beautifully found in the
concerto, which wore a steady pristine glow. The inner orchestral voices
carolled sweetly.
In this company Oleg's taut, elegant solo line sounded a bit cool and
buttoned-up, cultivated player though he is. (I should like to know whose
cadenza he used - it was not the standard Joachim one.) Similarly almost any
Western performance of the 'Glagolitic', which has become a Western
favourite in the last decade or so, would have had more violent fortissimos
and more theatrical pianissimos than the Prague reading. Turnovsky secured
its contrasts by attentive loyalty to Janacek's instrumental writing, which
by 'normal' standards is strange - and for the strings dismayingly scratchy,
though the Prague players made it sound natural enough.
The trombone utterances were penetrating, not overbearing, and the trumpets
never shrieked. Every dramatic point nevertheless registered, without lurid
spotlights, and the breadth of the music resounded. Among the soloists,
Magdalena Hajossyova wielded a bright individual soprano (a touch of glare
toward the top helped her to cut through the band), and the Bulgarian
Verdi-tenor Kaludi Kaludov made a smooth fist of his high-lying part without
one strangulated squeak: a rare feat. In their briefer roles, the
larger-voiced mezzo Marta Benackova and bass Peter Mikulas carried the
needed weight with aplomb.
It was left to the organist Jan Hora, a Janacek performer of long
experience, to disclose the composer's wildest vein in his two solo
interludes, which he did with hell-for-leather courage. Old Janacek himself
had been an organist; the penultimate number in his
secular-pantheist-nationalist 'Mass', a frenetic eruption after the voices
have fallen silent, must represent his personal, unassuaged last word. It
sounded like that here, sealing the impression of a raw document - beyond
conventional piety or solace, but urgently addressed to his modern fellow
Czechs: 'What are we here for, what should we do?' The question itself was
put too poignantly for any answer to be sufficient.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Arts: The magic of Merce - Alastair Macaulay discusses the
American choreographer's latest works, commissioned in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merce Cunningham is an American artist, and so much of his sensibility is
profoundly American that it seems amazing that he is taken seriously
elsewhere. He is a figurehead of the New York School, of American modernism,
of abstract expressionism; and he is parent and grandparent to numerous
dance-makers who have learnt from him, broken away from him, and launched
new mini-styles of their own.
But Cunningham's two last commissions came from Europe. Last spring, the
Rambert Dance Company gave the premiere of his Touchbase. Though Cunningham
used mainly his own dancers when creating its dance material, he still has
not had his own company perform it onstage. Then, this winter, his company
presented his new Enter at the Paris Opera, which had commissioned the
premiere. A long work (60 minutes), Enter looked utterly locale-specific
(new performing-arts jargon term) - ie it made such use of the breadths,
depths and heights of the Palais Garnier stage that you wonder what on earth
it will look like anywhere else. New York will find out soon, and it will
see Touchbase too. Both will be part of the company's annual March season at
City Centre Theatre.
What was most striking about Enter at the Opera was the immense space high
above the dancers, and how powerfully the dance occupied that space,
addressed it, radiated up into it. Here are secrets, usually associated only
with ballet, but which no other choreographer today understands half so
well: how dance occupies not just the stage space in which it is performed,
how it projects not only straight out into the auditorium, but how it
acquires full scale by addressing itself to the dimensions of the whole tall
(largely empty) box of stage space. Cunningham's dancers have this scale
partly because of the pulled-up and stretched qualities of Cunningham
technique, but also thanks to his sense of dance as gesture. His dancers
seem to carry high blocks of air above them as they move, and to release
energy along multi-dimensional paths.
Cunningham knows how to makes his dancers register as individuals in a big
theatrical way, without fake heroics. What a human sense of architectural
proportion: and this sense is one reason (though only one) why he is called
a classicist.
At the same time, Enter demonstrated - more powerfully than any ballet I
have seen there - the astounding depth of the Opera stage. If there is one
passage that I and many others could never forget from the Paris
performances of this work, it would be how Cunningham has his dancers rush
downstage in a stream, one after another, and pass rapidly across the front
and off - only to reveal a male-female couple moving very, very slowly at
the back of the stage. It is as if a telescope had suddenly switched from a
racetrack to the surface of the moon. Near; then far. Blurring speed; then
hushed slowness. The contrasts - unmissable - are breathtaking.
Much of Enter's movement involved a degree of wildness, falling, fragmented
phrasing and animal attack: qualities that have interested Cunningham
increasingly in recent years. Amid this marvellous company, I must single
out Frederic Gafner for the solo, both luxuriant and paradoxical, in which
he tilts, curves and arches every which way and then suddenly bursts forth
into vivid jumps.
Cunningham himself only performed in Enter, giving himself two brief solos.
The second was jauntily inventive, but he performed it in that 'There's life
in this old buzzard yet' manner that can be so objectionable in this ageing,
once-great dance star. But in his first solo all Cunningham did was to stand
still, on three different points at the back of the stage, each time for
about a minute. Sometimes the younger dancers came and danced in front of
him, and he just stayed there impassive. Sometimes there was nothing to look
at but him. Cunningham is 73. His feet are gnarled by arthritis, his knees
and upper spine are not what they were, and his face is a web of lines. But
as he stood there, like some pillar that had been there as long as the
Palais Garnier itself, he was as wonderful to look at as an oak in winter;
or a ship's timber washed up by the tide.
A new collection of essays written on Cunningham between 1944 and 1992,
'Merce Cunningham - Dancing in Space and Time,' edited by Richard
Kostelanetz, has just been published by A Cappella Books, US, and by Dance
Books, UK. The Merce Cunningham Dance Company has its next New York season
in March. A November season at Sadler's Wells is scheduled.

<TEXT>
The most controversial programme of the evening is certainly Viewpoint 93
(ITV, 10.40) which investigates serial killers. Producer Mike Morley was
given easy access in the US and interviewed Bob Berdella, who tortured and
killed six men in Kansas, and filmed the case records of the 'Rostov
Ripper', responsible for over 50 murders in Russia. In the UK the Home
Office permitted an interview with Dennis Nilsen, who lured young men back
to his Muswell Hill flat for tea and strangulation, but then refused
permission for the footage to be screened.
For Love or Money (Channel 4, 9.00) is the first programme to cover the art
market in depth, and the fact that it does so in a jokey, ironic, style adds
to its appeal. Three incredibly successful and popular art films clutter the
schedule tonight. BBC 1 celebrates 25 years of Omnibus at 10.20 with another
screening of Ken Russell's celebration of the life and music of Frederick
Delius. This is followed by the uncut version of Don't Look Now, the
ultimate Venetian ghost story. Channel 4 hits back with the Merchant-Ivory
adaptation of EM Forster's Florentine idyll, A Room with a View. (10.00).

FT  26 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Lawyer loses sex discrimination fight
with US firm - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Nancy O'Mara Ezold, a US lawyer who successfully sued her former
employers on the grounds that she had been passed over for partnership
because of her sex, has lost her case on appeal.
The 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 1990 decision of US
district judge James McGirr Kelly against Ms Ezold's former employers, Wolf
Block Schorr and Solis-Cohen, the Philadelphia law firm. Judge Kelly had
'impermissibly substituted his own subjective judgment for that of Wolf in
determining that Ezold met the firm's partnership standards', the court
said.
The case was the first of its kind to go to trial involving a law firm. Ms
Ezold was following Ms Ann Hopkins who in 1989 had successfully sued
accountants Price Waterhouse because she was passed over for partnership
after she was evaluated by male partners as too 'macho'.
An interesting feature of the Ezold case was that instead of seeking damages
she wanted Wolf to be forced to take her back as a partner. Ms Ezold's
attorney says she will appeal.

FT  26 JAN 93 / People: Prudential appoints outside all-rounder
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prudential has broken new ground in the appointment of Lorraine Baldry,
aged 43, to be managing director of its property division, which manages the
largest property fund in the country.
In an industry largely run by male chartered surveyors, her appointment is
not only unusual in that she is a woman; she is also notable for her limited
experience of the property industry, where she has worked for just three
years.
Baldry, whose early experience was in the computer industry, is used to
having a different background from her colleagues. For five years from 1982
she was the head of the BBC's engineering computer services. She was the
most senior woman in the engineering department and one of few employees to
lack an engineering qualification.
'I have never suffered from not having the background of the organisation I
have worked for,' she says. 'IT people have to be good at learning the
business.'
Baldry, who began work as a computer programmer after leaving school, has
worked for a wide variety of organisations, ranging from her own
consultancy, which she formed in 1975, to RCA Records, where she was head of
management information services.
She says she has never needed to adapt her style to the very different
corporate cultures of these organisations. 'Power dressing is a load of
garbage. I wear suits. I wear the same style of clothes I have always worn,'
she says.
Her appointment as managing director is merely the latest in a series of
changes affecting Prudential Property Managers over recent years, since Hugh
Jenkins arrived as chief executive. The division has shed over a third of
its staff, has streamlined its management structure and is installing a new
computer system.
Her recent elevation from chief operating officer to managing director
reflects the Prudential's choice of a manager with all-round business
expertise, rather than specialist property knowledge, to head the division
of 700 people who manage five funds worth Pounds 3.7bn. Her promotion
coincides with the announcement of the departure of Christopher Edwards, a
director of PPM, who oversaw property investment matters.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Oral hearings on pension equality -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice will today begin the oral hearings in the
Coloroll Pension Trustees' equal pension rights case, along with test cases
from Germany and Holland which raise similar issues.
The court must decide whether equality is required only for pension benefits
earned by service since May 17, 1990, the date of the Barber judgment, or
for benefits which become payable after May 17, 1990, whether they were
earned by service before or after that date.
The difference in the cost of these interpretations to British pension
schemes has been estimated at Pounds 40bn.
In the Barber case the ECJ ruled that the EC equal pay rules were applicable
to pension claims, but only from the date of that judgment. In 1992, this
restriction was enshrined as a protocol in the Maastricht Treaty.
The court will also have to decide whether the equal pay requirements of the
Rome Treaty ban the use of mortality tables which reflect the differing life
expectancy of men and women. If they do, annuities, tax-free lump sums,
money-purchase benefits and transfer values will all have to be calculated
on a unisex basis. This is a requirement of the Equal Rights Amendment in
the US, but not usual in Europe.
As a measure of how important this case is to EC governments, the court will
hear submissions from 16 parties including the UK, Ireland, Holland Germany
and Denmark.
Joined Cases C-109/91, C-152/91 and C-200/91: G C Ten Oever v Stichting
Bedrijfspensioenfonds voor het Glazenwassers, January 26, 1993.
Restriction on consumer protection under the Brussels Convention
In a case involving the Brussels Convention, the European Court refused to
allow a third party to benefit from the Convention's consumer protection
rules, even though that third party was relying on rights assigned to it by
the consumer who had entered into the contract in dispute.
Under the Brussels Convention rules, consumers are entitled, exceptionally,
to bring an action in the courts in which they are domiciled - the general
convention rules being that proceedings must be brought in the jurisdiction
of the defendant's domicile.
The case before the court concerned a contract between a German judge and
the brokerage house of EF Hutton of New York to carry out certain financial
transactions on the judge's behalf. Almost all the money invested was lost.
Every order placed by the judge was initially dealt with by the brokerage's
German branch. The judge assigned his rights under the contract to a German
company. This company brought the action in question against the brokerage
house.
The court did not consider whether the original contract would have
benefited from the convention's consumer protection rules. Instead, it
restricted itself to stating that the rules in question, being exceptions
from the main principle of jurisdiction in the convention could not go
beyond what was laid down in the convention and that it was clear that the
rules were only meant to benefit those parties who were not in a position of
equality vis-a-vis their co-contracting party.
Thus, the plaintiff in this case, who was not the original consumer, could
not benefit from the special consumer protection rules.

before the national courts.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Insurers lay claim to their policies -
Robert Rice and Richard Lapper on a test case for intellectual property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On January 5, B&amp;S Underwriters, a Louisiana-based insurance company, filed a
lawsuit in the US District Court for West Louisiana that will provide the
first test of copyright protection for insurance policies.
The outcome of the case brought by B&amp;S against two US subsidiaries of Kansa
Corporation, the Finnish insurance giant, will be watched by the insurance
industry worldwide with great interest.
Victory for B&amp;S could produce a torrent of litigation in the US as insurance
companies seek to enforce intellectual property rights over insurance
products that they have taken out with increasing frequency over the past
decade in the struggle to gain competitive advantage in the multi-billion
dollar US insurance market.
According to B&amp;S's lawyer, Mr Peter Trzyna of the Chicago law firm Keck,
Mahin &amp; Cate, 10 years ago there were less than 300 federally registered
trademarks approved for insurance in the US. Today there are more than
1,200. There has been a similar rise in the number of copyright protections.
From 1978 to 1981 there were only 1,500 copyright registrations relating to
insurance forms; today there are more than 10,700. Some companies have also
successfully obtained patent protection for computer support systems for
insurance products and services.
The driving force behind this trend is increased competition in the
industry, he says. Insurance companies can no longer afford to spend
millions of dollars developing and launching new products only to have them
copied by competitors and sold against their own products in the
marketplace.
The increased willingness of US courts to recognise intellectual property
rights over financial products, combined with a new awareness among
insurance companies that intellectual property law provides a powerful tool
for protecting their innovative ideas and products will have a profound
impact on the insurance industry, he predicts.
Those who infringe intellectual property rights risk destruction of all
their infringing policies and damages running into millions of dollars.
The increase in the number of insurance companies seeking intellectual
property protection for their new products dates from the passing of the
1976 US Copyright Act. According to Mr Trzyna, before the Act came into
force the courts proved very reluctant to uphold copyright protection for
insurance forms.
A number of insurance companies with copyrighted insurance forms sued
companies that had allegedly copied their products and lost. The US courts
adopted the doctrine that where an underlying idea could only be conveyed in
a more or less stereotyped manner, duplicating it did not constitute
copyright infringement even if there was word-for-word copying.
Since the 1976 Act was passed, however, beefing up federal copyright law,
there have been several cases where courts have found infringements of
copyright in relation to other financial products.
In 1982, in a case brought by Dow Jones, a court ruled that a list of stocks
in an index was protected by copyright. In 1985 Merritt Forbes, a securities
underwriter and marketer which had registered a copyright for its reoffering
circulars and supplements for tax-exempt municipal bonds, successfully sued
Newman Investment Securities and others for infringing the copyright by
using substantially copied documents in an offering.
To date, however, no court in the US has found an infringement of
copyrighted insurance forms.
The B&amp;S case involves an innovation in US workers' compensation insurance
which B&amp;S claims to have pioneered by splitting a standard policy into two,
allowing companies, such as life, accident and health insurance groups, not
previously involved with workers compensation, to provide cover.
B&amp;S registered copyrights for essentially every public document covering the
innovation, including its policies, underwriting guidelines, advertising and
even its filings with the state insurance commissioners.
In addition it has six pending applications to register service marks used
in connection with the product and it has filed a patent application for a
computer system used to support the product and methods for making and using
it.
B&amp;S is not alone in combining intellectual property protections in this way
to safeguard insurance innovations. The Chubb Corporation and its
subsidiaries has at least one patent, 44 federal and 29 state trademark
registrations and 150 copyright registrations. Lincoln National Insurance
has one patent, 58 federal and 35 state trademark registrations and 89
registered copyrights.
'It took a great deal of effort and expense to create and launch our
innovation and shepherd it through state regulators,' says Mr William Wolfe
of B&amp;S. 'Like those in other industries, we have used intellectual property
protections to safeguard our innovation and we have licensed the rights to
market it. All we want is protection from those who would otherwise use our
work without incurring the expense and risk of pioneering a new product.'
The complaint against the Kansa subsidiaries, Clarendon National Insurance
Company and Sterling Investors Life Insurance, is that, having entered into
discussions with B&amp;S about the possibility of selling, in Louisiana, a
standard workers' compensation policy that would complement the B&amp;S product,
and having induced B&amp;S to reveal confidential information about its new
product, Clarendon broke off negotiations and teamed up with Sterling to
market competing policies based on B&amp;S's trade secrets and in breach of the
B&amp;S copyrights.
B&amp;S are claiming an injunction to prevent Clarendon and Sterling marketing
their competing products, and are seeking destruction of all infringing
policies, triple damages for wilful infringement and recovery of any profits
resulting from the misappropriation of the B&amp;S product.
According to another Keck partner, Mr Bruce Foudree, industry leaders will
be watching this test case very closely. 'To promote creativity and
innovation in the insurance industry, those who bring new products to the
market must be protected,' he says.
But judging by their reaction to news of the case, insurers in the London
market are not expecting the controversy to spill over into either the UK
market or the London market, a focus for much of the world's commercial
insurance and reinsurance industry and traditionally a centre of innovation.
'It seems very odd. When we launch a new policy we assume it has a shelf
life of only a few weeks,' said a spokesman for one of the large
Anglo-American insurance brokers based in London.
'We assume we have six months before everybody else catches up.'
Mr Alistair Gillies, a partner at City law firm Elborne Mitchell which
specialises in insurance law, said there would be difficulties in asserting
copyright over an insurance policy wording.
'As far as I am aware no one has ever tried to do it in the UK. It would be
unlikely to happen here because of the difficulties in proving a wording was
unique,' he said.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Technology: How to manage ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having a good idea is one thing. Making it work commercially is quite
another. Among big multinational companies, the awareness of the importance
of managing technology is well developed, but its practice still causes
plenty of headaches.
Nearly 90 per cent of executives at multinationals think their businesses
need some form of education in this area.
Their concerns centre on the strategic incorporation of technology in
business, the shortening of product development lifecycles and the speedier
adoption or abandonment of technologies.
The findings come from a survey by Decision Resources (a former affiliate of
Arthur D. Little, the US consultancy), Management Centre Europe and American
Management Association International. It was carried out among 120
executives of multinationals, based mostly in Europe and the US, at a
seminar in Boston.
The main obstacle to the proper management of technology is an emphasis on
short-term thinking, followed by internal competition over priorities, the
need to justify new technologies financially and lack of communication.
Most executives believe a clearer definition of short- and long-term goals
would help. Other solutions include placing higher priorities on the
development of technology, and improved communications. Almost all say their
company has taken steps to pay more heed to technology management.
Among these are: sponsoring staff education programmes; creating a senior
position for technology management; and decentralising research and
development. Innovation is not enough; commercial exploitation is just as
important. As John Kay, economics professor at the London Business School,
said last week: 'The real difficulty lies in turning innovation into
competitive advantage.'

FT  26 JAN 93 / Technology: Silencing the kitchen gadgets - Della Bradshaw
reports on the battle to stamp out electro-magnetic interference from the
airways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blanche Cosgrove's Christmas decorations should have been above suspicion.
But when police in her home town of Lancaster, Pennsylvania found the only
sound they could pick up on their police radios was 'Jingle Bells', the
Cosgrove household fell under scrutiny.
There, investigators found a musical ornament decorated with three plastic
reindeer with illuminated noses. Unknown to Cosgrove, the decoration had
emitted a signal on the police radio frequency and the signal was amplified
by a local radio repeater antenna.
Fortunately, the police department found the incident amusing rather than
criminal. But, says Stephen Kirk, managing director of Radio Frequency
Investigation, which tests equipment for electro-magnetic noise, it vividly
demonstrates how emissions from the smallest electrical or electronic gadget
can interfere with important equipment, often causing serious problems and
even threatening lives. 'People often think that because a product is small
or cheap it won't cause interference, but it does,' he says.
Most of the time, electro-magnetic interference is an irritant - for
example, causing the 'snow' on television screens when an old-fashioned
electric drill is used - rather than a killer. The catalogue of actual
disasters caused by such interference is slim: disrupted railway signalling,
satellites veering off course and manic Japanese robots killing factory
workers are well-worn examples. During the 1991 Gulf conflict, interference
also caused an electronically-controlled missile to fire accidently.
But as the number of electronic gadgets increases, from the latest mobile
phone to the whizziest food mixer, so does the potential for disaster. And
on a commercial level, as computer systems proliferate, so does the
potential for computer discs to be corrupted and data destroyed.
In a European-wide move to cut down this electronic smog, the European
Community has issued regulations regarding electro-magnetic interference.
These say that from January 1 1996, all manufacturers and users of
electrical or electronic equipment will have to ensure that their equipment
does not interfere with other machines, nor is it susceptible to
interference. The penalty for non-compliance is a fine or even a prison
sentence.
But the impending regulations have Britain's smaller companies up in arms.
They say they cannot afford to comply with the new regulations.
Systek Controls, for example, finds itself in a dilemma faced by many small
electronics companies. It employs nine people and makes control systems for
machinery as diverse as food processing plant and machine tools. 'Basically
our customer would have a machine which was 20 or 30 years old but was
mechanically sound. However, it would need a new electric control system.
The company would come to us for that,' explains managing director Robert
Bent.
As a result, most of the pieces of equipment Systek makes are one-off
designs, ranging in price from between Pounds 800 and Pounds 30,000. Testing
each piece of equipment to ensure that it complied with the regulations
would cost at least Pounds 3,000 - in many cases more than the equipment
costs today to buy. And that assumes the equipment passes the test the first
time.
To head off criticism, the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK has
issued a document for smaller companies offering a cheaper option -
self-certification. Companies choosing this route only have to say they
believe their equipment complies with the standards.
Bent believes even this is a headache: 'We ought to be able to self-certify
 -but can we? One of our biggest problems is finding out what we can and
can't do. It has to involve extra work and one of our shortest resources is
time.'
Others are not so charitable. Colman Twohig, who runs his own company,
Twohig Electric Services, describes the self-certification route as
'ridiculous' in law. 'Why have a law and then say that you're allowed to
break it if you can't afford to comply with it?'
He likens it to Britain's MOT test for older cars. What would happen, he
asks, if car owners who could not afford to test their cars were allowed to
bypass the procedure by stating simply that they believed the car to be
road-worthy?
After 1996 - when the self-certified equipment is in use - Twohig believes a
small company would have no defence in the case of a prosecution if found to
have breached the rules.
Kirk argues that companies can minimise such risks by ensuring good design
practice and by doing partial testing on component parts which appear in all
their products. Victor Clements, sales and marketing director of
Interference Technology International, of Swindon, believes another way of
cutting costs is to take out a technical file on a family of products, which
could be done for as little as Pounds 1,000, and claim compliance of other
products on the grounds of similarity.
It is all a question of risk analysis, argues Kirk. For a company which
produces just one piece of equipment, there is little chance of interference
and therefore self-certification is appropriate.
A company which produces thousands of television sets, on the other hand,
would be in far greater danger of polluting the airwaves and therefore
should do more thorough testing, both before and during production.
Twohig, however, believes that testing is the only route to ensure
compliance. And, he says, the best solution would be for the DTI to give
grants to smaller companies to subsidise testing. But the DTI has ruled out
such a scheme.
John Redfern, of another one-man company, JR Engineering, also believes
testing should be the rule, but that certain categories of equipment should
be declared exempt. These would include prototypes and small production
runs. A good rule, he says, would be to say that if the cost of testing were
more than one-tenth of the revenue from the product family then the
equipment should be exempt.
The self-certification scheme could also undermine one of the big bonuses
put forward for electro-magnetic testing - that testing would guarantee the
quality of the product. Equipment which has undergone testing will
automatically bear the 'CE' sticker - a sign that the product meets the
required European standard.
'Companies look at the CE mark as a mark of quality, particularly in the Far
East,' points out Clements.
Now the DTI has confirmed that companies that opt for self-certification
will also be able to use the CE sticker. 'That means the CE mark means
absolutely nothing,' concludes Redfern.
Twohig, Redfern and Bent are not the only ones concerned about the problems
for small companies. The UK-circulated Electronics Weekly magazine has
initiated a campaign asking smaller companies to get in touch if they have
similar problems.
In the month the campaign has been running nearly 100 people have aired
their grievances. 'There is a ground swell of concern among small
electronics companies,' says assistant editor Paul Gregg. He says trade
magazines in France and Germany have noted a similar swell of complaints
there.
Critics of small businesses say it is the companies' own fault and that they
should have heeded DTI warnings over the past years that the regulations
were about to be introduced. Clements, for example, points out that his
company has done more work for US companies, wanting to sell into Europe,
than for British ones.
Kirk is more sympathetic. He believes the economic climate has done little
to encourage small companies to look into the the issues of electro-magnetic
compatibility: 'If you're not sure that you're going to be around in a
year's time then you're not going to worry about rules which will come into
effect in four years, are you?'

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do the phrases 'recognising speech' and 'wrecking a nice beach' have in
common? Nothing, is the obvious answer. Yet both phrases are acoustically
identical. So how can a smart computer (which can hear and speak) spot the
difference?
Computer researchers involved in speech translation technology face this
question every day. But they are making progress, as an experiment is
designed to show this week in Munich.
It will link three sites in the US, Germany and Japan by telephone and allow
conversations to be simultaneously translated by using speech synthesisers,
computers and digital telephone signals.
Conversations cannot carry more than 600 pre-defined words and must be
continuous and flawless. But the system is speaker-independent - it can
recognise any voice, regardless of intonation and accent.
'Within the last year or so, such technology has become less of a utopian
dream. We are moving into practical uses,' says Alexander Waibel, a
professor at Germany's Karlsruhe University who, with colleagues from
Carnegie Mellon University in the US and the Advanced Telecommunications
Research Institute International of Japan, is conducting the experiment.
The results stem from a decade of research in which other companies have
also been active. AT&amp;T, the US telephone group, presented at last year's
Seville World Fair a system which translates some 200 words but remains
speaker-dependent. Nippon Electric Corporation also funds such research.
Recent progress in the field has attracted the interest of Germany's
Siemens, which partially funds Karlsruhe's work. But most funds are from the
state. The German government is spending DM13m (Pounds 5.3m) annually over
eight years. ATR enjoys funding from Japan's Post and Telecommunication
Ministry.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Staying one step ahead of
the pack - Charles Batchelor looks at tips on how to handle the sale of your
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once the economy starts to come out of recession there will be owners of
private businesses whose thoughts turn to selling their company.
Acquisitions of private companies are expected to increase in 1993,
according to one recent survey.
But if you are contemplating the sale of your business you must adopt a
professional approach, warns Geoffrey Dalton in What is Your Business
Worth?*
You will probably only sell one business in your life so you will not have
the opportunity to refine your sales techniques. The skills you learned in,
for example, marketing heating systems are unlikely to be of any help, he
notes.
Yet there is a good chance you will be up against a professional buyer or
buying team. Many public companies have assembled formidable merger and
acquisition teams who have probably bought six businesses already in the
past year.
'Their pace, systematic approach, assurance, presentation and, indeed,
bonhomie are awe-inspiring,' writes Dalton. 'For them this is just another
day and just another deal. For you, in contrast, it is an emotional parting
of the ways.'
The buyer's approach may start with an offer which you cannot sensibly
refuse. You will be encouraged to think of how you might spend the money and
urged to sit back while he does all the hard work.
Once you are hooked the would-be buyer will ask for additional information -
on markets, pricing, costings, products. It will obviously be necessary for
the buyer's team to meet your key employees and before you know where you
are your whole team is dedicated to producing reams of information, all of
which must be checked and cross-checked.
Soon you start to accept the fact that the sale is all but sewn up. Your
employees begin to realign their loyalties and imagine their vastly enhanced
career prospects under the new owner.
At this point, when everyone is aboard, the squeeze starts. The buying team
discover, to their surprise, that there is more slow-moving stock then they
first thought, there are doubtful debts and they will need to invest more
capital than originally envisaged.
You begin to convince yourself that they are doing you a favour by taking
the company off your hands. It is logical, therefore, in deference to their
own shareholders, that they cannot continue with their original offer.
At this point you are exhausted, your staff's loyalties are divided, your
sales drive has faltered because everyone has been busy with the
negotiations. Legal and accountancy fees are mounting.
How did this happen? You realise you were so dazzled with the initial offer
that you did not approach other potential buyers or challenge the original
bidder's assumptions. You allowed it to become a one-horse race.
The scenario may appear exaggerated but this type of conduct is not at all
unusual, says Dalton. To avoid it arising business owners must decide their
own objectives and priorities.
They must establish a target price and an acceptable minimum price; decide
the form and timing of the payment; consider whether they are willing to
remain involved in the business after the sale; and decide which assets are
to be included in the sale.
Most owners of a private company have only a very hazy idea of what it is
worth, often based on golf club locker room gossip or comparisons with the
prices achieved by completely dissimilar businesses sold in a very different
economic climate.
Obtaining a realistic valuation will not only help the owner to be prepared
for a bid approach but will show whether the business is making an
acceptable return. One family-owned business run by a delegated management
team was paying a dividend of Pounds 40,000 a year, a fraction of the Pounds
300,000-Pounds 400,000 the shareholders could have earned from a similar
investment in government securities, Dalton notes.
Ultimately, the value of your company depends on what a buyer is willing to
pay. A 'jigsaw buyer' who is assembling a national network and needs your
business to complete the picture, is likely to offer the best price. But you
cannot value your business on this basis. You will have to calculate your
value to a predictable buyer.
If you are considering selling your company you may need to make changes
well in advance. If the business is too dependent on your daily presence it
may have little value to another owner once you have sold out. You may need
to delegate more to managers and offer them equity.
You may also need to reduce the amounts you take out of the business to
enable investments and improvements to be made with the increased retained
profits. If your accounting procedures have been designed to minimise
profits you may need to adjust them. You will need to do this well in
advance. A sudden adjustment which shows a sharp uplift in value will make
buyers suspicious.
Where do you turn for advice on valuations and on handling a sale? Dalton, a
specialist in the purchase and sale of unquoted companies, is not
surprisingly sceptical of the skills of non-experts. Among these he includes
the smaller accountancy firms, the family solicitor and the bank manager.
Unless they handle a large number of deals, they will not have the
specialist skills required and may well learn at your expense, he warns.
A survey by the Imperial College Management School in London showed that
most vendors do not use any outside adviser and while accountants are the
most common source of help even the large firms handle relatively few deals
each. This lively guide meets a clear need.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Keep the scissors out -
Cutting red tape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK Prime Minister John Major is stepping up his campaign to reduce red tape
with the announcement of a cabinet seminar next week, to force ministers to
produce plans for action. But as the company featured here illustrates,
well-intentioned bureaucrats have planted a fearsome thicket of regulation
around business.
The Growing Business Page will highlight over the next few months businesses
entrapped by red tape. It will award a bottle of Laurent-Perrier pink
champagne to each one featured.
The owner-managers of independent businesses are invited to describe their
experiences - on no more than two sides of A4 please.
Letters should be addressed to Charles Batchelor, Growing Business
Correspondent, Financial Times, Number One, Southwark Bridge, London SE1
9HL.
AFTER 22 years in business, Bud Ellis, managing director of Flexi-pak - a
manufacturer of individual portions of jams and sauces - decided to take out
liability insurance for himself and his two fellow directors. The growing
weight of legislation affecting companies, particularly those in the food
sector, and the penalties attached, persuaded Ellis, reluctantly, to act. He
is now resigned to paying an annual premium of Pounds 2,625 to cover
himself, his wife Ann, and sales director James Puttick.
'I came back after Christmas and decided that we had to bite the bullet,'
says Ellis. 'We are very insurance-minded but this was a chink in our
armour. We will have to sell a lot of extra sauce and jam to cover the extra
overhead.' Taken in isolation, an insurance premium of Pounds 2,500 is not a
large sum even for a company the size of Flexi-pak. The New Milton,
Hampshire-based business has sales of Pounds 1.3m and employs 12 people,
including the three directors. But it comes on top of a growing raft of
other burdens which absorb time and money.
New waste control legislation (designed to reduce fly-tipping), which came
into effect last April, means Ellis has had to fill in a form from the
company which removes his refuse describing what sort of waste his company
produces.
This legislation simply involved Ellis in filling in a few boxes on a form,
but the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health legislation has involved
much more work. Ann Ellis, who deals with most of the red tape, says the
directors had assumed COSHH applied only to the products they package.
But while she was talking to the environmental health officer about another
matter the conversation turned to COSHH. 'He picked up a bottle of Tipp-Ex
corrector fluid and said that if we used it we were covered by the
legislation.' This has led to Ann Ellis compiling a list of 35 potentially
harmful products, their contents, application, manufacturer's reference
number and possible effects.
The products involved include a spray glue, marker pens, Jif cleaner, Brillo
pads, disinfectants, de-icer, paints and methylated spirits. In some
instances Ellis had to write to the manufacturer to obtain the information
needed for her files. 'This is an insult to our intelligence,' says Bud
Ellis.
The Food Safety Act, which came into force in January 1991, does apply to
the products Flexi-pak makes. To comply the company has drawn up a detailed
product specification and a description of the procedures the company
follows to maintain food hygiene. The Worcester Sauce entry runs to three
pages. 'We have spent hours on this,' says Bud Ellis. 'Customers we have
dealt with for years have been on to us for extra information. I am not
saying we should not do this but it all leads to extra work.'
Extra work - and cost - are also involved in the Electricity at Work
regulations. This requires businesses to maintain electrical equipment and
wiring in a safe condition.
Ellis has asked his electrician to produce a register of electrical
equipment and to carry out annual inspections. But he is not convinced of
the need. 'We have had no problems with our electrical equipment in 22
years,' he says.
Ann Ellis's bulging files have recently been joined by a packet of leaflets
on the changes to the VAT rules brought about by the creation of the single
European market. Under the rules Flexi-pak will be responsible for collating
its own VAT data and filing trade information to Customs &amp; Excise.
Because the company imports more than Pounds 135,000 in goods, it will be
required to fill out a more detailed monthly form.
Administering the VAT system has already caught the company out once. The
company reclaimed VAT twice on the same invoice of nearly Pounds 4,000. This
error happened when it was moving its records from one computer to another
but was picked up during a VAT audit 18 months later. Last July Customs
imposed a serious misdeclaration penalty which, with interest charges,
amounted to Pounds 1,000.
Bud Ellis says the double claim was a genuine mistake, the first significant
VAT error the company had made, and feels Customs' response labelled him and
his fellow directors criminals. Resentment of the serious misdeclaration
penalty is widespread and pressure from business has led to a reduction in
the severity of penalties and review of its workings.
The continual accretion of new legislation and the growing number of laws
which can lead to directors facing criminal charges is a source of
considerable concern to many small businesses. 'Government is pillorying
responsible people instead of getting to grips with the real criminals,'
comments Bud Ellis. 'We are the soft touch.'
The Health &amp; Safety Executive said that products covered by the COSSH
regulations could be dangerous in certain situations. Solvents used to make,
for example, corrector fluid, are also used in adhesives. In sufficient
quantity in enclosed areas, these have led to deaths.

FT  26 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets lifted by rise in
oils, bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
RISING oil stocks and a buoyant bond market gave US stock markets a big lift
yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 35.39 at 3,292.20,
close to its high for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's
500 finished 3.91 higher at 440.02, while the Amex composite ended up 3.16
at 409.52, and the Nasdaq composite 5.32 firmer at 706.95, another record
close. Trading volume on the NYSE was 289m shares.
There were two distinct factors behind the market's gains. First, oil stocks
were in strong demand on news that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is close to agreeing to a Saudi Arabian proposal to cut production
by up to 1m barrels a day.
Second, equity investors were buoyed by further gains in bond prices. The
benchmark 30-year government bond jumped more than a full point, sending the
yield down to below 7.2 per cent for the first time in more than five years.
Ironically, the bond market's advance was prompted by comments over the
weekend by treasury secretary Mr Lloyd Bentsen on taxation policy that would
normally have been bad news for stocks - he cast doubt on whether the new
administration would cut taxes paid by the middle classes, and talked of the
possible introduction of energy and consumption taxes.
Equity investors, however, chose to ignore the tax issue, and concentrated
instead on the latest decline in bond market rates, which they hope will
provide fresh fuel for the slowly recovering economy.
Oil stocks were ablaze, not just because of the Opec news but also because
of strong quarterly earnings from a number of big companies. Texaco rose
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 60 1/4 , Exxon added Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 60
5/8 , British Petroleum rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 44 3/8 , Chevron
firmed Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 , and Royal Dutch Petroleum gained
Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 81 5/8 .
Airline stocks, however, were lower on the news of possible Opec production
cuts, because they would push up the cost of aviation fuel. AMR, parent of
American Airlines, fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 64 3/8 , Delta dropped
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 51 3/8 , and UAL slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 122
1/2 .
Sears rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 50 5/8 in busy trading after the company
announced plans to close its catalogue business and discard about 150 retail
outlets, with the loss of 16,000 jobs. Sears is taking a Dollars 1.7bn
after-tax charge to cover the changes, investors welcomed the measures.
General Motors class E shares, which represent the company's Electronic Data
Systems (EDS) subsidiary, rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 35 3/8 on
speculation that BT, the UK telecommunications group, is ready to buy a
large stake in EDS.
On the Nasdaq market, leading technology stocks were mixed, with Intel up
Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 112 3/4 but Microsoft down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars
88 1/2 .
Canada
Toronto share prices ended higher in active trading. The composite index
rose 19.67 points, or 0.60 per cent, to close at 3295.64. Advancing issues
led declines by 336 to 277. Volume of 39,740,000 shares was off from
44,816,000 shares on Friday, and trading value was CDollars 361.5m against
CDollars 408m.

FT  26 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo stocks weaken
slightly on arbitrage selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices moved within a narrow range on small-lot selling, and the
Nikkei average closed moderately lower as public fund buying gave way to
arbitrage selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index closed down 49.36 to 16,287.45, moving between a low of
16,266.78 and a high of 16,374.94. Selling by corporate investors and
arbitrageurs finally overcame small-lot public buying.
Volume fell to 170m shares from 190m as most investors remained on the
sidelines. Losers led gainers by 617 to 305 with 178 issues remaining
unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 6.64 to 1,250.06 and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.82 to 1,018.80.
Most market participants remained inactive during the Bank of Japan branch
managers' two-day meeting which started yesterday.
The BoJ will assess the present state of the country's regional businesses
in the meeting, and market participants hope some comments over a widely
expected monetary easing will be made.
Individual investors sold speculative theme stocks on concerns about a
mounting overhang of margin positions. Many investors, who sought theme
stocks in September, face margin settlements in March. Green Cross, the
pharmaceutical company which was popular on the 'Aids theme', was the most
active issue of the day, falling Y40 to Y1,130, while Meiji Milk Products
lost Y26 to Y800.
Other pharmaceutical issues were also dragged down, with Takeda Chemical
down Y10 to Y1,240 and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical falling Y30 to Y2,420.
Sony rallied on small-lot buying in the morning session on reports that it
would increase production of the mini-disc, its next-generation audio
system, due to increased demand. However, Sony finally closed down Y20 at
Y4,090 on profit-taking. Pioneer Electronic, which lost ground last week on
reports of a downwards revision of earnings by a local broker, fell a
further Y20 to Y2,350.
Other high-technology issues declined on selling by tokkin, or specified
money trusts. Hitachi retreated Y12 to Y693, falling below Y700 for the
first time since November last year. NEC fell Y21 to Y610 on earnings
concerns as the company plans to join the low price personal computer
market, competing against US companies.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 131.33 to 17,760.05 in volume of 30m shares.
Nintendo, the game maker, gained Y100 to Y10,400.
Roundup
HONG Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were closed for the Chinese New Year
holiday.
AUSTRALIAN shares gave up strong gains to end a quiet day marginally higher.
Futures trading led the market downwards after the All Ordinaries index hit
a peak of 1,531.9. The index finished 0.4 higher on the day at 1,523.4.
Westpac received a favourable market response to its appointment of US
banker Robert Joss as managing director. Its shares touched ADollars 2.98
shortly before noon but then sank in line with the index, closing 1 cent
lower at ADollars 2.89 in turnover of 3.4m shares.
Significant afternoon options trade was thought to be the result of Mr Kerry
Packer rolling over more of his Westpac options.
BHP closed steady at ADollars 13.22 off a high of ADollars 13.36, while CRA
ended up 6 cents higher at ADollars 12.80 after reaching ADollars 12.96.
Turnover reached 107.11m shares worth ADollars 186.66m.
Arnotts which said it was considering a share buyback offer, but only after
the ADollars 9.50 per share takeover offer from Campbell Soup closes on
Thursday, ended 2 cents down at ADollars 9.50.
BANGKOK out-performed expectations and the SET index rose 18.74 to 998.44,
having briefly topped the 1,000 level, with turnover a high Bt12.1bn.
NEW ZEALAND shares posted modest gains in thin trading in a market held back
by the Wellington Anniversary Day holiday in the capital.
Brierley lifted 3 cents to NZDollars 1.04 and Carter Holt Harvey, 5 cents to
Dollars 2.68. Telecom fell 2 cents to Dollars 2.33.
The NZSE-40 index closed up 4.85 to 1,503.28.
SEOUL fluctuated narrowly in a day of healthy trading which saw the
composite index break through the 700-level to end 7.69 higher at 707.61.
The firm trend emerged in response to the news that South Korea would
shortly reduce interest rates, including the central bank's rediscount rate,
by 1-2 percentage points.
MANILA saw a three-day rally end with a fall of 1.33 in the composite index
to 1,340.14.

FT  26 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Chemicals sector depresses
continental trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE continent reacted to forecasts of lower earnings by chemical and
pharmaceutical groups, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT fell on sharp declines in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors
after reports of brokers downgrades and lower than expected January drug
sales. Activity was also depressed by the weaker dollar which affected
export-sensitive stocks and the breakdown at the weekend in pay talks
between the government and public sector union.
The DAX index closed 18.4 lower at 1,569.24 after a day's high of 1,582.21
as turnover fell to DM4.3bn from Friday's DM5.7bn.
Schering, down DM12.50 at DM703.50, continued to weaken as concern over its
agrochemicals division surfaced again, while Basf lost DM2.50 to DM212.20,
Bayer fell DM3.00 to DM269.30 and Hoechst shed DM4.00 to DM252.30. Some
analysts said that defensive stocks were losing ground as investors turned
to cyclicals in anticipation of economic recovery next year.
BMW declined DM15.30 to DM501.50 after forecasting lower car sales and
warning that earnings would remain weak. Elsewhere in the sector Volkswagen
sliped DM4.70 to DM273.00 while Daimler was DM3.80 lower at DM572.70.
PARIS was depressed after rumours that a cut in domestic interest rates was
imminent proved unfounded. The CAC-40 index, which had earlier seen a day's
high of 1,813.86, fell back to close down 40.50 or 2.2 per cent at 1,779.90
in turnover of some FFr2bn.
Concern about 1992 earnings from Elf, due to be released today and expected
to show up to a 40 per cent decline in net profit, also weighed on the
market. Its shares fell FFr16.50 or 4.8 per cent to FFr324.30.
St Gobain lost all of Friday's gains, down FFr14.90 to FFr481.00 while
Paribas, which reports provisional 1992 figures later in the week was down
FFr12.50 at FFr373.50.
ZURICH finished a moderately active session easier but above the day's low.
The SMI index finished down 17.3 at 2,085.4.
Pharmaceuticals were under pressure: Ciba-Geigy registered shares, SFr3
lower at SFr653, topped the active list while Roche certificates, down SFr30
at SFr4,090, were second.
The weak dollar put some selling pressure on cement producer Holderbank,
SFr6 easier at SFr552 and on Alusuisse, SFr7 lower at SFr453. Nestle bearers
and registered shares fell SFr10 and SFr15 to SFr1,080 and SFr1,075
respectively ahead of preliminary information on its 1992 results due today.
SMH, SFr80 lower at SFr1,485, weakened after a weekend newspaper said its
project to make an ecological car, from which Volkswagen has withdrawn, was
unlikely to succeed and this could hamper sales of the Swatch watch.
AMSTERDAM saw chemicals weaken in line with the trend elsewhere in the
continent and the CBS Tendency index closed down 0.9 at 98.0.
Daf was suspended at Fl 7.20 ahead of the announcement by the group later
today of restructuring plans. The market is expecting state aid from the
Dutch and Belgium government in conjunction with further staff cuts.
Among the fallers DSM lost Fl 2.40 to Fl 76.00, Akzo Fl 1.30 to Fl 135.70
and Ahold Fl 1.20 to Fl 87.40.
MILAN retreated, with the market taking its lead from falls in Montedison
and Credito Italiano. The Comit index shed 9.53 to 472.09.
Montedison fell L61 to L1,216, on reports it might have to pay state energy
holding ENI L800bn to settle a dispute over a joint venture which ended
several years ago.
Credito Italiano fell sharply on reports that it would not be privatised,
and failed to recover much when the reports were denied by IRI, its parent
company, and Merrill Lynch, which has been appointed by IRI to study the
sale of IRI's 67 per cent stake.
Credito's shares were fixed L97 lower at L2,978 but struggled back to L3,000
in after-hours trading.
Pirelli dipped L9 to L1,189 as it agreed to sell its STL Superga clothing
and footwear unit to a subsidiary of Sopaf, an Italian financial group, for
L103bn, realising a L70bn book profit on the operation.
Gemina fell L80 to L1,205 as speculation subsided that the company might be
considering the sale of its stake in paper producer Burgo.
Fiat tended L45 easier to L4,286 ahead of preliminary figures on Thursday.
STOCKHOLM was broadly lower in heavy trading, led down by a decline as
foreign investors sold holdings in Astra. The Affarsvarlden index declined
20.5 to 892.4.
After reaching an all-time high at the beginning of the year at SKr765 for
Astra A shares, the issue closed SKr20 lower at SKr674, while the B
counterpart dropped to SKr18 to SKr661.
Astra's fall followed reports of analysts' profits downgradings and also
reflects a worldwide trend away from pharmaceutical shares due to fears of
price regulation, particularly in the US.
VIENNA was easier with the ATX index down 2.78 at 728.19.
OMV shares fell Sch6 to Sch593 on last week's announcement of a dividend
cut.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar remains under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR fell nearly two pfennigs against the D-Mark in European trading
yesterday as dealers continued to revise forecasts for likely changes in
short-term German and US interest rates this year, writes James Blitz.
After closing in London at DM1.5900 on Friday night, the US currency tumbled
to a low of DM1.5690, before closing at DM1.5725, some 1.75 pfennigs down on
the day. That close put it more than 7 pfennigs lower than its levels in the
first week of this year.
Recently, the market has become more pessimistic about how quickly US and
German rates will converge, a factor which continues to underpin the D-Mark.
At the start of the year, interest rate futures markets appeared to think
that the gap between German and US rates would come down by 350 basis points
by the end of the year. Last night they were discounting a narrowing of the
order of 280 basis points.
The last two days, in particular, have brought several indications that US
interest rates will remain low and German rates high.
Dealers voiced concern yesterday that weekend talks between German trade
unions and the Bonn government had broken down, fuelling fears that German
wage inflation would continue to climb.
Yesterday's 1.0 percentage point monthly rise in December's rate of
inflation in North-Rhine Westphalia also appears to have depressed some
investors, raising fears that the Bundesbank will find it difficult to ease
policy as quickly as expected. Mr Avinash Persaud, currency economist at UBS
Phillips and Drew in London, believes that the upshot of the breakdown in
wage talks is that the Bundesbank will not ease policy at its next meeting
on February 4, as some have suggested.
There are also growing indications that the Federal Reserve will not raise
short-term interest rates as quickly as expected, either.
At the weekend, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new US Treasury secretary, said that
Mr Bill Clinton's administration was likely to propose increased taxes on
consumption. This quashed expectations that the administration is determined
to introduce a fiscal stimulus which would have to be accompanied by higher
US interest rates.
One sign of the new strength of the exchange rate mechanism was the absence
of pressures in Europe despite the D-Mark's strength against the US
currency.
The French franc lost a little ground against the D-Mark, closing at
FFr3.385 to the D-Mark from a previous close of FFr3.386. The Irish
authorities were also able to cut their secured advances rate from 15 per
cent to 14 per cent.
Sterling consolidated against the D-Mark following last week's sharp fall.
It closed at DM2.4525 up 1 1/4 pfennigs in the day, helped by a report from
the CBI on business confidence.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Franc futures tumble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH FRANC futures suffered a dramatic fall yesterday, as dealers started
to believe that Germany and France would not ease policy as quickly as had
been expected, writes James Blitz.
The prospects for an immediate and sharp easing in short-term German rates
seemed a little more distant yesterday morning, after two weeks of optimism,
and this was reflected in higher cash rates for French francs.
There were several reasons for bearishness in France. First, the Bank of
France kept its officially posted short-term money rates unchanged at its
weekly Monday intervention.
There had been strong speculation about an easing, now that the French franc
is under less pressure in the European Monetary System.
Talks on public sector pay between the German government and the oTV trade
union also broke down at the weekend - and this could make the Bundesbank
more reluctant to cut short term rates.
The 1.0 percentage point monthly rise in December's rate of inflation in
North-Rhine Westphalia, appears to have depressed some investors, as did the
figure for M3 money supply in December, which was up 8.8 per cent on the
year. However, some analysts described both figures as far better than the
market could have hoped for.
All these factors combined to push the March French franc contract down a
remarkable 53 basis points, to close at 89.75, as dealers wondered how
quickly France will be able to cut rates. This closing level prices 3-month
money in two months time at 10.25 per cent. Three month French francs also
firmed sharply to 12 1/4 per cent from around 11 3/4 per cent last Friday.
One dealer said: 'There must now be pressure on the Bank of France to pass
the interest rate rises onto the commercial sector.'
In the sterling market, a shortage of Pounds 2.3bn helped push short term
money rates higher, in spite of a growing feeling that there will be an
early cut in UK base rates. Three-month money closed  1/4 per cent higher on
the day at around 7 1/16 per cent.
Several dealers said that they had been surprised that the weekend press had
not issued strong calls for more cuts in interest rates. This dampened some
of the bullishness that had been seen at the end of last week.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago and New York exchanges
plan merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF North America's largest futures exchanges yesterday announced that
they had agreed in principle to join operations, perhaps setting the stage
for other mergers as mature US futures markets struggle for economic
survival.
The Boards of Directors of the Chicago Board of Trade and New York's
Commodity Exchange (Comex) have agreed in principle to affiliate. Under the
plan, the CBoT would become the sole owner of the Comex, which has been
suffering financially in recent years.
The Comex is the US's fourth largest futures exchange, and its largest
metals exchange. The CBoT is the biggest exchange in the country, with
active trade in agricultural and financial products.
The marriage would allow the Comex to continue to trade its hallmark
precious metals futures while the CBoT would maintain its separate interest
rate and agricultural contracts. However, Mr Patrick Arbor, new chairman of
the CBoT, said other contracts could be traded jointly, with mutual access
for both memberships.
Under the plan, which still must be ratified by members of both exchanges,
the Comex and CBoT would combine their trade clearing operations and
marketing and administrative activities.
The pact was suggested to the two exchanges by Mr Richard Sandor, a CBoT
board member and the mastermind of the exchange's first interest rate
futures contracts. Exchange officials said the deal took less than 10 days
to consummate, leaving the impression it was a shotgun marriage.
Mr Arbor said Comex was on a solid financial footing, with Dollars 18
million in net worth, Dollars 12 million in cash on hand, and no outstanding
debt. The terms of the deal left the CBoT with 'virtually no risk'. The
merger, as presented, would be financed out of present and future Comex
earnings, he said.
Ms Donna Redel, Comex head, emphasised that the plan provided broad
economies for the two exchanges, and would improve their competitiveness
overseas and against over-the-counter markets domestically.
The pact represents a coup for the CBoT, which stands to garner the trading
power of the Comex's 1,000 members, as well as precious metals contracts
that it has been unable to sustain in Chicago.

New York arabica COFFEE prices tumbled in early trading yesterday on
pessimism over this week's International Coffee Organisation talks in
London. The continued chart-based selling in New York sparked further sharp
losses in the London robusta market, where the March contract touched a
three-month low of Dollars 850 a tonne. Dealers said that London had held up
comparatively well in view of the extent of losses in the US. Both markets
remain heavily oversold with the potential to stage short-term rallies. BASE
METAL trading on the LME was mostly routine, and prices ended broadly lower.
COPPER reversed a dip below the Dollars 2,220-a-tonne floor of the current
Dollars 10 range for three-month metal, closing unchanged at Dollars 2,228.
Analysts said the current formation on the charts suggested that any
eventual break-out would be sharp. LEAD prices fell to 5 3/4 -year lows in
sterling, but the decline largely reflected currency factors, with the
dollar equivalent little changed.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kuwait says it is willing to
join in oil output cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT YESTERDAY indicated its willingness to join other members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in cutting the cartel's second
quarter output as crude prices received some support from signs at the
weekend of an emerging consensus to peg back production by up to 1m barrels
a day.
Mr Ali al-Baghli, the Kuwait oil minister, said after talks with Mr Alirio
Parra, the Opec president, that all Opec members, including Kuwait itself,
should be prepared to cut output to shore up recently softer crude prices.
'Cuts are necessary from all states. . . without exception,' he said.
Crude prices began the week firmer after Mr Parra's remarks at the weekend
that his talks with both the Iranian and Saudi Arabian oil ministers had
reached agreement in 'substantial areas'. Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil
minister, said after his meeting with Mr Parra that all Opec members should
make pro-rata cuts amounting to 1m b/d at the February 13 meeting in Vienna
to decide second quarter production.
The March delivery price for North Sea Brent crude rose 52 1/2 cents
yesterday to Dollars 17.87 1/2 a barrel.
Mr Parra told reporters before flying to the United Arab Emirates yesterday
that he had discussed an overall cut in Opec production with Mr al-Baghli.
'I would hope that if we can adjust the foundation for the market to set the
rules of the game, that within those rules, prices will strengthen,' he
said.
Opec set an overall first quarter ceiling of 24.58m b/d at its November
meeting, but has seen significant leakage over that figure and a
corresponding slip in prices since. Most industry esitmates put present
output above 25m b/d.
Mr Parra said in Qatar yesterday that the proposed 1m b/d cut would amount
to an actual cut of '1.5m b/d or maybe more in view of the current
production level'.
Industry analysts said yesterday that an Opec commitment to cut output in
February would require a renewed and firm commitment to the original
November ceiling and then a further real cut of at least 400,000 to 500,000
b/d, bringing total output to around 24m b/d, before oil markets would be
convinced of Opec's resolve.
Mr Joe Stalislav, of Cambridge Energy Associates, said the 'revenue
imperative' was strong for all Opec members, but they had still to work out
'common language and common ground' on the details of an agreement.
A decision by Kuwait to curb output would substantially help Opec
discipline. The Gulf state has insisted since the Gulf war that it should be
immune from any output restrictions while it recovers revenues lost during
the war.
However, Kuwait is now pumping more than 1.7m b/d, above its formal pre-war
Opec quota of 1.5m b/d and oil ministry officials said as early as last year
that they might rethink output strategy once production reached present
levels.
Although the oil ministry has produced a schedule which anticipates
production rising to 1.85m b/d for the second quarter and moving up to 2.15m
b/d by the end of the year, the ministry has also previously entertained
holding output at near present levels so as to allow a comprehensive study
of possible damage to the oilfields sustained during the oil fires of 1991.
A decision to hold output at present levels, or even cut production
slightly, might therefore serve Kuwait's self-interest as well as overall
Opec discipline.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Growth plan offered to Danish
farming sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RESEARCH report for the Danish Ministry of Agriculture has brought a chink
of light to the country's farmers, who are at present sunk in gloom as a
result of the reform of the European Community's common agricultural policy
and the trend of negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The report, by the Institute for Food and Agroindustrial Development,
concludes that over a 20-year period the country should be able to double
the value of production by agriculture and horticulture, the food processing
industries and the agro-industrial sector as a whole from about DKr180bn
(Pounds 19bn) to DKr380bn (1990 prices). It says pig production can be
increased from about 16m a year now to at least 30m; horticultural output by
three or four times; and production value in the food processing industries
by a factor of three or four by raising the level of processing and value
added. the agro-industrial sector.
Denmark's strong tradition as an agricultural exporter means that it already
has exceptionally large world market shares in products such as pigmeat,
dairy products, seeds, mink pelts, fish products and several types of
machinery and food ingredients.
With a co-ordinated effort between the public and private sectors, it can
build on the existing basis to realise a high-growth strategy for the
industry, the report says. The barriers to success identified by the report
are not market limitations, as even a doubling of production value would
only increase Denmark's share of world markets from 3 to 4 per cent, but
domestic structural and institutional factors, especially factors preventing
a satisfactory capital accumulation and investment. This problem can be
solved by institutional and regulative changes, says the report, which
points to a need to increase annual investment in the total agro-industrial
sector from DKr10bn-12bn at present to DKr20bn-30bn by 2010 and in research
and development from DKr2bn-2.5bn to DKr12bn-17bn (1990 prices).

FT  26 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Row over financing threatens
future of UN development fund for small farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY RECENTLY

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of the Rome-based International Fund for Agricultural
Development, the United Nations' small farmer agency, is in doubt after the
failure of donor countries to agree about a replenishment of its finances.
Ifad is jointly funded by western countries and members of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries; it is widely recognised as one of the most
cost-efficient UN agencies. Set up in 1977, it makes interest-free loans to
small farmers in developing countries and has lent about Dollars 3.6bn for
337 projects in nearly 100 countries. It claims these projects are helping
to grow more than 40m extra tonnes of food a year.
But Ifad has been bedevilled by funding arrangements under which western
countries have traditionally contributed 60 per cent and the oil countries
40 per cent of its money. This arrangement has given rise to constant
disputes in the last 10 years, with oil countries arguing that they should
pay a smaller percentage because of lower oil prices.
Four meetings last year failed to resolve the issue of who should pay how
much for the fund's work for the next three years. A fifth meeting in Rome
last week again ended with no agreement.
Both groups agree that Ifad should be given about Dollars 600m for its next
three years' work. But while the West wants to maintain the 60:40 ratio, the
oil exporting nations want to contribute less. Saudi Arabia, the largest
contributor in the Opec group, last week aroused consternation by refusing
to say how much it was prepared to contribute. That gave rise to speculation
that its support for Ifad was on the wane.
In what seemed a veiled reference to Saudi Arabia, Mr Peter Freeman,
Britain's representative on Ifad's governing council, which also met last
week, said: 'If Ifad is to continue to perform a useful operation as a
separate institution it needs the support of its membership as a whole. If
some of the more prominent members feel that it has outlived its usefulness
then there will come a point at which we have to recognise that fact. In my
view we have not yet reached that point'.
Ifad's hopes of survival are now pinned on its new president who was elected
at the council to succeed Idris Jazairy of Algeria; Mr Fawzi Hamad Al-Sultan
of Kuwait, an executive director of the World Bank, who served as director
of the Kuwait Emergency and Recovery Programme in the aftermath of the Gulf
war.
The experience he gained in rebuilding Kuwait's economy is thought to have
been the decisive factor behind his election. Mr Al-Sultan, who takes over
as Ifad president this week, said he was keen to get the replenishment talks
going again as soon as possible.
Ifad now has about Dollars 150m a year coming in from its investments and
loans, but unless donor countries contribute it may not be viable as a
separate body. It hopes to lend Dollars 336m for 25 new agricultural
projects this year. Just before leaving office at the weekend, Mr Jazairy
said: 'If our funds are not replenished we shall have to cut down next
year'.
African countries who need support to move towards food self-sufficiency
could be hit hard by Ifad's demise. More than two-fifths of its loans have
been to Africa. The fund is now trying to finalise a loan that would help
Somali farmers who were hit by last year's disastrous drought. But such work
is in jeopardy unless it wins its survival battle.

shellfish ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Zealand government yesterday imposed a total ban on the taking of
all shellfish, closing an industry that employs 3,000 people and exports
mussels and oysters worth NZDollars 80m (Pounds 27m) a year to the US,
Europe and and Asia.
The ban follows a serious outbreak of a poison-producing algae that effects
filter feeding shellfish. Ten days ago all the northern North Island fish
farms and hatcheries were closed, but today the government extended the ban
to the rest of the country after a woman became ill after eating mussels in
the Marlborough Sounds at the northern end of the South Island, the main
farming area for shellfish.
Officials said that while there might be no connection, it was important
that New Zealand could be seen internationally to be doing everything
possible to contain the outbreak, which seemed to be related to higher
summer temperatures in the water.
The ban is expected to last 10 days.

FT  26 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries soar on hopes of tough approach
to deficit
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

US TREASURY prices roared ahead at the long end of the market yesterday on
growing hopes that the Clinton administration will take a tough line on
tackling the budget deficit.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  15/32 at 105
1/8 , yielding 7.199 per cent, its lowest level in more than five years. At
the short end of the market, the two-year note was only slightly firmer, up
 1/16 at 100 3/4 , to yield 4.197 per cent.
The market opened markedly higher as investors and dealers got their first
chance to react to Sunday's comments by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new Treasury
secretary, which suggested the White House views cutting the deficit as a
top priority. Treasury investors welcomed his reference to the possible
introduction of a broad-based energy tax that would be part of a plan to
reduce the deficit by about Dollars 145bn over the next four years.
Until recently, the bond markets have been concerned about President Bill
Clinton's willingness to tackle the deficit issue at a time when he wants to
boost economic growth through tax cuts and spending increases. Mr Bentsen's
remarks helped address some of those concerns.
UK government bond prices fell in quiet trading ahead of tomorrow's auction
of Pounds 2.5bn of 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 2007. The long end fell
about  1/2 point while the shorter end eased about  1/4 point.
With all eyes on the auction, prices failed to respond to the day's data
which economists said were broadly encouraging since they pointed to a
further cut in interest rates.
Lending by banks and building societies (M4) rose a seasonally adjusted
Pounds 0.2bn in December, an improvement on the November figure when lending
fell by Pounds 0.6bn, but below market forecasts of a rise of Pounds 1.8bn.
This suggested the private and corporate sectors remained wary of
accumulating new debts.
The Liffe March gilt future ended down  11/32 at 100 1/16 in moderate volume
of 18,816 lots.
GERMAN government bond prices fell on press reports that the German pay
talks had broken down, which prompted profit-taking after the recent
advance. As a result, the market ignored the better-than-expected M3 data
for December, which showed an annualised rise of 8.8 per cent against
forecasts of more than 9 per cent,
The market was cautious ahead of today's bond launch by the Treuhand
privatisation agency. Dealers expect a 10-year issue in the region of
DM10bn. The Liffe March bund contract traded just above the day's low of
92.66 in late trading, compared with a day's high of 93.01 and Friday's
close of 92.97, in average volume of just over 44,610 lots.
FRENCH government bond prices fell further than their German counterparts,
as the market turned its attention to the forthcoming legislative elections
in March.
Fading hopes of an interest rate cut, a slight firming of three-month funds
and some concern that the franc might come under renewed pressure prompted
investors to take their profits.
March futures lost over half a point to settle at their lowest level for two
weeks. The contract ended 54 basis points down at 112.86 on good volume of
129,352 lots.
ECU bond prices slipped in the absence of a cut in French interest rates.
The Matif Ecu futures contract fell from an opening of 110.04 to a low of
109.70, and ended at 109.78.
However, traders expect Thursday's auction of French government Ecu bonds to
boost the market. The French treasury announced on Friday that it plans to
auction Ecu500 to Ecu700m of a new 10-year Ecu stock. This will be the first
substantial issue of Ecu bonds since Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht
treaty in June last year which threw the Ecu bond market into confusion.
France has been one of the most significant issuers of Ecu bonds but has not
sold large amounts of Ecu bonds since April 1992. The return by the French
to the Ecu bond market is seen as an important show of confidence in the
Ecu, dealers said.
THE Swiss government bond market was enlivened by the government's
announcement of a maximum of SFr1bn of 5 1/4 per cent bonds due 1998.
Subscriptions close on Thursday and the issue price and final issue amount
will be announced on Friday.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Israel may lift privatisation
with bond conversions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

ISRAEL is considering making some government securities sold overseas
convertible into equity under the state's industrial privatisation plans,
the head of the Israel Bonds organisation said yesterday.
Last year was a record for sales of Israel bonds, a longstanding source of
borrowing for the state, mainly from the Jewish diaspora in the US. More
than Dollars 1.16bn was raised, compared with Dollars 990m in 1991.
But the high price paid, as long-term interest rates lagged declines in
short-term rates, and the prospective easing of Israel's external borrowing
costs due to the granting of US loan guarantees has led the government to
scale down its target for the sale of bonds through the organisation in 1993
to Dollars 1bn.
Meanwhile, Israel is keen to press ahead with its first borrowing under the
Dollars 10bn loan guarantees programme provided by the US government,
according to the accountant-general's office.
Thirteen US banks are competing for the mandate to arrange the issue in the
US bond market. Morgan Stanley is acting as an adviser on the programme and
so is excluded from the bidding process. The offering could total up to
Dollars 2bn, which would cover a projected Dollars 2bn current account
deficit.
The structure of the deal has not yet been decided, but the bonds could have
a life of up to 30 years, the maximum length of the US government guarantee.
However, the positive yield curve could discourage the government from
tapping the long end of the market, where rates are higher.
Mr Meir Rosenne, president of the Development Corporation for Israel, the
Israel Bonds organisation, said in Jerusalem that the finance ministry was
discussing a scheme under which bonds could be exchanged for shares in
government companies being privatised as a new way of channelling the
investments being made in bonds.
He also said he was shifting the emphasis in bonds marketing towards cheaper
15-year current income bonds. These carry a 4 per cent annual interest
payment and are considered the classic 'soft' instrument for attracting
investment from Jewish communities. Last year, they accounted for only 8 per
cent of all sales.
Half the total - Dollars 584m - was raised via a variable rate bond carrying
interest of 7.5 per cent until it was withdrawn in July. Mr Rosenne said he
wanted to increase sales of the lower interest bonds to 20 per cent of the
total. 'That would put us in much better shape,' he said.
The government originally set a target of Dollars 1.5bn for 1992, believing
a flood of immigration from the former Soviet Union would lead to balance of
payments problems. But a slowdown in immigration rates and the granting of
the US loan guarantees quickly changed the picture, making the bonds
programme appear excessively expensive.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Sweden to launch Y200bn, four-year
Samurai deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN plans to follow up its Y100bn Eurobond issue, launched 10 days ago,
with a Y200bn Samurai deal due to be announced in Japan today. The issue,
arranged by Nomura Securities, will be the largest Samurai bond (foreign
bond in the Japanese domestic bond market).
The latest offering will bring Sweden's SKr230bn (Dollars 30bn) borrowing
package announced last autumn close to completion. Only SKr25bn (Dollars
3.5bn) remains to be raised, according to Ms Christine Holm of the Swedish
debt office.
It is not clear whether the completion of the programme will signal the end
of the recent spate of Swedish offerings in the international bond markets.
The Swedish parliament lifted restrictions on foreign currency borrowing
last year, due to the country's mounting funding needs. The split between
foreign and domestic borrowing is now due to be re-examined, but a final
decision on the structure of Sweden's future borrowing is not likely to be
decided until April.
The four-year Samurai issue will pay a coupon of 4.2 per cent, and is partly
swapped, according to Ms Holm. The cost of funds is more competitive than
for the recent Euroyen deal, despite the higher fees charged in the Samurai
market.
The launch of the deal, so soon after the Euroyen offering, reflects strong
demand for yen-denominated debt from Japanese investors so far this year.
Strong expectations of a further rate cut and negative views on the stock
market, have fuelled domestic demand for bonds.
The deal is expected to be placed with a broad base of Japanese investors,
both institutional and retail.
Meanwhile, the National Bank of Hungary yesterday launched a Y40bn issue of
five-year Samurai bonds, carrying a 6 1/2 per cent coupon. The deal was
arranged by Daiwa Securities.
The Asian Development Bank, which tapped the Euroyen market only last week,
is also preparing to launch a Samurai bond offering, via Nomura Securities.
A Y30bn issue of 20-year Samurai Bonds is due to be launched in the next
month or so.
In the Eurolira bond market, Swedish Export Credit launched the first
swapped issue since the lira was withdrawn from the exchange rate mechanism
last September. Since then, the European Investment Bank, which has a
natural requirement for lira, has been the only issuer to tap the market.
The L150bn issue of five-year bonds, via Credito Italiano, proved to be
attractive to investors, due to the 12 per cent coupon.
The Italian bond market has rallied strongly due to expectations of falling
interest rates and an easing of concern about the currency.
However, a lack of swap opportunities is likely to limit further supply in
the sector.
The Aa1 senior debt rating of the Halifax Building Society, placed under
review for possible downgrade in December, has been confirmed by Moody's,
the US ratings agency, which cited the society's strong pre-provision
profitability.

is replacing Belgium's number one holding company Ste Generale de Belgique
as an option contract.
A spokesman said Belfox was negotiating with several brokers - including

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bols, Wessanen open door to
further mergers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERGER between Bols, the Dutch spirits, wine and beverages group, and
Wessanen, the Dutch foods group, is designed to produce a big new European
drinks company, including further mergers, possibly with a partner outside
the Netherlands.
The two companies, which unveiled the terms of their share swap proposal
yesterday, said the new company, to be called Bols Wessanen, would create a
'docking station' for potential future merger candidates.
'The door (to talks) is open, and they don't even have to knock to be
admitted,' said Mr Peter Bakker Schut, chairman of Wessanen.
A round of mergers would be welcome in the coming year, although no talks
were taking place, he said.
Last week, Bols and Wessanen were forced to announce merger talks after
rumours about a deal had leaked on to the floor of the Amsterdam stock
exchange, prompting the bourse to launch an insider trading investigation.
The merger will create a company with turnover of Fl 4.8bn (Dollars 2.68bn)
and a workforce of around 9,000.
The merger proposal, which the companies describe as a tie-up between equal
partners, calls first for Wessanen to make a 2.5-for-one share split to
reduce the nominal value of its shares to Fl 2, matching that of Bols.
Wessanen will then offer 1.185 new shares for each share in Bols. The
prospectus will be published in the first two weeks of March, with the deal
to be completed a month later.
Wessanen's shareholders will own 54.5 per cent of the new company against
45.5 per cent to be held by Bols' shareholders, reflecting Wessanen's
slightly bigger operating profit, net profit and market capitalisation.
Replying to some analysts' comments that they saw little industrial logic in
the move, Mr Bakker Schut and Mr Robert Schipper, the chairman of Bols, said
the two companies had converged over the past 10 years.
Together, they would be able to consider acquisitions of between Fl 200m and
Fl 400m a time rather than the current Fl 100m. Bols Wessanen would also
have a better currency and geographic spread.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Arnotts considers share buy-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit company, is considering a share buy-back
scheme to support the share price after the closure on Thursday of a
takeover offer by Campbell Soup, the US food group.
Arnotts said the scheme had been suggested by Schroders Australia, the
merchant bank which is advising the board. The buy-back would apply to up to
10 per cent of the stock.
However, Mr David Johnson, Campbell managing director, said the scheme was
'a transparent ruse born of panic'. Mr Johnson said Campbell would use its
shareholding to block the scheme.
'Campbell clearly has the power to block the buy-back. Make no mistake, we
would use that power,' he said.
Arnotts' shares have consistently traded above Campbell's offer price of
ADollars 9.50, but analysts have suggested they could fall as low as
ADollars 7 (USDollars 4.80) after the offer closes.
Schroders is believed to have suggested that the buy-back scheme might
persuade institutional shareholders to reject Campbell's offer by providing
an alternative buyer for part of their holdings.
Mr Paul Binstead, a Schroders director, said Campbell had agreed to the
inclusion of buy-back provisions in Arnotts' articles of association in
1990.
However, Mr Binstead said no decision on whether to proceed with the
buy-back would be made until after the offer expires.
Campbell has lifted its stake in Arnotts to 34.1 per cent from 33 per cent
since launching the bid. However, Campbell needs 85.1 per cent of the shares
to control the board because of a 1985 shareholding agreement.
Mr Bill Purdy, Arnotts' chairman, said he was confident that Campbell had
'no chance' of acquiring control because small shareholders and members of
the Arnott family were reluctant to sell.

A TURNROUND into profit at the Harmony gold mine helped Randgold, the gold
arm of the Barlow Rand group, to record a R6.7m (Dollars 2.2m) after-tax
profit during the December quarter compared to a R6.5m loss in the previous
quarter.
Harmony's performance, achieved with special government dispensation to
blast on Sundays, and to blast more than once in 24 hours, could well be
instrumental in hastening reform of restrictive laws which hamper
productivity in the gold mining industry. A number of other marginal mines
have sought similar government exemptions.
Harmony made an after-tax profit during the quarter of R8.5m compared with a
R5.7m loss the previous quarter. Mr John Turner, chairman, said permission
to blast on Sundays, granted in September, had diminished closure risks.
Elsewhere in the group, Durban Deep had a steady quarter with after-tax
profits of R963,000, against R1m. Blyvoor lifted taxed profit to R4.3m from
R1.5m. Losses at ERPM rose to R7m from R3.4m.

BANG &amp; OLUFSEN, the Danish audio and video equipment maker, made a DKr67m
(Dollars 10.9m) pre-tax loss for the six months to November, against a
profit of DKr2m last time, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. Sales fell
from DKr1.16bn to DKr1.06bn.
Last month, the group announced 400 redundancies and a reorganisation of its
European sales organisation. Charges for changes in the sales network and
the lower turnover were blamed for the poor first-half result.
The group said December sales were satisfactory, and forecast a break-even
result for the current half year.

Illinois Tool Works (ITW), the US engineering group, has extended its
ADollars 94m (USDollars 64.8m) takeover offer for Siddons Ramset, the

Brown in Sydney.
ITW, which has bid ADollars 2 a share for Siddons through an Australian
subsidiary, said it had extended the bid to allow financial institutions
more time to accept.
Pacific BBA, a subsidiary of BBA, the UK toolmaker, effectively abandoned a
rival bid for Siddons earlier this month by announcing that its ADollars 88m
offer would not be increased or extended beyond the deadline of January 27.

Brierley Investments, the New Zealand investment group, has unwound a joint

Mr Paul Collins, chief executive, said Brierley had acquired GPG's
half-share in Rossington Investments, the joint venture vehicle owning 96
per cent of Acil.
Rossington bought Acil for ADollars 131m (USDollars 90.3m) in May last year
after a takeover battle orchestrated by Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand
entrepreneur, who is chairman of GPG and a director of Brierley.
Acil recently sold its main asset, National Brewing Holdings, one of

A TURNROUND into profit at the Harmony gold mine helped Randgold, the gold
arm of the Barlow Rand group, to record a R6.7m (Dollars 2.2m) after-tax
profit during the December quarter compared to a R6.5m loss in the previous
quarter.
Harmony's performance, achieved with special government dispensation to
blast on Sundays, and to blast more than once in 24 hours, could well be
instrumental in hastening reform of restrictive laws which hamper
productivity in the gold mining industry. A number of other marginal mines
have recently sought similar exemptions from the government.
Harmony itself made an after-tax profit during the quarter of R8.5m compared
with a R5.7m loss the previous quarter. Mr John Turner, chairman of Harmony,
said permission to blast on Sundays, granted in September, had diminished
the risk of closure.
He added that the mine was not yet out of the woods and would have to
maintain current levels of grade and production to stay profitable. This
required continuing Sunday operations. The exemption granted in this respect
is to be reviewed in March.
During the December quarter, Harmony produced an extra 563kg of gold, out of
a total production of 5,305kg. This contributed an extra R13.2m working
profit to the mine's results.
Harmony, with a 14,600 workforce, is the largest marginal mine in the
industry. Its closure would have serious implications for the nearby Free
State town of Virginia.
Elsewhere in the group, Durban Deep had a steady quarter with after-tax
profits of R963,000, against R1m. Increased production and lower costs
helped Blyvooruitzicht lift taxed profit to R4.3m from R1.5m.
Losses at ERPM rose to R7m from R3.4m with production to 1,539kg from
1,685kg.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Merchant bankers flock to Rome -
Plans to privatise Italy's state sector are starting to take shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world's investment bankers are flooding to Rome as plans to privatise
many of the companies within Italy's overblown state sector take shape.
Their enthusiasm is understandable. The government hopes to raise L27,000bn
(Dollars 18.5bn) in the next three years through asset sales, while IRI, the
state holding company, is budgeting on a further L24,000bn as a means of
reducing borrowings running close to L70,000bn.
All this is music to the ears of the world's merchant bankers: and the
Italian treasury headed by Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, is their
first port of call.
Since the new Amato government took office in June, the treasury has become
the crucial force in the privatisation process. Political placemen in
state-owned companies have been largely replaced by senior treasury
officials, while the six-man committee of senior bankers and economists
looking into privatisation reports directly to Mr Barucci.
Although privatisation is still in its infancy, the competition among
bankers has already revealed some winners and losers. Most prominent among
the latter are the Italian houses. Italy's merchant banks often present
themselves as equal to big London and New York rivals when it comes to
domestic business. So far they look to have been left out in the cold.
Mediobanca, Italy's leading merchant bank, and Istituto Mobiliare Italiano,
the public-sector financial services group, have been given a broad mandate
to advise the treasury. But IMI, which has been asked by the ENI state
holding company to advise on selling its Nuovo Pignone engineering
subsidiary, is the only domestic bank so far to have been given a sizeable
specific mandate.
The absence of Italian houses reflects their inexperience in privatisation
business. No Italian bank yet has the expertise to handle a major valuation
based on comparative experience abroad.
Competitive and political considerations also contribute. Italian banks
needing corporate finance advisers have traditionally looked abroad to avoid
revealing confidential information to domestic rivals. In other cases, the
choice of a prestigious international bank has stemmed from political
concerns to underline the job is being done fairly and without party
political pressure.
British merchant banks have emerged well so far. SG Warburg has won plaudits
for valuing IMI, in which the government is trying to sell its 50 per cent
stake. Barings is valuing the big INA insurance group, while Kleinwort
Benson last year valued the treasury's share in the Crediop long-term
lending bank.
Some US houses have also prospered. IRI chose Merrill Lynch to recommend
strategies, and find buyers, for its 67 per cent stake in Credito Italiano,
Italy's sixth-biggest bank. Lehman Brothers is starting to see the rewards
for months of painstaking work for Finmeccanica and Stet, IRI's engineering
and telecommunications subsidiaries. Though not yet privatisation
candidates, both are poised for substantial restructuring prior to a
reduction in the state's shareholding.
Goldman Sachs, Swiss Bank Corporation, Paribas and Lazards are still locked
in the seemingly interminable task of advising ENI on the flotation of its
Agip and Snam subsidiaries. The timing - the deal was initially to have been
completed by the end of last year - has suffered from changes in government
policy between floating the subsidiaries or ENI itself.
But the clear winner so far has been Wasserstein Perella, the US investment
bank formed by former First Boston employees. In spite of its relatively
small size and youth compared with its rivals, it has already won a
disproportionally large slice of business.
Wasserstein Perella's biggest prize has been in advising IRI on
restructuring its SME food, retailing and catering subsidiary. After
blueprinting the break-up, it has now been charged with finding buyers for
the various operations on the block.
Earlier, it advised SME on disposing of some smaller joint ventures. And it
has established a strong rapport with Finmeccanica, whose Esaote Biomedica
subsidiary it is now trying to sell.
Wasserstein Perella's success has created ill-feelings among its rivals,
particularly banks which have both commercial and investment banking
relationships with the state holding companies. 'We are one of the biggest
foreign lenders to IRI, which borrows at highly competitive rates,' says one
leading European bank representative. 'But so far we haven't had any
advisory business, in spite of submitting various interesting and
competitive proposals.'
Wasserstein Perella's mandates have triggered allegations, so far only in
private, that it has benefited from privileged contacts with the Amato
government.
In April 1991, Wasserstein appointed Mr Franco Reviglio, a prominent
university professor and former ENI chairman, as an Italy-based 'senior
international adviser'. When the new government took office, Mr Reviglio
became budget minister, putting him in one of the three key ministries
concerned with privatisation.
Wasserstein Perella asserts Mr Reviglio terminated his contract on election
as a Socialist party senator in the April 1992 polls. 'That was months
before he even knew would be made a minister,' says a banker. Since then,
professional contacts with the bank are said to have wholly stopped, but
some competitors view the bank's recent successes with disquiet.
It takes more, however, than a senior Italian figurehead to win mandates.
The presence of Mr Romano Prodi, a former IRI chairman, as adviser to
Goldman Sachs, a top Wall Street name, has not won it any IRI privatisation
business so far.
Indeed, some bankers suggest having a heavyweight Italian official on the
letterhead can be a positive disadvantage. Though potentially useful as an
intermediary thanks to privileged friendships or party political contacts,
'their backgrounds can often close as many doors as they open', says one
banker.
'You must remember the Italian system is based on consensus. It only takes
one veto to block a mandate,' says a senior official at one state holding
company. 'In Italy, it's probably more important to have few enemies than
lots of friends.'
But personal factors do count up to a point. Wasserstein Perella's success
is partly based on the relationships established when Wasserstein officials
were still working for First Boston. The latter advised Finmeccanica on
crucial deals such as the sale of Alfa Romeo and the acquisition of Bailey
Controls in the US. They also worked for SME on other transactions.
'That created a firm bond for winning future mandates', notes one IRI
executive. The risk for a relatively small house like Wasserstein Perella is
to ensure customer relationships rest on more than one individual to avoid
disruption should key staff jump ship.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Slow economy restrains Corning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORNING, the US specialty glass group, yesterday reported a 6 per cent
improvement in underlying fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 91.6m, or 47
cents a share.
During the quarter, Corning adopted new accounting standards which reduced
reported net income by Dollars 45.3m. Corning's post-retirement benefits
expense increased by Dollars 5.1m.
Including these items, net income fell to Dollars 41.2m, or 21 cents a
share, from Dollars 85.6m, or 45 cents last year.
Sales rose 21 per cent to Dollars 996.2m from Dollars 826.3m.
Mr James Houghton, chairman, said: 'The strong improvement in consolidated
operations was led throughout the year by growth businesses, primarily
optical fibre and cable, laboratory services and environmental products.
'However, we continued to be restrained by a sluggish world economy,
particularly in Brazil, Europe and Japan.'
For the full year, Corning posted a net loss of Dollars 12.6m, or 8 cents,
on sales of Dollars 3.71bn, against net income of Dollars 316.8m, or Dollars
1.69, on sales of Dollars 3.26bn in 1991.
Stripping out one-time items in both years, Corning's 1992 earnings rose 10
per cent to Dollars 343.4m, or Dollars 1.81.
The company's Dow Corning 50-50 joint venture with Dow Chemical, which was
once the largest maker of silicone gel breast implants, continued to hurt
Corning's earnings.
Weak operating results and one time-charges at Dow Corning reduced equity
company earnings significantly in both the fourth quarter and full year.
Corning said the decline was moderated by strong earnings from
Samsung-Corning, which more than doubled its earnings.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bankers Trust climbs 24%
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS TRUST, the big New York banking group, yesterday unveiled a healthy
24 per cent rise in fourth-quarter 1992 net earnings, to Dollars 170m, or
Dollars 1.97 per share.
The profits improvement occurred despite halved fourth-quarter trading
revenues of Dollars 101m. It was helped along by lower bad debt provisions
and higher net interest and fee income.
The bank's net interest revenues before provisions in the fourth quarter was
Dollars 396m, sharply higher than the Dollars 168m recorded in the last
quarter of 1991.
Fiduciary and funds management generated Dollars 158m of revenues, up by 19
per cent year-on-year. Fees and commissions were up 9 per cent at Dollars
144m.
Fourth-quarter bad debt provisions declined by 25 per cent to Dollars 50m.
Provisions for the whole of 1992 were 13 per cent lower at Dollars 225m.
Total non-performing assets were down by 4 per cent to Dollars 2.46bn in the
final quarter of 1992.
For the full year, Bankers Trust recorded Dollars 761m, or Dollars 8.82 per
share, of net profits, up by 14 per cent on the Dollars 667m, or Dollars
7.75, earned in 1991.
Mr Charles Sanford, chairman of Bankers Trust, said the results demonstrated
the inherent strength within the bank's portfolio of businesses, including
risk management, underwriting, advisory, asset management, lending and
operational services.
He said favourable trends in asset quality positioned the bank for a
promising 1993.
The bank's capital was also strengthened during 1992, with total equity of
Dollars 3.8bn at year-end, some Dollars 397m higher than at the end of 1991.
The important tier one capital-to-assets ratio used by bank regulators was
7.65 per cent at year-end.
On Wall Street, the bank's share price was Dollars 1 1/8 lower at Dollars 66
5/8 at the close.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Rockwell buys Sundstrand unit
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROCKWELL International, the diversified US electronics manufacturer, is to
acquire the data control division of Sundstrand, for Dollars 225m.
Rockwell plans to merge the Sundstrand unit with Collins Commercial
Avionics, its civilian avionics business.
Sundstrand said in a statement that the sale would result in a 'significant,
non-recurring financial gain'.
Sundstrand Data Control manufactures flight data and cockpit voice
recorders, ground proximity and wind shear warning computers, flight
management systems and other instrument systems for use in aircraft.
The company has operations in Washington and Arizona and had 1991 sales of
approximately Dollars 216m.
'Our decision to sell Data Control is based on our belief that it will be
better positioned to serve future integrated cockpit and flight safety
markets by teaming with a company whose core business is avionics,' said Mr
Harry Stonecipher, Sundstrand chairman, president and chief executive.
The Sundstrand unit will be merged with Rockwell's Collins Commercial
Avionics, based in Iowa, which produces communications, navigation, flight
control and position location products.
Rockwell recently reported first-quarter net income of Dollars 127.8m, up 4
per cent from the same period last year. Earnings per share were 58 cents,
up from 54 cents.
Its sales, however, declined to Dollars 2.49bn from Dollars 2.56bn in the
first quarter of fiscal 1992.
The company said sales of industrial automation and telecommunications
products rose strongly, while earnings of its avionics operations also
advanced.
Defence electronics earnings declined slightly. Aerospace earnings were
down, reflecting lower sales to the Space Shuttle programme.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Shearson loss behind sharp fall
at American Express
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment banking and brokerage
subsidiary, helped cause a sharp slump in fourth-quarter 1992 net income at
American Express, the travel and financial services group.
American Express suffered a 65.4 per cent drop in net profits in the last
quarter of 1992, to Dollars 82m. For the whole of 1992, American Express
earnings before accounting charges were 44.7 per cent lower at Dollars 436m.
Shearson's fourth-quarter loss, a result of legal provisions and property
writedowns, was Dollars 166m. This compared to a Dollars 130m net profit in
the same quarter of 1991.
For the whole of 1992, Shearson lost Dollars 116m, compared to a 1991 net
profit of Dollars 207m.
Revenues at American Express were unchanged in the fourth quarter at Dollars
6.7bn and 4 per cent higher at Dollars 26.96bn for the whole year.
The group's core travel related services (TRS) division saw its 1992 net
profit slump to Dollars 243m from Dollars 396m in 1991. The results included
a third-quarter Dollars 342m after-tax restructuring charge. Fourth-quarter
TRS net income recovered to Dollars 181m from Dollars 81m a year earlier.
American Express Bank saw its 1992 net profit fall to Dollars 26m from
Dollars 60m in 1991.
The IDS Financial Services division reported 1992 net income of Dollars
297m, up by 20 per cent year-on-year. First Data Corporation, a financial
services processing business in which American Express reduced its
shareholding last year from 100 to 54 per cent, had 20 per cent better net
earnings of Dollars 141m in 1992.
Mr James Robinson, who gave up his job as chief executive to Mr Harvey Golub
yesterday while remaining as chairman of the group, said Shearson Lehman had
strengthened its balance sheet during 1992.
He said the emphasis would be on improving profitability at Shearson in 1993
as he takes over as chairman and chief executive of the American Express
subsidiary.
Mr Robinson said significant items in 1992 included a fourth-quarter legal
provision and property write-down of Dollars 166m at Shearson; Dollars 300m
of added reserves at The Balcor Company, a property subsidiary; Dollars 150m
of charges related to Shearson's holding in Computervision, a company which
had received a bridge loan from the investment bank; and a Dollars 425m gain
on First Data Corporation, which had shares floated last year in a public
offer.

COST-CUTTING measures and higher natural gas prices helped Chevron and Amoco
post better-than-expected fourth-quarter operating earnings yesterday.
Chevron, one of the biggest US oil and gas companies, saw the quarter's
earnings from operations soar to Dollars 542m, or Dollars 1.64 a share, from
Dollars 283m, or 81 cents, last time.
Reported net income was distorted by one-time gains of Dollars 546m in the
1992 quarter and charges of Dollars 244m in the 1991 quarter, bringing net
earnings to Dollars 1.09bn, or Dollars 3.30, in the latest quarter against
Dollars 39m, or 11 cents, the previous year. Revenues rose to Dollars
11.39bn from Dollars 10.39bn.
For the full year, Chevron had net income of Dollars 1.57bn, or Dollars 4.63
a share, on revenues of Dollars 42.89bn, compared with earnings of Dollars
1.29bn, or Dollars 3.69, on revenues of Dollars 40.95bn in 1991. In 1992,
Chevron took charges of Dollars 641m for accounting changes.
Amoco, the Chicago-based integrated petroleum company had fourth-quarter
income of Dollars 548m, or Dollars 1.10 a share. A year earlier it earned
Dollars 153m, or 31 cents, including one-time charges of Dollars 47m.
Revenues rose slightly to Dollars 7.24bn from Dollars 7.18bn.
For the full year, Amoco had a net loss of Dollars 74m, or 15 cents.
Excluding new accounting standards, the company earned Dollars 850m, or
Dollars 1.71.
In 1991, Amoco reported profits of Dollars 1.48bn, or Dollars 2.98 a share.
Stripping out accounting changes, last year's earnings stood at Dollars
1.17bn, or Dollars 2.36.
Atlantic Richfield (Arco), the Los Angeles-based oil and gas company, turned
in fourth-quarter net income of 372m, or Dollars 2.30, compared with Dollars
268m, or Dollars 1.67, last year. In the latest quarter, one-time gains of
Dollars 75m were partially offset by environmental-related charges.
For the year, Arco earned Dollars 801m, or Dollars 4.96, compared with
Dollars 709m, or Dollars 4.39, in 1991.
Stripping out accounting changes and other items, full-year earnings rose 5
per cent to Dollars 1.05bn, or Dollars 6.52, from Dollars 1bn, or Dollars
6.21, in 1991.
Unocal had fourth-quarter earnings from operations of Dollars 91m, or 34
cents a share, up from Dollars 21m, or 9 cents, a year ago. One-time items
contributed to reported net earnings of Dollars 103m, or 39 cents, against a
net loss of Dollars 16m, or 7 cents, last time.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Lines open for BT link with GM -
Martin Dickson and Paul Taylor examine suggestions that the UK company may
be about to take a stake in Electronic Date Systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Electronic Data Systems, the computer services subsidiary of
General Motors, rose sharply yesterday morning amid market speculation that
British Telecom might be discussing buying a stake in the business.
Both companies declined to comment on 'speculation and market rumours',
which originated last Saturday with a report in the Dallas Morning News that
British Telecom might take a 25 per cent stake in EDS. The American company,
which is based in Dallas, has a market capitalisation of nearly Dollars
17bn.
However, analysts detected signs that the two companies may have at least
been discussing some form of co-operation and shares in General Motors'
Class E stock, whose value is tied to EDS's performance, rose Dollars 1 3/8
to close at Dollars 35 3/8 yesterday. On Friday it rose Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 34.
The class E stock was first issued by General Motors when it acquired EDS in
1984 from the company's founder, Mr Ross Perot, who severed his relations
with both businesses in 1986 after repeated disputes with GM's management.
GM still owns some 40 per cent of the stock.
Class E shareholders have no direct, legal right to EDS's assets, which are
controlled by GM, but dividends paid on the stock are based on EDS's
performance.
Some form of tie-up between BT and EDS could benefit both sides as
telecommunications and computer services industries increasingly overlap,
but it would also raise fresh questions about British Telecom's patchy
record of business forays in North America.
Since privatisation in 1984 BT has made a series of expensive investments in
the North American market as part of its international strategy, but these
have not proved particularly successful.
In November, BT agreed to sell its three-year-old minority stake in McCaw
Cellular Communications, the US mobile phone group, to American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph. The sale will be worth Dollars 49-a-share, or about Dollars
1.8bn, when it is completed later this year and has been widely perceived as
saving shareholders from an expensive error.
The same month BT recorded a sharp drop in its half-year pre-tax earnings,
mainly because of exceptional charges to cover the sale of its interest in
Mitel Corporation, the troubled Canadian telephone equipment manufacturer in
which BT took a controlling 51 per cent stake in 1985.
However, the central plank of BT's international strategy remains its
ambitious plans to provide global telecommunications services to
multinational companies.
As part of this strategy BT established Syncordia, an Atlanta, Georgia-based
network management company, which operates GNS, a data communications
company, and has developed a plan dubbed Operation Cyclone to invest Dollars
1bn over the next decade in infrastructure outside the UK.
A link with EDS might provide Syncordia with more credibility and access to
business cus-tomers.
For GM, an investment in EDS by an outside party would mean a useful
injection of cash when the motor company has been financially stretched by
two years of severe losses. However, GM has said in the past that EDS, one
of its more profitable businesses, is not for sale outright.
For EDS itself, an outside partner in the telecommunications field might
help its penetration of international markets, though it already has a
sophisticated international telecommunications network of its own.
A new equity stakeholder could also give its management additional freedom
from GM's embrace. Relations between GM and EDS were volatile in the early
years, as the cultures of the two companies clashed, but analysts say they
are now much better.
EDS, estimated to be the world's largest provider of computer services, has
enjoyed rapid growth in recent years which has sharply reduced its
dependence on GM for revenues.
It still handled most of GM's computer operations, but its non-GM revenues
could reach 70 per cent of the total by 1995, compared to just 29 per cent
in 1985.
Its business involves systems integration - designing computer networks -
and 'outsourcing' of data processing, which means managing clients' entire
computer operations.

MERRILL LYNCH Japan, the local subsidiary of the US securities house, is to
close three of its six branches, ending its drive to establish a strong
presence in the Japanese securities' retail market.
The US broker, which plans to shift retail resources to its institutional
business, has suffered along with Japanese brokers from the sharp fall in
trading volume and prices on the Tokyo exchange over the past three years.
Merrill Lynch's move to close branches in Kyoto, Kobe and Yokohama is part
of a restructuring of Japanese operations by foreign brokerages. Last month,
County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster Bank, gave up
membership on the Tokyo exchange.
Individual investors have been net sellers for the past two years in Japan,
while non-financial companies have left the market in large numbers,
draining the pool of potential customers which Merrill Lynch had hoped to
tap.
'This is the end of the retail experiment by foreign houses in Japan,' a UK
broker said. 'You can see why Merrill would go for the retail market here
because it is strong in the US retail market, but it has not worked.'
In addition to operations in the three largest Japanese cities, Tokyo, Osaka
and Nagoya, the US broker opened the Yokohama branch in 1988, the Kyoto
branch in 1989, and the Kobe branch in 1991, by which time the Tokyo market
was well into its descent.
Merrill Lynch said the changes in Japan were part of an international
strategy to focus on institutional-type investors and profit from their
interest in the derivatives and yen-debt markets.
'We are still deciding when the branches will be closed. We had been hoping
for more business from small and mid-sized companies and wealthy
individuals, but we will be shifting resources more to institutional
business,' Merrill Lynch said.

SANTA FE PACIFIC, the US railroad and minerals group, and Hanson, the
UK-based conglomerate, last night formally signed an agreement swapping
major mineral assets, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
The deal was first revealed two weeks ago and involves assets worth around
Dollars 500m on each side.
Under the agreement, Hanson is acquiring virtually all of Santa Fe's coal
assets, including the Lee Ranch Coal Mine and undeveloped coal reserves
located mainly in New Mexico. Santa Fe is taking over certain gold assets
belonging to Hanson's Gold Fields Mining Company.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc share sale is
over-subscribed

<TEXT>
THE French government announced last night that the sale of shares in
Rhone-Poulenc, the flagship French chemicals company, had been healthily
over-subscribed.
The sale, which forms part of the socialist administration's partial
privatisation programme, involved the sale of 6m shares at FFr500 (Dollars
94) each.
The finance ministry said last night that demand from French investors had
been so strong that part of the 255,000 shares originally allocated for
foreign investors would be transfered to France.
Originally the French government had intended to stage the Rhone-Poulenc
share sale late last year.
However, the sale was postponed because of the precarious state of the Paris
stock market, then very volatile in the wake of a series of money market
attacks on the French franc.
Rhone-Poulenc is one of a number of France's state-controlled companies to
be involved in the partial privatisation programme which is expected to
accelerate if, as the opinion polls suggest, the right returns to power
after the French legislative elections in March.

WEYERHAEUSER, the US forest products group, yesterday posted sharp gains in
fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting improved economic conditions and the
benefits of the company's restructuring, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
Net income for the three months to December 27 was Dollars 85.3m, or 42
cents a share, on sales which rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2.34bn.
A year earlier, Weyerhaeuser took restructuring charges of Dollars 283m
which contributed to a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 256.4m, or Dollars
1.27, on sales of Dollars 2.13bn. Excluding special items, it earned Dollars
26.6m, or 13 cents, a year ago.
For the whole of 1992, earnings amounted to Dollars 372m, or Dollars 1.83,
on sales of Dollars 9.2bn, against a net loss of Dollars 162m, or 80 cents,
on sales of Dollars 8.7bn.
Stripping out one-time items in 1991, the group earned Dollars 182.1m, or 90
cents, last year.
Its timberlands and wood products division posted near record fourth-quarter
earnings.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ivaco to sell 52% Laclede stake

<TEXT>
IVACO, a Canadian steel products group with 75 per cent of its business in
the US, has put its 52 per cent controlling interest in Laclede up for sale,
writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
Laclede, based in the US, has nearly 1m tonnes of modern steelmaking
capacity and several product plants. It has weathered the recession in good
shape, with book value at around USDollars 100m.
However, Ivaco, carrying a high debt load from rapid expansion in the early
1980s, has been hit by the long recession and a high Canadian dollar from
1988 to early 1992.
It has appointed Paine Webber, the New York investment bankers, to find a
buyer.
Lower interest charges and other non-operating factors helped Imperial Oil,
Canada's biggest oil company and a subsidiary of Exxon of the US, lift net
earnings by 20 per cent last year, writes Bernard Simon.
However, lower crude oil volumes, pipeline limitations and narrower margins
on refined products continued to depress the company's operating
performance.
Net earnings rose to CDollars 195m (USDollars 152.3m), or CDollars 1.01 a
share, from CDollars 162m, or 84 cents, in 1991. Fourth-quarter earnings
were CDollars 51m, compared with a CDollars 124m loss. Annual revenues fell
to CDollars 9.13bn from CDollars 9.5bn.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Norwegian bank losses revised
upwards
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NORWEGIAN Banks Association, a group representing the country's
commercial banks, has increased its estimate of members' 1992 composite
losses to NKr4bn to NKr5bn from NKr3bn (Dollars 442m).
It warned that some banks may also need state cash in 1993. In the past five
years, the state has injected an estimated NKr20bn to prop up the ailing
commercial bank sector.
The association estimated that the commercial banks' combined credit loss in
1992 was NKr8bn to NKr9bn, down from a record NKr15bn in 1991.
The banks' non-performing loans in 1992 hit NKr20bn while property acquired
by the banks last year due to defaults on loans had a total value of NKr7bn,
resulting in an estimated loss of income of NKr3bn.
It has also been estimated that the value of domestic commercial and
residential property in the past five years has plunged by NKr500bn,
resulting in the banks writing-off an estimated NKr60bn on their property
portfolios.
The association said that high interest rates on deposits had made it more
attractive for the banks to raise capital domestically, rather than in
international capital markets.
London-based financial analyst Fox-Pitt, Kelton warned in a report that Den
norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, was not likely to post earnings until
1995.
'Further large losses anticipated for 1993 could be sufficiently large to
wipe out at least some of (DnB's) preference capital. In any case, no
meaningful earnings are likely before 1995, by which time dilution from the
conversion of government preference stock could be huge,' the analyst said.
DnB's ordinary share capital was written down to zero by the government at
the end of November, after losses had plunged the bank's capital adequacy
below the minimum 8 per cent requirement.
The state was therefore forced to provide DnB with NKr1.5bn in new
preference capital and a guarantee of NKr600m, boosting its DnB shareholding
to an estimated 70 per cent.
Norway's 134 savings banks achieved their best performance last year,
turning a combined net loss of NKr1.63bn in 1991 into a profit of NKr850m
for 1992, according to preliminary figures revealed by the Savings Banks'
Association. The sharp improvement in 1992 was helped by reduced credit
losses, higher net interest income and lower operating costs.
'The savings banks are on their way out of the (banking) crisis. There is
much work left to be done - like reducing further credit losses and
improving earnings - before we can say the (savings) banks are completely
out of the crisis,' said Mr Hans Halle, an association executive.

GERBER Products, the US consumer products and services group, reported
third-quarter net earnings of Dollars 26.5m, or 36 cents a share. This
compared with Dollars 14.5m, or 19 cents, a year earlier, but this was after
an after-tax charge of Dollars 16m, or 21 cents, to restructure the
company's apparel operations, Reuter reports from Fremont.
The group, which raised baby food prices in October, blamed the 10 per cent
profits fall, excluding the charge, on a drop in orders due to higher price
competition and a declining US birth-rate.

Its timberlands and wood products division posted near record fourth-quarter
earnings, driven by strong prices.
The company benefited from environmental regulations which have reduced the
supply of timber and pushed up prices.
Operating profits from forest products stood at Dollars 175m for the quarter
and Dollars 515m for the year. A year earlier, the division had a
fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 67m and earnings of Dollars 155m for the
year, including restructuring charges of Dollars 152m in the 1991 fourth
quarter.
Pulp and paper operations saw operating profits of Dollars 47.8m in the 1992
fourth quarter and Dollars 251m for the year.

FT  26 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for drug stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KEY pharmaceutical stocks fell sharply as a result of bearish sentiment,
somewhat jaded stories, currency shifts and a very cool attitude from US
investors. The slide in Glaxo and Wellcome, although checked by the close of
trading, accounted for almost half the overall loss in the FT-SE 100 index
yesterday.
Glaxo, whose price moves have the greater impact in the Footsie, was also
the hardest hit. Sentiment was against it from the start of trading as
dealers took note of a Sunday newspaper article which focused on the lack of
new products and worries over the patent on Zantac, its highest earning drug
product.
Wellcome suffered from the backwash of two stories in the US press,
concerning Retrovir, its widely-used Aids treatment. Neither story was
particularly new but they provided a focal point on a day when sterling made
gains of nearly four cents against the dollar.
The currency shift left UK shares overpriced compared with their New York
equivalent and forced marketmakers to cut prices. Also, analysts from
Goldman Sachs, the New York investment bank, returned yesterday from a
ten-day roadshow in the US, to disclose that very few clients showed
interest in UK drug stocks. Glaxo, down 24 at one stage recovered to close
17 lower at 695p on turnover of 5m shares. Wellcome fell a net 14 to 915p.
Lloyds wanted
The absence of any predatory move from Lloyds Bank was the signal for a
strong recovery in its shares yesterday. Suggestions that it was about to
launch a bid for another bank were rife in the market last week and appear
to have been responsible for marked weakness in Lloyds shares against an
outperforming banks sector.
During the five-day period Lloyds shares fell 2 per cent while Barclays rose
over 10 per cent and NatWest almost 5 per cent. Favourites to attract a bid
from Lloyds were Royal Bank of Scotland,Standard Chartered and TSB.
Although not dismissing the possibility of a Lloyds bid for Royal Bank or
Standard, specialists said a move to acquire the minority holding in Lloyds
Abbey Life, the life assurance business in which it has a controlling 60 per
cent stake, might be a more likely move. Lloyds Bank jumped 12 to 511p, on
1.8m traded, while Royal Bank of Scotland edged up 4 to 225p. Lloyds Abbey
Life eased 3 to 434p.
Guinness drifts
Hints from some corners of the market that French luxury goods group LVMH
may be looking to restructure its 24 per cent shareholding agreement with
Guinness upset the shares, which retreated 2 1/2 to 466p. Most of the
speculation emanated from French sources, but yesterday's story - reported
in the Paris press and based on a broker's note - caused little excitement
in London.
Most UK based analysts were dismissive of the notion, which is said to have
surfaced during speculation that LVMH needed to raise cash to make a big
acquisition. They argued that if both groups were to reduce their holdings
it would not only depress their shares but also disproportionately hit
LVMH's profits, nearly one third of which come from Guinness.
Stylo active
Following last week's sale of a 26 per cent stake in Stylo, the footwear
group, institutional demand and speculative interest combined to send the
shares surging forward. The stake, which had belonged to Control Securities,
was placed on Thursday with institutions at 90p, a generous discount to the
then market price of 110p.
Brisk demand by institutions continued yesterday, with the shares jumping 17
to 125p. There was unconfirmed speculation of stake building by one
anonymous buyer. After the market closed it was announced that a member of
the Ziff family, which holds around 20 per cent of the equity and management
control, bought 30,000 shares at 90p on Thursday.
In the transport sector, the spotlight fell on NFC as some market players
belatedly caught up with last week's reports that the company would soon
announce the sale of its Waste Management subsidiary for around Pounds 100m
to a US buyer.
The company remained coy, but the shares jumped 10 to 271p, to make them one
of the best performers of the day in percentage terms, as turnover rose to
4.5m.
Internationally traded stocks suffered from the effect of a weaker dollar
against the pound. ICI shares, up in early trading on the belief that
selling from Goldman Sachs had dried up, slipped after the US market opened
and closed 4 off at 1107p. RTZ fell 9 to 656p and BAT Industries shed 7 at
966p. However, Reuters Holdings appeared to have hit a floor following heavy
selling last week and rose 3 to 1313p.
Recent buy recommendations from Smith New Court continued to drive Refuge
Assurance, 15 up at 850p, and Britannic Assurance, 20 firmer at 1118p.
The bad weather sweeping the UK over the weekend and in the recent past
prompted a general markdown of the composite insurers along with Prudential
and Legal &amp; General. But specialists said there was no real downside
pressure on the individual stocks. General Accident eased 12 to 569p and
Commercial Union 5 to 619p.
BT were well supported, moving up 5 1/2 to 387 1/2 p after US newspaper
reports that the company may be interested in buying a substantial stake in
Electronic Data Systems, the General Motors subsidiary. Vodafone, on the
other hand, suffered from US reports linking cellular phones with medical
problems. the shares slipping 7 1/2 to 383 1/2 p.
Reports that Opec is on the way to agreeing a reduction in output ahead of
the February 13 meeting of Opec members, helped sustain an oil sector
featured by strong late US buying of BP. Optimism that a reduction of around
1m barrels day in Opec's output could be implemented saw crude oil prices
rise some 60 cents a barrel.
BP were under light pressure during early trading but attracted keen
overseas demand towards the close as US investors chased the stock higher in
New York. In London the stock settled marginally higher at 231 1/2 p on
heavy turnover of 12m shares, with specialists saying that BP will
outperform Shell if crude oil prices improve in the wake of Opec output
cuts. Shell edged up 4 to 530p on much thinner trade of 2.2m shares. Lasmo
added 3 more to 154p, still boosted by recent broker buy notes.
Rights issue talk faded away from Allied Lyons and the shares moved forward
6 to 597p, also helped by buying from Kleinwort Benson.
Midlands Radio returned to the market with a sharp rise of 16 to 128p
following its suspension on Friday. The suspension surrounded the
announcement of a 130p a share bid from Capital Radio worth Pounds 17.7m.
Capital gained a penny to 179p with one analyst commenting that the market
liked the synergy of the deal and the fact that Capital was dipping into its
own cash rather than calling on shareholders for extra funds.
Haynes Publishing jumped 29 to 263p following comment in one Sunday
newspaper and ahead of interim results on February 1 for which broker Beeson
Gregory forecasts profits of Pounds 3m.
Shares in British Aerospace bucked the market trend and jumped 12 to 227p,
on speculation that the Al-Yamamah 2 defence contract with Saudi Arabia
would soon be signed and talk of further hawk orders from Indonesia and
possibly India.
The shares have out-performed the market by 50 per cent over the last 3
months.
Rolls-Royce eased 3 to 113p, on reports that Trans World Airlines may cancel
plans to buy up to A 330 aircraft from Airbus Industrie that are to be
powered by Rolls supplied engines.

FT  26 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar stocks lead the market down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKNESS in the US currency depressed dollar earning stocks in London
yesterday, adding to the pressures on the stock market from domestic
factors. Uncertainty over prospects for domestic interest rates continued,
fuelled by weaker December money supply and bank lending data than expected.
Also fears of impending rights issues hovered over the investment scene.
The impact of a relatively optimistic report on business opinion in the UK
from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) had no lasting effect on
the market yesterday. Although the CBI said that significantly more members
had expressed economic optimism than in the previous survey, taken four
months ago, share prices soon abandoned a brief foray into positive
territory yesterday morning.
The FT-SE Index was 14 points down at the day's low but rallied when Wall
Street, ignoring the dollar, opened the new trading session with a gain of
30 Dow points in London trading hours. The final reading showed the FT-SE
Index at 2,771.9 for a net loss of 9.3.
Trading volume was modest, at least among the blue chip stocks. But second
line issues attracted increased attention, with turnover in non FT-SE listed
stocks providing around 65 per cent of total Seaq volume of 490.3m shares.
'Investors see no rush to get aboard the FT-SE listed stocks at present,'
commented Mr Michael Hicks, senior trader at Strauss Turnbull, the London
securities arm of Societe Generale.
Adverse developments among the pharmaceuticals, added to dollar weakness,
took a heavy toll of the blue chip sector, with Glaxo a notably dull feature
in the wake of negative reviews in the UK press. Currency factors unsettled
ICI, replacing an early gain with a small loss at the end of the day. The
heavy end of the insurance sector lost ground.
Hopes of acquisition or similar corporate developments continued to rise,
although there were no developments yesterday to justify speculation. Shares
in Johnson Matthey, the metals refiner, traded quietly as the market
pondered the disclosure that Johannesburg Consolidated may bid for part of
the Matthey stake on offer from Charter Consolidated, although it is not
interested in making a full bid.
Both the UK government bond and equity markets were inclined towards caution
ahead of tomorrow's auction of Pounds 2.5bn of 8.5 per cent bonds. The
auction is expected to proceed smoothly but is likely to turn attention back
to the prospects for this year's heavy government funding programme.
At Nikko, Mr Peter Thirne comments that while he remains convinced that the
UK and US economies are recovering the FT-SE may continue to 'languish
around 2,800' until there is clearer evidence of such recovery trends. For
the end of March, however, Nikko sets a FT-SE target of 2,900.
The market's impression that the next base rate cut will be held back until
the March budget were expressed by Mr Peter Spencer at Kleinwort Benson
Securities, who commented that the 'political fallout' from last week's
depressing statistics on UK unemployment had been less than might have been
expected. 'We could be in the doldrums for another couple of months,'
suggested the Kleinwort report.

FT  26 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING, as hopes of a cut in interest rates in the short term faded,
led to a poor day in the derivatives, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, trading in the March contract on the FT-SE 100
contract began at 2,795. Dwindling hopes of an interest rate cut led to an
early sell-off which saw the contract dip to 2,786 by mid morning. It
recovered later and was trading around 2,801 by lunchtime.
However, with other European markets having a weak day, and alongside a dull
performance in the fixed interest markets, there was little in the way of
real enthusiasm for March. In the afternoon, sellers of the contract ahead
of Wednesday's treasury gilts auction returned to the fore.
At the day's low, reached around 3pm, March was trading at 2,772. The
firmness on Wall Street helped it regain some momentum and it closed at
2,780, down 23 on the previous session and around 2 points above its
estimated fair value premium of about 9. Turnover at 6,246 was poor.
Traded options business was dull with volume reaching only 21,384 lots, down
from 37,990 on Friday. The FT-SE 100 option saw 6,406 lots traded and the
Euro-FTSE 100 index 614 lots.
Among stock options, British Steel was the most active with a total of 2,474
lots and was followed by Asda at 1,834 and Sainsbury at 1,202 contracts.

FT  26 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Denmark, Finland feature in quiet week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITY markets were relatively calm last week with even the arrival of a new
US president doing little to stimulate activity, and the FT-A World index
was barely changed in local currency terms. The Pacific Rim was quiet ahead
of the Chinese New Year holidays.
In Europe, the Bundesbank's decision on Thursday not to lower interest
rates, for the time being at least, came as no surprise; but some
disappointing corporate news, particularly in France, left some markets
weak.
Lyonnaise-Dumez affected Paris as its shares lost some 14 per cent in two
days on news that 1992 profits would be down about 65 per cent on 1991.
However, the underlying strength of the market showed itself and the CAC-40
index actually showed a slight gain on the week. Some analysts believe that
hopes of lower European interest rates and the possibility of the change of
government in March is currently supporting sentiment.
Denmark and Finland showed the widest fluctuations from an otherwise average
week with, respectively, an 8 per cent rise and a 7 per cent fall in local
currency terms.
Mr Peter Tron, senior manager at Unibank in London, comments that Denmark
was encouraged throughout the week by hopes that the Social Democratic party
would be able to put together a new government. The formation was finally
agreed yesterday afternoon.
However, Mr Tron does not expect a change in the tight economic policy
pursued by the former administration, while expectations of a 'Yes' vote in
the second Maastricht referendum due in April should further encourage the
market.
Finland fell as talks between the government and opposition parties failed
to reach agreement over plans to increase funds to support the banking
sector from FM20bn (Dollars 3.7bn) to FM50bn and the HEX index slipped 5 per
cent on the week.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Porsche family to step aside
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO senior members of the Porsche family are to stand down from leading
roles on the supervisory board of the troubled sports car maker to make way
for 'an outstanding entrepreneurial personality' from the chemicals
industry, writes Christopher Parkes.
Mr Helmut Sihler, former chairman of the management board at Henkel, was
yesterday nominated as head of the Porsche supervisory board in succession
to Mr Ferdinand 'FA' Porsche, who remains a full member of the board. Mr
Sihler will also take over the board seat occupied by Mr Ferdinand 'Ferry'
Porsche, the 83-year-old son of the company's founder, who will retain a
role as honorary chairman. The changes mark a further development in the
management culture at the group, which last year posted its first loss.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch rises 30% to
Dollars 221m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Merrill Lynch, the biggest securities house in the US, rose
yesterday after the company reported a 30 per cent improvement in
fourth-quarter net income to Dollars 221.4m.
Merrill's strong final quarter, which lifted full-year 1992 profits to a
record Dollars 952.4m, goes against the grain of recent results from other
Wall Street firms, which have been reporting lower earnings for the final
three months of last year.
After a special Dollars 58.6m charge to cover changes in accounting
procedures related to post-retirement benefits, net earnings for last year
came to Dollars 893.8m, still far in excess of Merrill's previous record
year, which was 1991 when profits totalled Dollars 696.1m.
Investors responded positively to Merrill's results yesterday, with buyers
lifting the firm's shares more than Dollars 2 in early trading before a late
sell-off brought the stock back down to close at Dollars 67 7/8 , showing a
net gain of Dollars  7/8 .
A breakdown of Merrill's fourth-quarter results revealed the bulk of the
improvement in earnings came from a 50 per cent rise in net interest and
dividend profit to Dollars 287m, and a 47 per cent jump in 'other' revenues,
which included earnings from the firm's port-folio management service, and
net gains from investments.
The biggest share of Merrill's revenues pie continues to come from brokerage
commissions, which rose 5 per cent in the last quarter of 1992 to Dollars
583m as investors continued to shift their funds into equities due to low
interest rates.
Earnings from principal trading activities rose slightly to Dollars 411m.
Merrill said the trading for its own account of swaps and other derivatives,
of municipals, foreign exchange and over-the-counter securities all produced
higher revenues than last year.
In common with the rest of Wall Street, Merrill experienced a downturn in
its investment banking business, where revenues fell 4 per cent to Dollars
359m, primarily due to lower levels of debt and equity issuance by
corporations in the last few months of 1992.
Revenues from asset management and custodial fees rose 6 per cent to Dollars
210m. Over the year, client assets under fee-based management at Merrill
grew by 12 per cent to reach Dollars 138bn at year-end.
The overall increase in business volume during the quarter meant the firm's
non-interest expenses rose 6 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn. The biggest chunk of
Merrill's cost-base was taken up by employee compensation and benefits,
which rose 7 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Exxon unveils 25% increase in
fourth term

   NEW YORK

<TEXT>
EXXON, the world's biggest integrated oil company, yesterday unveiled an
unexpected 25 per cent improvement in fourth - quarter earnings, helped by
lower operating costs and strong US natural gas prices.
Net income for the last three months of 1992 was Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars
1.12 a share, against Dollars 1.12bn, or 89 cents, on revenues of Dollars
30.16bn, down from Dollars 31.02bn. Analysts had expected Exxon to earn
about 96 cents a share in the quarter.
On Wall Street, shares in Exxon rose Dollars 2 1/2 to close at Dollars 60
5/8 . The price was bolstered by news that the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries was close to agreeing to cut production by up to 1m
barrels a day.
Mr Lawrence Rawl, chairman, said three-quarters of Exxon's earnings in 1992
came from sources outside the US.
In the fourth quarter, foreign upstream earnings rose 20 per cent to Dollars
845m, including one-time credits of Dollars 56m. US upstream earnings stood
at Dollars 187m, up Dollars 30m, including one-time charges of Dollars 91m.
Exploration and production earnings climbed 19 per cent to Dollars 1.03bn
from Dollars 863m.
Lower operating expenses and higher petroleum product volumes lifted
earnings from refining and marketing operations by 61 per cent to Dollars
420m from Dollars 260m.
Earnings from chemical operations fell to Dollars 56m, including Dollars 15m
on non-recurring charges, from Dollars 94m last year. During the quarter,
Exxon slashed capital and exploration spending to Dollars 2.57bn from
Dollars 2.73bn a year earlier.
For all 1992, Exxon's net income fell 15 per cent to Dollars 4.77bn, or
Dollars 3.79, from Dollars 5.6bn or Dollars 4.45.
Exxon adopted new accounting standards in 1992 which reduced earnings by
Dollars 40m after tax, or 3 cents a share.
Operating results for the first nine months were restated to reflect the new
standards.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mercedes, BMW in talks over
possible collaboration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ is in talks with BMW over possible collaboration on parts
manufacture, according to Mr Helmut Werner, incoming chairman of the
Daimler-Benz luxury car subsidiary.
Such a development would mark a milestone in the history of both German
companies, each of which has remained among the most determinedly
independent and vertically integrated of all the world's car companies.
That such fierce rivals are contemplating direct collaboration underlines
the extreme cost pressures the entire German motor industry is now under as
a result of the strong D-Mark and high labour rates.
These pressures threaten to undermine the position of both German companies
in the all-important North American executive and luxury car market, where
they are already being outsold by Japanese luxury makes.
Mr Werner, in an interview to be published today, gives no clues, however,
as to which components might be under discussion.
He said it would be better to co-operate and try to raise volume output of
certain components. 'It would be ill-advised to try to make everything
ourselves.
'We are talking and negotiating about what we can offer one another,' Mr
Werner added.
BMW was unavailable for comment last night.
While Mercedes has relaxed its independent stance somewhat in recent years,
to the extent of buying in high-performance cylinder heads from Cosworth of
the UK and even contracting assembly of one low-volume niche model to
Porsche, BMW to date has avoided virtually all forms of collaboration. It
has even been examining manufacturing itself its own electronic components.
Its partial solution to problems in North America has also been typically
independent - setting up its own manufacturing plant in South Carolina.
Mr Werner said Mercedes' search for economies was already proving
successful. Cuts in the development and production costs for the new 190
series, the so-called 'baby Mercedes' due to be launched this summer, would
allow the car to come to market at 'aggressive' prices, he claimed.
BMW expects deliveries to distributors to fall this year for the first time
since 1974.
The setback follows progress in 1992 when BMW recorded a 4.7 per cent
increase in turnover and a 7.6 per cent rise in deliveries to 598,000 units.
However, turnover growth was hit by currency devaluations and the increased
share in sales of the cheaper 3-series. Profits, which were not disclosed,
were satisfactory, the group said in a letter to shareholders yesterday.

The changes mark a further development in the management culture at the

ago, Mr Arno Bohn was replaced as chief executive of the management board by
Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, former production chief.
They are likely to generate further speculation about Porsche's future. Mr
'Ferry' Porsche is regarded as one of the old guard, insisting Porsche
remains independent.
However, the group is tightly controlled by the founding family and the
Piech family, related by marriage, which control 100 per cent of the voting
shares and 40 per cent of the preference stocks.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Trumpf posts sharp profits fall
as demand declines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUMPF, one of Germany's biggest machine tool builders, has announced a
sharp fall in group net profits for the year ended June, due to the strength
of the D-Mark, steep rises in domestic costs and sluggish demand in its home
market.
Privately-held Trumpf, one of the world's biggest manufacturers of machines
for punching, nibbling, bending and forming sheet metal, said profits fell
to DM38.7m (Dollars 24.33m) from DM59.8m in 1990.
Worldwide turnover fell 6.2 per cent to DM677.8m - representing a relative
increase in overall market share, the company said.
Demand in Germany fell 9.2 per cent, but the company was encouraged by a
decline of only 3.4 per cent in sales by foreign subsidiaries. In
particular, US turnover rose 30 per cent, while in the UK turnover held
steady as the company increased its customer base.
Dr Berthold Leibinger, president, said: 'Too much uncertainty exists
worldwide, and although there have been some signs of hope from the US, we
cannot say whether this signals a worldwide upturn.'

group

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French power and transportation equipment company
best known for the TGV high-speed train, has opened preliminary talks aimed
at buying Deutsche Waggonbau, the large eastern German railway equipment
group.
If the negotiations between GEC Alsthom and the Treuhand privatisation
agency are successful, GEC Alsthom would gain an important foothold in the
German rail equipment market and double the size of its transport division,
which had sales of ECU1.41bn (Dollars 1.73bn) in 1991-92 and nearly 17,000
employees.
'We are very interested in DWA,' GEC Alsthom said yesterday. The
Anglo-French group makes locomotives and all types of passenger rolling
stock, while DWA makes non-powered passenger vehicles, freight wagons,
bodies and passenger coach equipment.
DWA is one of Europe's largest rail equipment manufacturers and employs more
than 16,000 people. It is one of the few enterprises in eastern Germany
recording a profit.
The company had turnover last year of DM2bn, and achieved a profit of
DM20.6m despite being forced to find new markets both in Germany and
European Community countries when trade with the countries of eastern Europe
virtually collapsed after 1990.
Until then, more than 80 per cent of DWA's exports went to east European
markets, but now over 40 per cent of its exports are sold to western German
and EC markets.
GEC Alsthom, owned jointly by GEC of the UK and France's Alcatel Alsthom,
does not face tough competition from German companies. The Federal Cartel
office has ruled out Siemens or AEG, the most obvious purchasers, from
buying DWA.
Treuhand officials had recently questioned whether it would be possible to
sell off DWA given that it had lost its large Russian market, or whether any
foreign company would want such a large concern that could not be easily
sold off in separate tranches.

TRADING in Daf, the lossmaking Dutch truckmaker, was suspended yesterday on
the Amsterdam stock exchange ahead of the unveiling today of a recovery plan
which is expected to involve the provision of further credit from the
company's bankers based on a promise of support by the Dutch state.
Daf, which declined to give any details of the plan, said it had asked the
stock exchange to suspend trading in its shares until after the plan is
released in mid-afternoon. Daf closed on Friday at Fl 7.20.
The Dutch government would not be drawn on whether it planned to take a
stake in the company as part of efforts to provide more capital. The
government already owns a small indirect stake in Daf through the chemicals
group DSM, which holds 5.9 per cent of Daf's shares and which is itself 31
per cent state-owned.
British Aerospace is Daf's biggest foreign shareholder with a stake of 10.9
per cent. Other shareholders include ABN Amro Bank, the company's 'house'
bank, and insurance companies Aegon and ING.

FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch shuts Japan
offices
</HEADLINE>

MERRILL LYNCH Japan, the local subsidiary of the US securities house, is to
close three of its six branches, ending an ambitious drive to establish a
strong presence in the Japanese securities' retail market.
The US broker, which plans to shift retail resources to its institutional
business, has suffered along with Japanese brokers from the sharp fall in
trading volume and prices on the Tokyo exchange over the past three years.
Merrill Lynch's move to close branches in Kyoto, Kobe and Yokohama is part
of a restructuring of Japanese operations by foreign brokerages. Last month,
County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster Bank, gave up
membership on the Tokyo exchange.
Individual investors have been net sellers for the past two years in Japan,
while non-financial companies have left the market in large numbers,
draining the pool of potential customers which Merrill Lynch had hoped to
tap.
'This is the end of the retail experiment by foreign houses in Japan,' a UK
broker said. 'You can see why Merrill would go for the retail market here
because it is strong in the US retail market, but it has not worked.'
In addition to operations in the three largest Japanese cities, Tokyo, Osaka
and Nagoya, the US broker opened the Yokohama branch in 1988, the Kyoto
branch in 1989, and the Kobe branch in 1991, by which time the Tokyo market
was well into its descent.
Merrill Lynch said the changes in Japan were part of an international
strategy to focus on institutional-type investors and profit from their
interest in the derivatives and yen-debt markets.
'We are still deciding exactly when the branches will be closed. We had been
hoping for more business from small and mid-sized companies and wealthy
individuals, but we will be shifting resources more to institutional
business,' Merrill Lynch said.
Tokyo stock prices fell 26.4 per cent last year, while the daily average
volume on the exchange's first section was 264.9m shares, the lowest since
1977 and a quarter that of the bubble year of 1988. Trading volumes are
still falling, with an estimated 170m shares traded yesterday.
A European broker said Merrill Lynch got the timing wrong, as it was
expanding as the market was contracting. Another foreign broker
congratulated Merrill Lynch for its retreat from the retail market, saying
it had taken the sort of decision that lossmaking Japanese brokers had
avoided.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Siemens keen to acquire GEC's 60% stake in
GPT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, is eager to buy from
GEC the 60 per cent stake in GPT it does not already own, but so far the UK
company has shown no willingness to sell.
Neither Siemens nor GEC would comment yesterday on reports that the German
company had offered Lord Weinstock up to Pounds 800m for GEC's share in the
telecommunications equipment maker.
GPT, which last year made Pounds 127m in pre-tax profits, was formed through
the merging of the telecommunications manufacturing interests of GEC and
Plessey. It has been jointly owned by GEC and Siemens since 1989 when the
two companies successfully made a bid for Plessey.
Siemens' UK operations were profitable last year but if the contribution
from GPT is excluded, the UK subsidiary was in loss.
Mr Jurgen Gehrels, chief executive of Siemens UK, last week said that the
price paid for Plessey had been too high because the company had been bought
when the market was buoyant.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Allders may return to market in autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLDERS, the department store and duty free company which was taken private
after a Pounds 224m buy-out from Hanson in 1989, is considering returning to
the stock market, possibly in the autumn.
No timetable for the possible flotation has been fixed, and the company is
now recruiting a stockbroker and other advisers. Schroders, which arranged a
1991 financial restructuring for the company, is likely to be retained as
financial adviser.
The restructuring, prompted by poor trading conditions and a looming debt
repayment peak, included a Pounds 10m injection of fresh equity,
underwritten by Prudential Venture Managers, 3i and CIN Venture Managers.
Following the 1989 buy-out, Allders said it wanted to return to the stock
market within four years to use the proceeds of the flotation to pay off
borrowings.
Allders operates 11 UK department stores and claims to be the world's second
largest duty free retailer, after Duty Free Shoppers of the US.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Re-routed via the Stock Exchange - James
Buxton on the proposed flotation of Stagecoach Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE river Tay burst its banks last week and flooded the offices in
Perth of Stagecoach Holdings, Mr Brian Souter, chairman and chief executive,
waded in, rolled up his sleeves and shifted documents and equipment up the
narrow staircase to the first floor.
Though Mr Souter now runs a company which employs 11,000 people and turned
over Pounds 140m last year, he is a hands-on manager who on occasions still
takes the wheel of one of the 3,300 buses which the company operates in
Britain and overseas.
Stagecoach is seeking a Stock Exchange quotation in April which could value
the company at some Pounds 100m, a development which Mr Souter sees as a
natural progression for a business which he and his sister began with a
handful of buses in 1980.
The story of Stagecoach is a lesson in the application of private enterprise
to the often hidebound world of public transport. It has lessons for the
privatisation of British Rail - indeed last year it became the first private
company to operate a regular passenger train service by attaching carriages
to BR trains.
Stagecoach began when Mr Souter, a chartered accountant with Arthur
Andersen, and his sister, Mrs Ann Gloag, then a nurse, began a long-distance
coach operation between Dundee and London, undercutting the established
Scottish Bus group operation. Their father was bus driver in Perth.
The company's big expansion came when the National Bus Company was broken up
and privatised after 1985. Stagecoach bought bus companies in Hampshire,
Cumbria and the east Midlands.
It then made further acquisitions among companies which had staged
management buy-outs from National Bus Company whose managements, Mr Souter
says, 'had exhausted themselves in the MBO process,' and also acquired three
Scottish bus companies, two of them from the privatisation of the Scottish
Bus Group.
In each purchase the Stagecoach team acted as a catalyst, Mr Souter says,
'releasing energy which was buried there among the middle management.' The
company cut out tiers of management, re-examined routes, introduced a
variety of sizes of buses, as well as investing heavily in new fleets and
agreeing productivity deals with the labour force.
For a time the company benefited from sales of property acquired in
privatisation. In one case it acquired the bus station in Keswick at a book
value of Pounds 55,000 and sold it for Pounds 705,000. In another it sold
the bus station in Whitehaven for Pounds 1.1m, having paid Pounds 165,000.
Twice Stagecoach has had to comply with recommendations of the Office of
Fair Trading to divest itself of acquisitions considered to be posing a
threat to competition. Profit margins have been pushed up from the 5 per
cent of turnover which Stagecoach says was being achieved under National Bus
Company to between 10 and 15 per cent.
Stagecoach now has a geographical spread from the south of England to the
north of Scotland, giving some insulation from economic downturns in any
single area. Its buses are painted in a single livery and can be transferred
from one area to another to meet fluctuations in demand.
The company has also applied its formula to bus companies in Kenya, Malawi
and New Zealand, where the authorities have chosen the privatisation route.
Stagecoach even operates buses in China, paid for with the proceeds of
advertisements on their sides.
In 1992 Stagecoach's pre-tax profits reached Pounds 8.2m, compared with
Pounds 2.5m in 1991, on turnover which rose from Pounds 103.3m to Pounds
140.7m.
The flotation, Mr Souter says, will give the company the resources it needs
for further expansion. About 35 municipal bus companies in England are due
for privatisation in the next year or two and the government is to privatise
the London Buses.
The franchising of British Rail services is an obvious opportunity to be
looked at, though the overnight service between Scotland and London which
Stagecoach launched last year failed to attract enough passengers and has
been scaled down.
Though Noble Grossart, Stagecoach's Edinburgh merchant banker, is sponsoring
the share issue and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew has been appointed stockbroker, no
details are being disclosed, though it is likely to be worth about Pounds
100m.
Of Stagecoach's 21m issued ordinary shares, Mr Souter, 38, owns 9.1m and his
sister Mrs Gloag, the 50-year-old managing director, owns 8.7m. Eight
Scottish institutions hold convertible cumulative preference shares worth
Pounds 5m under a formula which was to give them between 16 and 25 per cent
of the ordinary shares.
Mr Souter evidently co-operates happily with his sister. While he provides
the ideas, she runs the administration and negotiates some hard bargains
with bus manufacturers and bulk fuel suppliers.
On Sundays they go to the evangelical church of the Nazarene, where Mr
Souter is an occasional preacher.

FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lookers 'off the bottom' as margins recover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOKERS, the Manchester-based motor dealer, was again affected by recession
in the year to the end of September but has started to see signs of
recovery.
Mr Ken Martindale, chairman, said sales in the first quarter of the current
year were 'somewhat higher' than the 14 per cent increase reported by the
motor industry. He said margins, which have been depressed by stock
overhangs and manufacturers selling nearly new cars, started to recover in
December and have maintained the trend this month.
'We're certainly off the bottom,' he said.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 3.21m to Pounds 1.81m in the year to
September 30 as a result of volume and margin losses. Turnover dropped from
Pounds 359.6m to Pounds 332.7m.
Mr Martindale said gearing had fallen from 115 per cent to a little less
than 100 per cent, of which half was held in the contract hire division.
Looker was proposing to sell 51 per cent of that operation to Woodchester
Credit Lyonnais, a subsidiary of Woodchester Investments, for between Pounds
1.52m and Pounds 1.77m. Proceeds would be used to reduce borrowings.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 146,000 to cover the costs of
closing a subsidiary after the year end.
Earnings fell from 2.1p to 0.9p. The directors decided to maintain the final
dividend at 4.2p for an unchanged total of 6.2p, on the grounds of prospects
for recovery and the expected fall in gearing.
