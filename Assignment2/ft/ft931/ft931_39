FT  23 JAN 93 / The good, the bad, the uncertain: Hopes of recovery in the
UK economy have given way to a familiar picture of mixed economic indicators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's chancellor of the exchequer has a way with words.
Last Sunday, Mr Norman Lamont popped up on television to announce that there
were 'many encouraging signs' of improvement in the UK economy.
By yesterday - after news of falling retail sales in December, declining
industrial output in November and the sharp jump in unemployment to just
under 3m - it was beginning to look as if accident prone Mr Lamont had
fallen back into the trap of seeing green shoots of recovery where none
exists.
The truth is, as ever, more complicated. To set against this week's gloomy
data, the Treasury could point to strong car sales in December, robust
growth in recent months of cash and bank notes in circulation, and a rebound
in business confidence since sterling's departure from the European exchange
rate mechanism on Black Wednesday.
Whitehall also took comfort from reports of increased house sales in
December, although house prices as measured by the Halifax and Nationwide
building societies continued to fall last month. Not all mortgage payers
have yet benefited from the sharp 3 percentage point fall in bank base rates
to 7 per cent since September because some building societies, which adjust
their mortgage rates annually, have still to respond to the cut in the cost
of borrowing. This could mean that a further stimulus to demand is in the
pipeline, holding out the prospect of some future growth.
But no amount of accentuating the positive could alter the fact that the
strong hopes of a turnaround - symbolised by the rush of shoppers to the
sales immediately after Christmas - had given way to the familiar pattern of
mixed and usually depressing signals that has characterised the UK economy
for the past two years.
Economic recoveries are typically patchy. That this applies within sectors
as well as across the economy was highlighted by Tuesday's distributive
trades survey from the Confederation of British Industry, which found that
large retailers did well in December while smaller companies employing fewer
than 100 did poorly.
But Britain's recession has been so long and so severe that special factors
may be making recent trends particularly difficult to interpret.
Many economists have been puzzled about the recent strength of demand for
big ticket items such as cars or durable household goods at a time of
depressed demand for consumer credit, generally weak consumer confidence and
rising unemployment.
One explanation is that people in work have been avoiding new borrowing
commitments after the traumas caused by high interest rates in the late
1980s and using their savings to buy carefully selected bargains at a
discount.
But Mr Leo Doyle, UK economist at Kleinwort Benson, the City investment
bank, suggests that some of the newly unemployed may also be helping to
support this spending. His theory is that they are using redundancy payments
and running down savings with a view to obtaining means-tested benefits such
as the monthly mortgage interest payments.
The Department of Social Security has rules to prevent such behaviour. But
that does not mean the practice does not take place. Furthermore, some large
purchases such as the replacement of a company car with a new family car
would conform with DSS rules.
There are also doubts about how much reliance to place on business
confidence indicators. Over the past month, surveys from the Institute of
Directors, Dun &amp; Bradstreet and the British Chambers of Commerce have
pointed to a recovery in business confidence in the final quarter of last
year. Sterling's devaluation and the interest rate cuts have gone some way
to offsetting the gloom felt by business during the September currency
crisis.
But it is a moot point how far such increases in confidence reflect improved
business conditions. Confidence surveys ask about the future, looking ahead
a quarter in the case of Dun &amp; Bradstreet and 12 months in the case of the
chambers of commerce.
According to Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering Employers
Federation, businessmen may be anticipating when they respond to surveys.
'People want to think the recovery is here,' he says. 'Many members are
receptive to the idea that we may have the fundamentals in place to come out
of recession. But they are not yet seeing recovery in terms of orders or
cheques in the post.'
If true, such indicators are clearly a fragile base for hopes of recovery,
which is one reason why December's sharply higher unemployment caused such
concern.
The official government figures came immediately after the British Chambers
of Commerce reported that both the manufacturing and service industries
expected to continue shedding labour in the first three months of this year,
According to Mr Christopher Stewart-Smith, the BCC president, the prospect
of rising unemployment constitutes a downside risk for the economy which
could adversely influence sentiment more than any optimism deriving from
increased exports following sterling's devaluation.
Even before Thursday, economists such as Mr Sudhir Junankar of the CBI, were
warning that sentiment was in the balance and that there was no reason to
expect the economy to turn up before the spring. The past week's statistics
have increased fears that rising unemployment in the months ahead will chill
these limited hopes and could trigger a downward spiral of falling
confidence, reduced demand and still higher unemployment.
The stage has therefore been set for an intensified debate about the future
direction of economic policy in the seven and a half weeks to the Budget on
March 16. Already, many City economists and members of the Treasury's
recently constituted panel of seven independent economists have been calling
for interest rate cuts to boost growth.
One factor that could influence the debate is the obvious disenchantment of
Mr John Major, the prime minister, with the ERM. With Britain set to stay
outside the ERM for a year at least, some of the government's advisers in
the Bank of England and the Treasury may be inclined to cast envious eyes
across the Atlantic at the US experience, where sharply lower interest rates
appear to have triggered a recovery without sparking inflation.
Advocates of lower UK interest rates argue that there is little risk of
activating the traditional spiral of rising costs and wages because higher
unemployment is exerting downward pressure on pay. According to UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew, the City investment house, pay settlements in the UK are currently
averaging 3.25 per cent.
On the other hand, the Bank will be advising the government that Britain
cannot risk pushing short-term rates down to US-type levels of about 3 per
cent for fear of causing a sharp fall in sterling which would boost
inflation through higher imported goods' prices.
There is a growing mood in the City that 5 per cent base rates are needed to
boost the economy. But any speculation about an early and substantial cut in
rates would seem to be premature.
The government may want to wait for another month's economic data, the Bank
of England's first quarterly assessment of UK inflationary pressures, which
is due to be published next month, and the budget itself.
Before this week's bad news, Mr Lamont insisted that he had only limited
room for manoeuvre if the government was to keep within its target range for
underlying inflation of 1 to 4 per cent during the life of this parliament.
Having made much of his dogged struggle to bring inflation down from nearly
11 per cent, it is unlikely that the week's developments will have persuaded
him to change his mind.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Letter: Lunch for a fiver feeds southern 'skimps'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The FT Lunch for a Fiver is a great idea.
If lunch was 'only for wimps' in the 1980s - then lunch in the 1990s must be
only for skimps] However, I do believe that there are deeper social
implications to be drawn from the scheme than simply a creative way of
filling empty covers after the Christmas 'festivities'.
Why are more than 90 per cent of the restaurants in the 071 and 081
telephone areas? Has the great north/south barrier fallen to such an extent
that we now need to subsidise our starving brothers in the south?
Or is it simply a case that restaurants in the provinces have been slow to
catch on to a good idea? In which case . . . southern entrepreneurs are
still alive and kicking]
Before angry restaurateurs write in claiming to be 'on the ball', I should
point out that it is usually possible to obtain a reasonable lunch for under
a fiver in most parts of Brit-ain, but . . . come on lads, free publicity is
worth something]
I feel that this important social issue needs to be addressed. In the
meantime, I shall sweep the crumbs off my desk, having had a working lunch
costing Pounds 2.50, and get on with the business] Gordon Gecko, where are
you now?

FT  23 JAN 93 / Letter: Maternity leave that makes sense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CHRISTINE GOWDRIDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The National Audit Office report published this week (Errors found in
sick-pay scheme, January 20) showed the problems employers are having with a
complicated scheme. Almost one in three of the cases of statutory maternity
pay examined was inaccurate.
Unfortunately, it is going to get more complicated. The Trade Union Reform
and Employment Rights Bill introduces 14 weeks maternity leave for all
women.
Add this to the existing right to return to work up to 29 weeks after
childbirth, 18 weeks pay, six weeks at 90 per cent of income for women
fulfilling the service requirement and 18 weeks at a flat rate for the rest,
and you can begin to see how excessively complex it is likely to become.
A far better fit with existing provision would be achieved by granting all
women 18, not 14, weeks leave. Before you shout 'It'll cost too much', just
think about it.
There would be no additional recruitment or training costs if you already
have a temporary replacement. Women will be returning when they and their
babies are fitter. Contractual rights would be extended for the additional
four weeks, but good employers are doing this anyway.
The Maternity Alliance will be working hard as the Bill goes through
parliament to convince employers and the organisations representing them
that 18 weeks maternity leave makes sense for mothers, babies and employers.
Would you like to help?

FT  23 JAN 93 / Charity begins in the boardroom: Alan Pike looks at the
successors to the Victorian philanthropists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Central Statistical Office does not publish a National Generosity Guide.
There is therefore no league table of philanthropy in which to measure this
week's donation by David Sainsbury of Pounds 200m-worth of shares to the
Gatsby Charitable Foundation.
Not all donations like the Sainsbury shares become public knowledge through
their declaration to the Stock Exchange or publication in trust accounts.
Some benefactors adhere strictly to the biblical injunction to avoid
announcing their good deeds with a flourish of trumpets.
By all standards, however, the Sainsbury Pounds 200m is breathtaking for a
single donation: it is at least four or five times the annual income from
all sources of many large household name charities, such as the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund, the Royal National Institute for the Blind and the
Spastics Society.
The figure is Pounds 11.5m more than the combined expenditure on
fund-raising of Britain's 400 biggest charities during 1991. It eclipses the
amounts raised by the most high-profile national broadcast appeals - in 1991
the most successful, the BBC's Children in Need campaign, produced Pounds
26.8m.
It even cuts down to size the Pounds 32m given by financier George Soros in
December to aid organisations in Bosnia-Hercegovina, believed to be the
largest single donation by an individual to a humanitarian cause, and
derived from the money he made from currency speculation.
Charitable activity by successful business figures, of course, is not new.
Most Victorian industrial cities have libraries, universities, art
galleries, housing or hospitals that originated from the contributions of
local industrialists.
Philanthropy was closer to the ground in those days, when industrialists
lived in the towns and cities they endowed and had their factories there.
One of the present difficulties with efforts to generate business support
for deprived urban areas is that most companies now have their head offices
in London, and senior directors do not have the same strong links with
provincial communities as they did a century ago.
But the spirit of philanthropic employers like Joseph Rowntree continues in
charitable trusts bearing their names today, while the establishment of
trusts by more recent business figures continues. Gatsby is one of several
Sainsbury family charitable trusts. It was set up by David Sainsbury in 1967
and, even before his injection of the Pounds 200m worth of shares this week,
had become one of Britain's largest grant-making trusts. It supports health
and social welfare projects, technical education, industrial and economic
programmes, scientific research and development of the third world.
Support by British companies remains modest in relation to the charity
sector's Pounds 16bn total annual income. Last year, 48 companies gave more
than Pounds 1m each in cash or in kind to charity. Far more of it was in
kind - staff secondments, free use of office space and equipment - than in
cash, with only 22 companies making financial donations of Pounds 1m or
more.
This is no indication of how much individual directors give out of their own
pockets. The government's Gift Aid scheme provides tax advantages on one-off
donations in excess of Pounds 400, and the average individual gift is just
over Pounds 2,000.
There are, however, much bigger gifts than this awaiting collection by
charities, if they know how to solicit them. Since Oxford University
launched its Campaign for Oxford to strengthen its finances in 1988, it has
raised Pounds 237m of its Pounds 340m target. Although the Pounds 237m
contains income from sources such as research funds, it also includes 24
donations to the campaign of more than Pounds 1m each.
The university does not simply telephone wealthy people and ask if they can
spare Pounds 1m. Researchers work carefully on the business background of
potential donors and offer arrangements of mutual interest to their
companies and the university - the going rate for the permanent endowment of
a professorship is Pounds 1.7m.
As well as providing an example of carefully planned and targeted
fund-raising, Oxford's campaign also highlights the issues at the heart of
an increasingly anxious debate about the proper function of charity.
Some dons were apprehensive about the campaign, because they believed it
implied acceptance of the view that universities need not be adequately
supported from public funds. Charity managers are even more apprehensive, as
universities, trust hospitals and other public sector institutions
increasingly compete with them for limited funds.
Envious outsiders say the Oxford campaign has been helped by the
university's ancient, establishment image - corporate donors frequently shy
away from unpopular or controversial causes.
A survey by the Charities Aid Foundation, one of the main sources of
information on the voluntary sector, shows that educational charities do
best from corporate donors - receiving 35 per cent of total cash donations -
followed by medicine and health. Civil rights organisations do least well,
coming below animal welfare to pick up only 0.08 per cent of corporate
financial support - a total of just Pounds 34,000 last year.
There are, however, some interesting attempts to redress the balance. In
1985 J Paul Getty II, the millionaire US citizen who lives in Britain, set
up a trust with Pounds 20m, as one of his many charitable activities. The
policy of the J Paul Getty Charitable Trust is to support unpopular causes
that would otherwise have difficulty finding finance. Drug and alcohol
projects, the mentally ill and handicapped, ex-offenders and Aids victims
have been among the beneficiaries.
'The trust funds so many interesting things that adjectives to describe them
become a bit redundant,' enthuses the Directory of Social Change, the
voluntary sector specialist publisher, in its Guide to the Major Trusts,
published this week.
'The new thoughts about prisons give more opportunities to encourage
imaginative schemes,' says the Getty trust in its annual report.
'Hard-pressed estates with high unemployment and poverty can be
revolutionised by dedicated people . . . There is also concern about the
number of very young women having babies without support.'
A trust such as Getty's, at a time when public-sector support for voluntary
organisation working is such fields is being cut, shows that there are true
contemporary successors to the Victorian philanthropists.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Letter: Welcome criticism of leases that cause pain and
expense
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER CORMACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Bank of England's criticism of the structure of English commercial
leases is more than welcome, but indeed some decades too late ('Commercial
lease provisions criticised by Bank', January 21).
Upward only rent reviews, and the legal jargon in which lengthy leases are
couched, have proved to be a blank cheque for both agents and solicitors for
many years past, while rents are reviewed and argued and lease addenda are
prepared, both nearly always at the expense and pain of the tenant.
Surely the time has come for England to learn very quickly from its younger
overseas cousins where commercial leases consist of a four-page preprinted
form (blank spaces to be filled in) written in readily understandable plain
layman's English. Commercial leases can be for any agreed period but usually
three years, with renewals thereafter at agreed market rentals for whatever
extension period is agreed between the landlord and tenant. UK developers,
landlords, agents and solicitors have had it too good for too long milking
the business community. The time is ripe for commercial property tenants to
say 'enough is enough']

FT  23 JAN 93 / Letter: Casualties of gambling must not be ignored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIRGAY SANGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, David Spanier, in his article 'Britain joins in a game once deemed a
sin' (January 9), omits the central point about expanding the availability
of gambling. It is, that the more people who gamble, and the greater the
frequency, the more casualties occur from this activity. There is
unquestioned evidence that the incidence of compulsive gambling is directly
related to states and provinces where it is introduced. That a government
would promote such an activity is no different from a government promoting
the drinking of alcohol or the smoking of cigarettes.
Furthermore, it has also been shown that the people who wager are the ones
most vulnerable - single males on the fringe of society, minorities, late
adolescents and young adults. And, still further, that gambling is a form of
regressive taxation on this group.
It is not responsible journalism for you to have omitted reference to the
many epidemiological and sociological studies found in the Journal of
Gambling Behavior. It goes without saying that any government which fosters
such 'risky' activity without generous provision for researching the human
damage and offering treatment, is not a government of the people.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Europe's hairshirt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THURSDAY this week, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister of Europe's most
powerful country, went as a supplicant to Frankfurt. His purpose was to
plead with the high priests of monetary stability in their temple. There, he
offered his 'solidarity pact' and begged in return for lower interest rates.
But the priests of monetary stability respond to such questions as
cryptically as those who once served at Delphi. The millions who also want
what Mr Waigel sought can only wait and pray.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank's vice-president, has insisted that the
Bundesbank will cut interest rates to the extent it thinks this justifiable.
Who can doubt him? The Bundesbank is powerful, but it is not arbitrary. The
question is when it will believe further interest rates cuts are justified.
Will this be as soon and will they then go as far as the German government
hopes, not to mention the French, the Irish, the Danish and all the rest?
The questions are urgent, notwithstanding the insistence of European finance
ministers at their meeting this week that the crisis in the ERM is past.
Immediate pressure for realignment of the currencies that have been most
under pressure - the Irish punt, the Danish krone and the French franc - did
dwindle, as the D-Mark weakened against the dollar. But ministers are
declaring the battle over too soon.
They are over-optimistic because they forget the ever gloomier prospects for
EC economic growth. Only this week the European Commission cut its forecast
for EC economic growth from 1992 to 1993 to 0.8 per cent. Notwithstanding
this reduction in the forecast, which is not likely to be the last, Mr
Henning Christopherson, the commissioner in charge of economics, insisted
that recent speculation against the ERM had been unwarranted. He was wrong.
It is the EC's poor growth prospects which makes the speculation not merely
warranted, but inevitable.
Inevitable
The UK has been expected to be among the better performing EC economies this
year. So indeed it should be. But none of the news released this week shows
it will be. Seasonally adjusted unemployment was up 61,000 in the month to
December 1992; manufacturing output was down  1/2 per cent in the three
months to November as against the previous three months; and seasonally
adjusted retail sales fell in December. Fortunately, since what is now known
as White Wednesday, the government is no longer nailed to the Bundesbank's
cross. Lower interest rates are inevitable. The government should bow to
that reality sooner rather than later.
Meanwhile, the EC's so-called fast lane countries are going into reverse.
Even the French economy, the most virtuous of all, is widely forecast to
achieve little growth this year. Unless the Bundesbank lowers interest rates
not only soon, which seems possible, but by at least 2 percentage points,
which seems much less likely, France may experience a fifth successive year
of sub- potential economic growth in 1994.
Uncomfortable
French inflation is down to a 36-year annual low of 2 per cent. If policy
persists, it could fall below zero, but unemployment would also continue to
rise. Fortunately for the French government, both the actual one and the one
likely to be in office after the general election, 72 per cent of the French
people appears to favour the franc fort policy. That would seem to make
continued wearing of the monetary hair shirt conceivable, however
uncomfortable.
It is Germany, battling with the aftermath of unification, that is the
source of Europe's problems. The German economics ministry now forecasts
that the west German economy will shrink 1 per cent this year. It is almost
certainly too optimistic, largely because Bundesbank economists do not share
the government's concerns.
The answer to all the government's problems is supposed to be the solidarity
pact, whose fiscal component has been offered by Mr Waigel on the
Bundesbank's altar. Yet economists at the DIW in Berlin argued only this
week that the pact would fail to pull the east German economy out of
recession. They must be right, when engineering workers are expecting, like
lemmings, to rush over the cliff of a 26 per cent wage increase this March.
That Germany is so far failing to cope with the huge challenge of
unification is obvious. What is not so obvious is why most of the rest of
the EC thinks it wise to be overwhelmed too. Unification is, it turns out,
precisely the kind of real economic shock that requires substantial changes
in real exchange rates. Since the EC refused - and, for the most part,
continues to refuse - to make those changes through the nominal exchange
rate, it has had to accept inflation in Germany and deflation everywhere
else instead.
Germany may yet make a big success of unification. Most of the EC may yet
move smoothly to economic and monetary union. Neither now looks very likely.
The EC is paying a high price for its attachment to exchange rate rigidity.

There are not many people who can say of the 42nd president of the United
States, as Mack McLarty did on Thursday morning: 'In many ways, Bill Clinton
is the same person he was in kindergarten.' Nor be quick enough to realise
that he should not give the impression that the Oval Office is now inhabited
by a five-year-old. 'That's not to suggest he hasn't matured and grown
wiser,' was his next sentence.
Washington this week was filled to the rafters with FOBs (friends of Bill),
all members of the extraordinary number of overlapping networks the Clintons
have maintained over the years. But Thomas F McLarty, known as Mack, is the
only BOF (Bill's oldest friend). Both 46, they go all the way back to Miss
Mary's kindergarten in Hope, Arkansas. Now William J Clinton, still called
Bill, has turned to Mack to help him in Washington as the White House chief
of staff.
There is, potentially, no more sensitive job in the capital. Exactly how it
is performed depends on the wishes and needs of the president, and each has
had his different requirements. But even a breezy look at recent history
shows how much the chief of staff can make or break a president.
Probably the most successful in the past 20 years was James Baker in Ronald
Reagan's first term who ran a tight but not leak-proof ship. Above all, he
protected his president from situations in which he might be caught
off-guard.
Another Baker, Howard, the former senator from Tennessee, also did well as a
damage control operator when Mr Reagan's final years turned sour. Dick
Cheney, later a congressman from Wyoming and the just-departed defence
secretary, was a great help to President Gerald Ford in a difficult period.
Better remembered are the failures: H R Haldeman, who pandered to all
Richard Nixon's darker instincts and paid for it with a prison term:
Hamilton Jordan, whose contempt for the Washington establishment did no
favours to an outsider president, Jimmy Carter: and two of President Bush's
chiefs of staff, John Sununu, fiercely ideological and personally abrasive,
and Sam Skinner, who never realised until too late that his boss was in deep
political doo-doo.
His friendship with his president apart, McLarty comes to Washington
probably the least known of the new Clinton team. The son of a successful
car dealer and University of Arkansas graduate, he embarked on a political
career early and, at 23, became the youngest ever state assemblyman. But his
father's failing health brought him to the family firm, where he did well
enough developing its leasing business that, still only 30, he was elected
to the board of Arkla, the natural gas utility. Seven years later he was its
president, replacing Sheffield Nelson, who was to become Mr Clinton's arch
political rival, and two years on its chairman and CEO.
He inherited a company in crisis, afflicted by declining oil prices, mild
winters, and expensive long-term pipeline contracts. By the mid-80s Arkla's
debt far exceeded its net worth. By 1989, its stock price had dropped 70 per
cent and its credit rating was dubious. It is still not out of the woods
even after an extensive disposal of assets, and McLarty's chairmanship is
not without its critics.
One acquisition, of a Houston natural gas company which may still be liable
for the debts of a local savings and loan it owned before being taken over,
leaves Arkla with a potentially high and still disputed charge. But McLarty
gets general credit in the industry for keeping it afloat, and it was still
in the charts as the 47th-largest utility in the most recent 1991 rankings
of service companies by the Fortune 500.
But his record as a businessman is not why he was the first person named by
Mr Clinton to a Washington job.
The explanation lies in Arkansas, which, to repeat the ultimate cliche,
really is a small state where everybody who is anybody knows everybody else.
Though out of elective state politics for more than 20 years, the chairman
of one of its biggest companies is a de facto intimate of every politician,
not least its governor. Sometimes this has presented problems for McLarty,
as in 1990 when he remained conspicuously neutral in the governor's race
between Clinton and Sheffield Nelson. But this never harmed his relationship
with the Clintons. He was a discreet intimate throughout last year's
campaign and a big fund-raiser.
All the Arkansas references are glowing, from friend and foe alike, though
he seems to have few enemies. He is universally described as methodical,
intelligent and, above all, gracious. His television performances in the new
limelight this week certainly showed his quiet charm. They also disclosed a
canny skill at saying nothing in the nicest possible manner.
He has talked a little, however, about his role as chief of staff. He does
not see himself as a gatekeeper or high profile operator, which means he may
have been seen more on TV in the first two days of this administration than
in the next two years.
The key, as he told the Washington Post recently, is: 'I really believe that
Bill and I are not going to have any trouble talking straight to each other.
We've done that for years and it flows very smoothly. He wants it. That was
one of the real elements he felt was needed.'
Mrs Clinton is getting an office in the political west wing of the White
House rather than the social east wing, and will be a power in developing
healthcare policy. McLarty's view is: 'Hillary's a good friend, too, someone
I really greatly admire.' He even discreetly allowed that there were some
differences between the approaches of the president and his influential
wife. 'The linear style of thinking (reaching a decision and pushing ahead
with the next item on the agenda) might be more Hillary's style and my
style.'
So Mack McLarty begins his capital odyssey with a clean sheet and the
complete trust of the man who is president, but as a relative innocent in a
city with many more snakes than ladders - one of which Zoe Baird failed to
climb this week. He also has a fear of flying, but, then, there is much to
do without leaving the ground in Washington.

FT  23 JAN 93 / We're in for a bumpy ride: The privatisation of British Rail
poses unique problems and is fraught with difficulty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a long time coming. For years, on and off, successive
Conservative governments have been talking about the possibility of
privatising British Rail. Yesterday, at last, the bill that will make this
possible appeared. But just what does railway privatisation mean?
The passenger could be forgiven for being confused. The government white
paper, New Opportunities for the Railways, that came out last July was
subtitled The Privatisation of British Rail. But as we entered the new year,
the prime minister described the process as 'semi-privatisation' and Mr John
MacGregor, the transport secretary, followed up by developing a predilection
for the word 'commercialisation'. Ministers denied gleeful Labour
accusations of a U-turn: but amid the complexity of the government's
proposals, it is not surprising that the public's understanding of what is
really going to happen to its railways is at a low ebb.
One thing that is plain about the privatisation of BR is that it will be
like no other Britain has yet seen. Previous privatisations have typically
involved the disposal of industries and utilities to the private sector
through trade sales or stock market flotations. But this never looked
feasible with BR. Loss-making on a big scale - last year it lost nearly
Pounds 1bn - it would have been impossible to value, still less to sell. Who
would have wanted to buy it?
Having wrestled with a number of options for breaking up BR into smaller
units, the government still kept coming up against the same problem.
Whichever way you split the railway, there was no getting rid of the losses
 -not, at least, without big cuts in services, large fare rises, or both.
So, instead, it switched tack and looked at ways of involving the private
sector through the contracting out of train operations, just as if they were
hospital cleaning or rubbish collection services.
And that, in essence, is what this privatisation amounts to. True, BR's
freight operations are to be sold off - the government sees no reason to
protect loss-making freight, and the profit-making operations can fend for
themselves. But that is all that is going to be sold.
So far as the rest of British Rail is concerned, it is to be split into two.
One part, to be named Railtrack, will retain the tracks and infrastructure,
and start charging for their use. The other will continue to operate the
passenger trains, but these services will gradually be contracted out to the
private sector on the basis of which company is prepared to pay the highest
price for the franchise - or rather, since the majority of services are
unprofitable, on the basis of which company requires the smallest subsidy.
There is just one more wrinkle. Obsessed with the idea of maximising
competition, and embittered by the experience of privatisations such as
British Gas, where competition has been slow to emerge, the government is
also requiring open access to the tracks. In other words, any company
wanting to introduce a new freight or passenger service in competition with
existing ones will theoretically be able to do so - though this is unlikely
to take place on any widespread scale, given the shortage of vacant slots on
BR's busiest routes.
Put in these terms, privatisation may not sound such a troubling prospect.
And yet the government's plans have been attacked from almost every quarter
 -by politicians, consumer groups, trade unions, professional institutions,
the public transport lobby and the very companies the government is hoping
will participate.
Roughly speaking, the criticisms fall into two main categories. Those in the
first category say that the government's plans just will not work. So do
those in the second category; but they go on to suggest that, even if the
plans do work, the result will be to passengers' disadvantage.
The criticisms in the first category have been better rehearsed than those
in the second. To take a few examples:
The government's insistence on open access will kill off private-sector
interest in franchising because franchisees' most profitable services will
be vulnerable to attack by cherry-picking marauders.
Dividing the responsibility for track and trains makes no sense because it
will leave too high a proportion of the train operator's costs under the
control of state-owned Railtrack, which will have no incentive to act
efficiently.
The government's insistence that Railtrack must make a positive return on
its assets will result in its imposing track charges so high as to price
traffic off the railways and on to the roads.
The complex bureaucracy involved in the relationship between the government,
the rail regulator, the franchising authority, Railtrack, the BR residuary
body, the Health and Safety Commission and the private-sector train
operators will prove impossibly unwieldy.
The first two of these have already been answered, at least in part. Earlier
this week the government made a significant concession by acknowledging that
it would have to deny open access in some franchise areas to persuade the
private sector to get involved. It also said it was prepared to franchise
the tracks as well as the trains on some routes.
Criticisms of the track-charging regime are more difficult to answer because
the government has yet to publish its proposals for track charges. As for
the bureaucracy: well, that is just one of the unfortunate side-effects of
trying to combine a competitive railway with a safe and reliable one, and it
remains to be seen how offputting it proves in practice.
But never mind the danger that privatisation will never happen, BR's
passengers could say: the worst that can happen is that BR will simply go on
running the trains. What we want to know is what will happen if
privatisation does happen. How will we be affected? Will our trains still
run? Will fares soar?
Passengers appear to have genuine grounds for concern about the government's
plans - many of them centring on the possible consequences of the
fragmentation of the national passenger railway into a patchwork of
independently operated franchises.
A simple example is the national railway timetable. Admittedly, this is not
one of Britain's best-selling publications: most railway passengers travel
to and fro on a single route and have no need to know what other services BR
offers. Nevertheless, it is useful for the minority of passengers who travel
more widely, and looks a probable casualty of the government's privatisation
plans.
As for railway services, most should be safe from closure. Franchisees will
still be receiving subsidies to operate loss-making services, so companies
will not be able to drop them willy-nilly. When awarding franchises, the
franchising authority will specify minimum levels and standards of services,
and these seem likely to be no worse than those already being operated by
BR, at least initially.
Even so, some rural services could come under scrutiny. Take, for example,
the line from Inverness to Wick in the far north of Scotland - a 161-mile
railway carrying only three trains daily each way. With Railtrack charging
the whole of the costs of operating the line to such a small amount of
traffic, the subsidies required by the franchisee to run the service would
be enormous. That would call into question the case for keeping the service
going.
But perhaps the biggest potential hazard from the passenger's point of view
is the threat of fare increases. Superficially, this should not be an issue:
the government has said that, on subsidised services (the large majority),
maximum fare levels will be pegged by the franchising authority when
awarding the franchises, and on the few profit-making services - mainly
InterCity - tough competition from cars, coaches and aircraft should keep
fares down. But again, it is the loss of the so-called network benefits that
poses the greatest threat.
By way of illustration, imagine a return trip from Southend-on-Sea in Essex
to Glasgow. At present, the traveller can go to Southend station and book a
discounted 'saver' return ticket for the complete journey for Pounds 76. But
after privatisation, when the London Tilbury &amp; Southend line and the
London-Glasgow line are operated by different franchisees, the traveller's
cheapest option is likely to be the purchase of two separate tickets: a
discounted return from Southend to London and a discounted return from
London to Glasgow. At today's fare levels, that would cost Pounds 14.80 for
the Southend-London leg and Pounds 69 for the London-Glasgow leg, totalling
Pounds 83.80 - about 10 per cent more than the price of a through ticket.
The government's response to this sort of criticism is that it has
guaranteed the preservation of through ticketing. And so it has: but it has
not guaranteed the preservation of discounted through ticketing, nor has it
guaranteed the validity between franchisees of other discount schemes such
as the senior citizen's railcard. Since 80 per cent of all tickets sold on
BR are discounted in one way or another, the possible consequences for
average fare levels could be far-reaching.
Given the scale of the potential pitfalls, it is tempting to ask why the
government should bother to take on a privatisation as troublesome as that
of British Rail. After all, it can't be for the money: the proceeds will be
next to nothing. And it will do nothing to advance the cause of popular
capitalism, since no shares are being sold.
Then again, consider the alternative: doing nothing. It is highly unlikely
that the government will ever have enough money to provide railway
passengers with the investment levels they would like. And even if it could,
the railway would continue to be run by a management which seems incapable
of delivering a standard of service that the public finds acceptable.
At the end of the day, it all comes down to the government's claim that
every privatisation so far has brought substantial benefits to the consumer.
To an extent, one would have to acknowledge that to be true. But then again,
the privatisation of BR is not like any other. It may yet prove an
uncomfortable ride for the government and passengers alike.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Bank of England Governor: Surprise choice of editor as Bank
deputy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUPERT PENNANT-REA, named the next deputy governor of the Bank of England,
has been described as 'a billiard ball inside a velvet glove,' a phrase
reflecting both his informal friendly manner and his inner reserves of
toughness.
Although the move from editor of The Economist to central banker might seem
an un-expected one, Mr Pennant-Rea has worked at the Bank, from 1973 to
1977, on secondment from the research department of the GMWU municipal
workers' union.
He left the Bank to join Mrs Sarah Hogg, then economics editor of The
Economist, now head of the prime minister's policy unit.
Although he had no background in journalism, Mr Pennant-Rea quickly
displayed an ability to write lucid, stylish articles at great speed with no
revisions or second thoughts - and the ability to go home promptly, his work
done, avoiding the profession's vice of procrastination.
He became the magazine's economics editor on Mrs Hogg's departure in 1981,
and became editor in 1986, after Mr Andrew Knight, now chairman of News
International. There were several other candidates for the job, including Mr
Simon Jenkins, later editor of the Times and a journalist with a
considerably wider public reputation. But there was little doubt among the
magazine's staff that Mr Pennant-Rea would get the job.
His period as editor has seen a sharp increase in the magazine's
circulation, which now stands at more than 500,000, four fifths of it
outside the UK. It has also seen a fierce editorial commitment to policies
of monetary stringency for the UK and to sterling's parity inside the ERM -
an approach that will have endeared Mr Pennant-Rea to Mr Eddie George, the
new governor.
When sterling was forced to leave the ERM in September last year, The
Economist's first reaction was to call for an immediate move to full
monetary union. By coincidence, he spent much of the past week negotiating
with lawyers a lengthy apology to - among others - the Bank of England over
the magazine's allegations that the Bank had obstructed or impeded
investigation of the Blue Arrow affair. The apology took up a full page of
yesterday's issue. He was not approached about the Bank job until yesterday
morning, after the article appeared.
Mr Pennant-Rea grew up in what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and went to
Trinity College, Dublin and Manchester University - a background that has
occasionally set him at odds with the conventional assumptions of the
establishment. He is young by the standards of the deputy-governorship -
today is his 45th birthday.
One journalist who knows him and the Bank well said yesterday: 'I'd describe
him as highly motivated, and an exceedingly imaginative choice for the job.
He'll bring vision and vigour to the musty corridors, and he won't be afraid
to upset people. He'll undoubtedly have his sights on the governorship
itself.'
Whatever his future role, his place in history is secure. He is almost
certainly the only deputy governor of the Bank of England to write a
thriller. Gold Foil, published in 1978, contains a few mildly erotic love
scenes. The book reflects Mr Pennant-Rea's character in a rather different
way, however - it is the result of disciplined months of getting up early to
write a batch of words every day before breakfast.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Bank of England Governor: Eddie George - resolute achiever
at the top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPABLE, honest, straightforward and very sound. These words appear on the
school report of the 11-year-old Eddie George, at the end of his first year
at secondary school in south London.
Such descriptions of Mr George's character have stayed with him during his
30-year career at the Bank of England, which culminated yesterday in his
appointment to take over at the end of June as the Bank's next governor.
Mr Don Gilbert, an old school friend, said yesterday: 'I am delighted by the
news. But to be truthful I was amazed to see how he got on so quickly. He
never struck me as a high flyer.'
Largely because of his qualities of determination and reliability, Mr George
has been on an upward path at Threadneedle Street almost from the day he
arrived. His ruggedness of character has enabled him to overcome the
occasional high-profile setback, such as the controversy over bank
supervision arising from the BCCI affair, and Black Wednesday last
September, when Britain was forced out of the European exchange rate
mechanism.
While he is largely known in the financial community as a 'central bankers'
banker' - hard on inflation, somewhat introverted and more than a little
dour - Mr George has a lighter side to his character. He is known as a
highly entertaining after-dinner speaker in small, intimate gatherings.
Sir Geoffrey Littler, a former Treasury official who knew Mr George well
during the 1980s, said: 'In private, he can be an absolute delight. He likes
a drink, knows how to relax and he's got wit, understanding and depth of
character.'
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union, who is a member of the Bank's court, or board of
directors, said: 'Eddie would never make TV personality of the year. But he
has a quiet sense of humour and he's interested in people.'
Like Mr John Major, the man who chose him for the new job at the pinnacle of
the British establishment, the 54-year-old Mr George grew up in
unfashionable south-west London suburbia. His childhood home was in
Carshalton, Surrey, near the Beddington sewage works. His father was a
postman.
The young Eddie attended Hackbridge primary school, gaining a scholarship to
the more upmarket Dulwich College, a public school in south London. His fees
were paid by Surrey County Council.
At Dulwich he was noticed more for his qualities of resolution than for any
feeling that he was destined for great things. Mr Terry Walsh, who taught
him, remembers him as 'an extremely nifty rugby scrum half. Whatever he did,
he was an achiever. He just got on with things.'
During his national service in the army he learned Russian, in which he is
still fluent, then studied economics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge,
collecting his BA in 1962.
He went straight to the Bank, starting in the economics department. He
gained international experience during a three-year stint at the Bank for
International Settlements in Basle in the late 1960s, and became assistant
director in change of markets in 1980. He was appointed deputy governor
nearly three years ago.
Among Bank insiders, Mr George has a reputation for toughness. One former
official said: 'He's very good at handling financial markets. That means he
has to be a bit devious. But I have never known him to tell an outright lie
or to mislead. He doesn't mind people disagreeing with him, unless it turns
out they cannot substantiate their views.'
Another former official says: 'Eddie likes to dominate things. He is a very
forceful character. If he thinks he's right and you think differently,
you're in for a hard time.'
Mr Major, who worked closely with Mr George during his spell as chancellor
before becoming prime minister, admires the new governor's grasp of the mood
of financial markets and of the complexities of City regulation.
His appointment confirmed that the prime minister did not blame the Bank's
technicians for failing to anticipate the tide of speculation which forced
sterling's withdrawal from the ERM.
Senior Whitehall officials say that Mr George was among those who advocated
an earlier rise in interest rates to defend the pound. But in any event Mr
Major's judgment was that it would have been impossible to save the pound.
Their personal relationship has been helped by the new governor's relaxed
and down-to-earth style. One Downing Street insider said last night that Mr
George's combination of an astute mind and lack of pretension had made him a
'natural choice' for the prime minister.
Mr George, however, will be disappointed by Mr Major's refusal to
contemplate granting the Bank independence. The new governor believes that
it would be possible to combine Bank control of monetary policy with a new
statutory framework to make it accountable to parliament.
For his part Mr George has been impressed by Mr Major's careful and detailed
approach to policy-making. After dealing with him at the Treasury he told
friends that Mr Major was the 'clearest-thinking politician I have ever
met'.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Transport officials defend BR sell-off plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'A BUREAUCRATIC night-mare' is how Mr Brian Wilson, a Labour transport
spokesman, described the bill for the privatisation of British Rail,
published yesterday.
Department of Transport officials rejected the accusation, pointing out that
the bill's 158 pages left it looking relatively flimsy next to the 419-page
tome that paved the way for the privatisation of the water industry in 1989.
Even so, there is little doubting the complexity of the government's
proposals.
The chosen method of privatisation introduces three new quangos - Railtrack,
which will own the tracks; a Rail Regulator to act as a watchdog; and a
Franchise Director to franchise out the passenger services - and provides
for a network of relationships between these and the private-sector train
operators entering the rail market.
As envisaged in the white paper published last July, the effect of the
railways bill will be to split British Rail into two.
Railtrack will own the tracks, and the other part will run the trains. The
freight operations will be sold and the passenger services will be
franchised.
In addition, the railway tracks will in principle be open to any
private-sector operators wanting to run new freight or passenger train
services in competition with existing ones. However, the government has
shown signs of retreating from this commitment in the face of hostility from
would-be franchisees.
Some idea of the government's motivation for privatising the railways can be
gleaned from the preamble to the bill. It says subsidies will go on being
paid to support lossmaking train services even after privatisation, so there
will be no significant cuts in public spending in the short term.
But it goes on to say: 'It is, however, anticipated that private-sector
operation should, over time, allow railway services to be provided at lower
cost to the Exchequer than would otherwise be the case'. The implication is
that the private sector will be rather more efficient at operating trains
than British Rail.
The preamble also reveals that the rail regulator's office will employ up to
100 staff and cost up to Pounds 5m a year to run, while the franchising
director's office will employ up to 175 staff and cost up to Pounds 10m a
year to run.
The bill itself provides for the setting-up of the rail regulator, the
franchising director and the rail users' consultative committees - the new
rail passengers' watchdogs - before going into the detail of how rail
operators will be regulated. Companies wanting to run a train, station or
maintenance depot will have to apply for a licence, it says, and anyone
wanting to object to the application will have the right to do so.
There are also tough rules to make sure that would-be train operators get
access to all the tracks, stations and depots they need to operate a
service.
Every agreement between train operators and facility owners will have to be
notified to the regulator for approval, together with any subsequent
changes.
The regulator will be able to force companies to open their facilities to
other train operators if they do not do so willingly.
Much of the rest of the bill is concerned with the technicalities of
translating the ideas contained in last year's white paper into law, but
some new information emerges. For example:
One clause provides for franchisees to take control of the tracks in the
franchise area as well as the trains if the franchising authority thinks it
appropriate.
The rail regulator and the franchising director will have the power to fine
operators who breach the conditions of their licences or of their
franchises.
All UK public-sector bodies - including British Rail, London Underground or
local authorities - will be excluded from becoming franchisees, but there is
no mention in the bill of public-sector bodies from other countries.
Consumer protection will be given added force by extending the Fair Trading
Act to the railways.
In times of national emergency the secretary of state will be able to
re-assume control of the railways, directing the use of railway facilities
as he or she wishes.
The bill is expected to get its second reading early next month and to win
Royal assent in October.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Marshall 'might quit' if curbed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SIR Colin Marshall, chief executive of British Airways and heir-apparent as
chairman, is likely to resign from the company if he is not allowed to hold
both posts, institutional British Airways shareholders have been told.
In recent private conversations with non-executive directors, including Sir
Michael Angus, big shareholders have emphasised their long-standing unease
about boards which allow a single individual to hold both posts, contrary to
recommendations of the Cadbury report.
Shareholders have said that in light of the Virgin Airlines 'dirty tricks'
affair, that unease has increased.
'We talked to Michael Angus and he told us Colin Marshall wouldn't hang
around if he couldn't be chairman as well,' one shareholder said.
Shareholders said that because they had been impressed with Sir Colin's
management of British Airways, they were unwilling to press for action which
would result in his resignation.
'They have appointed a managing director and that is supposed to reassure us
that the proper checks and balances are in place,' one institutional
investor noted.
Meanwhile, some shareholders said they are still not satisfied that British
Airways had dealt with the matter fully. 'I feel they haven't tried too hard
to get to the bottom of this,' said one investor. He noted that BA's
solicitors had conducted a previous investigation into dirty tricks
allegations a year ago and found nothing.
'What was the quantity of wrongdoing, what was the number of people
involved? Was it just in the UK or was it Japan and the US as well?', a
shareholder said.
Shareholders said their concern was that if BA failed to react forcefully
and publicly, it could be vulnerable to adverse commercial circumstances.
'If any of the competitive US airlines start saying we have anti-competitive
practices, it could be trouble,' said one shareholder.
However, institutions said they had no desire to see any resignations among
the members of the board. Moreover, confidence has been bolstered by
personal assurances from Sir Michael Angus that steps were being taken to
tighten management.

FT  23 JAN 93 / US flying public unperturbed

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF MR Richard Branson and his Virgin Atlantic airline have won a moral
battle against British Airways' 'dirty tricks' campaign, the US flying
public and media have taken little notice, Laurie Morse in New York writes.
While the story is a drama of corporate sabotage and discovery, the US
popular press has barely noticed the tiff.
US business newspapers reported Virgin's January 11 court victory straight,
with no moralising, and barely noted BA's second apology this week.
Travel agents in New York said there was no sign of mass defections from BA
in an exhibition of moral outrage.
'My clients all know it (the airline industry) is cut-throat,' said one
Manhattan travel broker. 'This doesn't surprise any of them.'
Not only is it not a surprise, other travel agents added, the court battle
is largely irrelevant to travellers, who care more about price and service
than moral rectitude when choosing an airline.

BRITISH AIRWAYS has decided to 'foreshorten by a few days' certain of its
advertising campaigns in the UK, Gary Mead writes. Fifty poster sites in
central London - priced on the open market in the region of Pounds 50,000
and booked for BA - have become available for two weeks and Virgin's
advertising agency - Woollams Moira Gaskin O'Malley - has snapped them up
for about Pounds 5,000. In place of BA's 'The world's favourite airline'
poster there are two Virgin posters, one of which is pictured above.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Anglo-Irish talks resume next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DATE of the next Anglo-Irish conference meeting has been fixed for early
next month, following 'informal talks' in Dublin yesterday between Sir
Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring,
Ireland's new foreign minister.
Yesterday's meeting was the first between the two governments since
November, when it was agreed to suspend further efforts to renew the
political talks process in Northern Ireland until after the general
elections in the Republic.
Mr Spring and Sir Patrick said their first meeting had been 'very worthwhile
and satisfactory' and that they had covered all the main areas necessary 'to
get the talks process working well and to bring it to a successful
conclusion'. It is expected that at least two Anglo-Irish conference
meetings will be necessary to prepare the way for a renewed series of talks
involving the Northern Ireland political parties.
The previous 'three-strand' talks ended inconclusively last year, with the
two Unionist parties accusing Dublin of having been too inflexible over the
Republic's territorial claim to the province.
Sir Patrick said yesterday: 'Informal consultations should be the first
stage and then we'll see where that takes us.'

FT  23 JAN 93 / Sunday shopping curbs supported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE ON the govern-ment to speed up reform of Sunday trading laws in
England and Wales intensified yesterday as MPs voted decisively to allow a
private member's bill seeking tight restrictions on Sunday opening to
progress to line-by-line committee stage scrutiny.
Mr Ray Powell's Shops (Amendment) Bill - backed by the Keep Sunday Special
campaign - received its second Commons reading by a majority of 173 (214
votes to 41).
Supporters of the proposals later called on the government to accept their
offer to consider constructive amendments to the bill in order to get a law
on to the statute book by this summer. But Mr Peter Lloyd, Home Office
minister, told MPs the changes deemed necessary by the government were 'more
than can be managed' in a private member's bill committee.
He said he would be 'disappointed' if the government's Sunday trading bill,
offering MPs a choice between options ranging from full-scale deregulation
to a tightening of existing laws, was not ready in the next few weeks. But
he admitted he held out little hope of bringing such a bill before the House
until autumn.
Mr Michael Schluter, director of the Keep Sunday Special campaign, said the
campaign would continue to co-operate with those drafting the government's
bill but reserved the right to ask its supporters to oppose the measure if
it did not include 'proper employee protection'.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Lautro reports low standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUARTER of the companies inspected by Lautro, the life insurance
industry's watchdog, in the year to June 1992 did not have procedures
adequate to ensure that suitable advice was provided to clients.
Mr Kit Jebens, Lautro's chief executive, said: 'I don't think standards are
where we want to get to.' He added that the shortcomings of companies had
often come from lack of understanding rather than deliberate neglect, but
added that after five years of the self-regulatory regime '25 per cent is
too high a failure rate'.
The annual report of Lautro's monitoring committee also shows that
complaints increased by 17 per cent from the previous 12 months, from 4,069
to 4,763. The number of 'significant' complaints passed to Lautro members
for action increased from 1,332 to 1,999, the report shows.
Lautro's findings are the result of its programme of 136 periodic inspection
visits to members during the 12 months covered by the report. Most of the
companies inspected were life insurance companies because the regulator's
main concern at present is with sales forces.
The total number of sales representatives registered by Lautro to give
investment advice has declined in the past year from nearly 200,000 to about
170,000.
Mr Jebens said the figures pointed to a considerable improvement in
standards in the industry, and added: 'While it is impossible to guarantee
that no salesperson or member will ever put a foot wrong again, we can say
with some confidence that the probability is greatly reduced.'

FT  23 JAN 93 / Audit regulation has 'improved standards'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 90 per cent of auditors think the quality of their work has
improved following the introduction of the new audit regulation regime, a
survey showed yesterday. And more than a third say they have noticed
considerable improvement.
Many accountants have had to make changes to their methods, systems, quality
controls, staff training and administration in the past year, according to
176 practitioners questioned by Audit Briefing, a monthly newsletter
published by Tolley.
Audit regulation was introduced by the 1989 Companies Act and became active
in October 1991, with the launch of inspections by self-regulatory
monitoring bodies.
The survey showed that substantial changes had been made in preparation for
the regime, although only 11 per cent of those questioned had been visited
by regulators.
A third believed more audit work was now required for particular types of
client, especially small and family businesses and other regulated clients.
More than 90 per cent of firms had experienced a rise in chargeable hours
required to audit an average client, and a corresponding increase in costs.
In view of the competitive market for audit services, more than half the
firms absorbed at least part of the costs. Nearly 90 per cent felt the work
required to comply with audit regulation was to some degree superfluous. But
three quarters of those visited by the regulators felt their recommendations
were reasonable, two thirds that they were of considerable use, and 16 per
cent believed they were very useful.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Lloyd's chief promises sharp cost-cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF LONDON is poised to launch a radical assault on its cost base, Mr
Peter Middleton, chief executive, told a meeting of Names yesterday.
Mr Middleton said neither he nor Mr David Rowland, the chairman of Lloyd's,
would be prepared to continue in their jobs if the cuts were not implemented
by agencies and brokers.
He told a meeting organised by the Society of Names, which acts as a
pressure group for lossmaking Names: 'The market must accept them or it will
continue to slide. I don't want to be connected with an enterprise that
doesn't want to be the best.'
Mr Middleton intends to produce a detailed business plan by the second half
of April.
He said: 'The changes are going to be very painful, but they are very
necessary. Unless we implement them, we will have no basis on which to
attract capital.'
Failure to implement the changes would condemn Lloyd's to 'mediocrity and
growing irrelevance in the world of insurance. It is that serious.'
Potentially far-reaching changes to the Lloyd's agency system - which
connects the market's individual traders or Names with their underwriting
syndicates - are under consideration as part of the business plan.
In particular Mr Middleton will look carefully at the future of members'
agencies, which deal directly with the affairs of Names.
He said: 'I think it would be better to centralise everything other than
investment advice and recruitment of Names.'
He was bitterly critical of the way the market processes claims. 'A
flow-chart of the claims payments system resembled a combination of the New
York subway, the London Underground and the Paris Metro, with a map of the
European railway network superimposed.'
Lloyd's had managed to 'make a very simple system terribly complicated', he
said.
The market needed to revamp the way it collected and analysed data, added Mr
Middleton. He said: 'Some of the ways information is collected are 10 times
more costly than need be.'
Mr Middleton has already announced a cut in the budget of the corporation,
which administers the market, from Pounds 145m to Pounds 117.9m. Mr
Middleton intends to tell corporation staff how the cuts will be implemented
by the end of February.
Lloyd's has welcomed a US court judgment in a multi-million dollar dispute
involving pollution at a site operated by Shell Oil at the Rocky Mountain
Arsenal in Denver, Colorado.
The California Court of Appeal ruled that liability for pollution at the
site is excluded from the company's insurance policies, where Shell
manufactured chemicals from 1952. Underwriters at Lloyd's were among a
number of insurers which provided liability coverage to Shell.
Shell was obliged to clean up the site with the cost estimated at more than
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m). The London market's potential exposure is
estimated at several hundred million dollars.
The case is one of dozens involving insurers, including Lloyd's and
companies in the London market, and US policyholders.
Shell originally filed suit against its insurers in 1983, seeking to show
that its insurance policies made insurers liable. In 1988 insurers won
initial judgment in the San Francisco court.
Lloyd's said: 'This is a very welcome decision in important and extremely
complex litigation.'

FT  23 JAN 93 / Union deal saves Hoover plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOOVER'S production plant in Glasgow has been saved from closure as a result
of a far-reaching deal reached yesterday between the US consumer group and
the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union.
The 1,000-strong workforce at Cambuslang approved the agreement yesterday at
a lunchtime meeting. An estimated 700 jobs will be created under the deal -
400 at Cambuslang and the rest at Hoover's factory at Merthyr Tydfil, South
Wales.
The agreement - reached after weeks of secret negotiations between the
company and the union - involves a 12-month pay freeze and radical changes
in working practices, including the introduction of flexible and
interchangeable skill working.
Hoover is expected to announce the closure of its French production plant at
Dijon next week. The AEEU was told by the company that it would have to
agree to the changes proposed or the Cambuslang plant and not the Dijon
operation would have had to be closed.
Mr Jimmy Airlie, AEEU national official for Scotland, said yesterday: 'We
have saved the future of the plant. It is a tough deal, but we had no
alternative but to accept it. It is a good day for Cambuslang.'
The union has had to accept a curb on its power. All shop stewards will have
to work normally at their former jobs and not remain full-time working on
trade union business.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Transport officials defend BR privatisation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Transport yesterday rejected accusations that the bill
paving the way for the privatisation of British Rail, published yesterday,
was a 'bureaucratic nightmare', pointing out that the document's 158 pages
left it looking relatively flimsy next to the 419-page tome on selling the
water industry which appeared in 1989.
Even so, there is little doubting the complexity of the government's
proposals.
The chosen method of privatisation introduces three new quangos - a
track-owning authority; a rail regulator to act as a watchdog; and a
franchise director to franchise out the passenger services - and provides
for a network of relationships between these and the private-sector train
operators entering the rail market.
As envisaged in the white paper published last July, the effect of the
Railways Bill will be to split British Rail into two. Railtrack will own the
tracks, and the other part will run the trains. The freight operations will
be sold and the passenger services will be franchised.
In addition, tracks will in principle be open to any private-sector
operators wanting to run new freight or passenger train services in
competition with existing ones. However, the government has shown signs of
retreating from this in the face of hostility from would-be franchisees.
The bill says subsidies will go on being paid to support lossmaking train
services even after privatisation, so there will be no significant cuts in
public spending in the short term.
But it goes on to say: 'It is, however, anticipated that private-sector
operation should, over time, allow railway services to be provided at lower
cost to the Exchequer than would otherwise be the case'. The implication is
that the private sector will be rather more efficient at operating trains
than British Rail.
The bill itself provides for the setting up of the regulator, the
franchising director and the rail users' consultative committees - the new
rail passengers' watchdogs - before going into the detail of how rail
operators will be regulated. Companies wanting to run a train, station or
maintenance depot will have to apply for a licence it says, and anyone
wanting to object to the application will be able to do so.
Every agreement between train operators and facility owners will have to be
notified to the regulator for approval, with any subsequent changes.
The regulator will be able to force companies to open their facilities to
other train operators if they do not do so willingly.
Some new information also emerges. For example:
One clause provides for franchisees to take control of the tracks in the
franchise area as well as the trains if the franchising authority thinks it
appropriate.
The rail regulator and the franchising director will have the power to fine
operators who breach the conditions of their licences or of their
franchises.
All UK public-sector bodies - including British Rail, London Underground or
local authorities - will be excluded from becoming franchisees, but there is
no mention in the bill of public-sector bodies from other countries.
The bill is expected to get its second reading early next month and to win
Royal assent in October.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Editors to widen complaints body
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWSPAPER editors yesterday signalled they were prepared to respond to
criticism of the Press Complaints Commission by changing its composition to
guarantee a majority of members from outside the industry.
A statement by the Newspaper Publishers Association said a meeting of 21
editors unanimously rejected the proposal in the Calcutt report on press
freedom for statutory regulation. But they agreed that wider membership of
the commission should be accompanied by changes to its code of practice to
safeguard against eavesdropping and bugging.
The editors agreed also to consider a proposal from some newspapers that
appointments to the commission might be made by a body independent of the
industry.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Jaguar to invest Pounds 700m in five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR, the UK luxury carmaker and a subsidiary of Ford of the US, said
yesterday that it plans to invest about Pounds 700m during the next five
years to develop new models and modernise its production plants, Kevin Done
writes.
The plan includes the development of replacement models for Jaguar's
existing XJ6 saloon and XJS coupe and convertible ranges.
Jaguar also aims to produce smaller sporty saloons to compete with models
such as the BMW 5-Series and will develop a range of V8 engines to be built
at the Ford engine plant at Bridgend, south Wales.
The programme to develop a revamped XJ6 saloon has already been approved by
Ford.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Lautro reports low standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUARTER of the companies inspected by Lautro, the life insurance
industry's watchdog, in the year to June 1992 did not have procedures
adequate to ensure that suitable advice was provided to clients.
Mr Kit Jebens, Lautro's chief executive, said: 'I don't think standards are
where we want to get to.'
He added that the shortcomings of companies had often come from lack of
understanding rather than deliberate neglect, but added that after five
years of the self-regulatory regime '25 per cent is too high a failure
rate'.
The annual report of Lautro's monitoring committee also shows that
complaints increased by 17 per cent from the previous 12 months, from 4,069
to 4,763. The number of 'significant' complaints passed to Lautro members
for action increased from 1,332 to 1,999, the report shows.
Lautro's findings are the result of its programme of 136 periodic inspection
visits to members during the 12 months covered by the report. Most of the
companies inspected were life insurance companies because the regulator's
main concern at present is with sales forces.
The total number of sales representatives registered by Lautro to give
investment advice has declined in the past year from nearly 200,000 to about
170,000.
A new series of inspection visits will start next month, and continue for 30
months.
Mr Jebens said the figures pointed to a considerable improvement in
standards in the industry, and added: 'While it is impossible to guarantee
that no salesperson or member will ever put a foot wrong again, we can say
with some confidence that the probability is greatly reduced and that the
quality of advice and client handling has improved very significantly.'
He cited an independent report into one life company's client questionnaires
as evidence. The report said that in mid-1988 75 per cent of these
questionnaires had been inadequate to provide financial advice. By last year
this had fallen to 20 per cent.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Ceasefire survives as US plane attacks Iraq battery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ceasefire ordered by President Saddam Hussein appeared still to be
intact yesterday, despite another clash between US aircraft and Iraqi ground
forces.
The US Defence Department said its aircraft had fired at and missed an Iraqi
SAM-3 missile battery that had switched on its target tracking radar, but
they did not know if the activation of the radar was a deliberate challenge
by Iraq or if an individual anti-aircraft battery had not received the
ceasefire order.
However, Iraq said it had no missiles in the area, and called the US missile
firing a provocation.
Orders issued to US, French and British aircraft patrolling the two air
exclusion zones in northern and southern Iraq have not changed since the new
US administration of President Bill Clinton took office on Wednesday. Pilots
may fire to protect themselves in the event of any hostile or threat ening
action by Iraqi aircraft or ground defences.
Threatening action certainly includes 'lock-on' by fire control radar
attached to anti-air craft missile batteries. Pentagon officials say a pilot
on the receiving end of these high frequency radars generally knows he is
seconds away from being a missile target.
It is less clear whether coalition aircraft are also authorised to fire when
they are 'painted' or 'illuminated' by search radar, which operate at much
lower frequencies.
US aircraft on Thursday attacked a radar which had merely illuminated them,
but immediately before the radar was switched on they had come under
anti-aircraft artillery fire.
A White House spokesman said yesterday that Mr Clinton was 'prepared to hold
firm with Iraq'. 'If the Iraqis take hostile action against the American
pilots, they will respond.'
James Whittington in Baghdad adds: All heads of diplomatic missions in
Baghdad were yesterday summoned to the Iraqi Foreign Office and told Mr
Mohammed Sa'id Kazin al Sahhaf, that Iraq intends to stick to its ceasefire.

FT  23 JAN 93 / US housing starts up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Commerce Department yesterday reported a 5.5 per cent increase in US
housing starts between November and December, a larger increase than
expected and fresh evidence that the recovery is becoming more firmly
established, Michael Prowse writes.
For 1992 as a whole, starts rose 18.5 per cent, the first annual gain since
1986. Starts rose in all parts of the country last month, except the west,
reflecting continuing recession in California.
Building permits, a guide to future construction activity, also rose sharply
last month to their highest level in nearly three years.
The rise in starts follows a mildly encouraging assessment of regional
conditions from the Federal Reserve in its 'Beige Book' but found little
evidence of job creation.

FT  23 JAN 93 / EC eager to resume Gatt talks with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW US administration may be willing to match the momentum in the
European Community aimed at completing the Uruguay Round of talks on world
trade reforms, it emerged yesterday.
Even as Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US trade representative, was being sworn
in, plans were being made for an early resumption of US-EC talks.
Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's trade commissioner, said
yesterday in an interview at the Financial Times that 'momentum had been
jacked up'. It was now at a point where 'if the Clinton administration picks
up the ball and runs with it' an agreement was possible before presidential
power to press a Uruguay Round deal quickly through Congress expires early
in March.
He said he was ready to meet Mr Kantor at a moment's notice. He claimed a
deal had come tantalisingly close in Geneva last week following significant
headway on proposed tariff cuts in sensitive sectors such as textiles and
electronics. They stopped short because of US pressure to rewrite other
parts of the draft Uruguay round agreement. 'I don't believe that
substantial changes are possible without Pandora's box being opened,' Sir
Leon said.
'Everything depends on the attitude of the US administration.'
Sir Leon saw his first priority as being to impress on them 'the urgency and
desirability of reaching an early agreement. There is no single step which
will have a more beneficial effect on the world economy than an agreement.'
He conceded that tangible trade gains would take time to emerge, but an
important boost could come from the 'announcement effect' of a breakthrough.
'If there is some degree of common perception not of the deal, but of the
necessity for a deal and the approach towards a deal, we can give
instructions to negotiators to go back to Geneva and get on with it.'
Deadlines have constantly been broken for completion of the Uruguay round
talks. , which are now in their seventh year.
A breakthrough in November in a year-long US-EC dispute on reform of farm
trade came too late to make a deal possible before US presidential
elections.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Summers has thorny task of revitalising G7
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HE is undoubtedly clever, forceful and articulate, but is he a natural
diplomat? That is the question likely to be asked about Mr Lawrence Summers,
named this week as under-secretary for international affairs at the US
Treasury - the post held in the Bush administration by Mr David Mulford.
At the Treasury, Mr Summers is likely to have prime responsibility in two
crucial areas - economic policy co-ordination between the Group of Seven
leading industrial countries and support for economic reform in the former
Soviet republics.
His new boss, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, has emphasised his
desire to revitalise the G7. The delicate task is likely to fall to Mr
Summers, who will spend a lot of time in coming months jetting between Bonn,
Tokyo and London in search of a common approach to economic problems.
The potential for conflict is considerable. The US badly wants other G7
powers to shore up its still fragile recovery by stimulating their own
economies. Mr Summers is likely to argue that countries like Germany, should
put less stress on fighting inflation and more on promoting growth and jobs.
Mr Summers moves to the Treasury from the World Bank where he was serving as
chief economist, on leave from his economics chair at Harvard University. He
has long coveted a top Washington job, having served as economic adviser in
the abortive 1988 Democratic presidential campaign.
He initially set his sights on the chairmanship of President Bill Clinton's
Council of Economic Advisers traditionally the top job for academic
economists.
That job went however to Ms Laura Tyson, an expert in trade and industrial
policy at the University of California.
But if confirmed by the Senate, Mr Summers may find the Treasury
international post a sweet consolation prize. He will be intimately involved
in day-to-day policymaking; the CEA, by contrast is an advisory body with no
direct line responsibility.
Nobody doubts Mr Summers' intellectual abilities. He received tenure at
Harvard at the age of 28 and became a prolific author of academic papers in
diverse fields, including tax theory (he is a trenchant supporter of
investment tax credits), unemployment and the efficiency of financial
markets.
Some joke that he has economics in his blood: two of his uncles, Paul
Samuelson and Kenneth Arrow, are Nobel laureates in economics. His parents
are both economists.
Mr Summers' stint at the World Bank, however, was not without controversy.
Unusually for an academic, Mr Summers speaks with an assurance bordering on
arrogance; he has an almost Thatcherite lack of self-doubt. Although he
arrived at the bank with little prior experience of the third world, he lost
no time in speaking out on controversial issues.
His worst error at the World Bank was an insensitively written memo that
appeared to advocate the dumping of toxic waste in less developed countries.
According to him the memo was intended to spark internal debate, not a
policy recommendation. It infuriated environmentalists and may have cost him
a cabinet post in the Clinton administration. At the Treasury, similar
mistakes of judgment could have far worse consequences.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Japan's trade surplus surges to Dollars 107.06bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S trade surplus surged 37.6 per cent last year to a record Dollars
107.06bn (Pounds 70.40bn), as demand for imports weakened and the
politically-sensitive surpluses with the US and European Community each rose
by 14 per cent.
The Japanese government is concerned that the record surplus, far exceeding
the previous high of Dollars 82.7bn in 1986, will attract criticism from the
new US Administration, which has indicated that it will take a tougher line
on trade.
Officials at the Ministry of Finance said an emergency economic package
introduced late last year should stimulate demand for imports, but the Bank
of Japan conceded that the surplus is unlikely to decline in the near
future.
Customs-cleared exports rose over the year by 8 per cent to Dollars
339.76bn, while imports were 1.7 per cent lower at Dollars 232.70bn, the
first decline since 1986 and a result of falling capital investment and a
slowing of demand for imported luxury goods, particularly those from Europe.
During December, the surplus rose 12 per cent from the same month last year
to Dollars 11.23bn, following a 4.3 per cent increase in exports and a slim
0.3 per cent gain in imports.
General machinery exports expanded by 11.9 per cent and those of chemical
products were 11.4 per cent higher.
Japanese officials said the expansion of the surplus reflected fluctuations
in exchange rates and commodity prices, but the export increase came partly
from the attempts of Japanese industry to utilise excess capacity created
during the late 1980s, when investment in new plant rose sharply.
Over the year, exports of cars and other transport machinery rose by 11.9
per cent and semiconductor equipment by 19.7 per cent, two of the most
sensitive areas of trade with the US and Europe.
Imports of EC cars fell 6.7 per cent and of art works by 64.1 per cent, a
by-product of the collapsing 'financial bubble'.
The 1992 trade statistics reflected Japan's increasing reliance on Asian
markets, and the gathering momentum of the Chinese economy.
Japan's exports to China jumped 39.2 per cent and imports from China were 19
per cent higher, while Japan's surplus with the newly-industrialised
economies of Asia rose 17.6 per cent.
However, Japan's trade with Russia fell sharply, with exports down 49 per
cent and imports 27.7 per cent lower. Exports to the UK rose 11.3 per cent
to Dollars 12.3bn, while imports from the UK were down 2.4 per cent to
Dollars 4.9bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TUG boats and fire-fighting vessels were last night battling to prevent an
environmental disaster and control a fire on board the Maersk Navigator, a
fully-laden supertanker drifting 100 miles off the northern tip of the
Indonesian island of Sumatra.
The supertanker, carrying nearly 2m barrels of crude oil, collided with a
smaller unladen tanker at the northern entrance to the Malacca Strait early
on Thursday. The 24-man crew, including the British captain, abandoned ship
and were rescued by a passing vessel.
The Maersk Navigator's Danish owners say the supertanker is leaking oil and
a slick two miles long and 200 yards wide was reported yesterday. The owners
say the oil is seeping from one of 12 cargo holds.
The ship is reported to be drifting slowly away from land and the owners say
it is likely that any oil spilled so far will evaporate. A salvage crew has
managed to board the vessel and tug boats have attached lines. But there is
still no independent assessment of the scale of the problem.
The coastal authorities in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have been put
on alert to tackle an oil spillage.
A Singapore salvage expert said the salvage teams will try to contain the
fire on board the Maersk Navigator and assess how serious is the leak from
its cargo tanks. 'It could take several days to cool the vessel down and
transfer such a large amount of oil onto another supertanker,' he said.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Clinton lifts restrictions on abortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday lifted a series of restrictions on abortion
imposed during the Reagan and Bush presidencies.
Mr Clinton, in one of the first acts of his presidency, signed executive
orders ending restrictions on:
Abortion counselling at clinics which receive federal funding;
Research using tissue from aborted foetuses;
Abortions performed at military hospitals;
Funding for United Nations population programmes.
The newly installed president also ordered a review of the ban on RU-486,
the abortion pill produced by France's Roussel Uclaf.
The end of the ban on counselling at federally funded clinics by anyone
other than doc tors, known by its critics as the 'gag rule', was viewed as
the greatest symbolic victory for supporters of the right to choose an
abortion, but may have less practical significance, since the ban's
implementation was already suspended by court order.
Overturning the Bush administration's prohibition of federal funding for
foetal tissue research, though still controversial, was supported by some
prominent anti-abortion Republicans.
The moves came on the 20th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling in Roe vs
Wade that the right to privacy, which is grounded in the 14th amendment to
the US constitution, protects a woman's decision whether or not to bear a
child.
Congressional leaders, who are worried that today's more conservative
Supreme Court might overturn the decision, plan legislation embodying Roe vs
Wade's principles. These principles give entire freedom to a woman and her
physician in the first trimester of a pregnancy, allow some state regulation
in the second trimester and permit states to ban all abortions in the third
trimester, except where the mother's life is in danger.
Although opinion on the issue of abortion does not split entirely along
party lines, Democrats have in general supported the right to choose an
abortion, while Republicans have taken an anti-abortion position.
Some abortion rights campaigners hope that the arrival of a Democratic
president who supports their views will allow them to move off the defensive
and place more emphasis on education and contraception, to help reduce the
number of abortions take place.
The Center for Disease Control has estimated that around 1.4m abortions were
carried out in the US in 1990.

MR JOHN MAJOR, the British prime minister, leaves for India today planning
to stress the importance of further economic reform there if British
investment is to expand.
Whitehall officials were playing down the likelihood of deals being
announced during the prime minister's trip. But he will be accompanied by 17
businessmen from some of Britain's largest companies, including British
Aerospace which is hoping for progress on a contract to sell Hawk trainer
jets to the Indian air force. Britain is the largest foreign investor in
India.
Mr Major will be guest of honour at India's republic day celebrations on
Tuesday.

JAPAN'S economy will not start to recover until the second half of this
year, the Bank of Japan warned yesterday in its quarterly economic outlook.
But the economy will avoid a severe credit crunch threatened by a financial
system weakened by bad debts.
The bank said private-sector demand would not recover in the first six
months, with personal consumption stagnant and corporate investment
depressed. 'It may be some time before business sentiment exhibits any firm
recovery,' it warned.
The report said the economy would gradually recover as last year's cuts in
interest rates and the recently approved supplementary budget of public
works filtered through into the economy.
Economists believe the bank will soon come under new pressure to cut
interest rates further, as inflation abates and consumer confidence wanes.
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is preparing a spring economic package
to boost the economy. But the Tokyo stock market could fall again if
companies start to sell some of their holdings of securities to boost
profits towards the end of the financial year in March.
The bank insisted there would be no credit crunch, because the hard-pressed
Japanese banks are ready to expand lending as the economy recovers. Low bank
lending has been one of the main reasons why the money supply fell 0.5 per
cent in the last three months of the year.
Big companies have had no problems funding borrowing needs by issuing bonds
and commercial paper. However, smaller companies, which are exhausting their
capacity to fund investment through selling liquid assets are starting to
increase their loan demand.
Commercial banks are relaxing lending policies for their branches partly
because they are alarmed at the decline in the volume of business.
The report also predicts that the money supply will soon begin to recover as
spending on public works increases.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said at the opening of the Japanese
parliament the economy was in a grim state and Japan was in the midst of
political and social upheaval.
He called for the country to increase its international contributions, for
social reforms to create a better quality of life for consumers, and for
political reforms to eliminate corruption from the political system.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Salutory lesson in Washington ways: Baird's withdrawal for a
yuppie offence gets the new era off to a bad start
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has now joined the sort of club of which he would
rather not be a member. Like five of his six predecessors, he has seen a
nominee go down in flames and his own administration get off to the sort of
start it would have preferred to avoid.
In accepting Ms Zoe Baird's withdrawal as prospective attorney-general, Mr
Clinton essentially decided to cut his losses and save his credits for a
battle more central to his presidency, like health care and jobs creation.
But sacrificing a nominee in the first two days of office does not quite
convey the sense of strength and purpose that he hoped he would bring to the
office.
Weighing on Mr Clinton's mind must have been the precedents which provide
conflicting advice. President George Bush stuck with the nomination of Mr
John Tower to be defence secretary, lost it, and never really regained the
upper hand with Congress.
President Jimmy Carter faced two such battles. He stuck with Mr Bert Lance,
his budget director, and won confirmation, only to have Mr Lance resign
under a cloud of scandal six months later. He let Mr Theodore Sorensen, his
CIA nominee, withdraw. The combination of both affairs may have marked the
beginning of the slow unravelling of confidence in his presidency.
President Ronald Reagan saw a lesser state department nominee, Mr Ernest
Lefever, a particularly controversial right winger, denied office, but that
proved to be a mere blip on his first term. In 1987 he could not get Senate
approval of Mr Robert Bork for the Supreme Court, a fate that also befell
the Court nominees of Presidents Johnson and Nixon later in their terms.
Ms Baird was undone, politically, by a curious combination of circumstances.
Mr Clinton himself seems to have chosen Mrs Baird at the very last minute -
she was previously in line to be White House legal counsel.
In the crunch, he never stood four square behind her, which exposed the
weakness of her own political constituency. As a corporate lawyer, she
seemed to appeal more to Republicans in the Senate than to Democrats.
This week she picked up two powerful opponents, both Democrats, in the
persons of two principled (and black) law professors - Ms Barbara Jordan of
Texas University and Ms Patricia King of Georgetown. Both said
unequivocally, that someone who has admitted breaking the law, as Ms Baird
had, was automatically disqualified from being the nation's chief law
enforcement officer.
Her crime was quickly deemed a 'yuppie' offence, and much was made of the
fact that someone who was earning Dollars 500,000 a year did not have to
stoop to employing illegal immigrants. That the offence is rampant in
Washington and the nation's more affluent suburbs mattered less than the
floods of hostile mail received by the Senators from their less affluent
constituents and by the opposition reflected in instant polls and talk show
conversations, many of which recalled Mr Clinton's campaign promise to
respect those who 'paid their taxes . . . and played by the rules.'
Even if Mr Clinton can limit the damage, he is still left with a tricky
problem of finding another attorney general. The women's lobby, which had
begun to distance itself from Ms Baird in the last 48 hours, still expects a
woman to run the justice department, which was the President's proud
proclamation just last month.
At the very least President Bill Clinton has received an early and salutary
education in the ways of Washington.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Ceasefire 'survives' as US aircraft fire missiles in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US aircraft again fired missiles yesterday at an Iraqi air defence battery
that had turned on its radar, but neither side seemed anxious to declare
that the ceasefire ordered by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had broken
down.
Iraq said it had no missile batteries in the area.
US officials said the activation of the radar could be a deliberate
provocation by Iraq, but added that it was also possible that an individual
anti-aircraft battery had not received or had disobeyed the ceasefire order.
Orders issued to US, French and British aircraft patrolling the two air
exclusion zones in northern and southern Iraq have not changed since the new
US administration of President Bill Clinton took office on Wednesday. Pilots
may fire to protect themselves in the event of any hostile or threatening
action by Iraqi aircraft or ground defences.
Threatening action certainly includes 'lock-on' by fire control radar
attached to anti-aircraft missile batteries. Pentagon officials say a pilot
on the receiving end of these high frequency radars generally knows he is
seconds away from being a missile target.
It is less clear whether coalition aircraft are also authorised to fire when
they are 'painted' or 'illuminated' by search radar, which operate at much
lower frequencies.
US aircraft on Thursday attacked a radar which had merely illuminated them,
but immediately before the radar was switched on they had come under
anti-aircraft artillery fire.
President Clinton and his advisers have made clear that they are sticking to
the policy of insisting that Iraq comply fully with United Nations
resolutions, and of responding to any threat against allied aircraft in the
no-fly zones.
James Whittington in Baghdad adds: Diplomats in Iraq said yesterday the
regime seemed to have reversed its former aggressive tone towards settling
the crisis, but questioned whether it would last.
All heads of the remaining diplomatic missions in Baghdad were yesterday
summoned to the Iraqi foreign office to be told by the foreign minister, Mr
Mohammed Sa'id Kazin al Sahhaf, that Iraq intends to stick to its ceasefire.
The minister denied that its army had triggered Thursday's attack in the
north by switching its radar on.
The regime has published an opinion poll showing that 82 per cent of Iraqis
said they supported Mr Saddam Hussein's peace initiative while 18 per cent
said they wanted further military confrontation.

<TEXT>
THE Nato alliance's chief mission, the defence of western Europe, risks
being undermined by sharp cuts in defence spending by its members, Mr
Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, said yesterday.
Mr Worner warned that some - perhaps all - alliance members could be tempted
to ignore the main defence force by focusing on innovations such as
peace-keeping and the creation of a mobile rapid reaction force.
Belgium has announced plans to cut its armed forces by nearly 50 per cent to
45,000 by 1995; the Netherlands aims to cuts the size of its army by more
than half to 37,000 by the end of the century. These figures are inflated by
the decision to end conscription by 1995 and 1998 respectively.
Other Nato allies, hit by recession, are considering deep defence cuts.
Germany faces a huge budget deficit because of the costs of unification.
At a news conference in Brussels, Mr Worner reaffirmed that Nato remained
the principal forum on European security questions. The Western European
Union - the nascent defence arm of the European Community - was still
complementary but subordinate to Nato, he said.
Nato officials are worried that defence cuts in Europe will provoke
retaliation in Washington. Already, the US Congress has passed a bill which
reduces US spending on Nato infrastructure this year to Dollars 60m (Pounds
39.4m), down from a planned Dollars 240m.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Croatian attack on Serbs shatters ceasefire: Krajina
offensive threatens to put skids under United Nations peace arrangements

CROATIAN troops yesterday launched an offensive into Serb-held Krajina,
crossing the UN ceasefire line and threatening to wreck UN peace
arrangements in Croatia and undermine the Bosnian peace talks, which resume
in Geneva today.
A Croatian advance provoked an immediate warning from the leaders of the
rump Yugoslav federation and the Bosnian Serbs that their forces would go to
the help of Serbs in Krajina if the Croat attacks were not stopped.
The UN Security Council deplored the Croatian offensive and urged the
Croatian authorities to withdraw their forces to their previous positions.
It called upon all the parties not to take any action that would jeopardise
the peace process.
In a letter to the Security Council yesterday, Mr Dobrica Cosic, the
Yugoslav president, said that if the UN did not stop Croat encroachments,
Belgrade would do so. 'We are now at a turning point - either towards peace
or toward total war,' he warned.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, who promised similar action,
said he believed Croatia was aiming to wreck efforts to bring peace to
Bosnia.
However, Mr Fred Eckhard, the spokesman for international mediators Mr Cyrus
Vance and Lord Owen, said last night there was no indication that the Geneva
talks, due to be resumed today, would be postponed as a result of the
fighting in Krajina. 'If anything, it will provide a venue for the
principals to talk it over,' he said.
UN officials in Zagreb said Croatian troops crossed the year-old ceasefire
line around the Maslenica bridge, the main overland route linking central
Croatia with its southern Adriatic coast and around the Zemunik airport,
near the port of Zadar.
The offensive comes amid mounting frustration among Croat leaders over their
lack of control over about one-third of Croatia, which is held by Serb
militias and under nominal UN authority.
'They have told us they want to secure the Maslenica bridge area and the
area around it because they are exasperated with Serb delays with regard to
reconstruction of the vital bridge,' Mr Cedric Thornberry, the UN chief of
civilian affairs, said in Zagreb.
Yesterday's offensive shattered a relatively stable ceasefire in Croatia and
raised fears of a renewal of the Serbo-Croat war. At least 10,000 people
were killed in the seven-month conflict in Croatia which erupted in June
1991 when the western republic declared independence from Serb-dominated
Yugoslavia. Backed by the Yugoslav army, Serbs, who comprised 13 per cent of
the 4.7m population, took up arms against Croatian independence.
Belgrade Radio said several French peacekeepers were wounded in the fighting
at Zemunik airport. The report could not be independently confirmed. They
said hundreds of refugees were fleeing artillery and mortar barrages in the
area.
Serb commanders in Krajina, the self-proclaimed Serbian state in Croatia,
announced a general mobilisation.
Under the UN peace plan, Serb fighters were supposed to hand over their
weapons to UN supervision to create demilitarised zones. But a UN official
yesterday said Serbs had removed heavy artillery from UN-supervised arms
depots.
Meanwhile fighting was reported throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina. Sarajevo
radio said the old town centre of the besieged Bosnian capital came under
heavy shelling by Serb forces from the surrounding hills. Serb forces
bombarded Mostar, the Croat-held city in south-west Bosnia, said Croatian
radio.
In eastern Croatia, a UN soldier was killed when he stepped on a landmine in
Sector East. He was the 24th UN peacekeeper killed since UN troops were
deployed last March.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Economists in call to let franc float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of private-sector French economists has called for the currency to
be allowed to float against the D-mark, opening up another crack in the
establishment's consensus on the need for a strong franc, David Buchan
writes from Paris.
At this week's Franco-German treaty anniversary celebrations, President
Francois Mitterrand was firmly against any decoupling of the franc from the
D-Mark. Most proponents of a more flexible exchange rate have been
identifiable anti-Europeans. But members of France's National Association of
Doctoral Graduates in Economics have concluded in their latest bulletin that
although it has lower inflation than Germany, France will not succeed in
bringing its interest rates below those of Germany.
These economists are impressed with the three-point fall in UK short-term
rates since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism. Only a
narrowing of the gap between France's low inflation rate and high nominal
interest rates will make it worthwhile for French companies to resume
investing and creating jobs, they argue: if a floating franc means a franc
sinking against the D-Mark, 'it would be better to accept it, as the price
of stopping the asphyxiation of the French economy.'

THE COMMONWEALTH of Independent States yesterday embarked on a two-tiered
future, with only seven of its 10 states agreeing on a charter for closer
political and economic integration. Ukraine, Moldova and Turkmenistan
refused to sign the long-discussed charter to create a defence alliance, an
economic co-ordination committee and an interstate court.
However, all 10 participants at yesterday's summit in the Belorussian
capital of Minsk signed a declaration that any state would be free to sign
up to the charter in future.
Moreover, an interstate bank, seen as crucial for reviving collapsing
interstate trade, was also endorsed by all 10. It is to establish a badly
needed clearing system and provides for the possibility of co-ordinating
credit and monetary policy among the republics that continue to use the
rouble.
The leaders also agreed to set up a common framework for the securities
being issued by republics as part of moves to a market economy.
Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, the Belorussian leader and summit host, told a
news conference: 'I must disappoint those who were predicting the end of the
Commonwealth. We have seen things eye-to-eye as never before.'
Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev said the signatories of the
charter were 'the Commonwealth integrators', thus acknowledging two
different kinds of Commonwealth membership had emerged.
But President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, which has been the most
recalcitrant Commonwealth member, said the states now respected each other's
right to be different: 'There are some questions which can only be decided
in the Commonwealth but others must be left to bilateral relations. Today's
meeting has shown we have begun to respect each other.'
Russian President Boris Yeltsin said: 'We understand we cannot live without
each other even though Russia is better protected. Russia cannot live
without Tajikistan, Ukraine or any other republic.'
The meeting's clearest failure was a rejection of a Russian proposal to take
over nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus.
The next meeting of CIS leaders is to be held in Armenia on April 13.

<TEXT>
RENEWED fighting between Croats, Serbs and Moslems in the former Yugoslavia
yesterday cast a shadow over the Bosnia peace talks in Geneva.
The negotiations, to resume today, are about to deal with the most
controversial element of the international mediators' peace plan - the
detailed map of the ten provinces into which Bosnia will be divided.
Anxious not to lose the momentum of the negotiations, the international
mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen will urge an agreement on the map
during the current session of the talks. They are prepared to draw out the
talks as long as necessary.
However, given the deep disagreements over territory which divide the three
ethnic groups, a more realistic prospect is that the talks will run into the
sand by Tuesday and be adjourned for a few days to allow further bilateral
contacts.
The mediators' plan provides for the creation of an independent, unified
state of Bosnia, divided into 10 largely self-governing provinces. But
though the Croats have already accepted the provincial map, both the Moslems
and Serbs are deeply unhappy with some of the provincial borders.
The Moslems, who accounted for more than 40 per cent of Bosnia's population
before the conflict began last April, are demanding more land than the 26
per cent allocated to them. The mediators, however, have stressed that the
Moslems were mainly city-dwellers and therefore occupied much less land in
relation to the size of their population.
The Serbs, who have been assigned about 43 per cent of Bosnia, do not want
to give up the additional 27 per cent they now occupy as the result of
military conquests and 'ethnic cleansing'. But they might do a deal to
ensure their provinces are linked by land corridors across Croatian
territory.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Spain cuts key rate half a point
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain yesterday gave a strong signal that it believes the peseta
has put its currency troubles behind it. The bank announced a half-point cut
in the key money rate at the repurchase tender of its bank's certificates.
The bank said the decision to bring down the benchmark intervention rate
from 13.75 per cent to 13.25 per cent was 'a response to the progressive
normalisation of the currency markets as they recover from the upsets of the
autumn of 1992'.
The monetary authorities had raised the rate from 13 per cent to 13.75 per
cent on November 23 to shield the peseta against speculators following a 6
per cent devaluation of the currency. The peseta had already been devalued
by 5 per cent two months earlier when the September upheavals in the
European Monetary System forced the pound and the lira out of the system's
exchange rate mechanism.
Yesterday's move by the bank had been expected by the markets, in the wake
of a set of indicators that the peseta had been restored to health.
By the end of December, Spain's reserves, hard hit in the battle to secure
the peseta, improved by nearly Dollars 3bn to finish 1992 with Dollars
50.4bn (Pounds 33.1bn), and the currency has recently remained comfortably
above the Pta72.78 to the D-Mark parity that was set in the November
realignment.
Underlining the peseta's strength, the currency was fixed yesterday at its
parity of Pta70.78 to the D-Mark, down from Pta7.80 before the announcement
of the rate cut. Banco de Santander was the first of the big commercial
banks to lower its preferential lending with a 0.5 cut from 12.95 per cent
to 12.45 per cent.
Fuelling the confidence of the Bank of Spain, price rises slowed appreciably
in the last months of the year to give Spain a 5.4 per cent year-on-year
inflation rate at the end of December. The continuing depressed state of the
economy is likely to bring the rate below 5 per cent early this year.
Anticipating an easing of the intervention rates, there has been a strong
foreign-led rally in the Spanish bond market in recent weeks.
Analysts said there was room for further cuts in the benchmark rate as the
differential in real interest rates between the peseta and the other EMS
currencies remains very high.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Hungary's conservative government hung in the balance last
night as Prime Minister Jozsef Antall battled against a far-right offensive
to take over the ruling party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum.
Mr Antall, a statesman-like moderate who has led Hungary since voters threw
out the communist regime in 1990, put his political career on the line in
his speech yesterday opening the Forum's congress.
Mr Antall, generally regarded as a vital element in Hungary's continuing
stability, threatened resignation if the far-right took over the party
presidium in internal elections last night.
The prime minister appealed to the good sense of the party, saying the
far-right endangered the stability which was Hungary's 'prime asset',
lacking in neighbouring countries.
His speech openly confronted Mr Istvan Csurka, the extremist leader whose
attacks on Jews, communists, liberals, journalists and western companies
have capitalised on discontent over falling living standards, aroused Forum
activists and thrown Hungarian politics into turmoil.
Mr Antall had in the interests of party unity resisted much pressure from
the opposition and the international community to move against the
anti-semitic writer after he launched his explosive manifesto last August.
But the prime minister's resolve appears to have hardened in the days
running up to the congress as the far-right mounted personal attacks and a
serious bid for power within the Forum. 'If somebody draws a sword against
me and the government, I take mine out too: I will not back away,' he said
yesterday.
The clash within the Forum comes at the worst possible time for Mr Antall,
who faces challenges on all fronts. Painful economic reforms, pursued amid a
recession which has seen GDP fall almost 20 per cent in three years, have
proved vastly unpopular. Support for the Forum fell to 8 per cent in a
recent poll, leaving a daunting deficit to make up before elections in
spring next year.
Meanwhile, the two smaller members of the three-party conservative coalition
are both distancing themselves from an unpopular government. To cap it all,
Mr Antall suffers personally from a struggle against cancer and undergoes
periodic chemotherapy.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Jobs top priority for new Copenhagen government

<TEXT>
POLICIES to generate more jobs and reduce Denmark's 11 per cent unemployment
rate will be a top priority for the four-party, majority government which Mr
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, will form
over the weekend.
The SDP leader yesterday received the consent of the three small centre
parties - Radical Liberals, Centre Democrats and Christian People's Party -
to form a coalition government on the basis of a policy document hammered
out this week: 'A programme to engage, enthuse and call on the commitment of
the people.'
The new government will have the narrowest possible majority, 90 of the 179
seats in the Folketing, including the votes of two of the four members
elected for the Faroe Islands and Greenland.
Mr Rasmussen will spend the weekend putting together his cabinet. It is
expected that his new government will be ready to be presented to Queen
Margrethe on Monday.
The three centre parties all supported the outgoing Conservative-Liberal
coalition, which collapsed last week when Prime Minister Poul Schluter
resigned after 10 years in office following criticism over the so-called
Tamilgate scandal. Therefore, no radical changes in the policies of the new
government are expected.
Mr Rasmussen has also chosen to isolate the left-wing Socialist People's
Party (SPP), whose leaders were hoping for a government resting on support
from them, the SDP and the Radicals, another majority combination.
'The SDP has made a right turn,' said Mr Holger Nielsen, SPP leader.
Low inflation, continued membership of the European Community's exchange
rate mechanism, a cautious fiscal policy and a continued 'solid' surplus on
the current external account are among the basic points in the government's
programme. Its headline points are employment, renewal of the welfare state,
the environment and improvement in human rights and democracy around the
world.

<TEXT>
A UK-US consortium of PowerGen and NRG Energy has won an important first
round in an ambitious attempt to become an important German coal and
electricity producer.
The Treuhand privatisation agency decided yesterday to begin negotiations on
selling east Germany's largest brown coal mining company, Mibrag, to the
consortium.
A rival German energy consortium, led by Rheinbraun and including RWE,
PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk, failed to submit a competitive bid,
according to the Treuhand.
PowerGen's move comes at a politically sensitive time for the UK government,
in the middle of a review on how to reprieve some of British Coal's mines.
However, the privatised generator stressed yesterday it had no plans to
import the coal, which would all be used locally.
PowerGen and NRG Energy are understood to have bid nearly DM1bn (Pounds
412m) to buy Mibrag's extensive open-cast mines in the Leipzig area and
planned several billion D-Marks in investments. Mibrag, which produced 36m
tons of brown coal last year, expects to sign contracts shortly to supply
brown coal to several big power stations planned in Saxony. The company's
workforce is to be slashed by 5,500 to 10,500 by the end of this year.
The UK-US consortium also aims to become the first foreign company to
operate power stations in Germany, breaking the fiercely-protected oligopoly
of domestic producers. German electricity rates are among the highest in
Europe and PowerGen and NRG Energy have held out the prospect of producing
cheaper electricity. Both the Treuhand and the German Cartel Office have
expressed interest in obtaining cheaper rates for German industrial and
household users.
The Rheinbraun consortium is also negotiating with the Treuhand to buy the
Laubag brown coal company in nearby eastern Brandenburg state, but progress
has been slow.

THE IRISH government has revealed details of a IPounds 1.1bn (Pounds 1.2bn)
exchange rate guarantee scheme to be used to alleviate financial pressures
on Irish businesses and mortgage holders hit be the recent currency turmoil.
The scheme will consist of two packages, one of IPounds 500m for the
manufacturing, food-processing and tourism industries to reduce their
borrowing costs, and another of IPounds 600m for building societies to avert
a threatened 3 percentage point increase in mortgage rates.
The commercial banks will borrow the funds in D-Marks and then lend them on
to eligible companies at a maximum interest rate of 13.5 per cent. The
building societies will apparently be able to deposit their funds back into
the interbank market at commercial rates, to bring down the average cost of
their borrowings, forced up sharply by the currency crisis.
Some market analysts have expressed doubts about the scheme, which is
expected to be functioning early next week, especially about the ability of
the authorities to 'ring-fence' the funds within the marketplace and prevent
them from being used to fuel a new speculative run on the punt.
The Finance Ministry said yesterday: 'The government will be quite insistent
that there will be very close monitoring of how the funds are used.'
The overall operation of the scheme will be reviewed in three months.

Although the punt strengthened considerably within the ERM this week, the
key one-month money rate in the Dublin interbank market has continued to
hover around 20 per cent, keeping the pressure on banks and lending
institutions. Sterling traded yesterday at close to 1.09 to the punt, as it
continued to weaken on the back of poor economic figures.
Most analysts in Dublin agree it will be extremely difficult for many Irish
exporters to keep their markets in the UK if such an exchange rate is
sustained. This week, leaders of Ireland's timber industry warned that
several thousand jobs might be lost 'within weeks' because of the decline in
orders from the UK.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Economists call for floating franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of private-sector French economists has called for the currency to
be allowed to float against the D-mark, opening up another crack in the
establishment's consensus on the need for a strong franc.
At this week's Franco-German treaty anniversary celebrations, President
Francois Mitterrand was firmly against any de-coupling of the franc from the
D-Mark. Most proponents of a more flexible exchange rate have been
identifiable anti-Europeans. But members of France's National Association of
Doctoral Graduates in Economics have concluded in their latest bulletin that
although it has lower inflation than Germany, France will not succeed in
bringing its interest rates below those of Germany.
These economists are impressed with the three-point fall in UK short-term
rates since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism. Only a
narrowing of the gap between France's low inflation rate and high nominal
interest rates will make it worthwhile for French companies to resume
investing and creating jobs, they argue: if a floating franc means a franc
sinking against the D-Mark, 'it would be better to accept it, as the price
of stopping the asphyxiation of the French economy.'
In fact, the economy does not seem to be choking, according to figures
published yesterday showing a 5.4 per cent rise in manufactured sales in
December. The requirement for higher environmental standards from this month
on led to a surge in car sales at the end of 1992.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Geneva peace talks reach crucial phase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RENEWED fighting between Croats, Serbs and Moslems in the former
Yugoslavia comes as the Bosnian peace talks appeared to have been given a
boost by the Bosnian Serb parliament's acceptance of a constitutional
framework for Bosnia.
The negotiations, due to be resumed in Geneva today, are about to deal with
the most controversial element of the international mediators' peace plan -
the detailed map of the ten provinces into which Bosnia will be divided.
'There are no illusions; the map discussions will be difficult,' Mr Fred
Eckhard, the mediators' spokesman said yesterday.
As with the negotiations last week on the constitutional principles, the
talks will be attended by the top leaders of the rump Yugoslavia, federal
President Dobrica Cosic, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and
Montenegran President Momir Bulatovic. It was President Milosevic's
intervention, in particular, which persuaded the Bosnian Serbs to accept the
constitutional framework.
Anxious not to lose the momentum of the negotiations, the Geneva
conference's co-chairmen, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, will urge an
agreement on the map during the current session of the talks. They are
prepared to draw out the talks as long as necessary.
However, given the deep disagreements over territory which still divide the
three ethnic groups, a more realistic prospect is that the negotiations will
run into the sand by about Tuesday and will be adjourned for a few days to
give an opportunity for further bilateral contacts.
The mediators' plan provides for the creation of an independent, unified
state of Bosnia, divided into 10 largely self-governing provinces. But
though the Croats have already accepted the provincial map, both the Moslems
and Serbs are deeply unhappy with some of the provincial borders.
The Moslems, who accounted for more than 40 per cent of Bosnia's population
before the conflict began last April, are demanding more land than the
approximately 26 per cent which has been allocated to them. The mediators,
however, have stressed that the Moslems were mainly city-dwellers and
therefore occupied much less land than might have been warranted by the size
of their population.
The Serbs, who have been assigned about 43 per cent of the territory of
Bosnia, clearly do not want to give up the additional 27 per cent, which
they now occupy as the result of their military conquests and policy of
'ethnic cleansing.' But they might be prepared to do a deal which would at
least ensure that their provinces are joined up by land corridors across
Croatian terri tory.
At the back of the Bosnian Serbs' minds is that, one day, they will still be
able to create an independent Bosnian Serb republic, in spite of the fact
that the future constitution of Bosnia-Hercegovina rules out such a
solution, unless it is approved by the central government.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Spain cuts key rate as peseta finds calmer waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain yesterday gave a strong signal that it believes that the
peseta has put its currency troubles behind it. The bank announced a
half-point cut in the key money rate at the repurchase tender of its bank's
certificates.
The bank said the decision to bring down the benchmark intervention rate
from 13.75 per cent to 13.25 per cent was 'a response to the progressive
normalisation of the currency markets as they recover from the upsets of the
autumn of 1992'.
The monetary authorities had raised the rate from 13 per cent to 13.75 per
cent on November 23 to shield the peseta against speculators following a 6
per cent devaluation of the currency. The peseta had already been devalued
by 5 per cent two months earlier when the September upheavals in the
European Monetary System forced the pound and the lira out of the system's
exchange rate mechanism.
Yesterday's move by the bank had been expected by the markets, as it came in
the wake of a set of indicators that the peseta had been restored to health.
By the end of December, Spain's reserves, which had been hard hit in the
battle to secure the peseta, improved by nearly Dollars 3bn to finish 1992
with Dollars 50.4bn (Pounds 33.1bn), and the currency has recently remained
comfortably above the Pta72.78 to the D-Mark parity that was set in the
November realignment.
Underlining the peseta's strength, the currency was fixed yesterday at its
parity of Pta70.78 to the D-Mark, down from Pta7.80 before the announcement
of the rate cut. Banco de Santander was the first of the big commercial
banks to lower its preferential lending with a 0.5 cut from 12.95 per cent
to 12.45 per cent.
Fuelling the confidence of the Bank of Spain, price rises slowed appreciably
in the last months of the year to give Spain a 5.4 per cent year-on-year
inflation rate at the end of December. The continuing depressed state of the
economy is likely to bring the inflation rate below 5 per cent in the early
months of this year.
Anticipating an easing of the intervention rates, there has been a strong
foreign-led rally in the Spanish bond market in recent weeks. Spanish debt
held by non-residents rose to Pta1.87bn (Pounds 10.68m) at the end of last
year from a Pta1,600bn low in mid-November and last week alone non-residents
bought Pta155bn of government paper.
The Bank of Spain prepared the ground for yesterday's cut by injecting
Pta596bn into the interbank market on Thursday, against a requirement of
only Pta200bn, which brought the overnight rate down from 14.60 per cent to
14.05 per cent.
Analysts said there was room for further cuts in the benchmark rate as the
differential in real interest rates between the peseta and the other EMS
currencies remains very high. Three month Europeseta rates stand at around
600 basis points higher than the Euromark.
In February last year the intervention rate stood at 12.40 per cent, and the
government, which faces elections this year, will be tempted to bring the
current rate down further if the peseta remains strong and the inflation
figures continue to improve.

FT  23 JAN 93 / New team stresses need to contain inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT governor of the Bank of England last night showed his years of
experience in the Bank's back rooms as he talked of trying to effect gradual
change after he takes over at the end of June.
'I have got to be jolly careful of what I say because I would not want to
present myself as in any sense a revolutionary,' he told a press conference
over his appointment.
Mr George, a heavy smoker, was apologetic about being thrust into the public
eye on an evening when his throat was hoarse. 'It shows you how hard I had
to talk to get the job,' he said.
He said his primary task was the permanent reduction of inflation. Achieving
this was more important than whether the Bank was given formal independence,
but greater operational freedom for the Bank was nonetheless desirable.
'The foremost issue is stability, not for its own sake but because it has
been instability and inflation that has done the damage, that has caused
people to lose their jobs, their homes and their businesses,' he said.
'Compared with that, the question of independence is not that important. The
forms in which we can exert independent influence are various.'
Mr George emphasised the importance he attached to the chancellor's
statement that his task was to reduce inflation.
'We have never before had a clear mandate from government as to what our
role is, not in public,' he said.
He also made clear the tender state of Bank morale. He said the Bank had
been 'sobered' by criticism over its supervision of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, and the undignified exit of Britain from the
exchange rate mechanism.
Despite his voice, Mr George looked at ease compared with Mr Rupert
Pennant-Rea, who confessed he had been 'gob-smacked' to receive a call from
the chancellor yesterday morning asking him to become deputy governor.
Mr Pennant-Rea faced a particularly difficult task at the press conference
because as editor of The Economist he has called for the Bank to be given
independence.
But Mr George emphasised his welcome for an outsider as deputy. 'I absolute
recognise the case for having fresh air brought into the bank. That is
certainly something the political masters that made this appointment will
have been conscious of,' said Mr George.
Mr Pennant-Rea said that 'as a journalist' he supported the Bank being given
independence. 'It is a view I will bring with me to the Bank, recognising,
however, that in the last analysis this is a decision for the politicians,'
he said.
Mr George said the circumstances surrounding Britain's departure from the
ERM last September had been 'uniquely difficult'.
The referendum in France on the Maastricht treaty had given the financial
markets a focal point to speculate against sterling. 'Even with hindsight
there was not much we could have done (to prevent devaluation),' he said.
He accepted that Britain's departure from the ERM, and its poor post-war
record on inflation, had left it with a 'credibility gap' in terms of
convincing financial markets about the soundness of the effort on price
control.
The new sense of independent thinking at the Bank would not lead to changes
'of a qualitative kind' regarding its relationship with the Treasury. There
was an 'open and straightforward' partnership between the two.
But he said he had no plans to order Bank economists to publish their
forecasts which up to now have been kept secret.
Asked about his view of recovery from recession, Mr George said: 'We have
put in place the basis for sustainable expansion over the rest of the 1990s,
similar to that which we saw during the 1980s.
'I am not insensitive to the immediate pressures that individuals and
companies are facing throughout the country. But in the long run it would
not help their prospects - indeed these could be damaged - if we were to go
for an immediate quick fix (to stimulate the economy),' he said.
He ruled out Britain's return to the ERM until the British recession had
ended and until the economic instability elsewhere in Europe triggered by
German unification had subsided.

FT  23 JAN 93 / Lambeth lost Pounds 10m through corruption, chief claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORRUPTION and malpractice, claimed to be on an 'unprecedented' scale, have
cost the south London borough of Lambeth upwards of Pounds 10m, according to
a confidential report by Mr Herman Ouseley, the council's chief executive.
Lambeth council was meeting in emergency session into the early hours this
morning to decide what action to take.
Mr Ouseley's report is a catalogue of work performed without proper
authority, unauthorised redundancy payments, overcharging by the council's
direct-labour organisation (DLO) and by former council employees brought in
as sub-contractors.
Some cases involve double charging. The most serious involve the borough's
housing department. The findings of the report by Mr Ouseley, Lambeth's
chief executive for nearly three years, may be investigated by the Serious
Fraud Squad, whatever action the council itself takes.
The report raises the issue of disbanding the DLO and putting its services
out to tender. Allegations involve officials, council workers and
contractors and go back more than 10 years. Throughout most of the period in
question Lambeth was under the control of a leftwing Labour administration.
Last night, the ruling Labour administration was calling for an independent
inquiry, while opposition councillors were demanding immediate recourse to
the Serious Fraud Squad.
Lambeth's finances have long been in a critical state. It has the highest
poll tax in England - Pounds 425 after capping - and more than Pounds 157m
outstanding in uncollected rents, poll tax and rates.
Mr Steven Whaley, the council's Labour leader, called for a
'no-holds-barred' inquiry by a leading barrister, conceding that the council
had not been sufficiently 'vigorous and vigilant'.
Mr Keith Fitchett, Liberal Democrat leader, said the report reflected 'a
complete breakdown of managerial control in Lambeth, arising from the . . .
debilitating relationship between the Labour party and local government
unions.'

FT  23 JAN 93 / Eddie George to be governor of Bank of England: Positive
reaction in the City Economist editor chosen as deputy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE GEORGE was yes-terday appointed as the next governor of the Bank of
England and said that, for the first time, the Bank had been given a clear
mandate to support the government's fight against inflation.
The announcement of his appointment as head of the UK central bank, made by
the prime minister's office, ends several months of speculation about the
successor to the present governor, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, who has held
the post since 1983 and retires in June.
The new deputy governor will be Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, editor of The
Economist magazine.
Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, said last night: 'I have made clear to the new
governor that his responsibility should be to support the government in our
determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation.'
Mr George said he was delighted that for the first time the government had
given the Bank a clear mandate to support it in the fight against inflation.
Mr George, the current deputy governor, will be only the second governor
drawn from the ranks of the Bank's staff. Aged 54, he joined the Bank in
1962 after leaving Cambridge University. His appointment to one of the most
powerful - and best-paid - UK public sector positions had been widely
predicted. The governor's pay in 1991 was Pounds 155,000.
The choice of Mr Pennant-Rea, 45, as deputy governor was unexpected. He said
last night he had been offered the job only yesterday morning. Mr
Pennant-Rea, who worked at the Bank between 1973 and 1977, is a close friend
of Mrs Sarah Hogg, head of the Downing Street policy unit.
Mr George said of Mr Pennant-Rea's appointment that he 'recognised the case
for bringing fresh air into the Bank'.
Mr George will be in charge of advising the government on its inflation
policy and fund-raising in the UK debt markets. He will also be the leading
spokesman for the City's interests both domestically and internationally and
will have overall responsibility for supervising UK banks.
The choice of Mr George was made by Mr John Major, although Mr
Leigh-Pemberton recommended his selection. The other leading candidate was
Sir David Scholey, chairman of the merchant bank, SG Warburg.
Downing Street signalled that Mr George's professional expertise and his
easy relationship with Mr Major had been crucial factors in his appointment.
One of Mr George's most important roles as deputy governor has been to
advise the Treasury on how and when to intervene in currency markets.
However, the prime minister had not blamed him for sterling's forced
withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism in September.
Mr George is generally regarded as a hawk on inflation. He had doubts about
the wisdom of joining the ERM in 1990 but said last night that for 18 months
the system had worked well.
In the City, his appointment was greeted positively. Mr Brian Pitman, chief
executive of Lloyds Bank, said: 'He is a real professional. We have a high
opinion of him.' Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank,
said: 'Eddie is a very good choice. He is very straight and open to deal
with.'
The appointment was also welcomed by European central bankers and government
officials as a sign that the Bank of England's stewardship would pass into a
safe pair of hands.
At Westminster, Mr Alistair Darling, a Labour Treasury spokesman, said the
opposition 'would not quarrel' with the appointment. Mr George was
'well-respected and very competent'.
What was important was 'not so much the governor as the role of the Bank in
years to come.'

COLEFAX &amp; Fowler Group, the upmarket wallpaper, fabric and furnishing group,
fell into the red in the six months to October 31, turning from pre-tax
profits of Pounds 505,000 to losses of Pounds 192,000.
The shares fell 5p to 33p, a far cry from their 180p high in 1989-90 when
pre-tax profits peaked at Pounds 4m.
Mr David Green, chairman, said the period was 'a little gloomy but the worst
is behind us'.
Although there were few signs of a turnround in trading conditions, the
interim losses were said to be no more than a hiccup, and the balance sheet
was strong.
Turnover declined from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 13.9m. Losses per share were
0.76p, against earnings of 2p, and the interim dividend is reduced from 1.3p
to 0.5p.
Sales in the US, responsible for 50 per cent of turnover, had been weak,
although business in December was stronger, and the group's decorating
operations had suffered in particular.
'The UK market is still tough and Europe is not encouraging,' Mr Green said.
Jane Churchill, the mid-price wallpaper and fabric brand, was showing
improved sales, and the devaluation in sterling would help sales on the
Continent and in the US.
However, only renewed confidence in the housing market would restore the
growth, as sales were largely dependent on people redecorating their homes
as they moved house.

<TEXT>
NIPPON Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, is close to acquiring a 60 per
cent stake in NMB Semiconductor, an ailing Japanese electronics company, in
a deal that highlights the extensive restructuring under way in Japan's
manufacturing industry.
The steel company confirmed negotiations with Minebea, the world's leading
maker of miniature bearings, which founded NMBS in 1984 and still holds 60
per cent. The deal is estimated to be worth Y30bn (Dollars 240m). NMBS is
listed on Tokyo's over-the-counter market.
The Japan Securities Dealers' Association suggested yesterday that it would
investigate recent trading patterns in NMBS shares, which have risen from
Y425,000 to Y958,000 since December 22 on volumes 40 times larger than in
early December. Trading in the shares was suspended yesterday.
NMBS is a maker of memory chips, which have suffered sharp falls in price
over the past two years in an increasingly competitive international market.
It reported a loss of Y12.4bn in the year to September and forecast a loss
of Y4bn this year.
Minebea has transferred managers to the company and pumped in fresh funds
over the past few years, but the bearings maker has been badly bruised by
the collapse of stock prices and the failure of several diversification
projects. Last year, Minebea reported a consolidated loss of Y13.6bn.
For Nippon Steel, the acquisition of NMBS would broaden its electronics
expertise after initial failure in producing personal computers.
Several other Japanese steelmakers, including Kawasaki Steel, Kobe Steel and
NKK, have already begun semiconductor production, but the projects, until
now, have been generally unsuccessful.

There were reports in the Japanese press last year that Intel, the US

flash memory chips, was negotiating with Minebea, but the US company said
yesterday it is not bidding.
Nippon Steel suggested that a new partnership may be formed with another
Japanese electronics company, such as Hitachi, to ensure the revival of
NMBS.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner redeems stock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, yesterday said it
would redeem Dollars 2.5bn worth of convertible preferred stock.
The share buy-back provides firm evidence of the company's previously-stated
intention to reduce its bank debt and the cost of preferred stock dividends,
both of which have been a heavy burden on the balance sheet.
Prior to yesterday's announcement - which will lead to the redemption of 45m
shares of Time Warner's Series D preferred stock - the company had a total
of Dollars 6.5bn of preferred stock outstanding. Dividend payments for this,
which was issued as a result of the 1989 agreement by Time to merge with
Warner Communications, cost the company Dollars 579m in 1991.
Following the Dollars 2.5bn redemption there will still be Dollars 1bn of
Series D and Dollars 3.1bn of Series C preferred stock outstanding. The Time
Warner board yesterday also authorised the future repurchase of the 20m
remaining shares of Series D stock.
The funds for the Dollars 2.5bn buy- back have come from Time Warner's
recent issue of a Dollars 1bn debenture and some Dollars 1.5bn of other debt
securities.
Mr Gerald Levin, Time Warner's newly-named chairman, said the repurchase
would have a positive impact on operating results and would also reduce the
future number of potential outstanding common shares.
The redemption price per share of the 45m Series D 11 per cent convertible
exchangeable preferred stock is Dollars 53.85 plus 53.47 cents of accrued
and unpaid dividends to the redemption date, making for a total of Dollars
54.38 per share.
Time Warner, which has moved to lower its gearing since Mr Levin became sole
chief executive, has other plans to reduce its debt burden. These include
the possible sale of up to Dollars 3bn of non-strategic assets over coming
years.
In late 1991, Toshiba and C. Itoh of Japan committed a total of Dollars 1bn
to buy a 12.5 per cent stake of TWE, Time's film, cable programming and
cable operations assets.
On Wall Street, the price of Time Warner's common stock rose Dollars 1/4 to
close at Dollars 32 3/8.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: GE up 6% with boost from power
systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric of the US reported a 6 per cent increase in fourth-quarter
earnings, helped by an improving domestic economy and strong shipments from
its power systems business.
The company made Dollars 1.34bn, compared with Dollars 1.26bn in the same
period of 1991. Earnings per share rose 8 per cent from Dollars 1.46 to
Dollars 1.57, and revenues rose from Dollars 17.6bn to Dollars 17.8bn.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said GE was 'better positioned than ever before,
with a strong balance sheet, very strong cash-flows and excellent prospects
for earnings growth'.
In 1992 overall, GE's earnings rose 7 per cent to Dollars 4.72bn, while its
share repurchase programme helped lift earnings per share 8 per cent to
Dollars 5.51. Revenues rose 3 per cent to Dollars 62.2bn.
GE estimated that earnings from continuing operations - excluding its
aerospace division, being sold to Martin Marietta - would show a rise of
around 10 per cent.
Mr Welch said the performance in 1992 had been led by double-digit earnings
increases at GE Financial Services, Power Systems and Medical Services.
He added that the year's operating highlight was 'the increasing ability of
the businesses to turn the rhetoric of 'speed' into reality, as demonstrated
by record inventory turnover and productivity of nearly 5 per cent during a
period of slow global growth.
'This not only increased earnings but also translated into a record Dollars
5.3bn in operating cash-flow, some Dollars 1.3bn over 1991 results.'
Earnings at GE Financial Services totalled Dollars 1.499bn for the year, 18
per cent up on 1991's Dollars 1.275bn. GE Capital, the main financial
services arm, saw double-digit earnings growth, and Kidder, Peabody, the
securities house, achieved 'sharply improved' results.

FT  22 JAN 93 / New Nissan Micra on show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Nissan Micra has been put on show this week at the Northern Centre
for Contemporary Art in Sunderland, in a display aimed at highlighting the
artistic merits of the vehicle now rolling off the production line at the
Nissan plant on the edge of the city, writes Chris Tighe.
According to the exhibition organisers and Nissan the curves of butterfly
wings and elephant trunks helped to inspire the lines of the Micra,
currently European Car of the Year.
Mr Mike Hill, director of the centre, said: 'In 1993 more people will look
at a Micra than at a Monet. This exhibition, in a small way, acknowledges
the place of Nissan in the life of Sunderland and the place of design in the
lives of us all.'
To help the public appreciate some hidden features of the Micra's design the
centre is displaying a half model with clear door panels so its window
mechanism can be admired.
The Toyko Nissan team that designed the Micra was guided on European
preferences by Lidewij Edelkoort, a Paris-based Dutchwoman and specialist
adviser to the automotive industry on future design trends.
The exhibition, Micra-Processes, runs until February 20. Admission is free.

FT  22 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Air France in Euro Disney deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, the theme park east of Paris, said yesterday that it had
appointed Air France its sole official airline and would not be renewing
contracts with British Airways, Aer Lingus, Lufthansa and Alitalia, Michael
Skapinker reports.
Euro Disney said that after a year of operation it had decided to abandon
its practice of having a preferred airline in each of its main European
markets. It said it wanted Air France to represent it throughout Europe.
Earlier this month Euro Disney had announced that Mr Robert Fitzpatrick was
resigning as chairman to make way for Mr Philippe Bourguignon, a Frenchman.
The four airlines whose contracts are not being renewed were 'preferred
travel partners', which meant that they were permitted to use Euro Disney
promotional material and logos in their advertising.
Euro Disney said its decision to drop British Airways was not related to
controversy surrounding the UK carrier's 'dirty tricks' campaign against
Virgin Atlantic.
Air France will become Euro Disney's preferred carrier immediately
throughout Europe, except for the UK, Ireland, Germany and Italy, where it
will assume the role from the beginning of April.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas held back by
C-17 side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE improvements in most of its government aerospace programmes, St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas reported 1992 full-year earnings well below
those of 1991 because of large loss provisions for its controversial C-17
military transport programme and lower earnings from its commercial aircraft
segment.
Company executives forecast stronger cash-flow in 1993, with Mr Herbert
Lanese, chief financial officer, stating that cost-cutting and
previously-announced asset sales would generate Dollars 1bn in cash flow
next year. The company's total aerospace debt fell to Dollars 2.77bn at the
end of 1992, down from Dollars 2.86bn on September 30.
'Most of our businesses are now getting good competitive returns by industry
standards,' Mr John McDonnell, McDonnell Douglas chairman said. 'We expect
the C-17 programme to be profitable in 1993, as we complete the transition
from development into production. Except for the C-17 programme, our
government aerospace programmes, as a group, had their best earnings in
corporate history.'
The news boosted McDonnell Douglas stock, which was trading up Dollars 2 1/2
at Dollars 56 1/2 at close of trade.
Before special charges and additions made for a new benefits accounting
rule, McDonnell Douglas reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 86m or
Dollars 2.20 a share, compared with Dollars 211m or Dollars 5.50 a share in
1991. The 1991 results included earnings of Dollars 74m or Dollars 1.93 a
share from discontinued operations and a gain of 83 cents a share from a tax
settlement.
For the full year, the company had earnings of Dollars 161m or Dollars 4.15
a share, down from Dollars 423m or Dollars 11.03 in 1991. Fourth-quarter
sales were Dollars 4.62bn, compared with Dollars 4.68bn last year and
full-year sales were Dollars 17.3bn, compared with Dollars 18.0bn a year
ago.
The company's order backlog on December 31 was Dollars 24bn, against Dollars
30.4bn a year earlier.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Letter: Coal: cabinet tinkering when competition should be
the aim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From I A PATRICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr J D Meads (Letters, January 20) correctly points out that, with no
competition from imported coal or any other energy source, British Coal
could produce 60m tonnes of coal a year profitably. This is not the point.
Competition is fundamental to allow a consumer choice and, regrettably for
coal, competitive sources of fuel are, and must, remain available. Mr Meads
goes on to cast gas as the main culprit for the demise of the UK coal
industry, but care must be taken in making sweeping assertions about an
industry as large and diversified as the offshore gas industry which has
many jobs at stake in the current energy review.
Under the currently contemplated five-year coal contracts, the limit of 40m
tonnes a year falling to 30m tonnes is set by the size of the franchise
market for electricity, of which nearly 40 per cent will by 1995 be
accounted for by those gas-fired generating stations with long-term take or
pay contracts with the regional electricity companies. It is, however,
important to recognise that not all gas-fired power stations supply the
franchise market and those which do not (owned by National Power and
PowerGen) have no impact on the five-year coal contracts under
consideration. The current debate has had a severe and unjustifiable impact
on the development of these stations, such as at Connahs Quay in Clwyd, with
enormous implications for loss of investment and new jobs.
The only thing preventing British Coal increasing its output beyond the
level of the five-year contract is its inability to compete with imported
coal. All our efforts must be directed to making British Coal
internationally competitive rather than trying to shut down competing
industry in the UK particularly at a time when we can ill afford to lose
jobs in any industry, be it coal, nuclear or oil and gas.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs attack pit closure programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT and British Coal were heavily criticised yesterday over the
pit closures programme as a cross-party committee of MPs called for all 31
mines to stay open until there had been full consultation on the economic,
industrial and social consequences for the nation and for communities.
The department of trade and industry under Mr Michael Heseltine was
criticised by the Commons employment committee for secrecy in talks with
British Coal before the announcement, for allegedly failing to consult with
the employment department and for misjudging public opinion.
Mr Greville Janner, committee chairman and Labour MP for Leicester West,
said British Coal had made 'monstrous mistakes not to comply with the law'.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC's new competition commissioner, confirmed that he
may give Britain the flexibility to grant subsidies to the coal industry
until 1995. He stressed that negotiations had not yet begun. His comments to
MEPs on Wednesday did not mean that a deal had been struck.
In a further development two pit unions called off a High Court hearing
after claiming British Coal had withdrawn threats to reduce redundancy
payments to miners after the end of this month.
Mr Janner's criticisms were rejected by Mr Neil Clark, British Coal
chairman, who said it was impossible to go through the normal consultation
process for pit closures - the High Court ruled that the law had been broken
 -without affecting redundancy payments.
The Department of Trade and Industry said it would consider the committee's
report before publishing its white paper on energy, scheduled for next
month. However, the focus of the white paper is the energy market, rather
than the economic and social consequences of pits closures.
The Commons committee of six Conservatives and five Labour MPs called on the
government to take account of the full financial costs of the pit closures,
including the effects on public expenditure, and to publish its findings.
'The true national costs should be taken into account especially when
large-scale redundancies are to be created in a publicly owned industry such
as coal.'
Challenged by MPs on the report at Commons question time, however, the prime
minister countered by saying the government's aim was to create 'a viable
coal industry for the future'.
In criticising the 'secrecy' of British Coal and the DTI in their talks
before the closures announcement, the committee rejected the argument that
the lack of warning benefited employees. Much more time was needed to allow
communities to adjust to a change in the structure of employment, the report
said.
The decision to close the pits could jeopardise the employment of up to
100,000 people, with little hope of alternative jobs, but the employment
minister had had 'little if any role' in the discussions prior to the
closures announcement.
The MPs called for special government assistance to areas with factories
affected by closures but outside 'mining areas'.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Letter: The real nature and scale of IBM's problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DANIEL TRIMMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The FT's various commentaries on IBM and its record losses reflect
widespread misunderstanding as to both the nature and the scale of the
corporation's problems.
IBM's troubles have been brewing for a very long time. For two decades, IBM
has been suffering an erosion of relative market share. For nearly half of
that time, under the chairmanship of John Akers, the profit-spinning
mainframe side of the business has been virtually stagnant. In the computer
industry, these are extremely long time-frames. IBM itself, not being
entirely stupid, has been well aware of the trends. Yet, virtually nothing
effective has been done to meet the changing world.
The commonly cited issue of IBM's size is irrelevant. If IBM grew to be a
certain size by meeting market requirements, it cannot follow that it is
suddenly too big to meet the needs of what are by and large the same
customers. Breaking IBM into smaller units, each with management even worse
than that enjoyed by the corporation overall, will not solve the problem.
The roots of IBM's problems have little to do with technology and everything
to do with culture and ethics. By fostering a paternalistic, conformist
culture which is light-years away from competitive capitalism, and by trying
to tie customers for new types of items to old or proprietary products (in
networking and operating systems, for example), IBM has magnified, not
lessened, its grief.
The corporation's inability to work well with new types of marketeers to
distribute low-end products is part of this 'enclosed' mentality.
IBM's future is indeed grim, but more accurate analysis by the press might
help both computer users and the industry (including IBM) to see the issues
more clearly.

FT  22 JAN 93 / BA buys 19.9% stake in USAir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways yesterday announced it was spending Dollars 300m for a 19.9
per cent stake in USAir, the sixth-largest American carrier, just one month
after it abandoned plans for a more ambitious Dollars 750m investment in the
face of US controversy.
The deal, approved yesterday by both companies' boards, forms an important
part of BA's strategy of becoming the world's biggest global carrier. For
the lossmaking, heavily debt-laden USAir, it means a valuable cash injection
and greater access to the international market.
However, while the transfer of funds to USAir took place yesterday, the deal
still needs the backing of the US government and will face opposition from
other US carriers.
Rival airlines opposed the earlier BA deal, which would have given the
British company a 44 per cent stake in USAir and a substantial say in
strategic decision-making. They argued the pact should be blocked unless
there was greater US access to London's Heathrow airport.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United Airlines, repeated this yesterday,
saying the new BA investment 'must be carefully scrutinised by the US
government and only sanctioned when the UK government lifts the barriers to
competition . . . for US flag-carriers.'
The new deal gives BA a stake well within the 25 per cent legal limit for
foreign ownership of a US airline. It may be hard for the new Clinton
administration to justify blocking it, since it is similar to two deals
approved by the Bush government, which allowed KLM, the Dutch carrier, to
take a minority stake in Northwest Airlines and Air Canada to do likewise at
Continental Airlines.
The new BA deal would allow BA the option - US law permitting - to inject up
to Dollars 450m more into USAir, taking its equity stake up to 32.4 per
cent.
Three BA directors will join a 16-person USAir board, but they will not have
the say in important company matters that was written in to the original
agreement, nor will the two companies integrate their services as closely as
first planned.
They said yesterday they would first implement a new 'code-sharing' plan,
under which USAir flights from US cities will link at key gateways with BA
transatlantic flights.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM may begin a series of state asset sales this year by selling two
public credit institutions and several industrial assets to raise Bfr25bn
(Dollars 751m) a finance ministry official said, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
The two public banks are the country's biggest savings bank, ASLK-CGER, and
the industrial credit bank, NMKN-SNCI.
'These are the assets that are under consideration,' the official said,
quoting the finance minister, Mr Philippe Maystadt. He said Mr Maystadt
received a list of companies for possible privatisation in 1993 from the
Maldague Commission, an advisory body on the sell-off.
The government also plans to sell a stake in mortgage company, OCCH-CBHK.
The industrial assets for sale are stakes held by the state holding company,
SNI-NIM, in the natural gas company, Distrigaz, the holding company,
Nationale Portfeuillemaatschapij, the National Pipeline Company, and the
Societe Publique d'Electricite.
The nuclear energy company, Belgonucleaire, is also on the list.
The centre-left government of the prime minister, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene,
intends to use the sale of state assets to cut the huge budget deficit.
The Finance Ministry later said that the Maldague Commission has not yet set
minimum prices for the assets. State companies to be sold after 1993 are yet
to be studied by the commission, it added.

FT  22 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) International Bonds: Investors remain positive
towards the dollar sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (Published 25th January 1993) appended to this article.
CORPORATE and bank issuers dominated the Eurobond market yesterday, with
deals spread across a variety of currencies.
The lowering of asset quality partly reflects growing investor appetite for
higher yielding paper, as interest rates edge further down.
Dealers said there had been a lack of higher-yielding corporate debt in the
dollar sector. Investors remain very positive on the dollar market, but the
low interest rates in the sector appear to be fuelling demand for slightly
higher yields, as was the pattern in the US market throughout last year. So
far this year, only triple-A rated companies such as Nippon Telegraph &amp;
Telephone and General Electric Capital Corporation have tapped the dollar
sector.
Consequently, yesterday's Dollars 200m five-year issue for Electrolux, the
A3-rated Swedish white goods manufacturer, was welcomed by dealers.
'It is the right sort of asset: lower credit quality, and higher spread,'
said one underwriter, 'but the name could have been better.'
However, the indicated pricing of the bonds to yield 106 basis points over
the when-issued five-year Treasury was considered fair. The deal, arranged
by Lehman Brothers International, is due to be priced today.
In the sterling market, the Leeds Permanent Building Society launched a
Pounds 150m issue of subordinated bonds due February 2018, via Credit Suisse
First Boston. The deal did not suffer as a result of the weakness of
sterling yesterday, since it was aimed at domestic institutions. The
A2-rated issue was priced to yield 140 basis points over the comparable
gilt, again appealing to investors' appetite for extra yield.
In the Dutch guilder market, CSFB Finance launched a Fl 250m issue due 2000,
via CSFB Nederland, which met strong demand due to lack of supply in the
sector. Dealers said that the lack of swap opportunities - and of borrowers
with a natural requirement for guilders - has severely restricted supply, in
spite of investor interest in the market.
A FFr1bn offering for Thomson-Brandt via Credit Commercial de France met
reasonable demand, dealers said. The issue was priced to yield 77 basis
points over the comparable French government bond.
Turnover on Euroclear, the international securities clearing house, reached
a record Dollars 10,000bn last year, up 71 per cent, reflecting higher
international securities trading volume. Average daily transaction volume in
the secondary market reached Dollars 50bn in the fourth quarter, compared
with Dollars 32bn for the first three quarters. The high level of activity
will result in rebates of Dollars 12bn for market participants, double the
1991 rebate level.
Chemical Banking has filed a shelf registration with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for up to Dollars 3bn of debt securities and warrants,
Reuter reports. The amount is part of a Dollars 3.1bn offering, of which
Dollars 100m was previously registered.
CORRECTION
Market participants will receive rebates from Euroclear, the international
securities clearing house, of Dollars 12m. The figure reported in Friday's
edition was incorrect.

<TEXT>
DEH, Greece's public power corporation, has awarded a Dr82bn (Pounds 256.5m)
contract to build a lignite-fired power plant in northern Greece to an
international consortium led by Ansaldo, the Italian engineering company.
Ansaldo's bid for the turnkey project was considerably lower than the
Dr105bn offer submitted by GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French group. It was also
below DEH's own estimate of around Dr89bn.
The project will be financed through funds from the public investment
budget, and some foreign borrowing.
It is likely to be the last Greek power station financed by DEH, a
state-owned enterprise burdened with some Dollars 2.5bn in foreign currency
debts. Other power projects currently being negotiated are to be carried out
under a build-own-operate-transfer (Boot) system, which the government is
keen to develop.
The other members of the Ansaldo consortium are Waagner Biro of Austria and
Aegek, a Greek engineering company.
A third bid from a Russian-Serbian consortium was not opened because of a
United Nations embargo on doing business with Serbia, the official said.

<TEXT>
FOURTH-quarter earnings from banks in New England and the Midwest offered
further evidence of the US industry's profits recovery, spurred by wider
interest margins and reduced levels of problem property loans.
Fleet Financial Group of Providence, Rhode Island, had 1992 fourth-quarter
net income of Dollars 82m (52 cents a share), against Dollars 35m (22 cents)
in the last quarter of 1991.
Fleet's full-year earnings were Dollars 280m (Dollars 1.77 per share), up
sharply on Dollars 98m (67 cents) in 1991.
Non-performing assets were reduced by Dollars 619m during 1992, to Dollars
990m, thanks largely to the sale of problem assets.
Shawmut National of Hartford, Connecticut, reported Dollars 10.3m (8 cents
per share) of net income in the fourth quarter, up from Dollars 2.4m (2
cents) a year before.
Shawmut's full-year 1992 net profit was Dollars 75.2m (81 cents) compared
with a loss of Dollars 170.6m (Dollars 2.35) in 1991.
Non-performing loans and foreclosed property declined last year by 19 per
cent at Shawmut, to Dollars 862.4m.
Mr Joel Alvord, chairman of Shawmut, called 1992 'a watershed year'.
He attributed much of the recovery to rising interest income and the
resolution of problem assets.
In Chicago, Continental Bank said it had earned net profits of Dollars 222m
(Dollars 3.44 per share) for the whole of 1992, compared with a loss of
Dollars 76m (Dollars 2.08) in 1991.
Continental's fourth-quarter net profits were Dollars 61m (95 cents a
share), up from Dollars 50m (77 cents) a year before.
On Wall Street, Fleet's stock closed at Dollars 34, down Dollars  1/8 ;
Shawmut was down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 19 7/8 , while Continental rose
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 21 7/8.

by 11.8%

<TEXT>
BANCO SANTANDER, the Spanish bank, raised net income by 11.8 per cent in
1992 to Pta66.1bn (Dollars 585m).
The result gave the bank a 1.1 per cent return on assets during last year
and a 20.34 per cent return on equity.
Santander, which is a significant shareholder in Royal Bank of Scotland and
of First Fidelity Bancorporation of the US, raised the fee income from its
domestic banking operations by 21.8 per cent to Pta69bn, and restricted the
growth of its operating expenses to 3.5 per cent.
In spite of the lowered allocation for depreciation and provisions,
Santander has a 101.43 per cent coverage of non-performing loans and remains
the best-protected bank in the domestic sector against such losses.
Santander is being investigated over its use of an alleged tax avoidance
instrument called loan assignments between 1988-89. However, a judge at
Madrid's senior monetary court last week revoked a controversial order that
had forced the bank, just before Christmas, to post a Pta8bn bond as surety
against possible fraud charges.
Caja de Madrid, Spain's second-largest savings bank, reported pre-tax
profits of Pta39.2bn for last year, an increase of 11.5 per cent on 1991,
after raising provisions for bad debts by 52.7 per cent to Pta25.3bn. It
said the sharp rise in provisioning reflected a cautious policy rather than
a significant increase in bad debts. The latter represented 2.7 per cent of
total loans.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Talks over controlling stake in
IMI collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS of tortuous negotiations for Italy's savings banks to buy a
controlling stake in IMI, the treasury-controlled financial group, have
collapsed.
This leaves the way open for Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank that is
the largest such institution in the country, to bid for the treasury's 50
per cent stake, valued at L4,000bn (Dollars 2.73bn). The government is under
pressure to obtain an early sale since the revenues were intended to form
the bulk of privatisation proceeds in the 1992 budget.
The deal originally envisaged Cariplo and ICCRI, the savings banks' umbrella
institute, jointly acquiring the treasury's 50 per cent in IMI on an equal
basis through a holding company, Fincasse.
ICCRI, in view of the L2,000bn price for its 25 per cent in IMI, persuaded
the treasury to make a new offer. This would have involved Cariplo and ICCRI
paying L3,200bn for 42 per cent of IMI, split equally in Fincasse.
ICCRI balked at the price, but the deal foundered because the savings banks
were convinced that Cariplo intended to have the controlling hand  - a
concern that surfaced last Wednesday, when Cariplo insisted on having the
presidency of Fincasse and giving this office a double vote on the board.
'ICCRI was being asked to pay the same money but risked being treated as a
passive partner,' said one banker familiar with the deal. Some also suspect
that Cariplo has long wanted to bid for the entire treasury stake, which
would have created Italy's third-largest banking and finance group.
Mr Guido Carli, the previous treasury minister and former governor of the
Bank of Italy, strongly promoted the sale of IMI to the savings banks,
believing there was a natural synergy. The sale also promised to encourage
the process of concentration within the fragmented network of
regionally-based savings banks, of which there are around 80.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ilva chief quits ahead of
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GIOVANNI Gambardella, the chief executive of Ilva, Italy's state steel
group, yesterday announced his resignation 24 hours before a special meeting
called to consider losses in 1992 close to L2,000bn (Dollars 1.36bn).
In a brief note, Mr Gambardella, who presided over the birth of Ilva in
1988, said he was making way for new blood having carried out a specific
phase in the reorganisation of the state steel business. However, the abrupt
nature of his departure was underlined by a curt statement from IRI, the
state holding company that controls Ilva.
The statement made no reference to his record in establishing Ilva, from the
confused remains of the former state-run steel sector centred round
Finsider. It merely said an interim board would operate until January 23,
when a new management would be considered.
The full extent of Ilva's losses in 1992 are understood to have only become
known to IRI very recently. At the beginning of the year, Ilva was
indicating losses would be in the region of L1,000bn to L1,300bn as a result
of a depressed market, high finance costs and low prices in the
international steel market. But yesterday IRI officials indicated the figure
to be announced today would be close to L2,000bn. This compared with a
modest L115bn profit only two years earlier.
IRI stressed Ilva's restructuring plan would proceed as planned.

Italia, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The company, with an initial L7bn (Dollars 4.8m) capital, will manage the
valuation and sale of those property assets deemed worth selling.
The Ministry of Finance has so far examined 10,000 of the 16,000 potential

Of these, roughly half could be sold, with an approximate value of L1,000bn.
Immobiliare will begin with public sector shareholders or those financial

<TEXT>
SHARES in Vard, the Norwegian ferry and cruise group, have tumbled by nearly
20 per cent on the Oslo bourse since Monday following reports that its board
is divided over a strategy to break up the group, writes Karen Fossli in
Oslo.
Vard was also hit by a gloomy forecast from Alfred Berg, a Scandinavian
analyst, which Vard executives rejected as unfounded. Vard shares closed
down NKr2 to NKr29.50 (Dollars 4.33) in Oslo yesterday, having started the
week at NKr37.
The decline has also been spurred by the rejection of an offer of more than
NKr1bn by a group of investors, led by a Vard board member, to acquire the
ferry business. Talks are said to be still under way.
Analysts said Vard's board was split over selling the ferry business, which
generates earnings, before disposing of the cruise business. Vard's cruise
business accounts for the greatest portion of overall group debt.
The company has repeatedly denied that it has financial problems, but has
said that it was working on its companies' financing in order to secure a
debt maturity profile more in accordance with the life expectancy of their
cruise and ferry fleets.

which will continue to be run by its founder and sole shareholder, Mr Dewey
Sadka, finds temporary jobs for some 15,000 workers a year.
Randstad, which was floated on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in 1990, said it
would use its financial strength and know-how to help Temp Force expand. The

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Overhaul at SE Banken to split
operations into three
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, is
splitting its operations into three parts as part of an extensive overhaul
of activities.
A special division will be set up to house the bank's non-performing loans,
following a model adopted by other loss-making Swedish banks.
Another division will cover private individuals and small/medium-sized
businesses and the third division will be for large companies.
Senior management changes and a streamlining of the group's regional
structure are also being implemented. A new credit organisation will also be
built up.
SE Banken said the reorganisation would mean fewer division levels, stronger
customer orientation and strengthened credit organisation.
Its move follows the contact between the bank and the government about
possible state support, which was announced last month.
Mr Bjorn Svedberg, group chief executive, said: 'Together with our
discussions with the Ministry of Finance concerning the forms of our
possible use of government support, the changes we are now introducing are
an important step towards reaching the overall goal of emerging from the
present crisis as a strong bank, with the best possible chances of regaining
profitability and instilling confidence.'
He stressed that the group would remain unified, dismissing rumours that it
would be split into two separate banks.
In the first eight months of 1992 the bank recorded a SKr2.61bn (Dollars
361m) operating loss, with non-performing loans amounting to SKr11.9bn.
SE Banken said all non-performing loans above a certain size would be put
into the special division, as would pledges, in the form of property and
shares, which the bank has taken over. The bank's property company,
Diligentia, will be part of this division, which will be chaired by Mr Arne
Ogren.
Activities in the bank's Sweden division, which will focus on the private
market and small/medium-sized companies, will be divided into six regions
from the present 10. This division will be headed by Mr Lars Gustafsson,
currently head of Treasury operations.
It will include some Swedish subsidiaries, trust and securities business and
credit and charge card operations.
The corporate finance division, which will be headed by Mr Anders
Hedenstrom, will cover corporate finance and will lead to increased
co-operation between Enskilda and the other functions of SEB International.
'A very effective and highly competent organisation is created in this way,
ready to serve large client companies in Sweden and the Nordic countries in
competition with international banks,' the bank said.
One casualty of the changes will be Mr Rutger Barnekow, who will be leaving
his position as group deputy chief executive.
SE Banken's announcement contained no word on job cuts, branch closures and
disposals which many analysts had expected.
Saab Automobile said yesterday it was in the process of selling its car
dealership chain, Saab-Ana, in a move which partly reflects the new sales
strategy the group has adopted since it became half owned by General Motors
of the US.
Saab said it no longer needed its own Swedish sales network because most of
its dealerships had been amalgamated with those of Opel, part of GM.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Move for council tax to be in RPI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COUNCIL TAX and package holidays abroad should be included in the retail
prices index, the main measure of inflation, an advisory committee told the
government yesterday.
The retail prices advisory committee said the council tax should be included
in the RPI from April to replace the community charge, or poll tax, in the
index. Package holidays, which so far have not figured in the RPI, should be
included from the beginning of this year.
One committee member - Mr Samuel Brittan, chief economic commentator of the
Financial Times - dissented from the recommendation on the council tax,
arguing that it was a direct tax and therefore should not be included in a
measure of inflation.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said he would announce his response to the
recommendations 'in due course'.

FT  22 JAN 93 / British Gas to cut 1,240 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas is cutting 1,240 jobs from its headquarters staff as part of a
rationalisation programme that will save Pounds 30m a year. It is also
freezing salaries this year for board members although performance-related
bonuses will not be affected.
The moves come amid continuing cost pressures on British Gas as it faces
increasing competition in its industrial market. Mr Cedric Brown, British
Gas's chief executive, said yesterday the aim was to make management more
effective and efficient.
The company said it planned to achieve the job cuts by voluntary
redundancies over the next five months and will put a freeze on external
recruitment.
British Gas will also slim its corporate centre by moving research and
technology functions to its new research station at Loughborough,
Leicestershire, and will contract out many of its engineering construction
functions.
Mr Brown said: 'We want the corporate centre to focus closely on the
company's strategic direction and devolve responsibility to the business
units to manage their own affairs.'
British Gas comprises three business units: UK gas business, exploration and
production and global gas.
The rationalisation programme will cost about Pounds 70m and the company
expects it to pay for itself in 18 months to two years.
The number of headquarters staff based in London will be reduced to 460 from
3,700. The company will close two research stations in London and one in
Solihull, West Midlands. Research and technology staff will be cut by about
500 from 1,600. Engineering construction personnel will be cut by about 500
from 1,200. The rest of the redundancies will be met from support staff at
the corporate headquarters.
The company says it has put together a redundancy package which guarantees a
minimum of 26 weeks' pay for all employees.
British Gas is involved in pay negotiations with its industrial workers
which could lead to staff being awarded a pay rise while board directors
have their pay frozen this year.
Mr Brown stressed that the company was setting a range of tough targets for
managers performance bonuses.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Move to open market in peak energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS is discussing with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission the
creation of a market for trading peak loads of gas as a way of maintaining
cheap prices for big industrial users.
The commission, which is reviewing British Gas's UK business, is encouraging
the company to find ways of opening the so-called interruptible market to
rivals without jeopardising the low prices on offer in that market. Large
energy consumers which pay 'bargain basement' prices in that market in
return for being cut off during times of peak demand are worried that prices
will have to rise as British Gas yields part of its market share to its
competitors.
Mr Tony Mitchell-Harris of English China Clays, who represents gas users on
the Major Energy Users' Council, said: 'It is absolutely essential for the
viability of British industry that prices in the interruptible market stay
where they are now.'
Competitors to British Gas have secured about 50 per cent of the firm
contract market - where prices are higher and consumers do not run the risk
of being cut off - but none has so far penetrated the interruptible market.
Interruptible gas users pay about 17p a therm compared with 20p to 40p a
therm in the firm market.
Rival suppliers argue that interruptible prices will have to rise to
encourage competition. British Gas is obliged to shed part of its market
share of interruptible sales to fulfil undertakings the company has made to
the Office of Fair Trading on giving up 60 per cent of its share of the
whole industrial market by 1995.
Mr Ian Powe, chairman of the Gas Consumers' Council, told a conference in
London yesterday that British Gas 'will very probably put up the price of
interruptible gas. The price will rise until it reaches a convergence either
with alternative fuel or with a price that is attractive to competitors
supplying firm gas.'
Rival suppliers say this means the price will have to increase by at least
3p a therm. Mr Powe said this would adversely affect large industrial
consumers and inhibit their ability to compete with other EC member states.
The commission is looking at ways of balancing peak supplies in a form of
spot market, although discussions are still at a very early stage.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Monopolies chief defends reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRITICISM of recent reports from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for
bowing too much to the views of the industries under investigation has been
dismissed as ill-informed by Sir Sydney Lipworth, the departing commission
chairman.
Presenting his final annual report, Sir Sydney yesterday defended the
commission's report on new cars published last February against attacks from
consumer organisations.
He said the criticism arose because the report's findings had not matched
public expectations on differences between new car prices in the UK and
elsewhere in the EC.
Much of what the report said had been overlooked. It was detailed and
complex and it was clear that not everyone had understood it, he said.
Sir Sydney said: 'The MMC is a first-rate institution doing a first-rate
job.' As an 'economic tribunal' the commission had long experience and was
well equipped to take on new types of work, he added.
The strongest attack on the report on cars had come from the Consumers'
Association. This prompted media criticism of the inconsistent approach
adopted by the commission towards beer, petrol and car reports.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Japanese translate English village
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE businessmen attending a language school 90 miles north-west of
Tokyo are to get a touch of Olde England.
A reproduction Elizabethan village complete with public house, bowling green
and village hall is to be shipped in pieces from Britain and re-assembled in
Shirakawa.
Boarder Oak Design &amp; Construction, a family-owned Herefordshire company, has
a won a Pounds 4.1m contract from the Sano Educational Foundation to
construct the village which will house up to 400 students.
Ten oak-beamed houses, each a replica of a small Tudor manor house, must be
built to withstand earthquakes, hurricanes and up to six feet of snow which
blankets the ski resort in winter.
Mr John Greene, Border Oak's managing director, said: 'The idea is to
encourage students not only to speak English but to feel English.'
The public house, which will include bar games such as darts and skittles,
is expected to provide traditional English ales and pub food such as pork
pies.
'The educational foundation intends to encourage English eccentricity and
inventiveness,' Mr Greene said.
The development on 60 acres will include two tithe barns which will be used
as workshops for traditional crafts, a 350ft-long brick and flint manor
house, formal gardens, Roman baths and ornamental lake.
About 1,000 commercially grown English oak trees, up to 200 years old, have
been felled for the project by Henry Venables of Stafford.
The first house should arrive at Shirakawa at the end of March. Border Oak
is sending four craftsmen to Japan to assist Obayashi, the large Japanese
construction group, with assembly.

FT  22 JAN 93 / New Nissan Micra on show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Nissan Micra has been put on show this week at the Northern Centre
for Contemporary Art in Sunderland, in a display aimed at highlighting the
artistic merits of the vehicle now rolling off the production line at the
Nissan plant on the edge of the city, writes Chris Tighe.
According to the exhibition organisers and Nissan the curves of butterfly
wings and elephant trunks helped to inspire the lines of the Micra,
currently European Car of the Year.
Mr Mike Hill, director of the centre, said: 'In 1993 more people will look
at a Micra than at a Monet. This exhibition, in a small way, acknowledges
the place of Nissan in the life of Sunderland and the place of design in the
lives of us all.'
To help the public appreciate some hidden features of the Micra's design the
centre is displaying a half model with clear door panels so its window
mechanism can be admired.
The Toyko Nissan team that designed the Micra was guided on European
preferences by Lidewij Edelkoort, a Paris-based Dutchwoman and specialist
adviser to the automotive industry on future design trends.
The exhibition, Micra-Processes, runs until February 20. Admission is free.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Rise in house sales reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE sales agreed in December jumped by more than 18 per cent compared with
the corresponding month last year, according to a survey of 30 of the
country's largest estate agency chains.
The survey by the Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agency provides the
clearest evidence yet of a revival in sales which housebuilders say has
continued during the first few weeks of this year.
The agents, which handle about half of all UK house transactions, agreed
more than 27,000 sales last month compared with just under 23,000 in
December 1991. An agreed sale is only recorded if finance has been arranged,
solicitors have been instructed and no chain is involved. It is the first
time that agents' sales have been disclosed on this scale.
Some of the December improvement is likely to be due to buyers reviving
purchases which they had delayed or postponed during the autumn sterling
crisis.
The number of contracts exchanged during December, reflecting a sharp drop
in sales agreed during September, fell to 20,400 last month compared with
24,400 in December 1991. Mr Peter Constable, chairman, says the rise in new
sales 'indicates some increase in confidence although volumes remain low'.
Estate agents and builders have been cautious about interpreting the recent
rise in sales as the beginning of a more sustained recovery in the housing
market. They warn that fears of rising unemployment together with the
estimated 200,000 empty properties still on the market waiting to be sold
may inhibit a recovery.

FT  22 JAN 93 / SIB warns over regulatory body
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL financial services firms have little choice but to join a new
proposed self-regulatory body which will set tougher standards for the
industry generally and for life insurance in particular, the City's chief
regulator warned yesterday.
Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, said: 'We
want there to be a new retail regulator, capable of accommodating all kinds
of producers and all kinds of distribution for this most important group of
products, the life products.'
His remarks, made in a speech to the Life Insurance Association, stopped
short of spelling out exactly what SIB will do if the banks, insurance
companies, independent and tied sales agents fail to agree to approve the
new body in sufficient numbers.
He said that whether or not it was approved, it was clear that regulatory
standards would have to rise.
Also, the cost of regulation would rise, the financing of compensation to
investors would continue to be expensive and contentious and the public
would continue its clamouring for tougher regulation.
He said firms that tried to avoid joining the new body - the Personal
Investment Authority - by seeking direct regulation from SIB, would find it
no soft option.
'I believe that all this will make for a somewhat unstable situation to say
the least, the consequences of which I don't propose to try to predict
today,' he said.
Meanwhile Mr Large signalled he was not prepared to compromise significantly
on the minimum standards the PIA is expected to set for new members.
Independent financial advisers have reacted angrily to the proposal that
each have minimum capital of Pounds 10,000. Mr Large said it was not
unreasonable for those purporting to give broad-based financial advice to be
able to demonstrate such resources.
Mr Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the
life insurance industry, said at the same conference that in the coming year
there will be considerable pressure to change the front-end commission
structure of sales agents to a new formula of 'salary with bonus'.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Accounts survey finds summaries preferred
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST SHAREHOLDERS prefer using summary financial statements rather than
companies' full annual reports, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales said yesterday.
But its financial reporting committee, which commisioned a survey into
summaries and full reports, recommended that the Department of Trade and
Industry should make the regulations on reports more flexible so they could
be easier to read.
The survey showed that for most companies offering summary statements, more
than 90 per cent of shareholders opted for them in preference to the annual
report.
The findings will fuel arguments that the Accounting Standards Board must do
more to prepare statements which meet the demands of the majority of users
of accounts.
Mr Roger Hussey, of the University of the West of England, who conducted the
research, said: 'We should recognise that annual reports are not a
general-purpose document for the general reader.'
The survey showed that most companies offering summary reports did so to
help communication with shareholders. They had also on average saved costs
of 20 per cent to 33 per cent.
Relatively few companies have yet produced summary statements - just 11 of
the 350 largest quoted industrial companies in 1991, according to a separate
study due to be published later this year.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Revenue backs down on benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue is to pay up to Pounds 30m to people who have paid too
much tax on benefits following a ruling in the Lords last year.
It will also be forced to drop a number of disputed assessments worth many
more millions of pounds with companies which have argued over the taxation
of these benefits.
The Revenue said yesterday it would refund employees who have paid tax based
on more than the marginal cost of their in-house benefits - the additional
costs to their employer of providing the benefit.
It added that it was already making special arrangements for reimbursements
to more than 100,000 British Rail and 40,000 London Transport employees who
get subsidised travel, and was in discussions for similar settlements with
airline staff. It is also believed to be holding talks with ferry operators
and the Confederation of British Industry.
Others who are eligible for refunds include teachers taxed while paying 15
per cent or more of a school's normal fees. Employees receiving professional
services which do not require additional employees to perform or buying
goods sold for at least the wholesale price will also benefit.
The move reflects the ruling against the Revenue in the Lords last November
in the case known as Pepper vs Hart, which concerned the tax assessed on the
reduced rate tuition of a child of a teacher at Malvern College. The Revenue
said it should be assessed on any reduced rate payment below the average
cost.
The Revenue stressed that ministers were considering a possible change in
the law.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Union official to appeal over suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POWER struggle over strategy and political direction is threatening the
stability of Britain's fifth largest union - the 600,000-strong
Manufacturing Science and Finance Union.
The increasingly bitter wrangling could today lead to the dismissal of Mr
Jack Carr, the union's assistant general secretary. He was suspended just
before Christmas by Mr Roger Lyons, the union's general secretary, who
accused him of 'gross misconduct' in the handling of the union's finances.
Mr Carr is appealing against the decision today before a panel of the
union's executive. If he loses he faces dismissal as a full-time official
after 18 years of service.
Yesterday Mr Carr said he would take his case 'all the way' to defend his
'credibility and reputation'. He said Mr Lyons had started 'a political
cleansing of the union' and that other officials were facing discrimination.
Although Mr Lyons is careful to make it clear that Mr Carr is not guilty of
any personal dishonesty, he says that the assistant general secretary
dispensed with an estimated Pounds 300,000 of the union's money to retiring
officials without telling the executive.
The most serious case involves the union's former general secretary, Mr Ken
Gill, who left with a retirement package worth about Pounds 200,000. When
the matter came to light, Mr Gill agreed to a Pounds 60,000 reduction in the
value of his retirement terms.
Mr Carr would not go into the details of his case yesterday pending the
appeal hearing, but the row is only part of a much wider conflict that has
been in existence since the MSF came into being five years ago after the
merger of ASTMS, the white-collar conglomerate created by Mr Clive Jenkins,
and TASS, the technical and administrative workers union, with a strong
presence in white-collar engineering.
The battle for domination in the union is between two cultures. ASTMS was a
loose-limbed, almost anarchically run union with a stylish populist approach
that worked well in the boom years of the 1960s and 1970s but less so in the
recession. TASS was more businesslike, disciplined and centralised, run by a
cadre of tough-minded professionals grounded in the ideology of the class
war.
The predominantly ASTMS faction - under the banner 'MSF for Labour' - says
it wants to rescue the union from what it sees as a Leninist legacy of
bureaucratic centralism. Mr Lyons, a former ASTMS official, wants to take
MSF into a mainstream trade union position and free it from 'unreconstructed
Stalinists'.
He denies strongly that there is any political motive in his action against
Mr Carr.
But Unity Left, the TASS-dominated grouping in the union, has accused Mr
Lyons and his allies of launching a witch-hunt against their ideological
enemies.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Insolvency regime to be tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is forcing substantial changes to the
regulation of insolvency practitioners following the discovery of widespread
failures to comply with regulations.
A random inspection by the DTI's Insolvency Service of about 55 insolvency
practitioners last year found that half were failing seriously to meet their
statutory requirements under the 1986 Insolvency Act.
A total of 10 per cent of those inspected generated very serious
disciplinary problems which led to the withdrawal of licences and criminal
prosecutions, according to a confidential report prepared by regulators last
year.
The investigation has led to mounting pressure in the last few months from
the DTI on the professional insolvency bodies to launch regular, random
inspections of the individuals under their charge.
Plans are now well advanced for a joint insolvency monitoring unit which
could be operating by late summer and will inspect all the UK's 2,000
licensed practitioners every three years.
It is expected to employ nine staff and have an annual budget of at least
Pounds 400,000, jointly funded by the UK's four chartered and certified
accountancy bodies and the Institute of Practitioners of Insolvency, which
between them monitor two-thirds of practitioners. The other two bodies, the
Scottish and English Law Societies, may also participate.
Among the requirements of the 1986 insolvency act was that all practitioners
should be registered with one of these professional bodies in a response to
concern over the number of 'cowboys' operating in the industry.
Until now they have concentrated on registering new practitioners and have
only inspected members in response to complaints received. The DTI told the
professional bodies last year that this was not an adequate response.
The DTI acted after it found many serious regulatory breaches among the 150
practitioners it monitors directly, including not filing directors'
disqualification reports and estate accounting returns, or not paying funds
into the statutory insolvency services account. Some practitioners have been
deregistered and others disciplined as a result.

THE Industrial Society says the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit for the

Mrs Rhiannon Chapman, director of the independent advisory and training

manner guaranteed to provoke a hostile reaction from those who could
plausibly see themselves as its victims'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the consumer goods giant, has been criticised over
advertising claims for Ariel Ultra, one of its branded soap powders.
The Independent Television Commission received complaints disputing the
implied claim that Ariel Ultra would always remove fat from garments at 40
degrees centigrade.
The ITC concluded that Ariel should normally work as advertised, but the
advertising referred to other washing powders, suggesting they failed to
work completely, implying that Ariel would always work in all circumstances.
P&amp;G was unable to establish this claim to the satisfaction of the ITC.
P&amp;G said it was taking steps to modify its advertising.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Internal watchdog plan for banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS MAY be asked by the Treasury to appoint internal ombudsmen to deal
with complaints from small business customers, the government said
yesterday, Robert Peston writes.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, is expected to announce next week the
results of the Treasury's review of how the banks have been treating their
small business customers, following widespread complaints about insensitive
treatment and overcharging.
He will say the inquiry found that the banks have on the whole been passing
on the benefits of lower base interest rates to small business borrowers,
although there is evidence of sharp rises in business tariffs.
Mr Lamont is also likely to extend the scope of the banking ombudsman scheme
so that complaints of malpractice from incorporated small businesses can be
considered by Mr Laurence Shurman, the official ombudsman. Unincorporated
businesses can already take complaints to him.
The bulk of business complaints relate not to mistakes by banks, however,
but to the terms and conditions imposed by banks for loans and other
services. The Treasury is considering asking the banks to appoint internal
ombudsmen, to deal with these complaints.

<TEXT>
THE ONE cloud on President Bill Clinton's sunny inaugural week grew a little
larger yesterday as his nominee for attorney general, Ms Zoe Baird, faced
tough questioning from senators concerned she had broken the law in
employing illegal aliens for her household.
Ms Baird repeated that she would not withdraw her nomination and said that
awareness of her own transgression would make her even more determined to
ensure that justice be dispensed equally. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the new White
House press secretary, said Mr Clinton stood by her and expected her to be
confirmed.
Senator Orrin Hatch, of Utah, the ranking Republican on the judiciary
committee, yesterday reiterated his support. So far only one member of the
committee, Senator Larry Pressler, the Republican from South Dakota, has
declared he will vote against confirmation. Another Republican, Senator
Nancy Kassebaum from Kansas, not on the committee, also said she would vote
against.
Mr Hatch said his constituent mail was running heavily against Ms Baird and
yesterday she acquired another influential opponent in the person of Ms
Barbara Jordan, the black Texas University law professor known for her high
principles.

FT  22 JAN 93 / New tax boosts Brazilian reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government has won a partial victory in its battle to
implement fiscal reform, with Congressional approval of a new tax on
financial transactions.
After much negotiation, the House of Representatives voted by 358:84 late on
Wednesday to introduce the 0.25 per cent tax on all financial transactions,
including cheques. The government estimates this will generate Dollars 7.2bn
in extra revenue and tap into the informal economy, though Brazil's bankers
are working to find a way round it.
Mr Henrique Hargreaves, the president's chief of staff, said: 'This means we
can now progress with our programme of economic stabilisation and social
investment'.
Economy ministry officials said yesterday they were confident that the new
tax, with a recently approved withholding tax on financial gains, will
enable them to plug the Dollars 13bn hole in this year's budget and show
some progress to the International Monetary Fund at negotiations next month.
The real deficit is thought to be much greater than shown by government
figures, and the reform so far consists of increasing taxes rather than
sweeping structural changes, but the new tax is regarded as a crucial step
on the road to reducing inflation, predicted at 27.5 per cent this month.
Approval of the new tax was won through centre-left co-operation. In return,
the government had to drop two proposed new taxes on fuel and corporate
assets, and to abandon proposed authorisation for the economy ministry to
lift banking secrecy and to set up special tribunals to crack down on
evaders.
It also had to agree to devote more of the new revenue to social programmes.
The new tax requires another House vote, a Senate vote and an enabling act
for implementation this year.

SEMATECH, the US semiconductor consortium backed by government and industry,

process equipment.
US semiconductor production equipment makers have increased their share of
the world market from a low of 43.9 per cent in 1990 to an estimated 53.4
per cent in 1992, according to VLSI Research, a US market research firm.
Sematech's 10 member companies as well as other US chip makers will have
access to the consortium's technology.
Sematech has produced demonstration chips with feature sizes of just 0.35
microns. Such chips contain electronic devices so small that 72,500 of them
in a row would measure just one inch long. The most advanced chips currently
in production have feature sizes of about 0.6 microns.
'By achieving this technology with all-US tools, we have enhanced America's
ability to compete in world markets - with exciting prospects for increased
US market share. . . ,' said Mr Bill George, the consortium's chief
operating officer.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Tyson warns on family poverty
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were signs of an erosion of US competitiveness that had 'potentially
devastating' consequences for ordinary American families, Ms Laura D'Andrea
Tyson, President Bill Clinton's choice for the chair of the Council of
Economic Advisers, told a Senate confirmation hearing yesterday.
Per capita GDP had grown more slowly in the US in recent years than in any
other advanced economy. The US had also suffered 'a decade of worsening
inequality.
'Since 1980, the proportion of full-time workers with annual incomes below
the poverty rate for a family of four had increased from 12 per cent to
nearly 20 per cent.'
Ms Tyson's emphasis on weaknesses in US economic performance contrasted
sharply with up-beat remarks last week by her predecessor, Mr Michael
Boskin, chief economist in the Bush administration. In his final report, he
sought to demolish claims that the US was declining economically, relative
to other industrial nations.
Ms Tyson said she expected the CEA to be 'an integral part of President
Clinton's economic team'. She responded vigorously to criticism of her
nomination from some prominent US economists.

FT  22 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Former Soviet republics try to avert trade
collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MINSK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SPECIAL bank to save trade from collapsing among former Soviet republics
is the most pressing item on the agenda of today's CIS summit, but it is
feared the plan will falter for lack of Russian support.
The proposed Inter-State Bank would act as a multilateral clearing house for
inter-republican trade, with sanctions for republics which exceed agreed
levels of indebtedness. It also provides for co-ordinated monetary, credit,
and budgetary policy as an additional option for those republics which
decide to keep the rouble as their currency. The government of Russia, which
has a trade surplus with virtually every republic, has undertaken to provide
Rbs200bn to finance the bank.
However, Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, central bank governor in Belarus, the
republic hosting the summit, said he feared Russia would 'drag out the
issue' because of disagreements between the Russian central bank and the
government, and a reluctance to bankroll republics which 'will all owe it
money'.
The dilemma of Belarus, provides a stark illustration of what is at stake in
a continuing collapse of trade between republics whose economies remain
highly interdependent. One of the main problems has been the demise of a
common currency as republics have either introduced their own currencies or
continued to use the rouble without co-ordinating monetary and credit
policy.
By unilaterally switching trade to a 'bilateral clearing basis' to prevent
republics from issuing roubles unbacked by goods, Moscow has made it
impossible for Belarus and others to pay for Russian energy imports with
anything other than roubles earned from exports to Russian enterprises.
More than 80 per cent of Belarussian industrial output has traditionally
been exported to other republics. Unlike, for example, Kazakhstan, which can
export raw materials further afield for its currency, Belarus is 100 per
cent dependent on cheap Russian energy supplies to run the manufacturing
industry which is its main source of revenue. Even if a clearing system were
established, it would still be unable to afford world prices for energy
imports.
This is why Belarussian leaders firmly believe the country's future depends
on close co-operation with Russia. 'If Belarus were to pay world prices for
energy it would cost it 2.5 times its hard currency export earnings,' agrees
a diplomat at one of the newly-established foreign embassies which are the
most tangible signs of the republic's reluctantly acquired independence.
A central problem is that unlike Belarus, most republics do not want to
trade some of their newly-won sovereignty - ceding some control over
monetary and credit policy to Russia in order to maintain the rouble as a
common currency. Attempts over the past couple of years to establish a
central banking union to co-ordinate monetary policy has faltered because of
most republics' insistence on one vote per republic. This scheme has been
rejected by Russia which wants voting in a common banking system to be
proportional to each republic's economic clout.
The uncertainty has also provided Belarus with an excuse to freeze
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a reform programme to
stabilise the country's finances and begin restructuring the economy. In the
absence of reforms, production has fallen just 10 per cent instead of 25 per
cent in Russia, and inexplicably its budget deficit has been smaller at just
5 per cent of gross domestic product last year. But inflation remains high
at more than 1,000 per cent last year and the republic adopted a law on
privatisation only three days ago.
'The IMF has given us an ultimatum: either we find an agreement with Russia
or we get out (of the rouble zone) and introduce our own currency. After
this, they are ready to provide us with financial support,' says Mr
Bogdankevich. 'We are not ready to decide either way yet: we are making a
final attempt to come to an arrangement with Russia.'
One solution would be for the west to provide finance for an inter-state
bank, just like the US financed a settlement system in post-war Europe. But
such a proposal, backed for instance by Mr George Soros, the Hungarian-born
philanthropist, is unlikely to make much headway until republics decide
among themselves whether to give up the illusion of a common currency, or to
make it a reality.

FT  22 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Untried hands reach for global levers -
David Dodwell assesses trade talks as time for agreement runs short
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT for the first time in the past six years, the plight of the Uruguay
Round of talks on world trade liberalisation lies in inexperienced hands.
Different this time, however, are the sheer number of untried hands - chief
trade negotiators for both the European Community and the US have come into
office within the past three weeks - and the very limited time for them to
learn the ropes.
Critical decisions which might grasp belated success, or damn the Uruguay
Round to inconclusive and damaging drift, will be made within the next
month. Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), said: 'We are critically short of time. We must
conclude now, or risk drifting into the sands.'
Officials in Geneva, who have overseen the past three months of progress
towards an agreement that could add Dollars 300bn a year to world trade by
the end of the century, were adamant this week that a settlement was within
reach.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's new trade commissioner, appears to agree. He
plans top-level meetings for the next 10 days in Washington, Geneva, and at
the Davos summit, aimed at an agreement. 'Every week we don't have an
agreement costs the world dear in money and jobs,' he said early this week.
But it is unclear that the new US administration shares this view - nor is
there confidence in Washington that agreement is within grasp. Part of the
problem is uncertainty over future US trade policies or priorities.
Confusion has been compounded by the fact that Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US
trade representative, was among the last officials appointed by President
Bill Clinton. He remains in learning mode.
None of Mr Kantor's deputies has yet been chosen, nor is it clear whether
his authority will be unchallenged as 'Mr Trade'. Other senior members of
the Clinton administration have indicated a close interest in trade policy.
Lobbyists point out that Mrs Carla Hills, Mr Kantor's predecessor, took two
years to stamp her authority on the brief.
There is doubt over the priority being given by Mr Clinton to trade policy.
He is strongly committed to put domestic political and economic issues
first. It is uncertain what space there will be for the Uruguay Round in his
programme for the first 100 days - particularly in that politicians and
lobbyists abound in Washington who say the Bush administration had made
unacceptable concessions, which should neither be endorsed nor extended.
Even if trade attracts attention, completion of the North American Free
Trade Agreement may take precedence, along with bilateral US trade relations
with China and Japan, and sectoral issues such as trade in steel, motor
vehicles, and timber.
According to Mr Gary Hufbauer, at the Institute for International Economics
in Washington, the critical question is: 'Will Mr Clinton allow the Uruguay
Round to atrophy on his watch without one last try?' He argues that doing
nothing 'is a decision in its own right - a strong decision for drift', and
he predicts that there is very little time for the administration to pause.
The president's 'fast-track' authority to present a take-it-or-leave-it
trade package to Congress expires in March.
Whether or not Mr Clinton opts for 'one last try' may depend on briefings
from leading Bush trade negotiators such as Mr Jules Katz, Mr Warren Lavorel
and Mr Rufus Yerxa, all temporarily in place until Mr Kantor's deputies have
been chosen.
Officials in Geneva remain convinced a success is possible. They say the
settlement in December of the EC-US dispute over reform of farm trade, and
progress made in the past six weeks on trade in services, and in tariff cuts
on manufactured exports, have greatly reduced outstanding disputes.
'Countries clearly have the flexibility to do the deal, but they won't show
their hands until they are certain we are playing the true end-game,' one
senior Gatt official said. 'Then the trade-offs will fall into place
simultaneously.'
This is not to ignore that these last trade-offs involve pain and
controversy. For the EC, binding open its audio-visual market, and
commitment to reform of national telecommunications monopolies, will arouse
fierce opposition, particularly in France. So will cuts in tariffs around
the ailing electronics industry, and in non-ferrous metals, pulp and paper,
and chemicals.
For the US, a hard decision will be to offer deep cuts in the tariff
protection given to the textiles industry, and to accept restraints on the
use of unilateral sanctions against 'unfair' trade. It will need to back
away from demands to re-open negotiations on anti-dumping rules.
Most critical of all, Mr Clinton will need to resist pressure to introduce
new issues - such as labour and environmental laws - since this would almost
certainly lead to an avalanche of demands from other countries to reopen
areas of concern to them. As a senior trade negotiator from Latin America
pleaded: 'Let's finish what we set out to do in Punta del Este six years
ago. We know there are other items of business that have emerged since then,
but let's tackle those after.'

FT  22 JAN 93 / Clinton basks in warm praise: Real enthusiasm for the
inauguration, the speech, poetry and even the sax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS only one unanswered question early on Wednesday evening. Would
Bill Clinton play his sax at an inaugural ball? Bryant Gumbel, the host of
NBC's Today programme, half hoped he would not, but he was pretty much
alone.
The 42nd President of the United States disappointed only Mr Gumbel. He
played it at the Arkansas Ball, at the MTV rock n'roll ball, and perhaps at
others because he went to 11 of them and got to bed well after two in the
morning. He played Yo' Mama Don't Dance and other classics and if he was
once a bit off-key, he mostly made his horn wail like there was no tomorrow.
But it was not only for his music that Mr Clinton got good reviews
yesterday. After a difficult last two weeks of the transition into office he
was able to bask in some pretty warm compliments about his own performance
on his inauguration day and the clear messages he had imparted about the
direction of his presidency.
Mr Hendrik Hertzberg, editor of the New Yorker magazine, commented that he
seemed 'at ease' as president. Mr William Safire, the acerbic and generally
conservative New York Times columnist, gave his address a B-plus grade, with
good marks for its theme, its use of the seasons as a metaphor, its
historical resonance and its brevity.
From its right-wing editorial pulpit the Wall Street Journal was impressed
that Mr Clinton had made so much of the importance of both civic and
personal responsibility. The more liberal Washington Post concurred.
Even the New York Times, withering in its condemnation of some of Mr
Clinton's cabinet choices and still yesterday suspicious of his
self-righteousness, headlined its first leader A Dawn Of Promise, and
strongly approved his condemnation of Washington as 'a place of intrigue and
calculation.'
The fact that Mr Clinton spoke for only 14 minutes, shorter than all
inaugural addresses except Washington's and Lincoln's, indicated, in the
opinion of just about every pundit, a welcome discipline in a man previously
inclined to rattle on forever.
The deans of television commentary mostly liked it. Mr John Chancellor, the
soon-to-retire NBC veteran, called it 'a fine address and blessedly short',
while Mr David Brinkley of ABC thought it was 'effective'. Mr Dan Rather,
the often agitated CBS anchorman, huffed that 'it didn't have a lot of
poetry'.
There were conflicting views as to its best line, though the one most often
advanced was the sentence: 'There is nothing wrong with America that cannot
be cured by what is right with America.'
Mr Mark Shields, a Democratic consultant and commentator, noted with
satisfaction that Mr Clinton had eschewed bureaucratese in his speech. There
was no mention of 'entrepreneurial capitalism' or 'infrastructure', terms
with normally spill out of Mr Clinton's mouth with abandon.
Mr David Gergen, the notionally conservative foil to Mr Shields on one of
the TV news programmes, was struck by the consistency between Mr Clinton's
address and his campaign themes. Admittedly, Mr Clinton did not talk much of
'sacrifice' last year, as he did on Wednesday, but he was otherwise true to
the arguments that helped make him president.
Typical of this was his call to the young to engage in community service, a
Kennedyesque theme if ever there was one. Mr David Broder, of the Washington
Post, agreed that it was time that 'the biggest and in some respects the
most coddled generation in American history' take control.
There was also an inclination to forgive the apparent slowness in forming a
new administration. Mr R W Apple wrote in the New York Times that such
problems 'may prove to be transitory, the product of inexperience'.
The Washington Post generously re-ran some of its old stories at similar
stages in the Carter, Reagan and Bush administrations, all critical of their
dilatoriness.
There is, of course, a secular bipartisanship to every inauguration day
which allows temporary suspension of many critical faculties. This did not
quite extend to the poetic community, which was divided on the merits of
Maya Angelou's poem, On The Pulse Of Morning, composed at Mr Clinton's
request for the occasion.
However, this was a nearly novel occasion for poets, unaccustomed to the
inaugural limelight since JFK similarly commissioned Robert Frost 32 years
ago.
But even the most hardened cynic could not deny that the inauguration was
greeted with much spontaneous enthusiasm by huge crowds and that Mr Clinton
himself seemed right for the occasion.
That extended to his being the first president to blow the sax on his great
day.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Baird under fire at Senate hearings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONE cloud on President Bill Clinton's sunny inaugural week grew a little
larger yesterday as his nominee for attorney general, Ms Zoe Baird, faced
tough questioning from senators concerned that she had broken the law in
employing illegal aliens for her household.
Ms Baird repeated that she would not withdraw her nomination and said that
awareness of her own transgression would make her even more determined to
ensure that justice be dispensed equally. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the new White
House press secretary, said Mr Clinton stood by her and expected her to be
confirmed.
Senator Orrin Hatch, of Utah, the ranking Republican on the judiciary
committee, yesterday reiterated his support. So far only one member of the
committee, Senator Larry Pressler, the Republican from South Dakota, has
declared he will vote against confirmation.
But Mr Hatch also reported that his constituent mail was running heavily
against Ms Baird and yesterday she acquired another influential opponent in
the person of Ms Barbara Jordan, the black Texas University law professor
known for her high principles.
'The ethical high ground for Zoe Baird is to request that her name be
withdrawn,' Ms Jordan said. Earlier this week, Ms Patricia King, also black
and a Georgetown University law professor, had maintained in a powerful
Washington Post column that the nation's chief law enforcement officer could
not be someone who had recently broken the law.
Elsewhere, the new administration, if not the president himself, began to
get down to work. Mr Clinton was preoccupied with welcoming 2,500 guests to
a White House open day. But Mr Warren Christopher, confirmed on Wednesday as
secretary of state, talked to Mr Nelson Mandela of the African National
Congress.

FT  22 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Air France in Euro Disney deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, the theme park east of Paris, said yesterday that it had
appointed Air France its sole official airline and would not be renewing
contracts with British Airways, Aer Lingus, Lufthansa and Alitalia, Michael
Skapinker reports.
Euro Disney said that after a year of operation it had decided to abandon
its practice of having a preferred airline in each of its main European
markets. It said it wanted Air France to represent it throughout Europe.
Earlier this month Euro Disney had announced that Mr Robert Fitzpatrick was
resigning as chairman to make way for Mr Philippe Bourguignon, a Frenchman.
The four airlines whose contracts are not being renewed were 'preferred
travel partners', which meant that they were permitted to use Euro Disney
promotional material and logos in their advertising.
Euro Disney said its decision to drop British Airways was not related to
controversy surrounding the UK carrier's 'dirty tricks' campaign against
Virgin Atlantic.
Air France will become Euro Disney's preferred carrier immediately
throughout Europe, except for the UK, Ireland, Germany and Italy, where it
will assume the role from the beginning of April.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Beatrice foods chief dies aged 50

<TEXT>
MR REGINALD LEWIS, who died on Wednesday of a cerebral haemorrhage aged 50,
was one of America's richest men, and its most prominent black businessman,
writes Laurie Morse in New York.
The majority owner and chief executive of TLC Beatrice International
Holdings, he was a resident of Manhattan and Paris, and a 1968 graduate of
Harvard Law School.
Mr Lewis acquired Beatrice for Dollars 1bn in 1987, via a remarkable
buy-out, after a career as a corporate lawyer, financier, and take-over
artist. Since then, he was an active manager of the company, selling less
profitable operations and concentrating profit centres in Europe.
TLC Beatrice operates food companies in 18 countries, and had 1991 sales of
Dollars 1.54bn and operating income of Dollars 115m. Mr Lewis and his family
had control of 51 per cent of the stock. The remainer is closely held.
The Beatrice buy-out was built on a smaller take-over success. In 1983,
after years of providing legal advice in similar transactions, Mr Lewis
purchased the ailing McCall Pattern Company from Chicago-based Esmark for
Dollars 22.5m in a leveraged buy-out.
He contributed Dollars 1m in personal savings to the deal. Four years later,
he sold the revamped company to the John Crowther Group of Britain for
Dollars 63m, reaping a personal gain of Dollars 50m.
His experience with McCalls and an alliance with Drexel Burnham Lambert led
to the TLC Beatrice deal in 1987.

FT  22 JAN 93 / World Trade News: US takes world lead in chip technology

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEMATECH, the US government and industry backed semiconductor consortium,
has demonstrated world-leading chip production technology using all-American
process equipment.
US semiconductor production equipment makers have increased their share of
the world market from a low of 43.9 percent in 1990 to an estimated 53.4
percent in 1992, according to VLSI Research, a US market research firm.
Sematech's 10 member companies as well as other US semiconductor
manufacturers will now have access to the consortium's technology.
The achievement represents the accomplishment of Sematech's primary goal,
set when the consortium was formed five years ago. 'When Sematech was
created in 1987, we made a commitment to re-establish the US semiconductor
industry at the forefront of world manufacturing,' said Mr Bill George,
chief operating officer for the consortium based in Austin, Texas.
To do that, Sematech has produced demonstration chips with feature sizes of
just 0.35 microns. Such chips contain electronic devices so small that
72,500 of them in a row would measure just one inch long. The most advanced
chips currently in production have feature sizes of about 0.6 microns.
'By achieving this technology with all-US tools, we have enhanced America's
ability to compete in world markets - with exciting prospects for increased
US market share. . . ,' Mr George said.
Chips with 0.35 micron device widths are seen as the foundation for a new
generation of electronics products ranging from talking computers to
pocket-sized personal communicators linked to global networks, desktop
computers as powerful as today's multi-million dollar supercomputers and
intelligent automobiles equipped with chips that monitor and control
everything from fuel mixture to the suspension system.

FT  22 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: German deal lifts ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in ICI appreciated 26 to 1123p as news that the chemical and
pharmaceuticals giant plans to swap plastics businesses with BASF, of
Germany, gave a boost to fund manager enthusiasm.
A number of analysts are broadly cautious about ICI ahead of its proposal to
split its pharmaceuticals and chemicals divisions. However, institutions
have begun to buy the stock for its cyclical attractions. Mr Charles
Lambert, chemicals analyst with Smith New Court who has taken a very bearish
view of the stock, said the exchange would be beneficial and, although the
market had expected ICI to sell its polypropylene business, the swap for
BASF's acrylics arm was an added benefit.
However, he argued that yesterday's share price move was not justified by
the news and that significant doubts remained over the demerger proposals.
'Quite clearly, if they are going to do it within the proposed time scale it
would definitely necessitate a rights issue of Pounds 500m minimum,' he
said.
Under the swap, BASF will get ICI's west European polypropylene business,
while ICI will get BASF's west European production of acrylics - best known
in its use as Perspex.
Bass pleases
Relief at the Bass trading statement sent the shares higher yesterday,
although the market remained firmly divided over the prospects for the
group.
The agm statement was cautious but not as gloomy as many analysts had
predicted. The brewing and leisure group said that, while market conditions
were tough and the outlook in brewing remained uncertain, there were areas
of improvement.
Kleinwort Benson shaved its forecasts and remained a seller, continuing to
argue that 'the outlook is less than rosy in terms of domestic consumer
recovery'. NatWest Securities was more positive, changing from a sell to a
hold on the belief that the recent fall in the shares was overdone.
Meanwhile, BZW believes that, in spite of the sluggish recovery picture,
Bass is well placed in its key businesses to benefit from an early stage,
while other earnings gains this year will come from cost-cutting.
One other leading house was also said to be recommending a switch from
Whitbread into Bass. The latter rose 13 to 595p in turnover of 4.2m.
Whitbread 'A' declined 7 to 445p.
Forte worries
Hotel group Forte weakened as word leaked into the market that one house had
turned bearish after meeting with the hotel group and was forecasting a
dividend cut. Such concerns have hit Forte before, with bears of the stock
already predicting a reduced dividend - NatWest Securities has suggested
Forte may have to reduce from 9.9p to 6.5p. However, so far most other
brokers have kept to a held dividend forecast. The shares fell 5 to 178p in
large turnover of 9m.
Banks strong
Most of the banks were strong performers as they benefited from growing
hopes that interest rates would be cut shortly. The market also decided
that, having weathered the worst of the recession, they are well positioned
for recovery compared with their European rivals.
Barclays rose 15 to 412p and National Westminster, in spite of
recommendations to switch out of the stock, improved 11 to 426p. Old bid
candidate Royal Bank of Scotland gained 8 at 222p and Abbey National
shrugged off a recent negative note from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew to add 8 1/2 at
360p. The rise and rise of HSBC continued, the ordinaries climbing 23 to
550p and the Hong Kong registered 22 1/2 to 532p. Turnover was generally
heavy.
Meanwhile, the bid fever that had prompted the sharp rise of Standard
Chartered appeared to die down. The shares were 24 higher at one stage but
were then sold down to close only 6 ahead at 636p.
Brent Walker, 2 1/2 firmer at 13p, and Ladbroke, up 2 at 195p, continued to
benefit from the prospect of longer betting shop hours. Granada was in
demand as talk of a 25 per cent rise in the price paid for each Coronation
Street episode lifted the shares. They closed 11 better at 359p. Euro Disney
added 7 at 780p after announcing a tie-up with Air France.
Better sales but at the expense of lower margins led to weakness in Burton,
which became the latest retail group to present a cautious picture of
recovery. The group said it had yet to detect any convincing signs of
economic revival.
While pre-Christmas sales growth was some 12 per cent ahead, margins
declined by around 2 1/2 per cent. Many analysts reined in their forecasts,
coming down from a Pounds 30m to Pounds 33m range to around Pounds 25m for
this year. The shares later rallied to end a net 1 1/2 off at 71 1/2 p.
Talk of downgrades at Associated British Foods sent the shares tumbling 9 to
485p. Revived suggestions that Dairy Farm might bid for Kwik Save
circulated, the latter rising 12 to 806p.
Regulatory worries were again in evidence in the water stocks, with Credit
Lyonnais Laing suggesting that the effect of official intervention could be
much more costly than at first thought. Among those hardest hit, Anglian
fell 7 to 462p, Thames 7 to 472p and Wessex 6 to 576p.
Food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan put on 15 at 440p as a big buyer
was seen early on, with further interest being prompted by a strong buy note
from Kleinwort Benson. After meeting the company, the house said that with
half GrandMet's profits coming from the US it will be an early beneficiary
of recovery there. The shares' recent underperformance also make them
attractive, it is argued.
British Gas was held down to a gain of only a penny at 287p as the company
announced a Pounds 70m restructuring programme.
Insurer Sun Alliance added 7 at 333p on what one analyst described as
'better end of average' new business figures. Sun's 1992 worldwide new
premium income for life and pension business was up 60 per cent to Pounds
744m from Pounds 475m.
An overnight surge in the pharmaceuticals sector on Wall Street helped to
push up UK drugs shares. Glaxo advanced 15 to 717p and Wellcome 17 to 930p.
Selling of Reuters Holdings continued ahead of the forthcoming figures and
the shares fell 24 to 1330p.
The deal with Taiwan Aerospace announced earlier in the week continued to
boost British Aerospace, which climbed 8 to 210p in heavy trade of 7.3m.
Kleinwort Benson favours the stock. Profit-taking in Rolls-Royce left the
shares 3 down at 116 1/2 p. Volume reached 6.7m.
Bargain hunters lifted Charter Consolidated and Johnson Matthey. Charter
jumped 20 to 689p and the latter gained 9 at 489p. The strong market trend
helped IMI shrug off the recent Smith New Court sell recommendation and
register an improvement of 5 at 257p.
News of the Dollars 300m deal between British Airways and USAir came shortly
after the market close and had no effect on the day's trading. The shares
eased 3 to 265p, having had 5m traded as the market awaited the outcome of
yesterday's board meeting which discussed an internal inquiry into the
'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic.
NFC gave up 3 to 264p amid talk that it would soon announce a disposal to a
US group. An analysts' visit to Ocean Group benefited the shares and they
moved 15 ahead to 283p. A squeeze sent BAA 5 forward to 788p.
Textile group Coats Viyella paused for breath following a rise on the back
of an in-depth BZW buy note. The shares were steady at 214p as the house's
textiles analysts travelled to Scotland to speak to institutions.
Consumer credit group First National Finance Corporation firmed 5 to 76p as
one institution bought a line of stock.
Interior decoration group Colefax &amp; Fowler weakened 5 to 33p on recording a
six-month loss of Pounds 192,000.
Advertising agency More O'Ferrall moved forward 10 to 210p as investors
bought for the dividend ahead of figures expected in March.

FT  22 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLUTCH of poor economic data led to hopes of a cut in interest rates which
drove stock index futures sharply forward, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,764, the March contract on the FT-SE was sold down to
2,753 within the first half-an-hour of the opening. However, bargain hunting
helped the contract recover and it was trading at 2,765 by 11.30am when the
economic statistics, particularly the poor jobless figures, led to
speculation that the UK government would soon be forced to reduce interest
rates.
The talk led to greater momentum for March as the gilts and short sterling
also put in a good performance and the day's high of 2,790 was reached just
before the close.
March finished at 2,788, up 29 from the previous session and about 6 points
ahead of its fair value premium to cash of around 8. Volume was 8,482 lots.
Dealers said March continued to move forward in after-hours' trading.
Turnover in traded options improved for a second day, reaching 34,917 lots.
Around a third of the total was composed of trades in index options, with
11,880 contracts recorded in the FT-SE 100 option and 965 lots in the Euro
FT-SE 100 Index option.
British Airways was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,652 lots
dealt and was followed by Ladbrokes with 2,078 contracts. Hillsdown, British
Aerospace and Asda were also active.

BAD NEWS on the real economy proved no hindrance to stock market optimists
yesterday, who quickly switched direction towards confidence that the UK
government will be forced to cut domestic interest rates much sooner than
expected. Share prices brushed off early uncertainty to advance by 24 points
on the FT-SE 100 scale, ignoring late weakness in sterling which was seen as
a move before a possible cut in UK rates.
The turning point in a sluggish market came after disclosure of a
significantly greater jump in UK December unemployment than expected and a
similarly disappointing fall in manufacturing output in November. The
absence of any move in German rates following yesterday's meeting at the
Bundesbank was soon forgotten in London.
All the investment hopes based on belief that the UK was recovering from
recession, a view already disturbed by this week's news of poor Christmas
retail sales, were hurriedly replaced by arguments that the economy was now
so bad that the government would be forced to deliver another rate reduction
immediately.
'Instead of one large cut in base rates at Budget time, the market now
expects two half-point cuts soon - the first, perhaps, in early February,'
commented Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull.
The Footsie advanced strongly in the second half of the session, and trading
volume also increased. At the final reading, the FT-SE Index was 24.6 ahead
at 2,773.3, effectively the best level of the day. Seaq-reported volume
jumped to 701.3m shares from Wednesday's 599.4m; retail business remained
high on Wednesday, with a worth of Pounds 1.33bn comparing favourably with
the daily averages of the past three months.
London largely ignored international factors yesterday, including the latest
allied raid against Iraq and Wall Street's sluggish performance on the first
full day of the Clinton presidency; the Dow Industrial Average was barely
changed from overnight in London trading hours.
The sudden reversal to more wide-ranging domestic factors in the London
stock market was reflected in a sharper rise in the FT-SE Index stocks than
in the second-liners; the FT-SE Mid 250 Index added only 9.3 points
yesterday.
Some analysts suggested that yesterday's relatively firm trend in the stock
market against a generally weak economic background underlined optimism for
a recovery in the UK economy later in the year. Strategists believe that any
rate move might come in the middle of next week, when a suitable opening in
the bond funding timetable will appear.
Technical factors were also helpful, if perhaps only in the short term.
Fears of a large rights issue, specifically from the pharmaceuticals sector,
continued to recede, although many analysts warned that pressures from both
equity and bond funding were likely to persist this year.
At least one very large trading programme moved through the stock market at
mid-session and investment confidence was also encouraged by a handful of
corporate deals. Shares in ICI, still unsettled as the market awaits news on
the planned demerger of the bio-science divisions, advanced on a two-way
deal with BASF, the German chemicals group.

FT  22 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Secondary issues set peak as
Dow firms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
Although blue chip issues mainly continued to drift in directionless trading
yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended modestly firmer, while
secondary stocks advanced to set a new high, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow blue chip indicator was up 11.07 at 3,253.02, near its
high for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained
2.12 at 435.49, while the Nasdaq composite was 3.33 higher at 700.77,
another record close for the index. Trading volume on the New York SE
amounted to 257.6m shares.
The markets are currently trapped in a pattern of narrow gains, punctuated
by the occasional sell-off, reflecting that investors are searching for an
external lead, but finding nothing. Corporate earnings in the latest
quarterly reporting season have been inconclusive, neither sufficiently
positive or negative to affect sentiment.
As for the economic background, conditions continue to improve, but at a
disappointingly slow pace. The 'Beige Book' report yesterday found that
retail sales were 'significantly better' over the Christmas holiday season,
a general improvement in manufacturing, more strength in the residential
housing market, and increased loan demand.
The Federal Reserve said, however, that the upturn in various industrial
sectors has not sparked an improvement in the depressed labour markets.
McDonnell Douglas rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 56 1/2 in spite of a 42 per
cent decline in income from continuing operations during the final quarter
of 1992. Investors, however, were cheered by a statement from McDonnell that
said, but for its C17 military aircraft programme, the government aerospace
programmes had their best year in the company's history. McDonnell was also
optimistic about the outlook for 1993, including the C17 programme.
Tandem Computers was the most active stock, falling Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars
14 1/8 in volume of 8.2m shares after disappointing the market with fiscal
first-quarter net income of Dollars 17.5m, or 16 cents a share.
Bank shares were in mixed form following recent results which showed an
improvement in sector earnings. Wells Fargo remained in strong demand,
rising Dollars 1 to Dollars 98 1/4 .
Bear Stearns eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 17 3/8 on news that fiscal
second-quarter earnings at the broking firm fell 17 per cent to Dollars
64.3m, primarily as the result of lower investment banking and principal
trading revenues.
On the Nasdaq market, the composite index was lifted by a strong performance
from its leading stock, Microsoft, which advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
89 1/2 as 2.3m shares changed hands.
Canada
A FALLING Canadian dollar and bond market sent stocks lower in active
trading. The TSE 300 index receded 15.1 to 3,275.1, while declining issues
outpaced rises by 358 to 248 after volume of 41.7m shares.
The banks index slipped 0.9 per cent. An analyst said investors' confidence
in the Canadian banks' earnings potential is slipping. News that Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce has made two issues of preferred shares weighed
heavily on the sector and CIBC slid CDollars 7/8 to CDollars 24.

FT  22 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Taiwan cautiously greets the Year of
the Cockerel - Simon Davies reviews prospects for the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Year of the Cockerel is being greeted by many in Taiwan as the year
which will see the stock market finally rebound from its 73 per cent slide
over the past two years. But there are growing signs that it will open with
further falls.
The government has finally made it clear that it is keen to support share
prices and it has proposed long-awaited concessions, such as halving the
stock transaction tax and easing restrictions for foreign institutional
investors.
As a result of these measures - which have yet to be approved - the Taiwan
Stock Exchange index rallied 8 per cent to 3,420.62 in the last seven
trading days before the Chinese New Year holiday.
In a market which has historically shown little interest in fundamentals,
there are brokers who suggest that the 0.3 percentage-point tax reduction
could be the sign local investors are looking for to return.
The economy is still seeing reasonable growth of around 6 per cent a year
and company earnings are expected to recover in 1993 after declining in
1992. However, the market still looks fundamentally expensive by comparison
to others in the region. HG Asia Securities in London expects company
earnings in 1993 of 8.5 per cent, putting the market on a price-earnings
ratio of 21.8 times. This compares with a p/e of 9.4 in Hong Kong and 13.7
in Thailand.
Politics will remain a focus of attention when trading resumes next week.
February will bring to an end the sensitive debate over who will replace
Premier Hau Pei-tsun - one of the last key members of the mainland-born old
guard - following President Lee Teng-hui's unconvincing victory in
December's legislative elections. 'This market gets upset by political
instability, because it is not used to it,' says Mr Peter Kurz, senior
representative of Baring Securities Taiwan. He predicts that the weighted
index will fall below 3,000 during 1993.
The political news is not entirely negative. President Lee's mainstream
faction of the ruling Kuomintang party encountered a substantial protest
vote in the recent elections, but it still controls sufficient power in the
legislature to suggest that there will be no significant change in its
market-oriented policy.
Fundamental restraints remain. The government is projected to raise TDollars
100bn (USDollars 4bn)from privatisations this year, while brokers pre-dict a
further TDollars 60bn from private sector capital raising.
This could create a substantial drain on liquidity, although the government
plans may prove over-ambitious, after the TDollars 2.8bn China Airlines
public offer was only 11 per cent subscribed.
More competition for liquidity will come from 15 new banks that opened last
year and which are keen to expand their deposit base. Also, the level of
Taiwanese investment into mainland China is showing no signs of abating:
provisional estimates suggest Dollars 3.5bn was invested last year.
Counteracting this liquidity drain will be the capital invested by 11
proposed investment trusts, each of which has 45 days to raise TDollars 4bn.
The first companies started fund raising shortly before the Chinese New Year
and this should provide some support for blue chip companies.
Overall, the Year of the Cockerel appears unlikely to bring initial joy to
Taiwanese stock speculators. However, there are some attractive sectors
within this gloomy picture, such as electronics companies.
Brokers still hold out the distant hope that the prohibition on direct air
and sea links, and investment, with the mainland will soon be lifted,
allowing Taiwanese companies to gain the full benefits from China's
expanding economy.
Mr Graham Ormerod of head of research at Jardine Fleming Taiwan Securities,
says: 'It is a risky market, but with high risks come potentially high
rewards.'

FT  22 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses mixed after Bundesbank
meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our markets staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE continent saw individual features predominating yesterday, writes our
markets staff.
FRANKFURT eased while the decision by the Bundesbank not to lower interest
rates came as no surprise. The DAX index closed 1.21 lower at 1,573.67 after
a day's high of 1,582.73. Turnover fell to DM5.2bn from DM6.2bn.
Attention turns today to January inflation data which is expected to show an
increase over the previous month, partly as a result of the increase in
value added tax at the start of the year.
While there was little corporate news to stimulate interest the banking
sector was active after reports of downgrades. Lehman Brothers in London
said in a note released earlier this week that 'the speed of the economic
slowdown in the German economy makes us more cautious towards the banking
sector as a whole' and has revised downwards its earnings estimates for 1992
and 1993 to reflect increased bad debt projections.
Deutsche Bank lost DM6.50 to DM645, Dresdner Bank fell DM3 to DM352 while
Commerzbank went against the trend with a rise of DM3.10 to DM251.60.
PARIS continued to feature Lyonnaise-Dumez after the group forecast sharply
lower 1992 net profit on Wednesday. The shares fell to a 12-month low of
FFr392 before recovering to close down FFr25.50 or 5.8 per cent at
FFr410.00. Suez, which has a shareholding in the group, declined FFr2.50 to
FFr269.50, while Generale des Eaux slipped FFr36 to FFr2,056.
The CAC-40 index closed 6.64 down at 1,812.18 in turnover of some FFr3.3bn.
St Gobain lost FFr8 to FFr481 ahead of announcing a fall in 1992 earnings
per share from 1991 after the close.
MILAN closed firmer but off session highs as an initial flurry of buying
gave way to profit-taking before bargain hunters returned. The Comit index
finished 2.26 higher at 487.6.
Interest by long-term investors in Generali was attributed to the planned
introduction of pension funds in Italy and expectations that more people
would rely on life insurance as the government squeezes benefits. Generali
fixed L780 higher at L33,210, but retreated to L33,000 in after-hours
trading.
Shares in Cementir, the former state cement group, which was sold to the
Caltagirone group of companies last year, surged in illiquid trading and the
fixing was delayed to the end of floor dealings. The stock fixed L115 higher
at L1,645 and rose to L1,680 after-hours.
ZURICH ended just off the day's high on selective buying in blue-chips. The
SMI index rose 24.7 to 2,087.4.
Sandoz bearers, which fell SFr110 on Wednesday, picked up SFr30 to SFr3,060
as it said it expected profits for 1992 to be substantially higher than the
previous year. However, an 8 per cent increase in sales last year was at the
lower end of some analysts' expectations.
The banking and insurance sectors remained strong following a slight
decrease in some short-term interest rates. CS Holding bearers, benefitting
in part from a large buy order, added SFr50 to SFr2,110 and Union Bank
bearers put on SFr8 to SFr896.
BRUSSELS was lifted by strong performances from Solvay and Petrofina and the
BEl-20 index closed 13.67 higher at 1,164.41 in high turnover of some
BFr2bn.
Solvay advanced BFr625 or 5.3 per cent to BFr12,425 while Petrofina closed
up BFr310 or 4.2 per cent at BFr7,620, off the day's high of BFr7,730,
helped by news after Wednesday's close that it had sold its minority stake
in Tractebel, up BFr90 at BFr8,220. Delhaize improved BFr36 or 2.8 per cent
to BFr1,334 on a broker's upgrade.
AMSTERDAM rose as investors absorbed news of plans by Bols and Wessanen to
merge. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.3 up at 99.2. Bols shed 90 cents to
Fl 46.10 while Wessanen lost 20 cents to Fl 98.30.
Wolters Kluwer rose Fl 1.60 to Fl 88.90.
STOCKHOLM saw Astra weaken after local newspaper reports suggested that the
cost of implementing its co-operation agreement with Merck of the US could
be higher than anticipated because of the appreciation in the US dollar. Its
B shares lost SKr6 to SKr689. The Affarsvarlden index fell 5.9 to 927.2.

FT  22 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Public fund buying lifts
Nikkei in final hour
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING BY public fund managers during the final hour of trading left the
Nikkei average firmer, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.  The 225-issue
average gained 28.50 at 16,538.68 after moving between 16,374.13 and
16,585.53. Arbitrage selling and profit-taking by foreign investors pushed
the index into negative territory for most of the day, but prices finally
found support from public buying and arbitrage purchases towards the end of
the session.
Volume was almost unchanged, at 200m shares against 210m, and declines
finally led rises by 572 to 307, with 210 issues unchanged. The Topix index
of all first section stocks lost 1.42 to 1,264.66 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.35 to 1,034.38.
Overall trading remained weak, with most investors focusing on reports of
corporate mergers and acquisitions. Confirmed reports that Nippon Steel was
in talks with Minebea, the ball bearings company, over a transfer of NMB
Semiconductor, Minebea's semiconductor affiliate, prompted the Japan
Securities Dealers Association to suspend trading of NMB on the
over-the-counter market.
The association also announced an investigation into possible insider
trading of NMB shares after the stock rose to Y958,000 on Wednesday, more
than double the traded price in December. Trading volume has surged by more
than 40 times since late December. Minebea, the second most active stock on
the first section, put on Y3 at Y471, while Nippon Steel edged forward Y1 to
Y286.
Meanwhile, reports that Ito-Yokado, a supermarket chain, was buying a 29 per
cent stake in Isetan, a leading department store, from Shuwa, the ailing
stock and property speculator, prompted volatility among retail sector
issues. Isetan plunged Y400 to Y1,980, while Ito-Yokado, which later said
talks to acquire the stake had fallen through, retreated Y150 to Y3,500.
Reports that Matsuzakaya, another department stock held by Shuwa, would be
sold next month unnerved investors. Shuwa held stakes in six retailers
during the late 1980s but is currently seeing increasing pressure to raise
funds to repay its mounting debts. Matsuzakaya dropped by its daily limit of
Y200 to Y1,020.
Oki Electric was the largest percentage gainer of the day, climbing Y33 to
Y365. It is seen as a leading 'restructuring' theme stock, along with Isuzu
Motors, which was the day's most active issue, appreciating Y12 to Y360.
On the Tokyo SE foreign section, Royal Bank of Canada decided to delist its
stock, following five foreign companies that included General Motors, which
delisted at the end of last year.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 91.02 to 18,011.77 in volume of 34m
shares.
Roundup
SOME Pacific Rim markets moved ahead as a holiday mood took hold.
HONG KONG advanced on selective bargain hunting before the market closed for
the Lunar New Year holiday.
The Hang Seng index finished the shortened week 37.37, or 0.64 per cent,
ahead on the day at 5,914.39, having touched 5,936.15 at one stage after
reversing early losses.
Turnover stayed slim, at HKDollars 2.34bn against Wednesday's HKDollars
2.48bn, with many local fund managers already on holidays.
Swire Pacific 'A' rose HKDollars 1.20 to HKDollars 31 as talks resumed to
end the strike at Cathay Pacific, unchanged at HKDollars 9.35.
Property shares were sought amid speculation that the 70 per cent
residential mortgage cap will be lifted to 90 per cent later this year.
SINGAPORE saw foreign demand for blue chip issues which took the Straits
Times Industrial index 15.71 higher to 1,593.87 in volume of 63.9m shares.
Overall, however, declining issues outnumbered gainers by 111 to 79.
The strong close led to expectations that there could be a push into record
territory during today's half-day session, ahead of the long weekend break.
The current record of 1,607.12 was set in March 1990.
Among blue chips, Cerebos ended 14 cents up at SDollars 4.64 after Suntory
placed 15m shares at SDollars 4.30 overnight.
AUSTRALIA tended lower in thin trading, with a weaker Australian dollar
keeping foreign investors away.
The All Ordinaries index ended 2.7 off at 1,519.1, after having dipped to
1,514.3 at one stage, in volume that totalled ADollars 198.64m.
NAB lost 3 cents to ADollars 7.52 in spite of predictions at the bank's
annual meeting of improved profits, while ANZ shed 2 cents to ADollars 3.02
and CBA dipped 5 cents to ADollars 5.85.
MANILA climbed in a strong, broadly based rally sparked by the rebound of
telephone giant Philippine Long Distance Telephone by 20 pesos to 880 pesos.
The composite index rose 21.56 to 1,331.24 for a two-day advance of 48.24.
KUALA LUMPUR picked up some early losses to finish mixed, but trading was
restricted.
BANGKOK saw demand for the big property issues, which pushed the SET index
up 4.04 to 965.34, its highest level since November 5.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Bets on rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STERLING cash and futures markets started to bet on a cut in UK base
rates before the March budget, following the release of extremely poor UK
economic indicators yesterday, writes James Blitz.
Both the larger than expected rise of 60,800 in the number of people out of
work in December and the 0.5 per cent fall in manufacturing output in
November persuaded many dealers that the UK government must urgently
contemplate a cut in interest rates to stimulate the economy.
Until yesterday, the market appeared to believe that base rates would not be
cut before the UK chancellor's Budget in March, and that the reduction in
rates might only be in the order of 50 basis points. However, a dealer said
yest-erday: 'The market could not have been given a more dis-astrous set of
figures than these.'
The March sterling contract rose 18 basis points to close at 93.70, a level
which supposes that three-month money at Budget time will be at 6.30 per
cent. This is compatible with a 100 basis-point cut in base rate, which
would immediately bring three-month money down to about 6 1/4 per cent.
One dealer suggested yesterday that anyone buying the March contract from
now on would be betting on an immediate easing in policy.
That did not stop another dealer suggesting that 'March' still has 20 basis
points to climb, because the market is so optimistic. 'I do not think there
actually will be a 1 per cent cut in rates but, in this game, the journey is
more important than where you arrive,' he said.
The cash market now appears to be entering a period when prospects of a rate
cut discourage dealers from tying up funds with the Bank of England through
the offer of bills. Several dealers anticipated tight overnight lending
rates from here to Budget Day.
Three-month sterling cash fell sharply yesterday from around 7 per cent to 6
13/16 per cent. The decline was all the more remarkable considering the
tightness of conditions in the discount market.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.9bn, there was late
assistance of Pounds 350m and the overnight rate peaked at 10 per cent.
The key issue for the UK government now is whether it cares enough about the
sterling exchange rate to avoid lowering base rates.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: New worries about sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING tumbled by more than two pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday
after an extremely gloomy set of indicators raised concern that the UK
economy may be continuing to stagnate, writes James Blitz.
Since the middle of December, currency dealers had believed that the pound
was well underpinned against the German currency and that a return to the
DM2.40 exchange rate seen in October was unlikely. Anecdotal evidence of a
pick-up in shopping over the Christmas period was among the factors
underlining that view.
Yesterday's unemployment figure, which showed a rise of 60,800 in the number
of people out of work in December, and the 0.5 per cent fall in
manufacturing output in November have changed some minds.
Several dealers said yesterday that, in the first quarter of this year,
sterling could revisit the 1992 low of DM2.3690, against the prospect of
more cuts in UK interest rates.
'The currency may enjoy some consolidation in the next couple of weeks
because it has had such a huge fall since the start of the year,' commented
Mr Mark Brett, a currency analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. 'But
there must be a risk that, in the run-up to the Budget, it will break due
south again.'
Mr Ian Harnett, chief economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull in
London, said: 'We are entering a period of great fragility for the pound.
There is now a feeling in the market that UK rates will come down faster
than Germany's, even if the Bundesbank eases policy next month.'
The impact of yesterday's indicators was seen in sterling's fall to
substantially below DM2.50, which some technical analysts see as a
significant support level.
The currency finished at DM2.4525, exactly 2 1/4 pfennigs weaker on the day
and 5 pfennigs down on the week to date. Against the dollar, the pound
closed at Dollars 1.5180, some 2 1/4 cents lower. It picked up to end at
Dollars 1.5225 in New York.
Sterling has seen sharp falls against the D-Mark several times in the last
few months, only to back up above DM2.50 very promptly. But, according to Mr
Brett, the worrying factor about yesterday's UK indicators was that they
showed that 3 percentage points off interest rates and a significant
devaluation had still failed to boost the economy.
He also believes that investors will seek very low levels for the
sterling/D-Mark rate if they are to invest in the estimated Pounds 50bn of
gilts which will meet the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement for 1993/94.
By contrast, the dollar enjoyed some strength against the D-Mark after a
business survey from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed an acceleration
in manufacturing growth in January.
The US currency ended nearly a pfennig higher at DM1.6150. Against the yen
it firmed to Y125. In New York the dollar closed at DM1.6140.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tungsten mine closes as market
demand collapses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VIRTUAL collapse in demand has forced the closure of one of Europe's two
remaining tungsten mines while the other is to cut production and employment
by about two-thirds. In 1991 the two mines accounted for about 35 per cent
of tungsten production outside the former eastern bloc.
The Mittersill mine in Austria, previously one of the western world's
biggest producers with an output of about 1,400 tonnes a year, has been put
on a 'care and maintenance' basis this month. Mittersill's operating
company, Wolfram Bergbau, is a subsidiary of Metallgesellschaft of Germany.
Meanwhile, employees at the Panasqueira mine in northern Portugal, have been
told that unless they agree to drastic cuts it would also have to be put on
care and maintenance until tungsten prices improve substantially.
Tungsten is a very dense material and has the highest melting point of any
metal. Its principal uses are in cemented carbides, alloyed steels, super
alloys, electrical and electronic products and armaments.
At the Portuguese mine plans have been made to reduce present annual
production of 1,200 tonnes of tungsten contained in concentrate - about 16
per cent of western world output of the metal - to 450 tonnes while the
workforce would be reduced from 640 to 260.
Minorco, the Luxembourg-quoted investment arm of the Anglo American
Corporation of South Africa, which in October, 1990, paid Pounds 14.9m for
80.55 per cent of the mine's operating company, has told unions represented
at the mine it wants to complete the changes by the end of March.
China dominates world tungsten production and has frequently been accused of
dumping tungsten on western markets.
There are market rumours that Chinese mines are at a standstill because
Russia, previously the biggest consumer of the metal and which imported more
than 5,000 tonnes a year from China, has stopped buying.
The International Tungsten Industry Association estimates that production
outside the former eastern bloc dropped from 7,500 tonnes in 1991 to 6,000
tonnes last year because of recession in many industrialised countries and
falling armaments production. Before the Portuguese cuts were announced, it
was predicting a further fall in output this year to 5,000 tonnes. Mr
Michael Maby, secretary-general of the association, said yesterday: 'On
paper the market looks in balance but any increase in demand can be supplied
by China very cheaply indeed'.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway boosted crude oil
production by 14% in 1992

<TEXT>
NORWAY LAST year boosted crude oil production by 14 per cent and gas
production by 5 per cent, while adding significant reserves which
comfortably exceeded aggregate production, according to a report published
yesterday.
Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie says Norway's oil production attained a
record average level of 2.21m barrels a day over the whole of last year, but
surged above 2.3m b/d during the fourth quarter.
Discoveries and reserve upgrades in 1992 reached 1.3bn barrels of oil
equivalent, which more than replaced aggregate production of 985m barrels,
the report says. Although drilling activity fell 11 per cent to 29 completed
wells, ten new discoveries yielded about 27m barrels of oil equivalent per
well. This represented a success rate of 34 per cent. WoodMac says Statoil,
the Norwegian state oil company, made the most significant discovery, of
about 250m barrels of oil, but Norsk Hydro drilled more wells. Statoil found
the oil in the relatively unexplored Nordland II area of the mid-Norwegian
shelf.
Separately, the analyst believes the most sought after acreage in Norway's
14th licensing round is found in the northern North Sea where some of the
largest oil discoveries off Norway have been made. Applications for the 50
blocks and part blocks on offer have to be submitted by March 1 and
allocation is expected in the third quarter.
'Despite the harsher fiscal terms which were introduced during early 1992,
we expect companies to compete aggressively for the acreage made available,'
WoodMac says.

The London Metal Exchange's three-months LEAD prices fell below a technical
support level yesterday to reach the lowest level for 11 months. As bearish
fundamentals were underlined by a report from the International Lead and
Zinc Study Group (see story above) the price declined Pounds 4 to Pounds
286.25 a tonne - and the fall would have been twice that but for sterling's
weakness against the US dollar. The COPPER market was described by traders
as featureless and Pounds 20 of the three months position's Pounds 25 rise
to Pounds 1,482.25 a tonne was attributable to the currency factor. The TIN
market's cautious rise continued with the three months position closing
Dollars 67.50 higher at Dollars 6,065 a tonne. But the advance was trimmed
in after hours trading, which ended with the price at Dollars 6,030 a tonne.
Precious metals moved high but failed to break through overhead resistance.
GOLD closed 50 cents up at Dollars 330.05 a tonne while PLATINUM was Dollars
3 higher at Dollars 373.50 a tonne. Gold dealers said they had hoped
producers might hold off selling to clear space for gold above Dollars 330
an ounce.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Global coffee prices slip ahead
of London talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLIDE in world coffee prices continued yesterday as producers'
expressions of confidence about next week's London talks on negotiating a
new price-supporting International Coffee Agreement failed to impress
traders.
The March delivery price at the London Futures and Options Exchange's
robusta coffee market dipped to Dollars 877 a tonne at one point before
ending Dollars 26 down on the day at Dollars 884 a tonne. That was down
Dollars 91 from the end of last week and Dollars 198 from the peak reached
less than a month ago. Some traders pointed out, however, that recent falls
 -which reflected heavy investment fund selling in the New York market - had
created an 'oversold' technical situation, and suggested a 'bounce' was due.
Brazil, the biggest coffee producer, told a meeting of producers'
representatives in London yesterday it was ready to consider new ideas on
export control at origin and updating quota allocations. 'There is a lot of
determination on our part to get this agreement at least made viable by the
end of March,' said Mr Marques Porto, head of the Brazilian delegation.
March 31 is the extended deadline for reaching agreement on a new accord,
and that would allow only six months for ratification before the expiry of
the existing pact, which does not operate an export quota system.
'It will be interesting to see if they can maintain minor progress but it
won't really affect the market,' a London dealer told the Reuter news
agency. 'Agreements take a long time to implement.'

FT  22 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts downgrade price
forecasts as lead and zinc exports surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOCKED BY a dramatic surge in exports of lead and zinc from the former
eastern bloc countries, some analysts have been revising downwards their
price forecasts.
Preliminary estimates yesterday from the International Lead and Zinc Study
Group suggested that net imports of lead to the west from the eastern bloc
last year nearly tripled, from 49,000 tonnes in 1991 to 120,000 tonnes.
This pushed the lead market in the west into a supply surplus of about
85,000 tonnes compared with a 6,000-tonne deficit in 1991.
On Wednesday the Study Group's statistics showed a similar situation in the
zinc market - eastern bloc exports more than doubled last year, causing the
supply surplus to rise from 86,000 to 238,000 tonnes. Mr Nick Moore, analyst
at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, said: 'This news is far
worse than even pessimistic observers had forecast'. He said he was
adjusting predictions he made at the end of last year and cutting the
average lead price forecast for this year by 11 per cent to 24 US cents a
lb. His forecast for 1994 is down 9 per cent to 30 cents. Mr Moore's zinc
price forecasts for 1993 and 1994 are cut respectively by 10 per cent and 7
per cent to 54 cents and 65 cents a lb.
The study group said preliminary estimates suggested that mine production of
lead last year was down 1.8 per cent to 2.323m tonnes, and refined metal
output also fell, 0.4 per cent, to 4.4m tonnes. Lead consumption slipped 0.8
per cent to 4.43m tonnes.

MALAYSIA'S COCOA Board has raised its 1992 cocoa output estimate to 200,000
tonnes from 184,000, but some traders said the actual figure could be much
higher, reports Reuter from Tawau.
Traders in the east Malaysian state of Sabah estimated 1992 cocoa supply,
including carry-over stocks, could reach 235,000 tonnes, compared with
230,000 in 1991 and 247,000 in 1990.
'Good rains in the later part of the year and big year-end crop made up the
production figures,' said a senior trader.
Other traders in the Tawau, Sabah's main cocoa-producing region, said some
estates saw a 30 to 40 per cent rise in the present main October-December
season.
Malaysia's cocoa area is estimated to have fallen to 388,700 hectares
(960,000 acres) from 400,300 ha in 1991 and a peak of 420,300 ha in 1990 as
growers, hit by depressed prices, have turned to other crops.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada considers customs
tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA HAS made a substantial concession to its partners in the Uruguay
round by agreeing to consider replacing production quotas and import
controls with customs tariffs to protect dairy, poultry and egg farmers.
Retention of the 'supply management' system has been one of Ottawa's most
pressing concerns during the Uruguay Round. Government officials insist that
customs duties, which could be as high as 300 per cent on some types of
cheese, will provide the same degree of protection for farmers as supply
management. But the realisation is gradually taking hold that far-reaching
reforms - if not the gradual dismantling - of supply-management are
inevitable.
Producers have warned that their survival against lower-cost competitors in
the US and Mexico depends on the quotas and other controls presently
permitted under Article XI of the Gatt. Dairy farmers in Quebec, who make up
40 per cent of the total, exert strong political influence. The government
was especially nervous of offending them in the run-up to last October's
constitutional referendum. In deference to the dairy lobby, Ottawa has
delayed implementing a Gatt finding against curbs on yoghurt and ice cream
imports.
Canada has found little support for its view among other Gatt members, and
its stance on supply management has made life uncomfortable for the
Canadians in the Cairns group of farm-exporting countries. A senior trade
official said that backing expected from Switzerland and Japan has not
materialised, adding 'we cannot impose our views on the rest of the world.'
Pressure for change has also come from food processors which are
increasingly turning to foreign suppliers for items such as frozen pizzas
and butter cookies, which contain dairy products, but less than the 50 per
cent which would subject them to import controls. Supply management has kept
Canadian food prices unusually high. Processors buy milk for 60 Canadian
cents a litre in Ontario; across the Niagara Falls, in New York state, it
costs 32 cents. Although Canadian farmers are almost as efficient as their
US counterparts, the rules allow them to inflate their costs, for instance,
by charging voluntary work done by a teenage son at the same rate as
industrial wages in the nearest town.

<TEXT>
CERRO MATOSO, one of the world's top ferronickel producers, has frozen plans
to build a second furnace at its Colombian refinery because of low world
prices, rising production costs and a government proposal to increase
royalties, reports Reuter from Bogota.
Mr German del Corral, president of the company, which is 52.3 per cent owned
by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said the company decided to suspend the
Dollars 600m project early this month. He explained the decision to suspend
the project, which would have nearly doubled production and made it the
world's second largest producer of the material, was made after the Ministry
of Mines reopened negotiations on royalties and proposed a higher rate.
He said the proposal, which would fix the rate at 15 per cent, rather than
gradually increase it from 8 to 16 per cent as output rose, was the last of
a combination of factors that rendered the project unfeasible.
'There were many negative factors,' he said, citing higher taxes, rising
production costs and a widening gap between local inflation and the
devaluation of the peso.
The world market price of nickel was also a factor, he added. At Dollars
2.70 a lb, it was not worth going ahead with the project.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Freak flooding hits desert
copper mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN COPPER companies are assessing the financial damage they suffered
when freak storms dumped half the average annual rainfall on the Arizona
desert in only ten days. The region accounts for about 10 per cent of the
western world's copper mine production.
The deluge flooded open-pit mines, washed away rail links and diluted the
cyanide solutions used to leach metal from ore dumps more usually drenched
in sunshine.
Companies said yesterday it might take several weeks to gauge the impact on
copper production and add up the extra costs. There are four important
copper producers operating in Arizona - Asarco, Cyprus Minerals, Magma
Copper and Phelps Dodge - with about 15 mines and three smelters.
Mr David Ridinger, president of the Arizona Mining Association, summed up
the situation by pointing out that in an average year the town of Phoenix
expected seven inches of rain. In 1992 double that amount fell on the town -
in January alone this year there was five inches of rain. 'We've been hit by
three or four storms and tornadoes which just would not quit,' he added.
The usually-dry river bed running through Phoenix was now half a mile wide
with 100,000 cubic feet a second of water rushing through. 'We've sometimes
had an inch of rain in half an hour and this is a desert so there's no
vegetation to stop it running.
'Phoenix is not a mining town but miners with property near the river have
been more interested in protecting their homes than going to work,' said Mr
Ridinger.
The mining companies' biggest problem was dealing with the water, he said.
Environmental regulations prevented them from simply pumping water out of
pits threatened with flooding. It had to be pumped to areas - perhaps
disused pits - were it could be contained until it was analysed for any
contamination.
Apart from diluting the cyanide solutions sprinkled on the out-door heaps of
ore, the rain also washed mud into the so-called pregnant ponds where
solutions heavy with metal are stored. This was causing 'gunk problems' when
the solutions were processed.
Rumours that Asarco's smelter at Hayden had been forced to shut because of
the weather conditions were dismissed by the company, which said the plant
had been scheduled to close between January 12 and February 17 for routine
maintenance.
However, Asarco's Hayden concentrator shut down because the rail line
linking it with the Ray mine was flooded. Some metal solution had spilled
into the nearby Mineral Creek but tests showed there had been no
environmental damage and none was expected in future. Asarco said that in
the past ten days there had been 7.5 inches of rain at the Ray mine and in
December there had been 6.9 inches. This compared with average annual
precipitation of 17.5 inches.
Magma had to stop production at its Pinto Valley mine, which has an average
annual output of 90,000 tonnes of copper, because of flooding. An official
said there was at least 26 feet of water in one area. However, Magma's San
Manuel mine and associated smelting/refining operations, accounting for
about 25 per cent of US copper smelting capacity, were not affected.
An official at Phelps Dodge, the biggest US copper group, said: 'We haven't
lost any copper, it's just taking longer to get it out'. The deluge,
however, would increase the group's costs because a Southern Pacific rail
link was washed away and material from the Morenci mine was being sent by
road to the smelter 100 miles away.
Cyprus was also forced to switch concentrate shipments to trucks because the
East Arizona Railways line linked with its Miami smelter was washed away.
A Cyprus official said Arizona producers were swapping copper concentrates
with one another to ensure production continued and sales commitments were
met.

FT  22 JAN 93 / The Property Market: Long haul from bottom of the abyss -
Signs are growing that the US property market may be about to turn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Will the 'new season of American renewal', promised by President Bill
Clinton to the US people this week, signal a revival of its battered
property market?
While the problems of the US property industry remain daunting, some
commentators believe that this will be the year when the long decline in
values bottoms out. '1993 looks to be a turning point for the economy, and
for the real estate industry, too,' says Mr Hugh Kelly, head of economic
research at Landauer Associates, the US real estate advisers. 'By many
measures, the worst of the cycle is behind us.'
Mr Sol Rabin of TCW Realty Advisers, a Los Angeles-based company of property
advisers, agrees. 'Although there is no sign of improvement yet, there are
growing signs that we are at the bottom.'
The fate of the property industry is bound up with the policies of the new
US president. Issues such as trade policy, strengthening the banking system,
increasing tax revenues and the possibility of pump-priming measures 'will
affect the real estate industry sooner rather than later', says Mr Kelly.
'Economic expansion and renewed optimism are necessary preconditions for
real estate to work its way out of its long purgatory,' he says.
But not even the optimists believe that the climb out of the abyss will be
quick or easy. The US real estate market is labouring under the weighty
legacy of the 1980s, when tax breaks and easy money stimulated a big
increase in construction. Some 40 per cent of all the property in the US was
built in the 1980s, according to TCW.
The result was a steep rise in vacancy rates, reaching an average of nearly
20 per cent in downtown office markets. Property analysts calculate that
there is enough vacant office space to give every unemployed person in the
country his or her own 8 ft by 7 ft office.
The result has been a sharp fall in property values of at least 30 per cent
in the last four years, as investors have shied away from the market.
Investment in property has been sharply reduced from Dollars 21bn in 1988 to
less than Dollars 4bn in 1992.
However, potential investors complain that prices are still being kept
artificially high. This has led to a stalemate between buyers, who have
waited for prices to fall further, and sellers, who have been waiting for
them to go back up.
'If the banks were to write down property values enough, investors would
come in,' says Mr Rabin. 'Some of the banks are being unrealistic about
prices.'
The US property market - as in the UK - ultimately depends on demand from
tenants; and demand depends on the strength of the economy. Landauer's
economic projections for this year include a 3 per cent real growth in gross
domestic product, and a net gain of more than 1m jobs.
However, there are significant variations in the prospects for different
markets and regions: The office market saw rents fall by 4.4 per cent and
values fall by 7 per cent in 1992. Prospects are still weak, but there is
scope for encouragement in the decline in supply, which has slowed to a
trickle, and improved demand prospects.
Landauer estimates that an additional 1.38bn office jobs will be created
across the country by 1997. It concludes that 47 per cent of the current
vacant space could be absorbed in the next five years.
The best-placed cities are those with the greatest potential for job
creation in the 1990s. Landauer uses its Office Momentum Index to rank US
cities in terms of supply of and demand for offices: this puts Orlando,
Houston, Seattle and Atlanta as the best markets for the 1990s, although it
rates their prospects as no more than acceptable to good. The likely
resurgence of the Houston property market, which has long been notorious for
a high vacancy rate, is particularly significant.
At the other end of the scale are most of the US's largest markets, such as
Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and New York, which are
'bogged down with immense inventories of empty space and feeble economic
expansion prospects through mid-decade'.
New York, which has lost more than 100,000 office jobs since 1990, is the
worst placed of the 24 US cities monitored by Landauer. 'The weakness in
office rents and values will be a persistent feature here through the latter
part of the decade,' the company says.
The retail market - fears of unemployment and heavy debt burdens are
continuing to restrict consumer spending and depress the retail property
market. This is in spite of low interest rates and hopes of economic
recovery.
The decline in retail property capital values has been far less marked than
for offices, although income returns have lagged nearly every other sector
in the market. Dallas, Seattle and Tampa offer the best prospects, according
to Landauer; among the worst are in Hartford, Richmond and Memphis.
The industrial market has been badly affected by the contraction of
companies such as General Motors and IBM and by reduced military spending,
which has particularly hit the Californian economy.
Nonetheless, there is some comfort in the industrial sector. A Federal
Reserve banking survey last October suggested that manufacturers' optimism
is picking up and, despite continued closures of large plants, the number of
small factories is on the rise. The warehouse market shows some sign of
recovery, particularly in Seattle, Houston and Dallas.
The residential market - although values are still falling, apartments are
the best-performing sector in the property market, as it does not suffer
from the oversupply plaguing other parts of the market. Average vacancy
rates declined from 7.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent in 1992. 'If these rates
continue to fall, significant spikes in average rents should be expected,'
says Landauer.
Falling prices and cheaper mortgages helped the single-family housing market
rebound in 1992, with a 4 per cent rise in volume and a slight increase in
prices. Prospects for a continued improvement in 1993 are modest, however.
The hotel market is probably the hardest hit of all the US commercial
property markets. 'While an office building can harbour an above-market
lease that represents a potential threat to cash flow, hotels must go to
market every night. It is hard to hide problems in this business,' says
Landauer. It adds that 1993 is expected to be another bleak year.
An examination of the prospects for different states and sectors
demonstrates how widespread and severe are the problems facing the US
property market. Hopes of a recovery are fragile and could easily be dashed
by events such as a rise in interest rates.
Probably the best that can be said for the US property industry is that, for
the first time in years, the market runs a chance of being in a better, not
worse, state by the time the year is over.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts buoyed by further batch of bad
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

UK GOVERNMENT bonds rose in busy trading as a further batch of bad economic
data fanned hopes of an early cut in interest rates, in spite of sterling's
weakness.
The pound fell by more than 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday.
Some dealers said that yesterday's figures, combined with Wednesday's
disappointing December retail sales, might force the government to reduce
the base rate further before the budget on March 16.
The 60,800 jump in unemployment last month topped market forecasts of
between 25,000 to 60,000, while the 0.5 per cent monthly fall in
manufacturing output in November fell short of expectations of a flat
result.
There was demand at both the short and long end of the market. The market's
firm tone enabled the Bank of England to sell its remaining holding in the
Pounds 1bn tranche of 7 1/4 per cent gilts due 1998, issued on December 30
last year. As a result of the extra supply at the shorter end, long-dated
gilts outperformed the rest of the market, resulting in a flattening in the
yield curve which had steepened recently on concerns about the forthcoming
auction.
The Liffe March long gilt futures contract closed at 100.20, up  25/32 on
the day in good volume of just over 47,000 lots. The benchmark 9 per cent
gilt due 2008 closed at 102 5/32 , up  3/4 on the day, to yield 8.73 per
cent, down from 8.82 per cent.
GERMAN government bond prices rose slightly in subdued trading, as the
Bundesbank's decision to keep interest rates unchanged was in line with
expectations.
The Liffe March bund futures contract rose to 92.98 from Wednesday's closing
of 92.94, in volume of just over 42,000 contracts. The benchmark 7 1/8 per
cent December 2002 bund was at 100.32 after Wednesday's final price of
100.28.
Dealers said that the forthcoming German money supply data for December and
the preliminary inflation data for January, both due out in the next few
days, might have prevented the central bank from easing.
Dr Richard Reid, chief economist at UBS in Frankfurt, forecasts an
annualised rate of 9.2 per cent for M3 in December, only marginally down on
November's 9.3 per cent.
Furthermore, he points out that this year's rise in VAT is likely to lift
inflation by 1.2 per cent month-on-month in January. This would give a
year-on-year rise of 4.5 per cent compared with 3.7 per cent in December.
VOLUME in the new German medium-term bond (Bobl) future launched yesterday
on Liffe reached an estimated 8,700 contracts on its first day of trading.
According to Liffe, this represents a 40 per cent share of the market, which
Liffe shares with the Deutsche Terminborse, the German exchange.
SPANISH debt held by non-residents rose to Pta1,870bn at the end of last
year from a Pta1,600bn low in mid-November, a clear swing from the net sales
by foreigners of government paper that set in during mid-1992.
Factors rallying the Spanish bond market include ERM improvement, together
with the stability of the peseta, and a recent easing of the interbank
market.
Rates for three-month Treasury bills fell at the mid-week auction by 0.5
points to 13.995 per cent and the 10-year bond price rose by a point to
91.10 per cent.
For the first time since July last year, the 10-year yield dropped below 12
per cent.
US TREASURY prices firmed across the board yesterday as retail buyers moved
into the market after the announcement of the latest Treasury auction passed
peaceably.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond rose  5/16 to 103
27/32 , yielding 7.300 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up
 3/32 at 100 9/16 , to yield 4.301 per cent.
Prices eased in early trading, due to nervousness about the size of next
week's two-year and five-year note auctions, and concern about the
implications for the market of the next refunding round.
However, once the Treasury announced that it would sell Dollars 11.5bn of
five-year notes and Dollars 15.25bn of two-year notes, prices picked up as
corporates and fund managers began buying.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Latin Americans return to foreign debt
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN American borrowers are starting to tap the international bond markets
again after a spell out of favour late last year.
While secondary market yields on Latin American bond issues have declined
from their late-1992 peaks, investment bankers warn that many borrowers from
this region will be forced to issue bonds at more generous yields than seen
in early 1992, reflecting the tail-off in investor demand for Latin American
bonds.
Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), the Mexican state oil company, launched a
five-year Dollars 125m Eurobond issue last week, the first big Latin
American issue this year.
The deal was well received by institutional funds and retail investors.
Launched at a spread of 230 basis points over the five-year US Treasury
yield, it is trading at a yield spread of 228 basis points, according to
Swiss Bank Corporation, the lead manager.
Pemex was able to borrow at tighter terms in the past, achieving a launch
spread of 195 basis points over five-year Treasuries last year, according to
Credit Suisse First Boston.
However, yields on Latin American bond issues widened last autumn as
investors realised that the international bond market was likely to be hit
by an avalanche of Latin American deals. Pemex paper traded at a yield
spread of 300 basis points over US Treasuries in the secondary market,
according to dealers.
CSFB, which was lead manager for a three-year 9 1/2 per cent bond due 1995
from Banco do Brazil, said the issue was launched at a spread of 395 basis
points over US Treasuries, and is quoted at about 510-535 (offer-bid). The
widening in spread reflects investor concern about the political situation
in Brazil as well as the general awareness of the heavy borrowing needs of
Brazilian names.
Now that Pemex has tested investor appetite with a successful bond issue,
investment bankers expect other Latin American borrowers to return to the
market.
Two other Mexican borrowers are expected to launch five-year deals - Hylsa,
the steel company, and ICA, a construction group. One investment banker said
that yield spreads of 550 basis points and 400 basis points respectively had
been mentioned in the market, although no firm launch spreads have been
announced.
'With new issues, the borrowers are going to have to accept higher launch
spreads, even though there is bound to be resistance in the Mexican Finance
Ministry,' said one investment banker. He said several companies needed to
raise finance and therefore would be forced to return to the international
capital markets, whether to launch bond, international equity or convertible
bond issues.
Two Argentine banks - Banco de Galicia and Banco de la Nacion - are expected
to launch bond issues soon.
Another potential borrower - Bancomer, one of the two large Mexican banks -
was to launch a bond, with CSFB as lead manager, but announced earlier this
week that the issue had been delayed. CSFB said it could not say why.
However, some borrowers have stated that they were not prepared to return to
the bond markets because of the less favourable conditions.
The Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), would not
seek fresh financing this year through bond placements on foreign markets
since they were unlikely to be successful, according to a report from
Reuters yesterday.
PDVSA would place about Dollars 250m in bearer bonds on foreign markets, but
only to pay off previous bond issues, a senior official said.
'We are looking for some new ideas, inspecting markets, but if prices stay
the way they are now it would be very difficult for us to go to the
Euromarket,' the official said.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bowater loss blamed on poor
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOWATER, the US newsprint manufacturer, has incurred a Dollars 20.9m
fourth-quarter net loss, which it blamed on poor prices in its main markets.
It forecast that 1993 would be better than last year, but still difficult.
The loss, which worked through at 59 cents a share, on sales of Dollars
398.9m, compared with income of Dollars 1.6m, or 2 cents, on sales of
Dollars 325.9m in the same 1991 period.
For 1992 as a whole, the company suffered a net loss of Dollars 82m, or
Dollars 2.34 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.49bn, against net income of
Dollars 45.6m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.29bn in 1991.
The 1992 results are not directly comparable with the previous year, since
they include Great Northern Paper, which Bowater bought at the end of 1991.
Mr AP Gammie, chairman, said newsprint prices remained at unprofitable
levels, while currency problems and the economic slowdown in Europe had
resulted in a significant drop in market pulp export prices.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Weak demand hurts Monsanto
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONSANTO, the US chemicals group, yesterday posted underlying fourth-quarter
profits which tumbled to Dollars 12m from Dollars 51m, but the company's
balance sheet was cluttered with special items which brought net income to
Dollars 141m, or Dollars 1.14 a share.
Mr Richard Mahoney, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Undeniably, 1992
was a difficult year in which to operate.' The company has been hit by low
prices and weak demand for chemicals and by a poor performance by its Searle
pharmaceutical business.
During the 1992 quarter, Monsanto took an after-tax restructuring charge of
Dollars 425m, or Dollars 3.44 a share. This was more than offset by a gain
of Dollars 554m, or Dollars 4.49, from the sale of its Fisher Controls unit.
A year earlier, Monsanto had net income of Dollars 66m, or 53 cents, on
sales of Dollars 1.89bn. Earnings included Dollars 15m from Fisher Controls.
Sales in the 1992 quarter slipped 1.6 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn, while the
cost of goods sold rose 12.5 per cent to Dollars 1.26bn, leaving Monsanto
with a 21.6 per cent decline in gross profit to Dollars 603m from Dollars
769m.
For the full year, Monsanto had a net loss of Dollars 88m, or 71 cents, on
sales of Dollars 7.8bn, against net earnings of Dollars 296m, or Dollars
2.33, on revenues of Dollars 7.9bn.
In 1992, Monsanto adopted new accounting standards for a cumulative charge
Dollars 540m. Income was further reduced by special charges of Dollars 47m.
Restructuring charges in 1991 reduced after-tax earnings by Dollars 325m, or
Dollars 2.54.
Monsanto, which is cutting about 3,200 jobs, mainly at Searle, said Searle's
underlying operating income fell in the quarter after stripping out charges
of Dollars 265m for cost cutting.
The company said underlying operating income for its agricultural group
increased significantly in the fourth quarter, led by improved sales of its
Roundup herbicide.
Underlying operating profits from its chemical group declined in the latest
quarter, reflecting weak industrial demand and disappointing prices and
sales volumes in Europe.
On Wall Street, shares in Monsanto rose Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 53
1/8.

<TEXT>
SARA LEE, the Chicago-based food and consumer goods concern, hoisted
earnings to a record Dollars 220m, or 44 cents a share, in the second
quarter, up 15.9 per cent from last year's Dollars 190m, or 38 cents per
share.
Sales advanced to Dollars 3.8bn, also a record and a rise of 6.8 per cent on
Dollars 3.6bn in the 1991 quarter.
For the first six months, the group's earnings were Dollars 362m, down from
the first half of fiscal 1992 when the sale of the company's European-based
over-the-counter pharmaceutical business added a one-time gain that pushed
earnings up to Dollars 453m.
Excluding the gain, first-half earnings per share were 72 cents, up from 63
cents a year ago.
Sara Lee's sales for the first six months of the fiscal year climbed to
Dollars 7.4bn from Dollars 6.7bn a year ago.
Operating income from packaged meats and bakery businesses was up 7.8 per
cent in the quarter at Dollars 81m, and coffee and grocery earnings were up
8.6 per cent at Dollars 73m.
European volume for retail coffee rose 2 per cent in the quarter and 3 per
cent in the first six months of the fiscal year.

DESPITE improvements in most of its government aerospace programmes, St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas reported 1992 full-year earnings well below
those of 1991 because of large loss provisions for its controversial C-17
military transport programme and lower earnings from its commercial aircraft
segment.
Company executives forecast stronger cash-flow in 1993, with Mr Herbert
Lanese, chief financial officer, stating that cost-cutting and
previously-announced asset sales would generate Dollars 1bn in cash flow
next year. The company's total aerospace debt fell to Dollars 2.77bn at the
end of 1992, down from Dollars 2.86bn on September 30.
'Most of our businesses are now getting good competitive returns by industry
standards,' Mr John McDonnell, McDonnell Douglas chairman said. 'We expect
the C-17 programme to be profitable in 1993, as we complete the transition
from development into production. Except for the C-17 programme, our
government aerospace programmes, as a group, had their best earnings in
corporate history.'
The news boosted McDonnell Douglas stock, which was trading up Dollars 2 1/2
at Dollars 56 1/2 at close of trade.
Before special charges and additions made for a new benefits accounting
rule, McDonnell Douglas reported fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 86m or
Dollars 2.20 a share, compared with Dollars 211m or Dollars 5.50 a share in
1991. The 1991 results included earnings of Dollars 74m or Dollars 1.93 a
share from discontinued operations and a gain of 83 cents a share from a tax
settlement.
For the full year, the company had earnings of Dollars 161m or Dollars 4.15
a share, down from Dollars 423m or Dollars 11.03 in 1991. Fourth-quarter
sales were Dollars 4.62bn, compared with Dollars 4.68bn last year and
full-year sales were Dollars 17.3bn, compared with Dollars 18.0bn a year
ago.
The company's order backlog on December 31 was Dollars 24bn, against Dollars
30.4bn a year earlier.

ALCAN Australia, a 73 per cent-owned subsidiary of Alcan Aluminium of
Canada, yesterday announced its third consecutive annual loss and forecast
further difficulties in the current year. The board said it would pass the
dividend for the second consecutive year.
Alcan said it made a net loss of ADollars 15.5m (USDollars 10.6m) for 1982
against a loss of ADollars 28.9m in 1991. Revenue was down from ADollars
590m to ADollars 576m despite a 3.7 per cent rise in sales volume.
The group made a pre-tax profit of ADollars 1.2m, against a loss of ADollars
29.2m previous yearly. The gain reflected efficiency improvements and cost
cuts.

TOYOTA, the leading Japanese carmaker, is to invest more than Dollars 75m in
the US to create a North American parts operation with the aim of increasing
the use of replacement parts purchased in the US to more than 50 per cent by
1995, writes Kevin Done, Motor Industry Correspondent.
Of this sum, Dollars 67m will be invested in a new parts warehouse in
Ontario, California, which is planned to begin operations by early 1996.
The remainder will be invested in new parts ordering and distribution
systems.
The facility, which will be one of the largest Toyota parts centres in the
world, will have a stock of around 200,000 different components.

TAKING ADVANTAGE of new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules that
allow companies more flexibility in registering securities offerings, UAL
and its subsidiary, United Airlines, announced plans yesterday to raise as
much as Dollars 1.5bn through sales of new debt, equity and other

UAL said the money would be used for general corporate purposes, including
'the repayment of outstanding debt and the financing of capital expenditures
by United Airlines'.
UAL said it would raise the funds through any combination of debt
securities, debt warrants, and equipment trust and pass-through certificates
of United Airlines, and of convertible debt, preferred stock, convertible
preferred stock and common stock of UAL.
Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co, the securities broking and credit card operation
soon to be sold off by retailing group Sears, Roebuck, has filed plans with
the SEC to raise Dollars 3bn through the sale of debt securities.

WANG Laboratories, the US computer group, announced yesterday that Mr
Richard Miller, chairman and chief executive, had resigned.
Three executives were named to lead the company as it prepares to emerge
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy prot-ection.
Wang, which has been cutting its operations for the past year, said it would
eventually halt manufacturing.
Mr Miller said he had proposed stepping down 'because the company needs to
finalise a smaller and less-costly management structure that will lead the
company into the future.'
Mr Michael Mee, formerly an executive vice-president, was named as Wang's
new chairman and chief financial officer.
He said Wang would continue to refocus its business on imaging software and
services. 'Over time,' Mr Mee said, 'Wang will exit manufacturing.'
Mr Joseph Tucci, who was named as president and chief executive, said that
plans to reduce manufacturing were likely to affect plants in Taiwan,
Ireland and Australia. He said Wang had about 1,000 manufacturing employees.
A Wang official said the company was in the process of selling its Taiwan
plant to a group of investors. Similar arrangements might be made in Ireland
and Australia, he suggested.
In addition to the appointments of Mr Mee and Mr Tucci, Mr Donald Casey was
named as president and chief development officer.

economic slowdown

<TEXT>
SAINT GOBAIN, the French glass and building materials group, yesterday
announced a drop in net profits to FFr2.37bn (Dollars 438m) last year, a 5.5
per cent drop from the previous year's performance.
The fall is in line with the lower expectations of the depressed
construction sector.
The effect of the economic slowdown was evident in the group's turnover,
which fell by 1.6 per cent to FFr73.9bn last year, despite full
incorporation of the activity of St Gobain's newly-acquired German
glassmaking subsidiary, Oberland. Without Oberland, the drop in business
would have been 4 per cent.
St Gobain described business as poor everywhere except the US, which had
shown a marked pick-up in activity in the last months of 1992, putting
pressure on prices.
Extraordinary items, including asset sales, had provided some buoyancy to
last year's results, the company said.
Earlier this month, the group sold 24 per cent of its stake in Coverland of
France to Redland, the UK construction group and sold two companies in
Italy.
As a result, its net debt fell from FFr20.5bn at end-1991 to FFr18.4bn at
end-1992.

BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, one of the world's biggest pharmaceuticals companies,
increased underlying fourth-quarter earnings by 9 per cent to Dollars 540m,
or Dollars 1.05 a share.
Figures were muddied by one-time items, including expenses from adoption of
the new accounting standard, restructuring charges and the sale of its
Drackett household products unit. Including these items, fourth-quarter net
earnings were Dollars 583m, or Dollars 1.13, against Dollars 510m, or 98
cents, a year ago.
Sales were flat at Dollars 2.8bn. Although international sales rose 8 per
cent in the quarter, domestic sales fell 5 per cent, reflecting a decline in
pharmaceuticals sales.
For 1992, net income was Dollars 1.96bn, or Dollars 3.79, against Dollars
2.06bn, or Dollars 3.95. Stripping out special items, Bristol-Myers said its
1992 net profits increased 7 per cent to Dollars 2.12bn, or Dollars 4.10.
Sales rose 6 per cent to Dollars 11.2bn, excluding sales from Drackett.
During the fourth quarter, the company took pre-tax restructuring charges of
Dollars 890m and charges of Dollars 390m for new accounting standards. The
sale of Drackett brought in Dollars 952m before taxes.
Pfizer, a US ethical pharmaceutical producer, posted a 39 per cent
improvement in fourth-quarter net earnings from operations, reflecting the
strength of several new drugs.
Stripping out one-time items, Pfizer earned Dollars 264.8m, or 80 cents in
the quarter.
Including extraordinary items, Pfizer reported fourth-quarter net income of
Dollars 278.8m, or 83 cents.
Pfizer, which has not yet settled the litigation surrounding its Shiley
heart valves, took a 58 cents a share charge for potential heart valve
fracture claims in the 1991 fourth quarter which brought net income for the
period to Dollars 900,000 or Dollars 0.00 a share.
Sales in the latest quarter stood at 1.95bn up 5 per cent from Dollars
1.85bn.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Texaco declines to Dollars 313m
after charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECIAL charges resulted in fourth-quarter 1992 net profit at Texaco, the US
energy group, declining to Dollars 313m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, from
Dollars 324m, or Dollars 1.15, in the corresponding period of 1991.
Revenues for the quarter were down marginally at Dollars 9.7bn, against
Dollars 9.75bn.
For the whole of 1992 Texaco's net profit slumped 45 per cent to Dollars
712m or Dollars 2.37 per share.
However, this figure included a Dollars 300m charge for changes in
accounting principles. Revenues for 1992 were Dollars 37.7bn, down from
Dollars 38.3bn in 1991.
Mr James Kinnear, outgoing Texaco chief executive, said that beyond special
charges, the decline in 1992 profits occurred primarily from soft market
conditions for refined products, crude oil market conditions and a generally
difficult business environment.
But he added that Texaco realised cash savings of about Dollars 500m in 1992
from reductions in operating and overhead expenses.
Texaco said its fourth-quarter operating income before taking the charges
was Dollars 416m, up from Dollars 295m in the last quarter of 1991.
Despite tax benefits of Dollars 40m, the fourth-quarter net profit was
depressed by special charges, including a special write-off of Dollars 34m
caused by property damage from a fire at Los Angeles refinery and Hurricane
Andrew.
In addition, there were Dollars 58m of payments for staff severance and
Dollars 64m for charges associated with asset-writedowns and reserves for
environmental clean-up matters.
On Wall Street, Texaco's share price declined Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 58 at
the close.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Obstacles beset PC manufacturer
 -Borland faces growing competition and a price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST a year ago, Borland International was one of the fastest-growing
companies in the personal computer software industry.
The Scotts Valley, California, software developer had cemented its
leadership in the database management program market with the acquisition of
Ashton-Tate, and expectations were high for several new products.
Today, with some of these products still yet to be delivered, Borland is
facing mounting competition and its growth has ground to a halt. The
company's stock, which reached a peak of Dollars 86 3/4 in January 1992, has
been trading this week at under Dollars 18 after disappointing third-quarter
results.
On revenues down 9 per cent at Dollars 104.3m, Borland reported losses of
Dollars 61.3m, or Dollars 2.34 a share, compared with net profits of Dollars
7.5m, or 28 cents, in the same period last year. The results included
charges of Dollars 34.8m for 350 job cuts announced in December,
consolidation of facilities, and inventory write-downs.
Borland is now engaged in a potentially crippling price war with PC software
market leader Microsoft and other competitors as it makes a long-delayed
entry into the market for applications programs that run with the popular
Microsoft Windows software.
The delays have cost Borland dearly, forcing it to sit on the sidelines as
sales of Windows applications programs soared to an estimated Dollars 2.9bn
last year, an increase of 238 per cent over 1991, according to a market
study published this week by Dataquest, the US market research group.
To make matters worse, when Borland finally launched a Windows version of
Quattro Pro, its spreadsheet program, in September, the company blundered by
packaging the new program with an existing DOS version of Quattro Pro.
The bundled software was supposed to appeal to a broad range of users,
including those who use either Windows or DOS. But Borland has since
acknowledged that instead it caused confusion. It withdrew the package in
December and relaunched Quattro Pro for Windows as a separate product at a
steeply discounted price. Third-quarter revenues were reduced by Dollars
10.7m, the company said, because retailers would receive rebates on their
earlier purchases of the Quattro Pro product.
The price battle began in November, when Microsoft invaded Borland's most
prized territory, the market for database management programs, with the
introduction of Access, a PC database program for use with Windows. Offered
at an introductory price of Dollars 99, about one-fifth of the price of
Borland's established database products, Access has taken the market by
storm and Microsoft expects to sell 750,000 copies by the end of this month.
Firing back, Borland has announced a new 'introductory price' for Quattro
Pro Windows of Dollars 99, down from Dollars 495.
The company also said that when it finally begins shipping Paradox for
Windows, the first of two new database management programs, it too will be
heavily discounted to Dollars 149 for 90 days.
'Borland is celebrating its two-pronged entry in the Windows market with
this promotion,' said Mr Philippe Kahn, chairman, president, and chief
executive.
Financial analysts, however, are already counting the cost and lowering
estimates for Borland's fourth-quarter earnings.
In the longer term, it appears the 'introductory prices' being offered by
Borland and Microsoft could establish new expectations among customers for
downward price trends like those for PC hardware.
Software developers may have a difficult time persuading buyers to pay
higher prices, analysts warn.
While the price war wages, Borland is also battling in the courts with Lotus
Development. Last year, Lotus won a copyright infringement suit filed
against Borland in July 1990, forcing Borland to cut certain features out of
its Quattro Pro products. Last week, however, Lotus charged that the revised
versions of Quattro Pro still infringe its copyrights.
Borland is confident it will ultimately prevail in the dispute. However, if
Lotus wins then Borland may be forced to pay damages, possibly amounting to
millions of dollars.

ALCAN Australia, a 73 per cent owned subsidiary of Alcan Aluminium of
Canada, yesterday announced its third consecutive annual loss and forecast
further difficulties in the current year. The board said it would pass the
dividend for the second consecutive year.
Alcan said it made a net loss of ADollars 15.5m (USDollars 10.6m) for the 12
months to the end of December, compared with a loss of ADollars 28.9m in the
previous year. Revenue was down from ADollars 590m to ADollars 576m despite
a 3.7 per cent rise in sales volume.
The group made a pre-tax profit of ADollars 1.2m, compared with a loss of
ADollars 29.2m in the previous year. It said the improvement reflected
efficiency improvements and cost-cutting.
However, the return to profit was offset by a loss of ADollars 17m on
currency translations caused by the effect on the group's US dollar loans of
a fall in the value of the Australian dollar to 68.88 US cents from 74.77
cents.
Alcan said no improvement in aluminium prices was expected in the short
term. 'We expect 1993 to be a difficult year, but intend to make further
progress in improving costs and competitiveness,' the board said.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Equity underwriting slide
depresses Bear Stearns

<TEXT>
BEAR STEARNS, the US securities house, yesterday reported a 17 per cent
decline in second-quarter profits to Dollars 64.3m, the latest indication
that the boom in Wall Street earnings slowed down at the end of last year.
The main feature of the quarter, which covered the period from October to
December, was a sharp fall in equity underwriting volume, which led to a 34
per cent decline in Bear Stearns' investment banking revenues to Dollars
63.2m.
There was a similar, if less pronounced, setback in trading earnings, which
slipped nearly 3 per cent to Dollars 231.6m in the wake of less favourable
conditions in fixed-income markets.
Interest income also contributed to the overall decline, falling to Dollars
225.5m, from Dollars 260.3m a year ago.
Bear Stearns' other main line of business, however, put in a strong
second-quarter performance.
Revenues from broking commissions jumped to Dollars 105.5m, up from Dollars
97.7m at the same stage of fiscal 1992, as a result of higher equity trading
volume and an increase in the number of the firm's correspondent clearing
clients.
Bear Stearns is the second brokerage firm this week to report lower
quarterly earnings because of a downturn in investment banking and trading
revenues.
This indicates that business conditions in the final three months of 1992
were nothing like as profitable as in the first three quarters of last year,
when Wall Street firms were firing on all cylinders.
The final three months of 1992, however, may turn out to have been a brief
interruption of an upward trend.
The first few weeks of 1993 have opened strongly for the securities
industry, with extremely heavy trading of equities, and record levels of new
corporate debt coming to the market.
Mr Alan Greenberg, chairman of Bear Stearns, said yesterday: 'Business has
been good since the beginning of January, and we hope it will continue.'

energy group, declining to Dollars 313m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, from
Dollars 324m, or Dollars 1.15, in the corresponding period of 1991. Revenues
for the quarter were down marginally at Dollars 9.7bn, against Dollars
9.75bn.
For the whole of 1992 Texaco's net profit slumped by 45 per cent to Dollars
712m (Dollars 2.37 per share).
This figure, however, included a Dollars 300m charge for changes in
accounting principles. Revenues for 1992 were Dollars 37.7bn, down from
Dollars 38.3bn in 1991.
Mr James Kinnear, outgoing Texaco chief executive, said that beyond special
charges, the decline in 1992 profits occurred primarily from soft market
conditions for refined products, crude oil market conditions and a generally
difficult business environment.
But he added that in 1992 Texaco realised cash savings of about Dollars 500m
from reductions in operating and overhead expenses.
Texaco said its fourth-quarter operating income before taking the charges
was Dollars 416m, up from Dollars 295m in the last quarter of 1991.
Despite tax benefits of Dollars 40m, the fourth-quarter net profit was
depressed by special charges. These included a special write-off of Dollars
34m caused by property damage from a fire at Los Angeles refinery and
Hurricane Andrew.
In addition, there were Dollars 58m of payments for staff severance payments
and Dollars 64m for charges associated with asset-writedowns and reserves
for environmental clean-up matters.
Operating earnings from US petroleum and natural gas exploration and
production in 1992 were Dollars 543m, down from Dollars 605m. Non-US
exploration and production operating profits were Dollars 416m in 1992,
against Dollars 421m in 1991.
Manufacturing and marketing operating income in the US was Dollars 276m in
1992, against Dollars 188m in 1991, and Dollars 300m outside the US, down
from Dollars 647m in 1991.
Total capital and exploration spending in 1992 was Dollars 3.15bn worldwide,
against Dollars 3.57bn in 1991. On Wall Street, Texaco's share price was
Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 57 3/4 before the close.

systems

<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric of the US reported a 6 per cent increase in fourth-quarter
earnings, helped by an improving domestic economy and strong shipments from
its power systems business.
The company made Dollars 1.34bn, compared with Dollars 1.26bn in the same
period of 1991. Earnings per share rose 8 per cent from Dollars 1.46 to
Dollars 1.57, and revenues rose from Dollars 17.6bn to Dollars 17.8bn.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said GE was 'better positioned than ever before,
with a strong balance sheet, very strong cash-flows and excellent prospects
for earnings growth'.
In 1992 overall, GE's earnings rose 7 per cent to Dollars 4.72bn, while its
share repurchase programme helped lift earnings per share 8 per cent to
Dollars 5.51. Revenues rose 3 per cent to Dollars 62.2bn.
GE estimated that earnings from continuing operations - excluding its
aerospace division, being sold to Martin Marietta - would show a rise of
around 10 per cent.
Mr Welch said the performance in 1992 had been led by double-digit earnings
increases at GE Financial Services, Power Systems and Medical Services.
He added that the year's operating highlight was 'the increasing ability of
the businesses to turn the rhetoric of 'speed' into reality, as demonstrated
by record inventory turnover and productivity of nearly 5 per cent during a
period of slow global growth.
'This not only increased earnings but also translated into a record Dollars
5.3bn in operating cash-flow, some Dollars 1.3bn over 1991 results.'
Earnings at GE Financial Services totalled Dollars 1.499bn for the year, 18
per cent up on 1991's Dollars 1.275bn. GE Capital, the main financial
services arm, saw double-digit earnings growth, and Kidder, Peabody, the
securities house, achieved 'sharply improved' results.

POLAROID, the US camera and films group, expects to report 1992 operating
profit 'significantly lower' than in 1991 due to a sharp decline in
fourth-quarter European film sales, Reuter reports.
Fourth-quarter European sales were hurt by the recession, but worldwide
sales held up reasonably well through the first three quarters and, with the
exception of Europe, through the fourth quarter.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: PTTEP to lead Thai privatisation
drive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PTT Exploration and Production, part of the state-owned Petroleum Authority
of Thailand (PTT), will lead a 1993 privatisation drive by Thai companies
involved in the oil business when it offers shares to the public over the
next few weeks.
PTTEP wants foreign investors to buy a substantial number of the new shares,
and there will be 'roadshows' in Hong Kong and London in mid-February to
publicise the forthcoming flotation on the Stock Exchange of Thailand.
'It's the first privatisation from here in recent years to have a specific
portion targeted at the international investor,' said Mr Tira Wannamethee,
director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Thailand. BZW and Goldman Sachs are
lead co-ordinators and advisers for the offer.
On offer are nearly 40m shares, representing 15 per cent of the company's
enlarged share capital. Of these, 24m are being set aside for Thai and 16m
for foreign investors, although the foreign portion could be reduced by 4m
if domestic demand is exceptionally high.
The price will not be set until about February 22, but it is thought that
PTTEP is seeking to raise between Bt1.2bn (Dollars 47m) and Bt1.5bn, which
suggests a price of around Bt35 a share and values the company at more than
Bt8bn.
PTTEP shares should be listed on the SET in April. Other oil-related
companies hoping to come to the market soon are Thai Oil and Bangchak
Petroleum, both refiners, and the 51 per cent state-owned National
Petrochemical Corp.
'Oil is the biggest industry in Thailand and completely unrepresented on the
market,' said Mr Ted Pulling of brokers W. I. Carr in Bangkok.
PTTEP has stakes in three projects already producing oil and gas in
Thailand, and in the development of the Bongkot offshore gasfield. The
company is also exploring another offshore bloc together with British Gas
and negotiating with Total for a share in the development of Burma's
offshore Martaban gasfield.
Another tranche of the company is likely to be sold to the public in a
couple of years, as cash-flow improves and debt is reduced with the help of
the expected revenue stream from Bongkot. In 1991, total revenue rose to
Bt1.32bn from Bt1.29bn in 1990, while net income fell to Bt247m from Bt283m.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Toyota to create US parts
facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOYOTA, the leading Japanese carmaker, is to invest more than Dollars 75m in
the US to create a new North American parts operation with the aim of
increasing the use of replacement parts purchased in the US to more than 50
per cent by 1995.
Of this sum,Dollars 67m will be invested in a new parts warehouse in
Ontario, California, which is planned to begin operations by early 1996. The
remainder will be invested in new parts ordering and distribution systems.
The facility, which will be one of the largest Toyota parts centres in the
world, will have a stock of around 200,000 different components.
Toyota said that the new organisation would cut the lead-time for supplying
parts to its North American distributors from 40 to seven days by moving
replacement parts inventories from Japan to the US. Distributors' parts
inventory would also be cut by Dollars 100m.
Toyota's domestic production of cars and commercial vehicles in Japan fell
by 3.8 per cent last year to 3,931,341, the company reported in Tokyo.
Domestic car output declined by only 0.3 per cent to 3,171,311, while truck
and bus production dropped steeply by 16 per cent to 760,030.
Overseas vehicle output rose sharply, however, with a 14.1 per cent increase
to 764,292 helped largely by the expansion of production in North America.
In Europe, Toyota opened its first car assembly plant in December with the
start-up of its Pounds 700m plant located in the UK.
Toyota's total vehicle exports from Japan declined marginally by 0.3 per
cent to 1,698,236, but of this total car exports rose by 3.6 per cent to
1,269,180. The group's new car registrations in Japan fell by 8.9 per cent
to 1,574,308.

<TEXT>
AMDAHL, the US mainframe computer manufacturer, returned to profitability in
the fourth quarter and increased revenues by about 27 per cent over
third-quarter levels.
Net income for the fourth quarter amounted Dollars 2.5m, or 2 cents a share,
on revenues of Dollars 745m. This compared with a net loss of Dollars 12.7m,
or 11 cents, on revenues of Dollars 389.9m, in the corresponding period a
year ago.
For the full year, the company recorded a loss of Dollars 7m, or 6 cents a
share after charges of 11 cents a share to cover costs of a 9 per cent
reduction in workforce completed in November.
In 1991, Amdahl reported net income of Dollars 10.6m, or 10 cents per share,
including a tax credit of 6 cents.
Revenues for 1992 rose 48 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn from Dollars 1.7bn in
1991.
The rise in fourth-quarter revenues reflects the normal cyclical pattern in
which the largest number of mainframe computer purchases were typically made
near year-end, said Mr Joseph Zemke, Amdahl president and chief executive.
Sales of data storage products also increased substantially, he added.
Mr Zemke noted, however, that prices have been under competitive pressure
for much of the year, cutting into profit margins.
He remained guarded in his outlook for 1993, particularly the first quarter
which is generally the weakest quarter of the year.
Tandem Computers announced a 6 per cent increase in first-quarter revenues,
which rose to Dollars 483.9m. Net income was Dollars 17.5m, or 16 cents per
share, including a gain of Dollars 12.4m, or 11 cents, from a change in
accounting for income taxes.
In the same quarter a year ago, the company reported a net loss of Dollars
94.6m, or 88 cents a share, after a pre-tax restructuring charge of Dollars
98m.
Marketing sales and general expenses declined for the first quarter, Tandem
said. As well as continuing to cut costs, it is considering finding partners
to invest in some of its subsidiaries.

<TEXT>
ANGLO-AMERICAN, the world's largest gold producer, increased attributable
profits at its gold operations by 33 per cent to R202.7m (Dollars 66m) in
the December quarter from the preceding three months to September.
Gold production rose 2 per cent to 66,399kg, while average revenue for the
quarter was R34,040 per kg, a 3 per cent rise from the previous quarter.
Average unit costs were reduced by 1 per cent to R26,387 per kg.
Announcing the group's results, Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and
uranium division, said he was bullish about gold price prospects. He noted
that large sales of gold reserves by the Dutch central bank had failed
substantially to depress the price at the end of last year, adding: 'We
think that's a sign that the gold market is quite capable of absorbing quite
large tonnages of gold'.
He believed further sales of gold reserves would keep the price in a narrow
band until the end of the year, when he expected a 'considerable
improvement'. 'There should be a genuine long-term upward shift in the gold
price towards the end of the year as the world economy improves,' he said.
Mr Lionel Hewitt, the division's managing director, said Freegold's 25.8 per
cent increase in attributable profit, which rose to R75.5m, was driven by an
increase in gold production and higher revenue.
Vaal Reefs recorded a 7.7 per cent rise in attributable profit for the 1992
year, rising to R212.2m. Production and revenues were flat, but costs were
slightly down, yielding the profit increase.
At Western Deep Levels, attributable profit for the year to December fell by
20.1 per cent to R86.4m.

1.29bn full-year loss
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate, reported a fourth-quarter net
loss of Dollars 1.18bn and full-year loss of Dollars 1.29bn as it took a
large and previously-announced charge to cover the disposal of its troubled
financial services business.
However, its fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations was also
down, due primarily to a decline in earnings at its electronic systems
operations and the dilution of earnings per share through a preferred stock
issue.
Mr Paul Lego, the chairman, warned the group's first-quarter results might
be below those for the same period of 1992, due to lower-than-expected order
rates. He said the aim was to have better results for the full 1993 year,
with improvement coming in the second half.
The fourth-quarter net loss was Dollars 3.44 a share against profits of
Dollars 171m, or 51 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales and
revenues were little changed at Dollars 2.35bn, against Dollars 2.36bn.
Westinghouse took a special charge of Dollars 1.28bn for the disposal of its
financial services business.
Net income from continuing operations in the quarter was Dollars 91m, or 22
cents, against Dollars 137m, or 41 cents a year ago.
For the full year, it reported net income from continuing operations of
Dollars 348m, or 93 cents, against Dollars 265m, or 84 cents, in 1991. Its
net loss was Dollars 1.29bn, or Dollars 3.81 a share, against a net loss of
Dollars 1.09bn, or Dollars 3.46 a share in 1991.

maker

<TEXT>
NIPPON Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, is close to acquiring a 60 per
cent stake in NMB Semiconductor, an ailing Japanese electronics company, in
a deal that highlights the extensive restructuring under way in Japan's
manufacturing industry.
The steel company confirmed negotiations with Minebea, the world's leading
maker of miniature bearings, which founded NMBS in 1984 and still holds 60
per cent. The deal is estimated to be worth Y30bn (Dollars 240m). NMBS is
listed on Tokyo's over-the-counter market.
The Japan Securities Dealers' Association suggested yesterday that it would
investigate recent trading patterns in NMBS shares, which have risen from
Y425,000 to Y958,000 since December 22 on volumes 40 times larger than in
early December. Trading in the shares was suspended yesterday.
NMBS is a maker of memory chips, which have suffered sharp falls in price
over the past two years in an increasingly competitive international market.
It reported a loss of Y12.4bn in the year to September and forecast a loss
of Y4bn this year.
Minebea has transferred managers to the company and pumped in fresh funds
over the past few years, but the bearings maker has been badly bruised by
the collapse of stock prices and the failure of several diversification
projects. Last year, Minebea reported a consolidated loss of Y13.6bn.
For Nippon Steel, the acquisition of NMBS would broaden its electronics
expertise after initial failure in producing personal computers.
Several other Japanese steelmakers, including Kawasaki Steel, Kobe Steel and
NKK, have already begun semiconductor production, but the projects, until
now, have been generally unsuccessful.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WARNER, the leading US media and entertainment group, yesterday said it
would redeem Dollars 2.5bn worth of convertible preferred stock.
The share buy-back provides firm evidence of the company's previously-stated
intention to reduce its bank debt and the cost of preferred stock dividends,
both of which have been a heavy burden on the balance sheet.
Prior to yesterday's announcement - which will lead to the redemption of 45m
shares of Time Warner's Series D preferred stock - the company had a total
of Dollars 6.5bn of preferred stock outstanding. Dividend payments for this,
which was issued as a result of the 1989 agreement by Time to merge with
Warner Communications, cost the company Dollars 579m in 1991.
Following the Dollars 2.5bn redemption there will still be Dollars 1bn of
Series D and Dollars 3.1bn of Series C preferred stock outstanding. The Time
Warner board yesterday also authorised the future repurchase of the 20m
remaining shares of Series D stock.
The funds for the Dollars 2.5bn buy- back have come from Time Warner's
recent issue of a Dollars 1bn debenture and some Dollars 1.5bn of other debt
securities.
Mr Gerald Levin, Time Warner's newly-named chairman, said the repurchase
would have a positive impact on operating results and would also reduce the
future number of potential outstanding common shares.
The redemption price per share of the 45m Series D 11 per cent convertible
exchangeable preferred stock is Dollars 53.85 plus 53.47 cents of accrued
and unpaid dividends to the redemption date, making for a total of Dollars
54.38 per share.
Time Warner, which has moved to lower its gearing since Mr Levin became sole
chief executive, has other plans to reduce its debt burden. These include
the possible sale of up to Dollars 3bn of non-strategic assets over coming
years.
In late 1991, Toshiba and C. Itoh of Japan committed a total of Dollars 1bn
to buy a 12.5 per cent stake of TWE, Time's film, cable programming and
cable operations assets.
On Wall Street, the price of Time Warner's common stock rose Dollars 1/4 to
close at Dollars 32 3/8.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: KOP losses set to double to
FM3.5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, said yesterday it
was set to make a FM3.5bn (Dollars 643.8m) pre-tax loss in 1992, more than
double the FM1.64bn deficit recorded a year earlier.
Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chief executive, said it was unlikely that the
bank would return to profit before 1995. 'We expect credit losses in 1993 to
be as high as last year, when they were nearly FM4bn, and for there to be
some improvement in 1994, but it all depends on the development of the
Finnish economy.'
He added that it was 'almost certain' that the bank would need a capital
injection this year, either through a rights issue or through support from
the government, or possibly a combination of both. The bank estimates its
current capital adequacy ratio at 8.5 per cent.
Last year, KOP received a FM1.7bn preference capital injection from the
Finnish government, but so far it has not sought funds from the state
guarantee fund.
The huge 1992 loss is symptomatic of the crisis in Finnish banking, which
has been plagued by recession and bad debts. The government has recently
promised a further FM30bn in support for the banking system, taking the
total available to FM50bn.
In the first eight months of 1992, KOP recorded a FM2.53bn loss as credit
losses soared to FM2.4bn. It warned at that stage that write-offs for the
full year would total FM3.6bn and its overall loss would exceed FM3bn.
Mr Voutilainen said the bank's figures had improved slightly in the final
four months of the year, compared with the first eight months, because of
better margins and a good performance from the Treasury division.
But he was still gloomy about the immediate outlook because of the credit
losses being suffered by small and medium-sized businesses and a Finnish
unemployment rate which now exceeds 18 per cent.
A plan to cut 1,500 jobs through 1992 and 1993 should produce annual savings
of FM500m, said Mr Voutilainen. The bank planned to sell off some FM3-FM4bn
in real estate - about half of its portfolio - to further strengthen its
capital base.
Mr Voutilainen said KOP, which is merging with STS-Bank, Finland's
sixth-largest bank, had made preliminary contact with the state about a
possible merger with the Savings Bank of Finland and Skopbank.
Unitas, KOP's main rival, abandoned talks to buy Skopbank from the
government guarantee fund last October.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Buoyant Sandoz raises turnover
to SFr14.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SANDOZ, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, yesterday shrugged
off the slow-down in the world economy when it announced turnover up 8 per
cent from SFr13.35bn (Dollars 9.5bn) to SFr14.42bn for 1992. The improvement
was mainly driven by the pharmaceuticals and nutrition divisions.
Profit figures were not given, but Sandoz said it expected the operating
performance of the divisional companies to result in a substantial rise in
group profits. In 1991, the group generated net profits of SFr1.1bn.
Pharmaceuticals sales improved 9 per cent from SFr6.27bn to SFr6.87bn,
driven chiefly by prescription medicines. The over-the-counter business also
did well, the company said. In local currencies, the rise was also 9 per
cent.
Sandoz's nutrition division's turnover rose 13 per cent from SFr1.54bn to
SFr1.75bn.
Turnover in the chemicals division increased 4 per cent from SFr2.36bn to
SFr2.45bn. Most of the growth was in the Americas and Asia.
The agrochemicals division suffered from the reform of the EC's Common
Agricultural Policy. However, the introduction of new products helped sales
increase 6 per cent from SFr1.16bn to SFr1.23bn. In local currencies
turnover rose 3 per cent. Revenues from the seeds division increased 7 per
cent from SFr950m to SFr1.02bn. In local currencies the increase was 3 per
cent.
The construction and environment division's turnover improved 3 per cent
from SFr1.07bn to SFr1.1bn, despite low construction volume.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Shuwa adds to Japanese
retailers' woes with forced stock selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S retail sector, battered by a sharp downturn in consumer spending and
falling profits, suffered a further blow yesterday when Shuwa, the troubled
Japanese stock and real estate speculator, was seen as a forced seller of a
number of retail share stakes.
Shuwa is under pressure to sell its stock holdings in order to reduce
borrowings. Reports that Shuwa was selling its stake in leading department
stores, Isetan and Matsuzakaya, undermined confidence on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, prompting Matsuzakaya to fall by its daily limit of Y200 or 16.3
per cent to Y1,020 (Dollars 8.16), while Isetan lost 16.8 per cent to
Y1,980.
During the boom days of the late 1980s, Shuwa accumulated shares in a range
of Japanese retailers for the claimed purpose of restructuring the industry.
However, the company used several of its share stakes as collateral on loans
from a leading supermarket operator, Daiei.
Daiei, which now faces its own problems following diversification into
credit service, real estate and tourism, is pressuring Shuwa to repay its
debts.
Shuwa, which has total outstanding debts of Y850bn, is expected to release
17.2 per cent of Matsuzakaya shares next month, raising some Y27bn.
Efforts by Shuwa to raise cash through stock sales could trigger
consolidation within the industry through an increase in mergers and
acquisitions.
Shuwa has attempted to sell its 29 per cent stake in Isetan, which has a
network of 10 stores in Japan, to Ito-Yokado, which owns Southland, the US
operator of the Seven Eleven convenience store chain.
Ito-Yokado yesterday said talks over the acquisition of Isetan shares from
Shuwa had fallen through, but it was still interested in adding a department
store to its group.

FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mediocredito banks on new look -
Robert Graham examines the Italian state entity's expanded brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDIOCREDITO Centrale has become the latest Italian state entity to begin
the process of transformation into a joint stock company.
But at a time when the Amato government is seeking to radically cut back the
state's dominant role in banking, Mediocredito, which specialises in credit
for small and medium-size businesses and export finance, will remain firmly
in the public sector.
The new-look Mediocredito has a strong capital base, and with its expanded
brief is likely to become a prominent player not only in Italian banking but
also on the international scene, especially raising funds on the money
markets.
Traditional activities in export finance and funding small and medium-size
companies will be subject to greater transparency. At the same time,
Mediocredito is expected to diversify more, developing its merchant banking
business, beginning project finance at home and abroad and marketing new
financial products, as well as playing a part in underwriting the huge
privatisation programme envisaged by the government.
The board approved the new statutes a month ago for the joint stock company,
giving it net worth of L2,181bn (Dollars 1,581m) and L1,906bn capital. The
capital essentially derives from the entity's previous endowment fund which
came from direct state contributions.
The board itself, headed by Mr Gianfranco Imperatori, which prepared the
change during the course of the year, will remain unchanged. It is now up to
the Bank of Italy to given final endorsement to Mediocredito's new status
Initially, the Treasury will hold all the 190.6m shares with a nominal value
of L10,000 but only 95.3m shares will be issued. All Mediocredito's previous
obligations will be guaranteed by the Treasury and transfered to the new
joint stock company.
According to Mediocredito's projections, it anticipates a net profit of
L47bn next year against an estimated L15bn in 1992. Over the next four
years, it expects the use of resources to grow on average by more than 12
per cent per annum.
Mediocredito is an odd hybrid - part state agency, part medium-term lending
institution. In its latter capacity, it provided subsidised credit to banks
helping small and medium-size businesses finance modernisation, technical
innovation and expansion.
Further, it distributed funds coming from the European Investment Bank and
used its state ownership to raise funds at the most competitive rates, which
were in turn used by a network of regional state-controlled medium-term
lending institutions - the Mediocredito Regionali. In tandem, it sought to
promote the internationalisation of Italian industry through export credit,
development assistance funding and joint ventures.
In 1991, Mediocredito's financing of small and medium-sized enterprises
amounted to L2,179bn. This mainly consisted of refinancing capital
investments, management of guarantee funds and the subsidy of finance to
acquire or lease plant and machinery. While maintaining this side of the
business - and ensuring it complies with EC competition policy rules -
Mediocredito's management wants to take the initiative in easing the heavy
burden of debt among small and medium-sized enterprises. At present, some 65
per cent of their debt is at crippling short term rates. The aim is to
provide refinancing packages which encourage both the acquisition of new
technology, better management techniques and mergers.
On the merchant banking side, it can now acquire stakes in financial groups
and companies with 'public interest purposes'. Through its subsidiaries,
Sofipa and Lombardia Fincapital, it can promote risk capital ventures.
All these latter activities as well as direct export credit financing, are
regarded as non-agency work. As agent for the state, Mediocredito subsidises
interest payments on loans used to finance Italian export supply contracts
in non-EC countries. Last year this activity amounted to L5,327bn.
In parallel, Mediocredito has since 1987 managed a special fund to finance
development aid and assist Italian companies in developing country joint
ventures. Such joint ventures must assist the host country's use of
resources and improve the balance of payments. Italian companies for their
part must, as a rule, put up 50 per cent of the risk capital. In 1991, this
activity amounted to L9,694bn covering ventures especially in Egypt but also
in Argentina and Brazil.
This is an area Mediocredito is anxious to expand along with greater
assistance in the funding of market studies, promotion of export
opportunities and aid to overseas sales offices. Mediocredito sees itself as
a catalyst in encouraging more small and medium-sized companies to look
abroad for market opportunities.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: PizzaExpress ready for the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PIZZAEXPRESS, the pizza restaurant chain founded by Mr Peter Boizot, is
coming to market through a reverse takeover by Star Computer Group.
As expected, Star Computer, the shares of which were suspended at 47p just
before Christmas, plans to acquire PizzaExpress and G&amp;F Group, its largest
franchisee, in a cash, shares and loan note deal worth a total of Pounds
14.63m. The acquisitions are subject to shareholder approval.
The deal, which includes Pounds 11.24m for PizzaExpress itself, has already
received an enthusiastic response from institutional shareholders, according
to the brokers to the deal, Greig Middleton. They claimed that a placing of
24.45m new shares at 40p-a-share to raise Pounds 9.8m to help fund the
acquisition had been ten-times oversubscribed.
Under the terms of the deal Pounds 4.54m of the acquisition price will be
satisfied by issuing new shares to the vendors at 40p a share. The cash and
loan note element of the acquisition price will be financed out of the
proceeds of the 24.45m share placing of which 19m shares will take the form
of a vendor placing.
A further Pounds 4.1m will be raised by a 10.3m share 3-for-2 rights issue
undewritten by Hill Samuel. The proceeds will be used to pay expenses and
repay borrowings of the enlarged group which will be renamed PizzaExpress.
Mr Boizot will be chairman of the enlarged group and hold a personal 14.9
per cent equity stake. He and his partners set up the first PizzaExpress
restaurant in London in 1965. Since then the group has become one of the
most popular pizza restaurant chains in the UK, with 13 owned restaurants
and 52 franchised outlets. In the year to June 28 it made an operating
profit from continuing activities of Pounds 1.5m on turnover of Pounds
16.3m.
The G&amp;F Group, which is being acquired for Pounds 3.04m, operates nine
PizzaExpress restaurants and is run by Mr David Page who will become
managing director of the enlarged group. Turnover for 1991 was Pounds 4.72m
and generated operating profits of Pounds 760,000. In the nine months to
September 27 it recorded Pounds 510,000 operating profits on sales of Pounds
3.47m.
On an historic pro forma basis, the enlarged PizzaExpress group, which will
also include Star Computer's operations as a self-contained subsidiary,
generated operating profits on continuing activities of Pounds 2.4m on
Pounds 28.4m sales.
Star Computer, which supplies software and services to specialist markets,
also reported its interim results and a return to profitability yesterday.
The company posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 55,000 (Pounds 240,000 loss) in
the six months to December 31 on turnover of Pounds 3.79m (Pounds 3.47m).

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Unclear outlook after Bass's seasonal cheer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the UK's leading brewer, recorded a general improvement in its beer
and pubs businesses during the Christmas trading period, Mr Ian Prosser,
chairman, said yesterday.
'It is not yet clear whether this improvement will persist through January
and beyond', he told shareholders at the annual meeting.
Over Christmas, Bass recovered most of the beer volume decline of the first
two months. Free trade sales volume was running nearly 5 per cent above the
same period last year and total volumes were only 0.5 per cent lower.
Mr Prosser, who led a Brewers Society delegation to the Treasury earlier
this week to demand a cut in beer duty, again expressed concern about the
possible impact of increased cross-Channel imports if the government did not
make some move towards duty harmonisation.
A new system of duty collection to be introduced in June would cost the
company Pounds 10m in a full year, he said.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: GWR AGM evicts Pena representative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GENERALLY soft-spoken Mr Howard Wolf finally lost his temper yesterday.
In tones aimed at deafening any objection, the chairman of USM-quoted Great
Western Resources ordered the elegant young woman from his sight.
'You are out of here]' he thundered. 'I am telling you, you are not going to
run these proceedings.'
Mr Wolf, a mild mannered Texan lawyer, might be forgiven for losing control
at Great Western's annual meeting. The lady in question represented
interests of Mr Dan Pena, who has unceasingly plagued Mr Wolf since he took
over chairmanship of GWR in 1991.
Mr Pena, the previous chairman, who still retains 10m shares, is suing the
company for alleged wrongful dismissal. He said yesterday that he would
lodge a complaint with the Stock Exchange over the eviction of his
representative.
No doubt she had hoped to raise questions concerning a statement by GWR this
week on directors' share transactions.
In it, GWR apologised for omitting to notify investors that a verbal
agreement by Mr Gary Loveless, chief executive, to buy 1m shares had been
aborted.
'It could be argued that it wasn't a wise thing for a director to do,' said
one shareholder, 'but the statement was fairly detailed.'
Mr Wolf also told the brief meeting that 1993 was a year of transition. GWR,
which last year resolved its drawn-out dispute with a US public utility and
renegotiated bank facilities, could look forward to significant benefits
from the resurrected coal and oil and gas businesses.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Life business rise at Sun Alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUN ALLIANCE, the insurance group, announc-ed increased new UK life business
for 1992 yesterday. Total annual premiums fell slightly, from Pounds 75.5m
to Pounds 74.9m, while single premiums increased by 71 per cent to Pounds
556m.
Annual premiums were harmed by a fall in mortgage-related endowment sales,
from Pounds 19.78m to Pounds 16.47m, while single premiums were boosted by
sales of pension annuities, which more than doubled from Pounds 109.3m to
Pounds 288.3m.
Business outside the UK was helped by the depreciation in sterling, and rose
from Pounds 75m to Pounds 113m. This included a rise in annual premiums from
Pounds 39m to Pounds 54m.
London and Manchester Group, the life assurance group, announced a 2 per
cent increase in new life business for 1992.
Annual premiums fell, in line with the industry trend, by 18 per cent to
Pounds 41.3m, while single premiums increased by 92 per cent to Pounds
220.3m.
The company attributed the poor annual premiums figure to a significant
reduction in the life broker division network, and said rising unemployment
was 'likely to limit the prospects for immediate recovery in 1993'.
Growth in single premiums came mainly from personal pensions and transfers
from company schemes.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Sharp decline to Pounds 0.4m at London &amp;
Clydeside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP reductions in profits from house building and commercial property
development has left London &amp; Clydeside, the USM-quoted Scottish concern,
with only Pounds 404,000 profit before tax and the final dividend is halved.
The profit, for the 12 months to September 30 1992, plummeted from Pounds
1.82m previously. The final dividend is cut to 2.7p (5.2p), reducing the
total from 7p to 4.5p. That was uncovered by earnings per share of 2.9p
(14.9p).
Mr Norman Chalmers, chairman, said: 'We can't see any secure upturn in the
housing market.' He expected the outcome for the first half of the current
year to be similar to last year, when there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds
120,000.
There was some question of whether the interim dividend would be maintained
at 1.8p. However, 'we hope at least to hold the total'.
Operating profit fell to Pounds 1.98m (Pounds 3.36m) on turnover of Pounds
22m (Pounds 21.4m). House-building made about Pounds 18m sales, but profits
were Pounds 600,000 down.
Mr John McIntyre, managing director, said two up-market sites increased the
average price to Pounds 79,000 (Pounds 75,000). But volume was about 10 per
cent down. Newer ranges included terraced houses at less than Pounds 40,000
each, which it was hoped would push up unit sales.
Development profit fell from Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 200,000. The sale of
one building to a government department had been delayed, although it was
hoped it would come through this year.
Rental income from the Pounds 4.5m property portfolio remained flat at about
Pounds 450,000.
Gearing edged up to 100 per cent on net debt of Pounds 11m.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Christmas boost for London Scottish
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RISE in the number of families ensuring they would have a Christmas turkey
with trimmings despite the recession, helped push up pre-tax profits of
London Scottish Bank, the consumer loans and debt collection group, by 23.5
per cent.
The bank made a surplus of Pounds 3.85m in the year ended October 27 1992,
compared with Pounds 3.11m, despite a Pounds 200,000 increase in its bad
debt charge to Pounds 2.3m.
Income from Christmas hampers grew 33 per cent to Pounds 1.16m, and
commission from debt collection rose 26 per cent to Pounds 5.51m.
Mr Jack Livingstone, chairman, said the increase in hamper sales reflected a
marketing drive, and the fact that customers wanted to make sure of their
Christmas lunch.
'People feel the need for security in a recession,' he said.
Consumers buy hampers by making weekly contributions to a collector from the
start of the year. The business was originally concentrated around
Manchester and Leeds, but has been spread to other areas.
Mr Livingstone said the growth in revenue from hampers and debt collection
had helped to balance a static level of income from consumer loans, which
slipped from Pounds 19.07m to Pounds 18.96m.
He said the bank had raised profits despite the poor consumer loans market
because it could switch its 800 employees to businesses such as debt
collection, which thrived in recession.
Profit before financing the Pounds 37.5m net loan portfolio rose 8.5 per
cent to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5.9m).
Finance costs fell to Pounds 2.62m (Pounds 2.84m), helped by the fall in
base rates, and higher hedging of borrowings.
Earnings per share worked through at 5p (4.7p). The final dividend is 2.05p
for a total of 3p (2.75p).

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Unclear outlook after Bass's seasonal cheer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the UK's leading brewer, recorded a general improvement in its beer
and pubs businesses during the Christmas trading period, Mr Ian Prosser,
chairman, said yesterday.
'It is not yet clear whether this improvement will persist through January
and beyond', he told shareholders at the annual meeting.
Because of the volatility of trading in the October-December quarter, it was
also too early to draw conclusions about the outlook for the year as a
whole.
Over Christmas, Bass recovered most of the beer volume decline of the first
two months. Free trade sales volume was running nearly 5 per cent above the
same period last year and total volumes were only 0.5 per cent lower.
Mr Prosser, who led a Brewers Society delegation to the Treasury earlier
this week to demand a cut in beer duty, again expressed concern about the
possible impact of increased cross-Channel imports if the government did not
make some move towards duty harmonisation.
Beer imported by holidaymakers and cross-Channel shoppers last year
accounted for about 8 per cent of the UK take-home trade, he said.
A new system of duty collection to be introduced in June would cost the
company Pounds 10m in a full year, he added.
Bass sold another 37 pubs to meet the November 1 deadline on its disposal of
2,740 outlets to comply with the government's beer orders. Total disposal
proceeds since July 1989, amounted to nearly Pounds 445m, Mr Prosser said.
Liquor sales in the com-pany's managed pubs were 2 per cent ahead of last
year on a pub-by-pub basis. Food sales had increased, but beer volumes were
1 per cent down.
Holiday Inn occupancies were improving in the US, but room rates had shown
little growth.
The leisure businesses continued to perform solidly.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lower bad debts lift TSB Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB BANK Scotland, an offshoot of the TSB group, increased its annual
pre-tax profits by a little more than 3 per cent in the year to October 31
1992, in what Mr Alastair Dempster, chief executive, called 'a very
difficult economic climate'.
After provisions for bad and doubtful debts down from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds
8.7m, pre-tax profits were Pounds 79.4m (Pounds 76.9m). Operating profit
before the provisions fell slightly from Pounds 91.6m to Pounds 88.2m.
The Edinburgh-based company said revenue suffered from the introduction of
lower margin savings products, necessary to remain competitive. The
cost-income ratio rose from 52.6 per cent to 54.5 per cent because of the
decline in income, although costs were held down.
Mr Dempster said that the bad debt provision was more in line with the
normal level. The 1991 charge had been exceptionally high because of two
large items.
TSB Bank Scotland focuses on lending to individuals and is one of the top
mortgage lenders in Scotland. It also does commercial lending, while new
corporate lending is handled by TSB's Hill Samuel subsidiary. Total assets
rose over the year from Pounds 2.85bn to Pounds 3.5bn.
Mr Dempster was cautiously optimistic about prospects for the coming year.

Colefax &amp; Fowler Group, the upmarket wallpaper, fabric and furnishing group,
fell into the red in the six months to October 31, turning from pre-tax
profits of Pounds 505,000 to losses of Pounds 192,000.
The shares fell 5p to 33p, a far cry from their 180p high in 1989-90 when
pre-tax profits peaked at Pounds 4m.
Mr David Green, chairman, said the period was 'a little gloomy but the worst

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Marketing ploy costs McCarthy up to Pounds
2m
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MARKETING ploy to persuade potential customers to purchase units from
McCarthy &amp; Stone cost the loss-making retirement home builder between Pounds
1.5m and Pounds 2m last year, writes Peggy Hollinger.
The group, which recently reported its third year of deepening losses with a
pre-tax deficit of Pounds 19m, said it had purchased 12 homes from
customers. McCarthy pays the bridging interest for customers unable to sell
their own homes. If the homes are not sold in two years, it agrees to buy
them.
A provision of Pounds 500,000 was made in the accounts, published yesterday,
for any loss on resale of the properties.
The accounts also referred to an unquantified liability in the French
business: 'Homelife sold a number of apartments with a contingent liability
arising in six years time.'

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Slimming down to fit a new niche - ICI's
exit from polypropylene into BASF acrylics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries just keeps on shrinking. In 1989 Britain's
biggest manufacturer had sales of Pounds 13.1bn. By 1991 they were Pounds
12.4bn. Last year analysts estimated that they were Pounds 11.6bn.
Yesterday, ICI continued its slimming programme when it exchanged its
polypropylene business, with turnover of Pounds 135m, for BASF of Germany's
Pounds 60m acrylics operations.
For ICI, the long-awaited exit from polypropylene makes sense. The move is
part of a wider strategy of focusing on businesses in which the group can
compete in Europe, Asia and the US.
The polypropylene business, apart from a small Australian plant which ICI is
retaining, was purely European. And with only 5 per cent of the European
polypropylene market, it was a small fish in a big pond, explains Mr Chris
Hampson, board director and chairman of ICI's chemicals and polymers
division.
An added incentive for ICI is the dire state of the European polypropylene
market. 'This deal gets us out of a business in which we have no future and
which is in a serious loss position,' says Mr Hampson.
Prices for premium injection moulding grades have dropped from DM1,235
(Pounds 508) per tonne in September to DM850 last month.
Mr Paul Ray, at London-based Trichem Consultants, says that for bottom
grades, such as raffia, prices have reached levels which manufacturers find
no longer cover fixed costs, only raw material and variable costs.
The industry is struggling with a massive imbalance between supply and
demand. Companies saw historic demand for polypropylene growing at 6 per
cent a year and started building additional capacity during the late 1980s.
'The market peaked in 1988 when companies could make a decent return,' says
Mr Ray. 'Since then it has been bloody awful.'
The situation is set to deteriorate. Exxon of the US, and the third largest
polypropylene group in Europe, is in the process of bringing on a further
140,000 tonnes in France. Solvay of Belgium is adding 80,000 tonnes, and
Montedisson's subsidiary Himont is expected to add 180,000 tonnes in Italy
this year.
Trichem Consultants expects capacity to increase from 5.31m tonnes last year
to 5.5m this year. European domestic demand last year was only 4.2m tonnes.
BASF concedes that growth in European demand is likely to slow as the German
economy decelerates.
Europe cannot export its way out of trouble. Indeed, European exports are
falling as new capacity comes on stream in Asia.
Exxon reckons that European exports fell by 30 per cent last year, and will
fall from 220,000 tonnes a year in 1990 to zero by 1994.
Mr Bryan Rigby, managing director of BASF north Europe, justifies buying at
such a bleak moment by arguing that strategy cannot give way to short-term
considerations. The deal will give the group critical mass, making it the
second largest polypropylene manufacturer in Europe, with annual capacity of
600,000 tonnes.
'Polypropylene is not an industry for the faint-hearted,' admits Mr Rigby.
'But it is an interesting material, with a wide range of applications. Its
medium-term prospects are bright. The sector has a better than average
future and we will have a better than average position within it. If we
can't make a success of that then we don't deserve to be paid.'
BASF's acquisition is part of a wider restructuring of the market. Last year
Shell and Himont, Europe's leading manufacturer, announced a strategic
alliance in polypropylene. Austria's PCD and Germany's Huls are in
joint-venture negotiations for all their polymer operations.
Consultants believe such mergers will only be effective if capacity is shut
down. However, Mr Rigby says the German group will keep all of its new
capacity.
Meanwhile, ICI is building up its acrylics interests, having picked up Du
Pont's US acrylics operations in a fibres swap last year.
Mr Hampson explains that ICI's acrylics' operations were previously weak on
the continent. Although the company was strong in acrylic monomer (the raw
material for textiles and plastics) it was weak in downstream derivatives.
The acquisition of BASF's two businesses adds such activities.
The acrylics market is growing at between 3 per cent and 5 per cent a year -
more slowly than polypropylene. However, the market is considerably more
fragmented, especially in derivatives.
BASF justifies its exit by explaining that the industry was clearly
consolidating. For example, France's Elf Atochem recently formed a
joint-venture with Rohm and Haas of the US. Mr Rigby believes BASF's
operations were too small to compete in the long term.
Mr Hampson at ICI reckons both companies believe they have concluded a good
exchange. That, he says, is how the best deals are done. Only time will tell
if ICI's diet makes it fitter for the future.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The effect of lower interest rates on its investment income was cited by PWS
Holdings, the Lloyd's insurance and reinsurance broker, as a material factor
behind its reduced results.
The pre-tax figure for the year to September 30 fell from Pounds 2.86m to
Pounds 2.21m on turnover of Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 14.8m).
Trading expenses for the year fell to Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 15.9m). The
reductions accrued from cost control and also from the closure of Fryer
Cheasley.
The final dividend is maintained at 2.5p for an unchanged total of 4p on
earnings per share of 6.7p (9.2p). A scrip alternative is planned.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Shoprite makes placing to raise Pounds 9.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Shoprite, the Isle of Man-based discount food retailer which is
expanding rapidly in Scotland, leapt by 65p to 733p yesterday after it
announced plans to raise Pounds 9.8m through a placing and open offer to
shareholders.
The company is issuing 1.56m shares at 645p each, with the proceeds to be
used to reduce debt and fund further expansion.
The 1-for-9 open offer and placing has been underwritten in full by Credit
Lyonnais Laing.
Shoprite, which also has vehicle retail and property interests on the Isle
of Man, acquired a distribution centre in Glasgow in July 1990. It has since
opened 35 deep-discount food stores in Scotland - 22 of them in the last
financial year.
The group has opened two more stores in Scotland so far this financial year,
with plans for 22 more.
Shoprite's chairman and managing director is Mr Deryck Nicholson, son of Mr
Ken Nicholson, co-founder with Mr Albert Gubay of the Kwik Save discount
chain.
The Nicholson family, which is interested in 60.7 per cent of Shoprite's
existing share capital, has undertaken not to take up its entitlement under
the open offer, amounting to 949,646 new ordinary shares.
Analysts said a number of institutional investors were yesterday chasing the
stock in the market.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Burton Group, the fashion retailer, said yesterday it had a broadly
encouraging Christmas, with sales growth of 14 per cent, although margins
were lower.
Sir John Hoskyns, chairman, told the annual meeting that trading for the
three months to the end of November 1992 was erratic, but sales were up 14
per cent on the previous year, reflecting the group's increased
competitiveness.
Gross margins, however, fell by 2 1/2 percentage points after Burton cut its
mark-up. Sales increases before Christmas were below plan but in promotional
periods like the January sales turnover was above plan.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Law Lords rule on Channel tunnel dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Law Lords yesterday refused to grant Eurotunnel an injunction preventing
Channel tunnel contractors from walking off the Pounds 8bn project unless
they are paid more money.
Transmanche Link, a consortium of five British and five French construction
companies, before Christmas hinted that the opening of the project might be
further delayed if agreement over payments could not be reached.
The opening, originally planned for this May, has been put back until
December because there will be insufficient locomotives and rolling stock to
run a full service until Autumn 1994.
Contractors, in a carefully worded statement in December, reminded
Eurotunnel that it would require 'a strong co-operative effort' if the
project was to be completed speedily.
It was not clear yesterday what bearing the Law Lords' ruling would have on
the contractors' actions given that they could still be sued for substantial
damages if it was proved that they had breached their contract.
The construction companies want Eurotunnel to improve its offer to pay an
additional Pounds 1.2bn, of which Pounds 200m would be paid in some form of
equity such as convertible loan stock.
Eurotunnel asked the courts to grant an injunction in November 1991, after
Transmanche threatened to halt work on installing a cooling system in the
tunnel unless its was paid enough to cover the cost of the work.
Lord Mustill ruled yesterday that the contract between Eurotunnel and
Transmanche already provided a disputes procedure which had yet to be
completed. This did not prohibit the granting of an injunction but the Law
Lords felt this would unfairly disadvantage the contractors as any
arbitration on their claim was unlikely to be resolved until long after the
work had been completed.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Colefax &amp; Fowler falls into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLEFAX &amp; Fowler Group, the upmarket wallpaper, fabric and furnishing group,
fell into the red in the six months to October 31, turning from pre-tax
profits of Pounds 505,000 to losses of Pounds 192,000.
The shares fell 5p to 33p, a far cry from their 180p high in 1989-90 when
pre-tax profits peaked at Pounds 4m.
Mr David Green, chairman, said the period was 'a little gloomy but the worst
is behind us'.
Although there were few signs of a turnround in trading conditions, the
interim losses were said to be no more than a hiccup, and the balance sheet
was strong.
Turnover declined from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 13.9m. Losses per share were
0.76p, against earnings of 2p, and the interim dividend is reduced from 1.3p
to 0.5p.
Sales in the US, responsible for 50 per cent of turnover, had been weak,
although business in December was stronger, and the group's decorating
operations had suffered in particular.
'The UK market is still tough and Europe is not encouraging,' Mr Green said.
Jane Churchill, the mid-price wallpaper and fabric brand, was showing
improved sales, and the devaluation in sterling would help sales on the
Continent and in the US.
However, only renewed confidence in the housing market would restore the
growth, as sales were largely dependent on people redecorating their homes
as they moved house.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Airtours and Owners trade statistics on
holiday sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS and rival holiday tour operator, Owners Abroad, yesterday traded
statistics about the state of their sales for the summer 1993 holiday
season, writes Richard Gourlay.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, told shareholders at the annual
meeting that bookings for summer 1993 and winter 1992-93 were up by 7 per
cent and 17 per cent respectively, year on year.
These figures demonstrate a greater increase in bookings than Airtours
claimed in its offer document sent to Owners a week ago.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners chairman, countered by saying industry surveys
showed his company was continuing to get its pricing right for summer 1993.
According to Stats MR, a respected industry monitor, summer holiday bookings
to the end of December 1992 had fallen by 6 per cent.
While Owners bookings had increased by 19 per cent, Airtours' bookings,
however, had declined by 3 per cent.
Bookings with Thomson, the market leader, fell by 14 per cent.
Figures for the end of November showed that overall bookings fell by 9 per
cent. Owners rose 20 per cent, Airtours' dropped by 6 per cent, and Thomson
fell 21 per cent.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: DTI report clears Suter chairman -
Inspectors strongly criticise David Abell and fellow directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Suter, overshad-owed for five years by the DTI investigation,
yesterday rose 6p to 125p as the report finally seemed to clear Mr David
Abell, chairman, of breaching section 204 of the Companies Act in relation
to concert parties.
However, the implications of the report for Suter are by no means clear cut.
Mr Abell and his non-executive directors are strongly criticised, and
questions are raised about whether Mr Abell is too powerful within the
company.
The inspectors, Mr David Evans and Mr Brian Worth, reserve their strongest
criticisms for the 1986 and 1987 purchase by Mr Abell and Suter of shares in
Metal Closures. The inspectors question Mr Abell's evidence that a
memorandum dated January 7 1987 detailing purchases of shares in Metal
Closures should have been dated January 8, the same day Suter started buying
shares. 'We look upon this memorandum with a great deal of scepticism and
cannot accept it was sent on 8 January 1987,' the report said.
The inspectors said they found Mr Abell's explanations for why he bought
shares in Metal Closures for himself and for Suter 'confusing'. They also
said they found Mr Abell's statements in the memorandum and in later
evidence were 'inconsistent'.
Suter's non-executive directors at the time are strongly criticised,
especially Mr John Rimington, who remains on the Suter board. The inspectors
accused Mr Rimington of ignoring advice from Robert Fleming, Suter's
financial adviser, which advised that Mr Abell should sell his private
shares in Metal Closures for no profit.
'There was no meeting of the non-executive directors and the matter was not
discussed at a board meeting. The minority view of Rimington prevailed
because that was the course desired by Abell,' the report said.
The inspectors said they had been told Mr Abell's investment activities were
not controlled by the board. Mr Abell was therefore able to buy, on behalf
of Suter, up to 15 per cent of another company without main board authority.
'We believe that the non-executive directors failed in their duties to their
shareholders by allowing their assets to be managed in this manner, the
report said.
In the case of James Neill Holdings, in which Mr Abell and Suter bought
shares in 1984, Suter failed to disclose a 5 per cent stake - as the
Companies Act then required - for at least a month after the trigger had
been passed.
With Francis Industries, which Suter acquired in 1984, the inspectors found
no evidence of parties acting in concert. But two share purchases, from
Geneva-registered companies Brolliet and Sterling Trust, are unclear because
these companies refused to divulge the ultimate beneficiaries of the shares.
Other individuals singled out for criticism include Mr Michael
Somerset-Leake, senior partner of Mr Abell's stockbroker CGS, and
controlling shareholder of Winchmore, in which Mr Abell also held a stake.
In the case of Metal Closures, Mr Somerset-Leake is criticised for 'buying
what was tantamount to a personal stake' when he knew Suter was starting to
build a holding.
'As seen in other companies, Somerset-Leake and his clients were avid
members of Abell's 'fan club',' the report claims.
The inspectors recommended laws on concert parties should be tightened up to
cover relationships such as that between Mr Abell and Mr Somerset-Leake,
where no legally binding obligation exists but their actions are similar to
a concert party situation.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: GPA to send debt proposals to banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMAL proposals to reschedule Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600,000) of GPA's Dollars
5bn debt are expected to be sent today to the aircraft leasing company's 100
bank creditors.
The proposals, drafted by the company with the help of its lead bank,
Citicorp of the US, contain details of plans to raise Dollars 200m of new
equity for GPA.
The document will also say that agreement has been reached with aircraft
manufacturers, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industrie, to defer or
cancel orders worth more than Dollars 5bn placed by GPA.
When it began negotiating with banks in the late autumn, GPA had hoped to
agree the rescheduling by the middle of January. The group's leading bankers
said yesterday that they were now hoping for agreement by the end of
February.
'The process is very much on the rails,' said a banker. There had been no
serious hitches, but agreement had to be reached with so many different
institutions that the process had taken longer than expected.
He added that GPA hoped to raise the new equity from existing shareholders
and other investors within 90 days of the banks reaching agreement on the
debt rescheduling.
Nomura, the Japanese securities house, would be asked to play a leading role
in raising the equity, the banker said, despite the failure of last year's
attempts led by Nomura to raise equity for GPA.
Bankers would have been unwilling to reschedule GPA's debt, without a
reduction in its commitments to aircraft manufacturers.
The company faced a cash flow crisis because of its commitments to buy
aeroplanes at a time when it is difficult to persuade airlines to lease
them, due to the worldwide recession.
Bankers said GPA faced the greatest difficulties persuading McDonnell
Douglas to agree to change its contracts.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Roger Shute buys 4.4% of GM Firth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROGER Shute, whose illness-related departure from BM Group sparked the
collapse of its share price last summer, has bought a 4.4 per cent stake in
GM Firth, the steel company.
The news prompted a sharp rise in Firth's share price from 10p to 14 1/2 p
yesterday.
Mr Shute, who has spent several months recuperating from smoking and
stress-related lung disease, said: 'It's an interesting little company'. He
thought Mr Michael Wilkinson, the chairman and chief executive, was a man to
follow, although the two had never met.
Mr Wilkinson said that Mr Shute would without any doubt be a candidate for a
non-executive directorship. The interim results and news about the
heavily-indebted company's future should be announced in the next two weeks.
In November 1991 Mr Wilkinson bought a 21 per cent stake in Firth from the
then chairman Mr Ian Wasserman, a former aide to Mr Jim Slater. Mr
Wilkinson's brother Howard also joined the board. Neither brother has taken
a salary from Firth and a personal loan of Pounds 350,000 has been made to
the company.
After last autumn's sale of a 23 per cent stake in Arthur Lee for about
Pounds 5.4m, borrowings were cut to less than Pounds 9m and a banking
agreement extended.
Firth lost Pounds 4.86m in 1991-92 and recently emerged from a five-month
strike over manning and working practices.
Mr Shute's only contact with the company so far has been to notify it of his
stake. He has spent about Pounds 130,000 on 1.45m shares. He said that
although he was not contemplating returning to 18-hour days, he would like
to take on two or three non-executive directorships.
He remains president of BM, the industrial holding company which turned over
Pounds 519m last year.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Decline to Pounds 3.25m at Hill &amp; Smith
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THERE is no reason for me to apologise for these results,' said Mr John
Silk, chairman of Hill &amp; Smith Holdings, as he announced a fall in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 4.64m to Pounds 3.25m in the year to September 30.
Mr Michael Sara, managing director of the West Midlands-based steel
fabricator and stockholder, explained that steel stockholding and drop
forging were tough markets for all participants, but that the group had been
buoyed by the motorway barrier and bridge parapet, building products, and
drainage products divisions.
The stockholding division 'made a small loss before interest charges of some
substance', said Mr Sara, adding that industry volumes had fallen by between
10 and 15 per cent in most areas.
The three drop forging operations had been reorganised into one company and
the division had made 'a small loss for the first time'. After the year-end,
he said, it had been hit by the pit closure programme - a lot of mining
equipment is drop-forged.
The other three divisions were profitable, though barriers and parapets,
'the backbone' had seen new entrants to its markets.
Mr Sara said that here the group was keen to preserve market share, though
in stockholding margins were more of a priority.
Turnover declined to Pounds 63.1m (Pounds 75.8m), due mainly to the disposal
of Invicta Fencing and Tipton Steel Stockholders (Stoke) - 'items of bad
news', according to Mr Sara.
They had a combined turnover of Pounds 11m. Their sale and 'good stock
control' reduced gearing from 14 to 10.6 per cent.
The group had Pounds 1.2m cash at the year-end and acquisitions were
possible. It bought Duct &amp; Access Covers in March for a maximum Pounds 3.2m.
Earnings worked through at 7.85p (11.17p) per share and the final dividend
is held at 3.9p for a maintained total of 6p.

FT  22 JAN 93 / DTI concludes investigation into Suter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DTI investigation into share dealings by conglomerate Suter and its
chairman Mr David Abell has found no evidence that these and other parties
acted in concert, but has strongly criticised Mr Abell and several
associates.
The 147-page report calls into doubt some of Mr Abell's evidence, describing
it as 'inconsistent' or seeking 'to mislead'. The report also questions the
timing of private share purchases by Mr Abell in Suter's potential bid
targets, and accused Suter's non-executive directors of failing in their
duty to shareholders.
However, the DTI - which ordered the report in July 1988 - said no further
action would be taken. 'There are not sufficient grounds to take action as a
result of this report,' it said.
The DTI also declined to comment on a separate investigation into insider
dealing. Suter confirmed yesterday it knew such an investigation had taken
place but because of DTI rules on confidentiality, the outcome of the
investigation is not known.
The concert party investigation stemmed from a Channel 4 programme in
December 1987 which alleged Mr Abell and connected individuals acted in
concert in taking stakes in a number of companies in the mid 1980s, when
Suter was growing rapidly through acquisitions. Mr Abell is suing Channel 4
for libel over the allegations, which he denies.
The six companies studied by the inspectors included Metal Closures, an
industrial holding company in which Suter built up a 21.3 per cent stake,
and James Neill Holdings, a toolmaker.
The inspectors found no evidence in any of the cases of parties acting in
concert, although they brought attention to the close relationship between
Mr Abell, his stockbroker Coni Gilbert and Sankey (CGS) and other
individuals, described as the 'David Abell fan club', who followed Mr
Abell's business ventures and occasional tips. 'We do not consider there to
be evidence to suggest this fan club overstepped the mark and became a
concert party,' the report said.
But the inspectors express severe reservations about Mr Abell's actions in
the Metal Closures case. Mr Abell acquired 100,000 shares in this company,
the final purchase being made on 8 January 1987. Later on the same day, Mr
Abell authorised the purchase on behalf of Suter of 350,000 Metal Closures
shares.
Suter was told by its financial adviser Robert Fleming that the shares held
by Mr Abell should be sold at no profit to him. This advice was rejected by
the Suter board, however, and the shares were sold at a profit of about
Pounds 23,500.
The inspectors further allege the shares were sold, by CGS, to a 'friendly'
pension fund manager, Textilose Pension Fund Trustees.
Suter welcomed the publication of the report yesterday. But Mr Nigel
Blyth-Tinker, company secretary, said the inspectors made 'a number of
errors'.

<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, and BASF, the
German chemicals giant, yesterday swapped their European polypropylene and
acrylics businesses, as the restructuring of Europe's petrochemicals
industry continued.
The move follows last year's strategic alliance which gave Himont of Italy,
Europe's largest supplier, and Shell, the Anglo-Dutch group, 30 per cent of
the European polypropylene market.
BASF is acquiring ICI's Pounds 135m turnover polypropylene business. In
exchange the German group is selling ICI its Pounds 60m continental acrylics
operations. ICI will also receive a consideration from BASF after due
diligence has been completed. The British company is expected to receive
between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m. ICI's shares closed up 26p at Pounds
11.23.
The deals allow ICI to exit from its loss-making European polypropylene
business. The group controlled only 5 per cent of the European market which
has been suffering from overcapacity and falling prices.
BASF gains two polypropylene plants, one in Wilton on Teesside, the other at
Rozenburg in the Netherlands, with a combined annual capacity of 300,000
tonnes. It becomes Europe's second largest polypropylene supplier with a
capacity of 600,000 tonnes a year. About 530 ICI employees will transfer to
BASF upon completion.
The British group acquires three acrylic derivatives plants, two at Mainz in
Germany and one at Barcelona in Spain. The company is building up its
acrylics operations. Last year it swapped its fibres business for Du Pont's
US acrylics plants.
ICI said the BASF swap, which is due to be completed by the middle of this
year, requires clearance from UK, Spanish, German and possibly Dutch
competition authorities. The company said the deals would not affect US
regulatory clearance for the Du Pont acquisition which is still outstanding.
Mr John Newbold, district secretary of the Transport and General Workers
Union, the main union at ICI's Teesside plants, said the only 'saving grace'
was that the deal was with BASF, whose performance at the former Monsanto
plant it now owns at Seal Sands, Teesside, had impressed the union.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Growing taste for alliances in the food industry: The trend
for joint ventures making worldwide products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT a concert last year Mr Floris Maljers, co-chairman of Unilever, the
Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, and Mr Antoine Riboud, chairman of BSN,
France's largest food manufacturer, fell to chatting about their companies'
operations. As they talked, both men began to see opportunities to do
business together.
That chance conversation bore fruit this week when the companies announced a
joint venture to make and market worldwide products which combine ice cream,
in which Unilever is world leader, with yoghurt, of which BSN is the biggest
producer.
Until recently, such collaboration would have been anathema in an industry
where big manufacturers have long sought full control over their businesses.
Most have resorted to collaboration only on a limited, ad hoc basis to help
them enter difficult markets, such as developing countries.
However, since the end of the 1980s, the industry's taste for strategic
alliances and joint ventures has grown steadily on both sides of the
Atlantic. As the table shows, every year has seen at least one big deal.
All these alliances aim to develop sizeable international businesses
offering rapid growth, often in embryonic markets. Nestle and Coca-Cola, for
instance, are collaborating to distribute canned hot drinks through vending
machines, a business largely unknown outside Japan.
The trend owes much to the stagnation of traditional food markets in
industrialised countries. 'To keep growing, companies need to develop
higher-margin products which respond to new tastes and fashions,' says Mr
John Campbell, food industry analyst with County NatWest.
These pressures have intensified the search for short cuts to faster
innovation, lower costs and to enable new products to be launched on several
world markets at once. As Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman of Nestle, says:
'Nowadays, the quick devour the slow.'
Mr Maljers says Unilever could have developed its own yoghurt technology,
but that would have probably taken three years and much management time.
Another option was to buy a successful medium-sized yoghurt maker, but none
was available.
Indeed, strategic alliances partly reflect diminishing acquisition
opportunities, following a wave of international mergers which began in the
mid-1980s. 'Quite a lot of good targets have already gone,' says Mr Maljers.
Most alliances to date combine complementary skills and assets. Nestle's
deal with Coca-Cola, for instance, marries the former's strengths in soluble
coffee and tea with the latter's powerful international distribution and
vending machine networks.
In Cereal Partners Worldwide, the roles are reversed. General Mills of the
US contributes its extensive know-how in breakfast cereals - which Nestle
says it would have needed 20 years to match - while the Swiss company
provides distribution and merchandising.
General Mills' snacks venture with PepsiCo is slightly different, aiming to
achieve scale economies by merging two rival established businesses.
Nonetheless, General Mills' greater strength in northern Europe is matched
by PepsiCo's in the south.
Another key ingredient is a clear identity of interest between alliance
partners. Mr Maucher stresses the importance of good 'chemistry' in their
relations, while Mr Maljers says: 'The companies must have generally similar
attitudes to the consumer, quality, retailing, distribution and service.
There can be no compromise on any of these points.'
However, the structure of individual partnerships varies. While operating
responsibility in some is equally shared or entrusted to independent
management, in others one partner is clearly predominant. Unilever and
PepsiCo, for instance, are clearly in the driving seat in their respective
ventures with BSN and General Mills.
It is still too soon to judge how far hopes for strategic alliances will be
justified by results. Cereal Partners, one of the earliest, aims for Dollars
1bn (Pounds 600m) in sales by the end of the decade and has built annual
sales of Dollars 200m after only two years. But big profits will take
longer.
Industry leaders are also cautious about predicting how fast the trend will
spread. Mr Maljers admits he has yet to think through many of the
longer-term issues involved, while Mr Maucher warns against euphoria about
what strategic alliances can achieve.
He warns that getting the right fit between companies is not easy, and that
alliances are vulnerable to changes in the ownership or corporate objectives
of the partners involved.
A further obstacle could be posed by anti-trust authorities in Washington
and Brussels - though none of the deals so far has encountered regulatory
objections.
Against that, Mr Maljers argues that successful joint ventures stand a good
chance of surviving over the long term - not least because dissolving them
could create 'horrendous problems' over which partner would be entitled to
ownership of the brands involved.
Meanwhile, he is pondering the next steps, and is particularly intrigued by
the possibility of forming alliances with Japanese companies.
These could widen both Unilever's access to the Japanese market and its
product range by extending it, for instance, to Japanese noodles.
However, he is also acutely aware that similar initiatives by western
companies in other industries have ended in disappointment: 'The big
question is, is it conceivable that this kind of arrangement with the
Japanese can be made to work?'

FT  22 JAN 93 / Albert Fisher in Pounds 29m agreed cash offer for Hunter
Saphir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBERT FISHER, the food processing and distribution group, yesterday made an
agreed cash offer worth Pounds 29.3m for Hunter Saphir, the fresh produce,
herbs and spice company which has seen its share price collapse since 1989.
It is the first acquisition by Albert Fisher since Mr Stephen Walls replaced
Mr Tony Millar as chairman in July. Mr Millar built Albert Fisher by
acquisition into one of the stock market stars of the 1980s, but stepped
down after a profits warning caused the share price to drop sharply.
Mr Walls said Hunter Saphir's fresh produce business would make the enlarged
group one of the leading suppliers to big retailers such as Tesco and Marks
and Spencer. Hunter Saphir also had good links with growers in South Africa
and Israel, whereas Albert Fisher had been too focused on South America and
southern Europe.
Mr Nicholas Saphir, chairman and chief executive of Hunter Saphir, will join
the board as head of a combined European fresh produce division.
Albert Fisher is likely to sell Hunter Saphir's new British Pepper and Spice
factory in Northampton and is already aware of significant third-party
interest in acquiring it. The factory was rebuilt after a fire in 1989, but
has since suffered from a loss of customers and overcapacity.
Hunter Saphir's shares, which have fallen from a peak of 173p in 1989, have
also been hit by the group's unsuccessful foray into the popcorn market,
which ended last week with its disposal at a loss of Butterkist, the toffee
popcorn manufacturer.
The offer is 42p for Hunter Saphir ordinary shares, which were suspended at
36p on Wednesday, and 100p for the preference shares. Albert Fisher's shares
were unchanged at 69p. The purchaser will also assume about Pounds 10m of
debt.
The offer has already been irrevocably accepted by shareholders who control
34.1 per cent of Hunter Saphir's ordinary shares and 81.1 per cent of both
the A and B classes of preference share. Those accepting include Berisford
International, the commodities and property group, which owns 19.8 per cent
of the ordinary shares and all of another class of preference shares.
Schroders is acting for Albert Fisher, while Hunter Saphir is being advised
by NM Rothschild.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Nippon Steel buys chip maker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NIPPON Steel, the world's largest steelmaker, is close to acquiring a 60 per
cent stake in NMB Semiconductor, an ailing Japanese electronics company, in
a deal that highlights the extensive restructuring under way in Japan's
manufacturing industry.
The steel company confirmed negotiations with Minebea, the world's leading
maker of miniature bearings, which founded NMBS in 1984 and still holds 60
per cent. The deal is estimated to be worth Y30bn (Dollars 240m). NMBS is
listed on Tokyo's over-the-counter market.
The Japan Securities Dealers' Association suggested that yesterday it will
investigate recent trading patterns in NMBS shares, which have risen from
Y425,000 to Y958,000 since December 22 on volumes 40 times larger than in
early December. Trading in the shares was suspended yesterday.
NMBS is a maker of memory chips, which have suffered sharp falls in price
over the past two years in an increasingly competitive international market.
It reported a loss of Y12.4bn in the year ended September and forecast a
loss of Y4bn this year.
Minebea has transferred managers to the company and pumped in fresh funds
over the past few years, but the bearings maker has been badly bruised by
the collapse of stock prices and the failure of several diversification
projects. Last year, Minebea reported a consolidated loss of Y13.6bn.
For Nippon Steel, the acquisition of NMBS would broaden its electronics
expertise after initial failure in producing personal computers.
Several other Japanese steel makers, including Kawasaki Steel, Kobe Steel
and NKK, have begun semiconductor production, but the projects, until now,
have been generally unsuccessful. Another struggling Japanese chip maker,
Oki Electric, is reviewing production plans.
There were reports in the Japanese press last year that Intel, the US
electronics maker, which has a partnership with NMBS in the production of
flash memory chips, was negotiating with Minebea, but the US company said
yesterday it is not bidding.
Nippon Steel suggested that a new partnership may be formed with another
Japanese electronics company, such as Hitachi, to ensure the revival of
NMBS.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Lloyd's forecast to post Pounds 2.5bn loss for 1990 and 1991
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London will report losses of at least Pounds 2.5bn over the next
two years, according to a forecast released yesterday by Chatset, the
research company which monitors developments at the insurance market.
The projections for 1990 and 1991 results - which Lloyd's reports three
years in arrears - are significantly worse than earlier forecasts. They
would bring cumulative losses at Lloyd's in the four years to 1991 to more
than Pounds 5bn, further straining the market's capital base, provided by
20,000 individuals or Names.
More than 10,000 Names have left Lloyd's since 1989, while attempts by
loss-making Names to obtain compensation have led to a tangle of legal
actions, with attendant publicity denting the market's image and reputation.
Chatset says losses for 1990, which Lloyd's will report in June, will amount
to Pounds 1.64bn, compared with earlier estimates of Pounds 1.15bn.
The market will still be heavily in the red in 1991, with a deficit of at
least Pounds 1bn. Chatset says its early figures indicate that 1992 'looks
like another loss-making year', partly due to claims of more than Dollars
1bn (Pounds 600m) from hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of Louisiana
and Florida in August.
'Names will have to wait for 1993 possibly to make a profit and 1996 to
receive once again a cheque from Lloyd's,' said Mr John Rew, co-editor of
Chatset.
Explaining the figures, Mr Rew said many syndicates were still receiving
claims from so-called 'spiral' reinsurance business in which Lloyd's
syndicates and companies reinsure each other against catastrophe losses.
These related to losses in 1989, such as hurricane Hugo, and in 1990, such
as the January European storms.
Losses were also arising from asbestosis and pollution claims in the US,
many on policies underwritten up to 30 years ago.
The deficit demonstrated that Lloyd's syndicates had been selling insurance
too cheaply in spite of increasing rates during 1991. The market's 'premium
base was inadequate to meet the volume of claims', said Mr Rew.
The projections could stir controversy among underwriters and agents at the
market, who last year accused Chatset of 'alarmism' when it presented a
similar set of estimates. However, when the 1989 result was announced, it
emerged that Chatset had actually underestimated the size of the loss.
'Last year we were accused of living in cloud cuckoo land. I really wish we
were,' said Mr Rew, who accused Lloyd's of talking up prospects for future
profits.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Brussels truce for breach of EC single market rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has called a truce with Community governments which
break or fail to implement the rules of the new barrier-free single market.
Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC's new internal market commissioner,
yesterday promised a softly-softly approach to infringements of the single
market, which came into force three weeks ago.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi did not specify how long such an 'armistice' would
last, but he said the Commission would monitor the progress of the market
over the first two to three months of 1993.
The announcement provoked a mixed reaction from European business, which is
worried that lax enforcement of nearly 300 single market measures might
undermine the benefits of the market.
'We know it's not easy, but (member states and the Commission) must
implement the single market as soon as possible and not find excuses for not
doing it,' said Mr Rodolphe de Looz Corswarem of Unice, the European
employers' federation.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi, 61, a former Italian diplomat, said he did not want to
provoke a fight with member states. 'I would prefer to have a positive
response (to single market measures), even if it takes a little longer,
rather than a split or a confrontation which would then be more difficult to
solve,' he said.
He added that the January 1 deadline for single market legislation was just
the beginning of a 'first phase' of the single market, which is supposed to
be open to free movement of goods, services, capital and people.
A number of important measures to liberalise and harmonise the EC market
will not take effect until later in the decade, and in some important and
sensitive areas - notably the energy, telecommunications and postal services
sectors - legislation has yet to be approved by member states.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi indicated he would adopt the same lenient approach to
the central outstanding question of how to abolish all passport checks at
internal EC frontiers.
He reaffirmed the Commission's view that EC rules on free movement of people
require the lifting of all internal controls on people and goods. That legal
interpretation has put Brussels in conflict with three member states -
Britain, Denmark and Ireland. They are likely to retain some form of
passport checks even if other continental member states abolish controls.
Mr Vanni d'Archirafi also indicated that the Commission might revive
proposals to allow pets to be taken from continental Europe into Britain and
Ireland without quarantine restrictions.
The commissioner's promise of leniency will be appreciated by a number of
countries - not least Italy itself - which are struggling with
implementation of new legislation, in particular the complex new rules on
the monitoring and collection of value added tax. The Commission urged
national authorities before Christmas not to punish companies which
accidentally broke the new VAT and excise rules.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Railways face jungle of rules: Privatisation bill outlines
complex regulation for operators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S railway privatisation bill to be published today threatens
to create a jungle of bureaucracy for would-be private sector operators.
Each company seeking a part in the running of the railway - whether as a
train operator, station lessor or maintenance depot owner - will need a
licence from the new rail regulator.
Once a licence is obtained, all operating agreements between companies - for
example, between a train operator and a maintenance depot owner - will have
to be registered with the regulator. All future changes will also have to be
notified.
The Railways Bill will split British Rail in two, with one body operating
trains and the other owning the tracks. The freight operations will be sold
and the passenger operations will be franchised out.
The long and complex bill, consisting of 131 clauses and 11 schedules in its
final draft, paves the way for the duties of the British Railways Board to
be divided and passed on to a plethora of new and existing bodies.
In addition to the Rail Regulator - a body similar to Ofgas in the gas
industry and Ofwat in the water industry - these will include the
franchising authority, responsible for franchising BR's train services;
Railtrack, which will own the tracks; a BR residuary body operating trains;
the private sector train and station operators; a Joint Industry Body to
regulate through-ticketing; and the Health and Safety Commission to take
charge of safety.
The complexity of the relationships between these bodies is certain to raise
complaints that the government's method of privatisation could create
bureaucratic obstacles to private sector entrants.
Questioned on privatisation at Westminster yesterday, however, Mr John
Major, the prime minister, was defiant, vowing to press on with the
government's sell-off programme supplemented by more contracting-out and
more market testing of functions currently performed by the public sector.
Much of the Railways Bill is concerned with setting up the statutory and
regulatory framework for the privatised railway, but other features include:
The Rail Regulator will protect the interests of freight and passenger train
users and promote the use of the railways 'to the greatest extent the
secretary of state considers economically possible'.
Stringent licensing conditions will be imposed to keep out 'cowboy'
operators, to check new entrants' financial standing and to ensure safety.
Close monitoring of bilateral relationships will aim to prevent track,
train, station or depot owners from colluding to keep out new entrants or
indulging in anti-competitive practices.
No public sector body - including British Rail, London Underground or any of
the metropolitan passenger transport executives - will be allowed to bid for
any franchises.
The government will have broad powers to give cash grants to freight train
operators in an attempt to stem the haemorrhage of freight from rail to
road.
Railtrack will be eligible to receive cash grants towards the cost of
building socially necessary rail infrastructure if the cost cannot be
recaptured through fares. There are surprisingly few references to
passengers and none to the Passenger's Charter, although the government has
said that the charter will stay in force.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is hoping to win royal assent for
the bill by October. If the timetable is met, the Department of Transport
hopes to franchise out the first groups of passenger services in April 1994.

Yesterday's 2 per cent rise in ICI's shares in response to its asset swap
with BASF suggests the market may have become over-sensitive. The deal adds
only Pounds 60m turnover to ICI's acrylics business and little by way of
additional profits. A cash payment of perhaps Pounds 25m will hardly
transform the company's finances. By securing downstream capacity in
continental Europe, ICI furthers its global ambition in acrylics, but
approval from the US regulators for the proposed asset swap with Du Pont
would be of far greater significance in that regard.
On the evidence of third quarter figures, though, it remains touch and go
whether ICI will be able to cover an unchanged dividend with earnings. The
market is inclined to believe the disposal of the loss-making polypropylene
business might just tip the balance in favour of maintaining the pay-out.
Whether ICI should make the de-cision on the basis of such fine arithmetic
is another matter. Regardless of whether the bio-science demerger goes
ahead, some prospect of a sustained earnings recovery will be required to
justify an unchanged dividend.
It is far from clear that European acrylics will contribute much to that.
The outlook is certainly better than in polypropylene - which faces ruinous
over-capacity. But with demand for acrylic products so closely linked to the
building cycle, a big improvement in profits this year seems too much to
hope for.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Like tea, the Opec oil cartel is strongest when it is in hot water. With the
price of crude sliding to levels which cause producers real pain, next
month's Opec meeting may thus be expected to produce substantial quota
reductions. Before that, though, there will be plenty of jockeying for
position. Saudi Arabia seems ready to cut output. Others have yet to agree.
Yet the weak fiscal position of many Opec members provides a strong
imperative to raise oil prices - particularly because most producers cannot
expand output much further. Demand is also flat, with Europe and Japan mired
in recession and relatively mild weather in the US cutting the need for
heating oil. In Europe, the petrochemicals industry also slumped further in
the last quarter of 1992, notably in Germany. With refining and
petrochemical margins under pressure, and a low crude price, the outlook for
oil company revenues is poor.
Without a strong worldwide recovery in 1993, the oil majors will have to
continue cutting costs. Further rounds of head office redundancies are
likely. Capacity cuts in hard-hit areas like petrochemicals may follow. With
the industry moving towards a lower cost base, even those with stronger
balance sheets such as Shell and Exxon are beginning to follow the lead of
hard-pressed BP. Companies may try to earn extra margins where they can -
hence Shell's attempt to edge up UK petrol prices this week. Making price
rises stick in a poor market is another matter.

<TEXT>
There is something perverse about an equity market which reacts positively
to bad economic news in the belief that interest rates are bound to fall.
There is no disguising the disappointment in yesterday's unemployment and
industrial output figures. A particular blow is the accelerating rate of
unemployment growth, but to conclude that this will lead to an early cut in
interest rates looks like wishful thinking. Apart from anything else, a
speedy cut would look like a gesture of desperation on the part of the
authorities.
The government does have some grounds for arguing that the latest figures do
not provide a complete picture. The industrial output data are two months
old and reflect a period when manufacturers were deeply gloomy. Yesterday's
Chambers of Commerce survey was by no means so down-beat, particularly on
exports. Weekly figures for cash in circulation suggest M0 has been growing
quite strongly in January. It would be in character for the government to
defer any interest rate cut until it has seen how January price rises affect
the underlying inflation rate, especially since the December outturn of 3.7
per cent was on the high side.
Least impressive of all is the notion that a rate cut might be on the way to
help make next week's Pounds 2.5bn gilt auction a success. If a rate cut is
needed for that, the authorities will not stand much of a chance with the
1993-94 borrowing requirement. A rate cut around the budget would both
offset the effect of any fiscal tightening and help get the funding
programme under way. The intervening period may well prove frustrating, both
for the economy and for financial markets.

FT  22 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: BA's turbulent flight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The outcome of British Airways' board meeting yesterday raises two
contentious issues of control. The first is whether the reckless elements
who instigated the dirty tricks campaign against Virgin will be brought
under control by the establishment of a supervisory committee and code of
conduct. The second is to what extent BA can make its influence felt on
USAir following its revised Dollars 300m investment in the ailing American
carrier. There is scope for doubt on both fronts.
Yesterday's apologetic rhetoric suggests the company is chastened by the
Virgin affair, but public contrition has been unmatched by effective action
to prevent a recurrence. No one within BA has yet shouldered responsibility
for the campaign. No one has resigned or been replaced. The same
non-executive directors who neglected BA's original sins are now to oversee
the supervisory regime. The new committee is a clear admission of doubt
about the judgment of the top executive managers but it is a minimal
solution, and a weak alternative to the clear separation of the role of
chairman and chief executive. It seems unlikely to allay public unease and
re-establish the credible leadership on which BA critically depends.
The USAir deal has been carefully restructured to avoid the previous
regulatory objections. BA is spending less money, but will enjoy a smaller
operational reward. Fuller benefits depend on liberalisation in the US. BA's
hopes on this score look implausibly optimistic, especially since its
ability to argue its case has been substantially weakened by the Branson
affair.

Amid talk of discord between the Bank of England and the Bundesbank, the Old

pleasure in opening the latest contract on the London international
financial futures exchange - a medium-term German government bond contract.
Germany's authorities are already embarrassed by Liffe's domination of
trading in German Bund futures, despite frenzied efforts by the country's
Deutsche Terminborse futures exchange to win back market share.
George harked back to that fateful September Wednesday - tellingly
describing it as white, not black - pointing out that trading on Liffe that
day had exceeded volume in Chicago, the world centre for futures trading.
'Glad to have been of service,' he said.

President Jimmy Carter didn't suddenly become James E Carter when he stepped
into the White House. So what are we to make of Bill Clinton's decision to
start signing his name as William J Clinton now that he's
commander-in-chief?
Admittedly, he's not the first to brandish his middle initial. James K Polk
started the trend in 1845, and although it has tended to be a rather pompous
Republican habit, there have been some well known initialled Democrats such
as Franklin D Roosevelt and John F Kennedy.
The difference this time is that Clinton appears to feel that now he is
president he needs a more dignified name for signing treaties and such. On
the other hand he still wants to be known as Bill Clinton. All very
confusing. Perhaps WJC will soon trip off the tongue like FDR, JFK and LBJ.
At least he didn't resort to lumping in his original surname, Blythe. That
would have given him the shortened monniker of WJBC, sounding like some
local radio station's call-sign.

After falling out with his partners, PizzaExpress founder Peter Boizot, has

His chain of 70 pizza restaurants is coming to market through a complex
Pounds 14.6m reverse takeover. The punters are said to be fighting for
shares, and he gets to remain chairman, albeit with some rather strong
handcuffs. The deal has established him as perhaps Britain's most successful

No doubt haughtier dining-establishments would sniff at Boizot's success.
But whatever the 63-year-old jazz and hockey-fan might be short of, he

Meanwhile a more immediate question for Britain is who will replace Geoffrey
Fitchew as head of DG 15, which looks after financial institutions and
company law and is the most important part of Vanni d'Archirafi's new
empire.
Brussels bureaucrats are supposed to be impartial, of course, but given the
dangers adverse EC legislation could pose for the City of London's position
as a world financial centre, the UK has always felt it important to have a
Brit in the post.
Hence the concern about the replacement for 53-year-old Fitchew. An old
Treasury hand, he has been recalled to London to head the European
secretariat of the Cabinet Office. It's said the front-runner is the deputy
DG of the internal market directorate, John Mogg. He'd be a sensible choice,
given that his department has been gobbled up by d'Archirafi.

Where Passat failed, will Kriss break through? He is the pet basset hound of
the European Community's new internal market commissioner Raniero Vanni
d'Archirafi, who looks likely to give a renewed lead to the EC's effort to
get Britain and Ireland to lift their stringent quarantine rules on imported
pets.
Passat, on the other hand, became a canine symbol of the force of
Anglo-Irish fears of the spread of rabies when he and his owner Dieter
Rogalla, a German member of the European Parliament, were banned from
crossing the Channel on new year's eve.
Rogalla - who was making a deliberate attempt to test the rules which
advocates of a pure border-free Europe believe needlessly hamper free
movement - was stopped before he and his pet could board the ferry at
Calais.
The turn-back seemed to confirm Brussels officials' suggestions that the
commission had shelved plans for legislation to loosen the quarantine by
such means as 'pet passports' giving animals have a clean bill of health.
But 61-year-old Vanni d'Archirafi, a former Italian ambassador to Spain and
Germany, indicated yesterday that the measure had certainly not been
abandoned.
Although he had never tried to test the rules, Kriss's owner added, it was
perhaps his love of dogs that explained why his country had never offered
him a diplomatic post in Britain.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Personal View: The flaws in central bank freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRYAN HOPKIN and DOUGLAS WASS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The call for an 'independent' Bank of England as the remedy for Britain's
proneness to chronic inflation has become a parrot cry. It deserves more
scrutiny than has so far been accorded it.
The Bank is the UK's central bank, but it performs many functions not
necessarily associated with a central bank: banking supervision, the
management of the government's borrowing programme, the operation of the
government's foreign exchange portfolio, and exchange control (when it
existed), to mention only four. None of these can be regarded as a necessary
responsibility of a central bank, and the independent exercise of them seems
not to be in the minds of those who canvas the idea of independence. It is
the core function of a central bank which is the issue, viz the provision of
short-term liquidity to the banking system when needed at an interest rate
determined by the bank as a deliberate act of policy. The central bank does
not, many would say cannot, determine the money supply growth rate, though
it may be able to influence it through its short-term interest rate
decisions. Nor can it 'ensure the stability of the currency' (pace the
Bundesbank's charter), though it can, through monetary policy (the setting
of short-term interest rates), have some influence on inflation.
But monetary policy is only one of many instruments of policy which have a
bearing on inflation. Government borrowing, taxation, competition policy and
public sector pay all have some part to play in the fight against inflation.
If beating inflation is so important and the politicians cannot be trusted
to give it the priority it deserves, logically we should take out of their
hands not only monetary policy but a range of other policies as well.
The idea exists that monetary policy is different because it is a simple
technical operation with a single clear-cut objective and with
well-understood and reliable techniques of operation. This is a delusion. It
is a matter of great importance for the jobs and standard of living of
millions of people. It does not affect only inflation, nor does it affect
everyone equally. The nature and degree of its effects cannot be free from
doubt and argument.
High inflation in the UK, when it has existed, has not been only or even
mainly the result of lax monetary policy - nor do we believe that monetary
policy has been conducted on terms of which the Bank of England disapproved.
Simply changing the system of control or designated priorities of that
policy would only marginally contribute to reducing inflation, if other
policies were not designed with the same objective. Britain's present policy
of controlling inflation rests in effect on maintaining economic activity
for the time being at a relatively low level. An independent Bank of England
would not remove the central dilemma of that policy - what is to be the
balance between high unemployment and inflation. This sort of decision
should not be handed over to bankers.
But, the argument goes, what about Germany and the US? The US is not a
particularly happy exemplar. Its inflationary record over the past decade
has been significantly inferior to Japan's, and only marginally superior to
that of France, neither of which has more than nominally independent central
banks. The German case is, however, regularly mobilised in support of the
proposal for independence, but in a way which makes no allowance for all the
other factors which have helped that country successfully to fight
inflation. Low inflation has not been only, or even mainly, the work of the
Bundesbank. Germans are aware of the dangers and costs of inflation from two
bitter experiences. The same attitudes which have made them willing to hand
responsibility to the Bundesbank would have ensured relatively low inflation
if their system had been similar to the UK's.
The Maastricht treaty incorporates the idea of an independent European
central bank, and on this ground, if no other, we believe it to be flawed.
It was, of course, the central bankers, via the Delors Committee, who put it
in.

FT  22 JAN 93 / A victim of its own success: The enhanced role of the UN has
raised new questions about its goals and resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not since the first postwar years has the prestige of the United Nations
stood so high in the western world.
When great powers wish to take military action they now justify it by
reference to UN Security Council resolutions. When they wish not to take
military action, the absence of such resolutions is the first argument they
use. When defining the role of their armed forces, western leaders put
peacekeeping high on the list of tasks, and refer to the 'primacy', or the
'invaluable experience' of the UN in this field. When they seek a political
solution to regional conflicts, they almost instinctively write in a UN
role. Some of them even refer cautiously, but without dismissing it out of
hand, to the possibility of placing recalcitrant countries such as Bosnia
and Somalia under long-term UN administration.
Such expectations and demands have thrust the UN into the limelight, but are
also subjecting it to enormous strain. So much so that senior figures in the
Secretariat are beginning to wonder if it is up to the job. That implies a
criticism directed partly at themselves and the bureaucracy they run, but
partly at the Security Council and its permanent members, from whom most of
the demands come. A running theme of such criticism is that the member
states are not giving the UN the resources - financial and human - to do the
job required of it.
The secretary general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, has been struggling with
these problems since he took over a year ago. He began by a restructuring of
the Secretariat itself, drastically reducing the number of under-secretary
generals (USGs) and regrouping the Secretariat's activities in large
departments, each headed by a USG directly answerable to him. Four of these
departments are directly concerned with the security issues which the
western world, at least, regards as the UN's central responsibility.
Mr Jan Eliasson, a Swedish diplomat who worked closely with the late Olof
Palme, notably in his efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war, deals with
humanitarian affairs. Mr Marrack Goulding, formerly British ambassador in
Angola, retains the peacekeeping portfolio he inherited from Sir Brian
Urquhart in 1986. Preventive diplomacy and 'peacemaking' are shared, on a
regional basis, between Mr James Jonah of Sierra Leone, an old UN hand, who
deals with Africa and the Middle East, and Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, once (as
Soviet deputy foreign minister) the main articulator of Mikhail Gorbachev's
vision for the UN and now the UN's own top diplomat for Europe, Asia and the
Americas.
All four are heavily overworked, partly because on any issue of importance
Mr Boutros Ghali insists on dealing with them personally rather than with
their subordinates. But probably the greatest burden falls on Mr Goulding.
Peacekeeping, a concept not mentioned in the UN charter, and indeed largely
invented by the UN during the cold war, has now become ragingly fashionable.
The essence of it is that small, lightly armed military forces are
interposed between the combatants in a war, with the consent of both
parties, as part of a ceasefire agreement: a confidence-building measure,
enabling each side to feel confident that the other will not launch a
surprise attack. The agreement may also call on the military groups to
collect weapons from both sides, and sometimes to undertake temporary
policing or administrative tasks, such as the supervision of elections. Such
forces are understood to be impartial and are not expected to take any part
in fighting; their arms are to be used only in self-defence.
So great has been the demand for peacekeeping forces that the number under
Mr Goulding's command quintupled last year; these forces now number close to
60,000. But his own administrative staff at UN headquarters has increased
only from 10 to 15. They are at once gratified and embarrassed by their
inability to match the large teams of staff officers sent to talk to them
from much larger military bureaucracies, such as Nato and the Pentagon,
which are now keen to get in on the peacekeeping business.
The US has offered Mr Goulding various forms of electronic hardware -
'real-time' communications systems, for instance, and a 24-hour operations
room - which he has so far hesitated to accept, apparently doubting whether
he and his staff have the capacity to manage such sophisticated machinery.
Meanwhile, he works a 14- or 15-hour day, seven days a week, and is visibly
wilting under the strain.
Out of five important UN operations in 1992, four - in Angola, Cambodia,
Somalia and the former Yugoslavia - have either failed or are in serious
trouble, not mainly through technical failures by the peacekeepers but
because of unresolved political problems. Even the one success story, in El
Salvador, now seems threatened by the refusal of President Alfredo Cristiani
to dismiss some officers, including his defence minister, who have been
identified as responsible for atrocities.
Part of the trouble, it seems, is lack of effective liaison between
departments. In Bosnia and Somalia the UN's objectives have been defined as
humanitarian, yet because military forces are involved the main
organisational load falls on Mr Goulding's department. In Angola and
Cambodia the political agreements on which the operation is based are
falling apart; one might think it was the job of Mr Jonah and Mr Petrovsky,
respectively, to prevent this happening, but their departments do not seem
to have been sufficiently involved, or at an early enough stage.
Mr Boutros Ghali himself is believed to be unhappy about the way things are
working, and may soon attempt a further reorganisation. He has certainly
ruffled feathers in the Secretariat by saying repeatedly that until he came
to New York he imagined his own country, Egypt, had the worst bureaucracy in
the world, but now he knows the UN is even worse.
Yet he would be the last person to suggest that the UN's problems are purely
organisational. In his Agenda for Peace report, published last June, he
showed himself aware that there were situations in which traditional
peacekeeping is not enough, and suggested the creation of 'peace-enforcement
units', more heavily armed than traditional peacekeepers and authorised to
use force in cases where 'cease-fires have . . . been agreed but not
complied with'.
Last September, in his first annual report to the General Assembly, he
highlighted the problems that arise when peacekeeping forces have to deal
with 'non-governmental entities or irregular groups', whose shadowy leaders
may sign agreements but either cannot or will not impose compliance on their
followers.
As the UN is drawn into more and more internal conflicts within member
states, these problems are multiplying. Events in Bosnia and Somalia,
especially, have blurred the distinction between peacekeeping and
enforcement, between humanitarian assistance and military confrontation. In
a different way the same has happened in Iraq, where the UN is still trying
to enlist the consent and assistance of President Saddam Hussein's regime in
relief operations aimed at helping people it has identified as victims of
that same regime, and in some cases at mitigating the effects of sanctions
it has itself imposed.
Talking to senior UN officials about Mr Saddam, or about Somali or Bosnian
Serb warlords, one can sense that they are uncertain whether to adopt the
tone of an affronted authority thumping the table, or that of a patient and
neutral 'honest broker'. The latter pose is one that many of them
instinctively adopt, having learnt it during the long years of the cold war
when neutrality was the only attitude that allowed the UN any role at all.
But arguably the former is more in keeping with the charter, and more
appropriate to the role the UN is coming to play in the new world order.
To play that role effectively, the UN needs expanded resources, a more
radically restructured organisation, and above all perhaps a clearer
definition of its various tasks and how they relate to each other. In all
three areas the new US administration, which has advertised its enthusiasm
for the UN, should have an important contribution to make. The challenge to
President Clinton, and to his UN ambassador, Madeleine Albright, is to find
a way of doing that without reinforcing the already widespread view among
non-western member states, and among their nationals in the Secretariat,
that the western powers have turned the UN into nothing more than an
instrument of their own political whims.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Harsh fare for the jobless
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government, poorly ad-vised by civil servants and City economists
steeped in the conventional economic wisdom, miscalculated the length and
depth of recession. It now risks overestimating the speed of recovery.
Yesterday's Treasury statement, pointing out that most independent
forecasters expect a return to growth this year, can hardly have cheered the
60,000 ex-workers who joined the unemployment register last month.
The first priority of the government's new unemployment policy should be to
give the economy another kick quite soon. The Treasury is right to counsel
against interpreting November's 0.5 per cent fall in manufacturing output as
evidence that the recession is still deepening. But the Treasury has been
saying the same thing for months, while the economy remains flat on its
back, with scant evidence to suggest that it is going to get up again soon.
The one piece of good news is the swift fall in the rate of increase of
average earnings. The government now has room to cut interest rates once
more, despite the slight slip in sterling's exchange rate over the past
week. It should do so, assuming, heroically perhaps, that the Treasury can
raise rates once more if earnings start to pick up.
Yet both history and the practices of British wage-bargaining suggest that
cuts in interest rates will do little to push back the flood of lost jobs
that has far exceeded the increase in registered unemployment over the past
year. Unemployment has risen by 1.4m since the recession began, but total
employment has fallen by a fraction short of 2m. This explains why a
shrinking and unprofitable manufacturing sector is now registering rates of
productivity growth in excess of 5 per cent a year.
One reason for this unusually rapid fall in employment by historical
standards is the increased ease with which employers can now shed labour.
But this has been compounded by the willingness of the employed to push for
higher wages at the expense of job cuts. The average earnings of those lucky
enough to keep their jobs have now risen by a shocking 17.1 per cent since
the recession began and by 6 per cent when earnings are adjusted for
inflation.
Excessive wage increases remain the greatest threat to the unemployed, as Mr
Fred Bayliss points out in a recent pamphlet for the Employment Institute.
The government has a responsibility to represent the unemployed by cajoling
employers and unions to keep settlements low and by waving the interest rate
stick if growth in average earnings starts to rise again.
The government should also be planning how to help the newly unemployed
compete when recovery begins. Recent talk of cutting unemployment benefits
or of imposing some form of workfare on people out of work for less than two
years is misguided. The government should, instead, concentrate its help on
subsidising full-time job search, expanding jobs clubs and computerising the
woefully inadequate system for storing job vacancies.
The more difficult challenge for public policy is how to help the very
long-term unemployed, normally young or old men with no educational
qualifications, who have been unemployed since before the recession began
and are likely to remain so when recovery comes. The negligible education of
these men means that they are not attractive to employers except at lower
wages than the unemployed will accept.
These men are the targets of the new enthusiasm for workfare schemes. But
the US experience spins a cautionary tale. Workfare has an understandable
appeal in these days of rights, responsibilities and budget deficits. But
the risk in stopping benefits or replacing them with poorly paid workfare
schemes is that the young unemployed will be driven not into employment but
into the criminal economies of modern cities. A better option may be to
subsidise employment, so closing the gap between what the illegal economy
offers young people and what the market will pay. Subsidising their
employment, in either the private or public sectors, makes more sense than
leaving them to decay.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Bosnia's future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOSNIAN Serbs' acceptance of the constitutional framework for a future
state of Bosnia-Hercegovina hardly justifies premature jubilation. The
statements by Bosnian Serb leaders clearly indicate that the endorsement by
their parliament of the first stage of the peace plan is no more than
skin-deep. They have not abandoned their goal of a separate Serb state, at
least in the long term, in spite of the draft constitution's provision for a
unified, if largely decentralised Bosnian state.
Yet the decision by the Serb assembly was nonetheless a success for the
peace process, conducted with great commitment by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord
Owen. Since the beginning of the year, the mediators have brought round the
same table the leaders of the three warring factions - Serbs, Moslems and
Croats - who had previously refused to meet face-to-face. Their
participation in direct talks suggests that proponents of a diplomatic
solution are gaining some ground.
That is an important development at a time when the negotiators are about to
embark on the hardest part of the peace plan - the controversial map of the
future state's provincial boundaries. This map has been condemned, not least
by the Bosnian Moslems, for underwriting the military gains made by the
Serbs and condoning, in territorial terms, their policy of 'ethnic
cleansing'. Those criticisms, however, are at least partially based on a
misreading of the facts.
Under the plan, the Serbs, who currently occupy some 70 per cent of the
total territory of Bosnia, compared with about 60 per cent before the
conflict, will be allocated no more than 45 per cent in the future. That
represents a greater Serb roll-back than is generally realised. It provides
the basis for a genuine compromise which the Moslems would be well-advised
to consider seriously.
Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's president, will continue to have a vital
influence on the peace negotiations, as he did in putting pressure on Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to accept the constitutional
framework.
There are, of course, good reasons for doubting the sincerity of Mr
Milosevic, a passionate advocate of a greater Serbia. It would be
unrealistic to believe that he has given up the political objectives which
he proclaimed so loudly only a short time ago.
However, economic self-interest may temporarily prove to be a more powerful
motive for Mr Milosevic than political idealism. The pursuit of a costly war
and international sanctions are increasingly undermining Serbia's economy
and the standard of living of its people. That, more than anything else, is
what has driven him to his currently constructive role in the negotiating
process.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Leading Article: BA off course
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S statement from British Airways on the Virgin scandal is quite
unsatisfactory. The board has satisfied itself that none of its members
'implemented or authorised' the dirty tricks campaign. If that means none of
them knew about it, we are left with the picture of a company woefully short
of operational intelligence at board level. In an industry not noted for its
delicacy, BA should already have had an explicit code of conduct. But even
if such a code had been in place, BA could not have policed it.
Where BA goes from here is a question bristling with issues of corporate
governance. Critics of the Cadbury report have argued that to put in
non-executive directors to police the executives is to set the board at each
other's throats. In most cases, this seems an objection worth thinking
about. BA's case suggests otherwise. The implication of yesterday's
statement, after all, is that no management changes are required at any
level. Lord King can see out his twilight months and Sir Colin Marshall will
succeed him as chairman and chief executive.
This seems complacent to the point of absurdity. The board is in dire need
of outside talent, not only to run the business but to correct the
inward-looking and obsessive tendencies of the BA culture. At the very
least, shareholders should insist that Lord King's job be split on his
departure.
It remains possible, of course, that matters will take an uglier turn. BA's
actions were anti-competitive at the least. If official action should
follow, the rules of the game will change. If not, the board should take a
tough line. If Sir Colin were to insist on both jobs or nothing, he would
undoubtedly be hard to replace. But if a company lets itself fall under the
spell of a dominant individual, it has itself to blame when things
eventually go wrong.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Letter: Coal: cabinet tinkering when competition should be
the aim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER CARVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, One of the justifications often advanced by ministers for the
government's privatisation programme was the removal of the various
undertakings' tariffs to a place of safety in the private sector. No longer,
we were told, would cabinets be able to tinker with utilities' prices to
achieve fiscal objectives as they had done in the past.
Politicians should re-read their old speeches before they adopt the
pusillanimous option of subsiding coal through a levy on electricity bills.
The honest approach would be to identify any assistance as a component of
the public sector borrowing requirement.
That would have the added virtue of avoiding an unfair hike in the running
costs of my members' many products to the artificial benefit of the gas
appliance and supply industry.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Letter: Contracting out not affected by judgment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL FORSYTH MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your labour editor has drawn attention ('EC setback for ministers on
contracting-out', January 18) to a recent case in the European Court of
Justice, Rask v ISS Kantineservice A/S. It was suggested that the judgment
in this case means that the EC Acquired Rights Directive applies when a
service is contracted out. In fact the judgment went no further than to
confirm that the directive is capable, in principle, of applying in such
cases. There is nothing new in this. The judgment specifically left it to
the Danish courts to decide, on the facts of the case, whether a transfer of
an undertaking had taken place.
The Rask case therefore makes no difference to the position which has been
long understood, that employees will only have rights under the directive if
the undertaking in which they work has been transferred as a going concern.
If no more than a contract to provide a service has been transferred, the
directive does not apply. The Rask judgment does not therefore have the
effect of applying the directive to contracting out, any more than it
applied in such cases before.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Minister sans frontieres: Bernard Kouchner, head of France's
humanitarian aid, talks to David Buchan and Alice Rawsthorn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government's 53-year-old boy adventurer has done it again.
Earlier this week Mr Bernard Kouchner, France's humanitarian aid minister,
got 33 Bosnian Moslems prisoners freed in exchange for the same number of
Serb prisoners.
Some cynics carped that Mr Kouchner was just on another ego trip, while at
the same time trying to save the face of Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign
minister who had rashly claimed that France would liberate the Bosnian POW
camps by force, and by itself, if necessary.
But in an interview just before he left for Bosnia, Mr Kouchner disclaimed
any such tawdry political calculations. 'People are suffering in the
(Bosnian) camps,' said France's modern-day Scarlet Pimpernel. For him, the
moral obligation is to act, and act speedily. 'Don't wait, don't ask for
clearance - just go,' is still his motto, he says.
Mr Kouchner has proved impulsive in his five years as France's humanitarian
aid minister, just as he was after 1971 when he established Medecins Sans
Frontieres to spirit himself and other crusading French doctors across
frontiers and battlelines into Biafra, Afghanistan, and Vietnam. This
impulsiveness in a noble cause, combining the methods of a Tintin with the
goals of Mother Teresa, has put Mr Kouchner at the top of the French opinion
polls.
He is clear why his brand of emergency aid has struck such a chord. 'It is
direct, palpable . . . perhaps too superficial, but compared to the
hackneyed way politicians describe the world it speaks to people, especially
to the young . . . it seems to be more moral than traditional political
approaches.' Above all, for western youth with dismal economic prospects at
home, it is, says Mr Kouchner, 'a vision, a style, an adventure'.
His method, he concedes, is far more gripping than long-term development
aid, which tends to produce long-term results. He readily admits the need
for 'le follow-up', for development aid, but it requires 'another kind of
courage, perseverance'. He stresses that, in Somalia, he is already turning
over some of his ministry's emergency aid money to development organisations
to revive the economy, once US and French troops have re-established order.
The other ingredient of Kouchnerism is the media. His partner happens to be
Christine Ockrent, the doyenne of the new French breed of bright and
beautiful television executives. Mr Kouchner is anything but camera-shy
himself. Last month he overdid it, wading ashore in Somalia with a bag of
rice on his back for the benefit of the massed cameras.
He has long exploited the power of the small screen to excite compassion.
Indeed, the reason some of his co-founders of Medecins Sans Frontieres
parted company with him was that they thought he was wrapping efforts to
rescue Vietnamese boat people in too much media-hype. He then founded
Medecins du Monde, which has run a poster campaign in France likening Mr
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, to Adolf Hitler, a comparison which
Mr Kouchner finds excessive.
Yet, for Mr Kouchner, 'show-biz' is a vital part of whipping up and
sustaining public support for humanitarian aid. European Community officials
have been irritated at the way the French minister sometimes jets in,
complete with TV camera crew, to take credit wherever EC relief aid is being
delivered. And why not? he retorts. 'After all 23 per cent of all EC aid is
paid for by France,' he says, adding condescendingly: 'I can understand why
the people in Brussels do not know how to sell their aid - they are
bureaucrats.'
Almost as despicable a term, for Mr Kouchner, is the word 'establishment'.
Yet, he has had a big influence on it. He has become the favourite of
President Mitterrand's waning years in office. This is partly because he has
a soulmate in Danielle, the president's wife, with whom he has visited
Kurdish refugees in Iraq. But Mr Mitterrand also sees him as the one bright
spot in a Socialist administration heavily tarnished by scandal. So the
president has increasingly given Mr Kouchner his head.
In sending troops to Somalia last month, the president sided with his aid
minister, and against Mr Pierre Joxe, his defence minister, who argued that
French forces were overstretched already. 'You have to understand Joxe,'
says Mr Kouchner in a fit of post-victory compassion. 'He has to manage all
the troops being called on by the UN. I push, he brakes, that is normal.'
But the upshot is that France now has more troops - over 10,000 - than any
other country in the UN (mainly in Bosnia, Cambodia and Somalia). For Mr
Kouchner, this doctrine of 'humanitarian intervention' has made fantastic
progress. 'We (French doctors) used to be considered boy scouts - now states
intervene under the UN flag.'
A final Kouchner victory came last week with the announcement that future
conscripts could do a 16-month 'humanitarian service' in the third world,
instead of serving their 11 months in the French army. 'I campaigned nine
years for this,' says Mr Kouchner, pointing out that he receives 25,000
requests a year from conscripts asking him for a 'do-good' alternative.
Mr Kouchner is unique among European ministers responsible for humanitarian
aid in that, unlike them, his other charge is not development aid, but the
health ministry. This puts him outside the foreign policy establishment -
and that is where he wants to stay. He refused Prime Minister Pierre
Beregovoy's suggestion last autumn that he should take on the development
aid ministry as well. 'I felt it better to stay with health', as a doctor
among doctors, who 'do not have to take account of frontiers and political
realities'. In any case, he points out, '60 to 70 per cent of humanitarian
aid is carried out around medicine'.
Drab normality may soon reassert itself, if the conservative opposition wins
the March election. 'The right have asked me to stay on,' says Mr Kouchner,
who claims to be 'of the left' but wears no party label and is not standing
for election. He declined. He suspects that a conservative government would
put humanitarian aid back under the control of the Quai d'Orsay.
Furthermore, 'after five years in office, I want to come back for one or two
years to reality and normality'. What does this comprise? 'Hospital work,
sun, humanitarian missions, setting up a foundation, thinking, writing,
looking at women.'
'I might return to politics in time for the presidential election (in
1995).' To stand in his own right for the Elysee? 'No, I intend to stand
beside someone else.' Beside whom, he will not say, except to admit that he
is 'very close' to Mr Michel Rocard, the likely Socialist standard-bearer.
Certainly, a Socialist candidate in 1995 may need all the lustre that
Kouchner can lend.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Here's a thought that may have cros-sed the mind of Britain's prime
minister: there are 2,535 days, or just over 83 months, to go to the turn of
the century. Who will be in the important seats of power then? I can think
of just three incumbent politicians who may reasonably fancy their chances
of holding on until at least January 1 2000. They are: President Bill
Clinton, Mr John Major and, of course, Mr Saddam Hussein.
Very well, strike out the latter. The notion is too depressing. What is
certain is that by the end of this decade France will have a new president,
Germany a new chancellor, Italy a fresh prime minister and the European
Commission a president other than Mr Jacques Delors. Even Spain will
probably have a different head of government.
Most of the above changes are likely to take place within the next two or
three years. That would clear away the present generation of continental
west European leaders - and with it the Kohl-Mitterrand duet. A different
cast would be in place comfortably in advance of the next British general
election, which need not be held until 1996 or 1997. The new US president
and the relatively new British prime minister might, however, sit in their
present chairs until the millennium.
When writing such words you should always keep your fingers crossed, throw a
pinch of salt over your left shoulder, chant a few spells, and pepper the
air with phrases about not tempting fate. It is far too early to start
guessing whether Mr Clinton will win again in 1996. Yet while Wednesday's
inaugural speech may have sounded corny to British ears (it was corny), only
crusty old cynics can fail to have envied the wide-eyed optimism in
Washington. The new president may turn out to be a disaster, but he should
at least be given his first 100 days of grace.
Mr Major is another story. Memories of the mishaps of 1992 are still fresh.
The conventional wisdom is that, one way or another, he will be tripped up
before long. I think not. The prime minister has started the new year in
combative form, as his performance in the House of Commons shows. He seems
revitalised. This is not self-delusion. He faces no challenger today, and
looks set to win in the future. He can hope for a modicum of ec-onomic
recovery in spite of yesterday's increase in unemployment to nearly 3m. He
can rely on the redrawing of constituency boundaries in the Conservatives'
favour. He can reasonably calculate that Labour will fail to renew itself.
Meanwhile, he can work hard in 1993 to regain the authority he lost in 1992.
That is what he is doing. To understand his methods, we must look back. When
he arrived in Number 10 Downing Street just over two years ago, Mr Major was
young, well-liked, and good on television. He would have done well to
celebrate by playing a saxophone and talking of change. Yet he could not
then make Clintonesque speeches about a younger generation. He was disbarred
by political necessity from invoking the spirit of renewal. He was obliged
to speak of continuity, and publicly to honour his predecessor. His first
task was to maintain the unity of the Conservative party.
It remains his first task. The Tory schism over Europe, which destroyed his
predecessor, has almost devoured him. On one crucial Maastricht vote, on
November 4, his majority was reduced to three. He must maintain the delicate
balance achieved on that terrible night until the bill is safely through.
Then he may relax, but just for a moment. If he is prudent he will avoid
talk of rejoining the exchange rate mechanism until after the next election,
in spite of his preference for managed exchange rates. If he is lucky, the
ERM will have im-ploded before he has to make a choice; if he is
ill-starred, all circumstances save the condition of the Conservative party
will be favourable to re-entry.
Meanwhile the debate on the political structure of the new Europe could
change in his favour. A review of the Maastricht treaty is due in 1996. In
theory that could reopen Tory wounds. But Mr Major is taking out insurance
this year. He is preparing papers that envisage a loose
government-to-government structure and an open Europe, stretching from the
Atlantic to the Russian border. When the 1996 inter-governmental conference
comes along, and all the faces except Mr Major's are new, he can try to move
the European Union further along that Thatcherite trail. Call it good
tactics, or call it perfidious Albion. The result is the same.
There is little that the prime minister can do to meet the criticism that he
is not leading us anywhere. He inherited a 13-year-old administration. He
did not create a new one from scratch. He did not have the luxury of a
period of opposition in which to invent new slogans, new strategies, new
constructions of the liberal market economy. Yet all is not lost. 'Placing
Britain at the heart of Europe' has had less of a ring to it since Black
Wednesday, but it may still be serviceable if the European debate moves
along the lines suggested above.
Anyhow, seen from Mr Major's point of view, his government is doing a lot.
The health reforms are bedding down. Far-reaching education reforms are
being put in place, albeit not smoothly. The structure of local government
is being rationalised. (But the establishment of larger units does not
strengthen local government if at the same time its finances are constrained
and its powers over housing, education and possibly the police are removed.)
Contracting out of white-collar civil service jobs is moving ahead. The
prime minister will insist, until the cows come home, that the Citizen's
Charter is improving publicly financed services. His latest initiative,
which will be promoted as a 1990s 'bonfire of controls', is a welcome search
for industrial regulations that can be scrapped. The budget will probably
include supply-side initiatives that can be said to favour manufacturing.
Mr Major has acknowledged that he has not found the words to depict this
collection of programmes, most of which I applaud, as a grand campaign. I
wonder if it would do any good if he did. Mr Clinton could announce without
shame that 'Americans have ever been a restless, questing, hopeful people'.
Are the British?

Sir, Re your article 'The threat to interest relief on mortgages' (January
16) and current speculation on budget requirements prompts me to suggest a
simple approach limiting relief to earlier years of home ownership, namely:
relief to be available only for 10 years after first purchase, (or for five
years after April 1 1993 for existing qualifying mortgages).
future first-time buyers after April 1 1993 to be eligible for relief on
Pounds 40,000; this level to be open for budget revision every four years.
relief to be available on subsequent qualifying house purchases within the
time period defined above, but only at the level initially allowed.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Letter: Dockland heritage enriched, not destroyed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HOWARD SHEPPARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Brian Gill's depiction of London's diminishing built heritage in the
dockland area was misleading in the extreme (Letters, January 14).
Contrary to what he suggests, when the Department of the Environment was
invited in 1981 by the newly created Docklands Development Corporation to
survey every building in its jurisdiction, no buildings of architectural or
historical merit were identified on St George's Wharf, Deptford. However,
115 previously overlooked buildings in the Docklands area were listed,
adding substantially to the existing list compiled in 1973.
Since 1981, further research has shed light on many other buildings and
artefacts which have proved to be of historic or architectural value. The
corporation has wasted no time in having these spot-listed. On St George's
Wharf, for instance, the LDDC has repaired and restored an old brick wall
and parish boundary stone dating from 1819. These were spot-listed in July
of last year.
It was not too long ago that the old dock buildings were being pulled down
and the docks filled in, without any regard to their potential significance.
In the 11 years of the corporation's existence, however, that trend has been
reversed. The preservation and conservation work carried out by the LDDC has
ensured that London's heritage in docklands, far from being destroyed, is
being enriched.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Arts: Homage to Tchaikovsky - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing that I have seen thus far during the Bolshoy's season at the Albert
Hall persuades me that ballet is anything like itself when served up to
audiences on the vast platter of the present stage. Not that dancing cannot
'work' under these surroundings: the Japanese musicians and dancers of the
Gagaku troupe, and Merce Cunningham's Prom appearance a few years ago,
showed how engrossing and absolutely communicative dance can be in this
arena. But neither of these troupes was proscenium-bound: Cunningham has
ever propounded freedom of visual choice for his public; Gagaku is court
ritual and meant to be seen in the round.
Classical choreography, though, is an art in which the creator is centrally
concerned with what his audience must see. Making ballet implies an
editorial function, stressing incident or step so that the audience is given
maximum access to the creator's intentions. (It is a serious problem in
televising and filming ballet when directors seek to show what they think
important, which runs counter to the logic of the dance itself. A series of
hectic films of Balanchine ballets, made in Germany in the 1960s, are
testimony to directorial arrogance, and excruciating as records of the
choreography).
The Bolshoy's Homage to Tchaikovsky programme, which I saw on Wednesday,
comprises acts from the composer's three ballets. The stage conditions made
them seem ceremonies rather than performances, from which one might pick out
certain fascinating elements. I have already reported on the Nutcracker -
with some regret, since the charm of Yury Grigorovich's staging evaporates
into the hall.
The Sleeping Beauty suite offered the last act divertissements preceded by
the peasant waltz, and the effect was as if Petipa's (and Tchaikovsky's)
essence had been massively diluted. The fairy-tale characters came
disconsolately on like the first guests at a costume ball - funereal tempi
adopted for the Bluebirds made this lovely duet seem exhausted - while
Aurora and her Prince (Nadezhda Gracheva and Andrey Uvarov) looked as if
they were plighting their troth on Salisbury Plain. My interest was held,
though, by Uvarov; even under these circumstances, he is a remarkably fine
dancer. Tall, possessed of a strong and elegant technique, he is a true
premier danseur classique - rarest of beings - with that largeness and
harmony of style that only Russian training can give. We have much to expect
from him. As also from Nikolay Tsitskaridze, who soared through the pretty
waltz that tells the story of Cinderella and her prince. Tsitskaridze's
dance is fluent, with beautiful physical manners bringing lustre to the
simplest academic step. It is clear from this season, whatever else may be
unclear, that the Bolshoy has a new generation of gifted young men: Sergey
Filin and Yury Klevtsov are also noteworthy talents.
The second act of Swan Lake, which completed the evening, became a plotless
and dam' near abstract ballet. It was handsome to look at. The Bolshoy women
excite our admiration by the grace of their training, and the lines of swans
were impeccable. Nina Semizorova was a cool and academically admirable
Odette. The effect of so much white costuming and of a pallid back-cloth, of
the faint shadows cast on the stage, was anaemic. I thought of other,
grandly moving Bolshoy Swan Lakes - with Plisetskaya and Bessmertnova, with
Semenyaka, and in a priceless film fragment with the legendary Semyonova
(still coaching, and in London with the company), and I wanted to see the
Bolshoy Ballet in Swan Lake rather than this dutiful visit to the dear
departed's grave.
The Bolshoy Ballet continues at the Royal Albert Hall until Feb 14.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Arts: The Hypochondriac - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few great artists have relied so much upon formula as Moliere. True, when he
made a play like The Misanthrope, he created a protagonist and a dilemma
that are still startling. But in many other plays he gave us age-old plots
that circle around such archetypes as the miserly old pantaloon, the two
young lovers whose love is thwarted by the older generation, the quack
doctor, and so on. We seem to have known these characters all our lives, and
yet Moliere's impishness is such that we hang both on the suspense of the
old plot and on the fun of the detail that makes it new.
Cambridge Theatre Company's new production of The Hypochondriac has Gerard
Murphy both as translator and playing the title role. Here he is,
self-mollycoddled in shawls and kerchiefs, savouring his doctors' bills (for
'a full, penetrative, colonic irrigation . . . a cathartic douche, to dispel
Sir's wind'); I laugh all the more to recall that this time last year I was
watching him as Oedipus, heroic, noble and shattered. As Argan, he looks
like a fretful old pug. Occasionally he applies too much virtuosity of
breathcontrol and vocal colour, but his nervous force is the production's
lynchpin.
His translation catches the lively banter of Moliere's prose. A pity that he
translates 'bagatelles' as 'bullshit.' 'Foul' language blunts the fun of
Argan's fascination with his own bowels. ('Have I excreted much bile?' he
asks tenderly.) Murphy's version also, audaciously, includes the play's
musical prologue, interludes and finale, and brings them off, if not with
musical finesse, at least with comic panache
Although the director, Nick Philippou, had to leave the production in the
last week of rehearsals 'for personal reasons,' the company gives him full
credit. As it stands, this Hypochondriac has plenty of energy, and its
audience is kept laughing aloud from first to last. Some problems arise in
having seven actors play all the roles in a play that already has characters
appearing in disguise; and when Damon Shaw (a tall man) appears as Argan's
little daughter Louison things tip over briefly into the wrong kind of
buffoonery.
As the maid Toinette, Kathy Burke is not your traditional pert chit, but a
loud, broad Eastender with vowels that could bat for England. She never
steps out of character, and she becomes the production's second cornerstone.
Debra Gillett and James Dreyfus, as Argan's daughter Angelique and her lover
Cleante, steer a suave path between sincere ardour and mischievous
exaggeration. The way that he, when pretending to be her singing-master,
hurls veiled hints of his vexation at her family comes close to Fawlty
Towers extremism, but is irresistibly funny. Moggie Douglas's designs
combine economy, stylishness and satire.
On tour until March 6

FT  22 JAN 93 / Arts: Kurt Equiluz - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kurt Equiluz has for many years been a famous exponent of Bach's oratorios
in all the world's important Bach-performing cities. As a Lieder singer he
is much less widely known. Tuesday's recital at the Wigmore Hall was his
first in London - a remarkable and, indeed, memorable debut in more ways
than one. According to the New Grove Dictionary of Opera the Austrian tenor
is only a few months short of his 64th birthday, an unusual age for a singer
to be confronting new audiences; but it seems Mr Equiluz won many admirers
during his recent spell of teaching at the Pears-Britten School in
Aldeburgh, who persuaded him that his wares simply had to be displayed
further afield.
They were absolutely right. Lieder-singing of this kind and quality is
unfamiliar. The kind is perhaps not to every taste. Mr Equiluz's instrument
is extraordinarily well preserved, and used with a skill that affords in
itself a sort of master-class vivant; but it has little flesh left on the
tone, juice in the timbre, and therefore allows him little room for
expansiveness or physical exultancy.
Every line comes out 'light' - but as it is a lightness turned unfailingly
to artistic ends, Mr Equiluz's singing of Schubert, Wolf, Joseph Marx and
Strauss swiftly moves his audience worlds away from the modern mode of
Lieder-listening. He operates with absolute confidence according to the
'less is more' maxim: the slenderness of the sound is allied to the utmost
precision of tonal and verbal shading, to a wonderful charm and delicacy in
every phrase and sentence.
In the opening Schubert songs - 'Liebesbotschaft' and 'Standchen', from the
Schwanengesang - one could almost feel the dimensions of an already intimate
and welcoming performing space shrinking still further around the voice and
the personality. In the best way, the 'domestic' communicative side of
Lieder-singing seemed to be re-awakened. Wolf thus treated, Wolf not dressed
up with bright interpretative lights and expert cosmetic applications, is a
revelation.
True, there were a few songs on the programme (properly requiring a greater
degree of vocal weight and emotional force than Mr Equiluz could summon; and
certainly, the voice was not always treated with the appropriate tact by
Margot Fussi's meaty piano-playing. But altogether this was an experience of
rare and delightful freshness. I could easily imagine Mr Equiluz becoming a
cult figure among London's Lieder-loving public.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Arts: Truth in mosaic - Susan Moore examines the influence
of Tuscany on John Ruskin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fervour and desperation are evident in equal measure at the Accademia
Italiana's Ruskin and Tuscany. Looking around the show's rich mixture of
Ruskin sketches and watercolour studies, his notebooks and letters, the
silvery architectural daguerreotypes, the sepia photographs and the careful
watercolours he commissioned from others, we have an acute sense of a
bedazzled mind in overdrive.
There was not a fragment of masonry, sculpture, fresco - or even plant  -
that failed to engage his attention. 'I am perpetually torn to bits by
conflicting demands on me,' he wrote to his father in 1845. In Lucca he
gloried in 'church fronts charged with heavenly sculpture and inlaid with
whole histories in marble', but in such a parlous state of decay that he
felt obliged to record them. At the Camposanto in Pisa he found that
'everything architectural is tumbling to pieces, and everything artistical
is fading away'. Only rarely was there time to linger beyond the most
cursory of drawings. 'Fragments of everything from a Cupola to a Cartwheel,'
lamented his father, 'all true - truth itself but Truth in mosaic.'
The name of John Ruskin is more frequently associated with Venice, the Alps
and the French cathedral towns than with Florence, Lucca, Pisa and Siena.
Yet Ruskin was to make seven tours to Tuscany between 1840 and 1882. As the
recent research of Jeanne Clegg and Paul Tucker reveals, his understanding
of Tuscan art and culture was to play a central role in the development of
his thought. For Ruskin, Tuscany was the cradle of modern civilisation, the
meeting place of North and South, Greek and Gothic, Christian and infidel.
Whether in his writing or in his lectures, he constantly raised the spectre
of early Renaissance Tuscany. Giotto's Campanile in Florence was 'the model
and mirror of perfect architecture', its carved panels, as he saw it, a
testimony to the sacredness of labour. Jacopo della Quercia's tomb of Ilaria
del Carretto in the Duomo at Lucca became his ideal of Christian sculpture -
a sacred portrait of infinite peace. (His passion for this cool beauty was
woven inextricably in his own mind with his devotion to the ill-fated young
Rose La Touche, who quite sensibly spurned him.)
To illustrate the point that 'Beautiful art can only be produced by people
who have beautiful things around them,' he would confect a romantic
Pre-Raphaelite vision of medieval Pisa to contrast with the squalor of
suburban Rochdale.
Tuscany was also a place of revelation. His 1845 trip, for instance, was
conceived solely to come to grips with the religious art of the early
Italian masters for the second volume of Modern Painters. Struck dumb with
admiration and amazement in the Romanesque nave of San Frediano in Lucca, he
was inspired 'there and then on an instant' to embark on a life-long study
of architecture.
The lion's share of the material on display was conceived or purchased for
educational purposes. It is a dense show on a complex and maddeningly
self-contradictory subject, but show and scholarly catalogue repay close
attention. The only pity is that we cannot hear more of Ruskin's eloquent
prose.
His protege Edward Burne-Jones is represented by a slim offering, a
watercolour copy of a fresco in Santa Croce. John Wharlton Bunney, a former
pupil, proved more helpful, producing reams of painstaking architectural
drawings and watercolours. The American Henry Roderick Newman is revealed to
be a master of the art of reproducing porphyry and marble.
Ruskin's determination to document the region's rapidly disintegrating
heritage never abated, and his last years saw him encouraging others to take
up the cause. In 1886, for example, TM Rooke, a salaried copiest for the
Guild of St George, was instructed to work 'chiefly on things perishing'.
Ruskin made his last Tuscan tour the same year, accompanied by HG
Collingwood, a former pupil. at Old haunts were re-visited and further
dilapidations deplored.
Florence disgusted the ill and weary Ruskin more than ever: 'Everywhere
paviours, masons, ruin - degradation - folly and noise and' - a problem only
too familiar to any later tourist - 'the wretched Germans, English and
Yankees busy upon it like dung-flies.'
Ruskin in Tuscany, sponsored by The Guild of St George with support from the
Henry Moore Foundation, continues at the Accademia Italiana, London, until
February 7. It travels to the Ruskin Gallery, Sheffield, February 20-April
10, and to the Fondazione Ragghianti, Lucca, May 1-June 12

The Grateful Dead are definitely a good thing. This archetypal sixties rock
band has always been known to be generous with its time - they invariably
play for over three hours to their besotted and faithful fans. Now Arena
(BBC 2 at 9.30) reveals that they are equally generous with their money,
establishing the Rex Foundation to help indigent composers. British
composers in the classical tradition like James Dillon and Robert Simpson
are able to keep going thanks to donations from the Dead.
Two contrasting new series appear on Channel 4. In Gardens Without Borders
at 9.00 designer Alan Mason starts a tour of the grandest French gardens
while the return of Absolutely at 10.30 will appeal to comedy lovers
untroubled by a Scottish accent. It is a hit or miss affair, but the frantic
pace disguises many of the no-nos.
For some people Heimat, a 16-hour epic about life in a small German village
between 1919 and 1982, is one of the greatest movies of all time. You can
judge at 11.00, when BBC 2 screens the first, two-hour episode. The reward
for anyone hooked is that director Edgar Reitz's sequel will be shown this
year.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Arts: Boulez conducts in Birmingham - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There can no better confirmation of the arrival of the City of Birmingham
Symphony in the top international flight than Pierre Boulez's acceptance of
an invitation to conduct the orchestra. For Simon Rattle, who has been
largely responsible for the CBSO's present eminence and for whom playing
under Boulez in the National Youth Orchestra 20 years ago was an important
formative experience, it must be an immensely satisfying occasion.
Boulez is spending the best part of two weeks in Birmingham, conducting two
CBSO programmes as well as working with students from the Birmingham
Conservatoire and appearing with the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group.
The programmes of Debussy, Stravinsky, Bartok and the Second Viennese
School, as well as his own Notations, come from the core of Boulez's musical
world. It is all repertory close to Rattle's heart also; at present there
can be few European orchestras better equipped to respond to Boulez than the
CBSO.
Certainly the verve with which he launched the first of Schoenberg's Five
Orchestral Pieces in Symphony Hall on Thursday of last week could only have
been achieved through complete familiarity and technical confidence. The
later, more expressive Boulez emphasises the sinewy lyricism of these pieces
and in the process demonstrates just how important a model they were for
Alban Berg; but that still does not preclude him from balancing the colour
chords of the 'Farben' movement with absolute precision, or marshalling the
counterpoints of 'The endless recitative' with uncompromising directness.
There was Webern in both concerts. In Thursday's the two Cantatas Opp. 31
and 29 framed the orchestral Variations Op. 30 and slightly misfired: an
unannounced change of programme order did not help the audience's
concentration, but there was still something didactic about Boulez's Webern,
however much he gave dramatic life to the choral textures (from the BBC
Singers) in the cantatas or underpinned the soloists (Sarah Leonard and
Robert Hayward, both faultless) with vivid detail. In the Variations there
was still the feeling of emphasising compositional intricacy over expressive
force. The freedom with which Boulez conducts Schoenberg and Berg nowadays
seemed not yet percolated through to their compatriot, yet the second
concert this Wednesday opened with as effective and direct an account of the
Op 1 Passacaglia as could be imagined, built up from the slowest of
beginnings to a fierce, challenging climax.
Petrushka ended the first concert, given as always by Boulez in the original
1911 version with quadruple wind. The CBSO was on top of every bar,
wonderfully pungent in its solos (eloquent flute, piano, clarinets and
trumpets) and exact in its ensemble. Boulez combined rhythmic accuracy with
exquisite refinement - ravishing in the delicate folk counterpoints of the
first tableau and in the lapping impressionist washes of the last, which
seem like the Stravinskyan equivalent of a vamp-till-ready. In the closing
pages every element was made to tell, with no question of anything but the
most acute and searching dramatic sense informing every note.
The second programme was rounded off with a flourish by Notations, a
brilliant orchestral showpiece which has surely become the most performed of
all Boulez's works. There was a sample of his unsentimentally eloquent
Debussy too in the shape of the Nocturnes and a staggeringly accurate
account of Bartok's First Piano Concerto with Krystian Zimerman as the
perfectly cast soloist. Zimerman is a wonderful foil to Boulez's keenly
perceptive accompaniment, just as vigilant and scrupulous in his own
balancing of textures, just as exact in his rhythmic sense and technical
address. The CBSO responded with equal alertness; even in a brace of
concerts pitched at the very highest level of accomplishment, the concerto
was very special indeed.

FT  22 JAN 93 / People: Invesco lets in Tose
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Philip Tose, chairman of Hong Kong-based Peregrine Investments, has finally
won a seat on the board of Invesco MIM, the UK fund managers in which he has
built a 24.7 per cent stake, but the new non-executive director joins at a
time of considerable upheaval within the group.
Charles Brady took over as chief executive last August, with a brief to
institute a more conservative investment and management style in the wake of
the Maxwell and Drayton Consolidated fiascos.
But since then, Nicholas Johnson, who was in charge of all the non-American
business, has quit, and there is understood to be a good deal of unhappiness
on the Far Eastern team.
Brady has made a great success of his Atlanta, Georgia-based operation, but
has yet to convince the rest of the group that he can manage to turn around
the UK and sustain and develop the Far Eastern operations.
While Tose might have expected his stake to warrant two seats on the board,
he has had to agree to just one, and to the two-year standstill agreement
that he will not increase his shareholding or have any real say in the
management - even if he is technically being consulted on Far Eastern
matters.
Peregrine, which has blossomed since Tose and another former Vickers man,
Francis Leung, struck out on their own at the beginning of 1989, currently
has shareholders funds of around Pounds 255m.
A shrewd man of few words, Tose is renowned for the high-level connections
he has cultivated in both Hong Kong and mainland China.
Most significantly he is close to Li Ka-shing, one of the colony's richest
men, for whom he acted when he was at Vickers da Costa and who was a big
backer of Peregrine from the start.
Tose, 47, whose father was a senior partner at Vickers da Costa in London,
first went out to Hong Kong for Vickers in 1972.
He was soon running the Hong Kong operation, in which position he stayed
until four years after Citicorp acquired the broker.

FT  22 JAN 93 / People: Putting the Names first
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Hugh Bidwell is to take over from John Church as non-executive chairman
of Octavian Group, the Lloyd's agency, in a move which reflects the growing
links between the insurance market and the wider business community.
Sir Hugh, now 58, spent much of his working life in food manufacturing but
has become more involved in City affairs since the mid-1980s and was Lord
Mayor of London between 1989 and 1990.
A Name at Lloyd's since 1986, Sir Hugh says he would 'prefer to forget'
about his own recent underwriting results.
Sir Hugh describes his recent losses 'as about the market average', but
admits to being concerned by the disastrous performance of one of his
syndicates, Bromley 475.
He says that losses on the scale suffered by Lloyd's Names between 1988 and
1991 'must never be allowed to happen again' and that Names' interests must
be better represented in the market.
At Octavian, Sir Hugh says he will remind people 'that the interests of

FT  22 JAN 93 / Technology: Boost for Aids drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Wellcome, the UK drugs group marketing Retrovir, presently the
principal therapy for Aids and HIV-positive patients, jumped sharply last
week on reports of a positive trial for the treatment.
The trial, conducted by the US-based National Institutes of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, compared Wellcome's Retrovir, also called AZT, with
Bristol Myers Squibb's didanosine, also known as ddI, in HIV-positive
patients with ad-vanced disease.
Details of the study showed that AZT was more effective in slowing the
progress of Aids among patients who had not previously used the drug. The
trial ran from October 1989 until May 1992 and involved 617 HIV-infected
patients.
Among 380 sufferers who had not taken AZT before, 18 per cent dev-eloped a
new, previously undiag-nosed Aids-defining condition or died within a year.
That compared with 31 per cent on a ddI dose of 750mg, and 29 per cent on a
500mg dose.
However, for those who had used AZT for eight to 16 weeks previously, ddI
proved more effective. For this group, 33 per cent on AZT developed a new
Aids-defining condition or died within a year, compared with 11 per cent on
500mg of ddI, and 17 per cent on 750mg.
Aids-defining events included yeast infections of the mouth, unexplained
fever or diarrhoea, recurrent herpes outbreaks and the loss of weight.
The two drugs had mixed side-effect profiles, according to the study. Those
on AZT were more likely than those on ddI to suffer lowered blood cell
counts. Those on a 750mg dose of ddI were more likely to develop
pancreatitis than those on a 500mg dose or AZT.
The investigators made no recommendation about changing current therapy. AZT
remains the front-line treatment. However, the trial does show that
combination therapy will play an increasingly critical role in the
management of HIV-related disease.
This year, the US Food and Drug Administration recommended a third
anti-viral agent, Roche's ddC, but only in combination with other agents
such as AZT and ddI.

FT  22 JAN 93 / People: Ralph resurfaces at Glynwed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bruce Ralph, chief executive of Dowty until its acquisition by TI Group last
year, is to join diversified UK engineering group Glynwed International.
A former student in the Hanson mergers and acquisitions school, Ralph, 53,
has been appointed managing director and chief executive designate. He will
be responsible for a reorganised management structure, overseeing six new
operating divisions.
Ralph joined Dowty in 1983 and became deputy chief executive beneath Tony
Thatcher in 1985. Following a shake-up in the board triggered by Dowty's
debilitating move into information technology and mobile communications,
Ralph became chief executive in 1991.
He then began to try to sell the IT division but Dowty's profits and
defences continued to suffer. Unable to make the disposal at a price that
would not damage the balance sheet, Dowty fell prey to TI less than a year
after Ralph assumed the top job.
During the TI bid, however, Ralph was not able to distance himself entirely
from decisions taken by his previous boss. TI claimed that as a member of
the Dowty board he was on watch when the decision was taken to diversify
from Dowty's core aerospace and polymer business.
Since the takeover, TI has retained Ralph in a consultancy role. That
position will end just before he begins with Glynwed on February 1.
Gareth Davies had combined the posts of chairman and chief executive at
Glynwed.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Technology: Taurus the octopus - The progress of the London
Stock Exchange's paperless settlement system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cranking up the biggest technology project to hit the City since Big Bang
was never going to be easy. Taurus, the long-awaited paperless settlement
system that is meant to make it cheaper and safer to deal in the London
stock market, is several weeks into testing.
Like an electronic octopus, its tentacles have begun to spread around the
City, reaching out towards the 280 or so financial institutions which will
eventually be linked into the system.
The process is likely to be a protracted one. This week, the institutions
which will be tied electronically to Taurus - registrars, brokers, market
makers, custodians, large investors - were told that the testing will last
until at least the end of this year. This pushes back the live date for the
project by another six months to the spring of 1994.
Each delay - there have been several since Taurus' first aborted target date
of October 1990 - puts up the costs for London's securities industry.
The official cost/benefit analysis for Taurus, produced by the London Stock
Exchange several years ago, looks increasingly out of date as delays add to
the development costs of brokers and others, as well as the Exchange itself.
The cost to the Exchange was last put at about Pounds 80m, though the latest
delay will push it higher. Each delay also pushes further away the day when
stamp duty - the 0.5 per cent turnover tax on stock market trading - is
finally abolished, adding a further cost to all investors.
The sheer scale and complexity of the project accounts for the latest
lengthening of the timetable. It has been urged on the Stock Exchange by
participants in the system, who wanted more time for testing before the
system was brought into operation.
As John Watson, the Exchange's Taurus project director, warned when testing
began last autumn: 'We're not just implementing one system in one
organisation. There's still a huge undertaking we have ahead of us.'
Taurus is being introduced in three phases, with each phase subjected to
three separate test cycles. The first phase - the part of the software which
deals with the basic settlement function, involving the exchange of stock
for cash - was delivered last autumn, together with the communications
package which had taken far longer to develop than expected.
The second and third elements are due this spring. The most complex part of
the system will be the last to arrive. Known as the benefits package, this
deals with situations like takeovers, rights issues and other events which
affect shareholders' rights and benefits.
Mike Jones, a director of Capel Cure Myers, a nationwide private client
stockbroker, says that the element dealing with benefits is likely to be the
most difficult to implement: 'They account for about 30 per cent of the
code, and 80 per cent of the problems in any stockbroking package.'
Each part of the Taurus system is first put through 'entry testing'. This
involves financial institutions hooking up to the central computer and
putting their own systems through their paces on a simulation package. In
the second stage - known as participant testing - the Stock Exchange's own
system swings into operation, interacting directly with other participants.
This second stage was reached this week, the first big test for the
Exchange's own development work.
Stage three of the tests has been urged on the Exchange by Taurus
participants. They felt that it was not enough to interact individually with
the Exchange through their own electronic link, but wanted to make sure that
all the pieces of the jigsaw fitted into place: in other words, if one
broker instructed the central computer to send shares to another, would the
second broker actually receive them on time?
This extra phase of testing, known as 'many-to-many testing', will involve
groups of participants banding together and conducting trials between
themselves, through the central computer, to make sure all the pieces fit
together.
It is this many-to-many phase of the final part of the system, the benefits
package, that accounts for the latest delay.
A single test cycle will take several weeks: events like rights issues and
takeovers work to specific timetables, allowing time for investors to
receive information and make decisions about whether or not to accept an
offer. A series of these test cycles is expected to take up the last four or
five months of the year.
This latest delay is causing less unease around the City than previous
setbacks. Putting the system through its paces was always expected to be a
convoluted process, and there is general support for the Stock Exchange's
measured approach. 'They have given themselves a more realistic timing,'
says Alison Renison, in charge of Taurus development at Barclays.
The extension of the testing timetable has come at a sensitive moment,
though. With the main season for corporate annual general meetings about to
get under way, the Stock Exchange had hoped to persuade more companies to
pass the necessary changes to their articles of association to allow them to
scrap their share certificates and move on to Taurus.
Despite a steady trickle of companies taking this step over the past year,
most have delayed, preferring to hold off until Taurus finally seems a
reality.
The latest news could take the sense of urgency out of the project,
encouraging companies to put off the amendment until next year's AGM. That
could push up the cost of Taurus still further.
During its first months, the new electronic settlement system will run in
parallel to the existing paper-based arrangements. The duplication will add
to costs for registrars, brokers and the exchange itself, warns Watson.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Management: Flying in the face of corporate ethics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS school teachers of ethics are an understated bunch. They have to
be, otherwise sceptical managers would be even less open to their message:
that ethical behaviour is not a burden but a boon to a company's reputation
and competitiveness.
Yet, on both sides of the Atlantic, the academics' reaction this week to the
unfolding implications of British Airways' 'dirty tricks' campaign against
Virgin Atlantic has ranged from disappointment to surprise, tinged with a
touch of enthusiasm.
'Disappointment that a company in such a leadership position should feel the
need to use these tactics,' was the reaction of one American academic.
'Surprise that a company which has invested so much in building a reputation
for trusting its staff and caring for its customers should risk that by
engaging in such misconduct,' was the comment of another. Their only
enthusiasm was at a juicy new research 'case' on ethics.
The academics are almost unanimous that the judgment of BA's senior
management has not merely been called into question, but that the top is
heavily to blame for the affair, regardless of BA's attempted exoneration of
its chairman and chief executive.
For the members of an organisation to know the difference between acceptable
and unacceptable behaviour - which is more than just a matter of knowing the
law - the lead has to be set consistently from the top, the academics argue.
In the absence of clear indications that particular actions are
unacceptable, managers will tend to try to second-guess the top, and act in
a way which they think their bosses will approve. As several UK academics
suggest, this is especially likely if, as at BA, the head of the
organisation has a reputation for muscularity.
Surprising though it may seem, behaviour towards competitors - other than
anti-trust collusion with them - is one of the least developed areas of the
developing discipline of business ethics.
Because of the field's roots in religion and moral philosophy, its growth
during the 'corporate social responsibility' fashion of the 1970s, and the
impetus it has been given by the financial scandals of the 1980s, most
research and teaching has concentrated on relations between companies and
their most obvious 'stakeholders'.
As a result, the vast majority of business ethics literature deals with
individual behaviour towards office colleagues and subordinates, and with
corporate attitudes to insider trading, to customers (including bribery and
product safety), to the local community, to health, safety and the
environment, and to political issues such as South Africa.
Only recently have relations with suppliers bounced on to the agenda, though
more in Europe than the US. Apart from anti-trust considerations, competitor
relations - ranging from information-gathering to the way one talks to
customers about one's rivals - has rated hardly a mention.
The same blind spot applies to companies. 'Very few corporations have
addressed the ethics of behaviour towards competitors,' says one of few
academics to specialise in the field, Lynn Paine, a professor at Harvard
Business School. An analysis she made of the content of American corporate
codes of conduct showed that fewer than two dozen out of 480 companies gave
any real guidance to employees on methods of gathering competitive
intelligence.
As a model, Paine and others cite three pages on competitive behaviour taken
from a statement of 'standards of business conduct' circulated widely within
Hewlett-Packard, the successful - and reputedly ultra-ethical - US
electronics multinational.
These contrast starkly with BA's alleged behaviour. They include, among
other things, a carefully-defined ban on the use of 'improper' means to
obtain competitive information, and a rule that any statements about
competitors 'must be fair, factual and complete'.
Paine's course on 'information, power and responsibility' teaches, among
other things, that companies which tell their managers and employees to
trust each other, and to tell the truth, should consider the probable
internal impact of behaving in a very different fashion when they deal with
competitors. 'One likes to think one can put these things into boxes, but
I'd question whether one can do so,' says Paine.
She also teaches that, in order to improve the products, services and
profits of their industry, 'companies should consider what is healthy
competition, not just whether one is straying across a legal boundary. The
avoidance of wrongdoing is not enough'.
Contrary to the way critics paint them, few teachers of business ethics are
naive. Most accept that, just as acceptable behaviour varies between
countries, it does by industry, according to the impact within that industry
of each practice. Standards of acceptability differ, for instance, over the
way companies promote their products, gather competitive information and
poach key employees. But as one academic said this week: 'There are limits -
and they're not just the law.'
The same applies to the moot question of whether certain anti-competitor
tactics are only acceptable in takeover battles, or when a small company is
attacking a near-dominant one. Academics are at one that a respectable
Goliath should never use underhand tactics to attack a David, no matter what
the circumstances.

state has opened up previously undreamed of opportunities for western
businessmen to bypass Moscow and deal direct with new decision-makers in the
far-flung provinces.
At the same time, decentralisation, and the emergence of 15 separate states
from the wreckage of the old union has raised the cost and complexity of
doing business. Long-established western companies, used to the dreary but
familiar round of ministries and endless discussions with bureaucrats in
smoke-filled rooms in Moscow, have opened representative offices in new
capitals such as Kiev, Tashkent and Alma Ata.
For some, the trek in search of new business has taken them to
military-industrial plants which two years ago did not officially exist and
appeared on no maps. Such was the fate, for example, of Amersham
International, the privatised UK-based 'health science company' which last
year set up a joint venture with Mayak, a company owned by the Russian
Ministry of Atomic Energy and Industry, to market radioactive isotopes.
These were produced at Chelyabinsk-65, a former top secret military plant in
the Urals region.
Amersham's experience in setting up the joint venture with Mayak and dealing
directly with the local authorities and newly empowered managements in the
Urals was instrumental in its subsequent decision to become a core member of
the recently formed British Health Care Consortium.
The consortium, an effort to take a co-ordinated 'Great Britain PLC'
approach to tackling the challenges and opportunities of the post-Soviet
market, groups together some of the UK's top pharmaceutical, healthcare and
related industries under the chairmanship of Sir Ronald McIntosh, former
director-general of the National Economic Development Council.
The founder members of the consortium are Glaxo, the Wellcome Foundation,
ICI, Amersham International, Smiths Industries Medical Systems and Conder
Projects, a specialist in medical construction.
The consortium enjoys technical support from the counter-trade department of
the London-based Moscow Narodny Bank and close ties with the UK Department
of Health.
Last month, after visits to its base in Yekaterinaburg as well as
Chelyabinsk, Ufa and Izhevsk the consortium and Uraltech, its Russian
partner, finalised a Dollars 36m (Pounds 24m) agreement under which BHCC
companies will design, build and equip hospitals and clinics.
The consortium, drawing on the example of the UK's national health system,
will also help reorganise health care provision in a region blighted by
decades of ecological neglect, heavily polluting industrial development and
the Soviet disregard for public welfare.
The deal will be financed from the proceeds of the export of aluminium and
other products formerly used largely for arms production. The green light
came after the first Dollars 2m flowed into an escrow account at MNB, which
after a recent radical restructuring concentrates on services for exporters
and investors.
With honourable exceptions, UK companies have been slower than other
European companies to get involved in the former communist countries. BHCC
offers 'piggy-back' access for smaller UK companies in what is expected to
be a developing, long-term market in the Urals and eventually other regions
with similar needs.
'The consortium itself is not a non-profit organisation and is not an
exclusive club. We are willing to associate with any UK company, provided
there is no conflict with the core members,' says Sir Ronald.
The groundwork for future expansion follows months of frequent visits to
Yekaterinaburg, building on political support for the project from Russian
president Boris Yeltsin, who was the Communist party boss when the city was
called Sverdlovsk.
'The important thing in deals like this is to make sure that you are dealing
with reliable people and that the supply of goods required to finance the
operation is authorised from the top. All these requirements are met in this
case. Aluminium and other products for export are flowing from the Urals to
St Petersburg, money is flowing into the escrow account, and a solid basis
has been laid for serious business,' says Bill Newman of MNB.
The collapse of the old Communist party structures has been followed by the
restoration of the former tsarist system of regional and provincial
governors appointed by Moscow to act as the central government's eyes and
ears in the provinces. Building good relations with the local authorities is
crucial to the success of deals involving public services such as health.
'The future of Russia could well be decided at the local and micro-level. It
is now possible to do business directly with the movers and shakers in areas
like the Urals, which is far from Moscow but has a population of around 25m
and growing access to hard currency,' Sir Ronald adds.
The importance of close ties with local authorities and enterprises is
equally important in areas such as food where UK companies have set up a
similar consortium in Ukraine.
'Improving food supply and healthcare are the keys to raising morale and
productivity, not just in the Urals but throughout the former Soviet Union.
The hunt for food and the need to take care of sick children and relatives
are the main causes of absenteeism. Separately, the UK food and health
consortia tackle both these key areas head on,' says Bruce Beharrell, who
heads Amersham International's Russian operations and is a key figure in the
BHCC consortium.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Sun editor defends behaviour of the
press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EDITOR of Britain's biggest-selling daily tabloid, Mr Kelvin MacKenzie
of The Sun, emerged defiant yesterday from a two-hour encounter with the
national heritage committee investigating privacy and media intrusion.
Mr MacKenzie told the committee chaired by Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour MP for
Manchester Gorton, that the press was better behaved now than at any time he
could remember, adding: 'There has never been a time when the press is liked
by the sort of people who sit on a committee like this.'
The editor, who admitted to misdemeanours in the past, said: 'We only
publish the truth now and you can't do better than that.'
Mr MacKenzie told MPs: 'We are not going to change our news judgments just
because parliament does not like what it reads in The Sun.'
He defended the paper's recent coverage of the royal family, saying many of
the stories involved public figures and had been widely published abroad.
And he warned MPs that American-style privacy laws, which apply to private
citizens, would not necessarily apply to the royal family.
Every member of his staff had to observe the code of conduct operated by the
Press Complaints Commission, he said, and he was now writing to all Sun
freelances to make it clear they were subject to the code as well.
Mr MacKenzie was followed by Mr Colin Webb, editor-in-chief of the Press
Association news agency and a former deputy editor of The Times, who in an
unflamboyant way said that the present system of self-regulation was working
well.
There was a greater awareness now than he had ever known in his 35 years as
a journalist 'of the need to set and maintain standards and codes of
conduct'.
Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP who is backing legislation to require
mandatory corrections for inaccurate news reporting, said yesterday he was
prepared to accept amendments that would promote press freedom. His bill,
which is opposed by the government, will be debated by MPs next Friday.
Mr Soley said there was a vacuum in controls over the press. He proposes a
statutory Independent Press Authority. But he said the IPA could also have a
role in strengthening press freedom - by reviewing secrecy legislation, for
instance.
With the government proposing legislation on privacy which could restrict
the media, clear rights to press freedom were more important, he said.

BRITAIN is ready to make RAF helicopters available to airlift some of the
Palestinians deported from Israel if a further humanitarian visit by the Red
Cross is agreed.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told MPs last night that if the
security of the operation could be guaranteed, the UK would provide
helicopters based in Cyprus to airlift out of the area between Israel and
southern Lebanon some medical cases and the nine Palestinians whom the
Israeli government admits were deported by mistake.
Mr Hurd emphasised the diplomatic pressure Britain was putting on Israel to
comply with relevant UN directives.

SIR Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, told MPs yesterday that he
had begun informal consultations with local political parties about the
resumption of talks on the province's future.
He is to meet Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in Dublin today.
However an early resumption of talks is unlikely. Britain and Ireland are
expected to first hold two Anglo-Irish conference meetings, under the 1985
Anglo-Irish Agreement, before a suspension for the talks' duration.
Local politicians may also want to wait until after May's local elections in
the province.
Differences of emphasis between unionist and nationalist leaders emerged at
Commons questions yesterday. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the
nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, hinted he wanted the
province's links with the Irish republic higher on the agenda.
Sir Patrick came under pressure from Unionist MPs for saying in December
that he was just a 'facilitator' of talks.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, asked if
the Conservative party was still a Unionist party.
Sir Patrick replied that so long as a majority of Northern Ireland's
population wanted to remain part of the UK it would.
'If, on the other hand, the day should come when the majority should wish
some other citizenship then the UK government would not stand in the way of
that,' he said.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour revolt ends Iraq consensus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE opposition among some Labour MPs to the allied attacks on Iraq turned
into open revolt last night, breaking the broad consensus between the main
political parties.
Mr Tony Benn, a former Labour cabinet minister, led 21 opposition MPs in
voting against the government at the end of the first full Westminster
debate on Iraq since the recent incidents. Labour's official position was to
support ministers in upholding United Nations authority, and the government
won the vote by 156-21.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, acknowledged the unease that had
been expressed by some Labour MPs and by Sir Edward Heath, a former Tory
prime minister, about the purpose of the allied intervention.
He said that the allies' objectives were clear within the United Nations
charter and had been put at risk by Iraq's actions: the coalition aimed to
maintain the integrity of Kuwait; eliminate the threat from nuclear and
chemical weapons; and deter attacks on Shias and Kurds in Iraq.
Mr Hurd expressed disappointment that the Gulf states had made so little
progress in organising the defence of the region since the Gulf war, but
insisted that the extent of UK involvement was reasonable. Some of those now
voicing misgivings about the allied attacks would, he added, have voiced far
larger ones had the coalition not responded to the Iraqi provocation.
Sir Edward argued that the defence of Kuwait should be a matter for the Arab
league since there were no direct British interests there, and expressed
vehement opposition to any prospect of UK ground troops being deployed in
Kuwait. He warned that the actions of the coalition had strengthened Saddam
Hussein and served to alienate other parts of the Arab world.
He also joined the Labour front bench in urging that the United Nations
should be given a greater role in seeking a way forward in dealing with
Iraq.
MPs unhappy with the coalition action also highlighted Sunday's
cruise-missile attack on Baghdad, in which the al-Rashid hotel was hit; the
allies' apparent expectation that they could remove Saddam Hussein; and the
failure to act evenhandedly in support of UN resolutions other than those
applying to Iraq.
Responding to Labour pressure for the government to help resolve the UN's
underfunding, Mr Hurd said that the UN did not have the finance or support
for the task it was taking on, especially since it had begun to get involved
in matters within an individual country as well as between countries. Its
future role would be a serious question for peace-keeping in the world.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Senior Tories warn Lamont against
tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Conservative MPs warned Mr Norman Lamont last night not to risk
aborting the fragile economic recovery with large tax increases in his March
budget.
But the officers of the Tory backbench finance committee, who met the
chancellor as part of an intensive pre-Budget consultation exercise,
signalled that they could accept some extension of value added tax.
Their comments came amid intense speculation that Mr Lamont is ready to end
VAT zero-rating on products and services ranging from newspapers to
children's clothes and domestic fuel.
Tory MPs reported that in a meeting earlier this week Mr Lamont had made
clear that the government's election pledges did not rule out such a move.
Some senior Conservatives also suspect that the chancellor will bring food
into the VAT net at a reduced rate of 5 per cent.
The Treasury traditionally has argued that it would be administratively too
complex to operate a twin-rate VAT regime but it has failed to convince Tory
MPs of its case.
An emerging view among a majority of Conservative MPs that the chancellor
should strictly limit the overall increase in the tax burden in March was
being echoed yesterday by senior ministers.
The sharp rise in unemployment last month confirmed the view of many that
the Treasury's optimism about economic recovery is premature.
Although some cabinet members believe that the prospects for the public
borrowing requirement are sufficiently dire to necessitate an immediate
increases in taxes, others are arguing forcefully Mr Lamont should delay
until the second Budget in December. Mr John Major is understood to share
the cautious approach.
Yesterday's delegation of senior backbenchers suggested that Mr Lamont
should focus also on cutting public spending later in the year before
deciding whether to increase taxes.
They warned the chancellor that significant rises in excise duties -
traditionally one of the most convenient ways for the Treasury to raise
revenue - would simply boost the growing cross-channel trade in spirits,
wine, beer and tobacco.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: CBI calls for moves on growth in
Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MODEST measures to help industrial growth in the March Budget were called
for yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry.
The employers' group said Mr Norman Lamont should resist the temptation to
raise taxes significantly to reduce the government deficit. Any action of
this kind might constrain the patchy signs of an economic upturn.
The CBI wants the chancellor to extend beyond October the temporary increase
in capital allowances that the Treasury announced in the Autumn Statement.
Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee and
chairman of engineering group GKN, called for lower interest rates to help
the 'elusive' recovery.
He said that only when growth was fully established should the government
take action to reduce borrowing. 'Tax increases would give the wrong signal
at a time when confidence is still fragile,' said Sir David.
The CBI's preferred package of measures for the Budget would cost less than
Pounds 1bn.
The measures include continuing for the forseeable future the temporary
scheme by which industrialists can write off 40 per cent of their investment
spending against tax, rather than the normal 25 per cent.
The organisation also wants the Treasury to reduce the burden of advance
corporation tax on some big companies with overseas operations, under which
they may be taxed twice on profits earned abroad.
Other measures would step up support for exporters by lowering premiums
charged by the Export Credits Guarantee Department.
The CBI also wants the Treasury to reduce taxation on small companies by
changing the rules on inheritance tax and capital gains tax.
Sir David said that to pay for these measures the government might have to
consider small increases in personal taxation ahead of the Budget. That
could be accomplished through measures such as raising tax allowances by
less than the inflation rate.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith rounds on PM over rise in
jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME MINISTER came under fierce and sustained opposition attack in the
Commons yesterday as Mr John Smith used the steep increase in monthly
unemployment figures to pour scorn on the government's economic and
employment policies.
In a cogent and sure-footed assault, the Labour leader branded the figures
'horrendous' and accused Mr Major of blighting the lives of millions with
economic policies that had 'failed the nation'.
His onslaught came as a new cabinet sub-committee, charged with reviewing
how existing measures to tackle unemployment might be improved, met for the
first time under the chairmanship of Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords.
The ad hoc group - set up in a clear attempt to deflect mounting criticism -
also includes Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief
secretary to the Treasury.
Ministers from outside the cabinet, not yet named, will include
representatives from the education, environment and social services
departments.
A senior Downing street official said that the main focus of the committee
would centre on maximising the impact of existing policies rather than
devising new ones.
'It will look right across the government at the employment consequences of
all the policies currently being pursued,' he said.
But Downing Street did not rule out consideration of new measures like
Workfare, which would oblige people to work in return for benefit.
Current controversial political issues with implications for employment  -
such as the coal mines and the naval dockyards - will not, however, be part
of the committee's remit.
Acknowledging yesterday's figures were 'deeply disappointing', Mr Major
attempted to defuse Mr Smith's offensive by steering the subject onto
broader economic issues and denouncing Labour's empty rhetoric.
'Neither you nor your colleagues have set out a coherent policy for dealing
with unemployment,' he told the Labour leader.
Labour's policies would 'deliberately drive up unemployment and not create
the conditions for lasting employment.' It was 'this government that has had
the courage to stick to policies to get inflation down.'
But bidding to press home his advantage, Mr Smith used a selection of past
remarks attributed to the prime minister and his colleagues to cast doubt on
the sincerity of yesterday's expressions of concern.
'Aren't you the person who told us 'If it isn't hurting, it isn't
working?'', he asked. 'Weren't you the prime minister whose first reaction
when the pit closures were announced was that they had to be closed 'cleanly
and quickly' and whose chancellor believes unemployment is a 'price worth
paying?''
'How can we possibly believe that your expressions of concern are genuine
when we take all these factors into account?' Mr Smith continued. 'When at
last are you going to give the attack on unemployment the priority which the
nation demands?'

FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: CBI report urges transport funding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government should take advantage of current low contract prices to
reduce the backlog of improvements to Britain's transport infrastructure,
says a Confederation of British Industry report published yesterday.
Investment in transport has been inadequate, says the report, even though
good links are necessary for economic regeneration. The recession has
created an opportunity for investment while contract prices are low, it
says.
The report says rapid development of effective communications in Britain is
jeopardised by fragmentation in planning and implementation, due to
transport investment being handled by at least five Whitehall departments.

MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday announced plans for a cabinet seminar aimed at

The seminar, due to be held on February 2, is intended to follow up the

Brighton last year to ease bureaucratic constraints on enterprise.
A Downing Street official said particular stress would be put on the need to
halt the common practice of adding UK regulations to European Community
directives issued from Brussels.

THE GOVERNMENT'S senior law officer yesterday took the unusual step of
attempting to clarify the confusion over how EC legislation protecting the
jobs and pay of workers in mergers affects the contracting-out of public
services.
Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, said that the European law -
implemented in the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
regulations 1981 - applied where contracting-out transferred an economic
entity as a going concern that retained its identity.
Whether this was the case depended on several criteria, such as whether the
premises, assets, staff, goodwill or customer base were transferred. No
single one of these factors was essential for there to be a transfer, he
said.
Sir Nicholas added that it had been wrong for UK courts to rule that the
Tupe regulations applied only when assets were transferred.
The ownership of assets did not need to change, although that might be a
strong indication of a transfer of an undertaking.
Nupe, the public services union, described the attorney-general's statement
as a 'victory' saying that he had conceded that British courts had got the
law wrong.
A test case launched by the union against the Department of Employment is
scheduled for the Court of Session in Edinburgh today.
The attorney-general's statement was made to the standing committee
considering the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill. Backbench
Tories on the committee called for further action, saying that contractors
had been thrown into confusion over the Tupe regulations.
Dr Robert Spink, Tory MP for Castle Point, said that ministers should go
much further to define the reach of the Tupe regulations.
'I want ministers to do what any French minister would do, by reasserting
the interests of this country,' he said. 'We should resist this silly
directive.'
Mr Hartley Booth, Conservative MP for Finchley, said that so long as
decisions about whether the regulations applied were at the discretion of
the courts, contractors would be 'in a fog'. Until the government created
greater clarity, there would be 'a total block on contracting out'.
The Civil Service unions said they would take out an injunction against the
first government department that releases contracting-out tender documents
that make no mention of Tupe.
Mr Bill Brett, general secretary of the IPMS civil service union, said:
'There is total chaos in government about what to do about Tupe and the
lawyers are, at best, completely confused.'
But he said it was becoming clearer that Tupe applied in far more cases than
the government had originally believed.
'It appears that the only way to influence the government is through the
law, so we will be serving an injunction against the first department which
does not include a Tupe clause in its tender document,' said Mr Brett.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heath leads protests at role in
Gulf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR EDWARD Heath, the former Conservative prime minister, yesterday
expressed vehement opposition to any suggestion that British ground troops
might be deployed in Kuwait.
Sir Edward also used the Commons debate on Iraq to join the Labour front
bench in urging that the United Nations should be given a greater role in
seeking a way forward in dealing with Iraq.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, said no request had been received
from the Kuwaiti government, but Sir Edward emphasised that the defence of
Kuwait should be a matter for the Arab league since there were no direct
British interests there.
In the first opportunity for a full debate at Westminster on recent events
in the Gulf, growing unease among some MPs was apparent. Of particular
concern were Sunday's cruise-missile attack on Baghdad, in which the
al-Rashid hotel was hit, and the purpose of the operations.
While some suggested that there was a danger of drift in the aims of the
allies, Sir Edward was among the most outspoken in calling on the allies to
give up any expectation of removing Saddam Hussein - it alienated the rest
of the Arab world, he warned.
Mr Rifkind said that the hit on the al-Rashid hotel was a 'tragic accident'
but said that the allied operations had gone to great lengths to avoid
hitting non-military sites, and insisted that the ultimate blame must lie
with Saddam Hussein.
'He must bear the responsibility for not bowing to the will of the
international community before force became necessary,' he said.
While Mr Rifkind was unequivocal in his condemnation of Saddam Hussein and
his failure to keep to UN resolutions, Mr Tony Benn, a former Labour cabinet
minister, said he detected a change of tone in the minister's words about
the two 'no-fly' zones in the north and south of Iraq. Mr Rifkind said that
he expected the RAF to be involved in patrolling the two zones for the
forseeable future, but underlined that the existence of the zones did not
affect the territorial integrity of Iraq itself.
Mr Benn, who led a revolt of Labour backbenchers, suggested that it was a
sign that even the government had been slightly chastened by the change of
mood since the raids, but went on to accuse the allies of 'odious hypocrisy'
in the selective importance they attached to the enforcement of only some UN
resolutions.
He warned that the bombing had strengthened Saddam Hussein and undermined
the authority of the UN.
The call from Sir Edward for a personal role for Mr Boutros-Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, in finding a solution and his support for a better
communications system for the UN followed a similar argument for more UN
involvement put by Mr David Clark, the shadow defence secretary.
Mr Clark welcomed the UN Security Council's discussion on Tuesday but said
that it had been limited and a further debate would be useful. He also urged
the government to consider a new resolution which would make it clear that
if Iraq had a government that would abide by UN resolutions, then economic
sanctions would be lifted.

FT  22 JAN 93 / November output down by 0.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POOR performance by the car industry and a drop in metals production were
factors in a 0.5 per cent fall in manufacturing output in November compared
with the previous month.
The drop followed a 0.1 per cent rise in October and altered the flat trend
of manufacturing output since the start of last year. The Central
Statistical Office estimates that output is falling at an annual rate of
about 1.5 per cent.
However, energy industry output was sharply higher in November. Production
of oil and gas from the North Sea rose 9 per cent in the three months to
November compared with the previous three months. Water supply industries'
output rose 3.5 per cent.
The three-month on three-month trend in manufacturing showed a 0.5 per cent
fall in the period to the end of November. Compared with the same period the
year before output was 0.1 per cent lower.
The CSO said most of the fall in manufacturing output between October and
November was due to a 6 per cent month-on-month drop in the production of
motor vehicles. There was also a sharp fall in the output of the metals
industry. Steel companies in particular responded to weak demand by cutting
production.
Other industries where output fell included mechanical engineering and
minerals and mineral products. The latter reflected sluggishness in the
construction industry.
The only industry to buck the trend significantly was electrical and
instrument engineering. Production in this sector was 2 per cent higher in
the three months to November than in the previous three months.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Rise in average earnings slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVERAGE EARNINGS rose by an underlying 5 per cent in the year to November,
slightly below the October figure, which was revised upwards to 5.25 per
cent.
This was the smallest increase in earnings since the current series started
in 1980, but the Department of Employment said the figures were lower in the
1960s.
The slowdown in the rise of average earnings reflected lower pay settlements
agreed around the end of last year. November settlements included 3.6 per
cent at Rover, the car manufacturer, compared with 7.5 per cent the previous
year, and 4.9 per cent for firefighters, compared with 5.6 per cent the year
before.
In manufacturing the underlying increase in average weekly earnings in the
year to November was 5.75 per cent, unchanged from the previous month. The
increase in service sector earnings slowed to 5 per cent in the year to
November from 5.25 per cent in the year to October.
Productivity - output per head - in manufacturing rose 5.4 per cent in the
three months to November compared with the same period a year earlier. This
was the sharpest increase since June 1989 and reflected heavy manufacturing
job losses.
Slowing wage growth and rising productivity caused manufacturing unit wage
costs - wages and salaries per unit of output - to drop 0.3 per cent
month-on-month in November. In the latest quarter unit labour costs were up
by just 0.5 per cent compared with the same period in 1991.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Jobless total at six-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNEXPECTEDLY sharp rise in the jobless total last month pushed
unemployment to its highest level for almost six years.
The number of people out of work and claiming benefit rose a seasonally
adjusted 60,800 in December, almost double the rise expected by economists
and the biggest monthly increase since July 1991.
The 32nd consecutive monthly rise took the jobless total to 2.97m and the
rate of unemployment to 10.5 per cent. Unadjusted unemployment rose by
119,279 to 2.98m. Unemployment is now 86 per cent higher than in April 1990,
when it started to rise.
Although the December figure may have been boosted by a five-week month, the
most likely explanation for the latest jump is that people who lost their
jobs in widespread redundancies last autumn have swelled the ranks of those
claiming benefit.
The Department of Employment said the number of people employed in
manufacturing industry fell by 31,000 in November. That took the total
number of jobs lost in manufacturing since the beginning of the year to
253,000, compared with a fall of 373,000 in the previous year.
Overtime working in manufacturing was 8.85m hours a week in November,
slightly higher than in October, when it was 8.78m, but still the lowest
since the early 1980s.
According to the Department of Employment the trend growth rate in
unemployment has increased to about 40,000 a month. The average rate of
increase in the three months to December was 43,400 compared with 33,900 in
the three months to October. The upward trend in the jobless total affected
all parts of the country with the sharpest rises occurring in the east and
west Midlands, East Anglia and the north. Unemployment is now highest in
greater London where the rate is 11.6 per cent and in the north where it is
12.2 per cent.
One encouraging sign was an increase in the number of unfilled vacancies at
JobCentres - about a third of all vacancies in the economy. They rose by
8,300 in December, the sharpest increase since December 1991, and higher
than the average increase over the three months to December of 3,000 a
month.
The number of jobs lost by Britain's construction industry by mid-summer is
likely to have risen by more than half a million since 1989, the Union of
Construction Allied Trades and Technicians warned yesterday.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Unemployment figures may hurt confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT is traditionally a lagging indicator of economic activity, but
yesterday's news that the seasonally adjusted jobless total increased by
60,800 in December could turn out to be an important pointer to future
economic policy and trends.
Last month's jobless rise was higher than the 55,900 increase of January a
year ago, which, when announced in February last year, was the main
constituent of a 'black Thursday' of dire economic data that rattled the
confidence of the Conservative government as it prepared for the general
election.
The concern with the December jobless increase is less that it will upset
the government than that it will deal a potentially lethal blow to business
and consumer confidence just as these indicators were beginning to hint at
recovery.
The Treasury said that last month's jump in unemployment did not suggest
that economic activity was still falling. Officials said it was typical of
an economy emerging from recession that there should be some bad figures as
well as good.
But the view among economists in the City was that the jobless figures,
together with November's decline in industrial production, contained the
risk of a downward spiral of declining confidence and activity that would
nip any signs of recovery in the bud.
The monthly rise in unemployment accelerated markedly in the final quarter
of last year and there are signs that it could continue at a high level.
Ms Sally Wilkinson, a UK economist at Morgan Grenfell, the investment bank,
said a notable aspect of the jobless figures was that 'no one was coming off
the register', suggesting that demand for labour is very weak.
Another adverse sign is the gap between the increase of 422,000 in
seasonally adjusted unemployment last year and the far bigger decline of
877,000 in the workforce in employment in the 12 months to September last
year. The December figures could be a sign that many of the people who lost
their jobs last year are only now beginning to claim unemployment benefit.
Yesterday's news, following the disappointing retail sales figures for
December earlier this week, prompted a reappraisal in the City of the
government's next policy moves.
Last weekend, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, indicated that he would not
rush to cut bank base rates from 7 per cent, largely because he has limited
scope to keep underlying inflation in the government's band of 1 per cent to
4 per cent.
The 24.6 point jump in the FTSE-100 index yesterday showed that the City is
looking for an early base rate cut of at least 1 percentage point, followed
perhaps by a further cut to 5 per cent later in the year.
The bleak news about the real economy will also have a bearing on the
discussions in the Treasury and Number 10 about the March budget. A further
batch of poor figures in a month's time would make it difficult for the
government to contemplate a tax-raising budget in March to curb the growing
public-sector deficit.
Without an improvement in the economy, Mr Lamont could face a dilemma.
Speculation about lower interest rates depressed sterling yesterday. Some
economists fear that if the pound's weakness continues, underlying inflation
could creep through the top of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent
target range.
In a worst-case scenario, the chancellor could find himself having to judge
the respective merits of a rise in interest rates to curb inflation and a
cut in rates to inject life into the economy.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Chambers stress need to foster recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECONOMY is still in recession but started to show signs of returning to
growth last month, according to the latest quarterly survey by the British
Chambers of Commerce, the umbrella body.
The survey, carried out between December 1 and December 18, found that
manufacturing industries' UK orders and deliveries were still falling
although at a slower rate. Mr Richard Brown, the organisation's director of
policy, said the service sector seemed on the point of growing again.
Export sales for manufacturers and for service companies were at their
highest for 2 1/2 years, reflecting a good response to the increased
competitiveness resulting from sterling's devaluation. Higher export order
books pointed to 'modest and seemingly sustainable growth'.
But the chambers voiced 'extreme concern' about the state of the UK domestic
market. 'With the exception of a negligible growth in the second quarter of
1992, manufacturers have not seen growth since the beginning of 1990 and are
still forecasting further decline as we start 1993,' the report said. 'The
need to foster domestic economic recovery remains strong.'
The good news in the survey - the strongest rise in manufacturers' export
performance since the surveys began in 1985 and improved business confidence
 -was offset by a continued high loss of jobs. The survey of 9,061 companies
employing more than 1.2m points to further redundancies this year.
The percentage of manufacturers planning to reduce their workforces further
in the current quarter exceeded by 19 percentage points the portion planning
an increase. Among service companies the portion planning to reduce staff
levels exceeded those planning staff increases by 9 percentage points.
Capacity utilisation remains low. The percentage of manufacturers working at
full capacity crept up to 20 per cent in the final quarter of last year from
17 per cent in the previous quarter while full capacity working in the
service sector was barely changed at 19 per cent, up from 18 per cent.
As a result employers have no incentive to take on staff or increase
investment. The survey found a marginal increase in investment nationally in
plant and machinery in the past quarter. But the inclination to spend more
varied widely across the regions.
The organisation said it did not expect a large upward revision of
investments in the near future in spite of incentives announced in the
Autumn Statement. It forecast some revival in the third quarter of this year
provided confidence continues to rise.
Business confidence has bounced back strongly after a steep fall at the time
of Britain's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism last
September. But the revival of expectations for profits and turnover has only
restored confidence to the levels of mid 1991. The organisation said it
would take 'another stable three months' to bring confidence to the point
where companies would consider new investment and increased employment.
The survey highlighted differences between the regions. The north-east was
the best-performing region. Exporters of manufactured goods fared
particularly well, but companies still planned to shed labour.
The Yorkshire and Humberside areas, with one in four companies at full
capacity, had more at full capacity than anywhere else.

Gavyn Davies,

Goldman Sachs
The European recession is starting to drag down the UK. Unless Britain has
markedly lower interest rates soon, there may be no recovery. The chancellor
should also act to combat long-term unemployment.
Patrick Minford,
professor of economics,
Liverpool University
Mr Lamont's view that an economic recovery is starting has been blown out of
the water. We need an aggressive programme of lower interest rates to
stimulate demand. Yesterday's figures confirm my worst fears.
David Currie, head of
economic forecasting,
London Business School
The signs about an upturn have become far more patchy. The chances of a cut
in interest rates soon are now higher than they were. But these latest
figures do not alter my view that we will see a recovery this year.
Andrew Britton, director,
Nat Institute of Economic
and Social Research
Yesterday's figures apply to the fourth quarter of last year. No one was
expecting them to be very strong, though I would have liked them to be
better. I still think there will be a significant recovery over the next 12
months.
Wynne Godley, professor
of applied economics,
Cambridge University
Hopes of any real recovery in demand are going to be continually
disappointed in 1993. There may be some rise in economic activity but not
enough to stop unemployment from increasing further and not enough to bring
it down.
Tim Congdon,
managing director,
Lombard Street Research
A full recovery requires not just a return to growth but the achievement of
several quarters of above-trend growth. The evidence is that this will not
happen in the near future. Meanwhile, the European economy is deteriorating.
Andrew Sentance, head of economics, Confederation of British Industry
Mr Lamont would be fully justified in cutting 1 percentage point off base
rates. We have to be very cautious about prospects for a recovery, with the
economy in the first half of 1993 likely to be pretty flat.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Rao fails to put the militant Hindu tiger back in its cage:
The prime minister's inability to inspire opponents of Hindu extremism after
destruction of the Ayodhya mosque
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao has so far failed to defuse the
tensions which have gripped his country since militant Hindus tore down a
mosque and unleashed a wave of inter-religious violence.
In the six weeks since the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque, fighting in
cities in northern India has exacerbated hatreds between Hindus and Moslems.
In the past two weeks in Bombay, 600 people have been killed, more than
100,000 have fled the city, and hundreds of homes, shops and workshops have
been razed.
An uneasy peace has been imposed by tens of thousands of police and
soldiers, but this week tension still hangs in the air. Offices close early
so workers can get home before dark.
Mr Rao has suppressed violence by deploying the security forces, but has
largely proved unable to rally support for defending the ideals of religious
harmony on which independent India was founded. Rather, the initiative has
been seized by those who seek to profit from exacerbating the conflicts -
chiefly the Bharatiya Janata party, the militant Hindu party whose
supporters destroyed the Ayodhya mosque.
Mr L K Advani, the BJP leader, wants an immediate general election to
capitalise on the passions he has aroused. Mr Bal Thackeray, leader of Shiv
Sena, the BJP's Bombay affiliate, warns Moslems that 'the Hindu tiger is out
of its cage'.
Many Hindus are appalled by such hate-filled talk and there has been no
shortage of articulate condemnations of Hindu militancy.
The violence has also prompted acts of heroism - in the recent surge in
violence in Bombay, numerous Hindus shielded Moslem neighbours. Among them
was Sunil Gavaskar, the former national cricket captain, who ran out of his
home to save Moslems from a Hindu mob which had surrounded their car.
Also, Indians recognise the economic damage being done by the violence and
the uncertainty it generates. Bombay, the nation's commercial capital, will
take months to recover, according to leading businessmen in the city.
Some believe confidence will return quickly now that law and order has been
re-imposed, but others are not sure. Mr F T Khorakiwala, sheriff of Bombay
and owner of a department store group, says: 'If the communal discord
escalates, Bombay will be worse than Beirut.'
However, the government has failed to capitalise on anti-militant sentiment.
Mr Rao says that he will act when the time his ripe. He claims the
wide-ranging ministerial reshuffle he completed this week will help
strengthen the government. The prime minister's critics, including members
of the ruling Congress (I) party, say he has already left it too late to
respond to the threat to the nation's stability.
The prime minister himself has contributed to the sense that the government
is drifting. Mr Rao is no orator, able to appeal to the population through
speeches or television appearances. Nor has he been able to rally his
cabinet around an agreed programme.
The one politically brave promise that he made - to rebuild the Ayodhya
mosque - seems to have been quietly shelved after it ran into considerable
criticism inside the Congress party.
But the prime minister's innate caution does not alone explain the
government's inaction. India faces a fundamental challenge which, in the
last six weeks, has grown bigger by the day. Like it or not, the BJP
commands strong support in northern India, the region with the greatest
Hindu-Moslem tensions.
The mosque's destruction certainly alienated some of the party's moderate
supporters, but many others feel inspired.
The BJP suddenly has a clear sense of purpose.
It also seems to have gained ground among the general public: according to
one opinion poll, if a general election were held, the BJP's representation
in parliament would soar from 119 to 170. Not enough to win power, but
enough to vindicate (in narrow political terms) the mosque's destruction.
Another indication of the quiet sympathy many Hindus have for Hindu
nationalism is widespread public indifference towards a blatant pro-Hindu
and anti-Moslem bias shown by the mainly Hindu police in dealing with the
riots.
Congress's failure to mount a strong challenge to the BJP is partly
ideological.
The party, which has ruled India for most of the post-independence period,
advocates secular nationalism in which all races and creeds are treated
equally.
This vision, which had great appeal after independence, has been dulled by
time and by the constant jockeying for power by various religious and
regional interests.
Moreover, over the past decade, Hindus have been unsettled by the
international rise in Islamic extremism.
The momentum generated by the BJP is not unstoppable. It has little support
in south India, where few Moslems live, or in the east, where the left holds
sway in West Bengal.
The liberal intelligentsia sees the dangers of the BJP and is not afraid, in
newspaper articles, to sound the alarm, even by drawing parallels with
Germany and the Nazis.
Moreover, it may prove difficult for the BJP to hold together the forces of
Hindu nationalism for a long time - since Hindus are divided by caste and
language. If memories of Ayodhya fade, BJP unity may fade too.
However, outside the educated elite, the opponents of militant Hinduism are
increasingly afraid to speak out.
They also need inspiration - something Mr Rao has so far failed to provide.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Japan's ruling party wins a royal respite: Charles
Leadbeater finds all eyes are on the imperial wedding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ruling Liberal Democratic party in Japan has found a highly potent
secret weapon to restore its popularity. This addition to its armoury is
164cm tall, 29 years old, speaks five languages, used to be a high flying
diplomat and is about to become a Crown Princess.
The media and public fascination with Masako Owada, who this week was
officially engaged to Prince Naruhito, the next Emperor, is unalloyed good
news for Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the hard-pressed prime minister.
It is not just that the royal wedding has taken minds off the Tokyo Sagawa
Kyubin gangsters, money and politics scandal which dominated the news in the
autumn. Japan's royal family still commands great deference as well as
exciting gossip. From now until the wedding in June everyone will be on
their best behaviour; no one will want to risk the shame of sullying the
wedding preparations by putting political dirty linen on the line.
As the Japanese parliament reconvenes today, the government believes the
worst may be over. It has survived an autumn of scandal when its popularity
plummeted and a vicious power struggle threatened to split the party.
Last month Mr Miyazawa cleared the decks with a cabinet reshuffle which has
restored order at the top of the party. The supplementary budget to revive
the flagging economy was passed and the government has set up a task force
to consider further measures.
The government has weathered the worst of the Sagawa scandal. It is unlikely
there will be further significant revelations, the public appetite may be
satisfied and Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister at the heart of
the affair, has successfully resisted resignation.
The breakaway LDP faction led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance
minister, will not split the party as once thought. It is burrowing its way
into a comfortable position within the established hierarchy.
The refound stability at the top of the LDP is matched by a clear political
timetable for the rest of the year.
In February and March, there will be bad economic news. Profits forecasts
will be cut, wage talks will yield low rises and the stock market will
remain vulnerable to a renewed collapse.
That will be the time for the government to unveil plans for another bumper
package to stimulate the economy, with a mix of public works spending and
tax cuts. Such a package is already being planned.
By May there will be a political truce to clear the way for the royal
wedding which will consume the nation in early June. Then in early July
Tokyo will want to present a calm, united front to the outside world when it
hosts the G7 summit.
By the time people return from their August holidays the economy should be
on the mend, paving the way for Mr Miyazawa to be re-elected in September
for a second term as LDP president and prime minister. That should allow the
LDP to set the seal on a successful year with a general election victory in
the autumn.
At least that is the timetable which the LDP is hoping to keep to. It may
not be that simple.
The LDP's authority rests upon its record for economic growth. That is
facing its greatest challenge for 20 years from an intractable downturn,
which could yet prompt the collapse of the fragile stock market. The economy
is a long way from recovery; until then the LDP's popular support will be
wobbly.
The uncertain international environment could throw up issues which the
government will find difficult to resolve. The Clinton administration may
take a tougher line over trade, according to comments on Tuesday by Mr
Mickey Kantor, the new US trade representative, who said tariffs on minivan
imports could rise sharply, there would be a row over the US-Japan
semi-conductor agreement if the US share of the Japanese market did not
reach 20 per cent and the controversial Super 301 trade sanctions may be
reintroduced.
Japan's farmers know the rice market is almost certain to be opened to
imports to help secure a Gatt deal. However they will want to extract the
maximum political price for going along with the government's plans.
The LDP could also face a more effective opposition after Mr Makato Tanabe's
resignation as chairman of the Social Democratic party. The new SDP
leadership seems prepared to consider reform of the so-called peace
constitution and the international role of Japan's self-defence forces in an
effort to modernise the party's image.
Although the Sagawa scandal may have passed its peak, the shadow it has cast
over the political system has not lifted. Mr Miyazawa's popularity is yet to
recover.
If his ratings are still depressed in the autumn, the party will grow
alarmed that he may damage its election chances. That could spark off a
power struggle between at least four senior LDP figures to replace him.
After an awful autumn, Japan's political leadership has won a respite. But
it may be short-lived and once the secret weapon of the royal marriage is
launched into imperial orbit the earthly sense of political crisis may
return.

FT  22 JAN 93 / US warplanes fire at Iraqi radar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM, MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS and JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK, BAGHDAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ said it remained committed to a ceasefire ordered by President Saddam
Hussein earlier this week in spite of yesterday's incident in which US
warplanes fired on an Iraqi radar and missile site.
In Baghdad the foreign ministry said it was 'committed to the ceasefire'
declared on Tuesday as a goodwill gesture towards the newly installed US
President Bill Clinton, while in New York Mr Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's UN envoy,
simply called the attack 'unfortunate'.
'From Iraq's point of view there is no change on the status of the
ceasefire. It still stands,' Mr Hamdoon said.
Yesterday's incident was apparently triggered when an Iraqi radar near
Mosul, in northern Iraq, 'illuminated' a French Mirage jet on reconnaissance
over the northern no-fly zone.
A US F-4G Wild Weasel escorting the French aircraft then fired a
radar-seeking missile at the Iraqi installation and an F-16 Fighting Falcon
dropped cluster bombs. Iraq denied that an Iraqi missile battery had locked
onto an Allied warplane.
Some US officials and diplomats in Washington were surprised by the
incident, which seemed to run counter to a feeling in the west and at the UN
that Iraq was being more co-operative, and that the military escalation of
the last week could be reversed.
However after the incident the new US president made it clear he would
continue US policy of taking a tough line with Baghdad. 'We are going to
adhere to our policy. We're going to stay with our policy. It is an American
policy,' Mr Clinton said.
Mr Warren Christopher, the new secretary of state, said the administration
was determined to ensure Iraq obeyed UN agreements that ended the 1991 Gulf
war.
General Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, underlined
the point when he said there had been a 'seamless web' between the outgoing
President George Bush and the new President Clinton, adding that any foreign
leader who might think the new president was untested was 'very much
mistaken.'
US officials said the rules of engagement for coalition aircraft patrolling
the two air exclusion zones over northern and southern Iraq remained
unchanged under the new US administration: aircraft may fire only in the
event of threatening Iraqi action, which includes 'illumination' by air
defence radar.
'When their radar illuminates our pilots, we are going to protect our
pilots,' Mr Christopher said.
A planeload of UN arms inspectors landed in Baghdad yesterday and the UN
said it did not believe the US attack would affect plans to send five more
planeloads and their equipment today and tomorrow.
Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN inspection operation said about 70 weapons
inspectors would arrive in Iraq on a semi-permanent basis over a period of
three days.
Mr Paul Brough, head of the 25 member chemical weapons destruction team,
said the immediate project was to complete the destruction of chemical
weapons and agents consolidated at the Muthana plant south-west of Baghdad.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Turkey rejects Syrian call for water agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY has rejected Syrian attempts to renegotiate a six-year-old protocol
allocating water from the Euphrates, but sought to reassure Damascus about
continued supplies across the common border.
At the end of two days of talks in the Syrian capital with Mr Suleyman
Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, Syrian officials
again urged Ankara to increase the 500 cubic metres a second it currently
guarantees.
Syria claimed Turkey had made an undertaking when the then prime minister
Turgut Ozal signed the water protocol in 1987 to seek a more permanent water
agreement once Turkey's Ataturk dam is filled.
Syria relies on the river for up to 60 per cent of power generation and much
of its farm production. The issue has come to a head as the Ataturk dam has
neared completion and Turkey has outlined plans to start irrigating the
Harran plain close to the Syrian border in May, diverting more water from
the river.
Under Turkey's Gap project, 1.6m hectares is to be irrigated in the
Euphrates and Tigris river valleys, a project which has been the major bone
of contention between Turkey and its downstream neighbours, Syria and Iraq.
According to one Turkish newspaper, Mr Demirel promised to convene a foreign
ministers meeting to settle the issue.
However, diplomats say Turkey is unlikely to concede Syrian demands and
instead has offered a variety of joint development projects.

FT  22 JAN 93 / LDP's public spending package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liberal Democratic party leaders yesterday signalled they stand ready to
stimulate the economy with another public spending package early this spring
if the economy is still in the doldrums, writes Charles Leadbeater.
A special LDP task force which is considering extra measures to boost the
economy is likely to recommend further proposals aimed at stabilising the
financial system which is beset by mounting bad debts.
Separately Mr Kabun Muto, head of the LDP's tax panel, added his weight to
business leaders' recent calls for a temporary income tax cut of about
Y6,000bn (Pounds 30bn) to be introduced in the summer.
The economy's weakness was underlined by the 0.5 per cent contraction in the
money supply last year with December 1991, the fourth month of contraction,
according to figures published by the Bank of Japan.
Japan's money supply expanded by just 0.6 per cent last year, compared with
growth of 3.6 per cent in 1991.

FT  22 JAN 93 / N African birth rate falls steeply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE population explosion in North Africa is over, according to a leading
French demographer, Prof Youssef Courbage, writes Edward Mortimer.
Birth rates in the region are falling rapidly, and European fears of a flood
of Arab immigrants are wildly exaggerated, Mr Courbage told a conference in
Brussels yesterday.
In fact, he added, the working-age population in Algeria, Morocco and
Tunisia will level off in about 2005, when the number of job applicants will
begin to decrease.
'Just as Europe's bulging baby-boom generation leaves working life for
retirement, and will need to rely on a sufficient labour force - foreign
workers in particular - to finance it, the Maghreb labour markets, where
labour will be in short supply, will be hard-pressed to meet export
demands.'
Mr Courbage, a senior researcher at the Institut National d'Etudes
Demographiques in Paris, was speaking at a workshop on Europe and the
Mediterranean at the Centre for European Policy Studies.
The decrease in fertility in the Maghreb countries is acknowledged by the UN
and the World Bank, he said, but those organisations had not yet taken the
full measure of the decline.
The UN had significantly overestimated fertility in all three countries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BLAZING supertanker fully laden with almost 2m barrels of crude started
spilling oil into the sea off the northern tip of Sumatra yesterday
triggering a regional anti-pollution alert.
Salvage experts were flying to the scene to check the extent of the spillage
from the 255,312-tonne Danish owned Maersk Navigator, abandoned by its crew
and still drifting after colliding with another tanker.
Fire-fighting vessels and tugboats were also on their way from Singapore
amid indications that the spilled oil was being driven by winds towards the
coast of Malaysia.
The supertanker was carrying about 1.9m barrels of crude from Oman to Japan.
At least one of the supertanker's cargo tanks was ruptured and spilling oil,
fuelling a blaze that might take days to extinguish, a spokesman for owner
AP Moller (Singapore) told Reuters.
He said pollution was so far reported to be minimal.
'A salvage tug is now hosing down the front of the tanker but the ship
remains on fire along the port side,' the spokesman said.
He said oil was spilling from at least one of 12 cargo tanks of the ship,
which collided with another tanker near the entrance to the Malacca Strait
between Malaysia and Sumatra early yesterday. Oil experts said earlier that
most of the leaked oil, which was a light crude, would evaporate before
hitting the coast, and the environmental impact was therefore likely to be
limited.
The smaller ship, the Sanko Anna is believed to have escaped with only minor
damage.
The Malaysian authorities have put their coast guards on alert and say the
collision once again demonstrated the need for concerted action on
navigation problems in the Malacca Straits, one of the world's busiest
waterways.
The accident was the second tanker mishap this month. The Braer spewed
thousands of tonnes of oil into the sea after running aground in the
Shetland Islands off the Scottish coast.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S railway unions are on the verge of signing a productivity
agreement which will release about ADollars 680m (Pounds 307m) in government
funding for modernising rail services.
Mr Martin Ferguson, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions,
said the central elements of the deal were agreed with the National Railways
Corporation (NRC) yesterday. The deal requires ratification by the
Industrial Relations Commission, the national labour court, but it is
expected to pave the way for the creation of an integrated national rail
freight system.
Mr Vince Graham, NRC managing director, said he hoped the agreement would be
completed by the end of this month. The deal will allow the NRC to take
control of five separate rail freight systems run by state governments.
Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime minister, earmarked ADollars 680m for
railway modernisation in his One Nation economic statement in February last
year, which provided ADollars 2.3bn to stimulate the sluggish economy. The
funding was contingent on productivity and operating agreements between the
unions, the NRC and the state governments which have resisted integration of
the systems.
About 7,000 jobs are expected to be created.

<TEXT>
KHMER ROUGE guerrillas yesterday rejected last-minute diplomatic efforts to
persuade them to adhere to the Cambodian peace accords and take part in
elections in May.
Mr Ali Alatas, the Indonesian foreign minister who has been attempting to
mediate a solution to the Cambodian conflict, said that he had failed in a
bid to persuade Mr Khieu Samphan, the nominal Khmer Rouge leader, to
co-operate with the UN peacekeeping operation.
After talks at the Indonesian embassy in Bangkok, Mr Alatas said he
regretted that the Khmer Rouge leader had maintained his view that 'his
party could not rejoin the process and could not as of now participate in
the elections.'
Political parties must be registered for the polls by the end of this month.
The failure of yesterday's talks means that Cambodia will almost certainly
be partitioned after the elections, with the future government controlling
most of the country's territory and Khmer Rouge guerrillas holding the rest.
The United Nations and the four Cambodian factions which signed the peace
agreements in Paris in 1991 will therefore have failed in their mission to
bring peace and democracy to the whole of Cambodia.
One diplomat said he was concerned that the Cambodian peace accords would
suffer the same fate as those for Afghanistan. 'Two years later everyone is
still fighting and they have 1m refugees,' he said.
Mr Alatas said he hoped the Khmer Rouge would not actively obstruct the
elections.
He added that there was broad agreement among interested parties - except
for the Khmer Rouge - that a presidential election should be held about two
or three weeks before the general election.
The idea is to bring Prince Sihanouk to power as president as a stabilising
force while the newly-elected assembly negotiates a constitution.

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD and Poor's, the international credit rating agency, has upgraded
Israel's sovereign debt rating in response to what it views as an improved
political outlook in the Middle East, progress in economic reforms and the
granting of US loan guarantees to back Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.45bn) in
foreign borrowing.
The move comes as the government is preparing to approach international
lenders for funds to be borrowed against the first tranche of the loan
guarantees to help it cover a projected Dollars 2bn current account deficit.
The guarantees encouraged the government to plan infrastructural investment
to help the economy cope with immigration from the former Soviet Union.
Standard and Poor's said it was upgrading Israel's long-term external debt
to triple-B from its previous rating of triple-B minus, the lowest
investment grade rating. Its short-term foreign currency rating was likewise
raised to A-2 from A-3.
The disappearance of Soviet backing for Israel's Arab foes, the weakening of
Iraq and the Middle East peace talks begun in 1991 all diminished regional
tensions, reduced instability and lessened the economic burden of defence,
said Standard and Poor's.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Hungary torn between gentleman and the jackboot: The ruling
party is facing a far-right challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S political stability and that of much of central Europe could hinge
on the outcome of the congress of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum
which begins today in Budapest. Three years after Mr Jozsef Antall led his
party to victory at Hungary's first free elections, the moderate prime
minister faces a struggle for the soul of the party against right-wing
nationalists led by Mr Istvan Csurka.
The ultra nationalist writer is seeking to swing the forum away from the
moderate conservatism, which has attracted foreign investors, towards a more
assertive nationalism tinged with xenophobia and anti-semitism. He hopes to
capitalise on voter dissatisfaction with the results of economic reform to
date, popular demands for the punishment of former ruling communists and
nervousness about rising anti-Hungarian sentiment in neighbouring states
where more than 3m ethnic Hungarians live.
The latest opinion polls show that the forum, which gained around 25 per
cent of the vote but 43 per cent of the parliamentary seats in the 1990
elections, is now supported by only 8 per cent of the electorate.
Mr Antall is expected to argue that the party must strengthen its appeal as
a party of the centre if it is to retain its position at the heart of
Hungarian politics and keep Hungary an island of tranquility in an
increasingly volatile region. That means winning back voters nostalgic for
the lost security of the communist years, competing with the youthful Fidesz
party for the younger vote, and convincing waverers that the liberal
economic reforms, and open-door policy for foreign investment, are the only
ways to ensure a return to the stable growth which will raise incomes and
reduce unemployment from present politically dangerous levels.
For months Mr Csurka has been waging his campaign for a radical right-wing
shift in the forum's policies through an unremitting barrage of essays and
pamphlets.
The most famous was a fiercely nationalist, anti-semitic diatribe thrown
into the still pond of the August summer holidays. He called on the HDF, and
Hungarians at large, to resist a conspiracy of Jews, communists, liberals,
journalists and bankers who threatened Hungary's identity. He also
re-awakened the debate over the future of the 3m ethnic Hungarians who now
live outside the boundaries drawn by the 1920 Treaty of Trianon which
deprived Hungary of two-thirds of its former territory. He provided
ammunition to anti-Hungarian nationalists in neighbouring states by
referring to Hungary's Lebensraum, a term coined by the Nazis for
territorial expansion. To crown it all, he urged Mr Antall, who is ill with
cancer, to resign.
Most recently Mr Csurka has turned his guns on the western companies which
have invested more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) in Hungary over the last
three years, more than in any other east European country. One bizarre
allegation gives a flavour.
Westerners, through their agents in the press, had inspired the recent
outbreak of pig-plague so they could snap up Hungarian meat processors
cheaply, he alleged.
The nationalist writer's eccentric rhetoric, far from condemning him to the
margins of politics, has strengthened his position.
However, Mr Antall is unwilling to jeopardise the stability which he prizes
so much by breaking with Mr Csurka, because this would split his party,
cause the loss of its parliamentary majority, and open an electoral second
front on the right of the forum in the 1994 elections.
Yet the prime minister is acutely sensitive about the damage to Hungary's
international reputation caused by Mr Csurka's continued role in the
governing party. Mr Antall's own background in the Hungarian gentry gives
him little in common with Mr Csurka's crude populism. The prime minister's
moderate supporters hope that their command of the party leadership and
control of the agenda will allow them to head off any challenge from the
floor.
The far right plans to strengthen its influence by making gains at the
expense of moderates in the policy-making 20-man party praesidium. But Mr
Antall yesterday threatened to resign if the the praesidium elections did
not confirm his moderate line. The main question for Mr Antall and his
supporters is not so much how to prevent Mr Csurka's supporters either
taking over the party or leaving it, but how many policy concessions the
prime minister will have to make to keep the party together until the
elections.
Pessimists fear that the governments pre-congress purge of alleged liberals
from the state-owned radio and TV, one of the Csurka nationalists main
demands, could well be a harbinger of things to come. But Mr Antall is
expected to survive as party leader and prime minister of a country which is
well aware that a hardening of nationalist rhetoric in support of ethnic
Hungarians across the present frontiers could bring Balkan-style tensions to
the borders of western Europe and dash hopes of the prosperity which lies
tantalisingly around the corner.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Nato blessing for the Euro-corps
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany yesterday signed an agreement with Nato on how their
planned 'Euro-corps' of some 35,000 soldiers could operate within the
Atlantic alliance, and invited other European countries to join the force.
This was the most concrete achievement of a day set aside by Paris and Bonn
to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Franco-German treaty, which since
the era of De Gaulle and Adenauer has generated a series of advances in
European integration.
President Francois Mitterrand flew to Bonn to join Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
lauding Franco-German ties as a model relationship between countries. But at
the ceremony in Bonn's new national art gallery, the German leader warned
that western Europe could still not consider itself safe from the evils of
nationalism. 'The ghost of nationalism is not just at home in the Balkans,'
said Mr Kohl. With Germany in particular plagued by a racist backlash
against immigration, there was still a danger of 'a relapse into intolerance
and chauvinism'.
A joint statement by Mr Pierre Joxe and Mr Volker Ruhe, defence ministers of
France and Germany respectively, invited 'our partners in Europe to
participate in the (army) corps, because France and Germany do not consider
their co-operation as exclusive'. The Euro-corps, to be formed out of the
nucleus of the current Franco-German brigade and based in Strasbourg by
1995, initially worried Washington, because it appeared to rival Nato
commitments.
Yesterday's accord, signed between General John Shalikashvili, the top Nato
and US commander in Europe, and the German and French chiefs of staff,
allows Nato to call on the Euro-corps in time of crisis. But, at French
insistence, Nato commanders must deploy the Euro-corps as a unit and not
split it up. With a link to Nato now established, the Euro-corps may now
attract wider participation. Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg have expressed
interest in joining it.
The most spectacular example of recent Franco-German co-operation has come
in the form of Bundesbank support for the French franc, when it was under
speculative attack.
Mr Kohl reaffirmed backing for France's fight to keep the franc's parity
with the D-Mark.

<TEXT>
Foreign currency reserves of the Czech central bank fell from Dollars 847m
to Dollars 482m in the three weeks since the separation from Slovakia,
writes Patrick Blum from Prague. The drain reflects a strong demand for
foreign currency from commercial banks in response to the demand for hard
currency from individuals and companies nervous about the expected split of
the former Czechoslovak currency into Czech and Slovak crowns.
The decline in central bank reserves has not led to an outflow of reserves
from the banking system as a whole. The Slovak central bank has reported
similar decline in foreign currency reserves with many Slovak citizens
buying hard currency believing the Slovak crown will be devalued once the
split, originally scheduled for mid-year but now expected sooner, takes
place.

Germany's chemicals industry is facing its worst year since the last
recession in 1982, according to Mr Wolfgang Hilger, president of the Verband
der Chemischen Industrie manufacturers' association, writes Christopher
Parkes in Frankfurt.
Falling prices, rising costs and flat output are expected to reduce profits
further in 1993, added Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman of Bayer. He expected
a further slight drop in prices, while other factors would remain unchanged.
Although industry sales fell only 1.6 per cent to DM171bn (Pounds 70bn) last
year, profits dropped 30 per cent following falls of 25 per cent in 1991 and
20 per cent in 1990. Mr Hilger, who is also chairman of Hoechst, said
markets were 'dead' and the decline could cost 20,000 jobs in the west this
year.

<TEXT>
THE European parliament yesterday called for tighter controls on oil tankers
operating in EC waters, after the Braer disaster in the Shetlands, writes
Lionel Barber in Strasbourg. MEPs criticised member states and the
Commission for failing to crack down on rogue tankers operating with
inadequately trained crews, but praised the Commission's Ecu700,000 (Pounds
566,000) aid for Shetland's stricken farmers and fishermen.
The parliament urged tougher safety measures, including a ban on oil tankers
more than 15 years old from EC ports, setting a date for banning oil tankers
without a double hull from EC waters, obligatory pilot guidance when tankers
pass near the coast, as well as radar control of vessels in dangerous areas,
and inspections of ships in EC ports.
Last night the International Maritime Organisation said the move was doomed
to fail because the bulk of the world tanker fleet was built in the 1970s
and only a few had double hulls.

FT  22 JAN 93 / World Bank may relax rules to help Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank is about to change one of its fundamental regulations
governing its lending policies in an attempt to raise the desperately low
level of investment in the former communist states, especially Russia.
The Bank's board, which met last week, is now leaning towards waiving its
'negative pledge' rule for the financing of projects in the former communist
and a few other states. The rule, binding on the states which join the Bank
and participate in a Bank programme, lays down that the state, or state
enterprises, cannot give equal or more favourable terms to other investors
than they have to the Bank.
This means, in practice, that a state cannot pledge the future income from a
project, such as an oil well, to other banks where such a pledge has already
been given to the Bank. It has inhibited other lenders, especially the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, from advancing credits
particularly in the energy sector where much of its lending is concentrated.
Mr Sergei Konichev, chairman of the Russian Development and Project Finance
Bank, said this was 'a very important and positive policy step' in relations
between foreign banks and Russian companies. 'Nothing much has happened in
the field of investment in Russia for the past three years, and this could
help a lot,' he said.
Mr Anthony Toft, a World Bank official, said they were still working out the
details of how to modify the policy. 'There are many factors to be
considered when banks or companies are considering making investment in the
former Soviet Union - but the people there themselves think that they need
to be able to offer some sort of security now or investment will not come,
even if everything else was thought to be right.'
The Bank's policy has been put to the test most of all in the former
communist states - defined as 'economies in transition' - because almost all
enterprises are effectively state owned, and thus all are covered by
negative pledge.
However, the Bank is determined to retain the rule in the case of existing
assets - applying a waiver only where investment can be shown to produce a
new or increased stream of income from which repayments could be made.
Because of the scale of the Bank's operations and borrowing needs, negative
pledge has been required to reassure its creditors of the ability of its
debtors to repay large loans.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Car makers lower EC sale target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN car makers are lowering their forecasts for new car sales in west
Europe because of the prospect of declining economic growth in the European
Community.
EC sales of new cars and light commercial vehicles (up to 5 tonnes gross
vehicle weight) are forecast to fall by 7.5 per cent this year to 12.84m
from 13.9m in 1992, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers'
Association. The German vehicle market is expected to suffer one of the
sharpest declines, with a fall in sales of around 10 per cent. EC
governments should offer subsidies and tax incentives to stimulate sales of
electric cars, according to a report by members of the European Parliament.
The report calls for action to encourage a switch to 'cleaner' cars in order
to ease the burden placed by exhaust emissions on towns and cities.
The report claims that an achievable target for the use of electric cars in
towns is 7 per cent of total vehicle volume by 2002. Studies show that 80
per cent of car journeys cover fewer than seven miles, says the report. Most
electric cars would have a range of between 70 and 140 miles before
batteries needed recharging.

French President Charles de Gaulle and West German Chancellor Konrad
Adenauer signing the pact on January 22 1963 at the Elysee palace in Paris.
The main provisions of the treaty, which, according to its preamble, was
designed to put 'an end to a centuries-old rivalry,' provided for
co-operation on a broad range of policy, notably on foreign affairs and
defence.
After the ceremony, De Gaulle said that the pact's importance was 'not only
because it turns the page after so long and so bloody a history of struggles
and battles, but also because it opens wide the gates of a new future for
France, Germany, Europe, and, in consequence, the whole world.'
Adenauer responded: 'You have expressed the feelings of all those who ...
have shared in this work in such a perfect manner.  I have nothing to add.
Each of your words corresponds to our hopes.'
The two men then embraced.

<TEXT>
NO ONE expected that the New Year beacons lit to launch the EC's single
market would herald a completely smooth transition to a barrier-free Europe.
But yesterday's news from Brussels that enforcement of single market
legislation will for the moment be lenient indicates that the start-up could
be more problematic than many hoped.
The most vigorous response to the statement by Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi,
internal market commissioner, came yesterday from British industry. In
Europe's biggest economy, by contrast, the Federation of German Industry
(BDI) reacted with equanimity. It called the announcement a rational
response to individual countries' delays in implementing legislation.
Germany had still to implement 20 per cent of single market legislation and
Italy more than 30 per cent, said Mr Reiner Franz, head of the BDI's
European policy division.
A special working party set up to monitor any difficulties encountered by
German business had received 'very few' complaints. These mostly concerned
complications over turnover tax, Mr Franz added.
Officials at the Germany's motor manufacturers' association said all was
running smoothly. 'It is not as though the single market fell suddenly from
the sky,' one said.
British industry was less sanguine. 'We take a very strong view about the
need for uniform enforcement so that all countries play squarely by the
rules,' said the Confederation of British Industry. The CBI is concerned
about what it calls a 'mess' in introducing a uniform EC-wide system for
collecting value added tax.
Ms Anne Robinson, head of the policy unit at Britain's free-market Institute
of Directors, said of the EC Commission: 'Their job is to make sure that
there is free access to goods and services in the single market. They
shouldn't be turning a blind eye.'
ICI, the British chemical company, adopted a less tough stance, saying of
single market infractions: 'There are bound to be companies outside the UK
which haven't got their act together.'
Small business could, on the other hand, suffer from lack of enforcement. Ms
Lindsay Wittenberg, a European business consultant based in Hove on the
Sussex coast, said yesterday's statement 'diminishes the seriousness of the
whole thing. What does it do for the image of the Commission if they say it
doesn't really matter what companies are doing?'
UK companies habitually point to Italy as failing to live up to single
market rules. However, Italian companies and government officials said
yesterday it was far too early to monitor effectively the workings of the
single market.
Companies say the main problems have arisen over confusion in government
departments, especially those dealing with customs and VAT. Officials admit
to confusion and say the difficulties have been caused by the large number
of ministerial orders which need to be sent round departments explaining
government decrees.
have either not yet been circulated or they have yet to be formulated. As a
result bureaucrats lower down have tended to operate by existing
regulations.
Dutch road hauliers, who carry more than 20 per cent of cross-border road
cargo traffic in the EC, have so far reported few problems at EC borders.
'We are cautiously optimistic that the internal market has got off to a good
start,' according to Mr Erik Runia, secretary for international affairs at
the Royal Dutch Road Haulage Association (KNV) in The Hague.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Economists warn on solidarity pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE proposed solidarity pact between the government, opposition, Lander and
trade unions, will be insufficient to pull the east German economy out of
stagnation, according to German economists.
Eastern Germany will remain a burden on central government unless the
Bundesbank cuts interest rates, the unions stop insisting on wage parity
between the east and west Landers, and subsidies are extended to industries
not yet privatised, according to Berlin's authoritative economics research
institute, DIW.
'We cannot even begin to talk about eastern Germany catching up if these
three elements are not included in a solidarity pact,' said Mr Heiner
Flassbeck, one of the chief economists at DIW.
The warnings coincide with economic forecasts by both the DIW and IWH, the
economics research institute in the eastern city of Halle, showing how the
gap between revenue and expenditure in east Germany is this year expected to
widen to 29 per cent, an increase of 13 per cent compared to 1992. According
to the DIW forecast, revenue is estimated to total DM312.5bn (Pounds
128.6bn), an increase of DM16.60bn on last year, while expenditure will rise
to DM341bn, an increase of DM29.4bn.
Figures for gross domestic product is expected to decline by nearly 1 per
cent to 3.5 per cent this year. However, this figure does not reflect real
growth when set against the sharp drop in GDP which fell by 31.4 per cent in
1991. The IWH estimates that unemployment is likely to settle at 18 per cent
of the total labour force, although it is already as high as 40 per cent in
some regions.
Growth forecasts may, however, be revised downwards since the recession in
west Germany could force its medium-sized companies to reconsider current
investment plans for the east.
As a first step towards attracting investment from the western to the
eastern Lander, Mr Flassbeck says interest rates must be lowered, otherwise,
'we could see a stagnation of investment in eastern Germany. The eastern
Lander would require an annual investment rate of DM120bn a year . . . only
then can we talk about the region catching up.'
Current annual western German private investment in the eastern Lander
totals DM20bn - a fifth of west Germany's annual private investment.

An illegal programme may be continuing in Russia to produce biological
weapons despite a ban announced by President Boris Yeltsin nine months ago,
according to Mr Douglas Hogg, minister of state at the British foreign
office, writes David White, Defence Correspondent.
In a report to be broadcast last night by BBC's Newsnight programme, Mr Hogg
said the UK had information 'from some sources' that there had not been full
compliance with the decree.
Dr Vladimir Pasechnik, an expert who defected from the Soviet Union in 1989,
told the programme that an institute in St Petersburg had been working on a
genetically manipulated strain of plague that could be used by terrorists.
Biological arms are prohibited under a 1972 international convention.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Waigel cuts backed by Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said yesterday that the
Bundesbank had given a 'positive' response to his plans for spending cuts of
up to DM20bn (Pounds 8.2bn) per year.
After a trip to the central bank council meeting in Frankfurt to present his
package, he said its members had given a cautious green light to his
immediate plans for a DM10bn increase in borrowing, devoted entirely to the
extra costs of the current recession.
'The German Bundesbank considers a higher net borrowing requirement,
justified in this way, as defensible,' he said, 'provided that the overall
concept of the federal consolidation programme is put into effect in its
main provisions.'
His words supported the widespread expectation that the Bundesbank will be
prepared to relax its interest rates in the coming weeks, once it sees the
full outlines of the government's planned 'solidarity pact' with employers,
trade unions and the 16 state governments.
At the same time, the ruling coalition spelt out more details of the
programme it has drawn up, alongside the savings package, to boost economic
development and investment in east Germany, the intended beneficiary of the
solidarity pact.
They include an agreement by the central government to take over the entire
debts of the Treuhand privatisation agency, and the accumulated debts of the
former East German government, instead of asking the five eastern states to
share the cost of repaying half of them.
From 1995 onwards, the eastern Lander and Berlin will also benefit from a
transfer of DM60bn in state subsidy, to assume their full public spending
responsibilities.
The package of 18 specific measures, also including more money for
investment subsidies for small enterprises, the extension of special
depreciation allowances, a new deal for sharing the cost of environmental
damages, and another DM10bn for modernising the housing stock, has been
worked out by the government and the parliamentary parties in the coalition.
Mr Waigel said that his savings plans in the west had met with broad
approval from the Bundesbank, to which he had appealed directly to see in
them greater room for manoeuvre to reduce its leading interest rates.
He said the central bank welcomed in particular his moves to reduce the
pressure of public borrowing on the capital markets, by introducing an
increased oil tax, and road fund tax, from 1994 to pay off DM15bn in debts
of the German railways, and also to find new ways of servicing the state's
accumulated housing debts. That would remove a debt financing need for some
DM30bn from the capital markets, he said.
There was no immediate response from the central bank, and no move yesterday
to adjust interest rates.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Urgent appeal by Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL

<TEXT>
An urgent appeal was yesterday issued by Mr Edzard Reuter, the head of
Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial group, for business leaders and
politicians to give the country a new sense of direction, writes Quentin
Peel.
He said the country was facing both an economic and a psychological crisis
with unification, which required a complete rethink and reorientation of
German society. But he warned that far too many leaders of business, trade
unions and politicians were burying their heads in the sand.
In a full-page article in Die Zeit, the weekly newspaper, Mr Reuter said
that the country must become dedicated to both integration and innovation.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Swedish inflation fell to 1.9 per cent in December, the lowest annual
increase since 1959, Reuter reports from Stockholm. Economists said the
effective 20 per cent devaluation of the Swedish krona since November 19,
making imports dearer, had not yet worked through to the consumer price
index.
Meanwhile Finnish unemployment rose to a record 18.6 per cent last month,
underlining the severity of the recession, writes Christopher Brown-Humes
from Stockholm. The figure compares with 16.9 per cent for November,
according to the Labour Ministry. The figures will give new urgency to talks
between government and opposition on measures to stimulate the economy.

FT  22 JAN 93 / BA apologises again to Virgin but clears board of blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS last night offered its second, abject apology to Virgin
Atlantic for its 'dirty tricks' campaign against the rival airline but
cleared its own board of any involvement in the damaging affair.
BA announced that it had set up a committee of non-executive directors to
introduce a new code of conduct to be implemented throughout the business.
Lord King, the chairman, said in a statement: 'I would like again to
apologise and to reiterate goodwill towards Richard Branson (Virgin's
chairman).'
Lord King said he also wanted to apologise 'to all our people, our
shareholders and our customers'.
But last night's first indications suggested that Mr Branson was not
satisfied with BA's latest initiative.
Virgin said later it wanted more substantial proposals from BA as the key
issue was 'the serious commercial damage caused to our airline'.
'We will be talking to British Airways at their request over the next week
and will be looking for more concrete proposals than those that emerged
today,' it said in a statement. Ten days ago BA gave an unqualified apology
to Virgin in the High Court and paid libel damages of Pounds 610,000.
In a badly needed boost to morale, BA was also able to announce last night
that it had completed the first phase of a strategic alliance with USAir,
the sixth largest US carrier. BA has paid an initial Dollars 300m (Pounds
197m) for 19.9 per cent of voting interests in the US airline.
The two announcements, aimed at renewing BA's efforts to strike a peace deal
with Virgin and to restore its international standing, came after a
nine-hour board meeting which began at 7.45am at the airline's Heathrow
headquarters. Sir Colin Marshall, the company's chief executive and deputy
chairman, conceded that everybody in the company 'has been touched' by the
affair.
'The code has already gone out to all managers,' Sir Colin said. He said the
board had asked the company's executive management to examine 'specific
areas where problems arose and take appropriate action'.
Sir Colin said he was 'very anxious' to establish an improved relationship
with Virgin. 'We are competitors and will always be competitors, but we need
to establish a much better relationship,' he said.
BA last night said it had received assurances from each board member that
they had not implemented or authorised any 'disreputable business
activities' or any other improper action against Virgin.
The board considered an 80-page investigation into the 'dirty tricks'
campaign requested by non-executive directors and carried out by Linklaters
&amp; Paines, BA's solicitors. The campaign included the luring of passengers
off Virgin and computer tapping.
The document says the covert campaign was confined to a relatively small
number of unconnected incidents which involved a 'very small' number of BA
staff. It also supports the board's consistent claim that there has never
been a wide-ranging conspiracy throughout BA to damage Virgin.
Sir Colin emphasised that the directors 'did not know' and were not involved
in the 'dirty tricks' campaign. 'You have to recognise the size and spread
of the company with 50,000 employees spread over many areas,' he said,
adding that regrettable incidents had occurred in other companies without
perhaps getting the same prominence as the Virgin affair.
Although large US carriers yesterday renewed their lobbying campaign against
BA's alliance with USAir, Sir Colin appeared confident the deal would not be
blocked by the new US administration.
As well as acquiring an initial 19.9 per cent of voting rights in USAir for
Dollars 300m, BA has taken options to invest a further Dollars 450m in the
US carrier, which would lift its equity interest in USAir to 32.4 per cent.
Mr Branson, however, could destabilise BA's partnership with USAir should he
decide to file an anti-trust suit against BA in the US courts.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Major rejects independent role for Bank of England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new governor of the Bank of England is to be told by Mr John Major that
he has rejected calls to reinforce the government's anti-inflation strategy
by granting the Bank independence.
Mr Major has already decided who to appoint and will make an announcement in
the next two weeks. An official said that one of the leading candidates, Sir
David Scholey, chairman of SG Warburg, had been ruled out.
That decision appears to leave Mr Eddie George, deputy governor, as the
front-runner to replace the current governor, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton.
Another possible candidate is Sir David Walker, deputy chairman of Lloyds
Bank.
The new governor will take the post on the understanding that there is no
question in the foreseeable future of the Treasury ceding control of
monetary policy. Downing Street refused last night to comment on when the
new appointee will be named. The most likely date is after Mr Major returns
at the end of next week from a trip to India.
The decision to rule out independence for the Bank will disappoint those in
the City and at Westminster who saw it as a mechanism to underpin
anti-inflation policy following sterling's exit from the European exchange
rate mechanism.
Mr Major has said there is no prospect of Britain rejoining the ERM this
year and that even in the medium term it may prove difficult to relink
sterling to the D-Mark. The commitment in the Maastricht treaty to an
independent bank would apply only if sterling became part of a single
currency.
The prime minister has decided that the political sensitivities of interest
rate changes are too great to transfer responsibility to a body not directly
accountable to the House of Commons.
Some ministers and Conservative MPs support the idea of giving the Bank
statutory authority over monetary policy. But Mr Major's judgment is that
such a transfer would provoke a serious Tory backbench rebellion.
The prime minister has told senior colleagues he does sympathise with the
arguments for the transfer from the Treasury of day-to-day management of
monetary policy. Mr Major was chief secretary to the Treasury when Mr Nigel
Lawson, chancellor at the time, proposed such a move four years ago.
But the political realities of a 21-seat majority, of the recent uproar in
the Tory party over the Maastricht treaty and of the disquiet at Westminster
over economic recovery, point strongly in the opposite direction.
The government believes that comparisons with other European countries miss
the fact that the high level of home ownership in Britain makes changes in
interest rates far more sensitive.

FT  22 JAN 93 / UK unemployment total nears 3m: Industrial production falls
in November - Hopes raised for cut in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, EMMA TUCKER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK UNEMPLOYMENT came within a whisker of the politically sensitive 3m mark
last month, triggering hopes of lower interest rates in the City and furious
exchanges in the Commons.
The government also announced a fall in industrial production in November
while the British Chambers of Commerce said the economy was still in
recession.
The seasonally adjusted jobless total jumped by 60,800 to 2.97m in the month
to December, its 32nd consecutive monthly rise.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, told the Commons that the figures were
'deeply disappointing'. The increase was much higher than the 35,000 rise
predicted in the City and lifted the UK unemployment rate to 10.5 per cent
from November's 10.3 per cent. The actual number of people unemployed
increased by 119,270 to 2.98m.
The unemployment figures prompted a significant change in financial markets'
perception of the pound and encouraged analysts to believe that the
government will soon have to cut bank base rates from 7 per cent.
The pound closed at DM2.4525, down some 2 1/4 pfennigs on the day and 4 3/4
pfennigs lower than at the end of last week. Sterling also fell against the
dollar, closing at Dollars 1.5180, more than 2 1/4 cents down on the day. In
New York, sterling recovered slightly, closing at DM2.4574 and at Dollars
1.5225.
Equities rose on the hopes of lower interest rates with the FT-SE 100 index
gaining 24.6 to 2,773.3. On the domestic money market, three-months' money
dropped by  1/8 per cent to 6 13/16 per cent. This rate, often seen as a
bellwether of future interest rate trends, touched its lowest level since
base rates dropped to 7 per cent in November.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, said the rise in unemployment
was of 'deep concern' to the government.
She said the figures were 'very difficult for both the individuals involved
and for their families'. The government was trying to ensure that existing
measures to help the unemployed were working as effectively as possible.
Unemployment has increased by 1.38m since it began rising in April 1990. The
December increase, which was the biggest monthly rise since July 1991,
brought unemployment back to levels last seen in February 1987.
The Central Statistical Office reported that manufacturing output declined
by 0.5 per cent between October and November and was 0.2 per cent lower than
in November 1991. While reporting an upturn in exports and improved business
confidence, the British Chambers of Commerce yesterday voiced 'extreme
concern' about the state of the domestic UK market and warned of further job
losses to come.
The Treasury did nothing to encourage speculation of lower interest rates.
It said the latest rise in unemployment did not suggest that economic
activity was still falling.
It recalled that the government had eased monetary policy significantly
since September and announced measures in the Autumn Statement aimed at
restoring confidence and encouraging recovery. These had not yet fed through
fully to the production and employment figures.
At Westminster, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, described the figures as
'horrendous' and accused the government of failing the nation. Roared on by
rowdy backbenchers, Mr Smith questioned the credibility of Mr John Major's
expressions of concern and branded as 'feeble and lame' the government's
'excuses'.
'You express concern for the unemployed but aren't you the person who told
us 'If it isn't hurting, it isn't working,'' Mr Smith told the prime
minister.
Mr Major said Labour had 'no idea how to deal with the economy or
unemployment'.
He told a new cabinet sub-committee reviewing possible improvements to
measures to tackle unemployment of a 'dual strategy' to provide long-lasting
solutions. This consisted of a 'solid foundation' for economic recovery and
'wide-ranging' help for the unemployed.

FT  22 JAN 93 / Branson scorns latest olive branch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Branson, Virgin Atlantic's chairman, last night dismissed British
Airways' apologies and assurances that no similar campaign would ever take
place again, writes Michael Cassell.
He remained dissatisfied with BA's efforts to draw the 'dirty tricks' saga
to a swift close. But he is to postpone by one week a decision on whether to
pursue his dispute with BA through the courts.
Mr Branson said the 'key issue' for Virgin was the commercial damage which
had been inflicted upon the airline by BA's undercover activities. He
disclosed that Virgin and BA would be meeting, at BA's request, within the
next few days to establish if there were any grounds for ending the affair.
He said Virgin would then take 'whatever action it feels appropriate' in the
light of the discussions.
Virgin executives will go into the talks expecting BA to provide a detailed
blueprint for improved commercial relationships between the two airlines
but, as importantly, will demand negotiations on cash compensation for the
damage it alleges was inflicted by BA's activities.
The Virgin camp indicated that BA would have to go to considerable lengths
in offering recompense to its competitor if the issue is not to become the
subject of action on alleged anti-trust grounds in the US and possibly in
Europe.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Ilva sells 75 per cent holding in Italian tube group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ILVA, the Italian state-owned steel goup, yesterday announced a further
rationalisation of its operations with the sale of its residual 75 per cent
stake in Tubi Ghisa, a specialist in ductile cast-iron fittings, to France's
Pont-a-Mousson.
The French group, which previously held a 25 per cent of Tubi Ghisa, has
paid cash - the equivalent of L127.5bn (dollars 86.2m). On Ilva's books, the
stake was written in at L20bn.
Apart from ductile cast-iron fittings for pressure pipes, Tubi Ghisa
produces from its Genoa-based plant second-casting foundry work for tubes.
It has 20 per cent of the water-piping market in Italy and this is seen as
an ideal fit for Pont-a-Mousson, a European leader in water supplies. Last
year, Tubi Ghisa returned a L6.3bn profit on sales volume of 106 tonnes and
income of L147bn.
On Monday, Ilva announced its subsidiary Dalmine Tubi Speciali, producing
seamless stainless steel tubes, hoped to cut costs and production via a
three-way venture with subsidiaries of Germany's Mannesmann and Usinor
Sacilor of France. Yesterday, Mr Piero Nardi, Ilva managing director, said
the group planned to raise a further L400bn this year in sell-offs. A
meeting of the Ilva board is due to assess its financial position on Friday,
reported to be heading for a loss in 1992 of around L1,300bn.

joint venture

THE Illinois-based IMC Fertilizer Group and Freeport-McMoRan Resource
Partners have announced a plan to merge their phosphate fertiliser,
phosphate rock and uranium businesses in a venture expected to provide about
Dollars 80m in cost savings to the companies.
The venture, which is subject to US regulatory approval, would be governed
by a committee and operated by IMC Fertilizer. Freeport-McMoRan is the
majority shareholder in Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners.
The deal will divide cost savings evenly, but split profits according to
respective inputs. The combination is expected to provide savings at all
levels of production, from mining to marketing.
Mr Donald Pattison, analyst with C. J. Lawrence, said he expects the joint
venture to consolidate phosphate rock mining operations in Florida, and
close one of two deep water export terminals the companies operate on the
Gulf coast of Florida.
The new venture would represent about 30 per cent of US market share, and be
among the largest such operations in the world.
'One way of looking at it is the joint venture will have about one-half the
amount of Russia's production,' Mr Pattison said. IMC has 23m tons of
phosphate rock capacity per year, while Freeport's is closer to 8.5m tons.
An IMC spokesman estimated annual sales for the venture at Dollars 1bn.
World prices for phosphate fertiliser have fallen to their lowest in 17
years, partly because Russia has been aggressively marketing its phosphate
resources as China and India have weakened their central purchasing of
fertiliser.
The venture will not include IMC Fertilizer's potash, Rainbow, sulphur and
oil and natural gas operations. Freeport-McMoRan Resource will retain its
sulphur and oil and natural gas operations and its geothermal interests.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Eleventh-hour rescue for Expedier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPEDIER, the floundering ticket and box office computer group, announced an
eleventh- hour rescue package yesterday, based on a Pounds 4.5m share
placing, capital restructuring, and management revamp.
The deal will see Expedier, which has been living off extended bank
facilities since 1991, pay Pounds 2.6m for the remaining 50 per cent stake
in its ticket sales joint venture with Wembley, owners of the national
stadium and box office. Wembley will receive 260m shares, equivalent to an
18 per cent stake, while Expedier will take on the joint venture's debts.
Wembley also said yesterday it would not match first half pre-tax profits of
Pounds 2.5m in the second half. The shares fell 2 1/2 p to 17p.
Expedier's new-look business will be renamed The Ticketing Group, owning the
First Call and Keith Prowse ticket agencies, and Space Time Systems, the
computerised box office system (BOCS) supplier. Expedier will issue another
495m shares at 1p each on the basis of 18 new shares for every seven held.
The cash raised will reduce borrowings - which stood at Pounds 10.5m on
December 18 - by Pounds 1m.
Mr Richard Templeton, of advisers Richard Fleming, said Expedier would not
be able to stay in business without a capital injection. The deal amounted
to 'a reconstruction with a severe health warning'.
The group remained highly geared, reliant on another full year of non-demand
facilities provided by its bankers to meet working capital requirements. It
had to meet an outstanding preference dividend payment, and trading
conditions, with sluggish West End ticket sales, were 'uncertain'. Expedier
was yet to sell Medminster, its furniture hire subsidiary.
The rescue package was put together by a consortium including Mr Karl Sydow
and Mr Andrew Myers, directors of the former joint venture, now appointed
deputy chairman and finance director. Mr Clive Ng, a director of
entertainment and real estate companies in the US and Malaysia, provided
finance and joined the board as non-executive director along with Wembley
director Mr Alex McCrindle.
Expedier reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 573,000 (Pounds 1.42m) in
the half-year to June 30 on sharply lower turnover of Pounds 3.38m (Pounds
6.29m).

FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: US upturn helps GE to 6% rise in
final quarter
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric of the US yesterday reported a 6 per cent increase in
fourth-quarter earnings, helped by an improving domestic economy and strong
shipments from its power systems business.
The company made Dollars 1.34bn, compared with Dollars 1.26bn in the same
period of 1991. Earnings per share rose 8 per cent from Dollars 1.46 to
Dollars 1.57, and revenues rose from Dollars 17.6bn to Dollars 17.8bn.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said GE was 'better positioned than ever before,
with a strong balance sheet, very strong cash-flows and excellent prospects
for earnings growth.'
In 1992 overall, GE's earnings rose 7 per cent to Dollars 4.72bn, while its
share repurchase programme helped lift earnings per share 8 per cent to
Dollars 5.51. Revenues rose 3 per cent to Dollars 62.2bn.
GE estimated that earnings from continuing operations - excluding its
aerospace division, being sold to Martin Marietta - would show a rise of
around 10 per cent.
Mr Welch said the company's performance in 1992 had been lead by
double-digit earnings increases at GE Financial Services, Power Systems and
Medical Services.
He added that the year's operating highlight was 'the increasing ability of
the businesses to turn the rhetoric of 'speed' into reality . . . as
demonstrated by record inventory turnover and productivity of nearly 5 per
cent during a period of slow global growth.
'This not only increased earnings but also translated into a record Dollars
5.3bn in operating cash-flow, some Dollars 1.3bn over 1991 results.'
Earnings at GE Financial Services totalled Dollars 1.499bn for the year, 18
per cent up on 1991's Dollars 1.275bn. GE Capital, the main financial
services arm, saw double-digit earnings growth, and Kidder, Peabody, the
securities house, achieved 'sharply improved' results.

FT  21 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Sun Princess to be built by Italy's
Fincantieri yeard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company yesterday announced
that its largest cruise ship yet, the Sun Princess (illustrated above), will
be built by Italy's Fincantieri yard in Monfalcone at a cost of Dollars 300m
(Pounds 197.3m), Richard Tomkins, Transport Correspondent, writes.
The Sun Princess, weighing 77,000 gross tonnes, will carry 1,950 passengers
and 900 crew. It is expected to enter service at the end of 1995 with
Princess Cruises, P&amp;O's Los Angeles-based subsidiary, a leader in the North
American premium cruise market.
The vessel is the third in a row to be built for P&amp;O by Fincantieri. The
others were Crown Princess, delivered in 1990, and Regal Princess, delivered
in 1991. This month Fincantieri won a Dollars 400m-plus order to build the
world's biggest cruise liner for Carnival Cruises of the US.
P&amp;O said the dollar's recent strength and favourable Italian currency rates
had enabled the price of Dollars 300m to be achieved, of which 20 per cent
would be paid during construction and the remainder on delivery. P&amp;O's
worldwide cruise fleet currently comprises 14 ships operating in North
America, Europe and the western Pacific.
Architectural designer of the latest addition is Mr Njal Eide of Norway,
also responsible for the design of P&amp;O's Royal Princess introduced in 1984.
Mr Tim Harris, P&amp;O Cruises chairman, said the design and technical
specification of the latest addition to the fleet would set a new industry
standard taking the company well into the 21st century. 'The Royal Princess
was in many ways the 1980s' classic cruise ship; we believe Sun Princess
will be the classic cruise ship of the 1990s.'

PRICE competition in the previously sheltered Japanese personal computer
market intensified yesterday with the unveiling by IBM Japan and Canon, the
office equipment maker, of a jointly- developed, notebook-style computer
with built-in printer.
Earlier this week, NEC, the Japanese electronics company which has about 53
per cent of the PC market, announced a cheaper model range that was seen as
a response to a fast-increasing flow of lower-priced imports from Compaq and
Dell Computer, the US makers.
At the same time, PC demand is falling in Japan, with sales down an
estimated 15 per cent last year, putting extra pressure on makers to
discount products.
Industrial companies are cutting their capital spending budgets, while
domestic users appear reluctant to trade-in existing models, particularly as
there are expectations of further price cuts later this year.
The IBM-Canon machine, which will have a list price of Y298,000 (Dollars
2,374), has a 32-bit central processing unit and built-in bubble-jet printer
capable of holding 10 sheets of paper.
The companies are hoping for annual sales of about 50,000 units, arguing
that its price compares favourably with that of existing Japanese notebook
PCs.

PRICE competition in the previously-sheltered Japanese personal computer

Earlier this week, NEC, the Japanese electronics company which has about 53

The IBM-Canon machine, which will have a list price of Y298,000 (Dollars

capable of holding 10 sheets of paper.
The companies are hoping for annual sales of about 50,000 units, arguing
that its price compares favourably with that of existing Japanese notebook
PCs.
Japan's computer market was given a shake by Compaq late last year when it
announced the arrival of a Y128,000 model, which was about half the price of
comparable Japanese machines. IBM Japan has since marketed lower-priced
machines, and NEC this week released a desk-top model for Y218,000.
NEC claims its machines are more powerful, offering users value for the
extra money, while the company has its own software.
Japanese retailers, which have traditionally had large margins on NEC
machines, also have room to make further discounts if sales are sluggish.
The Japanese company offers notebook-style computers starting at Y288,000,
which will be under extreme pressure from the foreign competition.
NEC insists it will not be caught in a 'low price, low quality' spiral, but
it is facing a challenge from high-quality imported machines, which come
with suitable Japanese language software.

The proposed merger would create a diversified food and beverages group with
sales of more than Fl 5bn (Dollars 2.7bn) and a strong presence in selected
niches, mainly in European and North American markets, though it would
remain small compared with the other recent link-ups in the foods and
beverage industries.
The companies declined to give any details of the share-swap proposal, apart
from saying that the merger would be on the 'basis of equality'.
Shares in Bols, which is smaller than Wessanen but makes roughly the same
profits, rose strongly on the news, closing up 9.8 per cent at Fl 47.
Wessanen fell Fl 5 to Fl 98.50.
The proposed merger brings together two companies with virtually no
overlapping areas of business. Bols, which has sales of around Fl 1.2bn, is
best known for its liqueurs. It has diversified into wines and non-alcoholic
drinks in order to reduce its dependence on spirits. Nearly 90 per cent of
turnover comes from Europe.
Wessanen, with 1991 sales of Fl 3.9bn, has transformed itself from a
producer of bulk foodstuffs to a group active in branded foods. Around 60
per cent of sales are in the US, where it made a string of acquisitions in
the 1980s in ice creams, yoghurt and other dairy products.

FT  21 JAN 93 / NatWest launches rival to Firstdirect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank is to launch a challenge to Firstdirect, Midland's
telephone banking subsidiary. It is the first attempt by a competitor to
match Firstdirect, which has more than 350,000 customers.
NatWest is planning to extend PrimeLine, a pilot telephone banking service,
to people who do not hold NatWest accounts. They will be offered access to a
personal account manager, as well as a range of banking services.
The bank has been experimenting with telephone banking for 18 months, but
has confined the PrimeLine service to about 9,000 NatWest customers. It
intends at least to double the number of PrimeLine account holders in the
coming year.
Most high street banks are experimenting with telephone banking services to
support branch networks, but none has established a subsidiary like
Firstdirect.
PrimeLine is the closest challenge Firstdirect has faced.
PrimeLine does not offer a 24-hour service: customers can telephone its
centre in Bradford, West Yorkshire between 8am and 10pm on weekdays, and 9am
and 5pm at weekends. But NatWest argues that it offers a wider service than
Firstdirect.
Firstdirect has drawn some 70 per cent of its account holders from outside
Midland.
Mr Larry Cattle, NatWest's head of customer relationships, said the bank had
chosen 'busy professionals' within NatWest as PrimeLine account holders. It
now intended to attract a similar mix of customers from outside.
'Firstdirect has been taking some of our customers, and we think we can
offer something to people who do not yet bank with us,' said Mr Cattle. He
said PrimeLine would probably double or treble its customer base in its next
year.
Mr Cattle said that if customers outside NatWest reacted well to the
PrimeLine service, it was likely to be extended.
He said PrimeLine would not be marketed through national advertising.
Instead, NatWest would probably try direct marketing for its pilot service.
Unlike Firstdirect, which has a separate product range from Midland, NatWest
customers who join PrimeLine are offered standard NatWest products and
services.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Coal and rail union chiefs urge run of strikes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, DAVID OWEN and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the five main coal and rail unions yesterday called on their
members to back a series of one-day strikes in a ballot on March 5. They
plan for the first time to hold simultaneous ballots in what will be the
first campaign of industrial action against privatisation since the mid
1980s.
The move came as the government appeared to have secured European Commission
clearance to provide temporary subsidies for coal beyond existing aid to the
domestic energy sector. Mr Gordon Adam, Labour MEP for Northumbria, said Mr
Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, had indicated at a meeting
with MEPs that it would be permissible for Britain to provide financial
support for coal until 1995.
After 1995, the Commission would seek to apply non-binding guidelines
allowing member states to protect up to 20 per cent of their indigenous
energy sources through subsidies or supply contracts signed with electricity
generators.
The planned 'rolling programme' of one-day strikes in protest at threatened
job losses caused by pit closures and railway privatisation is in marked
contrast to the Trades Union Congress plan for a day of action against job
losses on February 18 which rules out industrial action.
The call for industrial action came as leaders of the breakaway Union of
Democratic Mineworkers - which was not involved in the strike moves  - met
Mr John Major, the prime minister.
Mr Neil Greatrex, the union's president, said Mr Major had told him he would
be directly involved in the review of the coal industry. Mr Greatrex said
the one-hour talk with Mr Major, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, and Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, had 'gone very well'. The UDM
leader said he was told that Mr Heseltine would make a Commons statement to
reassure miners in the 10 pits served last November with 90-day redundancy
notices that the pits would remain open after the end of this month.
Mr Greatrex said Mr Heseltine had added that he would consider extending the
miners' redundancy scheme with an additional Pounds 10,000 top-up which is
due to close at the end of March.
Mr Heseltine also indicated that the white paper setting out the review of
the coal industry would be published as 'soon as possible' next month, Mr
Greatrex said. But the government rejected demands from MPs to commit itself
to extending beyond March the period in which miners accepting voluntary
redundancy would qualify for the enhanced redundancy terms on offer.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said he did not think it would be right to
announce whether there would be an extension in advance of publication of
the results of the government's energy review.
Although industrial action supported by a ballot by the mining and rail
unions would be legal it is not clear for how long the mandate would last. A
'rolling programme' might require more than one ballot to keep the action
legal.
The TUC's action day will involve a lobby of parliament by the unemployed
and leafleting outside Jobcentres. The five unions balloting on strikes are
the Nacods pit supervisors' union, the NUM mineworkers' union, the RMT
transport union, the Aslef train drivers' union and the TSSA railway
clerical workers' union.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Single Market Watch: Border controls raise complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FREE circulation of people within the European Community is being hampered
by systematic passport checks at airports, different national visa
requirements for non-EC travellers and a lack of information about the
single market, according to a lobby group for European citizens. Euro
Citizen Action Service (Ecas) has written to Mr Jacques Delors, president of
the European Commission, after receiving more than 700 calls and about 300
written submissions about border controls on a special fax and telephone
hotline, which operated between January 4 and January 13.
Mr Tony Venables, Ecas director, is now calling on the Commission to take
action to resolve flaws which Ecas claims are undermining the principle of
free movement of people.
In a report*, Ecas says that although systematic passport checks at the EC's
internal land frontiers seem to have ended, all member states are in
infringement of the Single European Act, particularly at airports.
Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the new commissioner for the internal market,
yesterday presented a preliminary report on the progress of the single
market to his fellow commissioners. The report, details of which should be
made public today, refers to delays in lifting internal border controls on
people, but it seems unlikely that Mr Vanni d'Archirafi will seek a legal
confrontation with sluggish member states.
Three EC members, Britain, Ireland and Denmark, are likely to retain
passport controls beyond the end of this year, but even the more
enthusiastic countries are lagging behind in their attempts to abolish all
controls during 1993.
In some cases Ecas believes it has the basis for a formal complaint to the
European Commission. In particular, Ecas received more than 100 complaints
from residents of Gibraltar claiming that Spain had strengthened its
controls on people travelling to and from the British crown colony.

FT  21 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard deflects bid talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKING group Standard Chartered sought to deflect swirling takeover
speculation as its shares outpaced the market to add a net 28 at 630p by the
close of trading.
Gossip mongers had it that Lloyds Bank might be preparing an offer for the
bank that is now benefiting from its exposure to the Pacific rim boom. There
was also alternative talk that Lloyds might have placed a large block of
shares at a premium to the underlying price. However, Standard said the rise
followed a dinner on Tuesday night hosted by the US investment bank Goldman
Sachs. Institutional clients met the bank's chief executive Mr Malcolm
Williamson and apparently left reassured. A bank spokesman said yesterday:
'There has been some buying that was initiated from the sentiment at the
meeting.'
There have been rumours for some time that Lloyds is seeking to make a bid
within the banking sector but most analysts believe it is still licking its
wounds following the failure to acquire Midland. Banking specialists added
that Standard shares were already at a 50 per cent premium to asset value
when trading started yesterday and offered a very expensive way in. Lloyds
closed unchanged at 499p.
Barclays dividend hopes
A 'coincidence of buy recommendations' on Barclays, based on growing
confidence that the bank will hold its dividend, gave a lift to the shares.
The strength was helped by a shortage of stock in early trading and Barclays
rose 19 to 397p on heavy turnover of 8.6m shares.
Hoare Govett, NatWest Securities and agency broker James Capel were all
recommending Barclays yesterday arguing that in spite of anticipated heavy
provisions for bad debts the bank will pay a 21.2p dividend when it
announces full-year results on March 4.
Hoare Govett was advising clients to switch from NatWest saying its share
price was at an unnecessarily big discount to Barclays. However, the general
shift of perception in the sector boosted by news of a recovery in
Citicorp's fortunes ensured that NatWest rose 10 to 415p.
Rank Xerox speculation
Further consideration of this week's restructuring decision by Xerox sent
Rank Organisation sharply forward as speculation mounted over the prospects
for the US group to buy Rank's share of their Rank Xerox joint venture. On
present multiples, Xerox might be expected to pay in excess of Pounds 800m
for the 50 per cent stake, a sum which would go a long way to satisfying
Rank's critics worried over the group's large debt burden of Pounds 999m.
Such concerns have meant Rank has regularly been fingered as a potential
rights issue candidate and undermined the shares performance.
Most analysts cautioned that Xerox's decision to quit the financial services
business would be costly and that any decision on Rank Xerox was some time
off. However, market anxiety about the UK leisure group's debt levels may be
eased by such a prospect on the horizon. Analysts also expressed concern
about the capital gains tax that would be levied on the deal. Rank shares,
helped also by investors buying ahead of the dividend, advanced 13 to 714p
in busy turnover of 1.1m.
Reuters weakened
News wire and electronic dealing group Reuters retreated as investment bank
BZW issued a sell recommendation ahead of the figures on February 9. While
BZW's Mr Paul Norris liked the company's fundamental position, he argued
that revenue growth will only be 5 per cent in the coming year, adding: 'On
our price Reuters is the second most expensive stock in the Footsie after
Rentokil.'
He expects profits of Pounds 380m for 1992 and Pounds 425m for 1993. The
1993 figure is at the low end of the range of analysts' forecasts. Reuters
shares closed 19 lower at 1354p and Mr Norris believes they are not worth
buying until they fall below 1300p.
Insurance group Commercial Union rose 7 as a weighty piece of enthusiastic
research from Smith New Court landed on clients' desks. The 100-page
overview argued that investors were under-estimating the strength of the
life insurance business and the success of CU's UK expansion. Smiths has
raised its 1994 forecast by Pounds 50m to around Pounds 300m and believes
the share price should reach 750p within the next year.
The presentation of new business figures from Legal &amp; General prompted the
shares to rise 10 on the claim that the headline figure had risen by 57 per
cent. However, analysts said that ignoring 'innovative accounting' the
figure was significantly down, and on consideration, the shares fell back to
close only 2 better at 433p.
Drinks stocks constituted the worst performing sector in the market as a
worrying trading statement and technical factors combined to depress shares.
Bear raiders were in evidence again in Allied Lyons as rights issue stories
re-surfaced. Although the stories were discounted by the company, the shares
lost ground, closing 12 adrift at 590p.
A pessimistic trading statement from Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley took 5 off the
shares to 565p and pulled Whitbread back sharply, off 12 at 452p. Regional
brewers were also weakened by government hints that rules on licence
applications would be relaxed, opening the prospect of more competition.
After its recent mauling, Bass recovered on late betting considerations and
advanced 3 to 582p.
Global advertising and marketing services group WPP saw its share price jump
10 per cent after SG Warburg Securities published a comprehensive buy note
on the stock. The analysis argues that the shares are trading on a multiple
of only 10.3 times 1993 earnings compared with a sector rating of almost 15
times. On this basis, the house believes the shares would be more fairly
valued at 87p. Yesterday they lifted 6 to 66p.
Vodafone rose following reports that the cellular market may be undermined
by lower-priced mobile rivals. The shares tumbled 19 to 388p in bulky
turnover of 6.8m.
Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo fell further on talk that it might be interested
in a bid for US group Warner Lambert. However, the shares recovered with the
market to close a penny better at 702p.
Initial disappointment at yesterday's retail sales figures evaporated as the
details revealed better news from the larger high street stores. Argos rose
14 to 279p, Body Shop 1 to 144p, Dixons 8 to 233p and Marks and Spencer 5 to
317p.
Positive news leaked from an analysts visit to Unigate and the shares gained
6 to 330p. Unilever continued to benefit from its upbeat trading message to
analysts this week and the shares added 8 to 1096p.
Disappointing results from Resort Hotels left the shares 2 shy at 40p.
Betting stocks benefited again from the government's decision to allow late
summer opening hours. Brent Walker added 1 3/4 to 10 1/2 p, Ladbroke 4 to
189p and Stanley Leisure a muted 3 to 177p. A profits warning from Wembley
sent the shares 2 1/2 lower at 17p.
The market continued to be cheered by confirmation of the Taiwan Aerospace
deal with British Aerospace and the shares broke through the 200p barrier to
close up 8 at 202p, in trade of 6m.
Among other engineering stocks, IMI gave up 2 to 252p following a Smith New
Court sell recommendation. Smith said the advice was because, 'the rate of
growth at the company will be below the average for the engineering sector
in 1993.'
The market continued to appreciate plans by British Steel to raise prices on
some of its main products. The shares added 4 to 64 1/2 p, in brisk business
of 10m which included a trade of 3m done at 62 1/2 , with a sizeable part of
the demand said to have come from the US.
Investors took a court ruling in the US concerning asbestos claims to be
good news for T &amp; N. The shares gained 5 to 177p, with sentiment boosted by
a buy recommendation from Carr Kitcat. The agency broker advised investors
to switch into T &amp; N and GKN, 2 better at 255p, and out of BBA and Laird
Group, a penny off at 158p and 2 lighter at 291p respectively.

FT  21 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Volatile market closes at day's high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK equity market put on one of its more bewildering performances
yesterday, moving going through a 21-point range, before rising strongly
late in the session.
Poor official retail sales figures for December were followed up by hopes
that a faltering economic recovery could trigger a further cut in UK
interest rates.
A relatively good showing by gilts, which ended with gains of half a point
at the long end, was a further encouragement to the equity market.
Dealers also took heart from the trend in the Footsie future, which dipped
below a crucial support level at 2,740 but suddenly reversed and raced up,
taking the cash market with it and closing at a modest premium.
Worries of a sizeable rights issue hitting the market proved wide of the
mark but there a strong conviction remained that a big cash-raising
operation, possibly the first of many, was being prepared.
Share prices gave ground at the opening of business, still pressured by
rights issue worries, but quickly recovered their initial losses in the
absence of the much-rumoured cash call, helped by a small programme trade
said to be weighted on the buy side.
More selling developed in mid-morning but was well absorbed by the market
which moved into positive territory during the lunchtime period before
stalling and then closing with a flourish of strong support, mostly prompted
by the Footsie future.
The erratic performance of the market was illustrated by the FT-SE 100 which
touched the day's low of 2,727.6, down 10 points, within two hours of the
opening and closed at the day's high of 2,748.7, for a net gain of 11.1. The
Footsie Mid 250 closed 4 higher at 2,889.9, having been down some 8 points
in mid-morning.
After a slow start, volume in equities picked up markedly finishing at
599.3m shares, compared with Tuesday's 557m and Monday's 488m.
After dropping to Pounds 899m on Monday, the value of equity business in the
market on Tuesday once again topped Pounds 1bn to reach Pounds 1.1bn.
There was widespread initial dismay at the retail sales figure for December,
which showed a 0.7 per cent month-on-month decline, against forecasts of a
rise of between 0.2 and 0.4 per cent.
Dealers chopped share prices as the news appeared but the weakness,
especially in the big retailers, was short-lived after the central
statistics office said overall sales for the big retailers were up seven per
cent and the small retailers down five per cent.
Marks &amp; Spencer shares, initially weakened by the news, quickly rallied and
ended the day on a firm note.
Big dollar earners were boosted by the weakness of sterling, with SmithKline
Beecham aggressively bought.
Bank shares provided two of the market's best performing FT-SE 100 stocks in
Standard Chartered and Barclays, the former lifted by diminished fears of a
right issue and buy recommendations from a couple of brokers, while the
latter gained ground as the dividend debate swung in favour of those
suggesting the payment will be held.
Today's FT-Actuaries All-Share Index includes a gross dividend for HSBC
Holdings instead of the net dividend previously applied. The new total
dividend amount is 18.93p up from 14.2p.

FT  21 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures once again had a volatile session as they reacted to a
poor set of retail figures and speculation of a cut in base rates, writes
Joel Kibazo.
Early selling of the March contract on the FT-SE, which had began trading at
2,748, said to have come from two leading US houses, was much in evidence
and the contract responded by falling to 2,740. The late morning release of
December retail figures pushed March lower, down to the day's low of 2,735.
However, bargain hunting and speculation of a cut in interest rates revived
the fortunes of March. Together with the steady performance of short
sterling, it helped pull the underlying cash market forward. It reached the
day's peak of 2,761 just ahead of the close.
The March contract closed at 2,759, up 14 on Tuesday's close and 3 ahead of
its fair value premium to cash of about 8. Turnover improved to reach 9,845.
Traded options experienced moderate activity with turnover totalling 24,734
lots. Business in the FT-SE 100 option was poor and volume was a mere 6,381
lots and that of the Euro FT-SE 706 contracts. Hanson was the most active,
and it traded 2,219 lots with the February 220 calls the busiest series. It
was followed by British Steel at 1,706, and by BTR at 1,395 contracts. Glaxo
and National Power were also busy.

FT  21 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US blue chips plunge in late
selling burst
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
AFTER MOVING in a narrow trading range for most of the session, a late burst
of selling left blue chip issues markedly lower at the end of trading
yesterday, although secondary stocks held their ground, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 14.04 at 3,241.95,
the bulk of the decline coming in the final 30 minutes of trading. The more
broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended down 1.78 at 433.35, while the Amex
composite firmed 1.37 to 405.21, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.63 at
697.44. Trading volume on the NYSE was 269m shares, and declines outnumbered
rises by 972 to 882.
There were no new economic statistics released yesterday, which meant that
the market's attention was primarily focused on the inauguration of
President Bill Clinton.
Some analysts had been nervous that the market might react negatively if the
new president referred to substantial economic stimuli in his speech; but,
in the event, Mr Clinton avoided specific references to economic policy and
the speech passed with no significant reaction from inves tors.
The news that the Iraqi government had made conciliatory offers to the
incoming administration aided market senti ment, primarily because it led to
a drop in crude oil prices on world commodity markets.
Drug stocks, which have languished lately, were in strong demand. US
Surgical was the highlight, rising Dollars 7 1/4 to Dollars 75 7/8 in volume
of 2m shares as investors reacted positively to the news, released late on
Tuesday, that the company earned a profit of 64 cents a share in the fourth
quarter, up from 48 cents a share a year ago.
Also firmer were Pfizer, Dollars 2 1/2 higher at Dollars 63 1/2 ,
Schering-Plough, up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 57 5/8 , Merck, up Dollars  5/8
at Dollars 41 1/4 , and Johnson&amp;Johnson, up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 45 3/4 .
Tenneco fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 40 in busy trading on the news that Mr
Michael Walsh, the conglomerate's chairman and chief executive, has been
diagnosed as having a brain tumour. Mr Walsh said that he would continue to
work while being treated with radiation and chemotherapy.
Among computer stocks, Unisys climbed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 12 1/2 after
the company unveiled fourth quarter income before extraordinary items of
Dollars 101.2m, up sharply from the Dollars 80.5m earned at the same stage
of 1991. Also firmer was Digital Equipment, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 41 5/8 .
IBM, however remained under selling pressure following the announcement on
Tuesday of a record annual loss, and fell another Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
46 7/8 .
AMR, parent group of American Airlines, fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 67 1/8
after announcing a fourth quarter net loss of Dollars 200m. Canada
TORONTO stocks were mixed overall, despite rallying gold shares. The
300-stock composite index added 2.06 points, or 0.06 per cent, to 3,290.14,
with declining issues ahead of advances 320 to 277. Volume was 44.96m shares
worth CDollars 370m compared with Tuesday's 55.46m shares worth CDollars
544m.
Ten of 14 sub-groups ended lower. The gold sector showed the largest swing,
up 3.7 per cent.

FT  21 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris lower on 5 per cent fall
in Lyonnaise-Dumez
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES saw mixed performances yesterday.
PARIS featured Lyonnaise-Dumez which was suspended after the shares had
fallen more than 5 per cent, down FFr25.30 at FFr435.50, before forecasting
disappointing 1992 earnings. The group, which was meeting analysts last
night, also said that it would be setting aside large provisions.
The CAC-40 index closed 18.90 lower at 1,818.82 in good turnover of
FFr3.1bn.
Sanofi and YSL, which both resumed trading having been suspended since
Monday, reacted to the announcement that Sanofi was to absorb the latter in
a share exchange of four of its shares to every five of YSL. Sanofi lost
FFr117 or 10.7 per cent to FFr970 while YSL rose FFr133 or 21 per cent to
FFr763.
Saint-Gobain declined FFr12 to FFr489 ahead of its 1992 earnings today.
FRANKFURT pondered the Bonn government's tax proposals, including the
resumption and doubling of the solidarity tax surcharge, as well as a DM10bn
increase in the forecast German budget deficit for 1993. It was a measure of
the recent strength in equities, said dealers, that the DAX index fell only
3.95 to 1,574.88.
Turnover eased from DM6.3bn to DM6.2bn. Waning hopes of an interest rate cut
from the Bundesbank today had little effect on equities, as the rumours came
from the UK and were not accompanied by significant buying orders.
Individual shares were mixed. Deutsche Bank closed down DM6.80 at DM645,
under pressure from a large sell order; but Hoechst extended its relative
strength against BASF and Bayer with a DM3.70 gain to DM255.90.
MADRID was boosted by a cut in yields on three-month and six-month Treasury
bills and the general index closed 4.50, or 2 per cent higher at 234.07 in
heavy turnover of around Pta28bn.
The cuts encouraged expectations of an imminent easing in Spanish interest
rates and fuelled buying in interest rate-sensitive stocks: in utilities,
Iberdrola II led with a gain of Pta33 to Pta625; and in banks, BBV up Pta80
to Pta2,815.
However, there were also strong gains elsewhere, across the board in
construction where Uralita put on Pta83 to Pta756; and selectively, but
spectacularly, in chemicals where Argonesas rose Pta95 to Pta900.
AMSTERDAM featured Wessanen and Bols after they announced merger plans, with
the former losing Fl 5.00 to Fl 98.50 and the latter gaining Fl 4.20 to Fl
47.00. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.6 higher at 98.9.
Elsewhere, publishers were mixed with Wolters Kluwer slipping 10 cents to Fl
87.30 and Elsevier losing 80 cents to Fl 122.90. VNU gained Fl 1.20 to Fl
122.90. Philips added 20 cents to Fl 22.80.
MILAN pulled up from early lows in steady trade. The burst of activity by
small investors early in the week after a package of bourse-boosting
measures was unveiled had mostly died down. The Comit index dipped 2.62 to
485.34.
Fiat had a mixed performance, closing down L111 at L4,378 but turning up in
after-hours trading to L4,500.
Other leading shares echoed Fiat. Agro-industrial and chemical group
Montedison fell L20 to L1,277 but moved up to L1,313 in late trading and
insurer Generali fell L730 to L32,430 but picked up to L33,200 in the after
market.
Fondiaria advanced by L855 to L28,885 and continued up to L28,964 after
hours following a report, denied by the company, that it planned to sell
subsidiaries to cut debt and that GAIC, the majority shareholder jointly run
by Ferruzzi and Camillo De Benedetti, the Italian financier, wanted to cede
control.
ZURICH ended little changed with the SMI index easing 1.2 to 2,062.7.
Roche certificates picked up SFr10 to SFr4,130 in active trade after
Tuesday's SFr110 fall which followed a report that minute particles of
asbestos had been found during analysis of two of the company's drugs.
Watchmaker SMH's registered shares fell SFr25 to SFr1,545 after Tuesday's
SFr20 advance as investors gave further consideration to Volkswagen's
decision to pull out of a joint venture to produce an environment-friendly
city car.
Oerlikon-Buehrle's bearers fell SFr5 to SFr410 as its announcement that it
will make a small group consolidated profit for 1992 after the previous
year's loss came as little surprise.
BRUSSELS saw gains in blue chips lift the Bel-20 index 5.07 to 1,150.74 as
Tractebel moved ahead for the second straight day with a rise of BFr120 to
BFr8,130.
STOCKHOLM was disappointed that the central bank had not cut interest rates
and the Affarsvarlden index lost 1.7 to 933.1 in turnover of some SKr576m.
Among the banks Handelsbanken dropped SKr1.50 to SKr40.50 while, elsewhere,
Ericsson fell SKr1 to SKr185.
COPENHAGEN shares continued higher helped by a strong bond market and the
prospect of political stability when a new Social Democrat-led
administration is formed later in the week. The KFX index closed 0.61 higher
at 81.77.
VIENNA featured a Sch35 rise in Austrian Airlines to Sch1,490 adding to its
gains on Tuesday while the ATX index rose 0.46 to 731.1.

FT  21 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Currency policies affect European
turnover - Italy and Spain put in good second half performances writes
William Cochrane, reviewing 1992 trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a pattern which begins with optimism and ends in disappointment, European
bourses seem to be getting into the habit of producing better turnover
figures in the first half of a given year than they do in the second.
This was the way in 1990, and again in 1991; and the same can be said for
last year in aggregate, although there were distinct variations in
individual countries.
The variations, however, make up a pattern of their own. The countries which
did worse in the second half of 1992 than they did in the first included
Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, all supporting
hard currency policies. Those which did better were Italy, Spain and the UK,
all of which devalued during the second half of last year.
Mr James Cornish, European market strategist with NatWest Securities, which
produces the figures, observes that it was a good year in toto. UK turnover
rose by 20.4 per cent over 1991 as the devaluation effect combined with the
perception that the UK, like the US, was entering economic recovery earlier
than the rest of Europe.
Nearly all of the rest put up useful increases: France 8.4 per cent; Germany
6.4 per cent; Italy 8.8 per cent; the Netherlands 9.5 per cent; and
Switzerland 6 per cent; with only Spain of the eight countries covered
showing a decline, of 7 per cent.
Occasionally, some countries had an exciting time. France enjoyed itself, in
stock market turnover terms, in June, September and December:
in June following the Danish 'No' vote on the Maastricht treaty, and
President Francois Mitterrand's decision to call an autumn referendum on the
same subject;
in September, along with most of Europe, on the partial collapse of the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism, following a fall in the dollar at the
beginning of the month, the thin 'Yes' majority in the French referendum and
resulting devaluations and currency floats;
and, last month, as devaluation speculation against the franc combined with
renewed critical appreciation of the French economy and the Paris equity
market.
Germany had already had a stab at reflecting a decaying growth rate in the
second half of 1991. Last year, it cranked itself up in January on hopes of
interest rate cuts; but as those hopes effectively decayed, and the German
economy moved into the prospect of recession, its equity market turnover
showed a downward trend through most of 1992.
Mr Cornish observes that most of the investment into German paper was going
elsewhere, into the bond market. The Bundesbank's tight grip on the monetary
tiller was accompanied by figures for net foreign investment in German fixed
interest stocks rising from DM5.5bn in the first quarter of 1992, through
DM8.1bn in the second and DM17.8bn in the third, to DM28.9bn in
October/December.
Italy positively mushroomed in October and November, as the devaluation
effect combined with excitement stirred up by the privatisation prospect for
a number of government-controlled companies.
Spain, with another strong final quarter performance, combined a small
devaluation with a strong post-devaluation performance in the currency
markets.
Switzerland, finally, was the Continental performance market of the year, as
long term economic improvement weighed in the scales with its reputation as
a safe haven - and its capacity to reflect this as an equity market with a
preponderance of defensive stocks.

FT  21 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average declines
on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average fell for the first time in three trading days on
profit-taking by dealers and liquidation of specified money trusts by
corporate investors writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average fell 288.46 to 16,510.18, losing over 130 points in
the last hour of trading. The index slid from the day's high of 16,841.78 in
early trading on a weaker futures market, hitting a low of 16,507.37 just
before the close.
Volume totaled 200m shares against 202m with declines outnumbering advances
by 566 to 327 with 206 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 9.99 to 1,266.08 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
rose 0.46 to 1,033.38.
Investors ignored calls for an urgent need for a discount rate cut by Mr
Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, a leading member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Policy makers and financial authorities have become increasingly nervous
about possible turmoil in the market ahead of the March year-end book
closing.
Dealers sold shares bought on short-term trading. Isuzu Motors, the day's
most active issue, lost all of its morning gains, falling Y10 to Y348. A
recent upgrading by Nomura Research Institute encouraged active trading, but
profit-taking later set in. Minebea, the ball-bearings company, fell Y5 to
Y468 in spite of reports of an earnings recovery forecast due to an increase
in demand for ball-bearings.
Japan Airlines fell Y13 to Y571 after announcing that it will suspend its
dividend payment for the year to March for the first time in six years. JAL
saw a sharp decline in passengers on international lines and projects a net
loss of Y40bn.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 40.72 to 18,102.79 in volume of 42.6m shares.
Roundup
Some bright spots emerged among the regions markets.
AUSTRALIA closed higher led by encouraging company results and strong
futures buying.
After a dull morning, the market kicked upwards after the release of
improved interim profit results by MIM Holdings, 3 cents higher at ADollars
2.32, and takeover target Arnotts. which closed steady at ADollars 9.52, 2
cents above Campbell Soup's latest takeover offer.
The All Ordinaries index rose 2.7 to 1,521.8, after a low of 1,510.6.
HONG KONG was weaker as shrinking buying interest failed to outweigh mild
profit-taking in thin turnover of HKDollars 2.48bn. The Hang Seng index lost
20.88 to 5,877.02.
While a pre-holiday mood prevails in the market, which closes on Friday for
four days for the Lunar New Year, the Sino-British row over Hong Kong is
also helping to discourage buying interest at current levels.
Among other actives, Cheung Kong gained 30 cents to HKDollars 20.20, while
HSBC Holdings was unchanged at HKDollars 60.
SINGAPORE shrugged off overnight losses to end higher in thin volume.
The Straits Times Industrial index rose 5.14 to 1,578.16 in thin volume of
45.5m shares against Tuesday's 67.11m. Falls led gains by 92 to 104.
Inchcape rose 30 cents to SDollars 6.85 and Singapore Press Foreign rose 30
cents to SDollars 16.60.
KUALA LUMPUR closed mixed with the market lacking a clear direction.
Investors also remained cautious about building up positions due to the
constitutional crisis over efforts to strip the country's hereditary rulers
of their legal immunity.
The composite index closed down 1.51 at 622.61 in volume of 54.5m shares
compared with Tuesday's 65.6m.
BANGKOK investors turned attention to banks and finance stocks and the SET
index rose 12.43 to 961.30 on big turnover of Bt9.94bn.
MANILA was higher with the composite index 26.69 ahead at at 1,309.68.
Philippine Long Distance Telephone added 35 pesos to 860 pesos in an active
trading.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Worries over Solidarity Pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR remained under pressure against the D-Mark yesterday, falling to
DM1.60 in European trading, as the markets ruled out any chance of a policy
easing by the Bundesbank today, writes James Blitz.
Speculation of a cut in official German rates at today's council meeting was
all but killed after the Bundesbank conducted a neutral weekly intervention
in the German money market.
The Bundesbank imperceptibly eased the lowest accepted tender for 14-day
funds to 8.59 per cent, and drained liquidity from the market.
Prospects for a narrowing of the differential between short-term German and
US rates were further dampened as German trade unions criticised the Bonn
government's 'federal consolidation programme' launched yesterday.
The plan is one of the most ambitious attempts to rein back social spending
and industrial subsidies in Germany since the war. But the German Trade
Union, DGB, said yesterday that it would not support a solidarity pact which
contained the government's proposals. Agreement on the pact is seen as a
crucial precursor to aggressive interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank.
A sign of the dollar's weakness was that it closed down nearly  1/2 a
pfennig against the D-Mark in London, at DM1.6065, despite the German
currency's weakness against the Japanese yen in Asian trading the night
before. The yen closed at Y77.8 against the D-Mark from a previous close of
Y77.96.
In European exchange rate mechanism trading, the German currency continued
to weaken against the French franc, which closed at FFr3.3800 to the D-Mark,
some 5 pfennigs above its ERM floor.
If any source of uncertainty over the French currency remains, it is the
high level of money market rates, with three month money rising yesterday to
11 15/16 per cent.
However, Mr Michael Gallagher, Director of Economic Research at IDEA, the
business information group, said that the Bank of France was deliberately
keeping money market rates high as it sells French francs in an attempt to
build up foreign currency reserves. A similar operation is thought to have
been conducted for 3 weeks after the September French franc crisis.
Attempts by European central banks to replenish their reserves with D-Marks
may even keep the German currency underpinned against the dollar for some
time yet. According to Mr Gallagher, the Bundesbank's monthly report
suggested that Frankfurt is still owed some DM60bn by European central banks
in return for its interventions during the currency crisis.
Sterling lost exactly 2 pfennigs against the D-Mark, closing at DM2.4750,
after the December retail sales figures in the UK dropped 0.7 per cent on
the month, a figure that was far worse than expected.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Sterling futures rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a more bullish tone to sterling futures yesterday after a
poorer-than-expected set of retail sales figures for December raised new
hopes of a cut in UK base rates, writes James Blitz.
The UK's retail sales figure fell by 0.7 per cent after the market had been
expecting sales to rise by 0.5 per cent on the month.
Although the Chancellor has hinted that there will be no near-term cuts in
UK base rates, the market believes that there is a strong chance of at least
50 basis points being taken off rates at the time of the March budget, which
happens to fall one day before the maturity of the March short sterling
contract.
The contract therefore rallied 10 basis points on the day, to close at
93.52, on hopes that anew stimulus to the economy will be needed.
At this level, it assumes that 3-month money in the spring will be at 6.48
per cent.
One dealer assumed that a  1/2 percentage point cut in base rates would
bring 3-month money down to 6 5/8 per cent, making this compatible with the
price of the March contract.
Conditions in the sterling cash market were a good deal stickier, partly due
to another large shortage forecast by the Bank of England, this time to the
tune of Pounds 1.1bn. Dealers again appeared to be short of bills to offer
the Bank, and there was late assistance of Pounds 380m. Three month money
closed a touch firmer at around 6 15/16 per cent.
The bullishness in sterling markets was the exact opposite of sentiment in
Europe. Three month French francs again firmed to 11 15/16 per cent from a
previous close of 11 3/4 per cent. The March French franc contract also
suffered another big setback, with the March contract falling 15 basis
points to close at 90.14. The March Euromark contract was also off some 4
basis points to close at 92.07 at the end of the day.
The duller sentiment mystified some dealers, partly because the prospect for
near-term official rate cuts in Germany seems much stronger than it was a
week ago.
The Bundesbank may have dampened sentiment yesterday by its neutral
intervention in the German money market, offering funds at a barely
unchanged rate of 8.59 per cent and draining a small DM400m from the market.
Only a minority of dealers expects a policy ease at today's Bundesbank
council meeting.

FT  21 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian market picked up fractionally at the end of last week and has
moved a little higher again so far this week. The Wool Corporation's market
indicator, which ended before Christmas at 509c, slipped to 500 before
recovering on January 20 to 509c again. These tiny changes were accompanied
by an improved clearance to the trade, with only 7% passed in on January 20
compared with 25% on the uncertain first day. It is difficult to find any
response in the amount of trade processing and manufacturing sectors around
the world.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: North Sea oil dips below
Dollars 17
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH SEA oil prices dipped below Dollars 17 per barrel for the first time
in a week yesterday following a sharp drop in the New York market on Tuesday
night. London and New York prices were depressed yesterday with North Sea
Brent crude prices for March delivery touching Dollars 16.95 a barrel.
The March futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 19
cents to Dollars 18.51 per barrel in mid-day trading.
The fall of more than 50 cents a barrel in the New York futures market on
Tuesday night followed the release of a weekly report on oil stocks by the
American Petroleum Institute. The API reported a rise in crude stocks of
7.8m barrels in the previous week, with gasoline inventories increasing by
6m barrels.
The stock figures unnerved the market as they came out higher than analysts'
expectations. Crude oil stocks rose as imports continued to build up at Gulf
of Mexico terminals, but demand remained sluggish and US refineries cut
their production runs to just under 85 per cent capacity utilisation.
Another factor that sent prices falling was the ceasefire mooted by Saddam
Hussein, Iraq's leader, on Tuesday. Crude prices have increased slightly on
the back of tension in the Middle East even though Iraq does not export oil
at present.
In the North Sea, the Sullom Voe loading terminal remained closed because of
high winds. Storage tanks at the terminal and at Chevron's Ninian platform
are almost full, meaning production could be cut. These problems have had
little effect on the oil price.
The oil products market is still extremely weak as the weather remains mild
in Europe and North America, depressing demand. Gas oil prices moved Dollars
2 a tonne lower on the Rotterdam market yesterday to Dollars 156 a tonne.
The crude market remains over-supplied with oil as demand is low and traders
are still looking to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for
leadership in cutting output.
'Clearly for this market to turn around, we've got to get something out of
Opec and not just pledges, but action,' said Mr Andrew LeBow at ED &amp; F. Man,
the international trading house, in New York.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Subsidy cut highlights the ups
and downs of hill sheep farming - How the phasing out of the Hill Livestock
Compensatory Allowance will affect the Lake District
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S HILL sheep farmers are up in arms over the Ministry of
Agriculture's decision to cut one of the mainstays of their income - the
Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowance.
The National Farmers' Union has described the Pounds 2.25 reduction in HLCAs
for breeding ewes to Pounds 6.50 as an arbitrary step that will inflict a
crippling blow on a hard-pressed sector of the agricultural industry.
The ministry has strongly defended the move, which is part of the switch
towards a uniform system of subsidies within the European Community's single
market. UK hill farm incomes were up 66 per cent in 1991-92, and were
expected to rise further this year, said one official. The ministry is
forecasting an average cash income of Pounds 18,600 for hill sheep farmers
in 1992-93, compared with Pounds 10,900 in 1990-91.
At an angry meeting at the Newfield Inn, Seathwaite, in the Duddon Valley
earlier this month, Lake District hill farmers argued that while incomes
were up, they had risen from a very low base. 'What's 66 per cent of
nothing? 1991 was about the worst year - we have certainly not got back to
1984 figures,' one said.
Hill sheep farms rely heavily on subsidies, and the HLCA system - funded 25
per cent by the EC and 75 per cent by the UK government - was designed
specifically to keep people farming on the hills. Government statistics show
that fewer people are leaving the hills than are leaving agriculture in
other parts of the country - but hill farmers question whether this will
remain the case.
Farmers are notoriously tight-lipped about their accounts. But Mr Maurice
Hall, who runs nearly 1,300 sheep at Stowgill Farm, near Kaber in Cumbria,
was willing to open his books to show the effect of the cut. His total
income per ewe in 1992 was Pounds 41.24, made up as follows: HLCA Pounds
8.75, sheep annual premium (the EC support) Pounds 18.79, sale of lambs
Pounds 10 and sale of ewes Pounds 3.70. Both the last two payments are
averaged out per ewe.
He does not include wool sales in the accounts, as the amount received
merely covers the cost of shearing.
Variable costs per ewe, including feed, veterinary charges and
over-wintering costs came to Pounds 14.90, leaving a gross margin of Pounds
26.35 per ewe. He has set the farm up as a company with a partner, and last
year paid himself a wage of Pounds 6,000. Total fixed costs are roughly
Pounds 20 a ewe, leaving Pounds 6.50. . . 'out of which I have to pay the
mortgage'.
The cut in this year's HLCA will take nearly Pounds 3,000 off the budgeted
income that he presented to his bank last September. He admitted that some
of this would be made up by increases in the sheep annual premium, but he
felt that the Government action suggested that if the hill farmers reached
profitability, the money would be cut.
'I have made no money for reinvestment in the last three years,' he said. 'I
have not bought anything - not even second hand.'
The ministry believes the hill farmers have not yet fully grasped the
increased benefits that will be coming their way through the EC sheep annual
premium, which one official said would give a gross margin of Pounds 30 per
ewe. The increases follow sterling's depreciation after its withdrawal from
the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September.
Before last September the sheep annual premium was Pounds 14.61, plus a
Pounds 4.37 supplement for less favoured areas (LFAs) - a category which
covers most of the upland farming land in the UK. Since then the payments
have risen to Pounds 17.25 and Pounds 5.78 respectively, a total increase of
Pounds 4.05 - which more than offsets the cut in HLCAs. Premium payments are
limited to the number of sheep being kept on each farm in 1991.
Mr John Gummer, the agriculture minister, told Devon NFU earlier this month,
that the higher annual premiums and increased LFA supplement, together with
the rise in hill farm incomes last year, were worth an estimated Pounds 80m
to Pounds 90m while the cut in HLCAs would take back only Pounds 20m.
The increase in sheep annual premium has failed to impress the Lake District
hill farmers, however. In the Penrith area a petition protesting against the
HLCA cuts has been signed by nearly 800 local people and 30 farmers will be
bringing it to the Houses of Parliament next week to join other NFU farmers
from all over the country who want MPs to reverse the decision.
Mr David Ellwood, a National Trust tenant with 1,000 ewes in the Duddon
valley, was one of 12 who tendered in 1988 for Baskell Farm, built in 1885,
the type of farm a tourist would expect to find on National Trust property.
He moved there with his wife and children from his father's farm Eskdale,
where he was born and brought up but which could no longer provide them with
a living.
He is puzzled that the government income statistics show hill farm incomes
rising, pointing out that his lambs were selling for Pounds 13 to Pounds 14
apiece in his first year, but made only Pounds 11 in 1992.
'Even before the cuts it was hard enough to make a living here,' he said.
'Gummer should come up and see how we actually live in the hills.'
In the Newfield Inn the farmers said it was their work that kept the Lake
District attractive to tourists, who bring Pounds 290m a year into the local
economy. The boost from tourists also kept the village shops going. They
feared that any reduction in their income would start a vicious circle of
decline, with land reverting to scrub, dry stone walls going unrepaired,
shops closing and villages becoming depopulated.
'What would be the cost of maintaining the countryside if the sheep were not
there?' asked one.

Robusta COFFEE futures yesterday resumed the downtrend that had been
interrupted on Tuesday, with the March position at the London Futures and
Options Exchange ending the day Dollars 58 down at Dollars 910 a tonne. The
trend was again set in the New York market, where investment fund selling
pushed prices through successively lower support levels. 'There's a lot of
extra fund money out there. . . which is why we're getting the violent
movements we haven't seen since the 1980s,' one trader said. COCOA prices
were also weaker, on trade profit-taking and light producer selling, and the
May position closed at Dollars 732 a tonne, down Dollars 4. Trading remained
quiet at the London Metal Exchange, where the strongest performance was the
cash TIN price's Dollars 49 rise to Dollars 5,940 a tonne. That was the
fifth successive daily gain and took the rise over the past week to more
than Dollars 110 a tonne. Dealers attributed the continued rise chiefly to
technical considerations. ALUMINIUM prices weakened further under
speculative selling pressure.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Industry urges CIS aluminium
quota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN aluminium industry is appealing to national governments for
stringent quotas to be imposed on aluminium imports from the Commonwealth of
Independent States. The industry says it operates at a loss and its
viability is 'seriously endangered'.
Producers in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK want their governments
to press the European Commission to restrict CIS aluminium imports to the
European Community to 82,000 tonnes a year, compared with the estimated
600,000 tonnes that flooded the EC in 1992 and 450,000 tonnes the previous
year.
'If this problem is not dealt with very quickly it will solve itself - all
the European smelters will have closed down,' said one industry official
yesterday.
The producers say 82,000 tonnes was the average annual tonnage imported to
all western markets during the last three 'normal' years before the
'dramatic and unexpected increase in aluminium exports from the former
Soviet Union since 1990'.
They want quotas to cover new and secondary (scrap) aluminium to close a
loophole being used by some traders who export new metal from the CIS but
call it 'scrap'. Producers say this competes directly with new metal.
In documents presented to governments, they say that, because the EC is the
closest large consuming area to the CIS, it is bearing the brunt of
aluminium exports from that region. Those exports were recently estimated by
the CIS industry to have reached more than 1.2m tonnes last year.
The European producers suggest CIS imports have depressed aluminium prices
on the London Metal Exchange - the most widely-used guide to world prices -
and forced the European industry to make costly production cuts.
Europe accounts for about 25 per cent of world aluminium supply but 80 per
cent of the 1.1m tonnes of capacity has been shut down, either temporarily
or permanently, because of low prices in the region. Earlier this week
Alusuisse-Lonza announced the permanent closure of its smelter in the Valais
canton of Switzerland, while Inespal said it was discussing with its unions
substantial permanent output cuts at two smelters in Spain.
The European producers complain of 'the total lack of official statistics or
reliable information regarding the activities of the former Soviet aluminium
industry' and say 'the disorganisation of the CIS exporting structures is
further aggravating the situation'.
They suggest quotas should stay in place until the CIS stimulates a revival
of its domestic market and/or adjusts its sales and pricing policies 'to
market economy rules and mechanisms'.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: SA platinum mine opens to
chorus of dissent amid static prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S Northam platinum mine opens today against the background of a
static platinum price and considerable dissension among local analysts as to
the merits of the project.
Disagreement centres around what sort of grades the mine will produce,
whether or not it is a high cost producer and the timing of the opening.
Although the mine will not be a particularly large producer - between
230,000 and 250,000 troy ounces a year at full production, about 6 per cent
of world supply - its progress is being keenly watched. Not only does it
represent the first venture into platinum for Gold Fields of South Africa,
but recent attempts to expand platinum capacity in South Africa have met
with mixed fortunes.
Although Rustenburg, Impala and Lonhro, the three main producers, have all
increased capacity in recent years, the weak state of the market has caused
Impala to defer development of the Messina and Barplats projects, and Lebowa
Platinum has also encountered problems with the expansion of its Atok mine.
Critics of Northam, like Mr Kevin Kartun of stockbrokers Frankel Pollak
Vinderine, cite four main concerns: that the mine is unequivocally a high
cost producer and therefore vulnerable in any price squeeze; that ore
reserves below 2,000 metres may not be accessible because of heat problems,
shortening the mine's life; that considerable gambles are being taken with
various new technologies; and that the grades claimed by the company are
excessively optimistic.
Mr Dave Russell of brokers Irish &amp; Menell Rosenberg takes a more optimistic
view. He argues that the planning and design of the mine has been methodical
and well proven, and that the predicted grades make the mine a medium-cost
rather than high-cost producer. He is also confident the company has the
requisite technical expertise to deal with any mining problems that might
arise.
Although a platinum price of Dollars 360 an ounce is probably considerably
lower than that envisaged when the mine was conceived in the mid-1980s, Mr
Jeremy Coombes of Johnson Matthey says the rationale behind its development
is still valid. Although much of the increased autocatalyst demand the mine
sought to cash in on has already taken place, widespread and stringent
emissions legislation should ensure this market continues to grow.
Mr Coombes says the supply/demand situation for platinum in 1993 looks
balanced. He predicts more metal from South Africa - Rustenburg has
completed the Amandebult expansion, Impala is recovering from a severely
disrupted year and Lonhro's expansion continues - but believes this will be
absorbed by increased demand for exhaust catalysts from the motor industries
in Europe and the America. He predicts jewellery and industrial off-take at
similar levels to 1992.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Former eastern bloc zinc
exports more than double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZINC EXPORTS from former eastern bloc countries more than doubled last year
from the 1991 level, pushing the western market into a substantial supply
surplus.
Preliminary estimates by the International Lead and Zinc Study Group suggest
eastern bloc net exports rose from 104,000 tonnes in 1991 to 250,000 tonnes.
There was a steep increase from Kazakhstan where western producers,
attracted by low costs, sent zinc concentrate (an intermediate product) for
refining. There was also a sharp rise in Polish exports.
Zinc mine output in the west hardly changed from the 1991 level at 5.58m
tonnes last year. Refined metal production was 0.7 per cent down at 5.35m
tonnes while zinc consumption slipped 0.8 per cent to 5.36m tonnes.
Increased imports took the supply surplus up from 86,000 to 238,000 tonnes.
The surplus is highly visible because much of the metal is in London Metal
Exchange stocks, which reached 500,000 tonnes for the first time.

FT  21 JAN 93 / Government Bonds: Weaker-than-expected retail sales spur UK
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds firmed in fairly active trading yesterday as
weaker-than-expected retail sales in December revived hopes of a further cut
in base rate. Retail sales fell 0.7 per cent last month, compared with
market expectations of a rise of between 0.3 to 0.4 per cent.
The interest rate speculation prompted a steepening of the yield curve, and
at the short end, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 rose  3/32 to 104 3/4 to
yield 6.35 per cent. However, longer-dated issues were held back by the
forthcoming auction, due on January 27, and the 9 per cent 2008 gilt closed
at 101 13/32 down  1/16 on the day, to yield 8.82 per cent.
GERMAN government bond prices fell in late trading ahead of the Bundesbank's
regular fortnightly council meeting today as hopes of a cut in headline
interest rates waned.
The Bundesbank yesterday accepted bids for DM60bn in a tender for 14-day
securities repurchase funds, allocating funds mostly at 8.60 per cent.
The March bund contract traded on Liffe closed a  1/4 point lower at 92.95
in modest volume of little over 35,000 contracts, after an early high of
93.14 and a low of 92.92 in the afternoon.
Caution ahead of the Bundesbank's meeting spread to other European
government bond markets. Dutch bonds tracked their German counterparts,
falling in the late afternoon. However, dealers said that a correction had
been expected after the sharp gains in the Dutch market recently. The new
10-year bond slipped 35 basis points to 99.35, to yield 7.09 per cent.
Elsewhere in Europe, Italian government bonds also ran into profit taking,
and the Liffe March futures contract eased 9 basis points to 94.77.
JAPANESE government bonds closed slightly lower, weighed down by talk that
the government might be forced to issue Y5,000bn-worth of deficit-financing
bonds in the next fiscal year.
Earlier in the day, cash bonds and futures had risen to their highest levels
in nearly five years on growing expectations of a rate cut in Japan. Mr
Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's policy affairs
research council, reportedly called for a decisive cut in the official
discount rate.
The March futures contract rose to 109.63, its highest level since February
5, 1988, but it fell sharply to end at 109.21 in Tokyo after 109.37 on
Tuesday. In London, the contract recovered to 109.29/30.
Some dealers said they expected some short-term weakness in the March
contract but that a target of 110.95 was still possible.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 10-year bond ended at 4.365 per cent in
Tokyo, two basis points higher on the day, and was broadly unchanged in
London trading.
US TREASURY prices posted early gains on speculative buying, lower oil
prices and a reaction to conciliatory noises from the Iraqi government.
However, the early momentum was not sustained and prices eased at the long
end of the yield curve although shorter-dated maturities held their ground.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/32 at 103
21/32 , yielding 7.315 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  1/16 at 100 15/32 , to yield 4.352 per cent.
There was no fresh economic news released yesterday, so trading was
relatively subdued, and attention was fixed on the presidential inauguration
ceremony in Washington.
Prices came off their highs following the president's inaugural address,
which contained nothing specific on fiscal policy, and disappointed
investors who had been looking to Mr Clinton to give more details of his
plans for the economy.
THE London Clearing House said yesterday that it was extending the range of
German securities which can be used as collateral by its clearing members to
cover margin liabilities.
From today, the London Clearing House said it would accept
Bundesschatzanweisungen-Obligationen der Deutschen Bundespost and
Obligationen der Deutschen Bundesbahn.

THE international tranche of the French government's sale of 6m shares in
Rhone-Poulenc, at FFr500 each is oversubscribed, lead-manager, Banque
Indosuez, said yesterday.
The offer period for the 1.7m shares in the chemicals company on sale
outside France and the US will remain open until Monday. The offer period
for the domestic tranche, of 2.7m shares, closes today, while US investors
have until Monday to subscribe to their allocation of 1m shares.
On Monday, the French Finance Ministry decided to go ahead with the sale,
which had been delayed since last year.
Rhone-Poulenc CIs traded above the offer price of the new shares, closing
FFr3 higher at FFr510.

FT  21 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Liffe launches medium-term
German contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE launch of Liffe's medium-term German government bond (Bobl) future today
represents the latest round in a fight with Germany's Deutsche Terminborse
for dominance of German interest-rate products.
Last week, the DTB announced plans to link with France's Matif, increasing
the penetration of its D-Mark products.
This is the first time Liffe has launched a new product in direct
competition with a well-established contract on another exchange.
Liffe's Bobl contract will compete with a similar contract on the DTB,
launched in October 1991, which is currently trading an average daily volume
of 13,000 contracts. Last week, the DTB introduced options on the Bobl
future.
The two exchanges already compete head-to-head over bund futures. So far,
Liffe has managed to hold on to its lead with about 70 per cent of the
market.
Liffe also offers a short-term interest rate contract, known as the Euromark
future, which is now almost as actively traded as the bund future, with
volume of over 50,000 contracts a day.
The introduction of a medium-term bond future will encourage spread-trading.
'The German bond yield curve is expected to steepen, so there is a likely to
be a lot of spread-trading between five and 10 years,' said Mr Steve Ballard
of BZW Futures, one of the designated brokers for the new contract.
By taking a long position in the five-year contract and a short position in
the 10-year contract, investors can express the view that the yield spread
between five and 10-year bonds is set to widen.
Some dealers said the availability of short, medium and long-term
instruments, allowing trading across the yield curve, would help win
business back to Liffe.
The DTB does not yet have a short-term contract although it is currently
considering introducing a D-Mark interest rate future.
According to dealers, international business routed through the DTB in order
to trade the Bobl future could return to Liffe.
'A lot of business has been done through brokers by firms which could deal
directly on Liffe,' one trader claimed.
However, while Liffe dominates bund future trading, cash market trading in
shorter-term German debt is more concentrated in the domestic market, which
could give the DTB a natural advantage, in addition to its head start in the
contract.

FT  21 JAN 93 / International Bonds: French paper under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market yesterday was spread across a variety of
currencies, but investors focused on the French franc market, where two new
issues for French financial institutions, totalling FFr2bn, met strong
demand.
The French bond market was widely tipped to outperform other markets at the
start of the year, but initially failed to live up to expectations due to
concern about currency weakness. Having put the fear of a devaluation behind
them, investors have returned to the French market, which boasts strong
economic fundamentals, prompting a strong rally in the last 10 days.
On the back of the rally, yesterday's FFr1bn issue of 8 1/4 per cent bonds
due 2000 for Banque Nationale de Paris sold out swiftly. Dealers said the
issue, arranged by BNP, was considered very reasonably priced to yield 55
basis points above the comparable French government bond yield, and added
that BNP, which is rated AA1 by Moody's and AA by Standard Poor's, remains a
prime French bank name.
A FFr1bn 10-year issue for Credit Foncier de France, with a partly-paid
structure (40 per cent up front and the balance in a year) met reasonable,
though less enthusiastic, demand. The structure was used by Credit Local for
a FFr2bn five-year deal earlier this year. According to BNP, the structure
allows investors to take a view on French interest rates. However, some
dealers said the structure was of more interest when investors are concerned
about currency risk. The deal was expected to appeal to retail investors.
Elsewhere, Osprey Mortgage Securities launched its fourth issue of
mortgage-backed securities, arranged by Goldman Sachs. The underlying pool
of mortgages is originated by SFK, a subsidiary of Sweden's SE Banken.
Goldman said that Moody's downgrading of SE Banken's debt last week to A2
did not affect the triple-A rating of the mortgage-backed securities.
The Dollars 280m issue brings the amount of mortgages securitised by SE
Banken under the Osprey programme to more than Dollars 1bn. So far, SE
Banken has been the only Swedish bank to securitise mortgages, but the
crisis in the Swedish banking industry is expected to encourage other banks
to securitise mortgages in order to remove assets from their balance sheets.
In the Eurosterling market, Confederation Life, the Canadian insurance
company, launched a Pounds 100m issue of 10-year subordinated bonds which
will count as lower tier 2 capital under Basle capital guidelines, which
came into force at the start of the year.
The 10-year bonds were priced to yield 160 basis points over the comparable
gilt. The lead manager reported strong demand but some dealers said
investors were concerned about the credit.

MIM Holdings, the Australian resources group, yesterday announced a 45 per
cent increase in net profit to ADollars 51.1m (USDollars 36.5m) for the six
months to December 13, in spite of a weak second quarter.
Net profit rose to ADollars 76.8m including an abnormal profit of ADollars
25.7m from the sale of a 28 per cent interest in the McArthur River zinc
mining project. Sales rose 3.6 per cent to ADollars 871m. MIM said the
improved result was caused by a fall in the value of the Australian dollar,
higher domestic gold sales, higher coal sales from the Oakey Creek mines,
and a higher zinc price.
Gold operations at Porgera, the Papua New Guinea mining operation which is
30 per cent owned by Highlands Gold, a 65 per cent subsidiary of MIM,
produced 'good' results.
Second-quarter net profit before abnormals was ADollars 16.6m, an increase
on the ADollars 12.5m profit in the comparable period of the previous year,
but lower than the ADollars 34.5m profit achieved in the first quarter of
the current year.
MIM said the subdued second-quarter result was influenced by a downturn in
prices for copper, lead, silver and zinc. Sales volumes were lower.

NET profits at Republic New York Corporation, the holding company of
Republic National Bank and The Manhattan Savings Bank, rose by 13.9 per cent
last year to Dollars 258.9m.
That translates into Dollars 4.42 per common share, against Dollars 3.95 per
share in 1991.
Republic, controlled by Mr Edmond Safra, achieved these results in spite of
nearly-doubled bad debt provision of Dollars 120m for 1992.
Net income in the fourth quarter of last year was 14.8 per cent higher at
Dollars 66.8m (Dollars 1.14 per share).
Bad-debt provision was Dollars 35m, against Dollars 14m in the last quarter
of 1991.

CHAMPION Technology, the recently-listed telepaging group, has formed a
joint venture with the privately-owned Harilela group which will be aimed at
the Indian telecommunications market, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
The joint venture has a 47 per cent stake in New Delhi-based Weston Pagers.
Weston is in the running for a national paging services licence from the
Indian government, which has recently deregulated the telecommunications
industry.
Champion will supply equipment and technical and operational services to
Weston. It will also make pagers in India.
No details on shareholdings in the joint venture were provided.
The group also said that it had signed agreements with Orbital Sciences of
the US to provide low orbit satellite two-way communication services in
China.
It said that the system was low cost compared with high-orbit satellite
systems.
The group will be responsible for modifying the system to suit China's
market demands, such as developing Chinese language communication services.

MIM Holdings, the Australian resources group, yesterday announced a 45 per
cent increase in net profit to ADollars 51.1m (USDollars 36.5m) for the six
months to December 13, in spite of a weak second quarter.
Net profit rose to ADollars 76.8m including an abnormal profit of ADollars
25.7m from the sale of a 28 per cent interest in the McArthur River zinc

Sales increased by 3.6 per cent to ADollars 871m.
MIM said the improved result was caused by a fall in the value of the

Oakey Creek mines, and a higher zinc price.
Gold operations at Porgera, the Papua New Guinea mining operation which is
30 per cent owned by Highlands Gold, a 65 per cent subsidiary of MIM,
produced 'good' results, the group said.
Second-quarter net profit before abnormals was ADollars 16.6m, a significant
increase on the ADollars 12.5m profit in the comparable period of the
previous year, but substantially lower than the ADollars 34.5m profit
achieved in the first quarter of the current year.
MIM said the subdued second-quarter result was influenced by a significant
downturn in prices for copper, lead, silver and zinc. Sales volumes were
also lower, particularly for zinc.
Mr Norm Fussell, chief executive, said the group had achieved its target of
cutting costs at the Mount Isa mine in Queensland by ADollars 100m a year.
MIM said last month that output of zinc/lead ore at Mount Isa would be cut
by 15 per cent in response to low prices.
The directors declared an unfranked interim dividend of 2.5 cents, compared
with 2 cents in the first half of the previous year.
MIM shares closed 3cents higher at ADollars 2.32 on the Australian Stock
Exchange.

FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Arnotts advances 33% at half way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit-maker, yesterday said a 33 per cent increase
in six-month net profits to ADollars 37.4m (USDollars 26.7m) before abnormal
items justified its rejection of a hostile takeover offer by Campbell Soup,
the US food group.
The company is increasing its interim dividend to 15 cents a share from the
10.5 cents paid a year ago.
Mr Bill Purdy, chairman, said the result underlined the inadequacy of
Campbell's 'final' offer of ADollars 9.50 a share, which values Arnotts at
ADollars 1.3bn. 'Do not sell; the company is too valuable,' he told
shareholders.
Mr Purdy said Arnotts was on course to achieve its forecast net profit of
ADollars 67.7m before abnormal items for the year ending June 1993. The
board has also forecast a net profit of ADollars 80.9m for 1993-94.
Arnotts said it would continue to urge Campbell to increase its offer to
about ADollars 11, the mid-point of a range of valuations for the company's
shares produced in an independent report by Grant Samuel, the merchant bank.
A number of financial institutions are believed to be considering accepting
the offer for part of their holdings, which would give Campbell more than 50
per cent ownership of Arnotts.
However, the New South Wales supreme court has ruled that a 1985 agreement
between the companies means that Campbell must acquire 85.1 per cent of the
shares before it can take control of Arnotts' board.
Analysts say Campbell would need to improve its offer or launch a new offer
later in the year to achieve board control. Campbell has said it would not
improve the offer in any circumstances.
Arnotts said its improved result reflected improved productivity in its
biscuit division following substantial restructuring, the disposal of
non-core activities and the successful launch of several new products.
The group said biscuit margins had improved 'significantly,' and forecast
further benefits from the restructuring would flow through into profits in
the second half.
The improved profit was achieved on turnover up 6.7 per cent to ADollars
363.6m after adjusting for the sale of non-core businesses.
The group said that biscuit sales volume was 'steady, in spite of the poor
state of the economy.'
Net profit increased to ADollars 53.3m after including an abnormal profit of
ADollars 15.8m resulting from the sale of the group's White Rose flour mill
operations and a packaging company, offset by restructuring costs and
additional taxation.

NESTLE Hungaria, part of the Swiss foods group, yesterday kick-started
Budapest's commercial paper market with an issue of short-term notes.
Nestle Hungaria is to issue up to Ft2bn (Dollars 24m) in notes with
principal guaranteed by Nestle. Nestle Hungaria said it would use the
proceeds to satisfy its regular working capital needs. The notes are not
expected to a premium above Hungarian Treasury bills, which have an average
yield of 16.2 per cent, according to the DWIX index.
Nestle Hungaria will make considerable savings by borrowing through a CP
issue rather than through banks. The most competitive prime rates are about
5 per cent higher than Treasury yields, largely because of banks'
requirements to hold reserves.
Credit Suisse First Boston, which is acting as dealer and arranger, said it
was in talks with other companies on CP issues.
CSFB expects joint ventures, units of multinationals and domestic companies
to make CP issues this year. CSFB Budapest has already arranged Forint bond
issues for itself and the Hungarian units of McDonald's and Levi Strauss.

FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Tenneco chief reveals illness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Walsh, chief executive of Tenneco for just over a year and the
architect of a rapid turnround in the company's fortunes, revealed yesterday
he was suffering from a brain tumour, but said this would not affect his
ability to carry out his work.
He said he had been advised that the median survival rate for patients with
this condition, detected this early, and undergoing the kind of radiation
and chemotherapy treatment he intended, was approximately five to six years,
with half doing better than that, and some much better.
Tenneco's shares dropped Dollars 1 3/8 in morning trading and finally closed
Dollars 2 down on the day at Dollars 42.
Mr Walsh, 50, is a tough manager who revitalised the Union Pacific railroad
before joining Tenneco in late 1991, with a mandate to shake up the ailing
conglomerate.
He quickly turned around its earnings and cut its burdensome debt to capital
ratio but Wall Street analysts are still waiting for proof of a sustained
recovery at its most troubled subsidiary, agricultural equipment
manufacturer JI Case.
Mr Walsh said the 'mid-grade tumour' had been identified at an early stage
and the only symptom was a slight limp in his left leg. The ailment in no
way affected his commitment to the company.
His doctor declared that he could continue to 'carry out the full range of
his responsibilities at Tenneco now, during treatment, and for the
foreseeable future'.
He only discovered he had a tumour on Tuesday. His remarkably rapid and full
disclosure of the problem is in line with his face-the-facts style of
management and contrasts with much greater privacy over medical matters at
most US companies.
TLC Beatrice, a large, privately-owned food company, disclosed that its
chairman, Mr Reginald Lewis, had brain cancer on Monday, by which time he
was in a coma in hospital. He died on Tuesday.
Mr Walsh said he had decided to announce his condition because not to have
done so would have led to rumours and speculation which could have put
investors at risk.

FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Royal Trustco negotiating
alliance following review
</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL TRUSTCO, Canada's second-biggest trust company, is negotiating an
alliance with another institution, and the Toronto Bronfman family may cede
its 48 per cent indirect control.
The Edper Bronfmans, related to the Montreal Bronfmans who control Seagram,
won control of Royal Trustco in a spectacular takeover battle with property
developer Mr Robert Campeau in 1979.
Royal Bank of Canada, the country's largest bank, later confirmed it was
among the institutions holding talks with Royal Trustco. RBC also said it
was rethinking its credit policy after suffering from CDollars 2.05bn
(USDollars 1.6bn) in loan losses for fiscal 1992.
In the past two years, RT has been hit by the property collapse in Britain
and the US as well as the recession in Canada. While it has insisted its
core fiduciary and banking business in Canada remained sound, RT has sold
major assets and has written down loan losses heavily.
Mr James Miller, 61, the chartered accountant who took over as chief
executive on December 1, said: 'RT prefers to seek an alliance with another
large financial institution that would make a major equity investment.
'Talks are under way with a number of institutions which could result in the
new investor ultimately becoming the largest shareholder of RT.'
Mr Miller said the talks resulted from a complete strategic review of RT
undertaken with London investment bankers, SG Warburg, and due for
completion on January 31.
Trilon, a holding company through which the Bronfmans control RT, last month
bought in CDollars 100m of publicly-held RT preferred shares and is ready to
put in CDollars 100m of new equity to demonstrate its continuing support, Mr
Miller said.
Mr Miller warned that more write-downs would come in the year-end results.
'A loss is projected in the final quarter, which will also include
restructuring charges.'

growth

UNISYS, the US computer and defence manufacturer, reported strong earnings
gains for the fourth quarter and year. It added that it expected significant
earnings growth in 1993, setting the company on the path to recovery after
three years of heavy losses.
Unisys's strong results contrast sharply with the heavy losses reported by
IBM a day earlier.
Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive, said: 'In a very difficult
year for our industry, we successfully turned the company round and exceeded
all our financial and operational goals.'
For 1992, Unisys reported net income of Dollars 361.2m, or Dollars 1.40 per
share, including 36 cents per share tax gain from loss carry-forwards.
In the previous year, it reported a net loss of Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars
9.37, which included a special charge of Dollars 1.2bn. The net income data
exclude preferred stock dividends of Dollars 122m per year.
Revenue declined in 1992 to Dollars 8.42bn from Dollars 8.7bn in 1991, or
Dollars 8.57bn adjusted for the sale of the Timeplex subsidiary in June
1991.
While IBM's sales of mainframe computers declined by a double-digit
percentage in 1992, Unisys said sales of its mainframe computer showed
double-digit gains over 1991.
For the fourth quarter, Unisys made net income of Dollars 139.2m, or 58
cents a share, including 15 cents per share from the tax benefits of
operating loss carry-forwards. Last time, it recorded net income of Dollars
80.5m, or 31 cents. Revenue of Dollars 2.26bn was higher than expected, the
company said, but below the Dollars 2.46bn in the fourth quarter of 1991.
Mr Unruh said that '1992 was an outstanding turnround year. Revenue
stabilised, profitability improved, and cash flow from operations exceeded
Dollars 1.1bn - well over our goal of Dollars 700m'. Debt was reduced nearly
Dollars 800m to about Dollars 2.5bn.
Debt net of cash is now less than Dollars 1.7bn, the lowest level since the
formation of the company in 1986 from the merger of Burroughs and Sperry.
Mr Unruh also announced a 'major initiative' to build information services
capabilities.
'For 1993, we expect to show further significant progress in profitability
and to further strengthen our balance sheet in spite of global economic
weakness, particularly in Europe and Japan. We have based our business plans
on flat revenues.'
The Unisys share price gained Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 12 5/8 on news of the
fourth-quarter performance, but closed at Dollars 12 1/2 for a net gain of
Dollars  5/8 on the day.

TAXED income from the gold mines in the Gengold group fell by 11 per cent to
R65.1m (Dollars 21.2m) in the December quarter, compared with the previous
three months.
But Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said the mines were in stronger shape
than a year ago following a campaign to mine more efficiently.
The improvement is reflected by income after tax and capital expenditure
rising to R48.3m compared with R22.4m in the December 1991 quarter.
Total tonnes milled in the group dropped by 18 per cent to 2.92m in the
December quarter from 3.56m a year previously. The average yield, however,
rose by 18 per cent to 6 grammes per tonne from 5.1.
While gold production over the same period fell by 4 per cent to 17,459kg,
working costs per kg of gold produced fell by 3 per cent to R26,812 per kg,
despite inflation averaging about 14 per cent during 1992.
The best performances during the quarter came from Beatrix and Unisel which
respectively increased taxed income to R12.7m from R7.9m and to R5.8m from
R3.3m from the September quarter.
St Helena made a R3.4m loss compared with R4.1m profit the previous quarter.
The figures, however, include a R8.6m one-off retrenchment cost following an
effective halving of the mine's operations.
Mr Maude said the St Helena mine was set to make a solid return to profit.
At the Anglovaal and Johannesburg Consolidated Investment groups, profits
from gold mines increased during the December quarter.
Helped by an impressive performance from flagship Hartebeestfontein,
Anglovaal lifted taxed profits by 57 per cent to R35.3m from R22.5m during
the quarter.
Taxed profit at Hartebeestfontein rose to R32m from R20.7m. Elsewhere in the
group profits at ETC rose to R5.8m from R5m while losses at Loraine fell to
R2.9m from R3.4m.
Taxed profits in the JCI group rose by 11.3 per cent to R62.6m from R56.2m
on the back of a 3 per cent increase in production to 12,714kg from
12,338kg. Randfontein and Western Areas jointly broadly maintained taxed
profits at R48.4m and R8.9m respectively.
While Joel improved its financial performance considerably in the last
quarter - taxed profits rose to R5.2m from R775,000 - poor development
results caused tons milled to fall by 14.4 per cent.
The lower levels of production have forced the mine to take steps to restore
profitability.

DATA GENERAL, the US minicomputer manufacturer, had a better-than-expected
first quarter, achieving a small profit despite weak market conditions. Net

cents last year. Operating income was Dollars 4.2m, against Dollars 4.9m.
First-quarter revenues fell to Dollars 279.6m, from Dollars 294.8m as sales
of traditional proprietary products declined.
Data General said, however, sales of its 'open systems' computers continued
to grow during the quarter, and became the company's top selling product
line.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric of the US yesterday reported a 6 per cent increase in
fourth-quarter earnings, helped by an improving domestic economy and strong
shipments from its power systems business.
The company made Dollars 1.34bn, compared with Dollars 1.26bn in the same
period of 1991. Earnings per share rose 8 per cent from Dollars 1.46 to
Dollars 1.57, and revenues rose from Dollars 17.6bn to Dollars 17.8bn.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said GE was 'better positioned than ever before,
with a strong balance sheet, very strong cash-flows and excellent prospects
for earnings growth.'
In 1992 overall, GE's earnings rose 7 per cent to Dollars 4.72bn, while its
share repurchase programme helped lift earnings per share 8 per cent to
Dollars 5.51. Revenues rose 3 per cent to Dollars 62.2bn.
GE estimated that earnings from continuing operations - excluding its
aerospace division, being sold to Martin Marietta - would show a rise of
around 10 per cent.
Mr Welch said the company's performance in 1992 had been lead by
double-digit earnings increases at GE Financial Services, Power Systems and
Medical Services.
He added that the year's operating highlight was 'the increasing ability of
the businesses to turn the rhetoric of 'speed' into reality . . . as
demonstrated by record inventory turnover and productivity of nearly 5 per
cent during a period of slow global growth.
'This not only increased earnings but also translated into a record Dollars
5.3bn in operating cash-flow, some Dollars 1.3bn over 1991 results.'
Earnings at GE Financial Services totalled Dollars 1.499bn for the year, 18
per cent up on 1991's Dollars 1.275bn. GE Capital, the main financial
services arm, saw double-digit earnings growth, and Kidder, Peabody, the
securities house, achieved 'sharply improved' results.

FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse loss hits Dollars
1.29bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate, yesterday reported a
fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 1.18bn and full-year loss of Dollars
1.29bn as it took a large and previously-announced charge to cover the
disposal of its troubled financial services business.
However, its fourth-quarter net income from continuing operations was also
down, due primarily to a decline in earnings at its electronic systems
operations and the dilution of earnings per share through a preferred stock
issue.
Mr Paul Lego, the chairman, warned that the group's first quarter results
might be below those for the same period of 1992, due to lower-than-expected
order rates.
He said the aim was to have better results than in 1992 for the full 1993
year, with improvement coming in the second half of the year.
The fourth-quarter net loss worked through at Dollars 3.44 a share and
compared with profits of Dollars 171m, or 51 cents a share, in the same
period of last year.
Sales and revenues were little changed at Dollars 2.35bn, compared with
Dollars 2.36bn.
The company took a special charge of Dollars 1.28bn for the disposal of its
financial services business, which has been a financial mill-stone for the
past two years. It announced plans to shed the business last November.
Net income from continuing operations in the quarter totalled Dollars 91m,
or 22 cents a share, compared with Dollars 137m, or 41 cents a year ago.
For the full year, Westinghouse reported net income from continuing
operations of Dollars 348m, or 93 cents, compared with Dollars 265m, or 84
cents, in 1991. Its net loss was Dollars 1.29bn, or Dollars 3.81 a share,
compared with a net loss of Dollars 1.09bn, or Dollars 3.46 a share in 1991.
The company said operating profits for electronic systems were down
substantially in the fourth quarter because of reduced sales to the US
military and a previously reported charge for job cuts.

<TEXT>
LTV, the steel company at the centre of one of the longest-running and most
contentious bankruptcy cases in the US, yesterday filed its second modified
plan of reorganisation.
With most parties agreed on the shape of LTV's restructuring, the plan is
likely to be put to creditors and shareholders in March. If approved, LTV
could emerge from Chapter 11 protection within months - thus ending a
bankruptcy which began in 1986.
The company said yesterday if the plan was approved as submitted, it would
emerge as the third-largest US steel company. It would also own a large
energy unit, supplying products and equipment to the oil and natural gas
industries.
The new reorganisation plan is complicated. Essentially, it aims to resolve
almost Dollars 6bn-worth of claims and a further Dollars 3bn of
pension-related claims.
Creditors' claims are levied against five different entities - the parent
company and four operating divisions comprising the steel, aerospace, AM
General and energy businesses.
As far as LTV's under-funded pension plans are concerned. the company will
make an initial cash contribution to the three steel plans of Dollars 850m
(adjusted for interim funding provided while the company remains in Chapter
11), and the remaining unfunded liability will be amortised over 28 years.
Annual payments will comprise a fixed element ranging between Dollars 30m
and Dollars 50m a year, plus a variable element of at least 50 per cent of
available cashflow after allowance for capital expenditures.
Under the new plan, general unsecured creditors' recoveries should range
from 16 cents on the dollar if claims are against the parent company, to
almost 56 cents against the aerospace business.

MR BARRY DILLER, who resigned last February as chairman of Mr Rupert
Murdoch's Fox film and television studio, has been named chairman and chief
executive of QVC Network, a leading US cable television home shopping
network.
The move follows Mr Diller's recent agreement to purchase Dollars 25m of
QVC's equity in a privately-negotiated transaction.
The negotiations that led to Mr Diller's appointment are believed to be
aimed at achieving joint control of QVC's board by Mr Diller and two
corporate partners which are also substantial QVC shareholders - Liberty
Media, a Wyoming-based company that has also agreed to buy voting control of
QVC's main rival, and Comcast, a cable operator.
QVC recorded Dollars 36.2m net profits on Dollars 729m of revenues in the
first nine months of its 1992-93 fiscal year.

<TEXT>
BOISE Cascade, the US paper and forest products company, yesterday unveiled
a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 29.6m, or 97 cents a share, compared with a
deficit of Dollars 15.8m, or 51 cents, last year.
For the year, it incurred a loss of Dollars 227.5m, or Dollars 6.73, which
included a Dollars 73m, or Dollars 1.94-a-share, after-tax charge for
required accounting changes. In 1991, Boise Cascade recorded a deficit of
Dollars 79.5m, or Dollars 2.46.
The result had been widely expected on Wall Street, where the stock traded
up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 21 before the close.
Weak prices for the company's key paper grades offset the positive impact of
cost-cutting and strengthening timber prices on the annual results, the
company said.
Sales for the fourth quarter fell to Dollars 905m, from Dollars 963m a year
ago, while for the year sales were Dollars 3.7bn, down from Dollars 4bn in
1991.
The company attributed the sales declines to falling paper prices and the
January 1992 divestiture of the company's wholesale office products
distribution operations.
Mr John Fery, chairman, said he expected Boise's building products
operations to benefit in 1993 from strengthening demand, and office products
sectors to improve as a result of cost-cutting and recovering markets. He
added that market conditions for the company's paper products were
improving, but 'very difficult'.

THE St PAUL Companies, the Minnesota-based property-casualty insurer, has
written off Dollars 365m of goodwill attaching to the Minet group, the
troubled London-based insurance brokerage business which the US insurer
acquired in 1988.
St Paul announced it planned a non-cash charge, covering a write-off of
goodwill for Minet, in November, although it did not specify the amount.
The US company said that the write-off represented about 75 per cent of the
goodwill attaching to Minet.
It also warned that catastrophe losses - in a dreadful year for the US
property-casualty sector generally - totalled Dollars 305m before tax in
1992. This is more than quadruple the losses seen by St Paul in 1990 and
1991. Hurricane Andrew, the devastating storm system which struck Florida in
late-August, accounted for about Dollars 200m.
As a result of goodwill write-off, the catastrophe losses, a much-smaller
charge related to an early retirement programme, and 'disappointing'
fourth-quarter results from its reinsurance and international underwriting
operations, Minet expects an after-tax operating loss of about Dollars 335m
for 1992.

MAZDA, the Japanese carmaker, is still pursuing a possible joint project in
Europe with Ford, Mr Yoshihiro Wada, Mazda president, said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
A joint venture with Ford of Europe remained a top priority, he said.
Mazda is the only leading Japanese carmaker that has not yet announced plans
for production in Europe, despite negotiations with Ford of Europe that have
lasted for nearly four years.
Mr Wada said Mazda was also 'studying alternative projects in Europe with
other European makers but it is not the time to disclose their names as we
first have to make a decision on a possible joint project with Ford'.
Mazda is owned 24.5 per cent by Ford.
The Japanese carmaker said it was also studying the feasibility of exporting
cars from its US plant to Europe, following in the wake of Toyota, Honda and
Mitsubishi Motors. No decision had yet been made on volumes or timing.
Mazda again reduced its parent company pre-tax profit forecast yesterday to
Y6bn from the earlier forecast of Y7bn for the year to the end of March.
Pre-tax profits totalled Y19.7bn a year ago.

between the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a federal agency which
underpins basic pension payments, and other creditors - one of the main
reasons why the bankruptcy has been so lengthy.
Under the new reorganisation plan, general unsecured creditors' recoveries
are estimated to range from 16 cents on the dollar if their claims are
against the parent company, to almost 56 cents against the aerospace
business.
Since general unsecured claims are being paid either in new common stock, or
a combination of stock, cash and other considerations, these estimates will
ultimately depend on the value at which the new shares trade,

GENENTECH, the California-based biotechnology company that was taken over in
1990 by Roche Holdings of Switzerland, yesterday reported net profits of
Dollars 20.8m, or 18 cents a share, for 1992.
Earnings were less than half the Dollars 44.3m, or 39 cents, achieved in
1991, but in line with market expectations.
Genentech had previously forecast profits of more than Dollars 18m for 1992,
saying the year-on-year decline was due to an anticipated increase in
research and development expenses.
Net profits for the fourth quarter of 1992 were Dollars 6.2m, compared with
a break-even result in the same period of 1991.
The decline in full-year earnings occurred despite a 6 per cent rise in
total revenues, to Dollars 544.3m. Fourth-quarter revenues were up 19 per
cent at Dollars 142m.
Research and development spending in 1992 was 26 per cent higher at Dollars
278.6m.

FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Rivalries seen as bar to
foreigners on Borse board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROVINCIALISM and regional rivalries are to blame for the exclusion of
foreign banks from the supervisory board of the Deutsche Borse - the new
centralised stock exchange for Germany - the head of the organisation
representing foreign banks in Germany complained yesterday.
The Deutsche Borse came into being at the beginning of the year as a holding
structure uniting Germany's eight stock-exchanges - together with the
Deutsche Termin Borse (DTB) derivatives market and the Kassenverein
settlement agency - for the first time.
The move represented a compromise between Frankfurt - overwhelmingly the
largest stock exchange in Germany - and the smaller markets which had
traditionally resisted centralisation out of fear of Frankfurt's dominance.
The creation of the Deutsche Borse suggested that traditional rivalries had
been buried.
However, Mr Hans-Georg Engel, vice-president of J. P. Morgan in Germany and
head of the Verband der Auslandsbanken in Deutschland, said yesterday that
provincial rivalries had seen to it that no foreign bank had been
represented on the new organisation's board, contrary to commitments when
the plans for a centralised exchange were being drawn up.
He argued that foreign banks deserved to be represented on three grounds:
because they own 10 per cent of the Deutsch Borse holding company; because
they conduct about 10 per cent of the business on German stock exchanges,
and because in terms of member-firms they represent over half the
institutions trading on the German securities markets,
'Pure political factors' had determined that regional banks had got four
seats on the supervisory board, despite the fact that the regional stock
exchanges own only 10 per cent of the Deutsche Borse holding company - the
same as the foreign institutions.
He said he hoped that foreign banks would gain representation later this
year; the Deutsche Borse said that it also wanted foreign banks to be
represented.

FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: AMR to cut spending as shortfall
reaches Dollars 935m

AMR, parent company of American Airlines, yesterday opened the US airlines'
reporting season with news of a Dollars 145m operating loss in the final
quarter of 1992, and an after-tax deficit of Dollars 200m for the
three-month period. Revenues rose by 5.1 per cent, to Dollars 3.58bn.
The fourth-quarter results bring AMR's net loss for the year to Dollars
935m. However, this partially reflects non-cash charges related to a change
in US accounting methods for post-retirement health benefits. The net loss
in 1992 before the accounting-related charges stood at Dollars 475m.
Revenues were Dollars 14.4bn, up from Dollars 12.9bn in the previous year.
Mr Bob Crandall, American's chairman, said the figures reflected 'one of the
most difficult and challenging years in the history of commercial aviation'.
He also cautioned against expecting a rapid turnround: 'Although the economy
has recently shown some signs of strength, we think much of the recent
optimism is unwarranted', he commented.
'As a result of our concern about the outlook for profitability, we have cut
more than Dollars 300m from anticipated 1993 spending and continue to look
for other solutions to our earnings dilemma.'
AMR is generally seen as a bellwether for the US airline sector, and its
large fourth-quarter and 12-month losses are likely to be mirrored at other
carriers.
However, in AMR's case, some one-off charges compounded the difficulties.
The Dollars 145m fourth-quarter operating loss included a Dollars 22m charge
related to severance payments, while the Dollars 200m net deficit included
Dollars 145m-worth of provisions for aircraft lease terminations and losses
on a computer reservation project, partly offset by a Dollars 103m tax
benefit.
These one-off items, plus some special charges earlier in the year, also
impacted the full-year figures.
The airline, one of the 'Big Three' US carriers which opposed British
Airways' planned Dollars 750m investment in USAir, also indicated yesterday
that it would fight any scaled-down investment proposal by the UK carrier.
There has been speculation that BA would announce plans to take a voting
stake of around 20 per cent in USAir, for around Dollars 340m. American
echoed calls made by other opponents of the deal for a review of US policy
towards foreign ownership of US airlines.
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which holds a minority equity interest in and
Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, yesterday released more
details of the proposed integration of the ir two airlines' services - their
454 aircraft and all ticketing and promotional material.

FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Disposals ease burden of
deficits - Spain could raise up to Dollars 2.8bn through share issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish government has long intended to raise cash this year through
disposals in order to lighten its deficit burden. The surprise is the amount
it seems to want and the speed with which it hopes to raise it.
Hot on the heels of the announcement by Repsol, the government-controlled
energy group, that it is seeking to raise more than Dollars 500m in an
international share issue, Argentaria, the wholly state-owned banking
corporation, has said that it wants to put 25 per cent of itself on the
market in order to raise about Dollars 1.3bn.
These disposals are likely to be followed by two further placements.
Analysts expect the government to offer investors around 10 per cent of its
67 per cent stake in Endesa, the large electrical utility, in an issue that
could raise Dollars 860m. They also see a possible placement of as much as
20 per cent of Tabacalera, the tobacco-based group in which the government
has a 54 per cent holding, which would realise a further Dollars 173m.
If all four issues took place, the state would net around Dollars 2.8bn  -
more than double the government's estimates in its 1993 budget.
The most common explanation for this increase is that the government
urgently needs income because it has got its budgetary sums wrong. It is
particularly worried that it will be unable to reduce the budget deficit
this year by a planned two points, to 2.5 per cent of gross domestic
product.
Those fears are well grounded. The budget forecast 1 per cent growth for
1993, an estimate that now appears wildly off-target.
'We believe the economy will grow by 0.3 per cent this year and we may be
optimistic,' says Mr Jaine de Pinies, head of research at Banco Santander de
Negocios.
Just as ominously, there has been no sign so far that government spending
has been contained.
In fact, analysts expect spending to rise, partly because this is an
election year and partly because of the demands on the social security
department by the growing legions of the unemployed.
Barred from any move that might kick-start the economy, such as lowering the
cost of borrowing (because high interest rates are required to refinance
existing government debt) and also blocked - because of the elections - from
raising taxes, the government has few options other than to sell off as much
as it can.
The question is: can it sell so much, so quickly?
'If the disposals are tackled intelligently, spaced out and properly priced,
the market should absorb them without difficulty,' says Mr Juan Bastos,
director-general of the Madrid securities firm Gestemar.
Repsol, Endesa and Tabacalera are all actively-traded blue chips that need
no introduction to investors.
Argentaria, though a newcomer to the trading floor, is a powerful and sound
institution that may offer an opportunity to gain a presence in Spain's
profitable banking sector.
If potential investors have reason to be bullish, the government is equally
justified in being encouraged by the prospective placements.
The disposals should help see it through what looks like being an otherwise
bleak year.

SKANDANAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, is planning
a sweeping reorganisation to help restore profitability.
An announcement is expected within the next month, and could come after
today's group board meeting.
The restructuring could include severe job cuts, branch closures, management
changes and the sale of non-core businesses. The bank said yesterday that a
reorganisation was under way but would not comment on reports that it was to
be split into three parts, covering traditional business, corporate lending
and bad debts.
News of the planned overhaul comes just over a month after the bank
contacted the government about possible state support.
SE Banken has suffered large credit losses, along with other Swedish banks,
and recorded a SKr2.61bn (Dollars 361.5m) operating loss for the first eight
months of last year. Credit losses for the whole of 1992 are expected to
reach SKr10bn. Capital adequacy has also been impaired by the falling value
of the floating Swedish krona.

LYONNAISE des Eaux Dumez, the French water and building group, yesterday
announced that 1992 profits would be between FFr350m (Dollars 64.2m) and
FFr400m, less than one-third of what it had forecast.
Lyonnaise's sudden profit revision, entirely due to large losses and
provisions on property and construction in France and abroad, led to a wave
of selling in its shares which were suspended 5.5 per cent down at FFr435.5
on the Paris bourse yesterday.
By taking large losses and provisions and 'purging our 1992 balance sheet,
we are perhaps being excessively prudent,' a company spokesman said. 'But we
are very pessimistic about real estate prospects.'
By contrast, the water and environmental services of the old Lyonnaise des
Eaux which merged with the Dumez group in 1990 produced a profit, as did the
group's other interests. Lyonnaise said it planned to maintain its
Fr10-a-share dividend because the 'particularly heavy' charges for last year
did not affect the group's fundamental financial soundness.
Lyonnaise said it had had to make extra provisions of FFr1bn for real estate
problems and FFr500m for construction difficulties. In addition to problems
in France leading Dumez to lay off some 500 people at a cost of FFr400m, the
group was experiencing troubles abroad.
One area of difficulty was in Spain, where its Copisa subsidiary had seen
business collapse after completion of the Barcelona Olympic facilities.
Losses and provisions were FFr250m. Another FFr275m in provisions had been
made to cope with the downturn in Saudi Arabia, particularly after the Gulf
war. Lyonnaise had set aside FFr100m because the political and security
situation in Kashmir was delaying completion of a dam there.
Last June, Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, had forecast a 20 per cent rise in
1992 group profits which had fallen to FFr1.17bn from FFr1.4bn the year
before. The company said yesterday it had had to revise its forecast because
the last few weeks of 1992 had proved far worse than expected in property
and it saw no improvement for most of 1993.

THE ALEM Bank-Kazakhstan, from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, has
joined a group of Turkish investors to buy a 75 per cent stake in
Deutsch-Schweizerische Bank (DSB), a small Frankfurt-based bank.
Alem is believed to be the first financial institution from the former
Soviet Union to buy a stake in a German bank.
The Kazakh bank, which specialises in foreign trade finance, has taken a 40
per cent stake in DSB.
A group of Turkish investors have bought the remaining 35 per cent of the
stake owned by Harpener, the German industrial group which is in the throes
of restructuring following a costly entanglement with Mr Werner Rey, the
Swiss financier.
The Turkish buyers are the London-based Plus Communications and Technology
and Mr Ahmet Ozal, a son of Turkey's president.
The remaining 25 per cent of DSB is owned by the Swiss Canto Bank, a Swiss
foreign trade bank.
No financial details were disclosed, but it is understood that the investors
paid more than the DM19m (Dollars 11.9m) book value of the bank's assets.
Mr Manfred Heuser, a director of the DSB, said the buyers intended to
concentrate on financing trade between Kazakhstan, Germany and Turkey and
developing its international banking business.
The Alem Bank was founded two years ago and now finances 75 per cent of
Kazakhstan's foreign trade, he added.

<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE, the French state carrier, yesterday announced a consolidated
loss of FFr3.2bn (Dollars 597m) for last year, but said it expected to halve
this loss in 1993.
Mr Bernard Attali, president, last month warned that his company's 1992 loss
would be around FFr3bn.
In 1991, the airline made a FFr685m loss.
After a board meeting yesterday, Air France said its hope for a reduced 1993
loss was based on the assumption that it would carry 6 per cent more
passengers and 7 per cent more freight than it did in 1992.
Last year, it saw an 8.7 per cent rise in passenger traffic.
Mr Attali has complained to the European Commission that its competition
directorate has favoured his arch-rival, British Airways, to Air France's
detriment.
He has also warned Brussels against rushing deregulation in a way that could
weaken European airlines financially as it has in the US.
To counteract this, Air France will slim its workforce by a further 1,200
this year. But some new jobs related to the servicing of aircraft from
Sabena, the Belgian carrier in which Air France has an important stake, will
be created.
Last year, Air France reduced its payroll by 1,900, including some forced
redundancies for the first time in its history.

PRIME People, the Manchester-based specialist training group which recently
completed a Pounds 2.8m reverse takeover of Bowford Engineering, issued a
profits warning late yesterday and announced that its chairman, Mr Alan
Greenough, had resigned.
Mr Greenough has been replaced by Mr Peter Hearn, a chartered accountant and
existing board member. In addition, Mr Chris Heayberd has joined the board
as finance director and will conduct a cost reduction programme and
introduce tight financial controls.
The board said that as a result of a 'lower than expected level of
activity,' principally in Bowford Engineering, results for the year to
October 31 were expected to be 'significantly below expectations.'
Ahead of the announcement Prime People's stock had closed unchanged at 4 1/2
p. Last November analysts expected the combined group to report a four-fold
increase in annual pre-tax profits to around Pounds 1.1m.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TWO INSURANCE companies, Commercial Union and Legal &amp; General, have
announced falls in new UK annual premium business for 1992.
CU saw a 2 per cent drop in UK regular premium business to Pounds 56.3m,
while L&amp;G suffered a 16 per cent fall from Pounds 170m to Pounds 143m.
On worldwide annual premiums, CU rose 9 per cent to Pounds 180m, thanks to
sharp increases in the US, Canada and continental Europe outside the
Netherlands; L&amp;G fell 12 per cent to Pounds 196m.
In both cases, the lingering UK recession, which deters consumers from
taking out long-term commitments, was held responsible.
Both companies registered a rise in overall new business following increases
in single premiums. CU's new single premiums in the UK more than tripled to
Pounds 426m, helped by Pounds 300.5m sales of the with-profits bond which
was launched during the year. Worldwide single premiums grew 55 per cent to
Pounds 1.05bn.
L&amp;G's worldwide single premiums increased from Pounds 535m to Pounds 693m,
if irregular bulk pension transfers are excluded. Its UK managed and
segregated fund business saw new monies rise from Pounds 854m to Pounds
2.23bn, thanks to heavy sales of its indexed funds.

<TEXT>
ELECTRON HOUSE, the Reigate-based distributor of electronic components which
has undergone substantial restructuring in the last few years, yesterday
reported a 44 per cent gain in interim pre-tax profits and is raising the
dividend.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 595,000 to Pounds 854,000 in the six months
to November 30, helped by higher sales, operating profits from continuing
operations, and lower interest.
Earnings per share were 1.68p (1.03p) and the interim dividend is up by 5
per cent to 1.05p (1.00p).
Sales from continuing operations increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 35.9m
(Pounds 29m) and generated Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 815,000) of operating
profits in the first half. Discontinued operations added sales of Pounds
10.6m (Pounds 31.1m) and Pounds 162,000 (Pounds 948,000) to operating
profits.
Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, said the results provided further evidence of the
benefits of the restructuring and were 'particularly encouraging' given the
prolonged depressed economic conditions.
He said:'These results demonstrate that we continue to increase market share
while maintaining tight control of overheads. Every sector of the group
increased its sales and profits in local currency over the same period last
year.'
The group completed the sale of its high volume, low margin Bytech computer
wholesaling business in August. The purchaser paid Pounds 5m for Pounds 4m
of net assets and assumed over Pounds 5m of bank borrowings.
As a result Mr Leigh said the group's borrowings had fallen to just under
Pounds 4m and gearing had been cut from more 110 per cent at the end of May
to between 30 and 40 per cent. Interest costs fell from Pounds 1.17m to
Pounds 732,000.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring benefits push up Electron
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRON HOUSE, the Reigate-based distributor of electronic components which
has undergone substantial restructuring in the last few years, yesterday
reported a 44 per cent gain in interim pre-tax profits and is raising the
dividend.
Helped by higher sales and operating profits from continuing operations, and
lower interest costs, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 595,000 to Pounds
854,000 in the six months ended November 30 1992.
Earnings per share grew to 1.68p (1.03p) and the interim dividend is being
increased by 5 per cent to 1.05p (1p) per share.
Sales from continuing operations increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 35.9m
(Pounds 29m) and generated Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 815,000) of operating
profits. Discontinued operations added sales of Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 31.1m)
and operating profits of Pounds 162,000 (Pounds 948,000).
Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, said the results provided further evidence of the
benefits of the restructuring and were 'particularly encouraging' given the
prolonged depressed economic conditions.
He said: 'These results demonstrate that we continue to increase market
share while maintaining tight control of overheads. Every sector of the
group increased its sales and profits in local currency over the same period
last year.' He said six of the group's remaining eight companies improved
their operating profit margins.
Although the UK market for electronic components grew by about 4 per cent in
1992, with flat demand for passive and electro-mechanical components and a 6
per cent increase in semiconductors, Electron captured market share as
component sales grew by 18 per cent.
Component companies in Australia and New Zealand also performed well,
although results in the first quarter were depressed in sterling terms by
the weakness of the Australian dollar.
Electron's two remaining systems companies, which both hold strong positions
in niche markets, also increased sales although profit growth lagged
expectations.
The group completed the sale of its high volume, low margin Bytech computer
wholesaling business in August. The purchaser paid Pounds 5m for Pounds 4m
of net assets and assumed over Pounds 5m of bank borrowings.
As a result, Mr Leigh said the group's borrowings had fallen to just under
Pounds 4m and gearing had been cut from more than 110 per cent at the end of
May to between 30 and 40 per cent. Interest costs in the first six months
fell to Pounds 732,000 (Pounds 1.17m).
Under new accounting rules the group recorded a Pounds 148,000 extraordinary
item in the first half. That reflected the difference between the Pounds
750,000 remaining goodwill previously written off to reserves on the
acquisition of the computer wholesaling group and the Pounds 602,000 profit
after costs and tax on its disposal.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wolverhampton warns of fall in beer sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 3 PER CENT decline in overall beer consumption this year was forecast
yesterday by Mr David Thompson, managing director of Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley
Breweries.
The fall in sales through pubs would be steeper, he said at the company's
annual meeting - 'that means there will continue to be many pub closures
across the country.'
Mr Thompson told shareholders that although the state of the economy was a
drag on beer consumption, the main impact on the business was now coming
from the decline in the numbers of 18 to 25 year-olds.
'Per head, this group spends both more money and more time in pubs than any
other section of the population; thus the decline of this group will have a
disproportionate effect on overall consumption and on drinking in pubs in
particular.'
National brewers, recovering from reorganisation, would pose a greater
competitive threat. 'Profit margins in the free trade and take-home sectors
will be under pressure throughout the year,' Mr Thompson said. '1993 will be
tough.'

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Dumas placing proposals as losses increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DUMAS Group, the USM-quoted food manufacturer which requested the suspension
of its shares last July pending financial clarification, has announced
proposals for a placing to raise up to Pounds 2m and a reorganisation and
reduction of capital.
The company also reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 970,000 for the year to
January 31 1992 against profits of Pounds 34,000 and further losses of
Pounds 847,000 (Pounds 162,000) in the six months to July 1992.
The directors propose to subdivide each existing 10p ordinary share into one
share of 2p and one deferred share of 8p. They propose to cancel the
deferred shares and reduce the share premium account to eliminate the
deficit on the profit and loss account.
The plans also include a placing of 938,750 cumulative redeemable 6 per cent
preference shares of Pounds 1 each at par and of up to 22.22m new ordinary
2p shares at 5p.
A change of name to John Lusty Group will also be put to shareholders.
On completion of the share issues, Mr Arne Bergbrant will stand down as
chief executive but will continue as non-executive chairman. A number of
other management changes will also take place.
Mr Bergbrant said that despite the disappointing results he was convinced
that following the proposed refinancing the company would be in a position
to capitalise on its potential.
Losses per share for the year to January amounted to 15.34p (0.34p earnings)
while for the six months period losses were 7.29p (3.71p).

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Matthew Clark rises 9% in difficult market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATTHEW CLARK, the British wines and mineral water producer, lifted first
half pre-tax profits 9 per cent to Pounds 2.42m in 'a recessionary trading
environment.'
Earnings per share for the six months to October 31 improved slightly from
16.4p to 16.5p and the interim dividend is raised from 6.5p to 6.75p.
Operating profit increased 21 per cent to Pounds 2.45m on turnover which
declined 2 per cent from Pounds 27.65m to Pounds 26.06m.
Sales of Strathmore Spring water, which the company acquired in May last
year, rose 23 per cent in a market which remained static during the latter
part of 1992, said Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive.
'Whilst we are confident that the UK market for bottled water will resume
growth as the economy improves, competition in the sector will remain
intense,' Mr Aikens added. 'We intend to build demand for Strathmore Spring
Water with substantially increased levels of marketing expenditure.'
Old England British sherry retained brand leadership in a market which grew
4 per cent compared with a 6 per cent decline in Spanish sherry sales. The
company increased market share in spite of the inroads into brand sales by
private label business. Stone's Original Ginger Wine performed well.
The company is investing Pounds 3m in its Barchester Winery, which should
improve quality, increase efficiency and provide better facilities for
product development, Mr Aikens said.
Cost reductions had been made in most areas of the business, particularly
production and distribution.
Mr Aikens said Christmas trading had ended satisfactorily after a slow
start. 'We expect our core British wine business to perform rather better
than the overall wines and spirits market for the rest of this financial
year but we envisage continued pressure on margins. Strathmore should
outperform the market as recent listings by multiple retailers and
wholesalers translate into sales.'

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: CIA to sign Italian equity-linking deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIA GROUP, the USM-quoted London-based media buying and planning group,
plans to sign by March an equity-linking deal with the privately-owned
Italian media company Medianetwork, joining the two for the purposes of
pan-European media buying.
CIA intends to issue shares to cover the deal. The initial consideration,
worth about Pounds 3m, will give shareholders of Blufin, parent of
Medianetwork, about 10 per cent of the enlarged share capital of CIA.
That stake could increase to a maximum of 18 per cent, depending on the
future profitability of Blufin.
Under the agreed terms, Blufin shareholders must keep the shares for a
minimum of 2 years; thereafter it will be allowed to sell 20 per cent of its
holdings a year.
CIA already works informally with other media-buying companies in Europe;
this is its first equity-linking deal. CIA's subsidiary, CIA International,
was specifically set up to handle accounts of multi-national clients, such
as Nike, Shell, Dunhill and Wrigleys.
CIA International now does all Nike's pan-European media buying. Nike has
increased its business with CIA to billings of Pounds 40m this year.
Blufin's pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31 1992 are expected to
be in the region of L1.5bn (Pounds 660,000). Analysts are forecasting a 22
per cent rise in CIA's 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.5m, with turnover
increased 30 per cent. Earnings per share are expected to grow 13 per cent
to 15.34p. CIA currently has cash reserves of about Pounds 10m.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Bellwether still set on winning Aberdeen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bellwether Exploration Company said yesterday that it remained convinced of
the merits of its proposed merger with Aberdeen Petroleum, which would
improve the marketability of both companies' shares.
On Monday, Aberdeen urged investors not to support the suggested swap of
3.75 Aberdeen shares for each of Nasdaq-quoted Bellwether's, saying there
was minimal marketability in the latter's stock.
Yesterday Bellwether used the same claim against its target.
It added that a merger would make considerable expertise available to
Aberdeen, through the services of Torch Energy Advisors, which manages
Bellwether's oil and gas assets worth Dollars 1.3bn.
Bellwether also stressed that 57 per cent of its shares are held by three
UK-based institutions.
Aberdeen's shares yesterday added  1/4 p to 11p.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals leave Kunick Pounds 12.5m in
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUNICK, the leisure company which recently sold a 50 per cent stake in its
nursing home business to County NatWest Ventures, plunged into the red last
year, amid unexpectedly high reorganisation charges and property
write-downs.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 12.9m left the fruit machine company with
pre-tax losses of Pounds 12.5m for the year to September 30 against a profit
last time of Pounds 8.6m. Sales fell by 6 per cent to Pounds 109.5m.
At the operating level, profits were hit by a Pounds 6.8m fall to Pounds
2.7m in the group's fruit machines business, once the cash cow which was to
have funded investment in the care services business. Overall operating
profits fell from Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 6.5m.
Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said 1992 had been the 'most difficult
(year) ever experienced in the UK amusement machine industry'. He blamed the
recession and the disruption caused by the restructuring of the brewing
industry following the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's inquiry into beer
supply.
The exceptional charges covered a range of Kunick's efforts to meet the
downturn, from a Pounds 5.4m write-down on property to Pounds 4.9m for the
closure of a cd/juke box manufacturing business. The setting up of the
nursing home joint venture resulted in costs of Pounds 2.6m.
Mr Burnett stressed the potential for Kunick following the care services
deal in October.
Debt had been cut from Pounds 47m to Pounds 10m, with gearing from 89 per
cent to 19 per cent. The reduction was achieved through the transfer to the
joint venture of Pounds 24m in bank borrowings, secured against the care
services assets, and the Pounds 12.5m paid by CNWV for the 50 per cent
stake. The chairman said the two investors intended to float the joint
venture, Goldsborough Holdings, within one to two years.
Mr Burnett said the visitor attractions business in France would be closed
down or sold. In March, Kunick sold its London and York Dungeon attractions
for a profit of Pounds 4m. This was offset, however, by a Pounds 3.4m
extraordinary write-down on the French attractions.
Losses per share were 7.61p (0.38p earnings).
COMMENT
Kunick has managed to survive thus far, leaving many to speculate that the
real danger has passed. Certainly the recent rise in the preference shares
add weight to that view. The question now, however, is whether one wants to
invest in a fruit machine business - even one as lightly geared as Kunick.
The upside depends on economic recovery. Although the potential for such an
operationally geared company could be good, it will never be quite as
exciting following the brewing shake-up. Kunick has had to give up its
quality earnings and growth to satisfy the bankers. Potential investors
might want some indication of a long-term business strategy before stepping
in. Forecasts range from break even to Pounds 2m pre-tax. Either way, the
shares are highly speculative.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Eleventh-hour rescue for Expedier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW CURTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPEDIER, the floundering ticket and box office computer group, announced an
eleventh- hour rescue package yesterday, based on a Pounds 4.5m share
placing, capital restructuring, and management revamp.
The deal will see Expedier, which has been living off extended bank
facilities since 1991, pay Pounds 2.6m for the remaining 50 per cent stake
in its ticket sales joint venture with Wembley, owners of the national
stadium and box office. Wembley will receive 260m shares, equivalent to an
18 per cent stake, while Expedier will take on the joint venture's debts.
Wembley also said yesterday it would not match first half pre-tax profits of
Pounds 2.5m in the second half. The shares fell 2 1/2 p to 17p.
Expedier's new-look business will be renamed The Ticketing Group, owning the
First Call and Keith Prowse ticket agencies, and Space Time Systems, the
computerised box office system (BOCS) supplier. Expedier will issue another
495m shares at 1p each on the basis of 18 new shares for every seven held.
The cash raised will reduce borrowings - which stood at Pounds 10.5m on
December 18 - by Pounds 1m.
Mr Richard Templeton, of advisers Richard Fleming, said Expedier would not
be able to stay in business without a capital injection. The deal amounted
to 'a reconstruction with a severe health warning'.
The group remained highly geared, reliant on another full year of non-demand
facilities provided by its bankers to meet working capital requirements. It
had to meet an outstanding preference dividend payment, and trading
conditions, with sluggish West End ticket sales, were 'uncertain'. Expedier
was yet to sell Medminster, its furniture hire subsidiary.
The rescue package was put together by a consortium including Mr Karl Sydow
and Mr Andrew Myers, directors of the former joint venture, now appointed
deputy chairman and finance director. Mr Clive Ng, a director of
entertainment and real estate companies in the US and Malaysia, provided
finance and joined the board as non-executive director along with Wembley
director Mr Alex McCrindle.
Expedier reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 573,000 (Pounds 1.42m) in
the half-year to June 30 on sharply lower turnover of Pounds 3.38m (Pounds
6.29m).

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Resort advance 11% to
Pounds 3.3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESORT HOTELS, which saw its share price collapse last year on uncertainty
about expansion plans, has announced an 11 per cent increase in interim
profits helped by acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2.92m to Pounds 3.25m in the six months to
October 31 as the group increased its portfolio of managed or owned hotels
by eight to 54. Mr Robert Feld, managing director, said Resort hoped to win
further management contracts this year, especially in areas like Manchester
where it is poorly represented.
Turnover increased 28 per cent to Pounds 9.76m (Pounds 7.62m). Occupancy
rates were stable at about 60 per cent while average room charges were
almost unchanged at just over Pounds 40.
A Pounds 20.6m rights issue last April, the fourth since the company floated
in 1988, almost eliminated year-end debt of Pounds 22m. However, there was a
Pounds 3.3m cash outflow during the period and Mr Feld said gearing would
again rise sharply once two planned acquisitions of BES-funded companies,
Country Resort Hotels and County Resort Hotels, were completed.
The purchases were cast into doubt when Resort's share price fell below 50p.
But the company had now agreed to buy Country Resort for Pounds 905,000 and
discussions with County Resort were continuing.
Earnings per share dropped from 3.61p to 2.8p, while the interim dividend is
maintained at 1.2p. The shares, which last year fell from over 80p to 19p
before recovering, fell 2p yesterday to 40p.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Airline seats market key area for OFT
review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the key areas to be examined in the Office of Fair Trading's review
of Airtours' bid for Owners Abroad is the future of the airline seat
wholesaling market.
According to independent tour operators, Owners Abroad's willingness to act
as a large-scale supplier of seats is essential to their viability. Their
argument, put crudely, is that he who controls the seats, controls the
business.
Airtours, on the other hand, says it would assess the profitability of the
business. Airline wholesaling, according to Mr David Crossland, Airtours
chairman, is riskier than selling holidays and might not continue on its
current scale within an expanded group.
If the bid were successful, Airtours says it would use more of the capacity
of Air 2000, Owners Abroad's successful charter airline, for its own
customers. As a result, fewer Air 2000 seats would be available in the pool
of seats which serves the independent tour operators.
And Airtours might do less general seat wholesaling - that is buying other
airlines' excess capacity and matching it with third party demand.
The two group's seat wholesaling businesses are vastly different in scale.
Airtours sells to third parties only about 40,000 seats, or less than 3 per
cent of the total number of holidays it sells a year.
Owners Abroad, by contrast, sells about 3m seats a year - about two thirds
with its holiday packages and about 1m seats to other tour operators.
Mr Crossland says that, in spite of the protests from the independent tour
operators, their access to seats is unlikely to change. The total pool of
charter seats would not shrink just because Air 2000 would be supplying more
of the enlarged group's own requirements.
He dismisses the operators' claim that they might effectively be denied
access to some regional airports. Other charterers, like Air UK, Monarch Air
and Caledonian, serve many of the UK's regional airports and would be able
to supply the seats no longer made available by Air 2000.
What is more, these companies have active seat brokering businesses and
would relish expanding to fill any gap left by a less active Airtours.
In the last year the charter market has also seen the arrival of Excalibur,
a small airline backed by 3i, the venture capital group, which caters mainly
for independent tour operators.
Mr Bob O'Donnell, Excalibur's managing director, says Owners Abroad offers
small tour operators flexibility, including the ability to buy a handful of
seats on different aircraft from a number of airports.
But there would be little to stop Excalibur expanding. 'If there was a
capacity shortage in the market because of this deal (a successful Airtours
bid), we would bring on new aircraft.'
Owners Abroad does not share this vision of flexibility.
Mr Roger Allard, chief executive of Owners Abroad Leisure, says the small
tour operators would not be able to persuade charter airlines to put on
extra capacity. They would lose the flexibility; and to some destinations,
the airlines would have difficulty getting extra landing slots.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Tuskar accuses dissident of hindering its
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TUSKAR, the Dublin-based oil and gas company, yesterday accused a
stockbroker and dissident shareholder of trying to hinder its strategy
through the hostile bid from fellow Irish resource group, Aminex.
'This approach represents another attempt by Mr John Lord to frustrate the
development of Tuskar under its recently reconstructed board', a statement
from the company read.
Mr Lord sought unsuccessfully to oust the recently appointed chairman, Mr
Duncan McGregor, at the annual meeting before Christmas.
His actions followed the sale of Tuskar's last asset - a 36 per cent stake
in a Colombian oil field to Coplex Resources, the Australian exploration
company which failed in a recommended bid for the Irish group. Tuskar, whose
shares have been suspended at 1p since August, is expected to have some
IPounds 5m in the bank if Coplex chooses to pay cash in the final tranche of
the deal, due in August.
Tuskar said there was little merit in the hostile offer of two Aminex shares
for 11 of its own.
Aminex said the offer would be withdrawn if shareholders approved Tuskar's
proposals to purchase a North Sea subsidiary of Bula Resources at the
extraordinary meeting on February 5.

Ladbroke said yesterday that it reached agreement last December to sell its
UK retail parks to a consortium of foreign investors for Pounds 80m.
It would not say how many sites were involved or who the buyers were.
Details of the sale would be provided on March 4, with the 1992 full-year
results.
The group said Pounds 65m of the purchase price was payable immediately,
with the remaining Pounds 15m deferred for a period it would not specify.
Ladbroke's shares rose 4p to 193p yesterday.

FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Coats makes agreed offer for Youghal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coats Viyella yesterday announced terms of an agreed bid for Youghal
Carpets, valuing the Irish group at IPounds 2.5m (Pounds 2.67m). Coats
already owns or has options over 90 per cent of Youghal's shares and says
that whatever the outcome of the bid Youghal's shares will be delisted.
The offer is 5p a share. Last week Coats took an option to buy 8.7m shares
in Youghal from Jaykeel Investments, a Channel Islands-based investment
group, for 3p a share.
Coats said that Youghal, for which it originally bid in 1987, had only been
able to trade because Coats had guaranteed some of its borrowings and 'to
survive at all it will require a significant injection of capital'.
Youghal's properties have been valued at Pounds 5.9m.
