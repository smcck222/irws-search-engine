FT  26 MAR 93 / Investors, donors ponder Indonesia's new cabinet: President
Suharto is steering the ship of state on a more anti-western course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING

<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the new Indonesian cabinet, named last week, will by now be
hunched over desks charting the country's course for the next five years.
They will be aware of anxious people - foreign donors, local businessmen,
international investors - looking on, following the replacement of the three
ministers who had, since 1988, steered the country's economy.
President Suharto ditched Mr Radius Prawiro, Mr JB Sumarlin and Mr Adrianus
Mooy. All three were western-educated, liked by donors and Christian,
notable in a country with an 87 per cent Moslem population.
Their removal has resulted in some bitter reaction.
'It reflects a more basic anti-western stance,' says the head of one foreign
broking house in Jakarta. 'Those who favoured reform have not been carried
over.'
His concern is that a shift towards a more Moslem oriented cabinet may
signal a slowing of economic deregulation and antipathy toward the World
Bank and other western advisers.
Economic policy since the early 1980s has been to exploit Indonesia's
comparative advantage of cheap labour to fuel an export-driven economy. In
its place, the government might turn to import substitution and the
nurturing of higher-technology industries through protection and state
subsidies.
But a dramatic change in policy is unlikely. As Mr Manu Bhaskaran, economic
research director of Crosby Securities, explains, incoming ministers
responsible for the economy maintain 'a sensible approach to economic
reform.'
'Last year Saleh Afiff (the new co-ordinating minister for the economy)
called vigorously for reform in areas which were considered taboo, such as
agriculture and food processing. These are the reforms foreign investors and
donors would like to see,' he says.
The rumoured antipathy of the new economic ministers to foreign advisers is
also overstated. Mr Mar'ie Muhammed, the finance minister, in his previous
post as director-general of tax took advice from, among others, the US
Internal Revenue Service.
Mr Sudradjat Djiwandono, the central bank governor with ministerial status,
is typical of Indonesia's economic technocrats. Educated in the US, he is an
economist by training and a former assistant to the co-ordinating minister
of economics.
While the stated aims of the three men to continue their predecessors'
policies should comfort reformers, the balance of the overall cabinet has
shifted toward those espousing greater state intervention.
Mr Afiff's desire to deregulate the agro-sectors has been made more
difficult by the transformation of the National Logistics Agency (Bulog) -
which regulates key commodities such as rice, flour, sugar, palm oil and
cement - into a full ministry.
He must also face fierce lobbying from private companies which have virtual
monopolies, granted by government, in the distribution and processing of
many commodities. Indeed, requests for favours from politically
well-connected companies are likely to increase with President Suharto
entering possibly his last term in office.
This could place the economic ministers under intolerable pressure. And as
one foreign adviser notes, if faced with a barrage of demands from vested
interests, the ministers may opt to 'roll over, play dead and not move
forward on economic reform.'
Playing dead, however, may be difficult given the presence of donor
agencies, which last year pledged Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.36bn) and are
increasingly concerned at the close relationship between government and some
private companies.
As a result, programmes which should receive donor support, such as
participation of private companies in power generation, are already becoming
matters of dispute.
Donor officials disapprove of the involvement of the Bimantara Group, led by
President Suharto's second son, in the Dollars 4bn Paiton power project and
the granting of a monopoly in power supply to five industrial estates in
Jakarta to a group of well-connected businessmen.
For ministers, however, to take the side of foreigners against domestic
companies can be easily portrayed as betraying national interests.
Ministers may be preoccupied with fending off criticism to the detriment of
policy making, a situation which bedevilled the last administration in its
final two years. As they take up office, therefore, the biggest challenge
facing Messrs Afiff, Muhammed and Djiwandono is to keep economic decisions
free of politics.

FT  26 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japan urged to take lead on export control
rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Japanese government yesterday received a report from a senior advisory
body urging the country to take a leading role in redefining rules on the
export of technology with potential military uses.
Once a target of criticism for inadequate export controls, Japan believes a
relatively good record more recently puts it in a strong position to lead
the debate on developing a new regime to prevent proliferation of
mass-destruction weapons.
The Security Export Control Committee report listed general recommendations
to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, to be responsible for
drawing up specific lists of countries and products needing to be
controlled.
The committee raises concerns about export of items not under the control of
the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) but
which may have military applications.
It questions the safety of the 'know' clause used by such countries as the
US, UK and Germany. If the exporter 'knows' technology may be used for
military purposes, official approval is needed. The report suggests tougher
controls are needed, 'based on clear and objective standards' not conditions
'such as whether the exporter knows how goods to be exported will be used'.

FT  26 MAR 93 / World Trade News: China takes on the world shipping market -
A new-found freedom from state controls will allow more commercial
flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA's merchant navy may still be some way from ruling the waves
commercially, but the recent 'corporatisation' of the China Ocean Shipping
company seems certain to lead to a more aggressive Chinese presence in world
shipping.
Mr Zhang Da Chun, executive vice-president of the newly-constituted China
Ocean Shipping Companies Group, said in an interview that the freeing of
Cosco from state control would allow it more flexibility to pursue its core
shipping interests and develop activities in banking, finance, insurance and
real estate.
A priority was to expand and modernise Cosco's fleet to include the new
generation of container ships, and add a number of smaller dry-cargo
vessels. Some would be built in China, but Cosco would be guided by the
market. 'If it is cheaper and better, we will buy abroad, but all things
being equal, we will buy in China.'
China, with 20m dwt, ranks ninth in total world merchant shipping tonnage,
but fourth in container-ship capacity. Cosco, dwarfing China's 200-or-so
shipping companies combined, has over 600 vessels on its register, or some
15m dwt, and is the world's largest shipping conglomerate.
Mr Zhang said the freeing of Cosco from direct central bureaucratic control
represented an enormous chance for the shipping concern. 'We will now have
much more power in our own hands. Before, if we wanted to buy ships, we were
obliged to win the permission not only of the ministry of communications,
but also the state planning commission.'
Cosco, with 60,000 employees, will have some 80 companies under its umbrella
at home and abroad, whose activities range from providing bunkering
facilities at China's ports to the country's largest road transport company.
Its plans to extend the range of its business activities include
establishing a bank and trading corporation, along with redevelopment of
some of its valuable real estate which includes hotels in Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Qingdao.
It is also investing in container Port No. 8 in Hong Kong, and is planning
to develop its own container terminals in the British colony and elsewhere.
Other avenues for expansion include an extension of its bunkering
operations, ship repair and maintenance facilities, and agency business.
Mr Zhang indicated Cosco was interested in foreign acquisitions. 'Maybe in
the future we will buy into foreign shipping lines. We are also planning
closer co-operation with other shippers to try to ensure market stability.'
Cosco was seeking to increase the scope and range of its activities, he
added, partly because of difficulties in the financially 'risky' shipping
business, including relatively low returns on investment of around 3-5 per
cent. Business was especially tough in China these days, because of big
increases in stevedoring and other costs.
Mr Zhang firmly rejected complaints by international shipping companies that
China was a difficult market to break into. Foreign shippers complain about
restrictions on cargoes that might be carried in non-Chinese bottoms, and
also about difficulties posed by bureaucratic interference at Chinese ports.
Last year, Mr Zhang said, some 200m tons of imports and exports were cleared
through China's ports, of which Cosco shifted 50-60m tons. But he also
observed that the volume would be much greater if capacity was increased.
This in turn would depend to an extent on foreign investors such as Hong
Kong tycoons who were starting to play a more active role in China's port
development.
Mr Zhang was vague about Cosco's expansion financing plans, but he indicated
that the company was considering a bond issue and was also talking about
seeking a listing on the Shenzen or Shanghai exchanges to raise additional
capital. He described the present level of borrowing as 'manageable' without
providing details.

FT  26 MAR 93 / World Trade News: World shipbuilding output reaches higest
level in 15 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD shipbuilding output reached its highest level in 15 years in 1992,
latest figures from the London-based Lloyd's Register of Shipping* show,
Richard Tomkins writes. Completions totalled 18.6m gross tonnes, 2.5m grt up
on the previous year. The output reflects the peak in orders ahead of the
present recession. Since then, orders have slumped: yesterday's figures show
new orders exceeding deliveries by 5.8m grt last year.
Biggest shipbuilding nations last year were Japan, with output of 7.6m grt,
and South Korea, (4.8m grt), followed by Germany (903,555 grt), Taiwan
(698,000 grt) and Denmark (599,878 grt). China was ninth with 360,735 grt.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is quietly expanding its focus from 'gridlocked'
Washington to the deadlocked Uruguay Round with the intention of completing
negotiations by the end of this year.
The president's meeting today with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is seen as
crucial to the success of the final push. So will be the Tokyo summit of the
Group of Seven top industrial powers in July.
Trade officials from the 'quad' (the US, EC, Canada and Japan) met this week
to lay out a work programme in the hope of achieving substantive progress
for the summit. The focus was market access issues, key to both the Round's
conclusion and Congressional approval.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, has been assembling a new
domestic team, generally described as bright, aggressive, and politically
astute. Although largely untested in the trade arena, all too soon it must
cope with the most complex and intractable trade talks.
Among the neophytes is Mr John Schmidt, a Chicago mergers and acquisitions
lawyer, whose appointment to succeed Mr Warren Lavorel as US co-ordinator
for multilateral negotiations is still unofficial. Mr Schmidt, who is
reported to have been studying up his new brief, was a campaign fund raiser.
It is not clear when he would take up his new duties; Mr Lavorel is tipped
to succeed Mr Charles Carlyse as Gatt's deputy director-general in Geneva,
probably in June.
Mr Rufus Yerxa, Deputy US Trade Representative in Geneva, will provide the
only continuity in the political appointments, moving to Washington in the
Number Two trade spot, and working initially on the side agreements for the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
Ms Charlene Barshefsky, an international trade lawyer, will bring to the
Number Three job a thorough knowledge of the issues. She is being
criticised, however unfairly, for having represented companies in Mexico,
Canada and Japan.
The agreement between the US and the EC to negotiate an expanded market
access package is highly satisfactory to US industries comprising the Zero
Tariff Coalition, which had to battle both Gatt officials and the US
government for recognition that manufacturing needed concrete benefits from
the Round.
The industries, including paper, wood products, non-ferrous metals, account
for about 30 per cent of the US merchandise trade, but they are facing
significantly higher tariff barriers than their competitors.
US officials seem resigned to accepting the farm trade deal, negotiated by
Mrs Carla Hills, former US Trade Representative, and EC trade officials last
November. But they are insisting that agricultural products - both processed
and raw commodities - be included in a comprehensive market access package
to compensate the US farm sector for its slight gains thus far.

FT  26 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Italy warned on disrupting single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday warned Italy not to disrupt the
barrier-free internal European market by unilaterally imposing quotas on
parallel imports of shoes, ceramics and silks from other EC member states.
Mr Claudio Vitalone, Italian trade minister, has written to Sir Leon
Brittan, EC trade commissioner, seeking to restrict the entry of goods made
in state trading countries such as China, Vietnam and North Korea which are
re-exported to Italy from Britain, the Netherlands and Germany.
If Italy wanted to enforce such quotas it would almost certainly have to
reimpose border checks on goods from other EC member states. The problem
arises because EC ministers have so far failed to agree plans to scrap or
harmonise national quotas on non-EC imports.
A spokesman for Sir Leon said the letter promised liberalisation of hundreds
of quantitative curbs on products from other non-EC countries. The
Commission would welcome the lifting of restraints, but warned Italy to
stick to EC rules if it wanted to establish new quotas.
But any attempt to establish internal EC quotas using Article 115 of the EC
treaty would be 'completely against the single market'. Italy is reserving
the right to use Article 115, even though the lifting of barriers on January
1 should have made it obsolete. 'It would amount to the re-erection of
national borders, exactly what the single market tries to avoid.'
Sir Leon has opened legal proceedings against Britain, the Netherlands and
Germany for unilaterally abolishing or extending national quotas on goods
from state trading countries. But he believes parallel imports are a natural
and desirable part of the single market. The Commission is examining
Britain's response to its request for more information on its quotas, and is
awaiting replies from the Germans and Dutch.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Germans reduce Treasury bill rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURES inside the European exchange rate mechanism eased again yesterday
after the Bundesbank surprised some currency dealers by announcing a large
cut in the interest rate of one of its money market instruments.
The Bundesbank cut the interest rate on its 3-day Treasury bill by 90 basis
points to 7.5 per cent.
The move came a week after the Bundesbank cut its discount rate by 50 basis
points, also to 7.5 per cent.
Some dealers described the move as a significant easing of policy by the
Bundesbank because the Treasury bill rate is sometimes seen as marking the
effective floor for all rates in the German cash market rates.
Mr Jonathan Hoffman, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in London,
said the cut was significant because the cost of borrowing D-Marks overnight
has been at comparatively high levels recently.

FRENCH conservatives stepped up their efforts yesterday to curb the
influence of Mr Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist president, over the
government which they will form after Sunday's second round of parliamentary
elections.
Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the neo-Gaullist Republican Rally (RPR), which
emerged as the biggest single party in the first round last Sunday,
challenged Mr Mitterrand's claims on policymaking. He said in an interview
with Le Figaro newspaper that the conservatives 'did not intend to share
power with defunct socialism, but would exercise their responsibilities to
the full'.
The RPR leader, who has this week led conservative calls for the president
to resign, is anxious to avoid a repetition of the last cohabitation between
1986 and 1988, when he was prime minister and Mr Mitterrand repeatedly
outmanoeuvred the conservatives.
Mr Chirac said the conservatives planned to control areas of policy
traditionally deemed to fall to the president, notably defence and foreign
affairs. He said this could involve France taking a more active role within
Nato.
Meanwhile, Mr Mitterrand, who has fiercely rejected calls to resign, has
begun protecting his position. A number of French newspapers yesterday
published leaks from the president's staff of comments by him at the last
socialist cabinet meeting on Wednesday.
He is reported to have said he would not allow the conservatives to 'isolate
me, lock me up in a rat-trap, or slit my throat in the dark' and to have
warned that the return of the right would herald social chaos. 'When the
suburbs go up in flames, you will see riot police hitting young people,' he
was quoted as saying.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Tribunal rejects plea to release Fiat executives
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MILAN civil liberties tribunal yesterday rejected requests for the release
of two top Fiat executives held in prison since February 22 on charges of
corruption.
The tribunal accepted prosecution arguments that the two men, Mr Francesco
Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, and Mr Antonio Mosconi, head
of Toro, the Turin car group's insurance arm, were liable to influence the
course of justice if released.
The decision is a blow to Fiat since Mr Mattioli is one of the four top
members of the group's management structure following a reorganisation last
December. It underlines Milan magistrates' determination to press charges
against the two men concerning alleged payments of L1.8bn (Pounds 821,000)
by Cogefar-Impresit, Fiat's construction subsidiary, during the building of
Milan's metro. Both Mr Mattioli and Mr Mosconi have served on the
Cogefar-Impresit board.
Mr Vittorio Chiusano, Fiat's lawyer, commented after the decision: 'There
was not much hope the request would be received.' Last May Mr Enzo Papi,
chief executive of Cogefar-Impresit, was arrested on similar charges and
held for 55 days in prison until he confessed. Mr Papi's confession, with
that of a Christian Democrat politician, are now being used in allegations
against Mr Mattioli and Mr Mosconi.
In other developments yesterday, Mr Giuseppe Santoro, a diplomat formerly in
charge of overseas aid at the foreign ministry, was arrested on charges of
extortion and abuse of office. His arrest is part of an investigation by
Rome magistrates into alleged misuse of foreign aid, especially to
Bangladesh, Somalia and Sudan that already involves Mr Gianni de Michelis,
the former foreign secretary.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Elections '93: Paris guessing game for
hopefuls - Uncertainty over the final result is fuelling debate on the
cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S national election debate is fast giving way now to the Paris
parlour game about who will get which cabinet jobs in the new centre-right
government next week.
It is not yet a betting man's game because there are still too many
uncertainties. It is not absolutely sure - though very probable - that the
neo-Gaullist Republican Rally (RPR) will get more seats than its Union for
French Democracy (UDF) partner in Sunday's run-off ballot. If it does, it
seems certain that President Mitterrand will have to pick an RPR prime
minister. The clear choice is Mr Edouard Balladur, a former finance
minister, rather than Gaullist leader, Mr Jacques Chirac. The latter clearly
does not want to repeat his 1986-88 stint as prime minister and wants to
keep his hands free to reach for the presidency itself.
If, perchance, the UDF were to come out of Sunday's run-off level with or
above the RPR, then its leader, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, would be in the
same predicament as his rival, Mr Chirac, and would probably also steer
clear of the Hotel Matignon, the premier's residence.
Another uncertainty is what, if any, influence President Mitterrand has on
cabinet jobs, especially those in foreign and defence policy where the
constitution gives the president a role. In 1986, when he was far stronger
politically, Mr Mitterrand was said to have vetoed Mr Francois Leotard,
leader of the Republican party affiliated to the UDF, as defence minister.
But according to Elysee officials, Mr Chirac exaggerated the president's
reservations because the RPR prime minister himself preferred to have a
technocrat rather than an ambitious political rival such as Mr Leotard in
the defence job. The reality may thus be that Mr Mitterrand's influence will
depend on divisions between the new governing parties.
Mr Balladur would ideally like someone apolitical such as Mr Jacques De
Larosiere, the present Bank of France governor, as finance minister so as to
exert maximum influence himself over that post. But there are too few good
jobs to satisfy a power-hungry coalition for the second most important post
in the government to be filled this way. The finance portfolio is thus
likely to go to the UDF federation. Mr Edmond Alphandery, who recently
refused Mr Mitterrand's offer of one of France's European commissionerships,
wants the job.
But he may have to fight the leader of his Christian Democrat party, Mr
Pierre Mehaignerie, for it. Another prominent UDF politician, Mr Alain
Madelin, has ruled himself out of the finance ministry by advocating a
floating of the franc, but may wind up with labour or transport.
Whoever wins the finance ministry will not lord it over the ministers of
budget and industry in the way that Mr Pierre Beregovoy once did as
Socialist finance minister; individual budget and industry fiefs could well
go to the RPR. More important, the foreign and defence ministries look like
ending up in RPR hands. Mr Alain Juppe, secretary general of the RPR,
fancies the Quai d'Orsay, despite Mr Chirac's desire to stay in his present
job to organise the Chirac presidential campaign.
A crustier Gaullist, Mr Charles Pasqua, is touting himself for defence. With
perhaps the 1986 precedent in mind, Mr Pasqua has been moderating his tone
in recent weeks towards Mr Mitterrand.
It is, in theory, of some importance to France's EC partners that the UDF,
the more pro-European wing of the new governing coalition, should control
agriculture and the junior Quai d'Orsay job of responsibility for EC
affairs. It may well do so. Mr Philippe Vasseur, a former economics
journalist, is gunning for the former, and Mr Bernard Bosson, mayor of
Annecy, would like another crack at the EC affairs post he filled in
Chirac's government.
But in practice, the predelictions of the UDF and some of its members may
have to take second place to the tough rhetoric against the European
Commission's farm and trade policies, on which Mr Chirac has fought the
parliamentary elections and will be conducting his presidential campaign.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Mr Pacini Battaglia: Correction
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a report of developments in the Italian corruption scandal in the
Financial Times on March 16 it was said that Mr Pierfrancesco Pacini
Battaglia was under arrest. We are asked to say that he is not under arrest,
is not charged with any offence and is co-operating with the Italian
authorities of his own volition.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Fiat executives stay in prison

<TEXT>
A MILAN civil liberties tribunal yesterday rejected requests for the release
of two top Fiat executives held in prison since February 22 on charges of
alleged corruption.
The tribunal accepted prosecution arguments that the two men, Mr Francesco
Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, and Mr Antonio Mosconi, head
of Toro, the Turin car group's insurance arm, were liable to influence the
course of justice if released.
The decision is a blow to Fiat since Mr Mattioli is one of the four top
members of the group's management structure following a reorganisation last
December. It is also underlines the determination of Milan magistrates to
press charges against the two men for their alleged involvement in the
payment of L1.8bn (Pounds 821,000) in kick-backs by Cogefar-Impresit, Fiat's
construction subsidiary, during the building of Milan's metro. Both Mr
Mattioli and Mr Mosconi have served on the Cogera-Impresit board.
Mr Vittorio Chiusano, Fiat's lawyer, commented wryly after the decision:
'There was not much hope how the request would be received. He (Mr Mattioli)
knew very well how the law was practised in Milan.' Last May Mr Enzo Papi,
chief executive of Cogefar-Impresit, was arrested on similar charges and
held for 55 days in prison until he confessed. Mr Papi's confession, along
with that of a Christian Democrat politician, are now being used in
allegations against Mr Mattioli and Mosconi.
In other developments in Italy's corruption scandals yesterday, Mr Giuseppe
Santoro, a senior diplomat formerly in charge of overseas aid at the foreign
ministry, was arrested on charges of alleged extortion and abuse of office.
His arrest is part of a wide-ranging investigation by Rome magistrates into
the misuse of foreign aid, especially to Bangladesh, Somalia and Sudan that
already involves Mr Gianni de Michelis, the former foreign secretary.
Yesterday it was revealed that the latter's private secretary, Ms Barbar
Coelin, was wanted for questioning.
Also explosive developments are expected shortly in Naples where a series of
confessions by local politicians has led to the naming of some of the city's
most influential businessmen and political figures.
This week police have carried out a series of unprecedented searches of the
offices of all the main parties in Naples. The city's magistrates are
understood to be following seven separate lines of investigation of which
the most important are misuse of funds following the 1980 Irpinia
earthquake, the construction of a metro system and development related to
the 1990 World Cup football competition.
Neapolitan politics have been based upon the biggest network of patronage in
the country.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Who gives what in the aid stakes - The
trail of western assistance to the CIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL support for Russia is back on the international economic agenda.
It now seems likely that finance and foreign ministers from the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations will meet after Easter to discuss
additional help for economic reform in Russia.
Such a meeting could prove difficult. As expectations of new financial
support for Russia have been rising, so have doubts over the efficacy of
such action. In G7 capitals, officials are seeking to play down expectations
of massive financial support and shift the debate to low cost and possibly
more effective micro-economic measures such as help for small businesses and
privatisation.
The issue of new assistance for Russia could also expose tensions among the
G7 nations if the question of a fair sharing of the west's burden emerges in
the talks.
The burden sharing issue has cast a cloud over past G7 meetings on help for
former Soviet republics. Germany, in particular, feels it has borne too much
of the cost. Officials in Bonn say Germany has provided DM80bn (Pounds
33.8bn) in cash and guarantees for credits for Russia since 1989, more than
half the western total.
One cause of misunderstanding is uncertainty about the scale of western
support for Russia. Institutions such as the European Commission and the
International Monetary Fund publish figures as do national governments. But
they are difficult to reconcile with one another and provide only part of
the picture.
The Commission, for example, has published detailed estimates of commitments
made by the EC, its member states, other countries and institutions since
September 1990 to former Soviet republics.
They show, for example, that the total commitments of the EC and its member
states of Ecu52.4bn (Pounds 43bn) in the period amounted to 70.6 per cent of
promised global assistance. There is a wide divergence among member states'
contributions, with Germany providing 53.2 per cent against the UK's 0.63
per cent.
But the EC figures do not provide a breakdown for each former Soviet
republic. Nor do they say how much has been disbursed or the scale of debt
rescheduling or grants from private sources. The Commission says the
commitments may take some years to fulfil.
The IMF in Washington collates information from western donors and creditors
and Russia itself and has disclosed some overall figures on disbursements.
But it refuses to say what individual western member governments are doing.
Many governments are reluctant to disclose up-to-date figures, and still
less to place them on a comparable basis with the efforts of others.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris has a
mandate from its 24 industrialised member governments to record flows of
concessionary assistance, other official financing and private capital flows
to the former communist countries.
The OECD has virtually completed its figures for flows to the former Soviet
Union in 1991 and hopes to publish these soon, providing it gets the
go-ahead from member governments. The earliest estimated time of arrival for
1992 figures is mid 1993.
In this climate it is hardly surprising that controversy surrounds the
Dollars 24bn of staged financial assistance and debt relief pledged at last
year's G7 economic summit in Munich in support of President Boris Yeltsin's
reforms and political leadership. In Russia, there is a widespread belief
that funds pledged in Munich have not been forthcoming.
Figures obtained from the IMF and several western governments this week
suggest that the G7 has gone some way to meeting its Munich pledge - but not
exactly in the way promised.
G7 bilateral assistance totalled around Dollars 12.2bn in 1992 - slightly
more than the Dollars 11bn promised. Financial support from the IMF and
World Bank amounted to Dollars 1.06bn, which was well below the Dollars
4.5bn pledged, reflecting Russia's inability to meet IMF conditions. A
promised Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund was not put in place because
of adverse economic conditions in Russia.
However, the G7 countries were more generous than planned in providing debt
relief. While the Munich package envisaged rescheduling of Dollars 2.5bn,
overall debt relief last year was about Dollars 7.2bn, although most of this
resulted from Russia failing to meet its obligations.
The role of individual G7 countries in the total Dollars 20.5bn of support
is less clear. The US Treasury says it provided Dollars 2.1bn, Dollars 100m
more than planned. Its contribution comprised Dollars 1.54bn of export
credits for food, Dollars 218m in humanitarian assistance and Dollars 350m
in export credits to enable Russia to buy US goods.
The German finance ministry says it has provided up to DM5bn of guarantees
to enable Russia to buy German goods on credit. Britain's share of the
Dollars 24bn package is obscure. But Britain has provided Pounds 441m of
assistance in the form of know-how, export credits and emergency animal feed
supplies to Russia over the past two years as well as its share of EC and
IMF support.
The true state of western support for Russia is unclear to experts who have
been monitoring the flows for years. Mr Keith Savard, chief economist of the
Washington-based Institute for International Finance, says he believes
international financial institutions such as the IMF also have no precise
idea of actual support for Russia because they rely partly on data supplied
by Russia. Mr Savard believes the IMF-based figures of disbursements to
Russia from the 1992 G7 package are too high.
The uncertainty should be taken seriously by the G7, Mr Savard believes.
'When considering what the G7 and others might do for Russia, we ought to
know first what they have done,' he says.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Russia in Turmoil: Fyodorov proposes another dose of shock
therapy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE Russian government's proposed list of dramatic economic measures
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
unveiled under presidential rule - represent a new round of 'shock therapy'
after a long period during which many financial stabilisation measures have
been blocked.
The measures, put forward by Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister for
economy and finance, include:
A six month moratorium on the payment of all foreign debt as long as the
measures in the draft programme are in force. Russia has paid neither
interest nor principal on its Dollars 80bn foreign debt for several months.
It was not clear last night if the proposal superseded an earlier offer to
repay Dollars 3.5bn this year.
Rigid limits on credit advanced by the central bank, seen by the government
as the main engine of inflation. The Russian information agency said credit
would grow by no more than 40 per cent in the first quarter, 30 per cent in
the second and 15 per cent in the third and fourth quarters.
Raising bank interest rates to 8 per cent a month from 80 per cent a year
(though much credit is advanced at lower rates).
The creation of a Dollars 3bn fund to stabilise the rouble - drawn from the
tiny stock of foreign currency and from international credits. This suggests
that Mr Fyodorov wants to move swiftly to attempt to stabilise the rouble
without the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, whose Dollars 6bn
fund has never been granted because conditions were not judged to be right.
Simplification of the system under which land can be sold to citizens.
An increase in the minimum state wage to Rbs4,500 a month (about Dollars 7)
and indexing savings in the state savings bank. The current minimum wage is
around Rbs3,000.
According to the Interfax news agency, Mr Fyodorov told the cabinet it must
blend 'popular and unpopular measures', with its eyes fixed firmly in the
proposed referendum on April 25. He was quoted as saying that it was
important not to upset the vote on April 25, since the national plebiscite
was the key to reforms.

crisis

<TEXT>
AFTER a week of intense political manoeuvring the main centres of power in
Russia find themselves operating outside the constitution. If a compromise
can be reached involving President Yeltsin, parliament, the Congress of
People's Deputies and the Constitutional Court, it will be between
politicians unsure of their authority and the validity of the agreements
they may sign.
Into this vacuum, other forces are rushing, seeking to take advantage of an
increasingly lawless space.
The radical democrats, Mr Yeltsin's traditional power base, still support
him because they have nowhere else to go. Yet, as Mr Yuri Afanasiev of the
radical Civil Initiative Group said on Wednesday, they fear that Mr
Yeltsin's call for a national popular vote on his presidency and a new
constitution is merely another 'political bargaining chip' to be cashed in
for yet another compromise.
For the hardline communists and nationalists, still demanding Mr Yeltsin's
impeachment yesterday, in spite of the apparent turn-around on the issue by
the parliamentary speaker, Mr Ruslan Kasbulatov, the president must be
removed because of his continued espousal of radical market reform.
The revived Communist party, which has a number of determined politicians in
its leadership, has identified the popular dissatisfaction with reform as
their main political weapon and will pursue this whether or not Mr Yeltsin
survives any vote today
But the centrist group now appears not to have the will to pursue Mr Yeltsin
to this conclusion. Mr Khasbulatov's breathtaking throwaway remark yesterday
that 'frankly speaking, I'm no supporter of impeachment' shows that he
reckons he has not got the votes for it.
He is probably preparing to hobble Mr Yeltsin through the use of stripping
him of his powers if he oversteps his authority.
The centrist position was rehearsed in yesterday's Rossiskaya Gazeta by Mr
Alexander Vladislavlev, deputy head of the Union of Industrialists and
chairman of the 'Obnovleniye' (Renewal) party. Playing down the issue which
has convulsed Russian political life, Mr Vladislavlev said reform was
proceeding in enterprises large and small, and that a government of national
unity was needed.
The centrists really are centrists. They recoil from the radical reform of
Mr Yeltsin's cabinet. But, when push comes to shove, they recoil also from
the fury of the hardliners. They wish to constrain, but not to dismiss, the
president.
A common position now emerges - the call, voiced by Mr Vladislavlev, by the
trade unions, by leaders of autonomous republics and the regions for
elections for a president and for a parliament. So fluid is the political
situation that almost every group believes it has a chance to improve its
position.

<TEXT>
YAKUTIA, the biggest and richest republic within the Russian federation, is
waiting to see whether pro- or anti-Yeltsin forces will win the impeachment
vote today in the Congress of People's Deputies.
'We are waiting to see which side will turn out to be right,' jokes Mr
Gavriil Struchkov, editor of a liberal newspaper, Sakhada (Land of the
Yakuts). Some 6,000km north-east of Moscow, Yakutia - or Sakha, as it
prefers to call itself - has much at stake in the showdown between President
Boris Yeltsin and the parliament.
A statement by the local republican government and parliamentary leaders on
Monday simply condemned power struggles in Moscow without blaming Mr Yeltsin
or Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker.
But some local reformists said yesterday that a victory for parliament would
give the cautious Yakut leadership a freer hand to reverse economic reforms.
This is already happening as a continuing fall in production and raging
inflation are being blamed on privatisation, said Mr Fedot Tumusov, head of
parliament's committee for market reforms and entrepreneurship.
'A year ago I would have doubted reforms could fade,' said Mr Vladimir
Danilov, deputy chairman of the state privatisation committee. But he said
that Mr Mikhail Nikolayev, the Yakut president, had recently supported a
decision to weaken his committee by splitting it into two. Only one
privatisation auction, offering shares for vouchers distributed to the
entire population, had been held so far.
Mr Danilov said that if Mr Yeltsin was again defeated at today's Congress,
it would only be a matter of time before Mr Anatoly Chubais, the energetic
Russian privatisation minister, was removed and his mass privatisation
strategy dumped.
However, if strong presidential rule and energetic reforms were pursued by
the centre, there would be less leeway, indeed less incentive, for Sakha to
go its own way. A failure to stabilise Russia's finances and restructure the
economy could encourage rich regions like Yakutia to introduce their own
currencies and withhold diamonds and taxes from the centre.
The producer of 98 per cent of Russia's diamonds and the third largest
source of gold, Yakutia has pushed autonomy to the limits promised but never
granted under the old communist system. But while declaring its sovereignty
and introducing Yakut citizenship alongside Russian nationality, the
1m-strong republic has also pledged to remain part of the Russian
federation.
Mr Vasily Alexeyev, chairman of the Yakut parliament's natural resources
committee, said his republic now had a fair deal for sharing its diamonds
and gold with Moscow. But he said it was important to recognise that Yeltsin
was fighting a very real threat of a communist counter-coup. 'The many
former communists who are talented professionals are needed, but others who
just want to return things to the way they were before are very dangerous,'
said Mr Alexeyev, a biologist who never joined the party. 'Everywhere the
fate of democracy will depend on how quickly they are neutralised.'
However, his namesake, Mr Artur Alexeyev, first secretary of the newly
revived local communist party, had no qualms about declaring that Yakutia
had been better off under communist rule. 'At least then we didn't have
poverty. The Soviet regime also gave us our own Yakut state.' He wants fresh
elections for parliament and president alike, saying neither side had
carried out its promises for a better life.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Industrial output set to rise, says CBI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH manufacturing industry expects to increase output over the next four
months following a recovery in order books to their best levels since the
summer of 1990, according to the Confederation of British Industry.
In its latest monthly survey of industrial trends, the CBI said output
expectations 'are now clearly positive', having increased for three months
in succession.
The CBI's latest UK economic forecast, also published today, points to the
first economic recovery led by manufacturing industry since the late 1960s.
CBI officials warned, however, that it was too early to celebrate the end of
the recession. More than 40 per cent of companies still consider their order
books are below normal while nearly one in four says its stocks of finished
goods are more than adequate to meet demand.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, welcomed evidence of improved home
and export demand 'as another indication that the economy may now be growing
again'.
But he warned that the sharp deterioration in economic trends on the
Continent meant 'we cannot yet be sure that the recession is over'.
The CBI polled 1,413 companies employing about 2m people in 50 different
industries between February 26 and March 17. Nearly all replied before last
week's Budget.
The survey found that 26 per cent of companies expect to increase output
over the next four months compared with 16 per cent anticipating a decrease
and 58 per cent saying they would keep output unchanged. The positive
balance of 10 per cent of companies expecting to increase production was the
best result since May last year.
According to Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's economics director, the survey's
findings on output were consistent with a rise in UK manufacturing
production in the second quarter of this year.
For the whole of this year, the CBI expects manufacturing output to grow by
1.6 per cent compared with its forecast of 1.4 per cent growth in UK gross
domestic product. Looking ahead to 1994, the employers' organisation expects
manufacturing production will rise by 2.8 per cent compared with an expected
rise of 2.4 per cent in GDP.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Government to save 12 pits: British Coal told to start
preparations for industry's privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday instructed British Coal immediately to begin
preparations for privatisation as it unveiled plans by the company to
reprieve 12 of 31 threatened pits and provide a hope of rescue for another
seven.
Another 12 pits where British Coal intends to stop mining will be offered to
the private sector to run along with the seven mothballed pits. Legislation
for full privatisation is likely to be brought forward in the next
parliamentary session for implementation in 1995.
Presenting a white paper on coal, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, told the House of Commons that the private sector would play a
critical role in the coal industry. 'We believe that privatisation is the
only way of enabling this industry to take full advantage of the
opportunities the market offers.'
The government's partial climbdown over pit closures means that an
additional 5,800 jobs will be lost in the short term on top of 8,000 miners
who have taken redundancy since last October. The total of nearly 14,000 job
losses compares with more than 30,000 which were expected when the
government announced its original pit closures plan last October.
The revised plan was attacked by supporters of the coal industry and unions
which viewed it as a short-term fix which would provide only a temporary
reprieve for most of the 12 pits as it failed to create more room in the
energy market for coal.
Mr Norman Willis, Trades Union Congress general secretary, described the
white paper as a 'deliberate deception' and said it signalled the demise of
the coal industry. 'The reality is that 18 pits will shut down immediately
and the remainder will be closed within two years.'
Mr Heseltine announced that the electricity industry had agreed to buy 160m
tonnes of coal over five years from British Coal. He expected the deals to
be signed by the end of March. He also committed the government to
subsidise, by an unspecified amount, additional sales by British Coal to the
electricity industry. The subsidy would bridge the gap with world prices but
would last only until privatisation.
The trade and industry select committee suggested in January that up to
Pounds 500m would be needed over five years to subsidise tonnages above base
contracts. Yesterday's white paper was imprecise, saying the government
would embrace the committee's range of figures for subsidies.
The generators are discussing the size of extra contracts with British Coal
but are resisting anything above 40m tonnes over five years. That would
provide a future for a few of the 12 pits.
Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, would not predict how many of the 12
reprieved pits would last following a market testing exercise to determine
extra sales. Negotiations will be complicated by the government's decision
to encourage the private coal-mining sector which will increase competition.
Mr Heseltine also announced that the Connah's Quay gas project in north
Wales and two smaller gas projects should be allowed to go ahead. These
projects would involve investment of over Pounds 2bn and would lead to the
creation of over 5,000 construction jobs, he said.
They will further erode the potential market for coal. In addition, Mr
Heseltine said the market for coal would diminish for environmental reasons.
The European Commission gave its broad approval to the white paper after
telephone discussions between Mr Heseltine and the two commissioners
responsible for the sector, Mr Abel Matutes, energy commissioner, and Mr
Karel Van Miert, who is in charge of competition policy.
The detailed programme will still have to be submitted to the Brussels
authorities and receive the formal approval of all 17 commissioners.
Mr Heseltine announced that two pits - Bolsover in Derbyshire and Sharleston
in Yorkshire - would close because of 'impending exhaustion'. Ten pits where
production has already ceased will not reopen.
COAL WHITE PAPER: THE MAIN POINTS
Twelve pits to be closed, 12 to be reprieved, six to be mothballed, one to
have development work only.
Generators to buy 160m tonnes over five years from British Coal; government
to subsidise additional sales.
Privatisation of British Coal to be speeded up.
Subsidies to be phased out before privatisation; all pits to be offered for
sale or lease before being closed.
Total of Pounds 200m to help areas affected by closure.
Magnox nuclear power stations to be kept open and nuclear review brought
forward a year.
'Dash for gas' to continue with no restrictions on gas-fired power stations;
three projects get go-ahead
No restrictions on French sales of electricity to the UK.
New energy panel to offer advice on development of markets; government to
publish an annual energy review.
More money for research into clean coal technology.

FT  26 MAR 93 / World News in Brief: Loyalists murder five men as IRA bomb
victim dies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Terrorist violence continued unabated in Northern Ireland yesterday as the
IRA's Warrington bombing claimed another life. In Castlerock, north Antrim,
loyalist gunmen murdered four Roman Catholics arriving for work on a
building site. A fifth man was seriously injured. The outlawed Ulster
Freedom Fighters admitted the shootings and threatened to step up their
violence. Hours later, another Roman Catholic died after a shooting in a
west Belfast shop.
The killings came on the day 12-year-old Timothy Parry, who caught the full
force of the Warrington bomb blast last Saturday, died in Liverpool. In
their first joint statement on terrorism, Cardinals Basil Hume and Cahal
Daly, heads of the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales and Ireland,
condemned the Warrington bombing as 'barbaric'.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Yeltsin announces tough economic package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and DMITRI VOLKOV
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE REFORMIST Russian government of President Boris Yeltsin last night
unveiled a proposed package of stringent economic measures, before the
country's conservative-dominated parliament gathers today to debate Mr
Yeltsin's future.
The measures, including higher interest rates and a moratorium on foreign
debt repayments, would be enacted by presidential decree under powers
assumed by Mr Yeltsin on Wednesday.
Their announcement came after a cabinet meeting at the end of a day which
brought an abrupt about-turn by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary
speaker. Moves to impeach Mr Yeltsin for exceeding his authority appeared
unlikely after Mr Khasbulatov said he was no longer in favour of this
action.
'Frankly speaking, I'm no supporter of impeachment,' Mr Khasbulatov told
reporters. This follows his declaration on Tuesday that the case for
impeachment was 'as clear as day'.
But, a direct confrontation between the president and parliament is still
possible at today's Congress of People's Deputies.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy prime minister, said he expected the parliament
instead to invoke a constitutional clause which strips the president of his
powers if he tries to disband or suspend other elected institutions.
The deputies, said Mr Shakhrai, would be invited by Mr Khasbulatov to
resolve to bring this clause into play if Mr Yeltsin continued his
confrontation with them - and would clarify the clause by laying down that,
in that case, the office of president would pass to General Alexander
Rutskoi, currently vice-president.
Such a procedure might not require the two-thirds majority needed for
impeachment, and which the conservatives had been struggling to reach.
The impact on the congress today of the government's seizing of the economic
initiative could not immediately be gauged. The severity of the other
measures was tempered by a proposed 50 per cent increase in the minimum wage
for state employees to Rbs4,500 a month.
But the package was clearly too much even for some cabinet members. It was
tabled in the absence of prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, who was
absent from the meeting to meet the visiting Slovak leadership.
Chief among the dissenters was Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the chairman of the
central bank and ex-cabinet member. Earlier yesterday he received a letter
from Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister for the economy and finance,
warning him he intended to seek Mr Gerashchenko's dismissal for failing to
act in accordance with government policy. Mr Gerashchenko said he would
return any future such messages without reading them.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Heseltine wins over Tory backbenchers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CONSERVATIVE MPs yesterday gave Mr Michael Heseltine a spirited
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
but not quite rousing - backing for his coal pit proposals that appeared to
have headed off the threat of a full-blown revolt that would end his
political career.
Labour protested that the trade and industry secretary's package was 'only a
stay of execution'. But the number of Conservative MPs prepared to vote
against the government has all but evaporated. Only a handful are expected
to abstain when MPs vote on the package on Monday.
Colleagues of Mr Heseltine believe that a government defeat would force his
resignation. Conservative business managers were confident last night,
however, that his position, in the short term at least, is safe.
Mr Heseltine's typically flamboyant two-hour Commons performance combined
fierce attacks on Labour MPs with deliberate flattery of Tory colleagues.
He wooed members of the Commons select committee on trade and industry by
saying he 'broadly accepts the thrust of their central recommendations' - a
claim challenged by some of the committee's members.
Mr Heseltine's political career has been battered by the coal debacle and
his reception on Conservative benches yesterday fell short of adulation. He
began a concerted effort to build support for his proposals last night by
meeting the Tory backbench trade and industry committee - where in October
he was given a bruising reception.
Sir Michael Grylls, the committee's chairman, said: 'He was greeted like a
knight in shining armour who makes a rescue bid.' The government will be
anxious to avert the growth of any disquiet over the weekend.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said the white paper
amounted to 'a comprehensive admission of failure'. Mr Heseltine had 'failed
to find a market for one single extra tonne of coal'.
He added: 'The period of two years has nothing to do with the time to turn
round these pits, and everything to do with your timetable to privatise the
coal industry and wash your hands of it.'
Support among the broad swathe of Conservative MPs was tempered by some
protests at the bringing forward of the coal debate to Monday - a decision
apparently calculated to minimise the scope for any disquiet to ferment at
Westminster.
Yet many, particularly on the party's right wing, were relieved that
subsidies had been limited and the jobs saved were not at the expense of
jobs in the gas or oil industries.
The most vociferous attack by a Tory came from Mr Richard Alexander, MP for
Newark, who complained the package would cause 'devastation' in north
Nottinghamshire and that Mr Heseltine had failed in his promise to keep
Union of Democratic Mineworkers' pits open.
But others who protested last October were falling into line last night. Mr
Winston Churchill, Tory MP for Davyhulme, welcomed the 'very considerable
distance he has travelled since October 13'.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Dividend payments speeded up to beat Budget tax changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF Britain's largest companies yesterday speeded up their dividend
payments to save shareholders money at the expense of the taxman.
The rush was intended to pre-empt a change in the advance corporation tax
rate, which was announced in last week's Budget and is due to come into
effect on April 6. The change reduces the level of tax credits available to
shareholders.
PowerGen, the UK's second largest electricity generator, and retailer Boots
brought forward the announcement of their end of year dividends by two
months.
Reed, the publisher, and Reuters Holdings, the business information and news
group, said they would pay a second interim dividend on April 5 in place of
previously announced final dividends which require shareholder approval at
annual meetings.
Several smaller companies, including Capital Radio and engineering company
Laird made similar announcements with more to follow in the next week.
PowerGen said a second interim dividend of 7.15p would be paid to
shareholders on March 31. The company was due to pay its final dividend in
October.
Mr John Rennocks, executive director for finance, said about half of
PowerGen's shareholders would benefit: 'The change delivers about Pounds
4.6m to shareholders which would not have been recoverable from the
Treasury.'
Under the Budget changes, shareholders who do not pay tax, for example
pension funds, and higher rate taxpayers stand to lose out because of a
reduction in tax credit. The rate of 25 per cent is being reduced to 20 per
cent over two years for companies and from April 6 for shareholders.
Yesterday's announcements alone cost the Inland Revenue nearly Pounds 20m.
Boots and Reuters estimated they saved shareholders about Pounds 6m and
Pounds 5.5m respectively, while Reed said its investors would be Pounds 3.4m
better off.
Mr Terry Steel, Boots' director of investor relations, said paying the
dividend early would cost the company about Pounds 1m to Pounds 2m.
Companies which have not yet planned moving their dividend forward may have
difficulty meeting the deadline. The move needs prior arrangement with
registrars and the Stock Exchange, and companies must have adequate cash on
hand.
Separately, RTZ Corporation, the mining company, said it planned to offer a
scrip dividend 50 per cent higher than its recently announced final cash
dividend of 13.5p. The shares offer, which follows a similar scheme from BAT
Industries, is designed to reduce unrelieved ACT on high overseas earnings.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Observer: Empty seats at pit head
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Finding a few bodies to fill the vacant seats on the board of the British
Coal Corporation is hardly the most pressing item on Michael Heseltine's
agenda. However, it has taken on a sense of urgency following the
publication of the Prospects for Coal white paper.
The terms of Bert Wheeler, the deputy chairman, and Kevan Hunt, the employee
relations director, expire next week and the government hasn't yet replaced
Malcolm Edwards, the commercial director who was ousted last year, or Ken
Moses, the strategic planning director who died. If it doesn't act soon, the
only two British Coal executives left on the corporation board will be Neil
Clarke, the chairman, and Michael Butler, the finance director.
It is not as if there is any shortage of talent on the executive committee
which runs the day-to-day business. Andrew Horsler, in charge of marketing,
could easily step into Edwards' old seat and Ray Proctor, who heads British
Coal's privatisation team, would fit in with Hezza's commitment to appoint a
board member with special executive responsibility for privatisation.
It is understood that Neil Clarke has already indicated his willingness to
put Proctor up for board membership. It is far from clear whether the delay
in making the appointment comes from the government side or from Proctor
himself - conscious that his job security may be a little less assured if he
were no longer a humble employee.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Tasks for the mobile manager
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IBM IS apparently about to choose a consumer products boss as its new chief
executive. Barclays is looking worldwide for a 'change agent' who could come
from outside banking. Ilva, Italy's state-owned steelmaker, hopes for rescue
from a newly recruited Japanese manager. Volkswagen, in hiring GM's
procurement supremo, has also taken his sidekicks.
With 'back to basics' and 'sticking to your knitting' the business cliches
of the hour, you might think the mobile manager would be out of favour.
Instead, top executives skip from group to group like soccer managers; and
shareholders call for fresh management 'from outside' whenever problems
appear intractable.
Two factors contribute to this trend. First is the one Sir Denys Henderson,
who is heading the search for Barclays' new boss, alluded to when he talked
of the need for a 'change agent'. The 1960s belief in generalised management
skills has dropped out of favour - to be replaced with a belief in a
generalised talent for instigating change.
Thus Mr Louis Gerstner, favourite for the job at IBM, is in demand because
he has brought about change at American Express and RJR Nabisco. Now he can
apply those skills to changing what was once America's mightiest
corporation.
The second factor, though less overt, is surely more potent. This is a
general crisis of the corporation, the organisational structure created by
such companies as the Pennsylvania Railroad and Du Pont a century ago.
Obsolete model
Global competition, the revolutionary impact of information technology, the
ever-vaguer boundaries between a company and its suppliers and customers -
together these are making the traditional corporate model obsolete. When new
managers are sought, the underlying belief is that they will resolve the
crisis - or perhaps merely make it go away.
In such circumstances, an incoming executive's success depends only in part
on those characteristics of will-power and moral certainty that headhunters
call 'leadership qualities'. More decisive, in the long run, is the nature
of the business, the seriousness of its day-to-day problems, and the extent
to which the board really wishes to address the questions posed by the
crisis of the corporation.
The most celebrated change manager of recent US experience, Mr Jack Welch of
GE, started to address his company's hidden structural crisis before it
began to be reflected in operating results. He had the time, therefore, to
think and persuade.
A manager brought in from outside to rescue a sick company has no such
luxury. At the same time as trying to bring about long-term, far-reaching
change, the new boss must also cope with each day's fresh diet of crisis and
despair. The task is made the harder if the new leader must also learn an
industry, a culture, a language from scratch.
Valuable insights
Yet an outside manager has one enormous advantage over even the most
competent insider. The most difficult aspect of the crisis of the
corporation is the need for companies to redraw their boundaries - to cope
with changing global competition by taking a fresh look at what they make,
as opposed to what they buy, and how they relate to suppliers and customers.
On this issue, above all, an outside manager can offer insights that
insiders miss.
Significantly, most of the big companies currently looking far afield for
management talent have this sort of problem. IBM must decide just which of
its huge range of computer activities are its core business; VW must shift
from internal to outside sourcing of components; and once its immediate bad
debt problems are past, Barclays must resolve the tension between a domestic
retail financial services operation and an internationally minded wholesale
banking and securities business.
Perhaps there is, after all, no contradiction between the back-to-basics
mood and the desire to find top managers from outside. Companies must decide
just what their knitting is, before setting about the task of sticking to
it. For those who find that difficult, an outside manager who can help is
worth all the fees and bad publicity that a public search entails.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Heseltine at the coal face
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS taken Mr Michael Heseltine, Britain's trade and industry secretary,
five months to clear his throat and try once more to explain what he thinks
to be the appropriate future for the country's coal industry.
On October 13 last year, he announced that demand for British Coal's output
was falling so fast that he could see no alternative to the company's plan
to close 31 of its 50 pits. With the recession at its bleakest, the public
edgy and the Tory backbenches in a flush of post-election enthusiasm for
lording it over a government with a slim majority, the proposals hit an
unscaleable wall of resistance.
Yesterday, Mr Heseltine looked muscular enough to scale that wall. He now
thinks that 12 of the 31 doomed pits can be saved. But at what cost has this
has been achieved, financially and in terms of additional muddle for
Britain's energy industries?
The 150-page document Mr Heseltine produced yesterday to support his case at
least has the merit of stating soundly, if inelegantly, the principles upon
which energy policy should be based. It says: 'Competitive markets provide
the best means of ensuring that the nation has access to secure, diverse and
sustainable supplies of energy in the forms that people and businesses want,
and at competitive prices.'
It is also obvious that Mr Heseltine has not changed his view that the coal
industry faces decline, at the hands of cleaner, cheaper gas and continued
supplies of cheap electricity from nuclear power stations where construction
costs have been written off and where decommissioning costs are there to be
paid whether they are shut down or kept going.
Resisting pressure
The government has resisted most of the most foolish things urged by its
critics. It will not delay the liberalisation of the electricity supply
market; it will not switch off supplies of French electricity; it will not
interfere with freely agreed contracts based on gas-fired power stations. It
will not instruct the big electricity generators, National Power and
PowerGen, to buy more coal than they think fit. Or at least, it will not do
so openly.
At the same time, it has made concessions to the influential Commons Trade
and Industry Committee which are at worst harmless. There will, for example,
be an annual energy report and a panel of energy advisers, perhaps along the
lines of the Treasury's panel of forecasters. Both these innovations could
improve the quality of public debate and force the government to set its
market-led energy policies in a strategic context and so avoid conceding by
default the argument that it lacks an energy policy.
Unclear picture
So far, not so bad. The problem is that for all its welter of detail, the
report fails to give anything like a precise picture of the cost of the
subsidies it proposes to make British coal more saleable. Since the report
also suggests the government may lean on the power generators to carry more
stocks than they need, there is a further potential line of subsidy under
the table.
Worryingly, no clear time limit is set on these subventions, raising the
possibility that a weak government will in practice back off from difficult
decisions, requiring the taxpayer to pick up any bill British Coal happens
to run up. In other words, it could be business as usual for the British
coal industry.
This need not be the outcome. If the government does as it promises and
presses on quickly with a privatisation bill, while lifting British Coal's
effective monopoly on the licensing of mines and putting all redundant pits
up for sale, the coal industry could be quite swiftly transferred to the
private sector. There, it is much more likely to achieve the productivity
advances which consultants have argued to be feasible. Since the subsidies
proposed yesterday will also be available to private sector coal companies,
they could be used as fixed-term sweeteners for privatisation deals.
Mr Heseltine has the makings of the right policy, but it will take more
months of political skill and determination to achieve it. His next steps
should be to come clean about its cost and get on with the job of
privatisation.

FT  26 MAR 93 / In sickness and in health: Recession has put Brussels'
hands-off approach to EC industry to the test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European industry is in the grip of recession and wants government to do
something about it. There are cries for help from makers of Spanish steel,
Dutch trucks and Portuguese textiles. The EC's formal answer is clear: the
old days of helping lame ducks and picking winners have passed. The best
future for Europe's manufacturing lies in competition and the single market.
But that policy was agreed in the prosperous late 1980s. Now that times are
tough again, can Brussels hold the line?
'The next few months,' says a senior EC official, 'are decisive for the
credibility of our policy.' The official line is enshrined in a document
produced by the European Commission in 1990. The document has all the
hallmarks of close co-operation between the EC industry commissioner, Mr
Martin Bangemann, and Sir Leon Brittan, then competition commissioner and a
staunch opponent of interventionist industrial policy.
It backed a 'hands-off' approach, based on firm rules and the creation of a
stable environment for Community industry. Companies themselves would have
to do most of the work to remain globally competitive. The Community would
do its best to provide, in the jargon of the paper, the 'prerequisites,
catalysts and accelerators' for growth.
'The aim is to make European industry effective,' says Mr Bangemann. 'To be
there if there's a problem and to help industry to overcome the problem.'
The argument is expanded by Mr Riccardo Perissich, director general for
industry at the Commission. 'The only conviction I have is that there should
be a large manufacturing base in Europe. That still is the main source of
prosperity in our society. The fashionable ideas of the 1980s that we are
going towards a post-industrial society are rubbish.
'But from that point onwards, I've never believed in sunset industries and
advanced industries - things we should have and shouldn't have,' he says.
'It could be madness to invest too much in computer chips where one cannot
be competitive. Textiles can be a fantastic industrial base, provided they
are competitive. In the world we're living in, sectoral priorities are very
dangerous.'
But senior Commission officials concede that times are now harder. 'When the
sun shines and we all feel warm, it's easy to renounce the policy of
preferring one sector against another,' says one.
Mr Perissich adds: 'The pressure to be defensive is increasing, there's no
doubt about that. The 1990 document was written at a time when European
economies were converging and there was good growth, and now we have
neither.'
In addition, threats by the new US administration to act tough in existing
trade disputes - public procurement, steel and civil aircraft  - and
suggestions that President Clinton may intervene to assist important
strategic US industries are tempting EC member states, if not the Commission
itself, to respond with a European brand of protectionism and
interventionism.
A separate danger is pointed out by Mr Karel Van Miert, who succeeded Sir
Leon Brittan as competition commissioner in January. In the 1980s, he says,
national industrial interests were increasingly subsumed in EC-wide policy.
'The tendency now, with the depressed economic situation and public opinion,
is in the opposite direction. That means that more and more, regions or
member states will themselves be under pressure. Enterprises are going
broke, and state aids are being given in cases where it doesn't make any
sense.'
At the moment, Mr Bangemann and Mr Van Miert are preoccupied with the plight
of the EC steel industry - hit by recession, cheap imports from non-EC
countries and overcapacity. If an EC-wide plan to support the industry is to
succeed, they must dissuade countries such as Spain, Italy and Germany from
unilaterally subsidising Europe's least efficient steel producers without
regard to the effect on the rest of the EC industry. Mr Van Miert has warned
of a damaging 'state aids race' in the steel industry, which could be
mimicked in other politically sensitive sectors such as cars and
electronics.
However, as another Brussels official says, there is a simple pressure the
other way. 'The money isn't there,' he says. '(Funding for) industrial
policy is being crowded out by the cost of servicing debt.'
But if the picture looks like one of straightforward competition uncluttered
by subsidy, it becomes less clear on inspection. As another senior official
says: 'In Brussels you find little ideology, but you find a lot of
interests.'
Commissioner Van Miert says: 'If it were all left to competition inside and
outside the Community, what would be left of agricultural policy? What would
be left of shipbuilding? Nothing. What would be left of steel? Not very
much. Of textiles? Not very much.'
From a free market viewpoint, the obvious question is whether that matters.
'Of course it does,' the commissioner says brusquely. 'Do you really believe
our competitors take that kind of view? Do the Japanese? Do the Americans?
You should not be naive about it. I very much believe in competition, but
not as a religion. You must observe a proper balance.'
This raises a separate question. In Japan and increasingly in the US, it is
taken for granted that certain strategic industries - the so-called
technologies of the future - should receive special treatment. In the widest
sense, this constitutes picking winners. Where does the Commission stand?
Mr Perissich is carefully ambiguous. Take, for instance, electronics and
telecommunications. 'It's difficult to have a very clear strategy of what
Europe should do there. On the one hand, it would be madness for us to
concentrate the enormous resources it would take to make sure that European
industry becomes a player at the same level as the big American and Japanese
competitors. It could be done, but the cost-effectiveness of the operation
would be impossible to prove. At the same time, I am also open to the
argument that in some elements of these technologies, there is a danger of
dominance by oligopolies based elsewhere. They can then play a number of
games - technological protection, predatory pricing - which distort the
situation.'
The same ambiguity informs his view of possible lame ducks. The European car
industry, he says, has every chance of survival. But what if it did not? 'In
political and social terms it's an enormously important industry.
Psychologically too. If you told public opinion tomorrow that the car
industry was going to disappear, they would look on that as a tremendous
loss.'
But, he adds: 'We gradually have to bring people to accept that if they
stick to the narrow concept that there must be an Italian or a French or a
German or a British car industry, then they are doomed. But that can only
happen if we are both pragmatic and cautious.'
All the same, it is hard to find a voice raised in Brussels these days in
favour of old-style dirigisme. There seems to be universal commitment to the
principle of the internal market, which officially opened for business on
January 1 and is described by one official as 'the largest industrial policy
move we've made for years'. There has been no attempt by member states to
restore internal barriers to goods, services and capital, despite the fact
that the pressures resulting from the single market have worsened the
effects of recession.
The shortage of cash is also a reality. According to Commission figures,
subsidies to manufacturing in the Community have been gradually declining
since 1986. Aid by individual states totalled Ecu36bn (Pounds 29bn) between
1988 and 1990, 9 per cent down on the preceding two years. 'Not only do we
have more rules, not only do we operate those rules more transparently,
there's also less money available,' says a senior competition official.
That observation applies to both national and central policies. EC leaders
agreed at the Edinburgh summit that the overall EC budget would rise to
Ecu84.1bn by 1999, in 1992 prices. Of the total, the EC's common
agricultural policy - the archetype of a flawed sectoral strategy - will
receive Ecu38.4bn in 1999. Structural funds, spent on the poorest parts of
the Community, will reach Ecu30bn. By contrast, the budget for 'internal
actions' - including the funds earmarked for industry through R&amp;D, transport
and infrastructure spending - will rise from Ecu3.94bn in 1993 to only
Ecu5.1bn in 1999.
Mr Bangemann, who has held the industry portfolio since 1989, claims a lack
of funding has never hamstrung his strategy: 'My policy isn't based on
money, it's based on policy,' he says.
The December reshuffle of Commission portfolios gave him control over
telecommunications and a substantial part of the Community's R&amp;D funding. In
principle, Mr Bangemann wants telecommunications - including information
technology - to spearhead EC industry policy in the next two years. The
practical reality, however, is that his policy is only one of many competing
for a dwindling pot of cash.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Le doomsday machine: John Plender says France's commitment
to the franc fort policy threatens financial stability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the leaders of the main parties in the French elections uniformly
committed to the same brand of hair-shirt economics, the only worthwhile
political debate has been taking place in the markets. The question remains:
is the franc fort policy, to which the incoming government will be as
committed as the old, sustainable? It matters not only for the growing army
of the unemployed in France, but for the future of Europe.
The starting point of the debate is the conjunction of French short-term
interest rates of about 11 per cent with inflation heading for 2 per cent or
less. The French economy is thus living with real (inflation-adjusted)
short-term rates of interest of nearly 9 per cent. That is only a minor
irritant for many private individuals, since home loans are largely at fixed
long-term rates. The banks' prime lending rates, which apply to 90 per cent
of consumer borrowing, have been kept artificially low at 10 per cent to
mitigate the pain for others.
But for the corporate sector it is another matter. There, as a recent paper
from Midland Global Markets Research points out, only 30 per cent of total
debt is long term. The squeeze is most severe for small businesses, which
are dependent on the banks for funds. They, too, are helped by the banks
holding base rates at artificially low levels. But not enough, as Midland
says, to prevent soaring bankruptcies.
The real crunch, however, is in property, where the fall in the Paris market
is becoming serious. The banks could probably live for some time with base
rates below their marginal cost of funds, particularly where they have
access to cheap retail deposits. But as Robin Monro-Davies of the rating
agency IBCA argues, they cannot survive a remorseless deterioration in the
quality of their assets. The scale of the problem is, so far, smaller than
in Britain or the US. But for want of lower interest rates, the French are
manufacturing a comparable crisis.
A government committed to the European exchange rate mechanism is
necessarily condemned to this seemingly perverse course of action. Instead
of bolstering bank profits by reducing short rates, as the US Federal
Reserve has successfully done in comparable circumstances, the authorities
are maintaining an inverse yield curve - that is, keeping short rates above
long rates. The result is a doomsday machine which, if allowed to continue,
would eventually destroy the solvency of the banking system, wreck the
public finances and impose a savage credit crunch on the economy.
No one has told the Paris Bourse, which has been looking forward to bank
privatisation. While the rating agencies have downgraded the debt of big
French banks, share prices of Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais,
Paribas and Suez have risen by about 20 per cent since the new year, far
outperforming the market. This looks like cloud-cuckoo land.
In effect, the government is betting the whole banking system on a sudden
dash for Franco-German monetary union, or on the Bundesbank reducing
interest rates far and fast. The promise of early monetary union, combined
with an open commitment to defend a fixed parity at any cost, would help by
reducing the risk premium in French interest rates - the extra return to
compensate for not being in the more stable D-Mark.
But will the Bundesbank be bludgeoned into accepting a deal that puts it out
of business and kills the D-Mark? And will Bonn be so keen on monetary union
with a new French government whose trade policy it finds repellent?
If, implausibly, the answer to both questions is yes, the banking problem
would be more manageable. But interest rate convergence with Frankfurt would
still leave the French with real short rates of more than 6 per cent -
swingeing in a recession. And the markets might anyway demand higher rates
for the unified currency to compensate for the loss of exclusive German
monetary management.
As for the Bundesbank, further interest rate cuts are inevitable since the
German economy is groggy. Yet the recently agreed solidarity pact looked a
conspicuous fudge, with little attempt to prune the public sector until
mid-decade. With its own survival at stake, the Bundesbank has less
incentive to hurry the cuts; and in view of the continuing laxity of fiscal
policy, it is hard to see its council readily conceding any level of
interest rates over the next 12 months that would take France off the hook.
Meantime, further French victories in yesterday's battle against inflation
will simply add to the pain.
This suggests that if the new French government sticks with the franc fort,
and fails to win early monetary union, the sustainability of policy will
remain an issue for far longer than assumed. The battle with the markets is
far from over.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Letter: Greater transparency likely in French privatisation
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALFRED LATHAM-KOENIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to offer a few comments on William Dawkins' excellent
article on French privatisation ('Assault on the state frontiers', March
16).
The commission on privatisation - which he doesn't mention - will play a far
more important role than in 1986 and operate with greater transparency and
full independence. It will not only fix minimum prices for companies to be
privatised but also select the 'noyaux durs' so that the government cannot
be accused, as in 1986, of unduly favouring its supporters.
The privatisation programme will most probably be in two stages: in the
first two years ending with the presidential elections of 1995 the most
likely candidates are Rhone-Poulenc, Elf-Aquitaine, AGF (Assurances
Generales de France), Renault, in that order, and it is doubtful whether the
first privatisation could be effected before October 1993.
In the second, post-1995 stage, depending on the result of the presidential
elections, the success of the first tranche and the buoyancy of the stock
market, it is probable that the government will gradually open up the
capital of some public monopolies such as France Telecom or EDF to private
capital while maintaining a controlling interest.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Letter: Real returns required on railway projects a bar to
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN GREGORY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his letter (March 11), David Howell comments on the 'imperative need
to raise levels of investment in the infrastructure of the country', and
notes the need to take a long-term view of such investment. The government's
approach to the problem of railway capital projects is to promote
legislation which is highly unlikely to stimulate new investment, while
requiring all new publicly financed projects to earn 8 per cent in real
terms.
One can plausibly argue that this rate of return is far too high, bearing in
mind the current costs of capital implied by the level of the stock market
and the risks of rail investment. The dividend yield on the FT-All Share
Index is just above 4 per cent; if one assumes a real long-term dividend
growth rate of 2.5 per cent a year and applies the standard dividend growth
model, the result is that the implicit future real return on the market is
about 6.7 per cent. Given a real yield on long index-linked gilts of
approximately 3.5 per cent, the current risk premium on equities is about
3.2 per cent.
In the sense of economic risk (the type measured by beta), rail investment
seems likely to be of less than average risk, possibly compatible with that
of other UK utilities. These have betas which average between 0.7 and 0.8
per cent, suggesting a risk premium of 2.2 to 2.5 per cent. However, these
betas reflect equity costs of capital, and private-sector utilities benefit
from the tax advantage of debt finance. Depending on the gearing assumptions
one wishes to make, it seems reasonable to assume that a fairer required
return on new rail investment is around the order of 4 to 5 per cent.
Furthermore, any social benefits of railway investment should be included in
the investment analysis.
The current policy on rail investment could have far-reaching consequences
for future economic development and the environment. Fortunately, the remedy
is a simple amendment of the investment appraisal rules. The budget offered
the chancellor the ideal opportunity to make such an amendment. He missed
it.

<TEXT>
That creaking sound in Downing Street is of a prime minister's equilibrium
being restored. On Wednesday night the government won a procedural vote on
the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Whew] Yesterday it presented a
white paper on coal that stands a chance of being accepted by the House of
Commons. Crikey] These two happy portents follow a Budget whose public
reception has pleased the chancellor of the exchequer, if not absolutely
everyone else. Sighs of relief all round.
There is no cause to get overexcited. Mr John Major may conclude that the
Conservatives' prolonged winter of disasters is coming to an end, but that
does not change the quality of his cabinet. Britain still has to live with
the best that a less-than-scintillating administration is capable of
delivering. That means we must endure a continuation of government in bits
and bobs. Some bits may be beneficial. Many will do very little harm. Few
are likely to be connected to one another. There is no theme to this
government, and little in the way of consistency. As one of the prime
minister's loyal backbenchers put it the other day: 'The sixth form has
taken over the school, and the smarter among them are beginning to get the
hang of things.' Or as certain City lunch-tables have it: 'We'll never have
a decent government until Clarke is prime minister and Portillo is
chancellor.'
It is not many years since gossip put the name 'Heseltine' where Clarke
presently stands. Mr Michael Heseltine, who published the revised plan for
coal yesterday, is one of a small number of grown-up politicians around Mr
Major. He is one of the few men of substance in a cabinet of phantoms. Until
recently his politics always aroused some kind of passion: he was either
strongly admired or deeply mistrusted. This now toothless lion of British
politics celebrated his 60th birthday last Sunday. The festivities were
marred by several hours he was obliged to spend on coal, the subject that
since October has threatened to blight the evening of his career.
The party over, he slogged through a week in which he could hardly avoid
looking and sounding harassed. He took to musing, as might be expected on
such an anniversary, about his life's work. He has not done badly: built up
a publishing empire; made a fortune; planted an arboretum; toppled a prime
minister; risen to become secretary for trade and industry. The latter is
the cabinet post, top dog's apart, that he always says he holds in highest
regard; what a pity he has chosen to call himself president of the Board of
Trade. It would be piquant, he acknowledges, if he, the instrument of Lady
Thatcher's downfall, were to be destroyed by the coal mess, itself a
consequence of the mishandling of energy policy by the then Mrs Thatcher's
government.
Such a drama would properly be entitled The Lady's Revenge. It could yet
reach our political theatre, although it is unlikely. The 'president' will
have had little difficulty in persuading his colleagues that he will resign
on Monday if at the end of the debate on his white paper the House rejects
it. As he is not slow to point out, he is a man of honour. He has resigned
once before. Against that, he retains sufficient political skill to know how
to re-package an old pit-closure policy and scent it with flattery of his
Conservative opponents.
He is still well able to turn on the enemy when fire is aimed at his person
from all sides. For years a British sport has been to watch him get out of
political traps by attacking the Labour party. That is what he did
yesterday. It was hugely enjoyable. As insurance, he wrapped his
presentation in a few hundred million used pound notes dunned from the
taxpayers. A 'few?'. Precision was not on offer. The 'president's' white
paper should, however, achieve two objectives. It should ensure the survival
of Mr Heseltine, at least for long enough for him to be able to say, as he
ascends to the House of Lords, that he has had a good innings. To do that,
it must turn out to be enough to bamboozle most of the small band of Tory
backbench opponents of pit closures into the self-delusion that something
lasting has been achieved.
The truth, however, is that the run-down of coal mining will continue,
albeit at a slightly slower pace. The laws of economics are dictating the
terms, and would have done so if there had been no botched Thatcherite
energy policy, no Heseltine humiliation when the closures were announced
last October, no select committee report, and no white paper yesterday. The
mines employed 1.25m men in 1920, the peak year. At the time of
nationalisation in 1947 this figure was down to 700,000, doubtless including
some women. Last October it stood at 54,000. The 31 pit closures then
announced would have taken it to 24,000 by now.
The employer, British Coal, is nearly half-way there. Some 8,000 miners have
accepted redundancy since October. A further 5,800 near-term job losses were
announced yesterday. Mr Heseltine's lengthy white paper, like the
chancellor's budget, throws in everything his civil servants could think of,
and a few extras besides. British Coal will be privatised. While awaiting
that glorious day, it will offer pits it does not want to private buyers,
within the constraints of the current law. The remainder will be
'mothballed' or subsidised for a period while the market asserts itself. In
short, that 24,000 figure may be delayed by a year or two, but it is coming
in spite of everything.
If the trick works it will be an achievement of sorts. The government fell
on its face last year because it allowed Mr Heseltine, who should have known
better, to announce the instant closure of 31 pits. That was at a time when
nobody had much respect for any minister following Britain's ejection from
the European exchange rate mechanism. At the same time, most people were
deeply worried about unemployment for themselves or their families.
The worst outcome of the subsequent negotiations would have been a total
panic and an open-ended commitment to subsidise an ever-increasing mountain
of unsold coal. By playing the game long, and by talking down expectations
in advance, the government has won itself a chance of buying its survival
relatively cheaply while yet running down an industry that, on environmental
grounds, should be written off by the turn of the century.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Letter: Subsidiarity the prime reason for voluntary ecology
audits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From F R VAN DER MENSBRUGGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to your article, 'Voluntary ecological audit scheme
approved by EC' (March 24), it is subsidiarity which is the primary reason
behind the European Community having agreed on voluntary ecological audits,
rather than mandatory ones.
Already present within the Treaty of Rome via Article 130r (4) (added to the
treaty by Article 25 of the Single European Act and a rare application of
subsidiarity in a legally binding instrument), the principle of subsidiarity
implies a withdrawal of authority. When the Commission first drafted its
1990 proposals calling for mandatory eco-audits, it was under the impetus of
the then environment commissioner, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, chided at the
time by Jacques Delors for failing to respect subsidiarity. The Commission's
president may thus be considered responsible for the agreement on voluntary
eco-audits.
As obscure as it may seem in practical terms, Mr John Major and Mr Douglas
Hurd rightly understand and support the principle of subsidiarity. Indeed,
British ratification of the Maastricht treaty, built on its letter and
spirit, serves the interests of Britain.

Sir, Your correspondents, M H Upson and Mark Scheinbaum (Letters, March 24)
are missing the point. A 39-year-old highly skilled applicant is most
unlikely to be significantly less suitable than an equally experienced one
of 49, for any job. However, if the employer operates a 'final' pay pension
scheme - and most substantial companies in the UK do - the older individual
will be far more expensive in prospective pensions liability for, say, 15
years' service to come. No amount of legislation concerning age limits in
advertisements will alter the actuarial facts, and any system which
inevitably imposes costs on employers that climb with age and time,
irrespective of workers' productivity, is a sure catalyst for the
destruction of older people's careers.

<TEXT>
FOUNDATIONS OF CORPORATE SUCCESS: HOW BUSINESS STRATEGIES ADD VALUE
By John Kay
Oxford University Press
Pounds 19.95. 416 pages
For more than 30 years, students of corporate strategy have sought to
understand and categorise the essential conditions which determine business
success. But in that time, what of practical value have they actually
discovered?
Not much, according to John Kay. At worst, he argues, corporate strategy is
akin to quack medicine. Highly susceptible to fad and fashion, it owes its
continuing appeal more to the plausibility of practitioners and the
desperate search by managers for solutions than to any evidence that it
delivers beneficial results.
As professor of economics at London Business School and former head of its
Centre for Business Strategy, Kay is well-qualified to play iconoclast.
However, the main purpose of this book is not to demolish corporate
strategy, but to legitimise it as a discipline by re-defining its role and
equipping it with more precise analytical tools.
The obvious first question is how to judge success. Kay rejects yardsticks
such as scale, market share or return on capital. He plumps instead for
added value, the margin by which the value of a company's output exceeds the
costs of the raw materials, capital and labour it employs.
On this measure Glaxo, Benetton, Reuters, Petrofina, Kwik Save, LVMH and
Guinness rank among the stars of European industry, with which Kay is
primarily concerned. By contrast, Philips, the ailing Dutch electronics
group, has had negative added value in recent years: in other words, it has
been destroying wealth, a process which, in the absence of subsidy, cannot
go on.
In analysing these companies' performance, most approaches to corporate
strategy would seek to extract from their management methods and
organisation general lessons which could be profitably applied by other
businesses. But that, according to Kay, is where conventional practitioners
have come badly unstuck.
Not only, he says, do their prescriptions often amount to arid checklists
and platitudes, of negligible practical value. Their whole approach is based
on a logical nonsense. For every company's competitive advantage is, by
definition, unique to it and cannot be replicated or adapted by others. If
it could be, it would soon be nullified.
Failure to grasp this lesson has trapped many businesses in futile
'wish-driven' strategies. In the case of Bull, the embattled French computer
maker which has long struggled to become Europe's answer to IBM, the vision
was unachievable. In the case of the Saatchis' ruinously expensive efforts
to build a global marketing services company, it was not worth achieving.
Kay argues that, instead of being beguiled by the vision thing, the proper
function of corporate strategy is to start with the question: 'How can we be
different?'
The answers are to be found by identifying within each company its most
valuable sources of actual or potential advantage. These distinctive
capabilities, as he calls them, fall into four broad categories and can
occur singly or - preferably - in combination.
One is innovation, a fragile advantage because it is easily replicable by
competitors. Another, more defensible, capability is reputation, typically
in the form of strong brands. A third is strategic assets, such as a
government-sanctioned monopoly or airlines' landing slots. These inhibit
market entry by rivals, though their owners do not necessarily create added
value.
The fourth capability - and in Kay's view the most critical - is what he
terms architecture: the links between a company and its employees, customers
and suppliers. More far-reaching than corporate culture, architecture is the
fountainhead of institutional knowledge and adaptability.
At the heart of strong architecture is a network of stable relational
contracts, or implicit understandings between participants which govern
their behaviour towards each other. In a novel application of the rules of
game theory, the author finds that such contracts are most likely to
flourish when a game is played repeatedly over a long period. This is
because players' knowledge that they must go on dealing with each other
discourages selfish opportunism and favours a mutually beneficial outcome.
This is an important feature of successful businesses such as Marks &amp;
Spencer and many Japanese and German companies, which have consistently
managed to unite a range of interests behind a common purpose. As Kay puts
it: 'Architecture does not create extraordinary organisations by assembling
extraordinary people . . . but by enabling very ordinary people to perform
in extraordinary ways.'
Conversely, many of the deficiencies of US and UK corporate practice
identified by critics of 'short-termism' stem from a business environment
which prizes one-off transactional relationships and pursuit of individual
gain above continuity and stability. One of its biggest weaknesses is that
the appropriation of wealth can too easily take priority over its creation,
as exemplified by the US buy-out boom of the late 1980s.
Other students of corporate performance have identified some of these
connections before. But none has explored them as thoroughly as Kay, who
succeeds in marrying an authoritative grasp of economic, legal and
sociological theory with an impressively detailed knowledge of contemporary
business practice.
A further strength of his approach is that it does not assume that
outstanding corporate success is immutable - a common mistake of management
books, notably In Search of Excellence, Waterman and Peters' best-seller of
the early 1980s. Indeed, Kay's analysis of Benetton concludes that the
company has exhausted much of the potential of its distinctive capabilities
and is condemned to much slower growth in future.
Foundations of Corporate Success is not without faults. Kay's claim to put
strategy in a distinctly European perspective does not really stand up. Not
only does he appear most at home when dealing with the British corporate
scene, but the sheer diversity of national business practices in Europe
militates against generalisations. Furthermore, some chapters, such as those
devoted to cost accounting and acquisitions and mergers, have little new to
add.
But these are minor criticisms of a powerfully argued book, which casts a
fresh light on a range of practical business challenges. It should also
engender a healthy scepticism towards the currently fashionable school of
theory which holds that strategy is all about aspiring to realise towering
management visions.
As Kay puts it: 'If there is a single central fallacy in much modern
strategic thinking, it is the notion that the act of will is the most
important element in corporate achievement.'

FT  26 MAR 93 / Letter: Talisman no successor to Taurus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G H SEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your review of the Taurus project ('Sudden death of a runaway bull',
March 19) contained a clear warning for those hoping to build a long-term
solution for the London equity market's settlement requirements on the base
of the Talisman system. A key quotation pointed out that Talisman was a
14-year-old system where much of the software is unique or obsolete and will
not tolerate interference. However successful Talisman has been, it will be
very difficult to extend its functions and its performance even to support a
limited system providing facilities for the largest institutions. Any
attempt to develop it to a level where it could support rolling settlement
and delivery versus payment would almost certainly end in a similar disaster
to the Taurus project.
Eventually, a modern system will have to be installed, whether it is written
as bespoke software or developed from a system in use elsewhere. To be
successful, the project must be strongly controlled with a clear and
consistent goal towards which the business analysts and technicians can aim.
Further, the best technical expertise must be obtained, so input from other
areas with greater experience of large, high-performance databases (for
example, the airline industry) must be sought. It would seem likely that
only the Bank of England would have the authority to overcome vested
interests within the City and bring such a project to a successful
conclusion. Past history in terms of the gilts and money market settlement
systems provides hope that the Bank can and will exert such authority. G H

Is it really sheer chance that tonight's Arena on BBC2 happens to clash with
Heartburn on BBC1? Arena sets out to challenge the pretence that 'any
resemblance between the characters portrayed in this book and any person
living or dead is entirely coincidental'. The programme attempts to discover
who is really supposed to be who in fiction, and 'where writers draw the
line between literature and stitching up their friends, not to mention
getting revenge on their enemies' (9.30). Meanwhile Heartburn (9.30) offers
a big-screen version of the book by Nora Ephron, which is all about a
marriage between Washington media folk. The marriage is ruined by an affair
between the husband, a journalist, and a diplomat's wife. Since Ephron was
married to Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein there has never been too much
mystery about who was really being portrayed. Unfortunately even though Jack
Nicholson and Meryl Streep play the couple it is not the greatest of films.
Radio 3 has an unusual concert of music by Ravel, played by the BBC Welsh SO
(7.30).

<TEXT>
On Wednesday the San Francisco Symphony played the Festival Hall, with a
resounding report. The orchestra is a model of professionalism, high
technical competence and single-minded unanimity, and in Herbert Blomstedt
it has a most judicious music director. If you scent reservations in the
offing, it is only because of the programme: as the main work they chose
Bruckner's Fourth Symphony, the 'Romantic', where something else might have
been better for our side of the Atlantic.
They began with John Harbison's new Oboe Concerto, written very specifically
for their first oboe William Bennett, and first heard last December in their
home town. Harbison's musical idiom is 'accessible' middle-of-the-road (he
was a Boris Blacher pupil), which doesn't preclude individual ingenuities.
The concerto proved quizzical and affable.
It had unmistakable tunes, plenty of lyrical and virtuoso exercise for
Bennett (who delivered it with charm) and appealing jazz-effects. The
composer has an ear for offbeat instrumental combinations: he rings clever
changes on muted brass, and creates whimsical effects with bassoons and an
alto sax. Given the dearth of concerti for oboe it may be gratefully taken
up by other performers.
Bruckner Four is tougher stuff. The orchestra performed it with the utmost
concentration, answering precisely to Blomstedt's every request, with each
section playing like a single musician. On the one hand, this conductor had
a firm grasp on the proportions of the work, set it out in broad paragraphs,
chose unimpeachable tempi and drew high-definition, carefully nuanced
'solos' from his violas, high cellos and violins. The opening was lovely: a
pianissimo thrill in the air, unhurried eloquence in the first brass
phrases.
On the other hand - doubts set in with the second subject, which arrived
without a trace of its natural Austrian lilt. For all his admirable tempi,
Blomstedt's bar-to-bar beat was severely unbending. The big paragraphs
needed more freedom to breathe and speak, and often seemed straitjacketed,
even frog-marched, by the unrelenting rhythm.
Since brass entries in forte struck like mailed fists (more aggressive than
expressive), clocking them in so metronomically evoked the parade-ground
rather than the symphony. Their impact nearly always obliterated the other
orchestral voices - though that might have resulted from unfamiliarity with
the dry acoustic of the Festival Hall.
The net effect was too bald, too hard-edged and unrelaxed for expansive
middle-period Bruckner. I think Bruckner's autumnal place in a precise
middle-European tradition may be hopelessly remote from the Pacific coast of
America.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Arts: Fires in the Mirror - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In August 1991 there were riots in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. They were not
the conventional race riots between black and white, or a black rebellion
against the police and white authority, but between local blacks and the
Hasidim, a group of Jewish mystics which originated in Poland in the 18th
century.
Not much was heard of the affair outside New York, and certainly not outside
America, because the peak of the riots coincided with the coup in Moscow
against Mikhail Gorbachev. But in Brooklyn the incident lingers on.
Anna Deavere Smith has written a play about it. Or rather, and this is the
problem, it is not a play at all. Fires in the Mirror is a documentary on
stage. Others will reach their own conclusion. I enjoyed it because the
material is riveting, but I wonder if the stage is the right place for
it.
Fires is part of a series called On the Road: A Search for American
Character. It is a one woman show. Ms Deavere Smith, an actress and writer,
did all the research herself. She interviewed those involved in the riots,
whether participants, observers or guardians of the peace. And she plays all
the parts, black, Jewish, male, female and anyone who fits in, with the
occasional use of film in the background.
The story that emerges is complex. The riots began with an accident. A
seven-year-old black boy was killed by a Hasidic man whose car jumped the
kerb. Nearby blacks retaliated and attacked a Hasidic scholar, stabbing him
to death. The rioting followed.
The accidental nature of the affair is never far from Mrs Deavere Smith's
account. On the other hand, the tinder was plainly there in advance. The
Hasidim, we learn, make up only about 10 per cent of the neighbourhood, but
seem to have an advantaged position compared to the blacks.
On the Sabbath and other holy days, the New York City authorities close a
number of streets to traffic, much to the inconvenience of the blacks. Other
resentments are not far from the surface.
Ms Deavere Smith's purpose is not to blame, but to explore. Robert Sherman,
of the New York City Commission on Human Rights, is quoted as saying that
Eskimos have 70 different words for snow, then adds: 'We probably have 70
different kinds of bias, prejudice, racism and discrimination.'
The message of Fires seems optimistic: try and understand. Ms Deavere Smith
performs more than 20 roles with great restraint. Some might say that she
underacts, but I think that is part of her purpose: not to be overdramatic.
I should like to see the show on television. The author is now working on
what happened in the Los Angeles riots last year.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Arts: Pelleas et Melisande - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pierre Boulez, reflecting on Pelleas et Melisande before conducting the
opera for the first time (at Covent Garden in 1969), compared Debussy's
nature, as composer, to a cat's, and discerned in the opera a 'swift and
deadly sheathing and unsheathing of claws'. A picture-book new production of
the opera has arrived at the same theatre from Milan (where it was first
shown in 1986) via a 1988 stopover in Vienna; a sense of claws (in Boulezian
terms) in swift, deadly action is exactly what it seems to lack.
No blood is drawn, no real threat of menace or pain offered; the spectator
is not carried upon an ineluctable welling of dramatic movement toward
tragedy. By its lack of fibre, and challenge, the new production is
immediately cordoned off from those recent Pelleas feats of re-discovery -
in Britain alone, by Elder and Pountney at the Coliseum, Boulez and Stein in
Cardiff, and Peter Brook in Glasgow - which now form an essential part of
serious opera performance and experience everywhere.
High-quality ingredients are on offer here. The Milan and Vienna conductor,
Claudio Abbado, returns to Covent Garden after a 10-year absence, along with
three members of his original cast - Francois Le Roux and Frederica von
Stade in the title roles, Patrizia Pace as Yniold. Antoine Vitez, the
producer, died in 1990; his staging, in its Yannis Kokkos designs, has been
placed in the care of Lorenzo Mariani.
In spite of first-night vagaries - chinks of light peeping through castle
walls, rumpled back-cloths, come-and-go lighting, plentiful set-change noise
 -the show looks good, in an airy pre-Raphaelite way. Its Burne-Jones shapes
and proportions have been devised to reflect important thematic concerns in
the opera. Above all, the extinction of light in the lives of its youthful
title-characters: light plays behind a semi-diaphonous black swing-curtain
during the interludes, and its diminution by various forms of filtering is
an integral part of the unfolding of every scene.
It is a setting pregnant with dramatic possibilities for the conductor to
realise. Abbado concentrates on making the score sound limpid and lustrous,
the scoring substantial and picturesque: buoyant rhythms pick up swirling
sea-breezes, delicately fashioned phrasing catches fountain ripples, the
scent of evening air. He is a conductor of extraordinary skill and
sophistication, who achieves his fairy-tale account of Pelleas in a way that
leaves no musical element undisciplined or out of focus. What he avoids is
any acknowledgement of the hard muscle and bare bone of the music, its
nervous system, its dramatic articulation by means of infinitely subtle
combinations of timbre.
Mr Le Roux and Miss von Stade have become rather mature occupants of the
innocent-white costumes they are asked to wear. Both are artists of
wonderful sensitivity, alert to the finest gradations of tonal and verbal
nuance; neither, on this occasion, produced the wholly absorbed, completely
transported account of their roles of which one knows them capable. (Miss
von Stade, it should be said, was not wholly recovered from the illness that
affected her participation in the final dress rehearsal; it would have been
fairer both to her and to the audience to make this information public
before curtain rise.)
This lack of sharp-profiled characterisation, reflected alike in the
conducting and the title parts, is continued in Victor Braun's Golaud,
intelligently conceived and executed but projected with insufficient vocal
thrust. Robert Lloyd, celebrating two decades of leading roles at Covent
Garden, returns as Arkel. It is an even greater pleasure to welcome back the
long-absent Yvonne Minton, whose Genevieve cut across the spaces with a
trenchancy of attack one would wish more widely imitated - Miss Pace's
Yniold likewise, though in demeanour she seems more a fetching gamine than a
carefully observed and enacted boy.
The sum of all this, on Wednesday, was Pelleas as International Opera - of,
admittedly, a high-calibre kind. Since recent seasons at Covent Garden have
taught one to expect more searching presentations of serious opera, a more
inventive blending of international ingredients, it comes as a
disappointment.
In repertory until April 8

FT  26 MAR 93 / Arts: A collector stuck in his age - The 19th-century folly
of Robert Vernon is timeless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Don't make the mistake of presuming that an exhibition of a collection of
British art presented to the nation a century and a half ago has no
relevance to the making and collecting of the art of today.
Robert Vernon's gift of some 157 paintings and eight sculptures to the
fledgling National Gallery in 1847 was intended to prompt the foundation of
a Gallery of British Art (the national British collection opened at the Tate
50 years later). To that patriotic end, Vernon purposely sought works by the
founding fathers of the British School and by his most acclaimed
contemporaries. His collection, a selection of which is currently on show at
the Tate Gallery, offers a number of salutary lessons. It begs the question
of how best to define and represent British art as the debate continues on
the future of the Tate's modern and British holdings.
In his acquisition of works of art, Robert Vernon exhibited all the flair of
a modern museum committee set on pleasing everyone. The collection of this
'Maecenas of Modern Art', as Vernon was dubbed at the time, shows no
evidence of personal passion or real discernment (certainly Pickersgill's
portrait presents him as a dour and bloodless man, and the most unlikely
looking horse dealer). Instead it smacks of the shopping list. Here are the
worthies from the accepted pantheon of British art - Gainsborough, Reynolds,
Benjamin West and Richard Wilson  - plus the most fashionable painters of
the day.
The inventory reads as a grim warning of the extent to which each age
inevitably fails to be its own best judge. There are four glorious works by
J. M. W. Turner, an artist who was never knighted, alongside nine landscapes
by Sir Augustus Wall Callcott. There are 12 paintings by the eminent figure
painter and colourist William Etty, eight by Sir Edwin Landseer, five by Sir
David Wilkie. Messrs Constable and Bonington are each represented by one
picture while Samuel Palmer fails to find a place.
Even a collection catholic enough to embrace Sir Charles Lock Eastlake's
leaden 'Christ Lamenting over Jerusalem', Henry Perronet Briggs' 'The First
Interview between the Spaniards and the Peruvians', Maclise's 'The Play
Scene in 'Hamlet' ', one Theodore Lane's 'The Gouty Angler' and Turner's
ethereal 'The Dogano', cannot claim to be encyclopaedic. There may be
historical and allegorical pictures, genre scenes, landscapes and
topographies, even lowly still-lifes, but Vernon displays the prejudice of
his age in not deeming portraiture as the stuff of Fine Art. Such prejudice
pales beside the intellectual bigotry of our own art establishment for whom
Minimalism seems to reign supreme and no other means of expression is
regarded seriously.
A study of the condition of Vernon's collection should be as sobering for
contemporary artists as for curators of 20th-century collections. There is a
world of difference between, say, the near-enamel finish and pristine hues
of William Mulready, a consummate technician, and the blackened surfaces of
the five history paintings by William Hilton the Younger that are far too
scarred and ravaged to exhibit. Some 30 years after the execution of the
latter's 'Edith and the Monks Searching for the Body of Harold', once
regarded as one of the gems of the Vernon collection, the artist Richard
Redgrave and his brother described it as a 'seamed wreck of his genius'. The
staff at the National Gallery were obliged to turn the picture from time to
time so 'that the eyes and limbs may float back again from whence they had
slipped'.
The 18th and 19th century was a great age of technical experimentation and
of secret systems and recipes allegedly passed down from the great Venetian
colourists. Those, like Hilton, seduced by the prospect of succulent, mellow
colour and perfectly translucent glazes ignored the warnings of the chemists
and continued to use volatile and destructive materials such as bitumen and
megilp. Museums are already spending vast sums conserving ill-made art less
than a decade or two old. What kind of shelf-life can we expect from today's
favoured media of mud and blood?
It is pure arrogance to refuse to learn from history and presume that the
judgments of the 20th century will remain immutable. The reputations of the
likes of Hilton and Eastlake were no more over-inflated than those of
today's chic avant-garde. The latter have jumped on the Establishment
bandwagon with as much calculation as any 19th-century French academic
painter.
We may shudder at the sentiment of Landseer's 'The Cavalier's Pets', and
smirk at Etty's preposterous and titillating allegory of life, 'Youth on the
Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm', but these follies are likely to be as
nothing to the mass of the work that is now entering the Tate's modern
collection in large quantity.
The Vernon Gift, sponsored by Sun Life Assurance, continues at the Tate
Gallery, London, until October 31.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Arts: Yolande Snaith - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual Spring Loaded festival at The Place, in London, is a chance for
the devotee to sample the sometimes weird - and sometimes wonderful -
offering of new dance. It is a bran-tub, a car-boot sale, offering a little
talent, many aspirations, and even more pretensions.
Yolande Snaith is one of the better-known participants, her work concerned
with the semantics of a dance 'language'. During the past decade she has
earned a serious reputation, and her latest piece, Diction, given its first
performance on Wednesday night, is an often ingenious and physically bold
study. Its first half hour won all my attention and interest; a law of
diminishing returns (relating to a diminishing physical interest) obtained
during the remaining 30 minutes.
Miss Snaith proposes dance as a riddle, a game whose laws are arbitrary,
ruled by mad time-keepers. The proceedings echo something of Alice's
chess-board experiences. The dance area is chequered, the white squares
piled with torn-up paper. Six 'pieces' (three men, three women) are directed
by the two umpires, who are also drawn into the play. Routines, frantic
contests, extended repetitions of movement phrases, ensue. Wooden poles,
blindfolds, red cloths, all feature in illogically logical procedures.
Physical meanings - and relationships - are meaningless.
It is clever and, as I have suggested, fascinating for half its length. My
dissatisfaction is concerned with Miss Snaith's reliance upon the new
European dance style (as explored by such creators as Wim van der Keybus and
Anna Teresa de Keersmaker) of falls, leaps that degenerate into slides
across the floor, and bone-jolting crashes to the ground. The 'games' in the
text - passing poles from one to the other; elaborate sign sequences that
are strictly controlled in rhythm; elements of contact improvisation - are
hypnotically intriguing, as routines achieve a ritualistic force. It may be
that Miss Snaith has restricted her movement choices in order to stress the
absurdist relevance of her piece as slowly-shifting minimalism. She is, I
think, too able to rely upon such constraints.
The piece is a teaser. But it fascinates the eye, and it is admirably done
by Miss Snaith, Lauren Potter, Jordi Cortes Molina and their five
colleagues. Design is by Robert Innes-Hopkins; music by David Coulter; and
there is excellent lighting by Mark Parry.
'Diction' was in part made possible by a Barclays' New Stages Award

FT  26 MAR 93 / Management: Absent without leave - Nigel Nicholson examines
ways of encouraging employee attendance in the workplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to absenteeism, is Britain in a poor state of health?
A report published this month by the Industrial Society suggests that it is,
describing how Japanese-owned businesses in the UK outperform British
companies in attendance rates. The report attributes this to better
monitoring and internal communications and to Japanese companies' emphasis
on teamwork.
Absence rates in Britain have been falling over recent decades, partly
reflecting better management and healthier workforces. But the cost in terms
of lost production is still large. Could this be reduced further?
People cannot be expected to fall sick only at weekends or during holidays.
Moreover, one worker's time off for flu is another's escape from infection.
It could be argued that tolerance of reasonable absenteeism - even allowing
workers occasional mental health days - is a goodwill investment and an
insurance against abuse.
This depends upon a high degree of trust and shared awareness between
employers and staff. On this count, British companies do not score highly.
Absence is, for many, a forgotten problem. Records are rudimentary,
communication of attendance data is negligible and control measures are
crude and ill-focused.
For these reasons, getting a grip on absenteeism can yield substantial
savings.
The first step is to ensure that records are accurate and informative,
counting not just crude percentage time lost but also the number of separate
absence spells.
There is a world of difference when it comes to corporate efficiency between
one worker being absent for five working days and five workers each taking
one day off: most firms' records are incapable of making the distinction.
Simple computerised recording systems are widely available which can provide
this and other breakdowns.
The second step is to raise awareness of absence levels across the firm.
Absence has too often been seen as a personnel rather than an operations
issue and line management should have responsibility for monitoring
individual behaviour and achieving improvements. There is a need for
attendance to be seen by everyone as a dimension of performance.
The third step is to provide attendance incentives. Most corporate thinking
about this is limited to a carrot and stick philosophy, often forgetting the
carrot. The stick is discipline. But this can backfire, as in the case of
the company which cracked down on offenders but lacked the means of
discriminating between the unfortunate and the culpable. Although it managed
to cut off the peak of worst offenders, aggregate absence levels rose. The
disciplinary policy netted several who felt unfairly penalised, and the
result was that absence levels for many rose to just below the level at
which sanctions kicked in.
Management had declared the rules of the game and the employees were playing
it accordingly.
If the stick does not work, what about the carrot? Most companies
immediately think this means material rewards. But this raises further
problems. Management, quite understandably, is reluctant to give additional
rewards for what staff are contractually obliged to do and experience shows
the positive effects tend not to last.
The incentive is rarely great enough to be compelling; it looks like
rewarding luck rather than motivation if people are disqualified for
unavoidable illness, and bonuses have a way of becoming assimilated as just
another element of the package.
Research shows the most effective and under-used incentive is almost
costless. It is recognition. Good absence information systems raise
awareness of attendance performance. The most effective disincentive here is
a shared awareness of attributable costs and this is where the Japanese
teamwork culture generates control.
Attendance-motivated workers are found in companies where individuals are
aware of how their absence affects group performance, with the implicit
sanction of group disapproval for abuse. This is only likely to occur where
groups are inter-dependent enough for individual behaviour to be visible.
But how does this relate to illness and stress - cited in the Industrial
Society report as prime causes of absenteeism? The two are connected.
Employees are more liable to become ill when bored, unhappy and demotivated.
Absence has two interacting causes: risk and susceptibility. For example, an
unhealthy lifestyle is a risk factor, and low morale a susceptibility
factor. The risk multiplied by susceptibility equation explains why young
and low-status workers have the highest rates of absence. They are at risk
through lifestyle and health factors, and are most susceptible through their
lower attachment to work.
The Industrial Society confirms the equation. The lowest absence occurs
where risks are minimised through careful hiring policy and preventive
health programmes, and susceptibility is minimised through trust.
Absence is a lens through which poor management practice is magnified. The
Japanese experience shows how the values of involvement and improvement
challenge British management to new ways of managing employee performance.

running alongside the 405 range at Peugeot Talbot's Ryton plant near
Coventry, chief executive Geoffrey Whalen is making time for another hack at
a broader coalface.
In June the bespectacled, donnish Whalen (right), 57, is to take over from
T&amp;N chairman Colin Hope the honorary role of president of the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
It will be the second stint in the presidency for Whalen who, in 1990/91,
had to combine his SMMT role with steering Peugeot Talbot as gently as
possible into what has turned out to be the UK car market's worst recession
since the Second World War.
This time he is returning to the president's office in Forbes House, the
SMMT's elegant HQ in Belgravia, with the market at last showing signs of
upturn.
For all the returning optimism, many reckon that the SMMT president's role
remains mostly an unenviable one.
The SMMT speaks on behalf of importers as well as manufacturers, so the
potential for internecine strife is considerable. A current slanging match
between market leader Ford and Nissan over 'Britishness' is just one
example.
But Whalen has a career background which makes him a particularly adept
pourer of oil on turbulent waters, as well as a deft diplomatist on behalf
of his industry. He has spent much of his working life in personnel and
industrial relations, starting with the National Coal Board, before
progressing, via General Motors' AC Delco components subsidiary, to British
Leyland.
His succession of posts at British Leyland culminated in personnel director
of Leyland Cars, as 1970s shopfloor anarchy was reaching its height. In
comparison with that, any SMMT squabble would be small beer.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Management: A tax brake on relocation - This 'minor' Budget
change will hit companies hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'DRACONIAN', 'unwarranted', 'shock horror' were the words used by companies
to describe the unexpected removal in last week's UK Budget of a 40-year-old
package of tax breaks for moving employees from one part of the country to
another.
What may have seemed to the casual observer a minor technical change is
likely to have a profound effect on relocation. It will make companies more
reluctant to move people and could put some of the hundreds of specialist
relocation firms out of business.
At present most of the 175,000 employees moved by their companies each year
have all their expenses paid for them - from house hunting, insuring empty
houses, estate agency fees to compensation for any disturbance. They may
receive further compansation if they are going to a higher cost area.
In the future, most of these payments will become a taxable benefit. Under
the new rules only Pounds 8,000 of moving expenses will be free of tax, and
the existing Pounds 13,440 tax allowance for moving from a cheaper to a
dearer area is to be removed altogether.
'The Pounds 8,000 ceiling bears no relation to the real costs of moving,'
says John Carolan of Black Horse Relocation Services. He estimates that the
typical cost of moving somebody who lives in an Pounds 80,000 house might be
around Pounds 32,000, including the housing allowance and a loss on resale
of the old home. For employees in larger homes the cost can be greater
still: with Pounds 8,000 barely covering the estate agents fees.
The growing band of specialist firms offering relocation consultancy, home
search, moving and conselling services are beginning to get edgy. 'Employers
are going to think a lot harder before moving people,' says Chareline Gibbs
of New Eras, relocation consultants. 'They will have less money to play
with, and won't use outside services for anything they can do in-house.'
Jean Littlejohn, head of relocation at the Automobile Association, says the
company is going to have to rethink its relocation plans. 'We had set up an
effective and efficient package for moving people. Now a lot of our
employees will think twice before moving.'
The main problem, she argues, will come from the sale of existing
properties. At present the AA offers its employees a guaranteed minimum
price for their houses and if it sells the house for more the employee gets
the extra. Under the new rules, if the house is sold for less - a not
uncommon occurance in a falling market - the employee will have to pay tax
on the difference.
Companies face a serious problem: if they leave their employees to pay the
tax on their moving expenses, it may be difficult to persuade them to move
at all. But if they compansate them for the higher tax by paying them more,
then the total costs of the move can become prohibitively high.
'Instead of relocating 30 to 40 people en masse, companies may just move the
key people. A more tax-efficient way of doing it would be to train new
recruits in the area,' says Gibbs.
Sue Shortland, a relocation expert at the Confederation of British Industry,
agrees: 'It all depends on the added value that a person can bring to the
job,' she says.
Over the past few years companies have already cut down on relocation: tax
benefit or not, it is expensive to move people. Says Shortland: 'The
majority of companies only relocate the employees they have to have. Yet you
can always look that little bit harder to cut costs.'
The Inland Revenue argues that the Budget changes have got rid of an unfair
anomoly. Under the old system, employees being moved by their company not
only had their expenses paid, but the benefit was tax free, those who moved
themselves in search of a better job have to pay all the costs and do not
get any tax breaks either.
Moreover, the Revenue reasons there is no point in giving a tax allowance to
people moving to a more expensive area, when what the government is trying
to do is increase the traffic in the opposite direction.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Management: Down Under the weather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the land of the long weekend, taking an unjustified 'sickie' is an
inalienable right, jealously guarded by workers who spend more time at the
beach than at their desks. Is this an outdated image of Australia, rightly
condemned by politicians and business leaders alike? Or is there a grain of
truth in the caricature? The answer, it seems, is a bit of both.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that abuse of sick leave provisions - the
infamous 'sickie' - is widespread. In justification, most workers will point
to the provisions of the national or state 'award' covering their industry,
in which terms and conditions are laid down by the quasi-judicial Industrial
Relations Commission. Many workers regard the sick leave provisions as an
extra holiday to be taken regardless of good health. This view is encouraged
by managers who rarely require proof of illness.
There is little hard evidence that this free and easy attitude to sick leave
has led to higher overall absenteeism than in other industrialised
countries. Indeed, research* for the Australian government by Bill Merrilees
and Dale Miller from Newcastle University suggests absenteeism is lower in
many industries - banking, construction, distribution and services.
But evidence is emerging** that absenteeism is a significant problem in the
public sector, which includes most of the power generation and
telecommunications industries, as well as public administration, community
services and about half of the transport and storage sector. According to
research by Mark Wooden, associate professor at the National Institute of
Labour Studies at Flinders University in Adelaide, only the dangerous mining
industry suffers worse absenteeism than these industries, which account for
87 per cent of public sector workers.
Wooden says there is insufficient data to be certain about why the public
sector should be more prone to the 'sickie' epidemic. But he suggests the
reasons probably include more generous sick pay provisions, low job
satisfaction, greater job security and less demanding management. 'I don't
think Australians are lazier than anyone else, or any more inclined to take
a day off,' he says. 'People are just responding to the incentives that are
given to them, and in Australia the view is widely held that if the sick
leave days are in the award, they are there to be taken.'

FT  26 MAR 93 / People: Coolbrith crosses Atlantic to Aetna Re UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alison Coolbrith, a 25-year veteran of Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, one of the
largest American composite insurers, has taken over as chief executive of
Aetna Re-Insurance in the UK. She is believed to be the first woman to head
a reinsurance operation in the London market.
Coolbrith, 47, had previously run the property/casualty operations in
northern California, a larger business than the London venture of which she
now takes charge. But she says she was attracted both by an international
job, as well as by the chance to run a complete company, and one on the
reinsurance, not primary side. She comes in over the old board of directors,
with Terry Masters, general manager, reporting to her.
Aetna Re UK was previously a branch office of American Re USA. Aetna
disposed of the latter last September to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts but hung on
to the UK portion of the business. Coolbrith explains that Aetna wanted to
keep a reinsurance operation in the UK to act as a kind of advance warning
system 'because so much happens in the London market that tells us in the US
what we can expect two or three years down the line'.
Since September Aetna has injected Pounds 25m fresh capital into the UK
reinsurer.
Given the 'turmoil' of underwriting years 1989-1991, she says her priority
is to rethink the organisation, a process she aims to complete in the next
five or six weeks. She arrives at a time when the market is contracting
rapidly; just this week Dutch NRG said it intended to withdraw from general
reinsurance.
'We want to be survivors,' she says of her new charge, which concentrates
mostly on the UK and continental Europe, with some Japanese and Australian
business. 'But, while I hate to hear myself say so, I think there is a 50
per cent chance that the 1992 underwriting year will be as unattractive as
the previous three.'

Holograms stored on photorefractive films of polymer could replace hard disc
drives as a means of storing computer data within the next decade.
So believe researchers at IBM's Almaden Research Centre in San Jose,
California, where a polymer film has been developed on to which holograms
can be recorded and then erased - a feat previously only possible using
expensive crystalline material.
The holograms are made by exposing an image on to the film using
intersecting laser beams: no subsequent development process is needed.
Because the recording material is thicker than the light wavelength, several
holograms can be stored in the same spot, so that several billion bits of
information could be stored in the area of a 10 pence coin. IBM: US, 408 927

Printers which produce colour images with the quality of photographs have
largely been the domain of publishing departments or specialist companies.
Now Kodak has launched such a printer aimed at general office use which can
be attached to a computer network.
The ColorEase PS uses thermal dye sublimation, in which transparent dyes are
layered on top of each other to give the high-quality image. The cost of
printing a single sheet costs Pounds 1.68, while the printer costs Pounds
6,795. Kodak: UK, 0442 61122.

Watching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Liquid crystal displays, seen today in notebook computers, are tipped as the
successor to the cathode ray tube in television sets. But to achieve
acceptance researchers have still to make LCDs less expensive, more compact
and more reliable.
GEC's Hirst Research Centre, in London, has demonstrated a technique for
etching the drive circuitry on the same piece of glass as the screen, which
could contribute to this. As well as reducing the size, the technique does
away with the need for an expensive quartz substrate and other components.
The method also increases reliability because it reduces the number of
connections needed to join each pixel, or picture element, to a transistor.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Property Market: No clear trend emerged from IPD results
for February
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NO CLEAR trend emerged from the February results of the Investment Property
Databank (IPD) Monthly Index.
Total returns fell slightly from January to 0.1 per cent. Both capital and
rental values continued to decline, falling by 0.6 per cent and 1.0 per cent
respectively.
The year-on-year measurements showed negligible change in all three sectors.
The 12-month total return figure for All Properties remained negative for
the year to February.
Industrial property succumbed to declining rental values and fell into
second place behind the retail sector, with returns of 0.3 per cent and 0.4
per cent respectively.
Office yields shifted outwards in February to 10.5 per cent; the total
monthly return for the sector fell back to -0.3 per cent.
Despite a slight improvement in the rate of rental value growth for
February, an outward shift in the equivalent yield had an adverse impact on
capital growth, leading to a fall in the total return index of half a point.
However, in the longer term all three measures point to a modest improvement
in the office sector, with total return reaching its highest year-on-year
level since August last year at -5.8 per cent. Returns for the industrial
sector remained positive, improving by 0.3 per cent for the month.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Technology: Laptops pull into port - Docking stations for
notebook computers allow far greater mobility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is no longer just Luke Skywalker and his compatriots from films such as
Star Wars and Alien that are making everyday use of docking stations. At P&amp;O
Properties, in London, managers have also recognised their benefits.
Their docking stations may not be in outer space, but they do give managers
mobility. Notebook computers taken back into the office can be slotted into
the docking stations - almost like slotting a video into a VCR. The docking
stations are connected to the office power supply and computer network, so
the notebook is effectively transformed into a desktop PC.
Because these notebooks double as desktop machines, Stanley Monger-Godfrey,
information technology director at P&amp;O Properties, believes the docking
station approach will enable the company to equip far more of its staff with
portable machines. 'What this means to us is that we can offer the facility
at a fraction of the price,' he says.
Prices vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, as some models are designed
to be used with the notebook's integral screen and keyboard while others are
designed to have a full-sized keyboard, large colour screen and mouse
attached.
Alan Rogers, product manager for portables at Olivetti in the UK, says
purchasers can expect to pay a 10 per cent premium for 'the docking concept'
over a standard desktop PC. That puts the cost of a docking station and
notebook at between Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 4,000. Rogers believes the
premium is a fair price to pay for portability. Interest in docking stations
has been fuelled, he says, by changes in office organisation. 'I believe
there is a requirement in offices today for a more mobile user. I'm in the
office three to four days a week. I may not want to use my PC when I'm out,
but I may want to use it at home. I believe there are more people like me
today.'
Rogers argues the traditional laptop machine does not answer all these
needs. 'I believe people want the machine and the information they work with
during the day. They don't just want computing capacity.'
This idea has contributed, say manufacturers, to an enormous take-off in
sales of notebooks and docking stations. Mike Lunch, director of Toshiba's
UK PC division, believes two further factors have contributed: developments
in technology and price.
Prices dropped because the screen technology became more reliable, and
therefore less expensive, and because market pressures in the recession
forced manufacturers to squeeze profit margins.
By last summer, notebook machines were available with the latest 486 central
processors, full-colour monitors and massive storage. Toshiba machines, for
example, have an internal hard disc which is 2.5 inches wide but can store
205 megabytes of data - enough to store 40m words or their equivalent.
This, says Lunch, means users can get exactly the same facilities on the
notebook that they can on a desktop machine - such as full-colour graphics
and Windows software.
When the independent notebook is opened on a train, building site or at
home, the screen the user sees is identical to the one on the PC in the
office. Network communications apart, the PC can do everything the larger
machines can do.
Deborah Gallo, product marketing manager for Compaq, says these
breakthroughs in screen and processor technology promoted the credibility of
notebooks as primary machines.
The result, says Lunch, is that between 30 and 40 per cent of the more
sophisticated notebooks sold by Toshiba today are sold with a 'desk station'
 -Toshiba's name for the docking station.
IBM reports similar buoyant sales. The company is now selling docking
stations with 50 per cent of its ThinkPad notebooks. With the most powerful
model, which incorporates a colour screen, the percentage is even higher.
Although Monger-Godfrey acknowledges that 'price is paramount', he believes
there are other benefits from using a notebook machine with a docking
station. If a manager's notebook is connected to the company network until
the moment he or she takes it home, the machine will inevitably hold the
latest information from the corporate database - not data that was
downloaded on to a disc that morning, yesterday or even a week ago. 'If
you're working on out-of-date material it can be quite serious,' points out
Monger-Godfrey.
Then there are the niggly details of transferring data from a standard
desktop to a notebook. Notebooks often take different size discs from the
office machine, or one uses double density discs, the other single density -
the sort of problem designed to irritate profoundly non-technical staff.
Losing discs between home and the office can be commonplace in many
organisations.
One reason why Monger-Godfrey has been so willing to purchase docking
stations is that they have fitted in easily with the company's IT strategy.
'They have allowed us to move into the portable arena without compromising
our three-tier strategy for IT or compromising our security.'
This three-tier strategy involves a PC on every desktop - some 500 in all -
linked to a departmental machine running under the Unix operating system.
This, in turn, is networked to a corporate ICL 3900 mainframe computer.
To dispel worries about data security, inevitable with such a high number of
PCs, Monger-Godfrey has built in a series of access control mechanisms at
each level of computing. The same security extends to the notebooks. If one
is stolen the culprit would have to crack the password before getting access
to the information.
Both Rogers and Monger-Godfrey acknowledge there will always be certain
members of staff who will never need to use a notebook - data entry staff,
accounts clerks and so on. Of the 500 staff at P&amp;O Properties,
Monger-Godfrey believes 100 are out on the road much of the time -
surveyors, for example - and so are obvious users of notebook machines. A
further 100 managers, who spend some time out of the office, could also take
advantage of the combined units.
Elsewhere, Rogers believes a growing number of large corporations are
beginning to show an interest in docking stations simply for the flexibility
they deliver. He cites the example of one company in a high-rise building
where the management is keen for the number of internal meetings to grow.
The only current answer is for staff to print out the information on yards
of paper before trudging up and down stairs to attend the meetings.
Some of the more traditional notebook users are also hooking up to docking
stations. Paul Jordan, surveying director with the Willmott Dixon social
housing refurbishment division, has had a laptop computer for several years.
Two years ago he and five colleagues had a single docking station installed
in the office so that they could exploit a standard colour screen and
high-quality printer to make reports writing easier. All that had to be done
was to configure the notebook and portable to work together.
This gave the machine what Jane Burley, product marketing manager at Apple
in the UK, refers to as a 'dual personality'. 'As a notebook, it knows, say,
that it only has a small screen. But once it is in the docking station it
automatically locks on to servers, for example - something it knows not to
do as a notebook.'
Monger-Godfrey is now such a convert that he says he would no longer
consider buying portable machines unless they had docking stations. 'If this
had been around two years ago we'd have bought a lot more. Most of our
people would have had them,' he concludes.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Property Market: Potential corridor of power - Plans to
redevelop land east of London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The East Thames Corridor holds the prospect of a superb bridgehead into
European markets. This . . . will revitalise large areas of east London and
create major new development opportunities throughout the corridor.
This was the optimistic forecast made by Mr Michael Howard, UK environment
secretary, when launching a task force on Wednesday to draw up a planning
framework for the East Thames Corridor, a 30-mile corridor stretching both
sides of the Thames from Docklands to Tilbury and Sheerness.
But behind the rhetoric, the government's proposals smacked of pragmatism,
not vision. Far from imposing a new linear city or any other design
blueprint on the corridor, the government did not put forward any concrete
proposals. The talk was all of frameworks, strategy, flexibility, resolving
conflicting aspirations, co-ordinated approaches and consultation.
The modest expectations the government raised this week were in sharp
contrast with those of 16 months ago when it commissioned a report into the
corridor. At the time, Professor Peter Hall, the government's adviser,
described the corridor's commercial potential as 'mindboggling'.
Prof Hall described the scheme as potentially the biggest urban development
scheme in British history. 'The impact could be truly historic: London's
westward drift, which began four centuries ago, could be reversed,' he said.
The reason for the dilution of these extravagant expectations were laid bare
by a report by planning consultants Llewelyn Davies, which the government
published on Wednesday.
The report acknowledged the opportunity presented by the area. 'Today a
large supply of development land and a newly-found locational advantage as
the UK's gateway to Europe presents an opportunity for the East Thames
Corridor to develop a new and very different role.'
If the area were to enjoy high growth, there would be potential for 182,000
jobs and 128,000 houses by 2015, said the consultants' report. Under this
projection there would be spectacular growth at Dartford based around a new
international station, with high value, high density development also at the
other main corridor sites.
But the report summed up the obstacles thus: 'The East Thames Corridor is
the place where London generates it power and dumps its rubbish. It has an
environment to match.'
It spelled out the psychological and environmental barriers to high-grade
redevelopment of the area. Despite many places of natural beauty and
historic interest, the area is scarred by smoke-stacks, pylons, power
stations, industrial structures, stacks of containers, scrap-yards,
hauliers' yards and lorry parks. Nearly a fifth of the land is contaminated.
'The enduring image is of an area whose environment has been ravaged by
years of industrial use,' said the consultants.
If the full potential of the East Thames Corridor were to be realised, it
would have to break out of this self-perpetuating cycle of environmental
decline. The corridor would have to adopt the same standards as the rest of
London in burying power lines, landscaping roads and generally tidying up
industrial sites.
'It is expensive but it is considered an appropriate price to pay for an
acceptable quality of environment,' said the consultants.
But the costs of upgrading the corridor's environment sufficiently to
attract high levels of investment and growth are large. As well as
decontamination work costing Pounds 200m-Pounds 385m, about Pounds
120m-Pounds 150m would need to be spent on environmental works and Pounds
40m-120m for rerouting power lines over 25 years. Another Pounds 970m for
roads and Pounds 300m on rail would be called for, in addition to more than
Pounds 4bn of road and rail improvements that are already earmarked for the
region.
But large amounts of new investment are not on the cards, according to the
consultants. 'At this stage . . . it would be unrealistic to adopt a
development strategy which is dependent on high volumes of additional
private and public investment,' it said, citing the existing glut of office
and business space.
'The government's preferred approach . . . is to cater for a moderate level
of growth in the corridor. The market is likely to focus on the area's
strengths, in particular its potential for waterside property and housing
and the provision of large business sites close to London,' said the report.
Those cherishing the grand vision of a linear city along the Thames would be
disappointed by the tentative nature of the proposals unveiled this week.
However, planners and local authorities were welcoming. In particular, they
applauded the consultation, co-ordination, the planning framework and the
integration of transport with land use, which were so badly lacking in the
redevelopment of the Docklands.
Yet without extra funds, good intentions are unlikely to be enough. The
attention that has recently been focused on the East Thames Corridor
illustrates the potential - and the enormity - of the task in realising it.

<TEXT>
Why has King's College, Cambridge, done a disappearing act with ballerina
Lydia Lopokova, the one and only woman whose picture used to enliven its
senior 'combination' room's walls?
The official reason for the removal of the painting, by Duncan Grant, is
'restoration'. But dons suspect that the leaden hand of political
correctness is to blame. Besides Lopokova, the picture showed a Peeping-Tom
eyeing her gossamer-clad form from behind a screen - which female members of
the college apparently deemed beyond the pale.
Never mind that the watcher was her husband, John Maynard Keynes. Better to
have no women at all gracing the walls, than one being ogled by a male.

A year after Punch folded, The Cartoonist comes into being. Although it is
being launched on April 1, the fortnightly broadsheet newspaper is no joke.
Backed by the upmarket Coutts, with a handful of small shareholders, it will
have an initial print-run of 100,000 and a cover price of Pounds 1.20. But
says its publisher, John Sorrell: 'If we achieve a settle-down figure of
40,000, we'll be very happy'. He adds: 'We think it is a perfect time to be
launching. In a recession people are desperate for things to smile about.'
But what happens when the recession ends?

<TEXT>
For years Bill Gates' competitors have dreamt of the day he would wed. They
hoped that marriage would distract the chairman of Microsoft, and the
richest bachelor in the US, from his single-minded dedication to building
the world's dominant computer software company.
Hence the stock market's reaction to the news that 37-year-old Gates is to
marry one of his managers, Melinda French, 28, is puzzling, to say the
least. Microsoft's shares might have been expected to fall sharply, while
rival stocks outperformed. But Microsoft's shares have continued to climb
since the announcement.
The only possible explanation is that the market fears that the merger will
lead to the production of several Gates Juniors and that this will create
even more problems for the industry.

Meanwhile, a pertinent question from an impertinent analyst at yesterday's
meeting with Slough Estates's management as it announced the second rights
issue in two years. Why did Sir Nigel Mobbs, a descendant of one of the
founding families, not consider following the example of Barclays, where he
is a director, and split his dual role as chief executive and chairman?
Sir Nigel, currently one of the famous five knights looking for a new chief
executive for the Bank, said the situation was very different - 'not the
same at all.'

<TEXT>
Sad to see Peter Wood, Barclays' able finance director, jumping ship and
joining Standard Chartered, a bank less than a quarter its size. He's the
type of veteran that Barclays can ill afford to lose.
The internal warfare at the top of Barclays, leading to this week's decision
to look outside for a new chief executive, must have been even worse than
suspected. Andrew Buxton and Humphrey Norrington, his vice-chairman, have
been with the bank for over 30 years. But virtually every one else at the
top is a relative new boy. No doubt this results in plenty of fresh ideas
but big clearing banks are conservative institutions where there is a
premium on continuity.
Perhaps Wood felt he had to quit so that he might join the list of external
candidates vying for the new chief executive's job.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Second-half drive helps Henlys cut loss by
Pounds 6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENLYS GROUP, the car and bus business which last summer escaped a hostile
Pounds 32m bid from its rival T Cowie, reduced pre-tax losses by Pounds 6m
to Pounds 848,000 over 1992.
After losing nearly Pounds 900,000 in the first half, the group fulfilled
its bid-defence promise that it would break even in the second half.
It also carried out its plan to pay an unchanged dividend of 3p by
maintaining the 2p final. This was in spite of losses per share of 3.3p
(16.7p).
Henlys, which did not report under the new FRS 3 accounting rules, took an
extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.23m mainly for defence costs. Cowie retains
a 9.9 per cent stake.
At the operating level the group advanced to a Pounds 3.8m profit (Pounds
556,000) on turnover of Pounds 331.1m (Pounds 334.4m). This included Pounds
1.04m in fees for management consultants. Exceptional costs were cut by
nearly Pounds 2m to Pounds 950,000, which related to teething problems on
new bus and coach ranges at the Scarborough factory.
The Plaxton coach and bus division has been the source of the group's
problems. Last year the division cut operating losses to Pounds 1.97m
(Pounds 2.95m) on sales of Pounds 65.9m (Pounds 93.4m).
Mr Robert Wood, chief executive, said the UK market for luxury coaches had
declined from 1.4m in 1989 to 600,000 last year. The group had been left
with Pounds 32m of unsold vehicles when the market collapsed in 1990.
After closures and other cuts which would reduce annual costs by Pounds 5m,
the division was expected to return to profit this year.
Motor retail pushed up operating profit to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 3.5m) with
the help of acquisitions. The group represented 14 manufacturers on 24
sites.
Net debt fell by Pounds 4m to Pounds 26.4m, gearing of 58 per cent, after an
inflow of Pounds 2.5m from disposals.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Domino shares fall 44p on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Domino Printing Sciences, a manufacturer of ink-jet
printers, yesterday fell 44p to 552p as the company issued a warning about
its interim profits.
It said sales growth had been insufficient to cover the cost of investment,
mainly in the US.
Mr Howard Whitesmith, managing director, said operating costs in the six
months to end-April 1993 would exceed operating costs of Pounds 12.8m in the
second half of 1992.
He said, however, that profits would recover by the year end.
However, 'unexpectedly slow' sales in the US in the first three months and
sluggish business in Germany and the Netherlands meant sales would not
outweigh 'planned investments'.
Domino's share price has climbed 53 per cent over the past year. Gearing at
the October 31 year end was 3.32 per cent and the net asset value was Pounds
48.2m.
The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.9m on turnover of Pounds
71.6m in 1991-92 with profits for the half year ahead 32 per cent at Pounds
4.54m.
Linx Printing Technologies, a smaller competitor in the industry, confirmed
the increasing value of markets outside the US and Europe. It said sales
within that area had more than doubled in the six months to end-December
1992.
The warning comes against a background of analysts' fears that growth will
slow significantly in the industry because of a loss of the impetus
generated in the 1980s by changes in EC consumer laws on such markings as
sell-by dates.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Dalepak shares fall 24% on profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dalepak Foods, the frozen foods and ready meals group, yesterday warned that
trading conditions had worsened since its interim results in January. The
shares fell from 264p to 201p.
Even in January the company was expecting full-year profits to be down.
Interim pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 1.6m.
Yesterday it said profits would be 'significantly below market expectations'
and analysts are now looking for profits of about Pounds 2.2m compared with
Pounds 3.9m in the year to end-April 1992.
Mr Chris Ivory, chief executive, said there had been 'further substantial
increases in the cost of raw materials, especially beef.' Beef prices were
up by 25 per cent on a year ago and by 15 per cent since January.
He said price increases were not being fully passed on to supermarkets.
Margins were squeezed as trading volumes were low and supermarkets
concentrated on price promotions and lower priced foods.
However, Mr Ivory said the balance sheet was strong and Dalepak expected to
maintain its total dividend at 6p for the year to April. The group said it
remained confident about long-term prospects.

will be consolidated into one ordinary 1p share. The deferred shares and the
company's share premium account will be cancelled.
The Pounds 7m of new equity will be raised through the issue of 700m new 1p

of Pounds 12.6m for 1992, compared with Pounds 10.7m. Turnover fell from
Pounds 84.9m to Pounds 82.1m.

reorganisation and revaluation costs. Losses per share came out at 49.27p

Action taken to dispose of loss-making shops and to cut costs contributed to
achieving break-even trading in the second half with sales improving

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Exploration costs cut Monument Oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MONUMENT OIL and Gas, the exploration and production company, reported an
after-tax profit of Pounds 4.1m for the 12 months to December 31, down from
Pounds 6.5m in 1991, as it continued to fund high exploration costs and
pre-development work on the Liverpool Bay project.
The company has secured Pounds 10m in debt funding for pre-development work
on the Liverpool Bay oil and gas fields which are estimated to contain
1,000bn cu ft of gas and 200m barrels of oil. The development is dependent
on construction by PowerGen of the Connah's Quay power station in Clwyd
which has been delayed by the government's energy review.
Mr Tony Craven-Walker, chief executive, said that further delays affecting
the project, 'will act as a disincentive for future investment in energy
related projects with accompanying loss of jobs.'
Turnover improved slightly to Pounds 38.8m (Pounds 38.6m). Earnings per
share slipped from 0.99p to 0.62p.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BAA sells electrical distribution networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the privatised British airports operator, has sold for Pounds 90m the
electrical distribution networks of its three London airports, Heathrow,
Gatwick and Stansted, to London Electricity.
The sale is part of BAA's strategy of concentrating on its core airport
skills, Sir John Egan, the chief executive, said yesterday.
The transaction will not have any material effect on BAA's trading profits,
but the company said it would significantly improve its debt position and
help in the funding of large capital projects.
BAA recently filed a planning application for the construction of a fifth
terminal at Heathrow expected to cost between Pounds 800m and Pounds 900m.
Under the terms of the sale, London Electricity will acquire the high and
low voltage electricity distribution cables and associated electrical
equipment of the three airports.
The utility will also take over responsibility for the operation and
maintenance of the systems in return for an annual fee which has been set at
Pounds 13.5m for the first year. The fee will increase in future years
depending on inflation and demand.
BAA said it had invited its staff who currently run the networks to become
employees of London Electricity.
The airport operator also added that its customers, including airlines,
baggage handling companies and retailers, will not be affected by the change
of ownership. They would not face any increase in their electricity charges
and would continue to buy their electricity through BAA.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Canning falls to Pounds 4.5m after poor
final quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
W CANNING, the Birmingham-based speciality chemicals and electronics
distribution group, saw profits fall again last year to reach about half of
the levels of 1989 and touch the bottom of the recessionary cycle.
Pre-tax profits in the year to December 31 were Pounds 4.48m compared with
Pounds 5.72m. This translated into earnings per share of 8.2p, down from
12.2p.
Although this covered dividend payments - maintained at 7.29p after a final
of 4.35p - the costs taken below the line of closing the Spanish electronics
business meant that for the second year running Canning had to dip into
reserves to give shareholders a return.
Mr David Probert, chairman, said that the group had expected increased 1992
profits until a sharp downturn across the business in the final quarter.
He described Canning's second half as 'one of the most difficult periods of
trading in its long history.'
This led to a Pounds 3m reduction in turnover to Pounds 114m.
The effect of sterling's devaluation was marked on the balance sheet.
Foreign borrowings, which had been matched against foreign assets, increased
in sterling terms and gearing rose to 62 per cent, against 57 per cent at
the end of 1991. However, gearing is set to decline by 19 percentage points
when the group draws in Pounds 4.75m on April 2 from the sale of a French
adhesives tapes company.
The immediate outlook is more encouraging. There are signs of an upturn in
the UK and chemicals demand from south-east Asia is increasing as exports
obtain a competitive advantage from sterling's devaluation. But the
important French and German markets are sluggish and the demand for
electronic components is flat.
Canning has been re-positioning its business. Investment this year will be
on the chemicals side and there are not expected to be any chemicals
disposals, possibly foreshadowing the group's departure from electronics
distribution.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: John Laing recovers to Pounds 11.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE A Pounds 21.4m provision and poor trading conditions in the UK
housing and construction markets, John Laing bounced back into the black
last year.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 11.6m compared with a Pounds 65.3m loss in 1991
when write-downs were even higher at Pounds 87.8m
Operating profits rose 41 per cent to Pounds 30.1m (Pounds 21.4m) despite a
fall in sales to Pounds 1.27bn (Pounds 1.59bn).
A maintained final dividend of 6p makes a same-again total for the year of
9p, just covered by earnings of 9.44p (losses of 57.4p).
The shares dipped 3p to 235p on concern that the good results from the UK
contracting division were unlikely to be repeated in the current year.
Construction profits rose from Pounds 21.8m to Pounds 25.1m despite a 24 per
cent fall in divisional turnover to Pounds 1.08bn (Pounds 1.42bn).
Mr Martin Laing, chairman, said the group had benefited from payments for
higher margin contracts won before the UK construction market became more
difficult. These included payments for work on the new Sizewell power
station in Suffolk.
Overseas construction profits, mostly from the Middle East and south-east
Asia, rose from Pounds 3m to Pounds 5m on increased turnover of Pounds 40m
(Pounds 30m).
Housing operations also returned to profit, with Pounds 4.8m after a Pounds
2.8m loss in 1991. The improvement was due to an increase in the number of
homes sold, from 1,670 units to 2,175 units in the UK, and better margins
following previous land write-downs and as more expensive land bought in the
late 1980s has been used up.
Mr Laing said the company had seen a 35 per cent rise in net reservations in
the first three months of this year compared with the corresponding period
last year. Margins and selling prices, however, remained weak.
COMMENT
Contracting profits are likely to more than halve this year as the UK
construction cycle moves against this group and as order books have fallen.
Laing, however, should benefit from rationalisation following a 25 per cent
reduction in staff in the construction division. Margins on contracts remain
better than most UK builders and civil engineers can boast. Housing profits
should be at least as good as in 1992 and could be better if the market
continues to improve and prices start to harden. Profits of Pounds 17m would
put the company on a prospective p/e of more than 16. On this evidence it
remains one of the best contractors around but in a weak construction
market.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bupa off sick list with Pounds 36.5m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BUPA, Britain's biggest private healthcare group, which has been
reorganising under a new management team since losing Pounds 38.2m in 1990,
yesterday reported a 1992 pre-tax surplus of Pounds 36.5m, against Pounds
1.3m last time.
'We are off the sick list and much, much stronger,' said Mr Peter Jacobs,
chief executive.
Bupa, a provident association, is Britain's biggest health insurer and
private hospital operator with nearly half the insurance market and 30
hospitals with 1,900 beds.
Reserves rose from Pounds 311.8m in 1991 to Pounds 349.1m last year, in
spite of a property revaluation which led to a Pounds 14.4m decrease in
reserves in 1992.
The insurance side's solvency ratio rose from 39 per cent in 1991 to 44 per
cent last year. The UK health insurance operations, which lost Pounds 26.7m
in 1991, managed a small Pounds 1.7m profit.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Property profit helps to keep Appleyard
Pounds 1.7m in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS OF Pounds 2.4m on a property deal and the sale of spare advanced
corporation tax capacity kept Appleyard Group, the motor dealer, in the
black last year when pre-tax profit slipped from Pounds 1.81m to Pounds
1.71m.
The group halved its final dividend to 2.6p, making a total of 5.2p (7.8p),
which was not covered by earnings of 2.3p (2.5p).
After dipping into reserves for the second year running, the retained loss
was Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 2.49m).
Turnover fell to Pounds 305m (Pounds 390m) reflecting the sale of Ford
dealerships and petrol stations in 1991.
Mr John Atkin, business development director, said ongoing sales were
slightly down.
Operating profit declined to Pounds 3.43m (Pounds 5.81m) including property
profits of Pounds 1.37m (Pounds 1.58m).
Ian Skelly, bought for Pounds 18.3m in 1989, incurred losses.
Mr Atkin said it had run out of VW Golfs early in August, the crucial
selling month. He blamed the importer, which was then Lonrho. The
manufacturer has since bought out the agreement.
Skelly's large sites had also been particularly vulnerable to recession. A
hundred jobs had been shed and other overheads cut.
The car leasing joint venture with Barclays Bank contributed Pounds 1.9m
(Pounds 530,000), although this included Pounds 1.01m from the sale of spare
ACT capacity.
Net debt fell to Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 14.1m) and interest costs came down to
Pounds 3.61m (Pounds 4.54m). The group also has off balance sheet borrowings
in the leasing joint venture.
Appleyard also announced the acquisition of a Mercedes-Benz dealership in
Reading for Pounds 2.3m. This would be paid for by a Pounds 4.15m sale and
leaseback deal on sites at Gateshead and Oxford.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: APV dips to Pounds 21m and warns on first
six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in APV fell 11p to 101p after the food processing equipment
specialist announced a drop in profits and warned that pressure on prices
would affect its results for the first half of this year.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 26.7m to Pounds 21.1m in the year to
December 31, on sales up by 8.4 per cent to Pounds 947m. APV sells about 80
per cent of its products overseas and suffered from generally poor economic
conditions worldwide.
The profit figure was depressed by an exceptional charge of Pounds 6.3m. The
net profit on disposal of discontinued operations, less amounts provided for
losses on operations to be discontinued, was Pounds 13.7m. In addition,
Pounds 20m was charged in respect of ongoing business reorganisations.
Mr Clive Strowger, appointed chief executive in June, has started extensive
restructuring to focus the group and increase profit margins. The balance
sheet was strengthened by the Pounds 56m sale of Vent-Axia, its fans and
hand drier business, to Smiths Industries in December.
APV's workforce fell by 1,000 to 11,600 at the year end, not counting the
400 employees who moved with Vent-Axia. That disposal and reductions in
working capital helped cut gearing from 42 to 12 per cent.
Mr Strowger said the group had been reorganised to align its businesses more
closely with customers and markets. It would also seek to broaden its
customer base more towards industrial sectors.
Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, said: 'We enter 1993 with orders 9.3 per cent
lower than a year ago but the board is confident that good progress is being
made with repositioning the group for future profitable growth.
In spite of a drop in earnings per share from 5.4p to 3.4p, the final
dividend is held at 3.4p to maintain the total at 5.4p.
COMMENT
The new management team have a big job on their hands, but seem to be
setting about it with a will. APV made a lot of acquisitions in the
eighties, but did little to integrate the businesses - or even impose
uniform financial reporting. In spite of strong market positions and sales,
the group has seen profits melt away as recession increased pressure on
prices. These figures were at the low end of expectations, and the share
price also responded to the group's caution over the immediate trading
outlook. Forecast profits of Pounds 27m put it on a multiple of 17.5. APV
continues to be seen as a candidate for takeover - but that should support
its share price, as will the group's strong recovery potential and
determination to maintain the dividend, giving a high yield.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Woodchester declines to IPounds 35m despite
purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in the UK and last autumn's ERM crisis were the principal
causes of an 11 per cent fall in 1992 pre-tax profits from IPounds 39.6m to
IPounds 35.4m (Pounds 35.6m) at Woodchester Investments, the Dublin-based
leasing and banking group.
The results were in line with market expectations for the company, in which
Credit Lyonnais has a 48.7 per cent holding.
Over the year the asset base rose 25 per cent to IPounds 1.4bn (IPounds
1.12bn) and the deposit base 65 per cent to IPounds 571m, largely as a
result of the March 1992 acquisition of UDT First Southern Bank.
Analysts estimated that bad debt provisions have only marginally risen from
IPounds 15m to about IPounds 17.5m, a far better performance, they say, than
many leasing companies in the UK, which have been badly hit by recession.
An estimated IPounds 2.5m was incurred in hedging costs during the last
quarter as short-term interest rates soared during the ERM crisis and the
punt came under pressure following sterling's devaluation.
The funding base comes largely from corporate deposits at one-month rates,
while the group had hedged at longer rates of three and six months, analysts
say.
A similar loss is estimated for the first part of 1993, before the crisis
ended with the punt's devaluation.
Earnings per share were 15.1p, compared with 17p last time.
A final dividend of 2.69p (2.24p) is recommended for a total increased from
3.75p to 4.5p.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Community Hospitals downturn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INTEREST charges depressed pre-tax profits at Community Hospitals Group, the
private hospital and nursing home company, from Pounds 2.68m to Pounds 1.86m
for the six months to December 31.
Mr Alan Dexter, chief executive, blamed the conjunction of two events: the
completion of two large developments resulting in higher interest and a fall
in hospital revenues.
Completion of the developments resulted in a charge to the profit and loss
account of previously capitalised interest. Charges were Pounds 865,000,
against a previous gain of Pounds 154,000.
In January the group spent Pounds 5m to acquire three nursing homes.
The 'best view' of profits for the full year showed a range of Pounds 6m to
Pounds 6.5m, against Pounds 6.8m in 1992.
The continuing care division raised operating profits from Pounds 540,000 to
Pounds 660,000 in the first half while the hospital division reported static
profits at Pounds 2.1m. Group turnover was Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 19.3m).
The interim dividend is maintained at 2.4p, payable from earnings of 4.3p
(6.2p) per share.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wm Morrison up 34% and looks south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WM MORRISON Supermarkets, the Bradford-based grocery retailer, yesterday
announced a 34 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 83.8m and
indicated that it might expand southwards.
Mr Martin Ackroyd, finance director, said the company, which has 59
superstores in northern England, was searching for a new warehouse which
could service its existing outlets, but also allow Morrison to widen its
trading area.
'We are unlikely to go further north, and that means we are interested in
going further south.'
The southwards move would be limited at first, but in later years expansion
plans were limited only 'to the mainland.'
Pre-tax profits for the year to January 30 rose from Pounds 62.6m to Pounds
83.8m, on turnover up 18 per cent to Pounds 1.32bn (Pounds 1.12bn).
Like-for-like sales increased 4.6 per cent, and the net operating margin
improved from 6.1 per cent to 6.4 per cent for the year, in spite of a fall
to 5.8 per cent at the interim stage.
Profits were also boosted by interest received of Pounds 3.9m, against a
Pounds 3.8m charge previously, thanks to the Pounds 98m rights issue in
November 1991.
Earnings increased to 7.23p (6.16p) fully diluted and 7.71p (6.59p) basic.
The increased final dividend of 0.64p raises the total to 0.8p (0.67p).
Mr Ackroyd said staff costs and overheads rose broadly in line with sales,
but the depreciation charge increased Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 23.3m.
Some Pounds 1.1m of the increase was accounted for by the policy, adopted
last May, of depreciating freehold land assets. This recognised that the
alternative use value of sites might be much less than their food retailing
value.
Morrison, recently named top-performing company by the Institute of
Directors, opened six superstores last year at Beverley, Walsall, Mansfield,
Oldham, Kendal and Lincoln.
It is adding new space as a percentage of its total selling area at a faster
rate than any of its bigger national rivals.
COMMENT
The news that Morrison may move south is cause for alarm for the bigger
national chains. The company's refusal to pay more than a fraction of what
its competitors hand over for new sites has allowed it to match them in its
service and merchandising range, but undercut them in price. It also allowed
the company to expand its sales base last year by 12 per cent, with only a
Pounds 3m cash outflow. A resurgent Asda, which has a similar selling
proposition and competes in the same areas, could be a threat, but Morrison
has scope to reduce prices further if necessary. With current-year profits
forecast at about Pounds 100m, the shares are on a prospective multiple of
18.3 - a big premium to the sector, but Morrison offers the fastest profit
growth.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Drayton Asia withdraws its reconstruction
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Drayton Asia, the Far East investment trust, is dropping the
reconstruction proposals it formulated in an attempt to defeat a bid from
EFM Dragon Investment Trust.
Drayton Asia said it had abandoned the proposals because CIN, the manager of
the British Coal Pension funds, had said it would vote against the plans.
CIN has a 20.1 per cent stake in Drayton Asia; the proposals would have
needed 75 per cent approval. CIN also has a 20.8 per cent stake in EFM
Dragon and a controlling interest in Edinburgh Fund Managers, which runs the
rival trust.
Drayton said it invited EFM Dragon to participate in its proposals and
explore ways of modifying them to offer shareholders the option of receiving
Dragon shares and cash. Dragon rejected the approach.
The Drayton proposals would have offered shareholders a choice between a
unit trust and a new split capital investment trust.
Mr Ratan Engineer, chairman of Drayton Asia, said 'shareholders should
continue to reject the bid until they are offered at least a suitable cash
alternative.'
However, Mr Iain Watt of EFM Dragon, said that Drayton was in 'complete
disarray'.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Short-term truck rentals behind Dawsongroup
leap
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASING demand for short-term truck rental helped Dawsongroup, the
commercial vehicle concern, to multiply pre-tax profits more than four times
from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 4.75m last year.
Mr Peter Dawson, chairman and chief executive, said: 'In recession, a large
number of vehicle operators have sought to defer capital investment and
long-term commitments by turning to short-term rental.'
The group invested Pounds 10.5m in new equipment for the short-term fleet.
Sales rose from Pounds 43m to Pounds 46.7m.
Rentals increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 982,000 to Pounds 4.2m on the
back of new contracts from companies no longer interested in long-term
contracts.
The commercial vehicles division increased pre-tax profits from Pounds
144,000 to Pounds 534,000. Sales rose only marginally and a large part of
the increase represented additional trucks sold to the group's rental
division.
Group operating profits rose from Pounds 6.26m to Pounds 8.99m. Net interest
fell to Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 5.1m).
Earnings per share increased to 10.4p (2.7p). The final dividend is raised
to 2.25p for an increased total of 3p (1.5p).

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Caird falls 41% after difficult second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caird Group, the waste management company which released a profits warning
last November, yesterday announced a 41 per cent fall in pre-tax profits,
slightly below revised market expectations.
Caird, which on Wednesday announced the departure of Mr Peter Linacre, its
controversial chief executive, said pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 6.87m
to Pounds 4.04m in the year to December 31. Interim profits were up slightly
at Pounds 3.15m (Pounds 3.11m).
The company said the second half of the year was difficult, with landfill
sites affected by weakening prices. The specialist waste division performed
satisfactorily in 'recessionary' conditions.
Turnover fell to Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 26.2m) following disposals and lower
revenued from landfill.
Earnings per share were 0.4p (4.76p). The directors are not paying a final
dividend on the ordinary shares. As a result, the total for the year was
1.33p (2.7p).
After payment of interim and preference dividends, there was a retained loss
of Pounds 994,000 (Pounds 10.6m).

<TEXT>
MAI, the financial services and media company headed by Labour peer Lord
Hollick, appears to have set its sights on Intrum Justitia, Europe's largest
debt collection agency, as its next takeover target.
MAI announced yesterday that it had increased its holding in the
Dutch-based, but UK quoted, company by 1.3 per cent to 17.4 per cent.
Intrum's shares were steady yesterday at 88p. The market has been
speculating for some time on MAI's intentions towards Intrum.
However, any bid attempt would have to receive the backing of Mr Bo
Goranson, Intrum's chief executive, who owns more than 30 per cent of the
group.
Earlier this month, Intrum announced a 26 per cent rise in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 16m. Net borrowings were reported at Pounds 16.6m, for gearing of
27 per cent.
Mr Goranson has said that the group, which has been acquisitive in recent
years, now intended to consolidate. Half of its sales are generated in
Scandinavia, while the UK provides some 29 per cent of turnover.
MAI recently announced a 12 per cent advance in interim pre-tax profits to
Pounds 33.9m.

THOMAS COOK, the German-controlled travel agency which played a decisive

earlier this month, yesterday announced a significant recovery in profits
for 1992.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 25.3m, against Pounds 8.9m depressed by the Gulf
war. Turnover increased 13 per cent to Pounds 486.5m (Pounds 429.6m) with
international activities growing by 15 per cent while the UK side gained 12
per cent.
The recovery was led by strong contributions from the leisure travel and
foreign exchange businesses.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Booker drops to Pounds 91m following
catering setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOKER, the food distribution and agribusiness group, suffered its first
fall in profits since 1980 with a pre-tax outcome for 1992 down from Pounds
103.9m to Pounds 91m. The shares fell 29p to 410p.
The bulk of the fall was caused by problems at Booker Fitch, the catering
food service business, which made a small loss at the pre-tax level. It had
taken on new business some of which was unprofitable, and had neglected its
existing operations. Trading conditions were poor anyway as fewer people ate
out.
Booker does not disclose profits for the activity, but analysts estimated
that it made between Pounds 12m and Pounds 13m the previous year. New
management has been installed and Booker is ending unprofitable contracts.
The food distribution division saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 57.2m to
Pounds 46.9m. Agribusiness profits were little changed at Pounds 20.3m
(Pounds 20.7m), while fish and prepared foods made Pounds 20.5m (Pounds
18.4m).
Mr Jonathan Taylor, chief executive, said that 1992 was 'a good year to have
behind us'. He said the emphasis had been on cutting costs.
Although the pre-tax figure was in line with expectations, the market was
surprised by a Pounds 23.7m (Pounds 31.9m) extraordinary debit and a rise in
gearing from 71 to 95 per cent.
Group sales were Pounds 3.4bn (Pounds 3.3bn) and operating profits were
Pounds 109.6m (Pounds 122.8m) boosted by profits of Pounds 4.4m from
acquired businesses and including Pounds 5m (Pounds 1.7m) from discontinued
businesses. Restructuring in the US, where the chicken and turkey breeding
business lost significant market share, cost Pounds 12.9m, but this was
offset by a Pounds 17.1m profit on sale and leasebacks.
Earnings per share fell 16.3 per cent to 30.4p (36.3p). A maintained final
of 14.25p is proposed to give an unchanged total of 21.75p.
Under FRS 3 pre-tax profits were Pounds 67.9m (Pounds 63.6m) mainly because
the extraordinary item moves above the line.
COMMENT
Booker chose a bad day to release these results but even so it demonstrated
once again its capacity to disappoint. A year ago forecasts had been for
Pounds 115m pre-tax. There are some encouraging signs; a return to profits
in the turkey and salmon businesses, good performances from the Portuguese
cash and carry operation and the prepared foods side. But the main problem
of poor trading conditions in UK food distribution combined with management
errors will take some time to come right. Forecasts of about Pounds 98m
suggest a p/e of 13, and the thinly covered yield is 6.6 per cent.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: British Alcan cuts losses as reorganisation
costs fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER 1,100 jobs were lost at British Alcan Aluminium and capital
investment was cut savagely last year as the group struggled to cope with
the worst aluminium industry conditions in living memory.
The pre-tax loss was reduced from Pounds 45.6m to Pounds 15.9m after
charging sharply lower reorganisation and plant closure costs of Pounds 4.6m
(Pounds 29.6m).
British Alcan, a subsidiary of Alcan of Canada, generated a positive cash
flow, which enabled debt to be reduced from Pounds 192.3m to Pounds 184.1m.
Cost reduction measures had provided more than Pounds 40m of annual savings
and productivity gains, said Mr Douglas Ritchie, chairman.
However, the outlook for 1993 was 'difficult for the whole of the aluminium
industry, including British Alcan. Measures to return to profitability are
having success, but it is difficult to see a return to the profit levels
experienced in 1987 and 1988 without a significant upturn in economic
activity and aluminium prices.'
The workforce fell from 9,511 to 8,324 last year. When the group was formed
in 1982 by a merger of British Aluminium and Alcan Aluminium it employed
14,000.
Turnover rose to Pounds 756m (Pounds 731m) while aluminium sales volumes
were up by 15 per cent to 333,400 tonnes. Export sales advanced by 20 per
cent to Pounds 275m.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bemrose in Pounds 21m cash call to fund
acquisition
</HEADLINE>

   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEMROSE Corporation, the Derby-based security and promotional printer,
yesterday announced a 1-for-2 rights issue at 265p to raise Pounds 21.1m.
The proceeds will be used to fund the acquisition of the outstanding 50 per
cent of a US joint venture company, Bemrose Yattendon, and reduce the
borrowings of the enlarged group.
The shares gained 17p to close at 343p yesterday.
At the same time, the company announced the acquisition for Pounds 4m of
Barnard and Jackson, a leading UK diary manufacturer based in north London,
and reported a 24 per cent increase in 1992 pre-tax profits, helped by 'an
excellent contribution from BYI.'
Group pre-tax profits in the 53 weeks to January 2 increased to Pounds 6.26m
(Pounds 5.06m), on turnover of Pounds 49.7m (Pounds 48.6m).
Earnings per share advanced by 22 per cent to 24.28p (19.87p).
The final dividend of 7.45p makes an unchanged 11.75p total for the year.
Under the terms of the proposed US deal, Bemrose will pay Yattendon
Investment Trust an initial Pounds 11m for the stake in BYI and make a
deferred cash payment of Dollars 2.5m (Pounds 1.76m) a year later.
In addition, Bemrose will consolidate BYI's net debt of Dollars 18.7m at the
start of January.
BYI is a holding company for three US businesses involved in the supply of
promotional products to the US specialty advertising industry. The
businesses are Souvenir, Renaissance and Janesville. Last year the group
posted pre-tax profits of Dollars 5.81m (Dollars 3.37m) on turnover of
Dollars 64.9m (Dollars 59.5m).
Mr Rodger Booth, Bemrose's chief executive, said the acquisitions
represented significant steps for the group. 'We are pleased to increase our
ownership of BYI to 100 per cent as the recovery in the US specialty
advertising industry is emerging.'
He added that 'the acquisition of Barnard and Jackson will provide
significant synergies when combined with our existing diary activities.
Overall, prospects for the enlarged group in 1993 are encouraging.'
The rights issue of 8.4m shares has been underwritten by SG Warburg.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Revised strategy holds back Reckitt - Extra
marketing costs for brand promotion could be found from productivity gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANGE in strategy towards more promotion of its brands and new product
development held back 1992 profits at Reckitt &amp; Colman, the household goods
group.
Sir Michael Colman, chairman, said that despite difficult trading conditions
the results 'exhibited the strength of the brands behind this business which
have held up remarkably well'.
Pre-tax profits for the year to January 2 on the old accounting basis were
slightly lower at Pounds 248.3m (Pounds 252.3m), although profits reported
under FRS 3 were down sharply to Pounds 181.7m (Pounds 234m).
The FRS 3 figure included trading losses of Pounds 9.6m from the US spice
and seasoning business. The Pounds 47.3m cost of selling it last summer hit
profits as did a Pounds 9.6m reorganisation charge.
Sir Michael said the proposed increase in the final dividend to 10.25p would
give a 7.3 per cent increase in the total to 16.2p (15.1p) reflecting the
policy of consistent dividend growth.
He said the rise also showed the board's confidence in the revised strategy,
although he admitted that the short-term effect would be to hold back
profits.
Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive, said extra marketing costs could be found
from productivity gains and margins had been maintained at high levels.
Operating margins from continuing businesses were 15.2 (15.1) per cent.
Group sales were Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds 1.99bn) although those from continuing
business were virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.85bn. Operating profits from
continuing operations were Pounds 281.7m (Pounds 280.7m) and total operating
profits were Pounds 272.1m (Pounds 292.6m). Interest charges were Pounds
33.5m (Pounds 40.3m).
Earnings fell to 25.16p (37.9p) on an FRS 3 basis or 40.51p (41.76p) on SSAP
6.
Operating profits in the UK rose 2.2 per cent to Pounds 70.1m, with improved
productivity raising margins from 18.8 to 19.7 per cent. In the rest of
Europe profits fell from Pounds 79.1m to Pounds 71.6m as recession began to
affect the business. North American profits fell 5.5 per cent to Pounds
39.6m as the costs of launching a new electric air freshener cut the margin.
Profits from Australasia and Asia fell from Pounds 42.3m to Pounds 40.5m,
despite strong growth in south-east Asia. Profits from Africa rose by a
third to Pounds 28.2m and from Latin America by 14.6 per cent to Pounds
31.7m.
Mr Iain Dobbie, finance director, said exchange rate moves had added Pounds
58.1m to its foreign currency borrowings, though the profit and loss
account, which uses average rates, had hardly been affected. There should be
a significant currency benefit this year.
COMMENT
Reckitt's solidity is ideal in recessions. The new strategy, first outlined
last year, appears sensible. And the conservatism of the management is
comforting. However, unlike Colman's mustard, the shares are not going to
light fires in investors' hearts for a while. Once the brand promotion
strategy begins to come through to profits, though, the shares should do
well, especially with the progressive dividend policy. Forecasts are in the
Pounds 280m to Pounds 290m area, for a p/e of about 13.5.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wolstenholme Rink rises 49%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolstenholme Rink, the printing industry supplier, reported pre-tax profits
for 1992 up 49 per cent, from Pounds 2.32m to Pounds 3.46m.
Turnover slipped from Pounds 53.4m to Pounds 49.9m.
The Lancashire-based company, which also makes metal powders, said business
remained difficult in the UK but widespread export sales and the inclusion
of PCO, acquired at the end of 1991, had helped.
Earnings per share increased 43 per cent to 29.3p (20.5p). The proposed
final dividend is 10.5p for a total of 17p (16.3p).
Gearing was reduced from 50 per cent to 29 per cent at the year-end.
The share price gained 10p to close at 453p.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Nationals help Utd Newspapers to Pounds
110m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance by Express Newspapers helped lift United Newspapers to
pre-tax profits of Pounds 110m in 1992.
Operating profit rose 14 per cent, from Pounds 104m to Pounds 119m, on sales
of Pounds 832m (Pounds 819m).
Lord Stevens, United's chairman, said the improvement in operating profit
reflected 'an excellent performance in Express Newspapers and encouraging
results elsewhere, most notably in regional newspapers, US advertising
periodicals, Morgan-Grampian and PR Newswire.'
The higher profit levels had been achieved despite 'acute competition and
poor trading conditions.'
Operating profit at the group's national newspapers - the Daily and Sunday
Express and the Daily Star - increased 36 per cent from Pounds 24.3m to
Pounds 33m, helped by the relaunch of the Sunday Express as a tabloid.
Overall profit figures are complicated not just by the FRS 3 accounting
standard, but also by disposals, closures and investments.
The Pounds 110m pre-tax figure, up from an adjusted Pounds 48.8m the
previous year, also benefited from a net Pounds 10.4m from the sale of
Reuter shares.
The 1991 figures included net exceptional costs of Pounds 28.8m relating to
losses on the sale of businesses. The restatement reflects the altered
treatment of goodwill.
Excluding all the exceptional items, pre-tax profit rose from Pounds 77.6m
to Pounds 99.5m.
A 0.5p increase takes the final dividend to 14p and the year's total to
21.5p (21p). Earnings rose from 10.9p to 40.1p.
Mr Derek Terrington, publishing analyst at Kleinwort Benson, described the
result as 'good across the board.' Given the degree of cost-cutting achieved
the company seemed well placed for recovery.
Mr Terrington is looking for pre-tax profits of Pounds 110m next year,
against Pounds 99.5m this time excluding exceptionals.
Mr Graham Wilson, group managing director, warned that any signs of economic
recovery were patchy and specific to individual publishing markets.
The share price rose 17p to 588p.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Vauxhall record result bucks trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, more than doubled
1992 operating profits from Pounds 128.4m to a record Pounds 269.1m.
The result was achieved despite the deep recession in the UK new vehicle
market and when Ford of Britain and Rover suffered continuing losses and
Peugeot Talbot's pre-tax profits fell by 80 per cent.
However, Vauxhall has been forced to implement short-time working at both
its assembly plants this year for the first time since 1982 in response to a
steep fall in demand from continental European markets.
Mr William Ebbert, chairman and managing director, warned market conditions
in Europe were worsening and that there was 'little hope of being as
productive and profitable' in 1993 as last year.
The Luton assembly plant has been working a four-day week with output cut by
about 15 per cent since the beginning of January, and the Ellesmere Port
plant has been forced to implement four-day working since the beginning of
March.
Mr Ebbert forecast an increase of about 7 per cent in the UK new car market
this year to 1.7m but warned that overall west European new car sales could
fall by more than 1m units or about 8 per cent to 12.3m in 1993.
Pre-tax profits rose by 69 per cent to Pounds 223.7m (Pounds 132.6m) on
turnover ahead 16.5 per cent to Pounds 3bn (Pounds 2.57bn). The pre-tax
figure was struck after currency losses of Pounds 18.9m incurred in the wake
of the devaluation of the pound last September and a Pounds 28.8m write-down
on Vauxhall's holding in Avis Europe, the car rental group. Vauxhall holds
the parent company's 26.5 per cent stake in Cilva Holdings, the holding
company for Avis Europe.
However, there were no significant launch costs during the period and
increased materials purchasing in the UK had helped contain costs.
The results were boosted by record vehicle production at both assembly
plants, with output rising by 15 per cent to 301,857. Exports, which only
began in significant volumes in 1990, rose by 8 per cent to 111,700 and
accounted for 37 per cent of output.
New car sales in the UK rose by 7 per cent to 266,072, gaining a record
market share of 16.7 per cent, compared with 15.6 per cent. The improvement
included the success of the new Astra range, which was launched in late
1991.
There was amarginal increase in the overall UK new car market of only 0.1
per cent.
Productivity rose by 8 per cent with the assembly plants, which operated at
full capacity last year, having a cost advantage of more than 15 per cent
against GM's continental European plants and achieving the same quality
levels.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Headline Book Publishing climbed 68 per cent from Pounds
1.22m to Pounds 2.05m in 1992.
Mr Tim Hely-Hutchinson, managing director, said it had been a difficult
year. Sales in 1993 had started better than expected, rising between 1 per
cent and 2 per cent on the previous year.
Operating profits rose to Pounds 2.03m (Pounds 1.24m), including Pounds
354,000 from the Bookpoint acquisition. Group turnover increased 40 per cent
to Pounds 15.7m (Pounds 11.3m), with Bookpoint contributing Pounds 1.7m.
Earnings per share rose 47 per cent to 11.9p (8.1p) and a proposed final
dividend of 3p gives a total of 4.5p (3p).
The figures were prepared under FRS 3. The reported 1991 pre-tax figure was
Pounds 1.3m.

FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Lucas sets up European component joint
ventures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries yesterday moved to strengthen its position in European
automotive components markets by announcing two joint ventures.
The first, with Sagem of France, is designed to expand gasoline engine
management systems sales. Lucas, in addition to technical staff, is putting
its Greenville, South Carolina, plant into the venture, while Sagem is
transferring two French plants to create a company with Pounds 20m of assets
and turnover of Pounds 50m.
Sagem will have management and equity control; Lucas will have a 30 per cent
stake.
The other venture is with Autobrzdy, the Czech brakes company. Initially
Lucas will have a minority stake, but expects to assume majority control
after 1996, by which time it will have invested Pounds 9m in the joint
venture.
Autobrzdy supplies brakes to Skoda, now within the VAG group, which is
Lucas's biggest customer for braking systems. From the Lucas point of view,
the joint venture keeps it close to a customer expanding into a new area.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Slough Estates plans rights issue after 59% rise to Pounds
50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLOUGH Estates, the UK's largest industrial property company, yesterday took
advantage of the City's improved sentiment towards the property sector by
launching a Pounds 147.3m rights issue to reduce its gearing.
The rights issue was accompanied by a 59 per cent rise in 1992 pre-tax
profits from Pounds 31.6m to Pounds 50.3m, a 17 per cent decline in diluted
net assets per share from 331p to 274p and a 30 per cent cut in the
dividend.
Slough Estates' share price, which has nearly doubled since interest rates
began to fall last September, dipped 2p to 193p.
Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman, was cautiously optimistic about the property
market. 'We believe that the market is at or near its bottom,' he said.
However, he doubted that there would be a significant improvement until the
rise in unemployment was arrested.
Sir Nigel said the rights issue was necessary to reduce the 'higher than
appropriate' balance sheet gearing, which increased from 67 per cent to 83
per cent during 1992.
The rights issue will reduce gearing to 58 per cent and dilute the net asset
value from 276p to 245p.
The proposed 3-for-10 rights issues involves the issue of 100.8m new shares
at 150p each. The company also said it was redeeming its 6 per cent
convertible bonds due in 2003.
The operating profit before interest and exceptional items increased from
Pounds 95.7m to Pounds 114.0m. Net interest charges increased from Pounds
27.4m to Pounds 44.9m, with a Pounds 20.2m decline in capitalised interest.
Exceptional provisions against trading property assets amounted to Pounds
18.8m, compared with Pounds 36.7m in 1991. Property sales totalled Pounds
123m.
The value of its investment portfolio fell by 10.1 per cent. Values fell by
7.3 per cent in its core UK industrial portfolio, by 8.2 per cent in its UK
retail portfolio and by 21.1 per cent in its UK office portfolio.
Bredero Properties, which is 49.5 per cent owned by Slough, has began talks
with its banks about renegotiating its loans. Slough has valued its
investment at Pounds 13.3m. Earnings per share rose from 8p to 9.6p. The
final dividend of 5p (up from 7.15p) makes a total dividend for the year of
8.1p (up from 11.55p).

FT  26 MAR 93 / Searching worldwide to cure angst: Management changes at the
top of loss-making UK bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wanted: senior manager of a bank or financial services company who has
achieved sweeping change in established enterprise. To take over a
loss-making UK bank in state of internal angst. Must work well with
recently-appointed management team, none of whom is being considered for the
post.
'I would like to do it as quickly as we can, but it is not going to be that
easy. There are not that many candidates,' says Sir Denys Henderson, the
non-executive director of Barclays who is leading the effort to find a new
chief executive.
If anything, that is an understatement.
The first effect of Barclays' decision to look outside for a new chief
executive to serve under its chairman, Mr Andrew Buxton, emerged yesterday.
A day after it had announced the start of a worldwide search, it disclosed
the resignation of Mr Peter Wood, its well-regarded finance director.
Mr Wood, who earlier this month sat alongside Mr Buxton to explain a Pounds
242m pre-tax loss for 1992, has been talking to Standard Chartered since
January. But the move from Britain's largest bank to a smaller - and
traditionally more troubled - one would hardly be natural under other
circumstances.
Sir Denys says the bank has 'some very competent' people at the top. But the
decision to look outside sends a signal to the heads of Barclays' three
divisions.
These are the huge banking division, which has Pounds 98bn of the bank's
Pounds 149bn assets, the BZW investment bank, and service businesses.
Barclays devised this structure of responsibility in 1991 to balance its
tradition of having a single chairman and chief executive. At the same time,
it appointed Sir Peter Middleton as both deputy chairman of the bank and
chairman of the BZW division to offer advice to Mr Buxton.
Two immediate tasks face the new chief executive. One is to avoid alienating
the other senior executives: Sir Peter, Mr Alastair Robinson of the banking
division, Mr David Band of BZW, and Mr Joseph De Feo of service businesses.
The second is to find a role in the middle of the structure.
Morale in the bank is already stretched. One senior manager says one of his
main tasks is to buoy the spirits of the managers under him. 'We're not
exactly in a battle at the moment because we're not doing any shooting. It's
everyone else who is shooting at us,' he says.
Carving out a role may be just as hard. Mr Buxton says he wants to hand over
'a significant part' of his job. But this risks two strains: one between him
and Sir Peter as he takes on wider overview of policy, and another between
the new chief executive and Mr Robinson.
Then there is Barclays' culture. The bank's creation from family-run
regional banks 96 years ago has given it a tendency to look inwards. Some
investors also believe that because four of its 11 non-executive directors
have served for more than six years the board may not be sufficiently
independent from management.
Sir Denys believes the successful candidate will probably come from a bank
or a financial services company. 'If some genius appears who had done a good
job elsewhere, and could cope with the change of industry, then we would
consider him,' he says.
In the search for someone familiar with the difficulties, it could look to a
direct competitor. When Midland was seeking a successor to Sir Kit McMahon
as chief executive in 1991, it chose Mr Brian Pearse, Barclays' finance
director. Mr Pearse is perceived as having done well at Midland.
Several names are talked about. National Westminster's head of US
operations, Mr John Tugwell, and head of credit risk Mr John Melbourn;
Standard Chartered's chief executive Mr Malcolm Williamson; the TSB Group's
chief executive Mr Peter Ellwood; or Midland's Mr Pearse if he was persuaded
to return.
Appointing someone from a competitor would carry a risk of offending the
remaining senior managers. That might make it tempting to bring in the
senior manager of a large US bank that has already recovered from similar
difficulties with property-related lending.
One American banker argues that a US manager would face two problems coming
to a British bank. One is the difficulty of convincing British managers of
the need for change. 'US banks have been under pressure for longer, and have
driven out more of the old ways of doing business by now,' he says.
The second problem is that Barclays is more diversified than even a US bank
such as Citibank. It has a large securities business in BZW, and a national
branch network. A better fit might be a manager of a Canadian bank with a
national network.
This has not precluded recruitment of several Americans by British banks.
NatWest acquired its chief financial officer, Mr Richard Goeltz, from
Seagram last year, while Midland took on the management consultant Mr Gene
Lockhart in 1987. But to be chief executive of a British bank needs broad
expertise.
The 1980s' fashion for banks recruiting retailers to reform branches and
marketing has been curtailed by renewed emphasis on improving risk
management. All in all, Sir Denys' caution about recruiting an ideal
candidate quickly to soothe the troubles of Barclays appears to be prudent.

FT  26 MAR 93 / CGIP eyes packaging stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CGIP, the French holding company, yesterday confirmed that it is in
negotiations as part of a consortium of investors to acquire a 25.3 per cent
stake in CarnaudMetalbox, the packaging company, from MB-Caradon, the UK
building products group.
MB-Caradon announced last month that it planned to sell its 25.3 per cent
stake in CarnaudMetalbox.
The stake, which dates back to the merger of Metalbox Packaging and Carnaud
in 1989, earns a poor return for MB-Caradon, bringing in a dividend of
Pounds 7.8m in 1991.
CGIP, also a 25.3 per cent shareholder in the packaging company, has rights
of first refusal over the MB-Caradon shares.
The MB-Caradon stake, worth around FFr4.8bn (Pounds 600m) at the current
market price, would be too expensive for CGIP to buy intact, given that the
latter only has FFr700m of cash in its balance sheet.
CGIP is also constrained by a recent ruling by the French stock market
authorities that it must mount a full bid for CarnaudMetalbox if it raised
its current holding by more than 7 per cent.
CGIP said yesterday that it planned to bid for the stake together with 'a
number of other investors'.
It confirmed that those investors included Mr Albert Frere and Mr Paul
Desmarais, two businessmen.
However, CGIP declined to comment on a report that Banque Nationale de Paris
and Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled banks, were also involved in its
bid.
CGIP also refused to verify La Tribune's report that it planned to offer
FFr190 a share, which would value the MB-Caradon stake at FFr3.9bn.
This compares with CarnaudMetalbox's current share price, which closed down
FFr15 at FFr221 yesterday.
CGIP said it was still in negotiations with MB-Caradon and had not yet
finalised its offer.
A number of other companies have already expressed an interest in the stake,
including Pechiney, the French state-controlled aluminium group which is a
major player in packaging.
Pechiney has said it would be prepared to buy shares in CarnaudMetalbox to
prevent a competitor investing in the company.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Redland shares fall on ACT worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS that UK tax charges will rise sharply over the next two years sent
Redland's share price tumbling 4 per cent yesterday despite the announcement
by the British building materials group of a 19 per cent pre-tax profits
rise last year.
The share price of the world's biggest roof tile manufacturer fell 21p to
467p over concern that the company will generate insufficient UK profits
this year and next to offset against advance corporation tax (ACT) payments.
A rise of a third in German earnings from Pounds 85.8m to Pounds 114.5m
helped group pre-tax profits increase to Pounds 221.5m compared with Pounds
186m in 1991.
Earnings per share however fell by 21 per cent from 30p to 23.7p following a
rise of more than a fifth in the tax charge from Pounds 51.1m to Pounds
62.4m and a 62 per cent increase in minorities to Pounds 48.4m mostly
payable to Braas, Redland's 51 per cent owned German subsidiary.
Redland proposes to maintain the final dividend at 16.75p, making a total of
25p, the same as in 1991. The rise in the tax charge is expected to inhibit
the company's ability to raise earnings or dividends, which are likely to
remain at current levels for the next two years.
The tax charge last year would have been Pounds 20m higher but for Redland's
ability to offset ACT against the UK earnings of Steetley, a rival building
materials company acquired last March in a contested bid worth Pounds 613m.
Without the Steetley acquisition, pre-tax profits would only have risen by
an estimated Pounds 4m.
Interest payments, up from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 26.4m, following the
purchase, were nine times covered by operating profits, in spite of a rise
in gearing to 42 per cent.
Mr Robert Napier, managing director, said that Steetley had contributed
Pounds 50m to operating profit. UK profits rose 11 per cent to Pounds 37.9m.
North American profits increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 27.3m while
profits from continental countries other than Germany increased by 89 per
cent to Pounds 53.9m.
Mr Napier said: 'Prospects in the UK, at last, look more encouraging.
Germany continues to trade strongly, the United States is recovering and
sterling's devaluation is benefiting our overseas profits.'

FT  26 MAR 93 / Wellcome shares slide on 14% real rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Wellcome, the UK drugs group, fell 72p to 818p after the company
posted disappointing underlying growth for the first six months.
Pre-tax profits for the half-year to February 27 were at the top end of
expectations, up 33 per cent from a restated Pounds 204.7m to Pounds 324.6m.
However, excluding currencies the increase was 14 per cent. At the time of
the Wellcome share issue last year analysts had been predicting annual
profits growth of about 20 per cent.
Mr John Robb, chief executive, said: 'I think the figures are pretty damned
good given the environment has changed considerably over the last 12 months.
The market's reaction shows how volatile and nervous it is to drugs stocks.'
'These are not easy times, with countries such as Germany, Italy, Spain and,
to a lesser extent, the UK taking extreme measures against the
pharmaceutical industry in an effort to control healthcare costs,' he said.
European prices had declined since the same period last year and sales had
been affected by health reforms in Germany.
Turnover from continuing operations increased 22 per cent from Pounds 839m
to Pounds 1.03bn. Excluding currencies the rise was 11 per cent. For
prescription medicines the increase was 13 per cent, while the
over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription division declined 3 per cent.
Lack of growth in OTC business had partly been caused by 32 per cent growth
the previous year, and partly by the low incidence this winter of coughs and
colds, an area where Wellcome was particularly exposed, said Mr Robb. He
added that competition in the US had been fierce.
Mr Robb said the group was looking to set up a joint venture before the end
of the year in OTC, probably as a junior partner. The intention was to
broaden Wellcome's product base and exploit Zovirax, Wellcome's best-selling
herpes and chickenpox treatment, in the OTC market.
Excluding currencies, sales of Zovirax increased 17 per cent to Pounds 369m.
Underlying revenues from Retrovir, the HIV medicine, increased 14 per cent
to Pounds 131m.
Trading margins improved to 30.5 per cent while spending on research and
development increased 16 per cent to Pounds 153m. Earnings per share
increased 33 per cent to 23.2p. The dividend is 4.8p (4p).

FT  26 MAR 93 / Barclays to lose its finance director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER WOOD, finance director of Barclays, is to leave and join Standard
Chartered, Barclays said yesterday. The announcement came the day after
Barclays said it intended to appoint a chief executive from outside. Mr
Wood, 50, who would have been a contender for chief executive of Barclays if
it had wanted an internal appointment, made no comment on the reason for his
departure. Both banks said he had been talking to Standard since January.
Barclays appointed Mr Oliver Stocken, finance director of its BZW investment
banking division, to succeed Mr Wood from May 1. Mr Andrew Buxton, Barclays'
chairman and chief executive, said the bank was 'sorry to lose' Mr Wood. He
will succeed Mr Richard Stein, who is retiring as a director from June 30.
Mr Rodney Galpin, Standard chairman, welcomed Mr Wood's 'wide and varied
experience in one of the world's leading banking groups'.
Barclays emphasised yesterday that talks about Mr Wood's appointment had
predated its announcement on Wednesday that it would undertake a worldwide
search for someone to take on Mr Buxton's role as chief executive while he
remained chairman. But Mr Wood's approach to Standard came after Mr Buxton
disclosed that he intended to split his two roles, and might seek a chief
executive from outside. Some institutional shareholders had pressed for a
division of the roles.
Barclays' ordinary shares fell 1p down at 414p, and Standard's fell 3p to
710p.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Senate approves budget deficit cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate yesterday handed President Bill Clinton another substantial
political victory when it approved the broad outlines of his plan to cut the
federal budget deficit by Dollars 500bn (Pounds 352bn) over the next five
years.
The critical vote on the Dollars 1,500bn Budget Resolution Bill for fiscal
1994 was 54-45. Only two Democrats broke ranks with the president - Senator
Richard Shelby, a conservative from Alabama, and Senator Bob Krueger of
Texas, an interim senator fighting for full-time election from the state in
May. Another Democrat, Senator Daniel Inouye from Hawaii, was away from
Washington and did not vote.
There are a few minor differences between the Senate bill and that which
passed the House with ease last week. These must be reconciled by a
conference committee of the two chambers. The Senate then moved on to debate
Mr Clinton's Dollars 16bn short-term stimulus plan amid predictions that it
would be harder to keep the Democrats in line.
The passage by both houses of the deficit reduction plan is an indispensable
first step in the budgetary process. Although the hard
programme-by-programme spending cuts and tax-by-tax revenue increases have
yet to be addressed, defeat for the president in the initial stage of the
legislative process would have severely undermined his authority.
His victory shows his political clout and the loyalty of his party. In a TV
interview on Wednesday night, Mr Clinton was confident he would carry the
day. He also argued strongly in favour of the stimulus plan. The public, he
said, would be 'outraged' if the opportunity to create an extra 500,000 new
jobs was passed up.
The Senate, by a 73-24 margin, also gave Mr Clinton the 'line item veto',
which would enable him to overrule individual spending and tax allocations
without sacrificing a whole bill.
Though this was granted only in the form of a non-binding resolution,
without immediate practical effect, it is a test of Senate sentiment on the
issue. Former President George Bush never persuaded the Democratic majority
to grant him the veto.
The Democratic leadership in the Senate has resisted all attempts this week
substantially to change Mr Clinton's proposed package. The toughest
challenge was overcome with the defeat of a Republican amendment to prevent
the administration from increasing taxes on wealthier pensioners.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Post Office sell-off necessary to ensure low prices, chief
says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL COCKBURN, chief executive of the Post Office, yesterday warned that
lack of greater commercial freedom would lead to increased costs and higher
letter prices.
His warning came as he announced that the current price freeze on first and
second class letters, at 24p and 18p respectively, would be extended to the
end of August - two years after the last increase.
For the first time since becoming chief executive last October, Mr Cockburn
indicated that only privatisation would give the Post Office the freedom it
needs to guarantee low costs and low prices.
Privatisation was put back on the political agenda last year when the
Department of Trade and Industry announced a review of the Post Office's
future. It is expected to announce its conclusions in the summer.
Although Mr Cockburn said the future ownership was a matter for the
government, he said that attempts to give the Post Office more commercial
freedom within the public sector were bound to fail. He feared such a move
might turn out to be a 'fudge' or an 'optical illusion'.
Speaking at a conference in London on post office privatisation, Mr Cockburn
said: 'If the Post Office is to maintain its winning edge as the leading
postal operator in the world, it needs to cut loose from the stifling
cash-book culture of the public sector. Privatisation would give us the
freedom we need.'
If the government did decide to privatise the Post Office, Mr Cockburn said
it should keep it as a single entity. 'Chopping up the Post Office into
different bits would make no sense at all.'
Mr Cockburn also criticised the existing financial targets imposed on the
Post Office. His attack was echoed by Mr Tom Corrigan, chairman of the Post
Office Users' National Council, the industry watchdog.
Mr Corrigan called for a strong user voice to be heard independently from a
Post Office regulator to ensure that financial considerations 'will not mean
cuts in postal services or increased prices for the user'.
Mr Cockburn's support for the Post Office's letter monopoly drew an angry
response from Mr Peter Kane, chairman of Business Post.
Although Mr Cockburn indicated that the monopoly on letters costing Pounds 1
and under could be reduced to 50p, Mr Kane described any letter monopoly as
a 'nonsense' and urged the government to scrap it in order to promote
greater competition.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Slough Estates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market's benign response to Slough Estates' Pounds 147m rights issue is
mystifying. Here is a property company with a distinctly patchy investment
record tapping shareholders effectively to help redeem Pounds 181m worth of
convertible bonds. Slough accepts there is precious little evidence of any
improvement in the property market. Indeed rents and asset values are still
falling.
There is some justification for the issue's appeal. Slough's new shares
offer a secure yield of 6.75 per cent, while, further out, the company's
strengthened balance sheet will give it greater headroom to invest and
generate income growth. Slough's heavy weighting in the more resilient
industrial property market gives it better prospects than those exposed to
office property. Its international presence will also help.
Even so, the issue looks more like an opportunistic exercise in balance
sheet repair. The danger is that similarly optimistic arguments may be
trotted out by a string of other property companies. If so, they should also
be treated with suspicion. Dividends may be safe at current levels but for
most companies it will be years before they can justify any increase. The
direct market will remain soggy as it soaks up surplus stock. Property
shares have rebounded strongly from last autumn's slough of despond. Since
September, the sector has outperformed the market by 35 per cent, Slough by
76 per cent. Such movements invite rights issues from any company that can
concoct a half-way convincing story.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK dividends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Something of a rush seems to be developing to pay dividends before the lower
tax credit comes into force on April 5. The dozen or so companies who are
paying the final early in the form of a second interim are, though, engaging
in little more than small beer tax avoidance. More disturbing is the example
set by those like Rentokil and Unilever which are increasing dividends to
compensate tax-free investors for the yield they have lost. Unilever's dual
nationality gives it a particular excuse. Rentokil's increase may be an
isolated act of bravado. Yet institutions are twisting arms behind the
scenes, despite the chancellor's apparent desire to make tax-free investors
pay some of the cost of boosting industry.
UK companies already pay a high proportion of earnings in dividends. One
must not overstate Mr Lamont's objectives, but the aim of improving
corporate cash flow will be lost if the savings from unrelieved ACT are
simply paid out in higher dividends.
The reduced equity yields resulting from the tax changes may imply a fall in
prices. But the market has already shed some 70 points since the Budget.
Companies which give in to pressure to raise their payout when finances are
weak will only have themselves to blame if they are short of working capital
as the recovery gathers pace. Shareholders, too, might then come to regret
their short-term greed.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Redland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Budget changes to ACT were too little, too late for Redland. If the
company could forget about tax it would have a reasonable story to tell.
This year's profits will see the full benefit from devaluation. Germany is
holding up well so far. There is tentative recovery in the UK. Whatever else
happens in France, there is at least the promise of efficiency gains from
rationalising Steetley's aggregates business there. Disposals already in the
bag should help cash-flow, offsetting the lower income on Redland's reduced
level of sterling deposits.
Sadly all this pales into insignificance compared with the tax problem.
Steetley's greatest benefit to Redland to date has probably been the Pounds
20m tax saving it brought last year. But that leaves only Pounds 10m of
surplus ACT left. The tax charge will rise inexorably over the next couple
of years, leaving Redland struggling to cover its dividend. After issuing so
many shares to pay for Steetley, it cannot get round this with a BAT-style
scrip issue. Nor, for the same reason, can it cut its dividend, although it
is arguably paying for over-distribution.
Redland thus looks stuck with a period of flat earnings and a dividend which
would be vulnerable if building materials did get caught up in the German
recession. A yield of 6.7 per cent (on the post-Budget basis) looks
inadequate. With hindsight, peak dividend cover of 2.5 times was too low,
but Redland will take years of restraint to return even to that level.
Competitors like RMC will increase their payouts more rapidly.

FT  26 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Wellcome down to earth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems uncharitable to slice 8 per cent from Wellcome's share price in
response to a 33 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. But having smartly
outperformed Glaxo for the last three months, Wellcome was already
vulnerable. Stripping out currency movements from yesterday's interim
figures shows it to be far from immune from tough market conditions. Volume
growth of its two largest drugs, Zovirax and Retrovir, has slowed markedly.
Drug prices fell in Europe as the German and other governments introduced
stern regulations. There are signs that the steady margin improvement of
recent years may not have much further to go.
Like Glaxo, Wellcome must also plan for the patent expiry of its biggest
selling drug. Zovirax, like Glaxo's Zantac, may find a new lease of life as
an over-the-counter medicine. Since Wellcome already sells cold remedies
through chemists shops and supermarkets, it might be better placed than
Glaxo to manage the transition. But developing an OTC version of Zovirax
will require heavy marketing outlays. That would squeeze Wellcome's margins.
An OTC business based on a small range of products would also be vulnerable
to competition.
The odds on success in OTC medicines will certainly improve if Wellcome can
agree a joint venture with a credible international partner. That might help
justify the price-earnings premium to Glaxo remaining after yesterday's
slide in the shares. But the magic ingredient supporting Wellcome since last
summer's international share offering was not evident from yesterday's
figures. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that either Glaxo has been
over-sold or Wellcome has further to fall.

FT  26 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Properties caution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cash call from Slough Estates was generally well received, chiefly
because the shares were offered at such a large discount to the ongoing
market price. The 3-for-10 rights at 150p will raise Pounds 147.3m which
will be used to cut gearing. News of the rights issue sent the shares into
retreat, tumbling 12 at one stage, before recovering to close just 2 adrift
at 193p. A cautious but generally positive statement helped lift sentiment
in the stock.
Some analysts predicted that the Slough issue would be the first of many in
the property sector. Property shares have been in vogue in recent weeks,
buoyed by talk of recovery and that the sector was at the bottom of the
cycle. Last week, James Capel advised clients to go overweight in property,
a move echoed by a number of other smaller brokers. Property shares have
risen by 8.4 per cent in the past three weeks, against a static performance
by the FT-SE All-Share.
One leading property specialist said: 'With share prices moving so far
ahead, a lot of the leading property groups are thought to be contemplating
rights issues.' Favourites to make a call include British Land, the shares
off 6 at 260p, and Great Portland Estates, down 3 at 164p.

FT  26 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Worries that the pace of earnings growth at Wellcome, one of the UK market's
most highly-rated companies, could be slowing, alarmed the stock market and
drove the shares down by more than 8 per cent.
The growth rate concerns emerged following the post-results meeting with
analysts. Earlier Wellcome reported interim profits up from Pounds 204.7m to
Pounds 324.6m but a slightly disappointing interim dividend.
Pharmaceuticals specialists said there were indications at the analysts'
meeting that the company's long term growth rates could be slowing down. 'If
Wellcome is unable to maintain the high rate of earnings expansion, then the
impact on the price earnings ratio can and will be dramatic,' said a
London-based analyst at one of the leading US investment banks.
And at least one of the top London securities houses was said to have
adopted an aggressively bearish stance on the shares, because of slowing
margin growth, taking the view that the stock price could easily fall below
the 800p mark.
At the day's worst, Wellcome shares fell to 807p, but they later stabilised
to close a net 72 down at 818p. Turnover in the stock expanded rapidly
during the session, reaching 8.7m by the close.

<TEXT>
NEWS THAT PowerGen is to pay a second interim dividend of 7.15p a share,
coupled with widespread relief that the Government's White Paper on the coal
industry brought no regulatory negatives for the power generators, saw the
two English and Welsh generators surge ahead.
PowerGen shares raced up to equal their all-time high of 342p, a net gain of
16, following very heavy turnover of 7.3m shares. Dealers in the utilities
sector said the market had expected PowerGen to bring forward payment of the
dividend from June to March because of the alterations to Advanced
Corporation Tax in the Budget. There was, however, marginal disappointment
with the dividend level proposed.
National Power, expected to follow PowerGen in bringing forward its final
dividend, climbed 12 to 336p after turnover of 6m shares.

FT  26 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Good rally from early bout of selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTOR's confidence was challenged in the UK stock market yesterday by
some discomforting corporate profits statements and by a Pounds 200m selling
programme from a leading securities house. Equities were hard hit in the
first half of the session but staged a successful recovery to regain the
important FT-SE 2,850 support level.
Profits news from Wellcome, the leading anti-aids drug manufacturer, and
from Redland, the construction group, were negative factors, but traders
stressed that, in both cases, it was the meetings with City analysts that
did the damage.
Higher profits at Wellcome failed to save the shares from worries that
future growth rates might be less dependable. At Redland, concern focused on
the preponderence of overseas earnings.
Early firmness in equities melted away as analysts returned from these two
important company meetings and the market reaced strongly to the sell
programme, reportedly from UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew. Stock market confidence had
to meet its first significant test this week without the benefit of any more
of the large share placings which have recently been a feature of equity
trading. There was a Pounds 147.3m rights call from Slough Estates.
Share prices tumbled quickly and trading volume increased as the programme
struck home. By mid-session, the FT-SE Index had lost 27.2 points to 2,833.4
and traders were looking uncomfortably towards 2,800 which some have
suggested could be the next base mark.
However, a good recovery set in later as Wall Street opened higher and the
UK power generating stocks brightened after the Government White Paper
appeared to leave their regulatory position unchanged.
At the close of business, the reading of 2,852.8 on the FT-SE Index showed
the day's fall reduced to 7.8. Some 4.6 points reflected falls in Wellcome
and Redland shares.
Traders expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the session. While some
sizeable lines of stock had come on offer, buyers had come forward.
Seaq volume increased by more than 8 per cent over Wednesday's total to
904.3m shares, of which around 63 per cent was in non-Footsie stocks; the
total included 128m shares in Ticketing, one of the market's lesser-known
stocks.
Retail, or customer, business rebounded sharply in the previous session to
record value of Pounds 1.69bn, although this figure was swollen by the heavy
share placing in George Wimpey.
The heaviest losses yesterday came in those sectors which have most
noticeably outperformed the rest of the market since the turn of the year.
Properties, where the Slough Estates rights issue could be the first of
many, ran into the sellers. But the heaviest losses came in the merchant
banks which have been benefiting from excellent profits statements from some
leading names.
The FT-SE Index has now lost the gains achieved in the run-up to the UK
Budget on March 16. But selling has been moderate and comfortably absorbed
in the market. Nor has the flow of rights issues upset share prices to date.
However, most strategists agree that share prices will remain vulnerable
until there is further indication that the UK economy is securely on the
recovery trail.

FT  26 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures maintained a healthy premium to the underlying cash
market throughout the day in spite of a sharp retreat brought about by a
sell programme in the first half of the session, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened at 2,867, the March contract moved sharply ahead to 2,875 on
news that the Bundesbank had cut its interest rate on its 3-day Treasury
bills to 7.5 per cent.
That momentum quickly faded as dealers instead focused on the big sell
programme, said to have come from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. This led to
persistent selling of the contract and the June contract recorded a low of
2,840 for the day.
The firm opening in New York, together with sizeable buying from a leading
US house helped the June contract to recover.
There was a 10-20 point premiumfor most of the day and the June contract
closed at 2,870, 3 points below its close on Wednesday and 13 points above
its estimated fair value to cash of around 9 points. Turnover was around
10,000 contracts.
Dealings in traded options were quite heavy and volume closed at 41,576
lots. Some 6,348 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,059 in
the Euro FT-SE 100 option. Among the stock options, Dixons led the way with
2,136 contracts and was followed by Prudential at 1,981 lots.

Wall Street
SIGNS OF reduced tensions in Russia and a revival in drugs stocks helped
Wall Street post gains through the day, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 15.94 higher at 3,461.32 after being
lifted to near-record levels on program-buying in the afternoon. The more
broadly based Stan dard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 2.67 to 450.64, while the Amex
composite gained 0.84 at 419.12, and the Nasdaq composite firmed 6.65 at
681.01. Trading volume on the NYSE was some 251m shares and rises
outnumbered declines by 1,129 to 736.
On Thursday, the Dow fell 16.48 to 3,445.38.
Equities were helped by a recovery in drug stocks, which fell on Wednesday
following Merck's disappointing earnings forecast. Merck firmed Dollars  3/4
to Dollars 35 1/2 , Pfizer added Dollars 2 to Dollars 59 5/8 and Abbott
Laboratories rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 24 1/4 . Bristol-Myers Squibb,
however, eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 57 1/2 .
Market sentiment also benefited from signs that tensions are easing in
Russia after Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, a rival of President Boris Yeltsin, said
that he opposed the impeach ment of the latter.
In the oil sector, Getty Petro- leum soared Dollars 2 to Dollars 12 1/8 as
it reported fourth quarter net income of 54 cents a share, up from 26 cents
a year earlier. Among the other energy stocks, Exxon gained Dollars  1/2 at
Dollars 65 5/8 and Mobil advanced Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 69 5/8 but Chevron
slid Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 81.
International Business Machines share price continued to as the stock was
hit by worries about the sector on Wednesday after Amdahl pre dicted a bad
first quarter. Investors were also uneasy on reports that Mr Louis Gertsner,
chairman of RJR Nabisco, would soon be named head of IBM. IBM was Dollars
5/8 lower at Dollars 50 1/2 but Amdahl held steady at Dollars 6 1/2 . Other
computer issues revived after Wednesday's declines including Digital
Equipment up Dollars 3 to Dollars 45 1/8 and Hewlett-Packard Dollars 1 3/4
higher at Dollars 74 1/2 .
Amongst big stocks actively traded were Philip Morris, down Dollars 1 to
Dollars 61 1/2 and General Motors Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 38 1/2 .
Campbell Soup rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 43 3/4 after it increased its
quar terly dividend to 25 cents a share from 22 cents.
Technology and healthcare issues dominated Nasdaq morning trading. Oracle
System firmed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 , Amgen added Dollars  1/8 at
Dollars 34 7/8 and US Healthcare improved Dollars 1 to Dollars 41 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO prices ended higher in active trading with the TSE-300 composite
index - based on preliminary data - up 8.34 points, or 0.23 per cent, to
3,612.04, with advances leading declines 374 to 268. Today's volume of
57.18m shares included a block of 725,140 shares of the publisher Thomson.
Mitel Corp. shares surged CDollars 0.23 to CDollars 2.85 but the company
said that it did not know of any reason for the activity.
International Epitek soared CDollars 1.05 to CDollars 3.00.

FT  26 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Chirac's views help Paris to
2.4% gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EASING of political tension in Russia helped to improve sentiment
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was excited by a number of external factors on the first day of the
new account and, assisted by futures buying, the CAC-40 index regained the
2,000 level for the first time in two weeks. The index closed up 46.79, or
2.4 per cent, at 2,001.36 in turnover estimated at FFr3bn.
Comments by Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullist RPR party, which
polled the most votes in last Sunday's election, stressing that economic
growth was essential for the country was interpreted by some investors as
opening the way for an easing in the franc fort policy and lower interest
rates.
Carnaud Metalbox, down FFr15 or, 6 per cent, at FFr221, continued to draw
interest as CGIP, one of the major shareholders, was reported to be
discussing the purchase of MB-Caradon's 25 per cent stake at FFr190 a share.
CGIP fell FFr20 to FFr1,148 while Pechiney International, which at one stage
had been rumoured to have been interested in buying a stake, rose FFr8 to
FFr223.
LVMH gained FFr78 to FFr3,625 as a number of brokers lifted their
recommendations on the stock.
FRANKFURT had a good start, encouraged by Chancellor Kohl's reaffirmation
that the solidarity pact is the right package to get the economy on the
growth track again, and his pressure on G7 countries to support the Russian
president, Mr Boris Yeltsin.
The DAX index hit an intraday high of 1,671.89, up 12.44. However, immediate
and domestic issues took over, with a March inflation rate of 4.3 per cent
in two German states slightly above the February level; with higher postal
services costs coming up, inflation is thought unlikely to fall below 4 per
cent in the first half of this year.
The DAX index ended 2.30 lower at 1,657.15 as turnover eased from DM7bn to
DM6.9bn. Daimler and Volkswagen continued to post gains, DM10.50 to DM616
and DM2.40 to DM305.80 on the disclosure of hidden reserves, and top
management moves respectively; and while some analysts said that this was
only a trading move, both shares picked up in the post bourse, to around
DM620, and DM308.
ZURICH was enlivened by corporate results but, overall, the market continued
its slow consolidation. The SMI index lost 9.3 to 2,137.5.
Sandoz bearers picked up from an early SFr50 decline to finish SFr10 ahead
at SFr2,980 as the group lifted net profit to SFr1.5bn and announced a
higher-than-expected 34 per cent rise in dividend.
Mr Eric Bernhardt of Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich noted that the
profits gain attributable to the company's switch to the International
Accounting Standards, at 50 per cent, was lower than expected. 'The fact
that half of the rise came from higher operating margins is very positive.'
However, he was revising down earnings estimates for this year and next by
5-6 per cent because of the uncertain outlook for pharmaceuticals sales in
the US and Germany.
Swissair bearers rose SFr7 to SFr580 as analysts noted a halved dividend,
and attributed a much higher than expected group net profit for 1992 to
extraordinary items. One added: 'These figures do not tell us anything about
how the group will perform in 1993.'
AMSTERDAM had to wait until after the close for VNU, the publishing group,
to report a 59 per cent fall in 1992 net profits as it made a large
provision for its printing division. The shares were 70 cents lower at Fl
101 as the CBS Tendency index slipped 0.1 to 105.8.
STOCKHOLM was supported by further interest in Ericsson which accounted for
some 50 per cent of total turnover of SKr953m. The Affarsvarlden general
index rose 3.9 to 986.2.
Ericsson B advanced SKr13 or 5.3 per cent to SKr260, a year's high,
encouraged by strong order books for the first quarter of 1993.
DUBLIN was not overly impressed by the overnight bids for the government's
Greencore stake, but the impetus from interest rate expectations continued
and the ISEQ overall index recovered another 16.08 to 1,457.29.
COPENHAGEN again concentrated on the slide in Baltica Holding, down DKr19.79
or 25.7 per cent to DKr57.00. The KFX index closed 0.27 lower at 78.78 in
turnover of DKr403m. Den Danske Bank, which has a 32 per cent stake in
Baltica, regained DKr5 to DKr315.

dollar brings out investors

<TEXT>
A WEAKER yen encouraged sentiment, and share prices rose on active trading
as index-linked buying by arbitrageurs prompted purchases by institutional
and individual investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 314.23 at 18,764.92. The index opened at the
day's low of 18,471.96, and hit a high of 18,877.50 in the morning session.
Share prices eased in the afternoon on profit-taking.
Volume rose from 356m shares to 470m. Advances overwhelmed declines by 785
to 258, with 127 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 18.59 to 1,414.02 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 7.12
to 1,129.91.
The dollar firmed Y1.22 against the yen, closing at Y117.15. US economic
figures announced overnight encouraged hopes of a strengthening American
economy, and the currency closed above Y117 for the first time in seven
trading days.
Reports that a leading US securities house was advising investors to
increase allocation to Japanese stocks also encouraged buying by
institutional investors.
Yesterday's gains were led by a rise in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone,
which closed up 18,000 to Y828,000 in active trading. Telecommunications
related issues were also strong, with Fujikura up Y82 to Y760 and Furukawa
Electric gaining Y100 to Y607.
High-technology exporters were higher on the lower yen. Fujitsu gained Y35
to Y640 and NEC, the most active issue of the day, gained Y63 to Y835.
Some investors bought cheap large capital stocks to lock in dividends, paid
at the end of the financial year. Nippon Steel rose Y8 to Y335, and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rose Y14 to Y564.
The forthcoming listing of JR East, expected in the third quarter of this
year, buoyed railway-related issues. Keisei Electric Railway rose Y10 to
Y1,090 and Tokyu Car, a rolling stock maker, Y10 to Y570.
Foreign buying lifted Nomura Securities, which firmed Y80 to Y1,880. Other
brokers were also strong with Nikko Securities up Y23 to Y850 and Daiwa
Securities advancing Y20 to Y1,060.
Food shares were lower on profit-taking. Ajinomoto fell Y10 to Y1,250 and
Kirin Brewery fell Y10 to Y1,160.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 218.59 to 19,659.09 in volume of 124.4m
shares. Export-oriented issues were higher on the lower yen.
Roundup
AN absence of fresh incentives and holidays in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur made
for a quiet day on the Pacific Rim.
HONG KONG was firmer but off the day's highs as profit-taking emerged when
the Hang Seng index briefly topped the 6,300 level. At the close, the index
was 34.78 ahead at 6,246.97 as turnover climbed to HKDollars 3.7bn.
Property stocks, the star performers of the previous two days on hopes of a
higher mortgage ceiling, saw strong profit-taking but most shares still
finished higher. Sun Hung Kai Properties closed up 50 cents at HKDollars
32.50 after touching HKDollars 32.75 and Hysan rose 20 cents to HKDollars
14.10.
Jardine Matheson rose 50 cents to HKDollars 47.25 after better than expected
1992 profits.
AUSTRALIAN stocks edged down with the All Ordinaries index shedding 2.4 to
1,660.7 in weak turnover of ADollars 260.1m.
However, the gold marker rose 16.3 to 1,140.0, aided by uncertainty over the
outlook in Russia.
In the banking sector, Westpac fell 4 cents to ADollars 2.98 in volume of
4.6m shares amid speculation about further property write-downs, involving
as much as ADollars 900m.
NEW ZEALAND was unperturbed by a cabinet reshuffle and shares were firmer
with the NZSE-40 index 6.76 ahead at 1,560.01.
Fletcher Challenge, which cleared the way for the sale of its methanol
operations, gained 5 cents to NZDollars 2.45.
TAIWAN was mixed after late profit-taking cut early gains and the weighted
index, which rose more than 50 points at one stage, ended 2.0 lower at
4,652.68 in turnover of TDollars 51.2bn. Formosa Plastics added TDollars
2.50 to TDollars 45.10 on reports that it would soon start building its
long-delayed naphtha cracker plant.

FT  26 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Strong advances in Turkey and Taiwan -
The performances of the world's emerging markets in February
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST in emerging markets shifted away from Latin America in February,
with the best performances coming from Turkey and Taiwan. However, Brazil
still celebrated its carnival month, comfortably leading its own region.
Taiwan reacted favourably to the resignation of the prime minister, Hau Pei
Tsun, and his replacement by Lien Chan, the first native born person to hold
the post. Mr Peter Nankervis, of HG Asia in London, comments that the market
has been the fastest growing in the region, with a 22 per cent rise in the
weighted index in February continuing through to March when it reached an
11-month high. The rally was also accompanied by very high turnover.
Turkey was top performer among emerging markets this year according to data
supplied by the IFC, part of the World Bank. It began to lift itself out of
the doldrums at the end of December. Mr Kaya Didman of Baring Securities
observes that the market had been looking oversold, given a fall of 52 per
cent in dollar terms in 1992.
Technical factors accompanied the new mood of optimism as the government cut
short-term interest rates, thereby triggering a demand for equities.
Mr Didman believes that while the market has recently entered a period of
consolidation the outlook for the rest of the year remains favourable, given
the forecast of strong corporate earnings growth.
Brazil has been fortified by efforts by the new government of President
Itamar Franco to press ahead with economic reforms. However, as Ms Else
Derrick of Latin American Securities comments, the market's recent rally has
followed precedent: in the past a rise has always preceded the announcement
of a new economic programme.
With Mr Franco likely to publish details of this programme before the April
21 plebiscite on constitutional change, Ms Derrick expects the market's
strength to continue for another few weeks.
So far, Venezuela leads this year's laggards. First Boston, in a recent
strategy document, notes that the market has been volatile pending
December's presidential elections. 'Given slower economic growth and higher
inflation, export-orientated companies may be the best alternative in a
difficult market,' it says.
The IFC has launched a new set of stock indices to monitor emerging markets.
The new indices will differ from existing local ones by taking into account
restrictions on foreign investment. Foreigners are often legally prevented
from investing in ways that locals are not, said Mr Daniel Adams, IFC
vice-president. IFC will compile the indices from its database of more than
1,000 stocks in developing countries.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Money Markets: More bullish mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was a more bullish mood about German interest rate cuts in European
cash and futures markets yesterday after the Bundesbank reduced the interest
rate on its 3-day Treasury bills, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank brought down the rate on these bills by 90 basis points to
7.5 per cent. Some dealers were very surprised by the extent of the move,
and saw it as another clear example that the German authorities were
prepared to ease policy aggressively.
According to Mr Jonathan Hoffman, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston
in London, the international market does not tend to focus on the T-Bill
rate because of the predominance of the discount and Lombard rates. However,
he says that the 3-day T-Bill rate can form the effective floor for call
money - or the overnight rate of lending - because the Bundesbank uses the
bills to mop up excess liquidity in the money system.
Mr Hoffman believes that commercial banks may have been unwilling to bring
German call money lower in recent days because they could borrow T-bills
from the Bundesbank at 8.40 per cent.
Others, however, saw the change in the Treasury bill rate as a technical
move which did little more than bring these instruments into line with the
recently-reduced Discount rate. One analyst said the 3-day German Treasury
Bill market provided only a limited amount of D-Mark liquidity, in any case.
In any event, the move had a positive effect on rates in the German cash
market. Call money came down to 8.45 per cent from 8.52 per cent on
Wednesday night. However, 3-month money was more or less unchanged at about
7.91 per cent.
The move had a positive effect on short-dated Euromark futures. The June
contract was at one stage 10 basis points above its previous closing level,
at 92.95, although it later fell back to close at 92.93. At this level, the
market is looking for 84 basis points off 3-month money by June.
Rates in the sterling market were unchanged. Three-month money closed at 6
1/16 per cent. The June short sterling contract was squeezed up to 94.20
following the Germen Treasury Bill move but later fell back to 94.15. A
small shortage of Pounds 500m forecast by the Bank of England was easily
removed.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar/D-Mark checks decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR perked up against the D-Mark yesterday, rising more than a
pfennig in late European trading, as dealers kept their attention fixed on
the fluid political situation in Russia, writes James Blitz.
For most of this week, the D-Mark had been pushing the dollar downwards,
with the US currency trading on Wednesday below DM1.63. Some dealers have
even wondered whether a break below DM1.60 was possible this week.
But the dollar managed to check the trend yesterday, closing in London at
DM1.6420, up nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day.
The dollar's rise may have been partly due to signs that the political
crisis in Moscow was easing off. This may seem an ironic claim, because the
US currency has tended to perform well at times of international crisis when
it is seen as a safe haven for investors.
However, although the D-Mark has itself come under some pressure in Europe
because of events in the former Soviet Union, the dollar/D-Mark rate has
slid this week. One factor weighing the US currency down may be fears that
political instability in Russia would threaten President Bill Clinton's
peace dividend and his attempts to reduce the US budget deficit.
Yesterday's decision by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker of the Russian
parliament, not to seek the impeachment of President Yeltsin, may therefore
have boosted the US currency. Profit-taking following the dollar's fall may
also have been a factor helping the dollar up.
Another cause for the D-Mark to weaken yesterday was the Bundesbank's
decision to cut the interest rate on its 3-day Treasury bill by 90 basis
points to 7.5 per cent.
Some dealers described the move as a significant easing of Bundesbank policy
because the Treasury bill rate is sometimes seen as marking the effective
floor for all German cash market rates.
The move underpinned the French franc against the D-Mark inside the European
exchange rate mechanism. The French currency closed at FFr3.3990 from a
previous FFr3.401. Sterling also performed more strongly, closing up  1/2 a
pfennig at DM2.4200.
Despite the Treasury bill move, the Portuguese escudo slipped sharply
against the D-Mark yesterday, prompting currency intervention from the Bank
of Portugal.
A recent disagreement between the Portuguese central bank and the finance
ministry over economic policy continued to hang over the currency. The
escudo closed at Es92.72 from a previous Es92.93 on Wednesday night.
Another currency to remain weak against the D-Mark was the Italian lira,
which closed in London barely changed on the day at L976.4. One analyst said
that rumours in the market that Moody's rating agency was about to downgrade
Italy's sovereign debt was a factor keeping the lira weak.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (8): Golden fibre in trouble - Jute
growers face dual pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REAZUDDIN AHMED
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE jute industry, once Bangladesh's biggest export earner, is today its
greatest agricultural liability.
Annual losses run to more than Dollars 80m and bad debts total Dollars 925m.
Shoddy management, overmanning, competition from synthetics, and a sharp
fall in jute prices over the past decade have all contributed to the
downfall of the 'golden fibre'.
Under a World Bank-led programme, the government is trying to reform the
industry ahead of its eventual privatisation. It envisages large-sale jobs
losses, modernising plant and improving competitiveness.
But since its announcement two years ago, the privatisation programme has
consistently encountered problems in implementation: from a civil service
wary of the thrust of the policy to unions fearing jobs losses.
Earlier this month, jute unions took part in a (largely unsuccessful)
two-day hartal - general strike - in support of a minimum wage. The industry
employs a fifth of the country's workforce and earns 29 per cent of its
foreign currency - down from 80 per cent at its peak in the late 1970s.
The World Bank has warned that further wage increases would erode
competitiveness and impede reform. The Bank is expected to announce a
financing packing for reform of the sector soon, but as Mr Saifur Rahman,
finance minister, says: 'The Bank may not participate in restructuring if
there are further wages increases.'
Some 10,000 jute workers have already accepted redundancy, but another
20,000 need to go together with a larger number of mill closures before the
sector is ripe for sell-off, the government says.
Mr Hannan Shah, jute minister, blames the industry's losses on old machinery
and higher overhead costs. But, as independent observers say, these problems
pale besides the sector's huge bad debts, the biggest single headace facing
the government in overhauling the industry.
Bangladesh accounts for 80 per cent of world exports of raw jute, a fibre
used in many jute-based products such as hessian, carpet-backing cloth and
sacking, and for 40-45 per cent of jute manufacturing.
Jute acreage has been declining over the years, mainly in response to a
downward trend in international prices: an average 780,000 ha were planted
to jute in the early 1970s, falling to 588,260 ha in 1991-92.
Slight yield improvements have not been enough to make up for the fall in
area under cultivation and in general jute output has continued to decline.
In 1990-91, the jute crop was 942,700 tonnes from 584,000 ha, while in
1991-92 an estimated 937,600 tonnes was produced. Bangladesh's jute fibre
exports have fallen sharply, from 500,000 tonnes in the early 1980s to
288,000 tonnes in 1990-91, though they have picked up a little.
After rising steadily in the 1970s and 1980s, world jute demand rose last
year by just 0.7 per cent, says the Dhaka-based International Jute
Organisation, which represents producers.
The IJO says that with jute acreage contracting in leading producer
countries such as Bangladesh and India, world output this year will total
2.9m tonnes, 15 per cent down on last year.
Prospects for the industry are under a cloud: competition from synthetics
and containerisation have dented demand for jute as a packaging material.
Mr Shah believes crop quality must be improved so as to diversify into other
jute-based products, such as paper and textiles. His ministry is studying
two proposals from China and one from Japan to establish a jute-based paper
and pulp industry in Bangladesh.
The rise in environmental concern has also taken its toll on demand; as a
result of a European Commission directive promoting recyclable forms of
packaging, jute consumption in western Europe is expected to fall.
The IJO is pressing EC countries to implement the directive in a way which
recognises jute's environmental qualities. One of the main arguments for
boosting use of jute-based paper, for instance, is that it will reduce the
number of trees chopped down to supply conventional paper mills.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (7): Survival on the seashore - Shiraz
Sidhva finds faith and fatalism in the wake of disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO years after the great cyclone, Ahmed Kabir is still picking up the
pieces.
The cyclone hit Bangladesh on April 29 and 30, 1991. Ahmed's little mud hut,
four miles from the sea, was one of nearly 50,000 homes in this region alone
which were washed away.
Across the country, 140,000 people were killed and millions made homeless.
Ahmed lost more than a dozen close relatives. Apart from losing its home,
his family lost all its livestock including four goats and six buffalos.
The sea, from where the lethal typhoons swept ashore, is also the source of
Ahmed's livelihood - he works on the salt pans and cultivates shrimps.
Ahmed and his wife Nafisa Khatun spent the first days after the cyclone at a
relief centre 25 miles away in Cox's Bazar. They then went back to their
village and rebuilt their home in three months.
Ahmed is one of about 10,000 fishermen who catch shrimp larvae, which they
sell for Taka10 per 100. Since the fishermen have almost no assets, they
cannot borrow from the banks and the cyclone left them in even deeper
poverty than before.
Sayyat Noor, one of Ahmed's neighbours, says 'the aid agencies helped by
giving us money to rebuild our houses and buy fishing nets, but only 10
farmers in 100 were lucky enough to benefit'.
Knee-deep in salt in the blazing heat, Sayyat says his family lived for days
on the rice, salt and chilli powder that they had kept buried in earthen
containers outside their home. These are the 'iron rations' which people in
this part of Bangladesh store away in case of natural disasters.
'If we got saved that day, and if we are able to feed ourselves today, it is
only because of Allah,' says Noor.
About 30,000 families depend on salt reclaiming in Bangladesh and the
cyclone destroyed more than 30 per cent of the salt pans and washed away
more than 200,000 tons of uncrushed black salt. Two ruined salt works still
bear witness to the devastation, although another, less than a mile from the
worst hit area, has been rebuilt and is thriving.
Large fishing boats are used to transport the salt to Chittagong. The
plant's owner, Hafeez, says 1992 was a very good year, thanks to the good
weather which enabled the salt panning season to last from November to May
instead of the usual mid-December to early April.
Abdul Karem, like two thirds of those who work the salt pans, is landless,
and has to lease the land on which the salt is deposited. Borrowing from the
moneylender who also owns the salt pans, many farmers end up as bonded
labourers and their families go ever deeper into debt from one generation to
the next.
The money lender-landlord also buys back the harvested salt at prices as low
as his interest rates are high. 'The cyclone has only increased our debt to
the landlords,' says Kasem. 'For those who did not survive, at least the
misery of surviving each day has ended.'
In summer, the flooded salt flats are used for harvesting shrimps. The
methods used to trap shrimp fry are primitive and uneconomical. According to
an expert, even semi-intensive methods would yield 1,130kg of shrimps per
acre compared with the present 60 kgs. The greater salinity caused by the
cyclone and by last year's long dry summer further reduced the shrimp
harvest.
But nature has not been not entirely cruel to the people of Chakoria. The
emerald-green paddy fields that fringe the salt and shrimp flats benefited
from the wrath of the cyclone. Nearly 80 per cent of all agricultural crops
were destroyed, and the watermelons and tomatos for which the area is
renowned were damaged by the increased salinity.
But the rice crop was 50 per cent bigger than usual thanks to the rich
layers of alluvial soil which the cyclone deposited in the paddy fields.
Aid organisations are slowly helping people to rebuild their homes, even
though this will seriously deplete the amount of bamboo in the nearby
forests.
More than 90 per cent of all livestock (1.4m animals in Chakoria alone) were
killed, together with all the poultry. Only a few buffalos survived. Thanks
to the diligent husbandry of the women, the poultry stock is now back at
more than 30 per cent of its original numbers.
'It killed me to save the eggs for hatching when my children were starving,'
says Farida Khatun. After the disaster she bought a single hen from the
market with money she had saved without telling her husband. She now has 300
birds.
'We have to think ahead, and I knew that a few days more of hunger would
afford us comparative comfort later.'
For Ahmed Kabir, however, recovery is only relative. 'We were poor to begin
with; the cyclone has only made us poorer,' he says. His children had
attended one of the 33,000 primary schools destroyed by the cyclone. Today,
classes are still held out of doors.
Roads have been largely rebuilt and the government is constructing
multi-purpose cyclone shelters with financial help from Saudi Arabia.
Standing on a rebuilt anti-flood embankment (52 per cent of these structures
were destroyed), Ahmed voices the local fatalism. 'No embankment or shelter
can save us, if Allah wishes otherwise,' he says. 'Sometimes, when I work to
rebuild all I have lost, I can't help wondering how soon it will all be
washed away again.'

FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (4): The people can only take so much -
The economy is improving but the international paymasters remain
dissatisfied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KHOZEM MERCHANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECADE ago Bangladesh was in trouble with its international creditors for
failing to meet economic targets. Last year it exceeded most targets, but
this was still not good enough.
The painful reality is that more still needs to be done before the invisible
hands guiding the economy - the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank - can be withdrawn.
'I am in a predicament,' says Mr Saifur Rahman, the finance minister who is
credited by donors and the multilateral lending agencies with having
achieved success so far. 'How far can I go in attaining the targets without
threatening our fragile democracy?'
Surgery is being applied at two levels to the heavily-regulated economy.
Under its agreement with the IMF, Bangladesh is seeking to liberalise trade,
overhaul the tax and tariff regime and improve the balance of payments.
Mr Saifur has met all the targets laid down by the IMF: inflation is 5.0 per
cent, down from 7.2 in the previous year; money supply growth has been
contained to less than 14 per cent, largely as a result of low demand for
loans in the private sector; government expenditure has been curbed; the
current account deficit is down and foreign reserves are at a record high of
Dollars 2bn, though a large component of this is money from donors waiting
to be spent.
Second, a World Bank reform package aims to improve the domestic competitive
environment. This should be achieved by privatising state-owned industries.
Most state industries are uncompetitive, have massive excess capacity, are
over-manned and burdened with bad debt.
The jute sector, fattened by years of easy credit, crippled by plummeting
world jute prices in the 1980s and now burdened with bad debts of Dollars
925m, presents the government with its most formidable challenge.
Under the IMF's macro-programme the biggest success has been tax collection,
which has risen by 10 per cent net of inflation well ahead of target. The
finance minister's doggedness in achieving this has provoked criticism from
a powerful business lobby in parliament (59 per cent of MPs are
businessmen).
Better tax mobilisation has enabled the government to increase its
contribution to the annual development programme, which covers capital
projects and is largely financed by aid.
In 1989, the programme was wholly funded by donors. This year the government
is aiming for a 27 per cent contribution, rising to 30 per cent in 1993-94.
Higher tax revenues and tighter curbs on spending - high wage demands
notwithstanding - have also enabled Mr Rahman to cut the fiscal deficit from
8 per cent of GDP in 1989-90 to 5 per cent last year.
The big issue facing the finance minister in his next budget is how to
sustain the revenue drive while containing spending, mostly salaries. But
the World Bank reform programme will prove the greater test. Privatisation
forms the core of the package.
'Our government is committed to this programme. We must reform sectors,
improve management, withdraw obsolete equipment and make them competitive.
But this will take time,' says Mr Rahman.
Many believe it is taking too long. Two years ago 42 companies were
nominated by the government for privatisation but none of these plans has
advanced.
'Privatisation should have been a clear signal to the private sector that
the government means business. But they have made a mess of it by trying to
sell the least attractive (jute) first and the best last,' says an
economist.
Three main problems confront Mr Rahman in making his privatisation package
stick:
the realisation that the jute, sugar processing, textile and other
industries operated in what a senior World Bank official describes as an
'unparalleled debt culture'. These debts would almost certainly have to be
written off as part of any restructuring.
resistance from organised labour which fears massive job losses.
and the bureaucrats charged with implementing the programme have strong
vested interests in stopping it.
It is the size of the bad debts in the jute industry - mostly to
nationalised commercial banks - which is worrying the authorities. Failure
to resolve this issue could torpedo banking sector reform, now at an
advanced stage. The World Bank is expected to announce a funding plan to
carry out jute reforms by the summer. 'Then the pain will begin,' said a
local banker. Other sectors also carry large non-performing debt.
Unions, though not numerically significant within the total workforce of
50m, continue to exert a powerful disruptive effect. Hartals - or general
strikes - have a crippling effect on the economy. A local employers' group
estimates the cost of a one-day hartal at Dollars 11m in lost production and
distribution.
Last week Skop, an umbrella organisation of labour groups covering textiles,
jute, railway and others, staged a two-day hartal to demand a minimum wage
and the implementation of a wages commission recommendation.
The World Bank publicly denounced Skop's demands as unjustifiable. The
finance minister accused them of 'economic terrorism'.
Finally, the bureaucracy, which is charged with enforcing this state
sell-off is widely seen as incompetent and corrupt and a significant drag on
any implementation.
'There have to be more sacrifices from these interest groups: labour, civil
servants and all the sick industries which for years have been supported by
protectionism and subsidies. Things have got to change,' says a local
commentator.
Privatisation's only real success story has been in agriculture, which
represents 38 per cent of GDP.
It has improved in terms of output and efficiency following the withdrawal
of fertiliser subsidies, the introduction of shallow and tube wells, better
irrigation and the decision to privatise the distribution of fertiliser. And
for the past three years there has been a bumper crop.
An increasing concern for government is aid disbursement. Donors have always
doubted Bangladesh's capacity to absorb aid and use it effectively, largely
because of an inept civil service. Implementation has always been slow.
Today, some Dollars 5.5bn is jammed in the aid pipeline.
The other aspect of this backlog is that if aid money is not disbursed it
creates the wrong investment climate for the private sector. 'The government
must speed up implementation and spend. It must lead by example,' says a
western banker. Private investment in Bangladesh - at 10 per cent of GDP -
is one of the lowest in the region.
Increased private investment will be an important component of the
export-led growth - garments being the best example so far - that the
government believes is the only way forward.
'Import-substitution is no good if the products we produce are
uncompetitive,' says Mr Rahman. 'We need export-led growth. There is no
other way industry (currently just 16 per cent of GDP) can succeed,' he
says.
Last year, the economy grew by 3.8 per cent, ahead of the population growth
of 2.4 per cent; the government needs minimum economic growth of 5.5 per
cent if it is to make a real dent in poverty and sustain the successes of
the past 18 months.
It is this follow-through which is now causing problems. According to one
economist: 'The government is hitting the ball but it isn't going over the
net.'

FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (6): Investors' two-way traffic - While
some foreign companies move in, others call it a day
</HEADLINE>

THE general investment climate has improved over the past 18 months. Foreign
companies are permitted to be 100 per cent owners of local subsidiaries, and
import tariffs and corporation tax have been cut.
However, the record is mixed. While some foreign companies have been
expanding their operations in Bangladesh, others, especially drug companies,
have been leaving.
Among the exodus are Philips, the Anglo-Dutch consumer electronics group,
and NCR, the US computer company. Drug companies, including Imperial
Chemical Industries and Fisons of the UK and Pfizer and Squibb of the US,
have pulled out partly because of a government policy banning the
manufacture of some 1,700 generic drugs by multinationals leaving the market
free for local companies.
Squibb, having decided to sell out to local interests, finally shut its
operations after 25 years in Bangladesh, apparently frustrated at the
bureaucracy surrounding the sale.
Pfizer, which has been trading in Bangladesh since 1955, employs 550 people
with sales of Dollars 7m in 1990. 'The government does not seem to be
concerned,' says Mr Syed Kabir, Pfizer's managing director.
However, other companies are more encouraged. One move which has produced
immediate benefits for foreign companies has been the relaxation on rules
governing technical agreements. Previously foreign companies were not
allowed to pay for technology transfer with foreign currency.
This shift has produced tangible improvements at Bangladesh Tobacco company,
part of UK tobacco group BAT.
'Product development is simply not possible here. That's why these relaxed
conditions on technical exchanges are so vital. It has enabled us to benefit
from the results of leaf research at head office in the UK, invite marketing
expertise over and improve the factory,' says Mr Malcolm Fry, BTC's managing
director. Lever Brothers, a Unilever subsidiary with a Pounds 25m turnover
in toiletries, is also optimistic. It is looking to snap up the interests of
one departing drugs company.
'We see no reason for panic because the government is introducing a degree
of reality,' says Mr Ian Sangster, chairman. Nestle, the Swiss chocolate
group, is also upgrading its operations, from agency to manufacturing in a
joint collaboration with a local company.
The biggest concentration of foreign companies is at the 400-acre Chittagong
Export Processing Zone, where some 57 foreign and local companies with a
collective investment of about Dollars 98m have been attracted by a 10-year
tax holiday, purpose-built factories and non-union staff. A second 38-acre
export zone in Dhaka is due to come on stream next month. A third is
planned. Companies in the export zones escape the stifling red tape that
remains the bane of industry and business.

it untypical of the 30 to 50 garment-making premises which open every month
in Bangladesh.
But its success is typical of a sector so lucrative that some professors at
Dhaka university have opened their own factories, a rare instance of
academics practising what they preach. Retired generals and civil servants
have found second careers in garments.
The garments industry runs against the grain of Bangladesh's manufacturing
industry. It makes money; it is non-unionised; there is no government
interference; and it has a large and growing share of markets in Europe and
the US; and, by employing largely women, it has redefined the 'purdah
culture' in a conservative Moslem country.
Most of the new factories are in back streets, with poor lighting and
ventilation making for a long and unrewarding day. These are operated by
'get rich' entrepreneurs attracted by the prospect of having a plant up and
running within four months. Typically, an investor can set up a medium-size
factory employing about 500 women with just Dollars 200,000 and generate
turnover of Dollars 2m within 12 months.
There are 1,425 garment factories in Bangladesh, which last year earned
Dollars 1.5bn in exports, up by 48 per cent on the previous year. Garments
have grown from zero a decade ago to be the largest export earning sector.
By quantity, Bangladesh is the seventh biggest garment exporter to the US
and the 10th largest exporter to the EC.
Its importance to the domestic economy is twofold. It is the only sector
earning sizeable foreign exchange. And it employs some 738,000 people, of
whom 85 per cent are women.
Most women previously worked as housemaids or were unemployed.
According to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers &amp; Exporters Association,
in 40 per cent of households where a wife is working in garments, she is the
main income earner.
'We have helped create a new and strong consumer spending group,' says
Mohammed Mosharraf Hossain, president of the association.
Some 1.5m square metres of property have been redeveloped for use as garment
factories, while some 80 per cent of commercial road traffic between Dhaka
and Chittagong, the main port, carries goods for the garment trade.
Two government policy decisions set the industry on its feet and continue to
help significantly: the introduction of back-to-back letters of credit
(LCs), and the creation of bonded warehouses.
'With back-to-back LCs we do not have to turn to banks. It means, in effect,
that our suppliers finance us through the issue of LCs, while bonded
warehouses allow us to import materials free of duty if for export
purposes,' says Mr Abu Sayeed Quasem, chairman of NewAge Enterprise.
'We import about 75 per cent of textiles for our garments so these two
factors are very important,' he adds. The value added is mostly in the form
of buttons, cartons, and thread; 80 per cent of these accessories are now
met locally.
The next target is to increase the local value-added content by setting up
textile plants in Bangladesh to serve garments factories. Some in the
garment sector doubt whether local textile companies could meet the high
quality standards demanded by western importers of Bangladeshi garments.
In addition, the investment required is substantial - at least Dollars 30m
to set up a 'composite plant' encompassing garment and textile operations.
Even installing finishing and dyeing facilities would require between
Dollars 2m and Dollars 3m.
Bangladesh's appalling industrial relations record is also a further
handicap. Labour is cheap, but, when the cost of the endless one-day strikes
and hartals (general strikes) is taken into account, local labour loses its
comparative advantage.
The industry's growth could also be impeded by the failure of the Gatt to
conclude the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation talks.
Bangladesh is already restricted by the Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which
allows signatories to protect domestic industries by limiting through
bilateral deals the volume of exports from mostly Third World economies.
Under any new Gatt regime MFA quotas would be phased out over a 10-year
period.
A successful outcome to the Gatt talks is vital for a less developed and
trade-dependent economy such as Bangladesh.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (2): Pointscoring in a democratic
consensus - Khozem Merchant traces the rivalry between the two women who
dominate the political arena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KHOZEM MERCHANT

<DATELINE>
   A TRADITIONAL Iftar party earlier this month
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
celebrating the end of the day's Ramadan fast - became a game of political
pointscoring. The winner was Khaleda Zia, the prime minister. Against all
expectations, Mrs Zia attended the party hosted by her arch rival Sheikh
Hasina, leader of the opposition Awami League.
The local press described Mrs Zia's move as a victory of statesmanship over
petty-mindedness, an act it hoped would help to reconcile the two. For 18
months they had spurned each other's invitations, issued more out of
political nicety than affection. 'From my side I have no rivalry (with her).
I do not know about her,' says the prime minister.
However, genuine reconciliation may be a long way off.
The two leaders dominate their parties and domestic politics. The tendency,
according to a western diplomat, is for the opposition to be preoccupied
with Mrs Hasina's personal battles and for the government to be constantly
on the defensive and unable to define a clear strategy for the future.
Mrs Zia and Mrs Hasina entered politics as standard bearers respectively for
their murdered husband (President Zia ur Rahman) and father (Sheikh Mujib ur
Rahman, who led the struggle for an independent Bangladesh).
'Both the women hark back to the events surrounding the creation of the
state 22 years ago,' says a foreign diplomat. Mrs Hasina, for instance, is
determined to repeal the indemnity given to her father's killers.
It is these historical issues which divide the ruling Bangladesh National
Party and the Awami League. Their aggressive partisanship hinders consensus
on pressing problems, such as the economy on which the two parties claim
common ground.
Though Mrs Zia continues to invoke the spirit of her husband, recalling for
instance his '19-point economic plan' - a vague strategy which lacked
substance - she insists she is her own person. 'I am a different personality
(than my husband) and developed my policies during nine years of the
autocratic Ershad regime.'
General Hossain Ershad, who seized power in 1982, resigned in December 1990
in the face of opposition protests and student demonstrations. Mr Ershad was
arrested and tried on charges of illegal possession of arms and abuse of
power. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. Mrs Zia came to power
after winning the country's first free elections in February 1991.
The prime minister is trying to escape the past. In recent months she has
toured rural areas, addressing crowds of up to 500,000. 'She is trying to
shift the political ground. She is raising very important issues such as
poverty, education and illiteracy at a critical time,' says Talukder
Maniruzzaman, a political scientist at Dhaka university.
With the government under intense pressure to implement a tough World Bank
programme, Mrs Zia needs to sell it to the people. Her speeches in the
countryside are also enabling her to widen her political support. Urban
critics have always accused her of being out of touch with the people
because of her 'cantonment culture', a reference to her life in the barracks
as the wife of a soldier.
However, as Professor Maniruzzaman says: 'The government is drifting. She
has not been spectacularly successful but she sets the tone of government.
There is a logic in her approach. Her intentions are good. She emphasises
development.'
The sense of drift is partly explained by inexperience. Only five of her
40-member cabinet had ministerial experience when appointed. Few capable
candidates are waiting in the wings. The majority of the 1991 parliamentary
intake were political novices, newly-rich businessmen. In any case, the
prime minister is loyal to her friends.
Her real accomplishment has been to sustain the momentum behind the
transition to democracy. The press speaks its mind and the Jatiya Sangsad,
the parliament, though lacking some of the sharper skills of democratic
politics, functions well. Both main parties are committed to parliamentary
democracy. Nobody is knocking at the army's door.
The army is content. Its refusal to bail out General Ershad was an important
turning point for the military. Today, the army believes its interests are
broadly served by Mrs Zia's brand of Bangladeshi nationalism and commitment
to Islam.
Mrs Zia's other accomplishment has been to strengthen her position within
the BNP. Among cabinet colleagues, she alone enjoys national support. Though
some ministers, such as Mr Saifur Rahman at finance, are acknowledged to be
doing a good job, they scarcely represent a challenge to Mrs Zia.
Nor is she under threat from other traditional quarters. Students, who
played a critical role in forcing Ershad's downfall, have been largely
tamed.
The Jamaat-e-Islami, the radical Islamic party, enjoyed brief influence
after the election by supporting the BNP and giving it an overall majority.
But with the appointment of 30 nominated women members to parliament - most
allied to the BNP - the parliamentary wing of the Islamic party has been
sidelined. The Jamaat-e-Islami's influence is mostly confined to local
politics where its powerful cadre and organisational strength ensures it a
strong voice in by-elections.
The Awami League is seen by political observers as enfeebled, its attacks
confined to personalities and rarely on issues of substance. The party lacks
a coherent strategy and is internally divided. Sheikh Hasina needs to think
afresh. She may start by revising the guest list for this week's Eid party
marking the end of Ramadan.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (1) Poverty and democracy - Bangladesh,
one of the world's most aid-dependent democracies, has been meeting economic
targets set by the international lenders. But it has a long way to go
alleviate its people's poverty and to revitalise its inefficient state
industries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TWO years after its first free elections, Bangladesh's fragile transition to
democracy is holding firm. Prime minister Khaleda Zia, the country's first
democratically-elected ruler, can boast substantial progress in economic
reforms and, after three bumper crops, near self-sufficiency in foodgrains.
Though this represents a remarkable turnaround for Bangladesh, half its 118m
population still lives in poverty.
Mrs Zia, widow of soldier-president Zia ur Rahman whose assassination in
1981 forced her into the political arena, can point to some notable
achievements.
First is the transition to parliamentary democracy after more than 20 years
of military rule. The army, says Talukder Maniruzzaman, a political
scientist at Dhaka university, is unlikely to attempt to seize back the
power it lost in 1990 when General Hossain Ershad was forced to resign
following student demonstrations and opposition pressure.
Second, the government, buoyed by higher tax revenues, is making a larger
contribution to its annual development programme for capital projects. For
years the programme has largely been paid for by foreign aid because of a
lack of local funds. This year, the government hopes to make a 27 per cent
contribution to the Taka 86.5bn (Pounds 1.48bn) programme.
Bangladesh is one of the most heavily aid-dependent economies in the world.
It receives annually the equivalent of some 7-8 per cent of gross domestic
product in foreign aid. Bangladesh has been pledged about Dollars 29bn in
aid since independence. Insufficient matching funds and long civil service
delays have continuously hampered disbursement of aid. In December alone six
ministries were unable to disburse Dollars 34.31m; Dollars 5.5bn has
accumulated in the aid pipeline waiting to be spent.
In April donors meet in Paris to decide commitments for the next 12 months.
Pledges for 1993-94 are unlikely to equal last year's Dollars 2.2bn.
The government faces strain on several fronts. Its biggest concern is that
the economy is not growing fast enough to alleviate poverty. It has
fulfilled most macro-economic targets set by the International Monetary Fund
and last year achieved 3.8 per cent growth in GDP. Annual inflation is 5.0
per cent, down from 7.2 in the previous year; narrow money growth has been
contained to less than 14 per cent, state spending has been curbed; the
current account deficit is down and foreign reserves have reached a record
Dollars 2bn, enough to cover seven months of imports.
However, according to the World Bank, with population growth now curbed to
2.4 per cent, a minimum of 5.5 per cent GDP increase is needed to improve
the lot of the 50m living in absolute poverty - defined by the Bank as those
consuming less than 1,800 calories a day. In the capital, Dhaka, the
population rise is 8 per cent a year because of an influx of people seeking
work.
The reform package has also included a cut in the fiscal deficit, measures
to boost foreign investment such as allowing overseas companies to hold 100
per cent equity in a local subsidiary and attempts to reduce the size of the
public sector.
However, the government is encountering political opposition to its World
Bank-designed reforms to revive overmanned and indebted industries such as
jute.
Mr Saifur Rahman, finance minister and free-market advocate, has earned
praise from donors and the World Bank for his handling of the economy. But
he faces criticism from Bangladeshi commentators that he answers only to a
constituency in Washington.
Equally angry are the unions which still exert a powerful disruptive
influence. Bangladesh has a poor industrial relations record, and the
frequent strikes seriously harm business. Unions are stepping up their
campaign to protect jobs but the government is resisting wage demands which
it says threaten reform.
The bureaucracy, a traditionally privileged class, is responsible for
implementing the reforms. However, it feels that its own interests are
threatened and opposes the general thrust of the policy. It has a tendency
to obstruct their introduction, for example by delaying decision-making.
Unemployment is also rising. Some 10m are officially out of work, including
an increasing number of educated young. About 1.5m people come on to the job
market each year.
Mrs Zia is trying to address these and other economic issues. In part this
is forced on her; she must maintain the momentum of reform to sell the World
Bank package to the people. Discipline and sacrifice is what she has been
asking of her 500,000-strong audiences in recent speeches. 'We must work
harder and increase productivity,' she says.
Such effort has already borne fruit in the performance of agriculture, which
contributes 38 per cent to GDP and from which 58 per cent of the population
earns its living. Measures such as the withdrawal of fertiliser subsidies,
the privatisation of fertiliser distribution, the introduction of wells and
better irrigation have helped boost agricultural output and efficiency.
For the first time in 20 years, Bangladesh is self-sufficient in rice.
Bumper rice crops have stabilised domestic prices.
Yet this policy has not been without its problems. The government's
determination to boost foodgrain production has adversely affected cropping
patterns. More than 80 per cent of land is allocated to rice, and overall
cereal crop production accounts for 80 per cent of total income from
agriculture. The cultivation of pulses is a casualty; it is often displaced
by a winter rice or wheat crop. Pulses have traditionally been a source of
cheap protein.
In addition to the success in agriculture, the private sector can boast
several accomplishments. The garments sector now employs 738,000 and last
year earned Dollars 1.5bn in exports, about double the level in 1989.
Grameen Bank, an innovative bank founded by Mr Mohammed Yunus, has won
praise around the world, including an endorsement from President Bill
Clinton. Grameen lends more than Pounds 25m a year mostly to poor rural
women. It recovers more than 98 per cent of its lending.
This is in contrast to the nationalised commercial banks. In the 1980s,
these banks made big loans to industry. The result is an accumulation of
Dollars 2.1bn in bad debts, about 33 per cent of total outstanding loans.
The government is overhauling state-owned banks ahead of their privatisation
and strengthening the central bank's supervisory powers. Reform, now in its
second year, is under way.
The same cannot be said of the government's infrastructure project to reduce
the impact of floods. A five-year (1990-95) Flood Action Plan (FAP) was
prepared by the World Bank and presented to Bangladesh's main donors in
1989. The plan envisages the construction of embankments to control three of
the world's largest rivers, the Ganga, Brahmaputra and Meghna.
FAP is widely opposed by local economists and environmentalists who say
embankments are too expensive and inappropriate for Bangladesh.
If FAP goes ahead it would be Bangladesh's biggest single civil engineering
project. But its implementation would pose a huge challenge for a civil
administration already under pressure. There is increasing disquiet that the
government has failed to improve the quality of public administration.
Woeful lack of co-ordination between ministries and an inexperienced cabinet
have inspired complaints about a rudderless government.
Yet the prime minister confidently talks of renewing her mandate with the
people. 'I am confident of winning another term (in 1996),' she says.
Mrs Zia is popularly known by the Bengali nickname of pupul, which means
doll or puppet. But she is clearly determined to prove that she is not
anyone's puppet.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alusuisse makes further cut in
aluminium output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER CUT in German aluminium production was announced yesterday.
Alusuisse-Lonza said output from its smelter at Essen would be reduced to
only one-third of its 135,000 tonnes annual capacity.
This followed an impassioned plea by the Federation of the German Aluminium
Industry on Wednesday when it said more production cuts would be needed
unless domestic power costs were reduced or there was a substantial fall in
exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Mr Jochen Schirner, vice-president of the federation, complained that
Germany had cut capacity by 25 per cent in the past two years since CIS
exports began to surge. But the country's aluminium smelters were still
making losses even though they used some of the most advanced technology in
the world.
Alusuisse, the Swiss producer, had previously cut output at Essen by one
third in March last year. The smelter will now produce only 45,000 tonnes
annually.
Analysts suggested that this action would have little impact on prices and
aluminium for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange closed
yesterday down Dollars 2.25 a tonne at Dollars 1,171.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said the industry 'has been slow to respond to
the low price environment under which it has laboured for so long'. CIS
exports to the west could have been as high as 1.2m tonnes last year
(including 400,000 tonnes via unofficial routes) yet, according to the
International Primary Aluminium Institute statistics, daily production
averaged 41,600 tonnes in January only slightly down from 42,000 tonnes in
December and up from 39,700 in January 1992.
Europe's aluminium industry wants the European Commission to implement a
quota system or introduce tariffs to reduce substantially imports from the
CIS but the German government is against this proposal.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bankers come to rescue of
kiwifruit harvest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MONTHS OF concern over the future of the New Zealand kiwifruit industry
ended this week when a banking syndicate agreed to finance this year's
harvest only three weeks before picking was due to start.
The agreement gave a reprieve to the Kiwifruit Marketing Board, which has a
monopoly to supply the fruit to all international markets apart from
Australia. Its monopolistic position has been under attack by a group called
Integrated Kiwifruit Services, which consists of several big companies,
linked to overseas fruit groups such as Chiquita Brands.
The Kiwifruit Marketing Board, which was formed in 1988, got into serious
financial difficulties last year because of the severe downturn in prices in
Europe. It was unable to pay orchard owners progress payments, and has debts
of about NZDollars 80m (Pounds 28m).
IKS made a bid to buy half the New Zealand crop at a time when the board was
still negotiating to raise money from the banks to finance packing and give
a return to growers. With some growers indicating support for the
independent company, the banks, led by the National Bank, a subsidiary of
Lloyds Bank, appeared to show caution and the negotiations dragged on.
They finally came to an agreement on Wednesday.
The financial agreement sees the banks extend their financing of the
existing debt for three years. In addition there is an advance of NZDollars
80m to help the board pay packing companies, other costs and allow it to pay
growers NZDollars 4 a tray in a series of instalments during the season.
This will be subject to market returns after debt repayments. Market returns
after that will be split 50:50 between growers and the banks.
Mr John Palmer, the chairman of NZKMB, said that in spite of the agreement
it was certain that some growers would not survive because of their own high
levels of debt. They had told the board that they needed a minimum NZDollars
4.50 a tray.
The intervention of the IKS group, whose main spokesman was former Labour
finance minister Sir Roger Douglas, caused deep divisions in the industry.
Most of the companies involved in the group had handled the kiwifruit export
crop before the board was set up at the wish of growers.
They unsuccessfully lobbied the minister of agriculture, Mr John Falloon, to
end the board's monopoly, and say they are now contemplating legal action to
achieve that end. Independent kiwifruit consultants said that although the
IKS appeared to be offering more money to growers to win their support,
their basic offers were similar, with the board adopting a much more
cautious view on likely returns this season.
Fruitgrowers' Federation president Mr Paul Heywood, who supports the board,
said that its offer to pay growers Dollars 4 a tray was realistic. It meant
they could get on with the business of picking and packing this season's
crop and was a commercial deal based on reality.
However IKS's Mr Murray Davies said the deal was a disaster for growers,
whose interests had been sacrificed to serve the interests of bankers. It
left them without enough money to prepare for the 1994 crop, he added.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger wheat surplus forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD wheat production surplus is likely to grow next season to 8m
tonnes from 7m in 1992-93, according to the International Wheat Council's
latest report.
The council forecasts 1993-94 production at 568m tonnes, 'given normal
weather and growing conditions', compared with the 562m tonnes now estimated
for 1992-93. It puts 1993-94 consumption at 560m tonnes, up from 555m tonnes
this season.
Although harvests are expected to be smaller in Western Europe (following a
reduction in the European Community's planted area), the former Soviet
Union, Asia and the Far East, those falls are expected to be more than
compensated by rises in eastern Europe as the sharp fall in 1992-93 is
partially recovered, and in North, South and Central America, the Near East,
Africa and Australia.
On the consumption side the council points out that the big slide in wheat
use from 1990-91's exceptional 574m tonnes to the 555m tonnes estimated for
1992-93 concealed a continuing growth in food use in developing countries.
And it is to the developing world that it looks for 1993-94's overall growth
 -forecasting an 8m-tonne rise to 310m tonnes, compared with a 3m-tonne fall
to 250m tonnes in the industrialised world.
The report raises the wheat council's estimate of the total 1992-93 grain
crop to 1.416bn tonnes from last month's figure of 1.412m tonnes, with most
of the rise coming from a 3m-tonne increase in the coarse grain's estimate,
now 854m tonnes. Total grain consumption for 1992-93 is unchanged at 1.385bn
tonnes.
'Confusion continues to surround the pattern of grain shipments to the
republics of the former Soviet Union,' says the IWC report. 'Some existing
credit lines have been reactivated, others modified and some remain
suspended.'
In order to get round these problems, it notes, Russia has engaged in grain
barter deals involving aluminium, nickel, uranium, diamonds and timber with
Australia, Canada, the EC and under the US Export Enhancement Program.

high-risk reputation
</HEADLINE>

THE PHILIPPINES' mining industry is paying dearly for its inability to
attract development capital for over a decade now. Total value of mineral
production declined last year by 14 per cent to 20.65bn pesos (Pounds 575m),
according to the Bureau of Mines and Geosciences.
It blames the fall on low metal prices, increased operating costs and 'poor
access to replacement capital'.
Copper concentrates output dropped by 8.9 per cent to 521,258 tonnes, which
was also only half the annual production achieved in the early 1980s. Gold
output declined 12 per cent to 22.7 tonnes the lowest level since 1980.
Chromite production also slumped while nickel output was marginally higher.
Mining officials say the outlook for the next five years remains bleak, and
the industry is likely to miss out on any recovery from the current slowdown
in world metals markets.
'Because we have not developed any new ore bodies in the past decade there
is nothing to work on,' explains Mr Joel Muyco, director of the mines
bureau. He says that risk capital in the local mining sector has been scarce
because the country has been considered a high-risk area since the early
1980s in view of the local political and economic crises.
Perceptions of instability have countered the attractions of the country's
huge proven reserves of such minerals as copper, gold, chromite and nickel.
In terms of resource endowment (which indicates the potential for
discovering an ore body) the country continues to rank among the highest in
Asia.
'When the good times come, we have no new ore bodies to offer,' says Mr
Muyco. Much of the available risk capital is now moving towards other
mineral-rich countries such as Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, Mexico and
Chile.
The Philippines hopes to attract these capital flows, however, with a new
Mining Code that allows 100 per cent foreign equity in a local mining
venture. This is actually contained in an executive order issued in 1987 by
Mrs Corazon Aquino, the former president. Unfortunately, most foreign
investors continue to be hesitant because the Aquino order was issued a few
months before the country adopted a new constitution, which, among other
provisions, limited the exploitation of natural resources to companies with
majority Filipino interests.
Mr Fidel Ramos, the new president, is set to sign 'any day now' the first
financial and technical assistance agreement under the new mining code,
according to Mr Muyco. The scheme allows foreign operators to undertake
minerals exploration for their own account, instead of acting as service
contractors for local groups. They are required to spend a minimum of
Dollars 50m, and to reduce their holdings to 40 per cent after recovering
their original investments, which could take 18 to 20 years.
The first financial and technical assistance agreement authorises Arimco of
Australia to explore for copper and gold in a 30,000-hectare (75,000-acre)
area in Nueva Vizcaya province in Luzon. A second, with Western Mining of
Australia, is already lined up for approval.

CAMBIOR, A medium sized Canadian gold producer, plans to invest CDollars 82m
(Pounds 44m) to develop a low-grade Arizona copper deposit with potential
annual output of 30,000 tonnes for 10 years starting in 1995.
It will use the heap-leaching method to extract copper from the open-pit
properties' ore. Reserves are estimated at 100m tonnes of oxide ore
averaging 0.45 per cent copper a tonne. Operating cost will be about 58 US
cents a lb.
Cambior expects to raise its gold output by 80 per cent to well over 600,000
troy ounces this year with the opening of its Omi mine in Guyana.

London's May robusta COFFEE contract tested Dollars 900 a tonne but fell
back on profit taking. London held its value as New York arabica prices
weakened by about 1.5 cents a lb, encouraging London to firm. Traders said
some producer selling took place in New York but was countered by
good-volume fund buying. The fourth day of the ICO talks in London dwelt
largely on technical issues and had no impact on the market. London COCOA
prices edged ahead in featureless trading, unaffected by the latest Gill &amp;
Duffus estimate of the world deficit at 118,000 tonnes for 1992-93. New York
raw SUGAR prices showed light to moderate gains at midday after nearby
months bounced smartly from downside lows. COPPER edged ahead in US dollar
terms on the LME, supported by some light Chinese buying. But dealers expect
the next big move to be downwards, as fundamentals are unexpiring and stocks
are rising. LEAD prices consolidated, following Wednesday's decline to 6 1/2
 year lows; three-month metal closed at Pounds 278.50 a tonne, up Pounds 3.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Import curbs raise hopes for
Cretan bananas - EC quotas on 'dollar' fruit offers a chance to regain lost
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COLLAPSING greenhouses covered in tattered plastic testify to the rapid
decline of banana-growing in Crete since Greece was forced to lift a ban on
imports four years ago. Production has dropped from more than 20,000 tonnes
a year in the mid-1980s to about 5,000 tonnes last year, covering only about
10 per cent of Greek demand.
However, the European Community's decision to impose quotas on Latin and
Central American bananas, the source of most Greek imports, offers Cretan
growers a chance of recovering lost markets on the Greek mainland.
'Local growers are giving up because they can't compete with imports on
price. But if the quotas stick, they could get back in because consumption
is going up,' says Mr George Atzolidakis, an agronomist with the Siteia
Development Organisation in eastern Crete.
'The selling point for Cretan bananas is that they're grown using very
little fertiliser and pesticide. We've persuaded some producers to give up
chemicals entirely in favour of dung and insect predators.'
While demand for bananas is rising steadily, Greek per capita consumption,
at about 5 kg, is still less than half the EC average. Like eastern
Europeans, many Greeks had never tasted a banana before the late 1980s. A
military dictatorship 20 years ago imposed a ban on banana imports, in an
effort to promote production in Crete. The ban was maintained after Greece
joined the EC on grounds of protecting the Cretan growers. It took a long
legal battle, led by would-be banana importers who took their case to the
European Court of Justice, before imports were permitted.
The small fibrous Cretan banana, descended from plants brought from Egypt a
century ago, was always unlikely to attract consumers. It was only after new
varieties were introduced from Israel, together with cultivation methods
developed in the Canary Islands, that Cretan bananas started to appear
Athens.
Cretan growers, mainly in the east and south of the island where winter
temperatures are close to North African levels, spent Dr10bn (Pounds 30m) on
plastic-covered greenhouses and drip watering systems. When production was
at its height, there were almost 500 hectares of greenhouses for bananas in
Crete. Only 100 hectares are still in use, and most Cretan bananas are sold
on the island, with tourists among the biggest consumers.
'We did very well when the producer price was Dr600 a kg. But at less than
Dr250 you might as well go back to olives and vines unless you happen to
enjoy growing bananas,' says Mrs Popi Basias, a grower in Siteia.
Imported bananas are still subject to a Dr195 a kilogram tax, intended to
help keep the Cretan producers in business, although it is due to be phased
out by the end of 1993 under single market rules.
However, wholesalers in Athens are reluctant to handle Cretan bananas, while
admitting their quality is better than fruit from Costa Rica and Colombia.
'Cretan bananas taste good but they're smaller and have a less attractive
appearance than the imports. And even if we start importing more African and
Caribbean bananas because of the quotas on dollar bananas, the Cretan
product can't really compete,' says Mr Myron Mavrikides of Chiquita Hellas,
Greece's largest banana importer.

FT  26 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank rate move underpins European
sentiment

THE BUNDESBANK'S decision to cut one of its short-term interest rates
yesterday raised hopes of a further easing and provided a boost for German
and other European government bond prices.
Bund prices received further encouragement from news in the afternoon that
the Russian parliament chairman, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, said he did not
favour the impeachment of President Boris Yeltsin.
Early in the trading session, the Bundesbank said it had cut its three-day
Treasury bill rate from 8.4 per cent to 7.5 per cent, which is the same
level as the discount rate. Economists pointed out that the move should give
the Bundesbank more freedom to cut its repo rate and allow the call money
rate to fall lower.
'The move went down very well in the market as it means the Bundesbank will
probably lower the discount rate further in the next couple of months,' said
Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson. 'The three-day
T-bill rate has traditionally been above the discount rate, so now that they
are at the same level it creates the impression that the discount rate will
come down,' he added.
The bund futures contract opened at 95.26 and rose steadily to a high of
95.67 towards the close of trading.
The release of disappointing inflation figures from one of the western
German states yesterday had little impact on the market. Consumer prices in
the state of Baden-Wurttemberg rose 0.4 per cent in the month to mid-March
and were up 4.3 per cent from a year earlier.
LONGER-DATED UK government bonds continued to slip as dealers marked down
prices ahead of next week's gilt auction, while short- and medium-dated
issues traded in a relatively narrow range.
Dealers said the  1/8 to  1/4 -point drop in prices among long-dated issues
reflected pre-auction positioning of the market. The Bank of England will
auction Pounds 3bn of a new 20-year stock - the 8 per cent gilt due 2013 -
on March 31.
JAPANESE GOVERNMENT bond prices were pushed sharply lower yesterday by a
combination of yen weakness and a stock market rally.
The June futures contract, which closed on Wednesday at 109.80, traded in a
range of 108.99 to 109.65, before ending the day at 109.03.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 issue opened at 4.09 per cent and moved
between 4.065 per cent and 4.15 per cent, before ending the Tokyo session at
4.135 per cent. The bond market opened on a weaker note, due to the yen's
fall against the US dollar.
Dealers reported some buying interest on weakness late in the Tokyo session.
US TREASURY prices were mixed yesterday afternoon, and trading was fairly
subdued despite a successful auction of Dollars 11bn five-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond fell  11/32 to 103
9/16 , yielding 6.840 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was  1/16 higher, to yield 3.908 per cent.
There was reasonable interest in the afternoon five-year note auction, with
yields of 5.19 per cent, below expectations. The bid-to-cover ratio was
better than usual, at 2.64-to-1, above the average in the last six Dutch
auctions.
There was no need for the Federal Reserve to intervene in the open market,
with Fed Funds trading at 3 per cent, the Fed's target for the rate.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Bonds: AT&amp;T returns with Dollars 400m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications giant, returned to the international bond
market for the first time since 1987 to refinance part of the Dollars 1.5bn
of bonds it decided recently to repay early.
The Dollars 400m, five-year issue was said to have been aggressively priced,
given that the company's credit ratings are under review for a possible
downgrade from both Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. The bonds were priced to
yield 40 basis points over US government bonds.
But AT&amp;T's strong name recognition among retail investors and the relative
lack of new five-year Eurodollar bonds recently ensured success. A number of
banks involved in the transaction reported the bonds had sold well, and they
were freed to trade early in the day.
Other retail-driven deals met a mixed response yesterday. After a recent
five-year Canadian dollar issue from the Kingdom of Denmark, the Mortgage
Bank of Denmark launched CDollars 150m of five-year bonds which carry a
guarantee from the Kingdom. They were launched at a yield spread of 60 basis
points over the Canadian government benchmark, which was said to be too
close to where the Kingdom's own issue was trading at the time to assure the
new bonds of strong demand. Also, much of the Canadian dollar paper issued
recently to take advantage of attractive five-year swap rates is still said
to be with underwriters, leaving little demand for more bonds in the same
maturity. The bonds were bid later in the day at 99.20, down from the 99.45
at which they were offered, despite a rise in the Canadian government bond
market.
A better reception greeted the latest bond issue from a Latin American
borrower, a Dollars 150m offer from the public-sector Bancomext (Banco de
Comercio Exterior). At seven years, the issue extends the maturity further
than recent Mexican issues. The yield spread of 220 basis points over US
Treasuries, compared with the 208 basis point spread on the recent five-year
United Mexican States issue from Deutsche Bank, was said to be fairly priced
by banks not involved in the transaction.
The steady flow of Mexican paper in recent weeks contrasts with the flood of
Brazilian bonds in the past fortnight. Banco do Brasil added to this on
Wednesday with a Dollars 100m, five-year deal through CSFB at a yield spread
of 540 basis points. Although from a highly-regarded borrower, the bonds
presented a severe test for the market.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Japan set to restrict Euroyen
issue access
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ministry of finance is poised to tighten its grip on placements of
yen-denominated corporate bonds issued overseas by clamping down on Japanese
purchases of Euroyen bonds.
The decision is seen as an attempt to protect the country's fledgling
corporate bond market, which is currently sagging under the surge of
domestic straight bond issues.
The move could also depress the number of yen bonds issued in the Eurobond
markets by Japanese companies as the restriction on placement may lead to
higher issuance costs.
The ministry has tried to keep Eurobonds offshore by prohibiting yen bonds
issued overseas from entering the country for the first 90 days of issuance.
Japanese securities houses have found their way around the restrictions,
however, by agreeing to hold the bonds for three months before selling the
paper off to Japanese investors at the issuing price.
Foreign criticism has been rising over the lack of transparency of the
agreements between Japanese brokers and investors. The ministry may now
start monitoring the placement of Euroyen bonds to prevent the 'warehousing'
of bonds.
Buying Eurobonds has allowed Japanese investors to avoid paying withholding
tax, so increasing the returns on investments.
Japanese brokers and overseas underwriting affiliates of Japanese banks will
be seriously affected by the ministry's restrictions. Japanese brokers,
which have turned to overseas bonds as an important source of income
following the sharp fall in profits due to the sluggish Tokyo stock market,
will be especially hard hit.
After Japanese companies were permitted to raise money on the Euroyen bond
markets in 1990, they issued Y3,130bn in 1991 and Y2,800bn last year.
One US investment banker welcomed the move, saying it would 'cleanse' the
Euroyen bond market, making prices and trading less artificial.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Association planned for UK
derivatives industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRADE association to represent the futures and options industry in the UK
is likely to be proposed formally within a matter of weeks, following the
announcement yesterday of a formation group set up to study the idea.
The derivatives industry - estimated by one member of the formation group to
employ more than 20,000 people in London, up from 5,000 seven years ago -
remains one of the largest interest groups in the City not represented by
its own trade association.
Until now, it has relied on the efforts of the Joint Exchanges Committee,
comprising Liffe, the London Fox, the London Metal Exchange and the
International Petroleum Exchange. However, the association is intended to
represent the over-the-counter markets as well as exchange-traded ones.
All four exchanges are represented on the formation group, along with OM
London, the London Clearing House, and representatives from eight houses
involved in futures and options. Mr Alastair Clark, of the Bank of England,
has been appointed as an observer.
The group, which first met earlier this week, is expected to meet twice more
in the coming weeks before producing a formal proposal for the association.
It is chaired by Mr Brian Williamson, chairman of Gerrard &amp; National and a
member of the board of the Securities and Investments Board, who is expected
to stand down as soon as the formation group has made its recommendation.
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) has applied for membership to the London
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange in order to broker and
execute Liffe's newly-launched Spanish bond futures.

THE MATIF, in a last-minute move, has postponed listing its largest
contract, Notional bond futures, on the Chicago-based Globex electronic
trading system. The contract was to have been added to the system today.
Matif said technical problems had prompted the decision. Globex is owned by
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and Reuters
Holdings.
A Matif spokeswoman said: 'The Notional bond is our biggest contract. We
want to make sure the system is 99.9 per cent certain before we launch.'
She said Reuters Holdings, which designed and operates the system, was
working to fix the technical problems, adding there was no new listing date
for the contract.
Globex has nearly doubled its volume since Matif listed its Pibor and Ecu
contracts on the system on March 12.

FOREIGN investment in Canadian securities has reached record levels in
recent months, due largely to a spate of bond issues by the provinces and
their agencies.
Statistics Canada said yesterday that net inflows in January totalled
CDollars 6bn, up from CDollars 3.6bn in December and CDollars 846m in
January 1992.
The surge is in sharp contrast to net outflows last autumn, when investors
were unsettled by uncertainty over the referendum on a proposed new
constitution.
Besides the return of calm on the political front, the gap between Canadian
and US long-term interest rates widened by about 25 basis points in January
to 1.25 percentage points.
About 70 per cent of January's inflows were channelled into new bond issues,
mainly by the provinces.

Fairfax

<TEXT>
THE Australian government yesterday played down claims by Mr Conrad Black,
the Canadian proprietor of The Telegraph UK newspaper group, that it would
shortly approve his plans to buy more shares in John Fairfax.
Mr Black told Reuters news agency that The Telegraph expected its
application for permission to increase its stake in Fairfax from 15 per cent
to 25 per cent to be approved.
'We expect our bid to increase our shareholding to be successful,' Mr Black
said. However, aides to Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer (finance minister),
said no decision had been made.
'I think he is being a little bit premature,' an official said. 'The issue
has to be deliberated (sic) by caucus.'
Mr Dawkins has until April 24 to decide whether to allow the increased
shareholding, following an inconclusive report by the Foreign Investment
Review Board, which vets overseas investment proposals.
In practice, the final decision will be taken by the ruling Labor party's
parliamentary caucus, which has previously sought to limit overseas holdings
in newspaper groups to a maximum 20 per cent.
Officials say the government has discounted reports in the Fairfax press
that Mr Black would sell the Telegraph's existing holding to Mr Kerry
Packer, the Australian entrepreneur, if his application is denied.
Under Australian cross-media ownership laws, Mr Packer would be limited to a
15 per cent holding in Fairfax, provided he could show that the shareholding
would not give him control of the group.
Fairfax is the main competitor to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation
group. Its titles include the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne) Age,
the Australian Financial Review and Business Review Weekly.

SHUN Tak, the Macau jetfoil operator owned by casino tycoon Mr Stanley Ho,
yesterday announced an 18.5 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars
511.4m (USDollars 66m) for 1992, up from HKDollars 431.4m in 1991.
The company's jetfoil operations experienced slower growth, but this was
compensated for by an increase in property sales. If sales continue
according to the current schedule, the company is expected to show a 50 per
cent increase in profits for the current year.
Shun Tak wrote off the value of its entire investment in Air Hong Kong, the
air cargo operator, resulting in an extraordinary loss of HKDollars 187.2m,
as the management has accepted it is unlikely to return to profitability.
From February, the company has reaped the benefits of a increase in jetfoil
fares.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mudslinging prompts a quick fall
 -Yamaha's troubles have been all too public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE downfall of Mr Hiroshi Kawakami, the ex-president of Yamaha, the world's
largest musical instruments maker, has been swift and unceremonious.
Last Friday, just a year after he was forced out as president, he was made
to relinquish his seat on the Yamaha board and was appointed head of a
little-known affiliate which develops holiday resorts in Hokkaido, Japan's
remote northernmost island.
The latest move against Mr Kawakami was triggered by an article in a popular
weekly magazine in which he gave his account of his removal from the
presidency.
He said intrigue against the Kawakami family and a management coup, rather
than the official explanation that he was stepping down to take
responsibility for the company's sluggish performance, were the real reasons
for his resignation.
This revelation proved his final undoing. Mr Kawakami, by carrying on his
feud in a magazine, committed the unforgivable crime of exposing Yamaha's
shame in public.
To the Japanese, unaccustomed to public demonstrations of corporate discord,
the goings-on at Yamaha seemed more appropriate to a third-rate TV soap
opera than a prestigious international corporation.
For Yamaha the public mud-slinging was not just disgraceful; it was totally
unbecoming a company which counts among its sister companies Yamaha Motor,
the world's second-largest motorcycle manufacturer, and Yamaha Music
Foundation, a network of music schools teaching millions of Japanese
children.
The ousting of Mr Kawakami was an unusual display of a Japanese labour union
flexing its muscles and joining forces with management to remove a leader
they felt to be inadequate. However, with the deteriorating economic
environment in Japan, such management-labour alliances to force out
incompetent chief executives are becoming more common.
In February last year, Yamaha's labour union was scheduled to meet Mr
Kawakami and the management to discuss his responsibility for the company's
sluggish profits and lack of direction. However, Mr Kawakami called in sick,
prompting the union call for his resignation.
The next day, Mr Kawakami, at the helm for over eight years, resigned and
was replaced by the vice-president, Mr Seisuke Ueshima. Mr Hiroshi Kawakami
was the third Kawakami family member to have run Yamaha since Mr Kaichi
Kawakami rescued the company nearly 60 years ago from the brink of
bankruptcy.
The family's total shareholding in the group, however, is less than 1 per
cent, although it wielded enough power to ensure the succession.
Critics said Mr Hiroshi Kawakami, an avid skier and concert-goer, was more
interested in classical music and sports cars than in turning around the
company's slumping businesses. After nearly 10 years of lacklustre
performance with no prospect of improvement, falling employee morale and
lack of trust in the management finally prompted the labour union to act.
Yamaha has suffered from a continuing decline in its core musical
instruments business. Unit sales of pianos have fallen from a peak in 1980
of 238,000 to 160,000 a year. Areas into which the company has diversified,
from sporting goods to furniture and audio equipment, are suffering from the
slowdown in consumer spending.
Pre-tax profits fell to Y2.83bn (Dollars 24m) in the year to March 1992 from
Y4.25bn the year before.
A restructuring programme aimed at returning pre-tax profits to Y10bn in
1995 was launched belatedly last year. But the post of chairman has been
left vacant while Mr Ueshima, who was vice-president for nearly nine years
before becoming president, is himself hardly free of blame for the company's
lack of direction over the past few years.
Unless Yamaha opts to bring in new management from outside, the company's
only hope for full-scale recovery lies in its current management displaying
the kind of leadership skills it has so far failed to show.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Codan in renewed bid for Hafnia
unit
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CODAN, the Danish insurer controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance, yesterday
made a new bid to acquire the insurance operations of Hafnia, the Danish
insurer.
The group put its insurance business up for sale after the parent company,
Hafnia Holding, suspended payments last autumn.
Codan's bid cuts across plans for an all-Danish solution to the crisis in
the Danish insurance industry caused by the financial problems at Hafnia and
its rival Baltica, which has reported a DKr4.4bn (Dollars 699m) loss in
1992.
Baltica offered to acquire Hafnia's insurance and banking operations last
Monday, when it also announced a re-organisation by which the parent
company, Baltica Holding, will be reduced to a minority shareholder in
Baltica Insurance.
This move caused a big drop in the share price in Baltica Holding, which in
turn affected Hafnia, which is the largest shareholder in Baltica Holding
with just over 33 per cent.
Codan was among several companies which made offers earlier this year to
acquire Hafnia's insurance business. Last Sunday Codan withdrew the offer,
but according to Mr Peter Zobel, Codan's chief executive, the offer was
remade this week.
Difficult conditions in world shipping markets cut net profits in the
Lauritzen shipping and shipbuilding group to DKr83m (Dollars 13m) in 1992
from DKr320m in the previous year.
Group sales increased from DKr13.15bn to DKr13.84bn, but profits after net
financial items were down from DKr416m to DKr146m, and after ship disposals
and extraordinary items from DKr545m to DKr186m.
The group said that earnings by the Lauritzen refrigerated cargo business,
in which it operates one of the world's largest fleets, gas tankers and
offshore drilling rigs, were unsatisfactory.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield sees better
year after heavy loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVESTA SHEFFIELD, the newly-formed Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer,
should record 'substantially better' results this year after heavy losses in
1992, according to Mr Per Molin, the president and chief executive.
The Stockholm-based company, which by some measures is Europe's largest
stainless producer, was formed in November from a merger between Avesta of
Sweden and British Steel Stainless.
Last week, it announced a SKr564m (Dollars 73m) loss after financial items
for 1992, and scrapped its dividend. Mr Molin said he could not be more
specific about this year's performance because of uncertainties in the
European market and the currency markets.
But he outlined three points that gave him grounds for optimism; the
devaluation of sterling and the Swedish krone had increased the company's
earnings capability in several key markets; stainless steel consumption
would grow by an average 4 to 6 per cent a year this decade; and the merger
itself was turning out better than expected.
The new company is hoping to increase its market share through offering a
wider range of products, but has also moved quickly to gain production
efficiencies. Two hot-rolled plate lines and a precision strip mill in
Sheffield have been closed, and the production of cold-rolled plate has been
redistributed between the UK and Sweden.
But Mr Molin said it would take some time before decisions were taken on the
company's four melting shops - two in each of its home countries.
'There is no doubt we will have to change that, but this does not mean that
one or two will definitely close,' he said. 'We are analysing the
alternative of producing steel for other companies.'
Avesta Sheffield's largest melting shop, employing nearly 300, is in
Sheffield, and is thought likely to be retained by the company. Its smaller
Panteg plant in Wales produces continuously cast billets, and the other two
melting shops are in Sweden.
The changes are important if Avesta Sheffield is to achieve Mr Molin's
forecast for this year. Stainless steel prices are rising, but European
consumption of stainless is likely to be about the same as last year before
resuming its relatively strong long-term growth later.

<TEXT>
MR PAUL Reichmann, the guiding light in the rise and fall of Olympia &amp; York,
has recruited several former O&amp;Y employees to help him rebuild his
reputation in the international property business.
Reichmann International, Mr Reichmann's new company, has rented offices in
Toronto formerly occupied by O&amp;Y. The restructured, but much-shrunken, O&amp;Y
emerged from bankruptcy protection this month under the effective control of
its creditors and the day-to-day management of an administrator.
The debt-restructuring included the creation of a modest-sized property
management company, O&amp;Y Properties, under the management of Mr Philip
Reichmann, Mr Paul Reichmann's nephew, and Mr Frank Hauer, his son-in-law.
The elder Reichmann signalled his ambition to play on a bigger field by
setting up Reichmann International. He recently announced he was teaming up
with Mr George Soros, the New York investment manager, to create an
international property fund.
RI's recruits include Mr Peter Anderson, an American finance specialist. Mr
Anderson spearheaded the abortive attempt by Canary Wharf, O&amp;Y's former
flagship project in London's Docklands, to raise money in the months before
its collapse through an Enterprise Zone unit trust.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mexico provides an attractive
brew - The rationale of Modelo's joint venture with Anheuser-Busch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORONA, the light golden Mexican beer, became an international success story
in the 1980s. Sold in stylish, clear bottles, it leaped from being the
tipple of poor Mexican workers to become a fashionable drink in the US.
Now the beer will be part owned by the US brewing group Anheuser-Busch, the
world's largest.
Grupo Modelo, Corona's producer, has been a tightly controlled
privately-owned family company since 1925.
The handful of owners, led by Mr Don Juan Sanchez Navarro, are icons of the
Mexican business community, and between them have helped run the company for
more than 40 years.
They have sold an effective 18 per cent of their company to Anheuser-Busch
for Dollars 477m in cash. Soon the owners will take Modelo public, offering
another 13 per cent of capital for an expected Dollars 270m in national and
international markets.
From 1995 to 1997, Anheuser-Busch has an option to raise its stake to 35 per
cent.
By Mexican standards, Modelo is a peculiar company. It does not believe in
debt; hardly pays dividends, preferring to re-invest its money; and
throughout the wild expansionary days of the late 1970s and early 1980s
stuck resolutely to beer.
However, Modelo had , says Mr Sanchez Navarro, to face the consequences of
the North American Free Trade Agreement. 'How can we be more competitive?'
he asks 'By fighting the American beer groups? Probably they would break us
apart. Not exactly in quality, but in prices and sales strategy.
'If they are our partners they cannot. Now we can dedicate our money to
improving our distribution systems, and the installations in our factories.'
Modelo's joint venture with Anheuser is no doubt prompted by similar
ventures expected to be made by its arch-rival, Fomenta Economico Mexicana
(Femsa).
Philip Morris, the US foods group and owner of Miller beer, recently bought
7.9 per cent of Femsa from Citibank for Dollars 156m.
Analysts expect Miller and Femsa's beer division to announce a tie-up later
this year, giving the two largest beer groups in the US a foothold in
Mexico.
Femsa's two breweries have combined sales of Dollars 1.3bn, giving it 49 per
cent of Mexico's domestic beer market, against Modelo's 51 per cent.
The two companies have the best distribution networks in Mexico, have tied
up most retail outlets in exclusivity contracts, and have - through labels
such as Sol, Tecate, Dos Equis of Femsa, and Corona, Negro Modelo and
Victoria of Modelo - a firm hold on Mexican brand consciousness.
Their tight control over the beer market explains why Anheuser entered the
Mexican market through Modelo, rather than going it alone.
Imports account for just 0.4 per cent of the Mexican market. This may change
under Nafta, with tariffs planned to come down from 20 per cent to zero over
eight years.
Mexico should prove an attractive market for the US beer companies for other
reasons.
Beer consumption is just 47 litres per person annually, about half that in
the US. As incomes rise, consumption should increase over the next decade -
by 5 per cent annually in volume terms, according to Lavinia Agnew of Baring
Research in Mexico City, against 1 per cent annually in the US.
Profit margins, held down by government price controls, excise taxes, and
low incomes are expected to increase from their depressed levels of about 10
per cent. Both Femsa and Modelo are increasingly dividing their beers into
premium and basic brands, enabling them to increase margins on some beers.
Anheuser-Busch and Modelo will inter-change personnel in marketing,
distribution and finance, giving the Mexican company a significant edge in
meeting new demand at home. Modelo is increasing output capacity by about
half by building a Dollars 500m state-of-the art brewery in Zacatecas. Its
capacity is1.2m litres.
Modelo will also use the joint venture to continue its expansion overseas,
although in the US it will keep its existing distribution companies.
After flattening out in the US in the late 1980s, sales have picked up, with
Corona re-claiming the number two spot for imported beers last year. Sales
were around 15m cases - up 13 per cent on 1991. Corona is now sold in 56
countries, with total exports of around Dollars 150m.
Much to its chagrin, the only country where it lies behind Femsa is the UK,
where Femsa's Sol beer has had the same impact Corona had in the US in the
mid-1980s.
Sol's export version is a pale, fizzy beer, and as such is unknown in
Mexico. But because of its success Femsa is planning to sell it in Mexico,
complete with English labels.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: US brewers look for more
overseas flavour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEALS are coming thick and fast. On Monday, Anheuser-Busch, the number
one brewing company in the US, unveiled plans to buy a 17.7 per cent stake
in Mexico's leading beer producer, Grupo Modelo. A few days earlier, it
announced a joint venture with Kirin Brewery in Japan.
In January, Miller Brewing, the second-largest US brewer and part of the
giant Philip Morris group, bought a 20 per cent interest in Molson
Breweries, Canada's largest brewer.
In December, Miller took a near 8 per cent interest in Fomento Economico
Mexicano, a second Mexican brewer whose market share is only slightly
smaller that Grupo Modelo's.
The rationale behind the flurry of activity is fairly simple: the US
brewers' home market has been depressingly flat of late.
The Beverage Marketing Corporation, a New York-based consultancy group,
estimates US domestic beer sales amounted to 188m barrels last year,
virtually unchanged from the 1988 figure of 187.4m barrels.
In the three intervening years, sales stood at 188.1m, 193.2m, and 188.8m
barrels respectively. The fillip in 1990, moreover, was largely explained by
a run-up in stocks ahead of a doubling in federal excise tax.
The explanations for this bleak situation range from the ageing of the
'baby-boom' generation to the higher tax burden and associated rise in
prices. Increasing emphasis on 'healthy' eating and drinking has played a
significant part, too.
For years, the big brewers have been producing 'light' beers, and the top
three brands - Miller Lite, Coors Light and Bud Light - now account for more
than one-fifth of US beer sales.
Within this maturing industry, Anheuser has achieved creditable market share
gains. It has increased its take of the US domestic market from around 35
per cent in the mid-1980s to over 44 per cent last year, and has a declared
target of 50 per cent. After-tax profits have also increased steadily.
But Anheuser's attempts to diversify into food, snacks, theme parks, even
bio-technology, are widely judged to have been a flop. For some analysts,
then, a move to expand the core beer business out of the domestic arena and
into international markets which are still growing, cannot come a moment too
soon.
Mexico has obvious attractions: the beer market has been expanding, in
volume terms, at around 6 per cent annually, while the North American Free
Trade Treaty would bind the country more closely to the US economy and
accelerate Mexico's growth. Nafta also anticipates that a fairly heavy
tariff on imported beers would be phased out.
However, Anheuser has made clear that its interest in Grupo Modelo focuses
primarily on the Mexican brewer's potential in its own market, rather than
as a conduit for selling Budweiser abroad.

Mr Tully is due to become Merrill's chairman in June on the retirement of Mr

The restructuring, Merrill's third in three years, comes at a time of
intensifying competition in broking - demonstrated by the recent merger
agreement between rivals Smith, Barney and Shearson - and investment
banking, an area where Merrill has big ambitions.
Mr Tully said the new structure was the 'next logical step in Merrill's
strategic evolution over the past two decades from a sales-oriented
organisation to a marketing-oriented, client-focused financial management
and advisory company'.
The office of the chairman includes Messrs Schreyer and Tully along with Mr
Stephen Hammerman, vice-chairman, and Mr John Heimann, chairman of global
financial institutions.
It involves two other men who have been given new titles: Mr Barry
Friedberg, head of the investment banking group since 1985, becomes
chairman, investment banking.
Mr Thomas Patrick, previously executive vice-president, equity markets
group, becomes chairman, special advisory services, in charge of liaising
with clients on new product ideas.
The executive office includes Mr Tully, Mr Hammerman, and Mr John Steffens,
executive vice-president for the private client group, along with two other
men given new titles: Mr Herbert Allison becomes executive vice-president
for investment banking and Mr David Komansky becomes executive
vice-president for both the debt and equities markets groups.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Reichmann selects fresh team
from O&amp;Y staff

<TEXT>
MR PAUL Reichmann, the guiding light in the rise and fall of Olympia &amp; York,
has recruited several former O&amp;Y employees to help him rebuild his
reputation in the international property business.
Reichmann International, Mr Reichmann's new company, has rented offices in
Toronto formerly occupied by O&amp;Y. The restructured, but much-shrunken, O&amp;Y
emerged from bankruptcy protection earlier this month under the effective
control of its creditors and the day-to-day management of a lender-appointed
administrator.
The debt-restructuring included the creation of a modest-sized property
management company, O&amp;Y Properties, under the management of Mr Philip
Reichmann, Mr Paul Reichmann's nephew, and Mr Frank Hauer, his son-in-law.
The elder Reichmann, however, signalled his ambition to play on a bigger
field by setting up Reichmann International. He recently announced he was
teaming up with Mr George Soros, the New York investment manager, to create
an international property fund. The fund's first investment is expected to
be in Mexico.
RI's recruits include Mr Peter Anderson, an American finance specialist. Mr
Anderson spearheaded the abortive attempt by Canary Wharf, O&amp;Y's former
flagship project in London's Docklands, to raise money in the months before
its collapse through an Enterprise Zone unit trust.
Mr Anderson went to Canary Wharf about two years ago from Swiss Bank
Corporation's London office, where he was executive director in charge of
equities.
RI has also hired Mr Ronald Soskolne, a South African-born architect who led
the design team for Canary Wharf and New York's World Financial Centre.
Neither Mr Anderson nor Mr Soskolne has a formal title.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sandoz sets pace in Swiss
pharmaceuticals sector

<TEXT>
SANDOZ, the first of the three large Basle-based chemical and pharmaceutical
groups to report 1992 results, has set a high standard for Ciba-Geigy and
Roche to match.
Consolidated net income rose 34 per cent to SFr1.49bn (Dollars 993m) on
sales up 8 per cent to SFr14.4bn.
However, about half of the profit increase was attributable to the
first-time application of international accounting standards (IAS), the main
effect of which was to extend depreciation schedules.
On a strictly comparable basis with the previous year, net profit was up 17
per cent to SFr1.3bn.
The directors showed their confidence that the sharply higher level of
earnings could be maintained by recommending that the annual dividend be
raised by 34 per cent to SFr47 per share or participation certificate.
Cash-flow was up 19 per cent to SFr2.27bn and the net return on sales rose
to 10.4 per cent from 8.3 per cent.
Pharmaceuticals account for just under half of group sales, and
significantly more of its profits. The group's portfolio is led by
Sandimmun, a drug widely used for suppressing the body's immune system
reactions to transplanted organs.
Investments in fixed assets fell 6 per cent to SFr1.19bn, but spending on
research and development was up 13 per cent to SFr1.49bn or 10.4 per cent of
consolidated sales.
Sandoz said that Mr Marc Moret, the shy but autocratic chairman who has
dominated the group for more than a decade, would stand down as president of
the executive board. Mr Moret, 69, will remain chairman and will still be
chief executive officer 'for a certain period'.
The new president of the executive board and chief operating officer will be
Mr Daniel Wagniere, now chief executive of the group's US subsidiary and a
Sandoz employee since 1965.
Along with the executive changes, Sandoz is regrouping its businesses into
two divisions; life sciences, and chemicals and environment. Mr Urs
Barlocher, head of Sandoz Nutrition, will lead the life sciences division,
comprising the pharmaceutical, seeds and nutrition businesses.
Mr Rolf Schweizer, vice-president of the executive board, will head the
chemicals and environment division.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Merck warning heralds bumpy ride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the first time, pharmaceutical groups operating in the US are feeling
the effects of price competition. The extent of the change from the 1980s,
when drugs companies could increase earnings merely by raising prices, was
forcefully underlined this week as Merck, the world's largest
pharmaceuticals company, announced a profits warning.
The group, regularly voted the best-managed in America, blamed its slowing
growth on the increasingly turbulent competitive environment in the US.
Healthcare cost-containment measures in other countries and adverse currency
movements were also cited.
The market has become accustomed to weaker groups such as Eli Lilly
forecasting slowing growth, but not companies of Merck's quality.
Merck, like other companies, has been hit by the growing power of the
US-managed healthcare market to control prices. The proportion of medicines
influenced by managed healthcare has increased from about 15 per cent of the
market five years ago to about 50 per cent, according to Mr Hemant Shah,
pharmaceutical analyst at HKS in New York.
Managed health providers, which include private health maintenance
organisations and preferred provider organisations, as well as government
schemes such as Medicaid for the poor and Medicare for the old, are anxious
to keep down drug bills. They are increasingly choosing medicines on price.
SmithKline Beechamendured a 1.6 per cent reduction in US prices last year.
In therapeutic areas with many medicines in the same class - such as
antibiotics, ace-inhibitors (a heart treatment), and gastro-intestinal drugs
 -managed healthcare groups have been able to trade one drug off against
another to drive down prices.
Drugs manufacturers have been forced to compete by offering discounts. Those
whose prices are too high risk exclusion from managed healthcare formularies
 -the lists of medicines doctors prescribe.
Sales growth of Merck's cholesterol-lowering drugs Zocor and Mevacor has
been hit by the aggressive pricing of Bristol-Myers Squibb's
recently-launched Pravachol. Merck announced temporary price cuts for its
cholesterol products this month.
Price competition is set to worsen, with a number of significant drugs
losing patent protection over the next two years. None of Merck's drugs are
directly affected, but the introduction of cheap generic medicines where
Merck has relatively expensive patented products will hit sales.
Next year, sales of Merck's anti-ulcer drug Pepcid and Glaxo's Zantac are
likely to suffer as managed healthcare groups switch to cheap versions of
SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet.
Merck hopes the profits warning and increased price competition will help
convince the Clinton administration that market forces are working in the
drug industry.
However, Mr Shah believes additional pricing pressure is likely to be
created through a vast extension in the purchasing power of the government.
The government already accounts for about 15 per cent of the drugs market.
After the reforms, the government could cover the costs of retired people's
drugs, equivalent to 35 per cent of the market, and those of 37m presently
uninsured, representing about 15 per cent of the market.
Pharmaceutical groups are now faced with the prospect of falling margins.
Merck announced its first job-reduction programme this week.
Weaker companies are bound to follow with rationalisation plans. They may
then be forced into another wave of mergers.

GIB Group, one of Belgium's two largest retailers, pushed up sales by 5 per
cent in the year to January 31 1993, and increased consolidated profit
before tax by 10 per cent to BFr4.18bn (Dollars 124m) from BFr3.79bn
The group's share of consolidated net profits slipped 3 per cent to
BFr3.25bn from BFr3.35bn, partly because GIB had to provide BFr258m for
deferred taxes, to bring the group in line with new accounting rules.
Consolidated turnover last year rose to BFr228bn from BFr217bn and all four
sectors of the group's activity - supermarkets, do-it-yourself, fast-food
and speciality retailing - showed an increase in sales. Super and
hypermarket sales, which account for 61 per cent of the group total, rose by
2 per cent. Cash flow rose 15 per cent to BFr8.9bn.
The group expects to announce detailed results and dividends in May.

FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: VNU hit by provision on printing
unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VNU, the Dutch publisher, said a large provision needed for its printing
division caused 1992 net profit to tumble by nearly 60 per cent to Fl 47.9m
(Dollars 26.2m).
The company, which is engaged in talks on trying to sell part of its
printing operations, said it planned to maintain its dividend at Fl 3.60
because the Fl 80m printing provision was a one-off item and also because
most of its businesses saw improved performances last year.
If it had not been for the provision, VNU's net profit would have risen by
just under 10 per cent to Fl 127.9m.
Operating profit rose by 18.2 per cent to Fl 241.2m, on turnover that was
steady at Fl 2.74bn. VNU attributed the profit rise to reorganisations and
cost-cutting measures.

the summer

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HERMES, one of France's most famous luxury goods groups, plans to go public
this summer by floating part of its equity on the second market in Paris.
The flotation, details of which will be announced in Paris next week, will
mark the end of a tradition of independence for Hermes, which has been
controlled by the Hermes family since 1837 when Mr Thierry Hermes set up a
workshop to make horse harnesses in Paris.
However, the founding family, which owns just under 90 per cent of the
equity, is expected to retain control after the flotation. Companies need
only release a minimum of 10 per cent of their equity to join the second
market.
Hermes, best known for its silk scarves and leather products, has recently
been revitalised under the chairmanship of Mr Jean-Louis Dumas, the fifth
generation of the Hermes family to run the company. The group's sales rose
five-fold during the 1980s to peak at FFr2.56bn (Dollars 457m) in 1989.
Mr Dumas has pursued a strategy of aggressive international expansion,
combined with scrupulous quality control. Hermes operates at the top of the
luxury goods market. Its famous Kelly bags, named after Princess Grace of
Monaco, take 20 hours to make by hand, and cost at least FFr14,500.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AEROSPATIALE, the French aircraft and missile making group, yesterday
provided the latest evidence of the recession in the world aerospace
industry by revealing a FFr2.38bn (Dollars 432m) net loss for last year.
This is significantly higher than the loss of up to FFr2bn the group was
forecasting only earlier this month, and reflects heavy restructuring costs
in its aeroplane and helicopter divisions. It compares with a FFr213m net
profit in 1991.
Aerospatiale said results would be better this year, and attributed the 1992
setback to airlines having to cancel or delay aircraft orders 'under the
weight of uncontrolled deregulation and a sluggish global economy'.
Shrinking military budgets hit defence orders, helicopter sales were
affected by a decline in industrial demand and the overall aerospace
business climate was worsened by a trade war initiated by the US, said the
French group.
Aerospatiale's sales climbed from FFr48.6bn to FFr52.3bn, representing a
rise of just 1.7 per cent on a fully comparable basis, on new orders
stagnant at FFr39bn.
Aircraft sales rose by 2.5 per cent, while helicopter sales fell by nearly
12 per cent and space and defence rose by 14.8 per cent. Aircraft
represented 42 per cent of turnover last year.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Cable TV group to seek phone licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of cable television companies operating throughout the UK is about
to apply to the government for a licence to offer personal communications
network (PCN) services.
Six cable TV investors want to offer mobile services in their areas, the
newspaper Communications Week International says.
If they are successful, it would be the cable operators' first entry to the
mobile communications market, and could lead to increased competition in a
mass market for low-cost pocket radio-telephones and related services.
The six companies - Comcast, Diamond Cable, General Cable, Nynex, Pacific
Telesis and Southwestern Bell - believe their existing networks will enable
them to provide mobile services quickly and relatively cheaply.
General Cable, a subsidiary of the French water utility Compagnie Generale
des Eaux, claims that it could make PCN services available within nine
months at competitive prices.
The Cable TV Association, which represents the companies, is urging the
government to give them the block of radio air space freed last year by the
merger of Mercury Personal Communications and Unitel.
Existing PCN licence holders Hutchison Telecom, Mercury One-2-One, Vodafone
and Cellnet are likely to oppose the granting of the licence, arguing that
it is not cost-effective to provide PCNs on a local basis.
The Department of Trade and Industry has yet to decide whether to issue new
PCN licenses.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Pondering a deal with 'astronomical' potential: Telegraph
directors meet today to discuss Southam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Conrad Black's business career has often taken surprising twists. But,
for some of those in London who follow his publicly quoted UK newspaper
group, The Telegraph, the sentiments aroused by his latest shift of tack go
well beyond surprise.
Last November, Mr Black's Canadian company Hollinger bought a 22.5 per cent
stake in Southam, a Canadian newspaper group, at a price of CDollars 18.10
per share, at the time a 15 per cent premium to the market price. Hollinger
has since offered The Telegraph half this stake, at the same price, at a
cost to the UK group of Pounds 72.3m.
The purchase was approved by The Telegraph's independent directors, ready
for a vote by shareholders. The majority of the shares in The Telegraph,
some 68 per cent, are owned by Mr Black's interests; but only outside
shareholders will vote on the deal. The shareholder vote was set for March
30.
Then came the twist. Last week, Power Corporation, the holding company of Mr
Paul Desmarais, the Canadian financier, agreed to buy new shares from
Southam at CDollars 14 each. That purchase will give Power an 18.7 per cent
stake in Southam, and dilute the Hollinger holding down to the same level.
Power and Hollinger also came to a shareholder agreement which would give
the two considerable influence over Southam.
To Mr Black, Southam is 'a classic corporate recovery', as he put it in a
letter in Monday's FT. It owns 17 newspapers, published in almost every main
Canadian city. It lost CDollars 153.2m in 1991 and CDollars 262.9m last
year, and has been struggling with borrowings which reached CDollars 665m in
1991.
But debt is being reduced. Power's investment in Southam is worth CDollars
180m and Southam is planning a CDollars 75m rights issue later this year,
which should leave the business virtually debt free. Mr Black argues the
business can be turned around. 'The upside could be astronomical,' he
enthuses.
Canadian analysts generally support Mr Black's assessment of Southam. 'They
have a wonderful franchise and they should be able to make money,' says Ms
Sue Scully, of Richardson Greenshields.
It is not quite a clear-cut issue, though. If Power and Hollinger work
together, they will have considerable influence over Southam. But if they
fall out the story could be different. Some in Toronto suspect Southam did
the deal with Power in order to reduce the influence of the
Hollinger/Telegraph axis.
Although Mr Black says in his FT letter that Hollinger and Power are
'long-standing corporate friends and on occasion allies' Mr Black and Mr
Desmarais have in the past also been rivals, notably in the fight over Argus
Corporation when Mr Black beat Mr Desmarais in a takeover battle.
Still, a number of Telegraph shareholders and analysts in London focus not
so much on the merits of the deal as on the way it has been handled.
On March 13 The Telegraph's independent directors sent a circular to
shareholders recommending a vote in favour of the share purchase, and a
meeting between directors of The Telegraph and analysts was held on
Wednesday March 17. It was on Tuesday or Wednesday, say those close to the
deal, that directors learnt of the proposed Power purchase and that
Hollinger was negotiating an agreement with Power.
The Hollinger/Power agreement was finalised last Thursday and Telegraph
shareholders heard about it the next day. The special meeting was postponed
until The Telegraph's independent directors could review the changed
circumstances, and meetings between the company and some shareholders were
postponed. The independent directors meet today to discuss their
recommendation.
The Telegraph is still being offered the shares at Dollars 18.10. It has the
option to sell the Southam shares back to Hollinger at CDollars 18.10 for
about a year, giving it what Mr Black calls an 'almost risk-free
opportunity'.
The 17 independent directors endorsed the deal 10 days ago. One says: 'We
looked at it before the arrival of Power Corporation on the scene and we
liked the idea then. The injection of new money into Southam might make it a
better deal.'
Some Telegraph shareholders complain, however, that Power is getting a
better deal still. Says one: 'It does not make sense to pay CDollars 18.10
for shares when others are buying at CDollars 14. It does not make sense for
us to support the transaction unless they can explain why it's a good deal.'
An independent director says: 'Mr Black said 'come in at my price or not at
all'. I don't think it's negotiable. If it's a good deal it (the price) will
come out in the wash.' Power's arrival offers another advantage, says Mr
Black. The agreement with Power, 'largely vacates the so-called 'poison
pill' arrangements which could have curtailed Hollinger's and The
Telegraph's ability to be a constructive influence at Southam'.
In the original circular, the Southam poison pill was described but the
potential restrictions on Hollinger's and The Telegraph's influence were not
emphasised. The circular said the holding proposed 'should enable The
Telegraph to influence the recovery of Southam'. At the time Mr Joe Cooke,
The Telegraph's managing director, said The Telegraph would have 'quite a
lot of influence' over Southam.
One institution which is a shareholder says it is unhappy with the Southam
deal. 'The attraction to us in the shares was The Telegraph itself, not the
rest,' said the fund manager. 'We did not buy shares in The Telegraph
because we thought Mr Black was a good punter in media shares.'
Another shareholder argues: 'Anyone who bought shares in The Telegraph knows
that he (Mr Black) is a substantial shareholder and has an acquisitive track
record. It's a case of the minority shareholders reviewing every deal put to
them.'
If The Telegraph's minority shareholders do not like the deal they can

themselves. They will have to choose between the benefits of Mr Black's
entrepreneurial style, and the occasional surprises to which it is likely to
give rise.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Banca di Roma in L102.5bn profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCA DI ROMA, Italy's biggest bank in terms of branches, reported pre-tax
profits of L102.5bn (Dollars 64.8m) last year. A direct comparison with 1991
is not possible as the bank represents the merger last August of the former
Banco di Roma with Banco di Santo Spirito, itself an amalgam of the latter
bank and the Cassa di Risparmio di Roma.
In spite of gross profits of L2,005bn - 9 per cent up on the 1991 figure for
Banco di Roma and Banco di Santo Spirito combined, the dividend is being
halved to L25 a share. Around 10 per cent of the bank's capital is floating.
Banca Commerciale Italiana, the state-controlled Italian bank which is to be
privatised, suffered its second consecutive year of sharply-falling net
profits with a 16.9 per cent drop to L263.8bn in 1992.
The reduction in earnings at parent bank level followed a 33 per cent slump
in 1991, However, the dividend again remains unchanged at L200 for ordinary
shares and L230 for savings stock.
BCI attributed its lower earnings to higher taxes and depreciation,
write-offs on securities and heavier provisioning for loan losses. Similar
factors are likely to push down earnings at most Italian banks this year.
Earnings at operating level showed an opposite tendency, with a 21.2 per
cent jump in gross profits to L1,380bn, due partly to careful cost control
matched by a slight decrease in staff numbers.
Continuing heavy investments in new branches, which increased the network by
60 units to 706 at the end of last year, contributed to a 10.9 per cent rise
in deposits to L92,736bn. Loans rose by 13.3 per cent to L85,339bn. At group
level, total assets last year went up to L131,000bn from L117,053bn in 1991.
Monte Dei Paschi di Siena, the Italian bank, is set to take majority control
of Sindibank, the small Spanish financial institution in which it bought a
minority holding in 1990.
Sindibank, controlled by the Fierro group, has 40 branches and is currently
stock market-listed. Monte dei Paschi plans to raise its stake to 57 per
cent from the current 33 per cent via a capital increase now under way.
That will be followed by a public tender offer for the remaining shares left
floating, after which Sindibank will be delisted.

FT  25 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC says US aircraft tax rules unfair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is expected to accuse the US next week of breaching
international civil aircraft trade rules by letting US manufacturers use a
controversial financing vehicle to avoid paying tax on aircraft sales.
The EC is threatening to take the issue before a General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade disputes panel.
After a series of renewed US attacks against government support for Airbus,
the EC is mounting a vigorous counter- attack on what it claims is
increasing administration support for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
The EC is especially concerned by the use of a US tax financing vehicle
called the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
More than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) worth of aircraft are estimated to have
been financed through this technique in the US.
Airbus says such tax benefits are not available to the European
manufacturer, and are an unfair export subsidy for the two US companies. 'We
will certainly press this issue during trade talks with the US in Brussels
next week,' said Mr Michel Dechelotte, Airbus director of international
affairs. He also said Airbus, with 95 order cancellations last year and a
further 20 last week, had been worse hit by the recession than Boeing.
Airbus partners have traditionally relied more heavily on direct support,
while US manufacturers have benefited from what the EC claims has been
significant indirect government support.
Mr Dechelotte said Airbus was worried the US intended to increase these
indirect supports to help its industry during the recession.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Change of image for stainless steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STAINLESS Steel Fabricators' Association, which represents 180 companies
in the UK stainless industry, has relaunched itself as the British Stainless
Steel Association as part of a new assault on the marketplace.
Mr Dick Wakelin, chairman of the association, said the change was more than
cosmetic. Many member companies are not fabricators; they are stockholders,
manufacturers, owners of foundries or involved with finishing.
The association says its main aim is to promote the use of stainless steel
in all its forms. Stainless is the only ferrous metal whose use in western
markets is predicted to grow this decade.
Through greater promotional activity, the association wants to increase the
use of stainless steel in the UK to be nearer that of Japan and other
leading industrialised countries. Japan uses 16kg per head per year while
the UK uses only 5kg.
The discovery of stainless steel was one of the world's first defence
industry spin-offs. Sheffield metallurgist Harry Brearley was examining the
excessive wear of rifle barrels and observed that steel with a high chromium
content would not rust.

FT  25 MAR 93 / People: Brooks extends her Sotheby's empire
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Diana Brooks, president and chief executive of Sotheby's North and South
America, has had her empire extended after her region did somewhat better
than the rest of the group in difficult conditions last year. She steps up
to the specially created position of president and chief executive officer
of Sotheby's, in charge of the auction house's business worldwide.
Michael Ainslie, 49, remains president and chief executive of Sotheby's
Holdings, the parent company of the auction, finance and real estate
operations. He explained that Brooks' promotion would enable him to spend
more time with major international clients and on strategic decisions, but
one analyst, who commented that the real substance of Ainslie's role
remained unclear, surmised that 43-year-old Brooks was now effectively chief
executive.
Whereas she used to report to Ainslie alongside Roger Faxon, managing
director of Sotheby's Europe, and Julian Thompson, chairman of Sotheby's
Asia, Faxon and Thompson now report to her. The other parts of the group
have underperformed America, and market share has been lost to Christie's,
the traditionally less aggressive rival. In 1992 Sotheby's pre-tax profits
fell from Dollars 21.5m to Dollars 6.49m.
A Yale graduate with a degree in American studies, Brooks joined Sotheby's
in 1979. Six years later she was made chief operating officer, before
becoming president of North and South America in 1987 and chief executive
officer in 1990. She has built herself a formidable reputation on both sides
of the Atlantic. 'Dede shoots from the hip and doesn't tend to miss,' says
one observer who has watched her in operation.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Finland's Outokumpu expands in
Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTOKUMPU, THE state-owned Finnish mining and metals group, is expanding its
interests in Australia by earning a majority stake in the Panorama zinc
project in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.
Shareholders in Sipa Resources, the small Australian company that owns the
project, are expected to give approval today for Outokumpu Zinc to earn 60
per cent of Panorama by spending ADollars 5m on exploration in the next two
years and then producing a bankable feasibility study. At the same time,
Outokumpu Zinc will buy ADollars 1.6m (Pounds 760,000) worth of Sipa shares,
which will take the Finnish group's stake from 14 per cent to 19.9 per cent.
Outokumpu Zinc operates Tara in Ireland, the biggest zinc-lead mine in
Europe, as well as an electrolytic plant in Finland. The company has been
interested in Panorama for some time and originally took a shareholding in
Burmin Exploration, a Dublin company, which owned 39 per cent of the
project. This stake had reached 25 per cent by the time Sipa recently merged
with Burmin in order to gain control of 100 per cent of Panorama. Sipa also
bought the remaining 10 per cent from Guardian Resources.
The Panorama project covers 3,000 square km (1,150 square miles) and Mr
Michael Doepel, Sipa's managing director, says the ADollars 4.5m spent on
exploration so far has been rewarded with the discovery of eight deposits.
'We have a base metals province which we hope will match some of the big
provinces in Canada,' he adds.
There is a long way to go, however. After two more years of exploration,
some ADollars 15m to Dollars 20m will have to be spent in the next two to
three years for the feasibility study. Construction of a mine would cost
about ADollars 200m and Outokumpu would be responsible for finding all the
project finance.
The Outokumpu group's other Australian interests include 100 per cent of the
Forrestania and 35 per cent of the Honeymoon Well nickel projects in Western
Australia, as well as 24 per cent of Lady Loretta and 25 per cent of
Thalanga, two base metals projects in Queensland.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Two senior analysts go in
Baring Japan move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BARING Securities Japan, Tokyo arm of the UK broker, has parted with two
senior analysts in a reorganisation of its research department, writes Emiko
Terazono from Tokyo.
The move follows the resignation earlier this month of Mr Christopher Heath
as chairman of Baring Securities after a disagreement over business strategy
with its parent company, the Barings banking and financial group.
Baring's Tokyo operation was one of the top performers among foreign houses
in Japan. But its dependence on client commissions in the weak Tokyo stock
market since 1990 has eroded profits. Almost 40 per cent of Baring
Securities' revenues are still linked to Japanese trading.
The number of staff at Baring's Tokyo operations has fallen from 240 in 1989
to 207, while the research team has declined from 32 to 25.
Mr Henry Antsey, an official at Baring's in Tokyo, denied the Tokyo branch
was restructuring, but said the company was trying to improve its research
product, and the latest losses resulted from differences in management
styles.
But Baring's new strategy of concentrating on emerging markets - such as
Singapore and Korea - has fueled speculation that the company may be
shifting away from Tokyo.
Norinchukin Bank, the central body for agricultural financial institutions,
plans to apply to set up a subsidiary to deal in securities once Japan's
financial reforms take effect on April 1, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The bank will capitalise the offshoot at between Y15bn (Dollars 127m) and
Y20bn. It will have a staff of about 40, which will double within a year.
Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Sumitomo Trust
and Banking have already announced plans to apply to the finance ministry to
set up securities arms.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sales drop 6% at Siemens Nixdorf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER at Siemens Nixdorf Informations-systeme, the lossmaking German
computer company owned by Siemens, dropped by 6 per cent to DM4.5bn (Dollars
2.76bn) in the first five months of its financial year.
Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig, chief executive, yesterday blamed troubled conditions
in the company's foreign markets for the drop, together with the upwards
valuation of the D-Mark, which accounted for one-third of the fall in
turnover in the five months to the end of February.
The sales downturn reflected poor conditions in Italy, Spain and France. In
the UK, however, order intake increased by 15 per cent in the five months.
Sales in Germany had remained virtually steady.
Mr Wiedig said the number of employees had fallen by 1,700 since the
beginning of the financial year and was set to drop by a further 3,200, to
around 44,000 by the end of the year. He did not comment directly yesterday
on the outlook for the company's profit and loss account.
In November last year, Siemens Nixdorf said it expected a further reduction
in losses in 1992-1993, after reporting a net deficit of DM513m in the year
to September, down by 34 per cent on 1990-1991.
Turnover for last year rose by 7 per cent to DM13bn.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Isosceles write-off helps push
A&amp;P to Dollars 189m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, the US supermarket operator in which
Germany's Tengelmann group holds a majority stake, reported a Dollars 189.5m
loss after tax in the year to February 27.
The loss contrasts with a Dollars 70.7m profit in the previous 12 months,
and comes on sales of Dollars 10.5bn, down from Dollars 11.6bn in 1991-92.
Much of the deficit is the result of a Dollars 151.2m write-off of A&amp;P's
investment in Isosceles, the UK company which bought out Gateway in a
leveraged deal, and a Dollars 90.1m charge related to accounting changes.
However, even at the operating level, A&amp;P posted sharply lower profits -
down from Dollars 203.9m in 1991-92, to Dollars 44.3m last year.
In the final quarter of the year, A&amp;P said it saw 'a reversal of the
company's previous sales decline, particularly in Canada'.
It added that it had begun 'its new financial year with an improving sales
and bottom-line performance'.
Nevertheless, the company still reported a Dollars 40.1m loss after tax in
the final three months, compared with a Dollars 16.1m profit in the same
period a year earlier.
The operating profit fell to Dollars 18.9m from Dollars 46.4m.
Final-quarter sales were Dollars 2.38bn, compared with Dollars 2.74bn.
Shawmut National, the US bank, is to acquire New Dartmouth Bank of
Manchester, New Hampshire, for about Dollars 143m in an exchange of stock,
agencies report.
The bank said that the deal was expected to increase its earnings per share
in the fourth quarter.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Reorganised Lex Service achieves sharp
improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLATILITY in pre-tax profits that can be caused by the new FRS 3
accounting standard was highlighted by Lex Service's results yester-day.
Under the new standard, the motor group turned a pre-tax loss of Pounds
50.1m in 1991 into a profit of Pounds 107m last year.
The big swing factors, giving a Pounds 63.7m profit, were the disposal (at a
goodwill-impacted loss) of electronics interests and the ending (for a large
amount of compensation) of its exclusive import agreement with Volvo.
Earnings per share came out at 96.7p compared with losses of 57.4p.
Under the old rules, with those transactions taken as extraordinary items,
pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 28.3m. Earnings were
30.2p (0.4p).
The main FRS 3 neutral figures were turnover, Pounds 910.7m (Pounds 1.32bn),
and the proposed increased final dividend of 6.6p (6p) to give a 10.6p (10p)
total.
The share price gained 16p to close at 335p.
Lex also signalled its ambitions by announcing the Pounds 13m purchase of 62
Autocentre servicing garages from Lucas Industries.
Sir Trevor Chinn, chairman and chief executive, said the group's other
targets included increasing the car dealership network from 90 to 120 sites
and doubling the size of the contract hire fleet to 100,000.
Lex's continuing motor retail business nearly doubled its trading profit
(before Pounds 6.7m of group overheads) to Pounds 12.4m with the help of
about Pounds 2m from Swan National, bought from the TSB Group last May.
Leasing companies, all joint ventures with Lombard North Central - part of
National Westminster Bank, contributed Pounds 9.6m to pre-tax profit as
associates.
Lex Vehicle Leasing turned from a Pounds 3.6m loss to a Pounds 6.5m profit,
benefiting from rationalisation and lower interest charges.
Truck leasing was also turned round and the forklift trucks side showed
strong growth.
Lex retains a 17.5 per cent stake in Arrow Electronics of the US. This
contributed Pounds 9.5m.
The market value of the stake rose to Pounds 94m compared with a book value
of Pounds 37m.
Net debt fell from Pounds 56.9m to Pounds 8.7m.
Lex's half share of off balance sheet debt in the leasing companies amounted
to about Pounds 200m.
COMMENT
Lex now claims to have the biggest UK dealership network, overtaking
Inchcape and Octav Botnar's AFG. Yet a swathe of ambitions lie ahead of it,
including the service chain started with the latest buy. Its aims on the
dealership/leasing fronts echo those of T Cowie and they may be bumping up
against each other as they scan the motor activities of much larger groups.
Continued recovery in all parts of Lex's business, which hit bottom in 1991
when the dividend was cut, should more than compensate for losing the
residue of the Volvo import profits. A pre-tax profit of Pounds 34m
(assuming no lumpy deals) gives a prospective p/e of about 14. After
outperforming the market by a third in the past six months, most of the good
news is in the price.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Sharp deterioration at Norwegian
shipowner

<TEXT>
I. M. SKAUGEN, the shipowner that is listed on the Norwegian bourse,
reported a sharp deterioration in 1992 pre-tax losses to NKr563m (Dollars
81m) from NKr183m.
The company said the weak performance reflected the completion of a major
turnround of the group, which aims to reduce financial and operational risks
and debt.
Gross freight revenue was halved last year, to NKr1.2bn from NKr2.4bn a year
earlier, due to weak markets and a reduction in the fleet. Net financial
items rose to NKr112m, from NKr87m.
I. M. Skaugen said debt had been reduced by about NKr1bn to NKr826m, of
which NKr652m was long-term debt. It said the winding up of former
activities was not yet complete, but outstanding assets and liabilities were
relatively minor.
Administration costs were reduced by half to NKr271m.
I. M. Skaugen last year transformed itself from a diversified shipowner to
an owner and operator of petrochemical gas carriers. It established
Norwegian Gas Carriers to cover this activity. It forecast continued
weakness in the petrochemical gas carrier market in 1993, mainly due to
profitability problems in the west European petrochemicals industry.

The contract exceeds the amount of total foreign orders that Hyundai

PORTUGAL yesterday announced an Es300bn (Dollars 2bn) package designed to
support exports and help industry through the international recession, Peter
Wise reports from Lisbon. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, said the
aim was to help exporters penetrate non-traditional markets, to promote
Portuguese products in specific markets and to support companies hit by
exchange-rate instability and the crisis in the former Soviet Union.
Credit lines worth Esc270bn will be opened at Portuguese banks during the
next six months to support exports to 13 non-traditional markets including
Israel, South Africa, China, Iran and some Latin American and East European
countries.

<TEXT>
JAPAN hit back yesterday against strong criticism of its trading practices
by President Bill Clinton.
The US leader's statement on Tuesday that the prospect of gaining fair
access to the Japanese market was 'somewhat remote' was based on a
misunderstanding of that market, said Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister
for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
'His understanding of the Japanese market is wrong,' Mr Hatakeyama told the
FT. Japan was the largest market for US agricultural products and the second
largest for US manufactured goods. If Japanese markets were really difficult
to access, this could not be the case.
President Clinton's statement that the trade imbalance with Japan was the
only one that did not seem to change very much was also untrue, said Mr
Hatakeyama. Japan's imports from the US had increased in value from Dollars
48.2bn in 1989 to Dollars 52.1bn last year.
It was not appropriate to compare Japan's trade surplus with the situation
in other countries since there was a difference in competitiveness, Mr
Hatakeyama said. Japan was more competitive than other US trading partners.
The minister repeated the Japanese government's rejection of the US
suggestion that it should set market share targets as a measurement of
access. 'We are working in a free market which cannot be changed by
artificial means,' he said. The US-Japan trade balance should be improved
through efforts to reduce the US budget deficit and raise US
competitiveness, in the government's view.
Mr Hatakeyama welcomed President Clinton's decision not to act unilaterally
by raising US tariffs on minivans from 2.5 per cent to 25 per cent but to
address the issue 'in the context of of a larger set of trade issues'.
Raising the tariff would have been a breach of Gatt rules.
Further Japanese steps to open its markets and expand domestic demand were
promised yesterday by Mr Yohei Kono, chief cabinet secretary. The issue
would be addressed by Mr Yoshiro Mori, trade minister, during his visit to
Washington later this week, he said.
Mr Kono pointed out, however, that the surplus has grown even though the
volume of imports into Japan had not fallen. This was in part due to the
rise in the value of the yen.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN will make only a slow recovery from its current economic crisis,
Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the country's leading commercial bank, warned
yesterday, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
The bank expects the country's GDP to fall 1.5 per cent in 1993, the third
successive year of decline, while recovering only a weak 0.7 per cent next
year.
Government estimates in January suggested a 1.4 per cent drop in GDP this
year, but a stronger 1.6 per cent growth next year.
The bank also predicts inflation this year will rise to 5.7 per cent,
exceeding the 5 per cent level on which most government forecasts are based,
following the sharp depreciation of the krona.
Two of the country's main economic problems - unemployment and the budget
deficit - are set to get worse, warns the bank.

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Poland's seven-party coalition led by Ms Hanna Suchocka could
hang on the result of a no-confidence vote in Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the
privatisation minister.
Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the minister responsible for European Community
affairs and Mr Lewandowski's party colleague, said yesterday that his group,
the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD), would leave the government if Mr
Lewandowski failed to survive the vote.
The motion has been brought by the anti-communist KPN party, which espouses
populist policies and has been pushing for Mr Lewandowski's resignation
since last autumn.
The KPN's move follows the defeat last week of Mr Lewandowski's mass
privatisation plan, with subsequent party inquiries suggesting that a
no-confidence vote might succeed. Next week's vote will coincide with the
government's resubmission of revised privatisation proposals.
Mr Bielecki's statement is aimed at bolstering Mr Lewandowski's position
within the coalition and in effect turns the vote into a vote of confidence
in the government.
The coalition controls about 210 votes in the 460-member Sejm and relies for
its majority on the 26-strong Solidarity trade union group and a handful of
independents.
The KLD and its close allies have 52 votes in the Sejm. Were they to
withdraw, the alternative would be the imposition of a cabinet by President
Lech Walesa or new elections. The KLD is hoping that most parties want to
avoid both.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Aviation Authority, the government agency responsible for
airline safety issues, yesterday confirmed that it was investigating
allegations of maintainence irregularities at USAir, the US carrier into
which British Airways recently invested Dollars 300m for a potential 19.9
per cent stake.
The FAA said that the irregularities were alleged to have occured at the
company's Indianapolis maintainence base. It declined to discuss the
situation further while the investigation is continuing. However, the
charges are thought to involve the signing-off on maintainence records for
repairs which were not done.
The FAA also acknowledged that it had looked into a second incident last
year, at Charlotte, North Carolina, where USAir has a 'hub' airport
operation. The US agency said that one USAir maintainence supervisor had his
licence suspended for 180 days as a result of the Charlotte incident, which
occured on May 29. The pilot involved in the same situation also had his
licence suspended for 30 days. The FAA added, however, that it found 'no
reason' to take any action against the airline itself.
USAir said last night that none of the alleged irregularities at
Indianapolis related to air safety. It added that, as a result of this
episode, it had conducted an internal investigation and believed 'the
activity was confined to two individuals and isolated to one facility -
Indianapolis'.
Mr Lewis Jordan has resigned as president and chief operating officer of
Continental Airlines, the fifth-largest US carrier which is expected to
emerge from bankruptcy shortly.
Meanwhile, Continental, which recently cancelled orders for 20 Airbus jets,
is still holding discussions with Seattle-based Boeing over future
deliveries of new aircraft.

AMDAHL, the US computer systems company, saw its share price tumble, by
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 6 1/2 , after a profits warning, Reuter reports.
The company said it expected next month to report a first-quarter loss
'substantially larger' than analysts' average estimates. The company
declined to estimate the size of the projected loss for the period, to March
26, but a survey of analysts' estimates suggested a loss of 3 cents per
share. Amdahl attributed the shortfall in earnings to price competition and
erratic demand.

<TEXT>
BERLITZ, the language school and publishing company once controlled by the
late Robert Maxwell, said yesterday it had a Dollars 3.9m, or 21 cents per
share, loss in the fourth quarter of 1992.
The result, while much improved on the Dollars 189.5m, or Dollars 9.97 per
share, loss in the last quarter of 1991, was affected by a Dollars 1.4m
charge related to the acquisition of majority control of Berlitz by
Fukutake, the Japanese publishing group. That deal, which gives Fukutake 67
per cent of Berlitz, was completed on February 8.
In the last quarter of 1991, Berlitz suffered from a Dollars 195.4m charge
related to write-offs and reserve caused by the bankruptcy of the Maxwell
Communication Corporation.
Sales in the last quarter of 1992 were Dollars 70.8m, up from Dollars 66.5m
a year before. Sales for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 281.3m, against
Dollars 259.8m in 1991. Berlitz said net profit for the whole of last year
was Dollars 4m, against a loss of Dollars 172m in 1991.
Translation sales for the fourth quarter of last year were 19.6 per cent
higher at Dollars 7.9m. Publishing sales were Dollars 4.9m, up from Dollars
4.5m a year before. Instruction sales were 4.8 per cent better in the
quarter at Dollars 58m.
After the Fukutake share deal Berlitz has long-term indebtedness of Dollars
115m. Mr Soichiro Fukutake, new chairman of Berlitz, said the two companies
could become 'a global powerhouse' in education and language services.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bank of America considers
acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK of America, the leading California bank which last year acquired
Security Pacific, yesterday indicated it was considering new acquisitions.
The bank said so in a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) to raise up to Dollars 3bn of new funds.
The filing said the proceeds would finance possible future acquisitions, to
repay maturing obligations and for general corporate purposes.
The bank said the Dollars 3bn might be raised through the issue of debt
securities, debt warrants, preferred stock, depository shares, preferred
stock warrants, common stock warrants and common stock.
Mr Dick Rosenberg, chairman of Bank of America, has had his eye on a series
of out-of-state acquisitions that would broaden the bank's presence
nationally. But Wall Street analysts have been sceptical about the bank's
ability to make new deals until it has fully integrated the former Security
Pacific's operations and absorbed problem loans that came with the
acquisition.
The bank's stock yesterday closed at Dollars 49 7/8, down Dollars 1 1/8.

<TEXT>
SHARES in International Business Machines fell sharply in New York yesterday
afternoon, apparently as a result of growing concern about pricing pressures
on the computer-makers's mainframe business.
IBM's stock closed Dollars 3 1/8 lower at Dollars 51 1/8 on heavy trading of
more than 3.2m shares. IBM said its policy was not to comment on the stock's
activity.
Traders said investors also appeared disappointed by reports that Mr Louis
Gerstner, chairman of RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco company, had
emerged as a leading candidate for the top job at IBM amid rising
speculation that IBM could shortly name a new chief executive officer.
Mr Michael Metz, an analyst at Oppeneimer, said: 'My guess is there's a lot
of scepticism on whether (Mr Gerstner) can do the job.'
RJR Nabisco declined to comment on reports of Mr Gerstner's impending
departure yesterday. IBM also declined to comment on reports that Mr
Gerstner has had several meetings with IBM's selection committee of
non-executive directors. The committee was formed in January when Mr John
Akers, IBM chairman and chief executive, said he would step down as chief
executive following IBM's announcement of Dollars 4.9bn losses for 1992, its
second consecutive annual loss.
Under US securities laws, IBM has to make an announcement as soon as it has
made a final selection and reached contractual arrangements. The lack of
such an announcement suggests no final decision has been made.
Other potential candidates, including Mr John Sculley of Apple Computer, Mr
Larry Bossidy of Allied-Signal and Mr George Fisher of Motorola, have issued
statements saying they would not take the job.
The selection of Mr Gerstner would suggest that IBM's board has decided the
company needs stronger financial controls rather than new technology
leadership, since Mr Gerstner has no experience in the computer industry.
He was named as chief executive of RJR Nabisco in March 1989, shortly after
the record Dollars 25bn leveraged buyout of the food and tobacco giant.
Then 47, he moved to the company from American Express, which he had joined
in 1978 as president of the card division, and risen to become chairman of
the executive committee of the parent company in 1983, and then president in
1985.
Mr Gerstner has no direct prior ties to IBM, but his brother, Mr Richard
Gerstner, is a former IBM senior executive. He retired recently for health
reasons.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Threats mar Maastricht victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO FRESH threats to the passage of the Maastricht bill emerged yesterday on
an evening which ended on a high note for the government, when it won a
procedural vote to extend debate on the measure into the small hours.
One setback came from Labour, which tabled a new amendment that could force
the government to choose between accepting the social chapter and being
unable to ratify the treaty.
The second occurred when it emerged that Tory Euro-sceptics received legal
advice at a meeting on Tuesday which encouraged them to seek judicial review
of the attorney-general's opinion about the impact of a separate Labour
amendment.
Last month, Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, surprised MPs by
contradicting Foreign Office lawyers' advice that accepting the amendment,
which excludes the social chapter from the bill, would wreck the treaty. If
the amendment is passed, the Tory rebels are now determined to challenge his
view.
The new Labour amendment would prevent the ratification bill coming into
force until the Commons had decided whether the social chapter should apply
to the UK. This would mean a separate debate after the bill completed its
parliamentary passage.
The government's morale boost came when the support of 17 Liberal Democrats
helped it to a comfortable majority of 17 (296 votes to 279) on a division
to extend the 17th day of detailed Commons discussion of the bill beyond
10pm.
A total of 26 Tory rebels, five Ulster Unionists, two Scottish Nationalists
and one Lib Dem voted with Labour against the extension.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the European affairs minister, said: 'We remain on
course to complete the committee and report stages before the Danish
referendum (May 18) and take the third reading immediately afterwards.'
Labour is confident that its new clause on the social chapter is within
Westminster's procedural rules.
The decision about whether the Commons should debate it rests with Mr
Michael Morris, the deputy Speaker.
It would, however, be a tortuous process to reach the point at which the
government had to choose between not going ahead with Maastricht and
adopting the social chapter.
To get there, Tory Euro-sceptics would have to vote explicitly for the
social chapter - which they do not support - in the hope that ministers'
vehement opposition to the chapter would mean that the government would
prefer not ratifying to adopting it.
But if that were the choice, the government would come under severe pressure
from many Tory backbenchers to accept the social chapter rather than wreck
the treaty.
That is because they believe more jobs would be lost through a fall in
inward investment if the UK did not sign up to Maastricht than would be lost
because of the impact of the social chapter.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Clothing trade deficit 'at peak'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S trade deficit in clothing and textiles reached a record Pounds
3.8bn in 1992, almost one third of the total trade deficit, a report says
today.
Imports rose 7 per cent to Pounds 8.6bn as overseas manufacturers took
advantage of the strength of sterling before it left the European exchange
rate mechanism in September, says the report from the Apparel Knitting and
Textiles Alliance, the industry body.
The strongest rise in imports was in clothing - 18 per cent up in the final
quarter compared with 1991. But the orders for those deliveries were placed
before sterling's fall.
Exports rose more slowly than imports but nevertheless reached a record of
Pounds 4.8bn, up 6 per cent on 1991. Germany remains the biggest market for
UK clothing and textiles with sales of Pounds 580m, slightly lower than in
1991.
The report was optimistic on the long-term effects of the weakness of
sterling. 'UK producers' scope for import substitution has improved, and
there is potential for further increases in exports once overseas markets
have recovered from recession,' it said.
Clothing sales will recover more quickly than general consumer spending,
says a report published today by the Economist Intelligence Unit.
The recovery will push sales growth to 3.6 per cent in 1995, the report
says.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Blockade threat as fish talks fail
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERMEN'S leaders yesterday threatened further blockades of UK ports in
protest at the European Community's fisheries policy.
The fresh warning came after talks between the National Federation of
Fishermen's Organisations and Mr David Curry, the fisheries minister, ended
in apparent deadlock. Mr Curry rejected calls for import controls,
particularly on cheap Russian fish. He said recent falls in prices had been
caused by oversupply from British boats and not by cheap imports, and UK
prices were now rising.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Swansea barrage completed
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWANSEA yesterday marked the completion of a river barrage, the first such
barrage in the UK, with a campaign to promote the way in which the city is
changing its legacy of industrial dereliction.
The barrage, built at a cost of Pounds 17m with Pounds 6.5m coming from the
European regional development fund, is at the mouth of the river Tawe. At
low tide the river has been a muddy eyesore.
Water is now retained by the barrage for four miles upstream, improving its
appearance and, the council hopes, its attraction to developers which it is
seeking for 23 sites near the river.
Locks allow boats to enter a 600-berth marina at all states of the tide, and
a fish ladder enables fish to swim upstream to spawn. Seals have already
been observed above the fish pass.
The barrage, which has to cope with a tidal range of 8.6 metres, one of the
highest in the world, also generates up to 100kw of electricity for the
national grid.

INDEPENDENT factoring companies, which provide clients with cash against
their invoices and other credit management services, should be more closely
regulated, the larger of the industry's two professional bodies said
yesterday.
The statement follows the collapse last month of London and Provincial
Factors, which was not a member of the Association of British Factors and
Discounters, the body which represents the large factors. All 11 members of
the business are owned by banks.
Many of London and Provincial's clients stand to lose much of the money they
are owed and are facing collapse.
The Bank of England should ensure that factors are financed properly and
that they do not use clients' invoices as security for bank loans, the
association said.

<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, yesterday accused the El
Salvador authorities ofreneging on a UN-brokered peace settlement by
granting amnesty for crimes committed in the 12-year civil war.
The UN chief chided President Alfredo Cristiani for failing to fulfil a
pledge to send an envoy to New York with a timetable for implementing
proposals published last week by a three-member international commission.
The commission called for the removal of 15 senior military officers cited
as among the worst violators of human rights, including General Rene Emilio
Ponce, the defence minister.
The army high command is incensed and says it will offer a legal challenge
to the report. The US has told Mr Cristiani it will not release further
military aid until the purge is completed.

</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S political parties have emerged as rich men in beggar's clothing from
the publication of their annual accounts.
According to the formal accounts of the 14 main parties published yesterday
in the official gazette, their combined revenues added up to only L285bn
(Pounds 122m) in 1991 against declared expenses of L293bn. However, their
accumulated debts at the end of 1991 totalled L108bn.
The accounts have been published after having been sent back to the
respective party treasurers for clarification in the light of the current
corruption scandals. Even so, they differ widely from the picture being made
public by businessmen and state company managers who have admitted to paying
bribes and illicit contributions to the parties over recent years.
On the basis of these confessions and the generalised nature of illicit
party funding known to exist, official contributions in 1991 would appear to
represent little more than 10 per cent of the real monies collected in the
parties' names. Illicit funding of overblown party infrastructures and
lavish spending lies at the heart of the magistrates' investigations into
corruption.
In theory, all contributions over L5m have to be declared, yet very few such
contributions are listed.
Another senior member of the Fiat group has been caught up in the corruption
investigations. Yesterday magistrates revealed that a cautionary warrant
alleging corruption had been issued against Mr Riccardo Ruggeri, the
London-based chief executive of New Holland, the agricultural machinery
concern.

<TEXT>
GERMAN steel employers and unions have failed to find a compromise to avert
a strike in eastern Germany next month.
Inconclusive talks were held this week between IG Metall, Germany's giant
engineering union, and the steel employers association. The union is
insisting on a 21 per cent pay increase for its 20,000 steel union members
in eastern Germany, as part of a March 1991 contract. The employers have
offered 9 per cent.
IG Metall said yesterday it would start balloting members in eastern Germany
on a strike, although one senior official conceded that the union 'did not
really want a strike' in eastern Germany.
Small and medium-sized enterprises did not want a strike, he said, nor could
they pay their employees a 26 per cent rise. However, it was time 'the
workers in eastern Germany learned to defend their interests. After 50
years, they have forgotten how to strike.'

FT  25 MAR 93 / Airlift of Bosnia wounded halted by Serb shelling

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH and British helicopters, which yesterday started to evacuate Moslem
civilians from the besieged enclave of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia, were
forced to suspend their operations a few hours later because of heavy Serb
shelling of the town.
The mission was halted shortly after two British helicopters had evacuated
two Canadian soldiers of the United Nations peacekeeping force who had been
wounded by Serb gunfire. Earlier, Serb shells had killed a civilian only
minutes after three French helicopters had taken off with 21 wounded Moslems
on board.
Altogether, three people were killed and at least six, including the two
Canadians, were wounded in the shelling of the town.
The British Sea King helicopters had flown into Srebrenica under fire but
were able to leave unharmed, in spite of the fact that the Serb bombardment
appeared to be deliberately directed at the town football pitch which was
being used as the landing zone. The Serb action was described as 'the
ultimate in despicable behaviour' by Brigadier Roddy Cordy-Simpson, the
British chief-of-staff at the UN Bosnia command. UN officials immediately
lodged a stiff protest with the Serb military, which had undertaken to
observe a ceasefire to allow the airlift to succeed.
Srebrenica has been under siege from the Serbs since the beginning of the
Bosnian civil war last April and, earlier this month, inhabitants were
reported by UN officials to be dying at the rate of 30 a day.
Under a deal worked out by General Philippe Morillon, the French UN
commander, Serb leaders had authorised the evacuation of sick and wounded
people on condition that 46 Serb inhabitants of Tuzla, a Moslem-held town in
northern Bosnia, would also be evacuated.
The Serb forces are only a few kilometres away from Srebrenica and it is
feared that they are preparing for a final assault.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Barclays to look worldwide for chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS is embarking on a worldwide search for a new chief executive from
outside the bank, it was announced yesterday.
Mr Andrew Buxton, who became chairman and chief executive in January, has
asked a group of directors to find a chief executive after sustained
pressure from institutional investors for the roles to be split.
The appointment of an outsider is a significant change for the bank, which
this month announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 242m and halved its final
dividend. Although it has reformed its promotion policy, most of its
chairmen - including Mr Buxton - have been members of families whose banks
merged to form it 96 years ago.
Sir Denys Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries and a
non-executive director of Barclays, said the group would ask a company of
headhunters to find 'someone with a good track record, who is experienced,
and is an established agent of change'.
Sir Denys, who will lead the group of five non-executive directors, said
Barclays would probably appoint a senior manager of a bank or a financial
services company, but might consider an 'outstanding' candidate from
elsewhere.
He said the group would meet for the first time next week, and was already
screening headhunters. 'There are some very competent people in Barclays,
but just at this juncture someone from outside is needed to take a fresh
look,' he said. 'I believe it is the right thing to do, as does the whole
board. This is not a cosmetic exercise to get institutional investors off
the bank's back.'
Sir Denys said he hoped the search would be completed within months,
although it would be a difficult task. 'I would like to do it as quickly as
we can but it is not going to be that easy. There are not that many
candidates,' he said.
Although Mr Buxton announ-ced in January that he would split his
responsibilities, some investors were concerned that the bank might only
appoint a chief operating officer, and that Mr Buxton would prefer an
internal promotion.
The announcement that Barclays will look outside rules out internal
contenders such as Mr Alastair Robinson, head of Barclays' banking division,
and Mr David Band, the chief executive of the BZW investment banking
subsidiary.
Among the British candidates the bank might consider are Mr Brian Pearse,
the bank's former finance director and now chief executive of Midland Bank,
and Mr John Melbourn, head of credit risk at National Westminster Bank. Sir
Peter Middleton, Barclays' deputy chairman, will be a member of the search
group. Its other members will be Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ, Sir
Martin Jacomb, chairman of Postel, and Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of Slough
Estates.
Institutional investors who have expressed discontent about the bank's
management welcomed the move, but some shareholders made clear that they are
concerned at the length of service of several of the bank's non-executive
directors.
One shareholder said he was concerned that non-executives had backed Mr
Buxton's appointment to both roles last sum-mer.
He was also worried that non-executives had failed to raise objections to
Barclays' lending growth in the late 1980s.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff in yesterday's profits
warning from Merck. If profits at the largest US pharmaceutical company are
being squeezed by government regulation and price-sensitive customers, the
rest of the sector will surely suffer. The market's knee-jerk response in
marking down Wellcome and Glaxo then looks correct. But to the extent that
Merck's earnings are damaged by a strong dollar - around half its sales are
made outside the US - UK pharmaceutical companies actually stand to benefit.
There is also the nagging suspicion that companies like Merck might seek to
blame the poor performance of specific drugs on wider industry trends. The
fine print in its first-quarter figures will make more interesting reading
than usual.

FT  25 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK coal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However hard the government struggles, it seems unable to produce a black
and white plan for the future of the coal industry. Indeed, if the smoke
signals are to be believed, the past few weeks have been spent hammering out
the final details of the basic coal contract with the electricity companies
which was supposed to have been agreed last September. That deal by itself
will not save any of the threatened pits. And while the generators are, in
principle, happy to take some extra coal, provided that it is at world
market prices, they have not yet agreed to do so.
The government thus has to produce a proposal to subsidise coal without firm
commitments from the generators. It seems likely to underwrite the
production of an extra 12m-15m tonnes for the next two years, reprieving
around 11 pits. But they will have to cut costs to world prices in that time
if they are to survive. Another half dozen pits may be mothballed to make up
the numbers. A few may even be sold off to contractors who would rip cheap
coal out as quickly as possible, and then close the mines. Given that
British Coal has failed to cut its costs fast enough in the past three
years, it is tempting to assume that the government is only postponing part
of the agony. Yet 19m tonnes of coal were imported to the UK last year, so
there is a potential market, at least, for some of the threatened output.
Meanwhile, the generators, National Power and PowerGen, seem to have faced
down Mr Heseltine and his threats of legislation. The recent run-up of their
shares to all-time highs thus looks justified. After this debacle, any
enthusiasm for an early monopolies and mergers inquiry into the generation
duopoly must have wilted.

FT  25 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Kingfisher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kingfisher's decision to extend its everyday low pricing policy at B&amp;Q looks
like the market leader tightening the screw on the competition. The timing,
just ahead of the crucial Easter trading period, is certainly tactical. But
the strategy depends upon longer term performance improvements which the
others will find hard to match. Texas may find a refuge in the softer home
furnishings and decoration area. Do It All has nowhere to run. Only the high
costs of exit will prolong the agony.
Kingfisher's other big idea is Europe. The Darty acquisition is proof of
this commitment, but the proposition still seems suspect. If markets are
becoming increasingly similar, then how can Darty's high margins in France
be squared with Comet's weaker showing in the UK? Any convergence seems
likely to be in the direction of lower, not higher margins.

FT  25 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Joe Darby, Lasmo's new chief executive, deserves credit for cutting the
dividend. Last year's Pounds 80m pay-out, including the write-off of advance
corporation tax, was too high for a loss-making company with Pounds 1bn
debt. Yet the 2.5 per cent yield on the shares is hard to square with
Lasmo's modest growth prospects. That the Markham gas field is now on the
block suggests divestment is eating into core assets. With exploration
spending cut again this year, Lasmo will be hard-pressed to replace oil now
being drilled with new reserves.
The Liverpool Bay gas project should deliver good profits in the second half
of the decade - assuming the government's energy review does not block the
power projects on which it depends. That may limit the downside. In the
meantime, Lasmo looks like a high-cost producer without the financial muscle
to compete with the best. Without a sustained rise in the oil price, a fresh
injection of equity looks the only way to restore financial balance. Raising
US preference capital may provide a partial solution. Having disappointed
the UK stock market on so many occasions, though, Lasmo cannot count on the
real thing.

FT  25 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Cashing in at Reuters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reuters' ruminations about whether to distribute some of its Pounds 710m
cash mountain to shareholders again arouses the suspicion that it may be
running out of growth. If Reuters concludes its shareholders can use the
cash more advantageously than it can, it would be tacitly admitting that
future expansion was at least limited. This, though, would be a rather
unkind interpretation of a commendable instinct.
The temptation for companies with strong cash flows is to make acquisitions.
The result has often been foolhardy diversification which has diluted
returns. So far, Reuters has shown restraint. The company certainly plans
modest purchases in related areas. It also lifted its capital expenditure
last year by a quarter to almost Pounds 200m. Even so, Reuters is likely to
continue throwing off surplus cash. As interest rates fall, it becomes more
pressing to consider how to use it.
The theory of distribution is fine. But the practicalities are fraught with
complexity. A special dividend would be one option. The drawback is that
shareholders would benefit to varying degrees depending on their tax
position. Moreover, Reuters' shareholders have traditionally looked for
capital appreciation, not yield. A share repurchase scheme may be
preferable, despite the difficulty of coping with different regulatory and
tax regimes in the UK and US. Several other companies, ranging from GEC to
BT, face actual or incipient problems of surplus cash. It would be nice if
Reuters could publish a solution on its wires.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Polluted land register proposal dropped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS for a register of contaminated land have been abandoned after
'substantial criticism', the government confirmed last night after weeks of
speculation.
A 'new wide ranging review' examining how local authorities might play a
greater part in tackling problems of land pollution would replace the
register, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said.
Property developers and surveyors welcomed the move, arguing that
implementation of the proposals would have caused blight of property values
across the country, including up to a third of the Midlands.
However, they criticised the lack of a new policy to tackle the issue of
polluted land. Mr Michael Chambers of the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors said: 'We were expecting a firm announcement at this stage. This
is rather a disappointment.'
Proposals for the registers, which were part of the 1990 Environmental
Protection Act, were abandoned after two public inquiries.
The Department of the Environment said yesterday that it had responded to
three main criticisms:
The registers would have listed potential not actual contamination as they
included all sites which had been used at some point in the past by
specified types of industry.
There would have been no way of removing sites from the register even if
contamination had been cleared.
It was not clear who should carry the liability and costs of cleaning up
contamination.
Mr Howard said: 'The government remains determined that contamination does
not give rise to unacceptable risks to health and safety, to ground water
and the environment.
'Local authorities will still have their long-standing statutory powers to
find and deal with actual pollution and to decide planning issues about
contamination.'
The new review will look at whether local authorities' powers and financial
resources are adequate.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary, said: 'We seem to be getting
yet a third round of consultation. The entire burden of assessing whether
land is fit for development will now fall on local authorities.' He was
sceptical that all would be capable of that task.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Belgium raises rates to protect franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM'S central bank was forced to raise official interest rates yesterday
to support the franc after the resignation of the coalition government
triggered strong selling of the currency inside the European exchange rate
mechanism.
Belgian government bonds and share prices also came under pressure as
financial markets remained uncertain about the future of the country's
fragile ruling coalition and its commitment to reducing the looming budget
deficit. King Baudouin was consulting senior politicians on whether to
accept the resignation of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, and his
centre-left coalition.
Mr Dehaene offered to resign on Tuesday night after coalition partners
failed to agree on how to bring the country's budget deficit into line with
the economic criteria for European economic and monetary union set out in
the Maastricht treaty.
The Belgian national bank raised its central interest rate from 8 per cent
to 8.5 per cent and its end-of-day rate from 9 per cent to 10 per cent to
protect the Belgian franc as the currency weakened against the D-Mark.
Belgium's central bank has an informal commitment to peg its currency
closely to the D-Mark to underline its commitment to monetary union. The
rate rises triggered support for the Belgian franc, which closed unchanged
on the day at BFr20.62 against the D-Mark.
The BEL-20 index of Belgium's largest stocks slipped by 9.41, less than 1
per cent, to 1,246.91, and the yield on government bonds opened higher and
changed little during the day.
Mr Dehaene, a Flemish Christian Democrat, insists that all four government
parties - Socialists and Christian Democrats from both sides of Belgium's
language divide - are committed to reducing the deficit. Political analysts
suggested he had offered to resign because he wanted to make all four
parties realise the potential gravity of the dispute.
The king is thought most likely to refuse the resignation offer and insist
that the coalition partners reach a compromise on budget measures, which are
aimed at raising BFr110bn (Pounds 2.3bn). But opposition parties called for
new elections as soon as possible.

FT  25 MAR 93 / South Africa admits it produced nuclear arms: Weapons were
dismantled in 1989, de Klerk says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA admitted yesterday that it had developed and produced nuclear
weapons in the late 1970s. President FW de Klerk said, however, that such
weapons were dismantled after he took power in 1989.
In a statement to parliament in Cape Town, Mr de Klerk provided the first
confirmation of what international atomic experts had long suspected: that
South Africa had produced weapons-grade uranium and used it to produce a
nuclear bomb.
Mr de Klerk said he took the decision to dismantle the weapons soon after
becoming president in September 1989, in an apparent attempt to prevent
nuclear weapons and technology falling into the hands of a future black
government dominated by the African National Congress.
He came under heavy pressure to wind up South Africa's weapons programme
from the US and other foreign governments concerned at the ANC's links with
Col Muammer Gadaffi of Libya. South Africa's six nuclear fission warheads
were dismantled early in 1990, and the nuclear material used to produce them
was downgraded so that it could no longer be used for weapons.
Mr de Klerk said all hardware and design information used in the bombs'
construction was also destroyed - again, to frustrate attempts by a future
government to revive a nuclear weapons industry - although many of those who
developed the weapons remain in government employ.
He insisted that South Africa had developed the weapons entirely with
domestic technology, and that it neither imported nor exported technology or
materials. There has long been speculation that South Africa co-operated
with Israel on its nuclear weapons programme.
In July 1991, South Africa acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
under which it was required to declare its uranium stockpiles to the
International Atomic Energy Agency. Mr de Klerk said yesterday that South
Africa held no further stocks of weapons-grade uranium. In Vienna, the IAEA
said it would send inspectors to verify that the nuclear programme had
ended.
The airborne warheads were constructed at a cost of R800m (Pounds 170m)
after a decision in 1974 to launch a nuclear weapons programme aimed at
deterrence, Mr de Klerk said. The plan was to make their existence known to
the US if Soviet military expansion in southern Africa threatened South
Africa, he said.
Under further pressure from the US, it is understood the government will
soon terminate a separate programme to develop launch vehicles for space
satellites - long viewed as a smokescreen for a ballistics missile
programme.
George Graham reports from Washington: Mr de Klerk's announcement seems
likely to clear up a dispute with the IAEA and the US about whether South
Africa was accounting in full for its production of nuclear material.
'I think this is just the kind of thing South Africa should have done and
North Korea may yet have to do,' said Mr Gary Milhollin, an arms
proliferation expert at the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in
Washington.
Nuclear proliferation experts say there was a discrepancy between South
Africa's uranium enrichment records and independent calculations of the
likely output of the plant.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Companies to be required to revalue assets regularly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES will be required to revalue regularly most of the assets shown in
their accounts, under radical proposals issued yesterday by the body which
sets accounting standards in the UK.
They will need to show properties, quoted investments and commodities in
their balance sheets at current values which are updated every few years,
according to two documents from the Accounting Standards Board.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board, said: 'The balance sheet does not
make sense. This will reduce the scope for manipulation by companies and
remove a lot of discretion.'
He said he would like to see full revaluations of assets every five years,
and 'desktop' or partial revaluations every year.
The action will halt the practice by which companies can leave assets
undervalued on their balance sheets by showing them at their original
purchase price or historical cost. It will also hit companies with
properties which they have revalued but which are now overvalued because of
the slump in property prices.
It is likely to generate opposition from companies during consultation in
the coming months that revaluations will be costly and subjective.
But a survey commissioned by the board last year showed that 70 per cent of
companies already revalue operating properties and 83 per cent had done so
within the past five years. The board's discussion document says the three
options for valuation are to return to historical cost accounting, introduce
full current values or address existing anomalies.
The board favours the latter option, saying historical cost accounting would
be regressive and full current values would be extremely costly and unlikely
to gain support from companies.
But in a separate draft chapter of the board's statement of principles - on
which its standards are based - it calls ultimately for a move to regular
revaluations of all assets and liabilities at the current value to the
business.
The statement also calls for the introduction of the concept of 'capital
maintenance' which would reflect the true value of a company's capital over
time.
But Mr Tweedie said: 'This is the agenda for the unforeseeable future. At
the moment we are just moving modestly to clean up the present system.'

FT  25 MAR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Tide turns in the world economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turning points have so often been diagnosed in the world economy that any
suggestion of a new one must be made very tentatively. Yet a glance at the
charts in this article suggests that one may have arrived; and the thought
is re-enforced by two disquieting themes which have emerged from the UK
Budget.
One is the pessimistic Treasury projection of a widening gap between actual
output and productive potential, despite the so-called recovery. This has
abysmal implications for unemployment, despite last month's freak good
figures.
The second theme is that a yawning Budget deficit is still in prospect even
after the chancellor's tax increases. The two themes together lead to a
dilemma which is brought out most starkly by the more pessimistic projection
provided by the Treasury as an alternative to its central assumption. This
shows that, with a growth rate only  1/2 per cent a year below the central
path, the public sector borrowing requirement would remain in 1997-98 - one
year or more after the next election - nearly twice the Maastricht limit.
This is probably too pessimistic. But if the British government were faced
with this prospect, should there be fierce curbs on public spending and more
tax increases - which might make low growth even worse? Or should the
deficit be allowed to run or even increase, despite galloping debt interest,
which by the late 1990s is expected to exceed Pounds 30bn and account for
almost all the projected deficit?
There has been a near-silence on this dilemma since I posed it last week.
For no one has yet satisfactorily resolved whether Budgets are primarily
exercises in government housekeeping or whether they have a wider role in
balancing the economy, which might make it legitimate deliberately to budget
for a deficit. A longer and international perspective might help.
The background to the revival of sound money orthodoxies in the 1980s was
the experience of the later 1960s and the 1970s. By then the attempts of
governments to spend their way into full employment objectives led to
increasingly rapid inflation, without any discernible benefits for
unemployment which soared from one business cycle to the next. The end of
the Bretton Woods system, and the first oil-price explosion following the
Yom Kippur war of 1973, signalled the end of the postwar golden age.
Subsequently, stagflation - high unemployment combined with high inflation -
dominated the scene.
The ground was thus prepared for the counter-revolution which declared that
Budgets should be balanced, or nearly so, at least over an economic cycle,
and that monetary policy should be given the task of trying to avoid both
inflationary and deflationary shocks. Growth and jobs were then left to
supply-side policies - often a euphemism for lower and more flexible wages
and weaker unions.
A fresh bout of rethinking may now, however, be required. For we are no
longer in a world where each successive cycle takes inflation to new
heights. The inflationary peak of 1990 was well below the peaks of 1974 and
1980. On the contrary, inflation now seems to be declining steeply from one
cycle to the next.
The application of the monetary brakes required to deal with the much more
moderate inflationary upsurge of the late 1980s has nevertheless led to a
severe increase in unemployment. It will not be surprising if it goes higher
than in the previous cycle, especially in Europe.
It is thus at least worth considering whether we may be approaching a period
of secular demand deficiency - by which I mean a period when output and
employment are held down by an inadequate level of private and public
spending. The Keynesians who cried 'wolf' so often in the postwar decades
may eventually come into their own.
It is vital not to exaggerate. The increase in total spending in the Group
of Seven countries, measured by nominal GDP (which is also equivalent to
inflation plus real growth) has never fallen below 4 1/2 per cent per annum
in the recession of the 1990s - admittedly further than it did in the 1980s,
when it never went below 6 per cent. But this is still a complete contrast
to the 1930s when prices fell by double digit amounts in the US and Germany;
and even in the UK prices dropped by an average of nearly 5 per cent for
three years running.
Indeed, it is ludicrous for enemies of the franc fort policy, under which
French inflation has fallen to 2 per cent, to compare its tribulations with
the prewar period when France remained too long in the gold bloc. In that
period French prices fell for five years in a row.
Nevertheless it is just possible that the macroeconomic environment may
become an obstacle to employment in its own right.
In any case, it is quite likely that ingrained habits and institutions are
such that attempts to reduce inflation literally to zero run into a strong
resistance barrier and thus have an effect on output and employment similar
to that arising from outright deflation between the wars. With consumer
price inflation in the G7 countries now averaging just less than 3 per cent
a year the world is not far from reasonable price stability.
If inflation remains low or negligible over the next few cycles, but
unemployment continues to creep up and output to stay well below potential,
it will not be good enough just to parrot the slogans of the 1980s. How then
should we respond to a problem of medium-term demand deficiency if it
occurs?
I have just finished reading the second volume of Robert Skidelsky's Keynes
biography, The Economist as Saviour, covering the 1920s and 1930s. I am
still unable to compete in saying what Keynes really meant or should have
meant. But some features hit one in the face.
Keynes's most frequent theme was the need for low interest rates to prevent
demand deficiency from occurring. He was acutely aware that interest rates
were a highly psychological phenomenon and he was always sensitive to
anything which would give an unnecessary upward push to market ideas of the
normal rates. For instance, he argued in 1937 that the main part of the cost
of prewar rearmament should be met out of taxation. For he was very anxious
not to use interest rates as a brake on demand. 'If we allow the rate of
interest to be affected,' he remarked, 'we cannot easily reverse the trend.'
In the 1990s, it is clear that long-term real interest rates are set in the
international capital markets. There are, moreover, limits to how far even
nominal short-term interest rates can be reduced unilaterally. Even outside
the European exchange rate mechanism, attempts by medium-sized European
countries to reduce interest rates too far on their own can all too easily
lead to continuing depreciation and high rates of inflation, without any
offsetting benefit to jobs. This is in contrast to the 1930s when the
presence of outright deflation drew the sting from currency depreciation.
Today, it is only in the context of a stabilisation programme for a large
group of countries, such as the G7, that the low interest rate route is
feasible. The main obstacle to its achievement is the Bundesbank's desire to
reduce interest rates slowly because of post-unification stresses, despite
the gathering German recession.
But to come back to Keynes: his flirtation with public works began in the
1920s, when the commitment to stay on gold at the 1914 parity precluded a
cheap money policy. In the 1930s he had a more fundamental worry. This was
that it might not be feasible to get interest rates down far enough to
secure maximum non-inflationary levels of employment. Thus public investment
acquired a new role as a supplementary method of demand management,
irrespective of the external and monetary regime.
Nevertheless the role of investment in stimulating demand does not follow
from Keynesian theory, whatever Keynes himself might have thought. Formally,
Keynes emphasised investment because it was the component of demand that
fluctuated most. But when there is a deficiency of total spending, whatever
its origin, increased spending of any kind, including consumer spending, is
just as good at plugging the hole.
How about using Budget deficits to stimulate private spending? Keynes never
made quite clear, or fully worked out, what he really thought of Budget
deficits. Sometimes he claimed that public investment would so stimulate
activity that the Budget would be rebalanced within a few years. At other
times he emphasised the need for a separate capital Budget.
In our own time the first instrument for maintaining adequate nominal demand
growth must be monetary and interest rate policy. But if recovery turns out
to be weak or very prolonged, we may have to settle for a series of quite
high Budget deficits as shock absorbers.
Even though an internally held national debt is mainly a transfer burden
between citizens, it is a burden nonetheless. It is better to avoid levying
ever-heavier taxes on one group of citizens in order to make ever-high
interest payments to another and overlapping group. The sooner the burden
can be transfered to monetary policy, the better. In the meanwhile, the UK
government should adopt a less cavalier attitude to the debt interest rate
burden and try to minimise it by devices such as more short-term borrowing,
and more borrowing on indexed terms.
If at all possible, the Budget should be brought back towards balance, or at
least towards the Maastricht guidelines in the course of the 1990s. The
weasely 'if possible' is there because the chance of a Keynesian liquidity
trap, which would prevent interest rates falling to a level consistent with
non-inflationary growth, has to be taken seriously, for the first time since
the second world war.
When the world was hit by a negative demand shock after the first oil price
explosion in the 1970s, it was very easy to have negative real interest
rates. Because of the inflationary background quite high nominal interest
rates could be combined with negative real ones. Although this had its
disadvantages, it was of some help in cushioning the recession of the 1970s.
Today, this route is closed. For the very success in reducing inflation now
makes it hard to get negative, or even very low, real interest rates.
But I cannot resist remarking in conclusion that a nominal GDP objective -
an old hobby horse of mine - would serve equally well if the need still is
to rein back against inflation, or if it turns out to be something more
expansionary.

Has dirty work entered the contest between British Gas, the monopoly
household supplier, and ambitious newcomer Alliance Gas? One of the biggest
contenders in the now competitive industrial market, Alliance claims that if
allowed to serve domestic customers, it could cut their bills by Pounds 50
yearly - which the reigning supplier disputes hotly.
Hitherto, the two sides have confined themselves to rival advertising
campaigns. But now British Gas has begun noisily and dustily digging up the
road outside Alliance's headquarters.
Nor were staff there any happier for the news that another of the diggers'
enemies, the Office of Gas Supply, was rocked by a loud gas explosion in its

Meanwhile, long-suffering watchers of the Gatt round may be heartened by the
latest reshuffle of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's agricultural team. Franz-Josef
Feiter, the chancellor's adviser on agriculture, has moved over to the
Agriculture Ministry to become the new state secretary there.
His responsibility as the chancellor's leading adviser on the Gatt trade
negotiations now falls to his colleague Johannes Ludewig, head of the
economics department. Given Ludewig's greater interest in free trade, and
lesser interest in protecting agriculture, this could be bad news for
France's rearguard action to resist a compromise on farm trade in the Gatt.

At a time when the new US administration is upsetting its partners with
confusing signals on trade policy, it is only natural that Carla Hills, the
former US trade representative, should try to exploit the policy vacuum.
Hills, 59-year-old wife of former SEC chairman Roderick Hills, has followed
the route of many out-of-work politicians and become a Washington
consultant. Her former deputy Julius Katz, and a couple of her other
officials, Erin Endean and Robert Fisher, have joined her in the aptly named
Hills Company whose aim is to help businesses maximise their opportunities
and minimise their risks in the global economy.
Even though she is one of yesterday's executives, her reputation for
effectiveness means that there should be no shortage of clients wanting
their hands held as they watch the worrying conflicts emerging in the new
administration's trade policy.
Admittedly, Hills is first and foremost a lawyer, like her successor, Mickey
Kantor. She made her initial mark as a ruthless negotiator rather than a
policy-maker. But strength as a policy-maker emerged quickly thereafter.
Kantor, take note.

A mobile phone racket which has already confused the airwaves over Australia
and Sweden has hit London. High tech criminals who have pinched mobiles have
found a way of altering the in-built electronic security number so that the
bill goes to another user. Salesmen in long coats lined with phones are now
touting stolen state-of-the-art equipment around offices in London for
Pounds 260 apiece with the promise that they will be good for a year, no
charge.
Gives Freefone numbers a whole new meaning.

The irony of yesterday's humiliating statement from Barclays bank should be
obvious to all but the most short-sighted City fund manager. Here is a bank
which has trained the well-regarded chief executives of Midland, Standard
Chartered and the TSB, announcing that it can't find a chief executive from
within its own ranks.
The idea that Barclays' management below board level is any worse than the
other high street banks is hard to justify. True, the bank made a fool of
itself in the property market and has mucked up its management succession.
But was it really necessary for the five knights of the Barclays boardroom
to send out such a demoralising signal to the other ranks? Even during
NatWest's darkest hour, there was never any suggestion that it should hire a
chief executive from outside.
No doubt the decision to look externally will be applauded by the corporate
governance bores. There is no shortage of out-of-work US bankers who would
jump at the chance of running Barclays. Australia's troubled Westpac, for
example, has just imported Robert Joss from Wells Fargo. Bank of Scotland's
Bruce Patullo, who has made fewer mistakes than most bankers, could be a
contender. But his weakness is that he insists on combining the job of
governor and chief executive.
Whoever it is, the next chief executive of Barclays will almost certainly
have to be a real banker since there are not many left on the board. The
decision to bring in an outsider is risky. A more sensible alternative would
have been to promote a respected non-executive director, like Sir Martin
Jacomb, to be chairman and leave the current chief executive to sort out the
mess.

THE GOVERNMENT'S go-ahead for a Pounds 2.5bn rail link between London and
the Channel tunnel is a welcome commitment to a long-delayed and badly
needed project. Commitments, however, do not build railway lines - that
takes money and shovels, and so far neither are much in evidence.
Against this background, it is perhaps worth asking exactly what the
rail-link commitment amounts to. First, the government has committed itself
to a route. Second, it has committed itself to introducing legislation that
will permit the line's construction. And third, it has committed itself to
seeing the project go forward as a joint venture between public and private
sectors, with the government 'prepared in principle to provide substantial
public-sector support'.
What is missing from this list, of course, is any promise that the rail link
will actually be built. The government cannot make such a promise because it
still does not know who is going to build the line or how it is to be
funded.
The hope must be that the chancellor's recently stated enthusiasm for
encouraging private-sector participation in the funding of infrastructure
projects is about to bear fruit. After amiable discussions between the
private sector and the Treasury, the two will supposedly agree a funding
package that allows the private sector to make a good profit while
simultaneously ensuring value for money for the taxpayer.
Yet this kind of optimism suggests a triumph of hope over experience. The
objectives of public and private sector in any joint venture are clearly in
potential conflict, because the point at which the private sector begins to
make money is the point at which the Treasury begins to feel cheated. Hence,
at the government's last attempt to get the Channel tunnel rail link built
through joint funding, the government contribution demanded by the private
sector proved to be so large that the government tore up the proposal in
horror. And even where public and private sectors do find it possible to
agree on the principles of a funding package, there can be severe
difficulties in translating the agreement into cash. Witness, for example,
the long delays in getting the private sector to deliver its promised
contribution to the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee Line extension.
Perhaps it will all be different this time. Certainly, the government's
commitment to joint funding sounds stronger than ever. Certainly, the
government's plans for developing the east Thames corridor add a new
imperative. But with each new go-ahead for transport projects that never
materialise, the British public grows wearier and more cynical about the
prospects that any of them will happen. The government stands to be judged
on whether this latest private funding initiative has real substance, or
whether it is just the latest in a long line of excuses for procrastinating
over vital improvements to the nation's inadequate transport infrastructure.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Leading Article: The Bank's role
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BACK TO basics has been the slogan of countless companies after the
conglomerate excesses of the past three decades. The idea appears now to
have penetrated the rarefied world of central banking. Yesterday Mr Brian
Quinn, an executive director of the Bank of England, warned that there was a
growing mismatch between the ever-wider range of services provided by
commercial banks, and the allocation of responsibilities among watchdogs.
Consumer protection in the wider financial services area was not, he argued,
the right role for a central bank; and he added, in a characteristic piece
of central bankerly understatement, that there was 'a question whether the
current arrangements may not, at some point, have to be considered'.
A clear re-statement of the Bank's role in prudential supervision is
undoubtedly welcome, after the debacle of Bank of Credit and Commerce
International. But whether the narrowness with which the Bank defines its
remit can be reconciled with market reality is a moot point. Mr Quinn
chooses to make a distinction between supervision, which is one of the means
by which central bankers head off risks to the banking system as a whole,
and regulation, which he sees as being about rules covering activities,
products and services available to investors and policyholders. Yet in
practice, the distinction is often blurred.
After the implementation of monetary policy, the chief role of the Bank is
the protection of depositors in the interests of the stability of the
system. Mr Quinn puts a traditional case for the activity of prudential
supervision being tied to the central bank acting as a lender of last resort
to individual institutions. And, without being specific to the point of
raising questions of moral hazard, he sets out unexceptionable criteria for
such last resort lending operations.
The difficulty arises over the erosion of boundaries between different
financial products. Savings products such Tessas are both a deposit and an
investment. Even where banking products are not closely related to deposits,
any loss of confidence in them could still lead to cross-infection, as Mr
Quinn himself acknowledges.
The fact is that convergence in financial services is very different from
conglomeration in industry. It is rooted in market logic and, in some cases,
genuine product synergy. As commercial banks have lost their corporate
clients to the investment bankers, a purist definition of the
lender-of-last-resort function which confines itself to commercial banking
also becomes unrealistic, as the stock market crash of 1987 demonstrated. In
order to restrain the moral hazard implicit in deposit insurance and
last-resort lending, there is a powerful case for creating a separate
category of heavily insured low-risk, low-return deposit taking
institutions. But even then, uninsured institutions could still pose
systemic threats. One suspects that the Bank of England, regardless of its
formal responsibilities, would still end up taking the flak.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Unrest on the Belgian front
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATIVE flurries surrounding the Belgian franc rarely give rise to more
than a flutter on foreign exchange seismographs. Underlining Belgium's
apparent credentials as a member of the 'hard core' of the European Monetary
System, since 1990 the Belgian National Bank has kept the franc within a
narrow 0.25 percentage point fluctuation margin against the D-Mark.
Now, however, the illusion that the Belgian franc is simply a north-western
appendage of the German currency has been shattered. Pressure on the franc
forced the Belgian central bank to raise interest rates yesterday for the
second time in six weeks. The outbreak of Belgian monetary hostilities does
not represent an isolated incident. Belgium's travails illustrate problems
at the heart of the Maastricht programme for European convergence.
The proximate cause of the difficulties is a budgetary squabble. Belgium's
public-sector debt exceeds 130 per cent of gross domestic product. This is
more than double the Maastricht target of 60 per cent - one of the
conditions set to determine EC members' suitability for economic and
monetary union (Emu). Interest payments were nearly twice last year's
public-sector deficit of 6.8 per cent of GDP, itself well in excess of the 3
per cent Maastricht target.
Pleading the need to stick to the Emu path, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian
prime minister, has proposed 1993 tax rises and spending cuts equivalent to
1.6 per cent of GDP. After his coalition failed to agree, Mr Dehaene offered
his government's resignation, though this may be essentially a ploy to
concentrate coalition party minds.
Another reason for nervousness lies in uncertainty caused by parliamentary
agreement last month to transform Belgium into a federal state. Fears that
Belgium could disintegrate into two entities - Flemish-speaking Flanders and
francophone Wallonia - may be overdone. Yet the accord has prompted some
anxiety about the risks of an eventual north-south split over debt
repayments. At the very least, regional factionalism could hamper the drive
for budgetary solutions.
Belgium is trapped between two unattractive policy options. Monetary
tightening - in particular higher long-term interest rates - will in the
short run set back efforts to approach the Maastricht targets. The economy
seems likely to contract in 1993, putting upward pressure on public
deficits. In view of close trade ties with Germany, a dash for growth
through devaluation would spur inflation.
Belgium has little choice but to keep taking the medicine. Yet if the
general chances of attaining Emu come to appear increasingly remote, the
painful policies Belgium is following will command ever diminishing public
support.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Dark descent to a political minefield: As the UK government
finalises its plan for coal, Michael Cassell examines the explosive events
of the past six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Major must have been grateful for the brief respite offered by the
journey home from Birmingham to Great Stukeley. Behind him was a difficult,
one-day European summit and the toughest week of his premiership; worse was
to come.
Four days after last October's EC gathering, called in the wake of Britain's
forced exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, British Coal had sent
shock waves through the coalfields. Out of 50 pits, 31 had to be shut, some
in days and all in six months. More than 30,000 miners faced compulsory
redundancy; another 120,000 jobs in supplier industries could go.
Neil Clarke, recruited as chairman of British Coal to mastermind the
'ultimate privatisation', expressed regret. Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, tried to soothe the pain with a Pounds 1bn aid package
extracted from the an unwilling Treasury. Major was sorry for the miner's
'anguish', but the commercial argument was compelling and irrevocable.
Within 48 hours, ministers would be facing defeat at the hands of their
backbenchers. Two years earlier, the government's privatisation of an
electricity supply industry, which takes 80 per cent of British Coal's
output, had sown the seeds of the dilemma. March 1993 was supposed to see an
end to subsidised coal contracts and the demise of a rigged market, as the
generators, PowerGen and National Power, would then be free to buy where
they wished and to strike new British Coal contracts.
Last autumn, complex legislation to privatise British Coal was already being
prepared, with a sale due this summer. It was widely accepted that the 65m
tonnes of coal bought by the generators in the year ending next week would
fall to about 40m tonnes in 1994, and later to 30m. Prices and contract
periods, however, remained unresolved. A jobs shake-out was inevitable.
Heseltine wanted to lock all the parties in a room and 'bang heads' until
agreement was reached. But in the words of one DTI minister: 'We couldn't do
an old-style, ministerial fix. We explored all the avenues. But it was like
going down a one-way street and continually turning off into blind
alleyways.'
As contract negotiations stretched into late summer, the DTI and Treasury
stepped up equally slow-moving talks with British Coal aimed at replacing
miners' redundancy terms. The company convinced Heseltine a fair package
would limit the damage. It told ministers: 'If you sugar the pill, we will
deliver the goods.' But the pill remained unpalatable. In mid-September, Mr
Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, leaked a
ministerial letter listing 30 doomed pits. Heseltine admitted further
closures were coming but battled for pay-offs matching the old terms.
A Coal Board insider recalls: 'The Treasury was utterly predictable. It was
reluctant to match the old redundancy terms. We became embroiled in an
intellectual argument over why miners should get preferential redundancy
terms to any private-sector employees.'
A colleague of Heseltine adds: 'If the Treasury had not been so
bloody-minded, we could have bitten the bullet earlier and 10 pits could
have gone in the summer.'
The prime minister intervened. Heseltine got an average Pounds 28,000 a man,
less than British Coal wanted. On October 2, he and Tim Eggar, his energy
minister, reported to a prime minister preoccupied with preparations for the
following week's party conference. A closure announcement had to go ahead.
'A' day, as it was entered in the diaries of British Coal executives, was
Tuesday October 13. Until the day before, the company would not tell
Heseltine which pits were to close.
'We refused to tell him. We knew from bitter experience that the government
machine leaked like a sieve and we did not want to pile on the agony at the
collieries,' a British Coal manager recalls.
On October 12, Heseltine and Clarke met to make final preparations for the
announcement. The next day, Clarke called in the press while Heseltine made
his own announcement: 'It was a stupid mistake,' says a close friend.
'It took the heat off Clarke and left Michael looking like the bad guy,
instead of the white knight riding to the rescue with Pounds 1bn. But he
wanted to face it head on.'
The details provoked an immediate storm. According to a British Coal
executive: 'People in the industry were prepared for the worst. It was the
wider backlash which caught everyone out.'
Backbench Tory MPs were as angry as the general public at the scale and
immediacy of the plan. MPs were hit by an avalanche of protest letters.
'They were proper letters, type-written, correctly spelt and predominantly
from natural Tories,' says one MP.
For a day or two, ministers thought they could ride it out. At a party in 12
Downing Street to celebrate the 40th birthday of Gus O'Donnell, the prime
minister's press secretary, one minister said the storm would quickly abate.
A minister involved in seeking a solution to British Coal's dilemma recalls:
'We were already in a sea of troubles and failed to foresee the chemical
reaction which the closures would set off.'
Any hope the row would be short-lived was quickly dispelled by Sir Marcus
Fox, chairman of the influential 1922 backbench committee of Tory MPs. Sir
Marcus pronounced the terms 'unacceptable' and his colleagues 'incensed'.
Scargill suddenly found Mr Winston Churchill, the Tory MP for Davyhulme and
Sir Winston's grandson, among his champions.
Downing Street was forced repeatedly to amend its version of events. Gillian
Shephard, the employment secretary, though informed of the plans, was not
told about the Heseltine press conference. She was furious. An employment
department insider reflects: 'There was little love lost between them
before. There is even less now.'
On October 18, the eve of parliament's return, the nation turned off 2m
lightbulbs in protest and men from Frickley colliery dumped coal outside
Heseltine's Oxfordshire home.
After a weekend ring-round of Tory MPs by the party whips, Richard Ryder,
chief whip, warned that the government faced defeat at the hands of its own
party. Major summoned six ministers to a meeting. Heseltine spelled out the
'unanswerable case' for closures.
Two and a half hours later, he had reluctantly accepted the need for a
change in tactics. The blow had to be softened. He went straight into
session with officials.
The next morning, Monday October 19, Downing Street admitted ministers had
been 'so close to the detail' of the closure decision they had failed to
assess its impact. Major summoned an emergency cabinet meeting to hint at a
change in tactics. A cabinet colleague remarked: 'We had all taken our eye
off the ball. It was a cock-up.'
Afterwards, at a Carlton Club lunch with the executive of the 1922
committee, the prime minister indicated that although 10 pits would have to
go, the remaining 21 would be looked at again. The peace offering was not
sufficient. One committee member said afterwards: 'I am still loyal to John
Major. I hope he survives, but he won't if he continues in this way.'
An hour later in the Commons, Heseltine said there would be a temporary
reprieve for some pits but no further, detailed review. Any changes would be
'at the margin'.
Next morning, he faced his own, angry backbenchers in committee room 14 of
the Commons. A show of hands went against him, forcing from him assurances
that he would take a broader look at the fuel market for generating
electricity. An MP present reflected: 'We put him through the mangle.'
Hours later, Lord Wakeham, former energy secretary and chairman of the ad
hoc cabinet committee on coal, told the Lords there would be a wide-ranging
review to ensure the coal market had been correctly assessed. Major
confirmed the new approach in the Commons and welcomed a trade and industry
committee decision to hold its own inquiry into energy strategy.
On October 21, Trafalgar Day, as 40,000 miners marched through London,
Heseltine paced the Commons, homing in on waverers who could help defeat the
government in that day's Labour-organised debate. Nobody was spared. One
sceptic remarked: 'What can you say when you have a shopping list of 12
items and you're offered 14?'
A bravura Commons performance from Heseltine won the day and a majority of
15. A few days later, he announced there would be a white paper on UK energy
policy, a tactic which provided a vital breathing space. But as advice and
opinions poured in, another blow landed.
Four days before Christmas, Lord Justice Glidewell declared the closure
decision unlawful and demanded a review procedure involving an element of
independent scrutiny. A humiliated Heseltine admitted the government had
'got it wrong'.
By January 19, he was running into fierce, internal opposition to his
compromise proposals, entailing a subsidy of about Pounds 10 a tonne,
clearly identified to consumers as the cost to be paid for public concern. A
supporter summed up the plan: 'It was about paying for your conscience.'
At a cabinet committee meeting, Heseltine found himself confronting an
alliance of ministers - including Michael Howard, the environment secretary,
Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and
Gillian Shephard - threatening to block the plan unless subsidies were
short-term and rapidly reduced.
Howard, with the support of Clarke, had tabled an alternative strategy. He
argued that, if some pits were to be kept open, the decision should be
openly based on social, rather than economic, reasons. The government would
tell the Commons that, on social grounds, it would pay time-limited
subsidies to individual pits.
But the idea soon hit trouble, with ministers unable to devise criteria
under which individual collieries could be kept open. The plan was rejected.
Friends of Shephard and Howard continued to brief the press against
Heseltine for his handling of the affair. As the prime minister left for
India on a trade mission, irritated Downing Street sources complained: 'It
doesn't do anyone any good to brief against their colleagues.'
By the end of January, Heseltine won further support in reports from
independent consultants which backed the government's grim prognosis for
coal. Wakeham's cabinet committee was by now concluding that additional coal
purchases by the generators would have to be subsidised.
The Commons trade and industry select committee, however, contrived a
classic political compromise, suggesting more than half the threatened pits
could be saved if the market for coal was increased over five years at a
cost of about Pounds 500m.
Its report left Heseltine and his colleagues to calculate how far they had
to go to stave off the threat of defeat. One minister claims: 'Sensible
analysis immediately became a pathetic, political numbers game.'
As Heseltine struggled to find a formula, he became embroiled in a row over
the generators over how much coal they would take. John Baker, National
Power chief executive, told him they were being invited to 'dig our own
grave . . . to solve your coal problem'.
Some ministers revelled in the discomfort of a man toppled from his party
pedestal: 'Junior Thatcherite ministers think it has all been wonderful,'
says a Heseltine ally. Stories suggesting he is fed up, disenchanted and
even seriously ill have flowered in Westminster.
'All rubbish,' says a friend. 'Michael admits the coal business has been the
most frustrating and intractable problem he has ever faced. He is frustrated
that the affair has swallowed so much of his time. But that is it.'
With his 'final offer' now about to be disclosed, Heseltine may look back
for a moment or two on the affair. He does not seek to lay most of the blame
on British Coal and Neil Clarke, though he is not overly impressed with the
company's behaviour. In any case, the fate of the industry and those who
serve it should soon be a matter for new owners. He may be forgiven for
praying 'not a moment too soon'.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Letter: Filled with delight at the demise of the Taurus
system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From W H POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Am I the only one to be filled with delight at the demise of the
computerised Taurus share registration system?
For a merchant banker whose idea of a long-term investment is about two
weeks, the present system might seem a bit slow, but I cherish my share
certificates. They assure me that I really do hold my shares. How would I
ever persuade a computer that it had got my holding wrong? And would it ever
tell me it had made a mistake?
The great British public has good reason to be delighted too. I'm sure it
didn't look forward to two-thirds of a penny on income tax, or yet more VAT,
to replace the chancellor's lost stamp duty on share transactions.
The present stamp duty falls on those who are affluent enough to own shares,
but who knows where the tax to replace it would fall?
British industry ought to be pleased as well. It stabilises the value of
companies by forcing investors to take a long enough view of their holding
to recoup the stamp duty. Unit trust managers likewise stabilise their funds
by the similar device of unequal bid and offer prices. In both cases the
added stability makes for a more considered and longer-term approach to
management.
I am far from convinced that an 'efficient' stock market works to the good
of industry. During Germany and Japan's spectacular post-war growth, traded
volumes in their stock markets were too low for them to qualify.
From the point of view of industry, the stock market's significance lies in
its willingness to absorb new share flotations and rights issues that can
provide new capital. Trading, on the other hand, only provides an indication
of the terms on which it might be raised. As far as I can see, Taurus would
have helped trading but done nothing to help provide new industrial
investment. Yet it is that investment that is needed.
You may be surprised to hear that this contrary view comes to you from a
chartered electronics engineer who works with computers daily.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Letter: Japan cautious about economic logic of G7 aid for
Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MASAKI OMURA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I think the recent criticism of the Japanese government's inaction
regarding the G7 assistance for Russia is misguided. Contrary to these
critical assertions, neither the principle of the northern territorial issue
nor a lack of understanding of the impact of a Russian collapse constitute
the main reason for Japan's careful attitude. The key issue is the
workability and desirability of a hasty reaction by the G7.
In the past there has been a common understanding among the G7 countries
that western financial assistance will only work with the appropriate
domestic economic policy and the development of the institutions necessary
for a market economy. Only a small portion of the Dollars 24bn committed by
the G7 has been used, mainly because these preconditions have not emerged in
Russia. I do not see any reason why financial assistance should suddenly
begin to work now without these preconditions.
It may be argued that an urgent decision is necessitated by the political
considerations. However, it would be quite nave to expect a politically
motivated action without an economic result to be of substantial help to
President Yeltsin in the current crisis. Given that the battle between the
president and the parliament is purely a power struggle, a G7 commitment
will not weaken the attack by the parliament. Nor will it strengthen public
support for the president until it leads to an improvement in the economic
situation.
It will certainly be necessary to re-examine the economic reform strategy in
Russia. In fact, from the beginning, Japan has been the least enthusiastic
country in advocating that market forces alone, without due consideration of
the social reality, can achieve a successful transformation. However, a
rethinking of this issue should focus on the long-term rather than on
short-term political considerations.
Nobody can deny the seriousness of the current Russian situation. But one
has to recognise what we can do and what we cannot. Your editorial, 'The
choice over Russia' (March 17), argued that we should go ahead, despite the
fact that there is no guarantee of workability. However, a G7 commitment
which disregards economic logic will at best be unlikely to work, and at
worst create unrealistic expectations and so be unproductive. This would be
nothing but a panic reaction, and as such the G7 countries, in their
self-appointed role as world leaders, have a basic responsibility to avoid
it.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Letter: Duty could pay for equity settlement system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY ARCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You suggest ('After Taurus, City lessons', March 23) that an equity
market settlement system may not be a public good worthy of state attention,
while previously saying the state is the only institution capable of
overcoming the 'free rider' problem.
According to the chancellor, the state will be raising about Pounds lbn
during the 1993-94 financial year from stamp duty payable on the purchase of
securities. This tax is paid by those who use the settlement system. The
same groups would benefit from further investment in that system. Where is
the conflict with the doctrine of 'public good' if this class of stamp duty
were to be retained for just one more year, and the money raised thereby
spent by the state on a new equity market settlement system?
Despite the Treasury's traditional reluctance to link fund-raising and
spending, there can seldom have been such a clear-cut case for making an
exception - particularly in the light of the recent fiasco and its potential
implications for London as a financial centre.

Sir, In your story, 'OFT life insurance proposals,' (March 19) it is stated
that the Office of Fair Trading said life companies should be obliged to
allow low-cost sales outlets, such as building societies, to price their
products more cheaply than other higher cost agents.
Perhaps the OFT should have looked at what has happened to house and
contents insurance, which is nearly always far more expensive if taken out
through building societies than if arranged through a local insurance
broker. Presumably the OFT considers the latter to be a higher cost agent.

<TEXT>
WITTGENSTEIN Derek Jarman
FOREVER YOUNG (PG) Steve Miner
THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN (15) Jonathan Lynn
WIND (PG) Carroll Ballard
INDOCHINE (12) Regis Wargnier
In this week's newest Hollywood blockbuster, the young philosopher Ludwig
Wittgenstein (Mel Gibson) is deep-frozen by Cambridge scientists for 50
years and wakes up on the morning of the 1989 Americas Cup final in Newport,
Rhode Island. Reunited with his Indochinese girlfriend Catherine Deneuve, he
sets out to win the famous cup, but is sidetracked by an ambition to become
America's first independent black Congressman . . .
'Wake up, sir. You are having a nightmare]' It is my butler, holding the
morning cup of tea. It was all a dream; but for film critics these dreams
are becoming ever more indistinguishable from waking. Just how much damage
do regular doses of twice-daily filmgoing do to the brain and imagination?
First: I greatly enjoyed every film this week. Second: that is exactly the
problem. The pleasure derived from Derek Jarman's Wittgenstein seems to me
indistinguishable from that derived from Mel Gibson busking for tears and
laughter in the cryogenics epic Forever Young; and the week's other films we
will implicate in due course.
Feelgood movies are feelgood movies wherever they come from. And feelgood
metaphysics likewise; whether signed by a Viennese-Cambridge philosopher and
enacted with bargain-basement props against a black wall (Jarman) or blown
up to umpteen-millimetre while every violinist in Hollywood underscores the
magical, time-slicing plot that kicks off in 1939. Girl meets boy, girl has
coma, boy gets frozen, hello 1989, out with the handkerchiefs.
With art cinema on the retreat, and Western culture's populist current
pulling even higher criticism with it, no one today wants to work hard in
front of a movie screen. 'Serious' cinema, from today's Wittgenstein to last
week's Orlando, has become as all-singing, all-dancing as popular cinema. If
Bergman or Godard were beginning their careers in the 1990s rather than the
1950s, they would be making films like Swedish Angst Is Fun and Two Or Three
Things I Know About Macaulay Culkin.
Wittgenstein is, make no mistake, enormous fun. Co-scripted by Jarman with
Professor Terry Eagleton, the movie turns the life of the Austrian-born,
Cambridge-naturalised philosopher into a lantern slide lecture with
intervals for wacky comedy. Around Karl Johnson's sweetly stammering hero
assemble, inter alia, Michael Gough as Bertrand Russell, Tilda Swinton
whooping it up in silks and feathers as Lady Ottoline Morrell and John
Quentin snapping out the Bloomsbury one-liners as J. Maynard Keynes.
Have we omitted the green Martian who challenges Wittgenstein's theories in
conversation? Or the rhinoceros under Bertrand Russell's table? Or the
neo-classical garb sported by Ludwig's upper-Viennese family, whom Jarman
envisions as poised forever on the starting blocks of some cosmic opera
seria.
'Class' is a major theme, as it would be in any Eagleton script. We scream
inwardly at some of the radical-propagandist hyperboles. Because Ottoline
was a Lady, need she be stricken with quite such an impenetrable drawl or
air of Marie Antoinettish disdain? 'I must send him some cocoa tablets, he
sounds rather depressed' she flutes of Wittgenstein, now stuck in an Italian
P-o-W camp writing his Tractatus.
But later, when our hero dons a boiler suit and departs for volunteer manual
labour in Russia, Jarman and Eagleton have the decency to chuckle at that
too. Then Ludwig comes back in time for a bit of love (gay) and a bit of
dying while history draws the curtain on a noble soul and his contribution
to philosophy.
Oh] his philosophy - we almost forgot that. I understand from the film that
it was something about the limits of language being the limits of one's
world. But I had to go to my bookshelves to mug it up again properly.
Wittgenstein is too busy being gay, skittish, highly coloured, dreadfully
enjoyable and even (Oh Hollywood on the Cam]) shamelessly tear-jerking at
the close to worry too much about thoughts and ideas.
Forever Young, directed by Steve Miner from a Kleenex-intensive script by
Jeffrey Abrams, carries on where Jarman's film leaves off. 1939 test pilot
Mel Gibson, realising like Wittgenstein the limits of language or philosophy
in the face of the unassimilable (his girlfriend's coma after a street
accident), has himself frozen. Cryogenics boffin George Wendt sticks him in
the ice tray; then he wakes in 1989 to find the US military on his tail,
housewife Jamie Lee Curtis offering suburban haven and Curtis's young son
Elijah Wood, who accidentally defrosted him after stumbling into a military
warehouse, following terror with hero-worship.
Like Wittgenstein - indeed like all today's pleasure principle cinema -
Forever Young has an impatience with time and a honey-bee approach to mood.
It moves about the decades, buzzing from comedy to pathos to thrills to
tears. Finally it goes out in a blaze of manufactured pathos as love
conquers all on a Pacific promontory. (Surely it is the same promontory
where Julia Roberts loved and lost in the interchangeably-titled-and-plotted
Dying Young?)
Is Forever Young enjoyable? Yes, dreadfully. But in today's hedonistic
cinema, what movie is not? Even the flops seem so anxious for your
appreciation that you place a sparkle in your eyes in reel one and find it
still there at the end.
In The Distinguished Gentleman Eddie Murphy, Hollywood's grin on a stick,
moves through Washington DC holding aloft his brand of popsicle populism.
Murphy is a Florida con man who cons his way into Congress. He is soon
founding bogus foundations and panhandling for honorariums. But then a
little boy with cancer - yes] - wreaks a Capra-esque miracle and turns the
scam artist into a people's hero.
The script by former Walter Mondale speechwriter Marty Kaplan is knee-deep
in Washington lore but only ankle-deep in wit. And Britain's Jonathan Lynn
(Nuns On The Run) directs as if down on all fours trying to mop up every
drop. The villains are somewhat dull - Capra would have given us silken
Claude Rains and/or seismic Edward Arnold - and the maudlin subplot is an
embarrassment. But let us not over-carp. Murphy is there to unzip his smile
and flash his genius for mimicry, and I was still watching without
consulting my watch as the end credits rolled.
Wind is two hours of blithe drivel about championship yachting. It should
carry an environment-friendly notice: 'Beautiful scenery. Please do not
deposit movie dialogue.' The script by Mac Gudgeon and Rudy Wurlitzer
(vacationing from the talent that gave us Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid)
provoked unseemly giggles at the Press show. Americas Cup contender Matthew
Modine spends half the film tacking to avoid lines like 'Sometimes we pay
too high a price for our dreams' (yacht tycoon Cliff Robertson) or 'The most
important thing is finding your own wind' (himself), the other half trying
to make clear runs for the action channel.
The yachting scenes are well shot by director Carroll Ballard and
brilliantly 'sound-designed' by Alan Splet, with booms and crunches and
wind-howlings that shiver your timbers. But what price such panache on the
ocean when back on shore, life consists of waterlogged love-plots (Jennifer
Grey) and dialogue written on the back of a binnacle.
But as Wittgenstein once said, in one of his early untranslated works, even
bad art has its serenity. Regis Wargnier's much-hyped Indochine,
representing France at next week's Foreign Film Oscars, is the very
incarnation of the age of Brainless Hedonism. Time was when we looked to the
French for a cinema that was impudent (Godard), anarchic (Chabrol),
mercurial (Truffaut) or experimental (Resnais, Rivette); in a word,
challenging.
Today we get a 2 1/2 -hour slab of steamed-up melodrama with Catherine
Deneuve doing a Bette Davis in the tropics. Empires fall; lovers betray;
adopted daughters get pregnant; and when all else fails there is a battle
scene or some ooh-aah horror in an opium den. If only life were as daft and
colourful as the movies. But if only the movies were less daft and colourful
 -sometimes - and more intelligently related to real life.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Northern Ballet Theatre is in the midst of a regional tour with a triple
bill. That in itself is welcome news. For years our ballet companies have
had to cajole audiences with full-length offerings of often dubious merit
but of proven appeal because of their title. The 'Give them anything, but
call it Swan Lake' syndrome is, I trust, in decline. Triple bills at Covent
Garden have latterly played to excellent houses; this spring, English
National Ballet will again tour mixed programmes. Ballet is being shown as
something more than feathers and fairies, with Veronese lovers as the only
alternative.
NBT's new programme has its own audience-lure in A Simple Man, which brought
LS Lowry to the stage. Two new pieces complete the bill. I am not persuaded
that the Theatre Royal, Brighton, is the right place to see dancing: sight
lines are odd; the lighting on Tuesday night was cursory; the orchestra is
too visible; the stage cramps movement.
Both novelties are concerned with plotless dance; neither conveyed much
sense of formal design to sustain incident. Graham Lustig's D'Ensemble
demands far more space than Brighton could offer. Set to Dvorak's wind
serenade, it shows five couples being radiant or dewy-eyed or boisterous,
and, in these surroundings, too close to each other for comfort. It is
taxing for the men, somewhat predictable for the women, and it merits a
larger stage for its dances to be appreciated. Decoration is by Kaffe
Fassett - known for his knitting designs - and proposes bright costume
colours (which do not make the women's frocks any less dowdy) and a backdrop
that looks like a flowery and up-market subject for a jigsaw.
Extenzion is choreographed by Derek Williams, much admired as a dancer with
the Harlem Dance Theatre. It is said to be a 'jazz ballet', a genre more
notable than most for its cliches. The men in such exercises strut, throw
off multiple technical feats with energy if not finesse, and generally
indicate that St. Vitus is their patron saint. The women are called upon to
behave as if on day-release from the Reeperbahn. And so it proves in this
exhausting and foolish item. The chaps run and spin; the women flaunt it.
The stage is bathed in red light for part of the time.
There is a score by Philip Feeney that contains fascinating sonorities but
must clatter in the dance's galvanic footsteps. At the back of the stage is
a drop showing a version of Craigie Aitchison's Pink Vase, Still Life, which
has nothing to do with anything else that is happening, and to which I would
not like to give house-room. It is all hugger-mugger, and during Extenzion's
too generous span I thought enviously of Simeon Stylites.
NBT's casts were devoted over and above the call of duty to their tasks.
They plainly believe in what they are doing; I admire them and wish I could
share their convictions.
NBT's tour is sponsored by BT, which also supports the company's touring

FT  25 MAR 93 / Arts: Love's Labour's Lost - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ipswich's Wolsey Theatre enjoys a high reputation in East Anglia for its
Shakespeare productions. This year it has ventured a new angle on Love's
Labour's Lost by bringing in nine continental European actors to perform the
play's most obviously continental roles. The point is to reveal the
international nature of the play. But the stumbling-block is that, in four
cases, the actors' foreign accents are so strong as to render numerous lines
impenetrable.
When the Princess of France speaks 'beseemeth' with the stress on the first
syllable, when her companion Maria says of Berowne 'Not a word with him but
a chest' (not 'jest'), you know that Love's Labour's Lost, a play stuffed
with wordplay, is going to flounder.
Don Armado's verbosity seems odd, not funny, in a Spanish accent; even a
pompous line like 'Does thou infamonise me among potentates?' sounds merely
peculiar.
The pity is the more because the pacing and tone of Antony Tuckey's staging
is of a rare sensitivity. The war of wit and instinct is always alive, the
tension between intellectual rigour and sexual desire always exciting.
Shakespeare frequently celebrates wit, but seldom does he so plainly show
wit discomfited as here.
It is a mistake to put Love's Labour's into Edwardian attire. Shakespeare's
plays belong in the period he set them and/or the period he wrote them
and/or the period we live in. To set them in another period is to bypass
Shakespeare for the sake of irrelevant nostalgic prettiness.
The best contributions from the Continent come from Sebastian Baur
(German/Italian) as Longaville and Birgitte Ohsten (Danish) as Jacquenetta -
not just because their words are always lucid to us, but also because they
make Longaville's earnest/merry wit and Jacquenetta's flirtatious/used
situation unusually clear.
As the King of Navarre and Princess of France, the French actors Patrick
Forster-Delmas and Carole Franck will make a similarly keen impression if
ever their words grow clearer. I never doubted that they had an intelligent
understanding of what they were saying. Ferran Audi is a dolorous, unfunny,
posey Don Adriano who nonetheless brings out the character's impoverished
and lovelorn pathos.
Not surprisingly, the audience falls gratefully on the British contingent.
Best is Robert Benfield, who ideally realises the curate Nathaniel's sweet
love of learning. Steven Mann has just the right merry attack for Berowne,
the play's hero of wit. Richard Cant is a somewhat refined Costard - never
the 'clown' Shakespeare calls him - but his sunny, gentle humour brings out
the tenderness of tone behind the play's rapierwork.
At the Wolsey Theatre, Ipswich, until April 10

FT  25 MAR 93 / Arts: Doing the right thing - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The young trumpet player Terence Blanchard is the burnished sound behind
most of Spike Lee's celluloid. After serving with that finest of finishing
schools, Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, Blanchard plunged into composing with
scores for School Daze (1988), Do The Right Thing (1989) and most recently
Malcom X. During this period of concentrated writing activity, Blanchard,
who is just 31, began to have problems with his own playing and for a while
it looked as though he might spend the rest of his career with only his
charts for company.
On the evidence of his quintet's appearance at Ronnie's this week, however,
reports of his demise are greatly exaggerated. In a sombre but sometimes
startling collection of seamlessly segued movements called The Malcom X Jazz
Suite, Blanchard led his young quintet heroically.
The original film score was written for 40 pieces but this adapted and
improvised on version for quintet has a grainy texture on to which Blanchard
sears his notes to dramatic effect. The air of foreboding created by the
opening bass lines was transformed into an achingly cool and urban setting.
The addition of Troy Davis's simmering cymbals and Bruce Barth's plaintive
chords completing the setting for tight trumpet and tenor harmonies from
Blanchard and Sam Newsome. The pair have an impressive sound between them:
the sturdy tenor providing woody contrast to Blanchard's lustrous tone, both
able to produce feisty and elastic solos. A suite with such serious intent
as this might seem inappropriate for a club setting but the movements follow
conventional mores, and head arrangements with obligatory bludgeoning drum
parts separate the movements sufficiently well.
In contrast to the monochrome grandeur of Malcom X, the lush and complex
guitar work of Martin Taylor was a luxurious bonus. The 37-year-old English
concert guitarist is most often heard in the company of Stephane Grappelli,
or in a classical setting, but sounds equally comfortable spinning standards
from the stage of a smoky club. Indeed so relaxed and convincing is Taylor's
command of simultaneous rhythm, melody and bass that he could easily pass
for a trio. Chopping or sustaining, the vocalised tone and timing is a
joyous thing and his fitting in the spaces between two sets of Malcom X make
a beautifully balanced evening's entertainment.
At Ronnie Scott's until March 27

FT  25 MAR 93 / Arts: Handel's Messiah - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exactly 250 years ago last Tuesday - March 23 1743 - Handel's Messiah had
its British premiere, in the first Theatre Royal on the Covent Garden site.
Naturally enough, the Royal Opera laid on a commemorative performance.
Enterprisingly, it managed to be backward- and forward-looking at once, for
the chosen conductor was John Eliot Gardiner, with his Monteverdi Choir and
the English Baroque Soloists: a guarantee that this Messiah would represent
the most up-to-date findings from the back-to-the-1700s persuasion.
For most of Part I, the Gardiner ensemble sounded alert, precise, speedy -
and lightweight, to ears attuned to overweening Victorian forces. The
choruses 'And He shall purify' and 'For unto us a Child is born',
unaccustomedly fleet, added no ballast to the larger drama.
As expected, the dry Royal Opera acoustic flattered nobody: neither John
Aler's stylish, nor the flexible high bass of Rodney Gilfry (though the
counter-tenor James Bowman made his brief mark, and after an appealingly
rustic 'Pastoral Symphony' the boy-soprano Sam Pay too - true, plain and
'natural', ie blessedly innocent of King's College manners).
With Part II, however, the lithe strengths of Gardiner's style began to make
themselves felt. By then we had adjusted to the slimmed-down scale, and
could appreciate the lucid diction it permitted. Without any dense, mournful
instrumental cushion, the mezzo Catherine Robbin shaped a penetrating 'He
was despised and rejected'; Aler found a note of vehement regret in both of
his arias, and Gilfry spelled out 'Why do the nations so furiously rage
together?' as a lofty moral rebuke. The Hallelujah Chorus began trippingly,
with none of its 'traditional' heavy-duty thrust, but rose to a brighter,
sharper kind of climax.
Part III began with the soprano Sylvia McNair at her melting best in 'I know
that my Redeemer liveth'. (But decidedly sexy, too, in the candid modern
manner: could that possibly be right?) With a fine period-trumpet, Gilfry
swung robustly through 'The trumpet shall sound'. On Gardiner's reading, the
orthodox piety of the closing chorus was at once tender and provisional - no
Victorian, muscular-Christian dragooning there, only a hopeful uplift. The
whole performance was of a piece with that, humane and satisfying in its
particular low-calorie way.

Given the tremendous success of Tim Hunkin's series The Secret Life Of .. it
would be just like television to try with him, as previously with people
such as James Burke and Magnus Pike, to turn him into a more general purpose
presenter/entertainer. Let's hope it does not happen because his great
strength is his passionate interest in his subject, which is domestic or
popular machinery. The suspicion arises because today (8.30 C4) he
investigates the office. Technology is still involved, but it doesn't sound
the same as showing how a photocopier works. Also presenting the last of her
series The Goldring Audit is Mary Goldring whose subject is the electricity
industry. She finds that the monopoly position of the distribution companies
has led to a large rise in profits without any benefit to the consumer (9.00
C4). Having begun my life in a London under attack by doodlebugs I shall
watch the BBC2 series Labour Of Love with even more interest than usual.
This episode tells of the struggle to keep children safe and fed (9.30). In
Disguises Adam Holloway takes on the identity of a Bosnian refugee (9.30
ITV).

FT  25 MAR 93 / People: Sellars seizes his chance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Sellars, who made it as a partner with Europe's largest law firm
Clifford Chance six years ago at the age of 32, is quitting to join one of
his longstanding clients, Schroder Ventures.
Sellars, who acknowledges the move is highly unusual, says that 'being a
lawyer can be quite frustrating. You are constantly near the sharp end but a
lot of the really important decisions have actually been made by the time
you become involved'.
He will become the twelfth partner at the venture capital arm of merchant
bank Schroders, which specialises in medium-sized to large buy-outs.
Managing partner Jon Moulton says that despite the recession, his outfit has
seen one of its busiest 12 month periods ever. He said he expected Sellars
to become 'a general purpose partner - he's not coming here to keep the law
library'.
One of the few other cases of a law firm losing a partner in a similar move
is that of Victor Blank, a partner at Clifford Turner, as it then was,
moving to Charterhouse, where he is now chairman.
Linda Collier, Karen Cook, Lester Gray, John Kinsella, Paul Mullins, Vincent
Oratore (joining from Linklaters &amp; Paines), and Elizabeth Warren have been
appointed directors of J Henry Schroder Wagg &amp; Co. Gerry Aherne is appointed
a director of Schroder Investment Management, and Mark Smith a director of
Schroder Capital Management International.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Technology: Making bright ideas shine - A commercially
successful invention is one in a million. Andrew Fisher begins a series on
avoiding pitfalls / Innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVENTORS often fall in love with their ideas and find it hard to stop
talking about them. But ask them what their advice would be to anyone else
struck by an original idea and keen to make it commercial, and their reply
tends to be: forget it.
'It takes a lot of courage, faith, and obstinacy,' says James Dyson, a
successful designer-inventor whose products include the Ballbarrow - a
wheelbarrow with a pneumatic ball instead of a wheel - and a new vacuum
cleaner using high-speed cyclone technology.
'Having the idea is the easy bit,' comments John Endacott, an engineer who
has invented a new type of oil and water separator for offshore oil fields
which has been licensed by two companies. 'My advice to anyone coming up
with a new invention is: think about it, enjoy thinking about it, and then
throw the idea in the bin.'
That is where most ideas end up anyway, since the success rate for
inventions is tiny. Gazing round his spacious London office, one experienced
patent expert says resignedly: 'Ninety per cent of the files in this room
relate to nonsense - but I don't know which ones they are in advance.'
John Fisher, technical director of PA Consulting Group, agrees that
invention is the easy part. 'But bringing a product to commercial success is
extraordinarily hard.' This is a problem for big companies as well as
individuals and small enterprises. In his view, 'the risk associated with
innovation is due much more to incorrect market evaluation than technology
failure.'
Although the words invention and innovation are often used to mean the same
thing, there is a dividing line. An invention is an original idea or product
which may or may not be developed into something people want to buy.
Innovation is described by the Confederation of British Industry as 'the
successful exploitation of new ideas'; the definition includes not just
research and technology, but also management, marketing and training.
Nor is there a simple link between scientific discovery and economic
competitiveness. 'We need to recognise that innovation is as much market-led
as it is science-driven,' asserts Howard Newby, chairman of the Economic and
Social Research Council, an independent, government-backed body.
Thus the whole discussion about whether enough good ideas - from whichever
end of the industrial scale they stem - reach the commercial stage applies
to big as well as to small and embryonic companies. The Department of Trade
and Industry and the CBI are keen to help make UK industry more innovative.
A joint DTI/CBI study found that only one out of 10 British companies was
truly innovative, though three in 10 performed well in many aspects of the
innovative process, which it defined very widely.
Since a survey last year by CHI Research for Business Week listed no UK
companies in its worldwide ranking of the top 25 by technological strength
based on US patenting data - there were 11 each from Japan (including the
top four) and the US, two from Germany (Siemens and Hoechst), and Philips
from the Netherlands - it is clear that some form of action is required. UK
companies also rank well below foreign concerns in their spending on
research and development.
Apart from the DTI's intensified efforts to promote innovation, not just in
technology, the government also adopted a more pro-manufacturing stance in
its latest budget. But many inventors, management experts, and
industrialists - whether or not they are sceptical of the government's
efforts - believe there is a cultural anti-industrial bias in Britain which
tends to inhibit innovation and the adoption of new ideas.
This in turn, allied with the increasing difficulty of obtaining small-scale
finance, means that inventors wishing to commercialise their ideas face a
minefield of problems. 'The NIH (not invented here) syndrome was invented in
the UK,' says Paul Ambridge, a Design Council official who also chairs the
Institute of Patentees and Inventors.
Apart from deciding whether to have prototypes built, take out patents at
home and overseas, license their ideas to bigger companies, sell
shareholdings to outside investors, or simply give up when the going gets
too tough or the money runs out, inventors also have to develop an
understanding of the market. Many have no idea where to start and are liable
to run up against a wall of indifference when approaching companies.
'The general perception of an individual inventor,' says Hilary Trudeau, an
innovation consultant, 'is of someone with a propeller on their head who
spends three hours in your office and comes up with a silly idea. Some are
like that.' She has set up Support for Innovation, which sets out to screen
ideas so that only the best are presented to potential licensors.
This organisation is aimed at people with new technical or business ideas
who need to be advised on the problems of running their own business.
Licensing is probably the answer for most, she reckons. 'Most people with
technical skills would be hopeless at running a business.'
A possible solution which combines both finance and management is the
concept of 'business angels' - the commercial equivalent of 'theatrical
angels' - whereby entrepreneurs put some of their wealth back into industry
by helping new and struggling firms. This is well developed in the US, but
far less so in Britain.
'This is a vast untapped source,' believes Colin Mason, senior lecturer in
economic geography at Southampton university, who has studied this type of
financing. An additional benefit comes from the availability of management
experience as 'angels' tend to take a close interest in the operations in
which they have invested.
'I'm totally convinced that 'angels' are an idea whose time has come,' he
adds. 'They are virtually the only source of equity finance under Pounds
500,000.' However, mechanisms for putting potential (or so-called virgin)
angels in touch with those needing money are almost non-existent in the UK,
although the DTI is funding a two-year pilot scheme to set up business
introduction services.
With very little venture capital directed towards thrusting new and risky
high-technology ventures in these recessionary days, many inventors have to
turn to their high street banks. Despite the wave of recent criticism
directed at the UK clearers, however, not all inventors are dismissive of
their efforts to help. But only National Westminster has a fully fledged
Technology Unit, whose senior manager, Duncan Matthews, admits that 'banks
are technophobic'.
He, too, finds the 'business angel' concept an intriguing one and is looking
at how NatWest could play a part in helping it develop. His experience with
helping to finance technology-based companies has taught him their
potential. 'This is one area likely to have the most rapid growth.'
Sir Clive Sinclair, pioneer of the pocket calculator, the digital watch, and
the personal computer, believes the British public is receptive to new
ideas, but that finance to implement them is harder to come by than abroad.
'What is not realised by so many companies is that if they don't innovate
now, they've absolutely had it,' he believes.
His Zike electric bicycle - which looks like being more successful than the
earlier C5 electric vehicle, which flopped - is being manufactured by a
German-owned company, Tudor Webasto, whose chief executive, Alan Garnett, is
seeking new product ideas to supplement its main business of car sunroofs.
Garnett is a firm believer in innovation as a key to economic progress and
warns against the tendency to take too short term a view. 'We're in danger
in this country of getting into an almost survival-type culture where all
corporate energy is devoted to satisfying shareholders and end-year balance
sheets. We should be looking to the next generation of products.'
The series continues next week by offering practical steps for getting ideas
to market.

FT  25 MAR 93 / People: British Rail people hog the track
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Discouraging news on the rail privatisation front yesterday as former BP
boss Robert Horton named the people who will help him run Railtrack, the
government-owned company due to take over ownership and control of BR's
tracks.
Industry watchers had speculated that one of Horton's first actions as
Railtrack's chairman-designate would be to set up a management team
interposing fresh talent from the private sector among traditional railway
managers. Instead, all but one of the 11 executives named yesterday are
ex-BR - and the odd one out comes from the Department of Transport.
Few of the names are particularly well-known outside transport circles.
Chief executive will be John Edmonds (above), 56, formerly BR board member
responsible for common services such as procurement and research. Director
of major projects will be Gil Howarth, 40, who has had some prominence as
managing director of Union Railways, the BR subsidiary responsible for the
Channel tunnel rail-link project. And the odd one out is commercial director
David Moss, 46, a Grade III civil servant (under secretary) who led the
British team in the air liberalisation talks with the US.
Railtrack shrugged off criticisms about the lack of private sector input.
Several of the people chosen had spent most of their working lives in the
private sector before going to BR, it said, and all had been chosen for
their records of achievement as managers.
Mysteriously, however, we have still not been told who is to become
Railtrack's finance director, so perhaps there is room yet for a private
sector contribution.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Technology: Throwing light on Indonesia - Solar energy is
ideal for the remote islands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The village of Telaga Said in north Sumatra has progressed little. Last
century, elephants were required to transport heavy loads to it. Today, the
preferred means is a caterpillar truck.
However, Telaga Said has also been at the forefront of industrial
development. In 1895, oil was discovered in the village, giving birth to the
Royal Dutch/Shell Group. Three years ago R&amp;S, a Shell affiliate, used the
village to market an alternative energy source for rural communities - solar
power.
About 55 per cent of Indonesia's 185m people do not have access to
electricity. With the population spread over 13,000 islands the problems of
supplying electricity to the remote communities are immense. Donor agencies
estimate the cost of extending the grid off the main island of Java at up to
Dollars 3,000 (Pounds 2,000) per rural household and say the government's
rural electrification programme is responsible for losses made by PLN, the
state utility, estimated at Dollars 300m a year.
These losses are comparable to those suffered recently by the solar industry
which 'has focused 95 per cent on technological development and 5 per cent
on product development', explains R de Lange, general manager of R&amp;S in
Indonesia.
De Lange believes the future lies in supplying single 50-100 watt panels to
households. The systems, with proven reliability, can run small appliances
such as lights and radios, providing an entree for the 80 per cent of the
world's population which lack access to electricity. 'My long-term vision is
that all households could use solar energy and the government could
concentrate on commercial supply,' he says. In the current Indonesian market
of about 20,000 panels a year, companies are struggling to break even.
Jonathan Hall, manager of BP Solar in Indonesia, believes the market for
solar energy can be divided between 'high-volume single-panel systems and
high-margin niche applications'. He says more sophisticated multi-panel
units are efficient for supplying rural hospitals, telecommunication
installations and village water systems.
Companies expect both market segments to grow. With a solar home system
retailing at about Dollars 600, the government and foreign donors are taking
an interest.
A Dollars 30m World Bank loan to provide 40,000 single-panel home
installations may be forthcoming, following the recent completion of an
Indonesian government Dollars 1.65m pilot scheme which supplied 3,000 homes.
An even grander proposal, supported by the research and technology ministry,
envisions a Dollars 450m project supplying a total of 50MW over six years to
1m households.
But there are significant obstacles to these projects. Once dealer margins
are included, the systems are barely affordable. The network of local
co-operatives, through which revenue would be collected, is weak and
problems of non-payment could arise. The government's project would require
greater local content in the systems, which could lead to a loss of quality.
Foreign companies are willing to invest in manufacturing facilities in
Indonesia but only with guaranteed advance sales. In the higher-margin
bracket, BP Solar's sales include a communication system for Java's railway
network. R&amp;S is undertaking a Dollars 10m project this year to supply
30-panel systems to a further 270 health centres.
Solar energy's long-term viability, however, cannot depend on a clutch of
million-dollar, donor-financed, projects. Hall and de Lange agree more
emphasis must be paid on product and market development and less to
technological research.
Some officials speculate the industry, in its early days dominated by
significant oil conglomerates, might be better served by companies which
could use the technology to broaden their market base, such as in the sale
of cheap electronic appliances.
However, where such companies have a stake - Philips, the Dutch electronics
company, has a holding in R&amp;S and Siemens of Germany has a solar subsidiary
 -the link between solar power and product development remains weak. The
real battle may be to persuade companies that those without electricity
represent a market at all.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Keeping hold of the
customer - Companies underestimate client loyalty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies have long known that the customer is king, yet when a customer
abdicates few are aware of the event, let alone understand the reasons for
it.
Evidence from the US and the UK shows it can be up to five times cheaper to
serve existing customers than to get new ones. Yet most businesses still put
more effort into increasing the size of their market than keeping the
section they have already.
According to Price Waterhouse Management Consultants, British industry loses
Pounds 100bn a year in sales when customers defect and a similar amount in
marketing, sales and distribution expenses.
In a survey of the UK's top 200 companies Price Waterhouse found that barely
one in 10 keep tabs on how many customers leave them each year. Only one
third provide any link in staff pay to customer satisfaction, while nearly
half admit their sales forces are inadequate to meet the needs of their
existing customers.
In the US, companies are keener to monitor their clients, but are still no
closer to keeping them. According to Frederick Reichheld, of consultants
Bain and Company, most companies' attempts are ad hoc at best.
Writing in the latest Harvard Business Review, Reichheld argues that
customer loyalty should be the first building block of a business plan. Such
an approach can reap handsome rewards: MBNA, a credit card company, found a
5 per cent rise in customer loyalty increased profits by 60 per cent after
five years.
The first step is to find the right customers - those that are likely to
stay for the long haul - and also identify the wrong ones - those that are
transient or a drain on a company's resources. While it is not always easy
to spot the stayers, those who come through personal referral are usually
more loyal than those responding to an advertisement. Older people and home
owners are more likely to stay.
For each company the target group of customers will be different; the more
homogeneous the group the easier - and cheaper - it will be to address their
needs.
The next step is to develop a strategy to win this type of customer. A
cut-price promotion is almost certainly a waste of time, as it will invite
those likely to defect. Attempts to recover defectors may also backfire if
those customers are disloyal by nature.
Once it has found its target customers, a company must keep them sweet. This
involves not only a dedication to quality of product and service, but also
to serving evolving needs. One US company practised this 'lifecycle
marketing' to effect by supplying the increasingly chubby middle-aged
consumers of its fattening cakes a fat-free alternative.
Companies should take care when they monitor the customers that leave.
Somebody who stops buying dog food because the dog has died is not worth
pursuing, while one who has switched to another brand may present a serious
challenge: the company must find out why its product has been shunned.
Another way of keeping customers is to keep workers, on the grounds that
long-serving employees are more in tune with what faithful customers want.
This means being generous with pay, and structuring incentives so that
bonuses are based on customer retention and commissions on how long the
customer stays with the company. It also means choosing employees with great
care; the length of time a candidate has spent with a previous employer
could be as critical as their qualifications.
In the UK some of these ideas are being practised in insurance and financial
sectors, where companies have long treated different sorts of customers
differently. Other companies have been too keen on getting costs down to
think about much else. Yet on Price Waterhouse's evidence nine out of 10
companies recognise that customer retention should be an important part of
their strategy. It may be just a matter of time before they start to do
something about it.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Out of step on the
catwalk - The fashion show may have had its day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This time last week more than 2,000 journalists, photographers, store buyers
and socialites squeezed into a marquee in a courtyard of the Louvre museum
for the traditional highlight of the Paris fashion collections - the Chanel
catwalk show.
For years other fashion houses have tried, and failed, to trump the
theatricality of the Chanel show. But times are changing. The pressures of
recession, combined with the neo-hippy ethos of the early 1990s, has
prompted some fashion designers to reassess their attitude to fashion shows.
Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des Garcons, the Japanese designers, scaled down
their shows last week. Others, including Martin Margiela, did not stage
shows at all.
The fashion show, which lasts for around 45 minutes and costs anything up to
Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 347,000), is a critical part of a designer's
marketing strategy. It is not only their largest area of promotional
expenditure but replaces conventional advertising as their chief vehicle for
communication with the media and their retail customers.
The cost of shows escalated in the buoyant fashion market of the 1980s. The
designers were trapped in a vicious cycle of staging increasingly
spectacular shows to generate media coverage so they could reach the
ordinary consumers who bought their licensed products, such as Chanel No5
perfume and Christian Dior tights. The chief beneficiaries were the
super-models, Linda Evangelista or Claudia Schiffer, who by the late 1980s
charged up to Dollars 20,000 a show.
The industry can no longer afford such extravagance. The Paris designers'
sales fell from FFr5bn (Pounds 603m) at their 1990 peak to FFr4.3bn last
year, according to the Chambre Syndicale, which organises the Louvre shows.
Many fashion houses have serious financial problems. The latest issue of
Harper's Bazaar, the US fashion magazine, questions whether expensive shows
are justifiable in an article entitled 'Must The Show Go On?'
Ostentatious shows are also out of tune with the times. The informal
fashions of the early 1990s look lost in the huge Louvre marquees, as do the
new breed of 'wraith' models, Kate Moss and Lucie de la Falaise, who have
ousted the super-models.
Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des Garcons left the Louvre this season. 'Money
isn't the issue,' said Comme, which presented its collection in a deserted
vegetable market. 'It's a question of mood.'
Younger designers refuse to show in the Louvre as part of their rebellion
against the fashion establishment. The most fashionable events in Paris last
week were staged in night clubs, art galleries or, in the case of Xuly-Bet's
show, the toy department of the Samaritaine store.
Martin Margiela, a leading avant garde designer, went further by abandoning
his show. He presented his clothes personally in his studio and filmed his
collection in a 'home movie' video to create a 'more empathetic environment'
for his work.
Other designers may follow by cancelling or scaling down their shows. This
raises the risk that fewer journalists and buyers will come to the Paris
collections, thereby jeopardising the city's status as the international
fashion centre and imperilling the Chambre Syndicale's plan to move the
catwalk shows this autumn to a permanent complex under the Louvre.
In the long term the decline of the conventional collections may make it
more difficult for young designers to make their names on the international
scene. It could also force the established houses to spend more on
conventional marketing which could be even more expensive than fashion
shows.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Profits and the
white-collar conscience - John Gapper looks at the Co-op bank's success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most difficult problems facing British retail banks is how to
attract the right customers. The explosive growth of personal bank accounts
during the 1980s has gained banks many customers with unprofitable accounts.
They are now trying to improve the mix by being more selective.
The customer that banks want has two characteristics: he or she holds a high
balance in a current account, thus providing the bank with deposits it can
re-lend, and so paying for the cost of clearing services; and he or she is
likely to buy other products such as insurance.
This has led many banks to concentrate on 'high net-worth' individuals,
well-educated, aged 25-40, with a white-collar job paying at least Pounds
20,000 per year. The banks' marketing challenge is to devise ways of sifting
out these sort of customers.
An eclectic way of doing so has been discovered by the Co-operative Bank, a
small bank owned by Co-operative Wholesale Society. It has been running a
Pounds 1m advertising campaign in cinemas and newspapers advertising the
bank's 'ethical' stance towards selecting business. The advertisements
emphasise the bank does not deal with companies involved in blood sports,
factory farming and the production of animal furs. It also refuses financial
services to tobacco companies, cosmetics manufacturers who test products on
animals and companies that pollute.
The response to the campaign has been striking. The bank's retail deposits
rose by 13 per cent last year following the public launch of its stance last
May. Half its new customers - among a total base of 2.3m - mentioned the
ethical stance as a reason for joining the bank in its internal surveys.
The suggestion that this campaign is so neatly targeted as to be duplicitous
is greeted with a twinkle of the eye by Terry Thomas, Co-operative Bank's
managing director. 'There is certainly a very good fit. But what bank would
want to attract low income, badly-educated, ignorant people?' he says.
The idea of the Co-op having a disproportionate number of customers in the
ABC1 social bracket often provokes disbelief, because of its roots in the
early socialist movement. Yet it is well-placed because it has always
attracted public-sector professionals such as architects.
The campaign is intended to reinforce this market position and boost
products such as the gold card which it offers to high earners.
There was internal debate about making the stance public because directors
were concerned it could repel people. Thomas says it lost a few accounts
from disgruntled customers. It has also faced external challenges. The
Chemical Industries Association and the Cosmetics Association complained to
the Advertising Standards Authority about references in advertisements to
the 'spewing of toxic waste' and animal testing. Both complaints were
rejected.
Despite the hurdles, the campaign has been effective in appealing to a
precise set of customers whom most retail banks now covet. Efforts by others
to appeal to individuals with both finely tuned social consciences, and
money to spend, would not come as a surprise after the Co-op's success.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Accountancy Column: Where relationships may be too close for
independence - Prem Sikka, Anthony Puxty and Hugh Willmott on why the
provision of non-audit services to audit clients should be re-examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PREM SIKKA, ANTHONY PUXTY and HUGH WILLMOTT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE time has come to address a neglected aspect of the effectiveness of
auditors in discovering fraud: the question of their independence when they
are allowed to sell non-audit services to their audit clients.
In other European countries such as Germany, auditors must act exclusively
as auditors. But whenever this restriction is proposed in Britain, the
auditing industry argues little evidence exists to show that the provision
of non-audit services to audit clients impairs independence.
It is difficult to provide hard evidence to refute this argument. The public
is told little about company-auditor relationships, and the auditing firms
fail to publish meaningful information about their affairs.
Companies are now required to show the audit and non-audit fees generated by
auditors in their accounts. But there is nothing on topics such as the
profitability of the audit, contract details, the composition of the audit
team or how it works, which would help assess auditor independence.
Yet when accountants provide non-audit services to their audit clients,
there are many instances in which they may jeopardise the independence of
their assessment by auditing the figures of their own colleagues from the
tax, consulting or corporate finance departments.
In the aftermath of a company collapse and fraud, the quality of audits is
sometimes scrutinised through investigations by Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) inspectors. Their reports could shed some light on the
debate. Unfortunately few of these reports are published.
Even those in the public domain do not always comment on auditor
independence. On those rare occasions when they do, some reports have
concluded that the provision of non-auditing services does or may impair the
service provided.
In their 1976 report on the frauds and collapse of Roadships, for instance,
the inspectors (one of whom was a Touche Ross partner) concluded that
'independence' is destroyed when the 'work which is being audited is in fact
work which has been done previously by the auditors themselves acting as
accountants'.
The report concluded: 'We do not accept that there can be the requisite
degree of watchfulness where a man is checking either his own figures or
those of a colleague . . . For these reasons we do not believe that (the
auditors) ever achieved the standards of independence necessary for a wholly
objective audit.'
Similar concerns were expressed in the 1979 DTI report on the collapse of
Burnholme and Forder. The inspectors (one of whom was an Ernst &amp; Whinney
partner) concluded: 'In our view the principle of the auditor first
compiling and then reporting upon a profit forecast is not considered to be
a good practice for it may impair their ability to view the forecast
objectively and must endanger the degree of independence essential to this
work.'
These views at the very least challenge the assertion made by the Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in its recent response to the
McFarlane report on the future development of auditing that: 'There is no
evidence - for example in DTI inspectors' reports - that auditors'
objectivity is compromised by the provision of other services.'
Inspectors' reports have also been critical of other relationships affecting
auditor independence. One on the Grays Building Society from the Registrar
of Friendly Societies noted that auditor independence was compromised due to
the length of time served by an auditor, leading to an approach which was
described as 'mechanical and predictable'. Audit failures in a 1976 DTI
report on Hartley Baird concluded that the auditors were 'too closely
connected with' one of the directors.
There may be an expectation from the government that the accountancy bodies
will act on the findings and recommendations of DTI reports. But these
associations are in no position to control multinational auditing firms.
Their main concern is to promote and defend the work of their members.
So the inspectors' comments and recommendations have been ignored. Auditors
continue to audit the figures created by their own firms and colleagues.
This is something no other watchdogs are routinely expected, or allowed, to
do. Cosy relationships with directors are not disturbed.
In the mid 1980s, the need to implement the EC Eighth Directive - which
covered audit regulation - presented an opportunity for substantial reform.
The government issued a discussion document that included proposals for
curtailing the sale of non-auditing services by auditors. But in the face of
pressure from auditing firms, their trade associations and patrons, the
proposals were abandoned.
It was only this year, after government pressure, that the accountancy
bodies approved ethical guidelines to forbid auditors from reporting on
specialised asset valuations which they have themselves valued. These
guidelines do not currently include pension valuations. There are no other
such restrictions on the provision of services by auditors.
The ultimate responsibility for safeguarding the interests of stakeholders
lies with the DTI. Yet current ministers have shown no interest in taking
action on the provision of non-audit services.
That is in spite of comments from Mr Michael Heseltine, now secretary of
state at the DTI, in his 1987 book Where There's a Will. He argued at the
time that accountancy firms ought 'to be debarred from doing any other work
for a company for which they act as auditors . . . to prevent any possible
conflict of interest'.
The British government's attitude contrasts sharply with that in many other
countries. Consider the case of Fokus Bank in Norway. In 1991 the Norwegian
government removed its auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick, which were also
supplying substantial consultancy services. The reason, according to a
senior official, was: 'It is very questionable that an audit firm combines
its role as a key management adviser with the statutory audit function'.
Such a move is highly unlikely in Britain where the accountancy bodies are
the regulators of the auditing industry. The recent Cadbury and McFarlane
reports could have examined questions of auditor independence in detail. But
they were sponsored by the accountancy bodies and have done no such thing.
The reports make no mention of the recommendations in the DTI inspectors'
reports.
With the collapse of BCCI, the opportunity should have been taken to examine
the issue of auditor independence. But such matters were beyond the range of
Lord Justice Bingham's terms of reference. Instead, the government is
relying upon the accountancy bodies to look into the auditing aspects of the
BCCI failure.
Yet the disciplinary action taken against the large firms has been limited.
As the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry admitted to Parliament in
November 1991: 'No auditor criticised in an inspectors' report has been
debarred from auditing as a result of information in that report'.
Within the current regulatory arrangements, poor audit quality is unlikely
to be prevented. A way forward would be for the House of Commons Trade and
Industry Committee to investigate matters relating to auditor independence.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tax rises 'may not clear deficit'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY acknowl-edged yesterday that the tax rises announced in the
Budget might not be enough to wipe out the structural parts of Britain's
fiscal deficit.
Mr Chris Riley, a senior Treasury official in charge of medium-term economic
analysis, told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee it was
reasonable to assume that roughly two thirds of the deficit was cyclical or
related to the recession, with the rest being structural.
Questioned by Ms Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke
Newington, Mr Riley told the committee it was impossible to say whether the
Pounds 16bn of tax rises promised over the next three financial years would
clear the parts of the deficit deemed to be structural.
Mr Riley said there was a danger that over a period of several years some of
the cyclical parts of the deficit became structural because of the need for
the government to make large interest payments which eventually became part
of the deficit.
The Treasury expects a gap between spending and borrowing in 1993-94 of
Pounds 50bn, moving to Pounds 44bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 35bn in 1996-97.
It has not given details on how much of the deficit is cyclical rather than
structural.
Mr Riley told MPs that the Treasury had revised down its assumptions about
the UK's growth path over the next four years because of the
longer-than-expected recession, the degree of spare capacity in industry and
the sluggish state of consumer spending.
In this month's Budget, the Treasury assumed average growth of about 2.5 per
cent per year in the four financial years from 1993-94, compared with
corresponding projections of about 3.5 per cent in last year's Budget.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: A party that dares not change its
name - Political Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN before the French Socialist party's drubbing at the polls last Sunday,
Mr Michel Rocard had raised as part of his 'Big Bang' of wholesale reform
the question of his party's name.
While not coming out unequivocally for change,
the-man-who-would-be-president insisted that it was essential that a change
in the party's title was not considered a taboo subject for debate.
The French PS - fruit of a three-party coalition in 1971 - has only 22 years
of emotional baggage with which to grapple. In the UK in 1959, after four
election defeats, Labour grandees momentarily pondered the question before
roundly rejecting it.
Thirty-four years - and another four consecutive rejection slips from the
electorate - later, the issue is still not fit for discussion. Indeed, even
though the other great sacred cow - the party constitution's Clause Four
commitment to state ownership - has been prodded by Mr Jack Straw, Labour
leaders are adamant that the name is not in play.
Their main argument is simple, highly conservative and and conveniently
identical to that employed to see off any tampering with The Clause: that to
tackle the question would provoke a cataclysmic internal row.
Mr John Smith himself has echoed that reasoning. He has pointed out that
since there is no significant internal demand for changes either to Clause
Four or the party name, such unnecessary disputes should - and indeed will -
be avoided.
Undoubtedly, there is no possibility whatever that the party's name will be
changed in the foreseeable future. But that does not contradict the argument
that at a time when the party's very raison d'etre is being discussed, it is
at least odd that the product's brandname - so consistently rejected by the
electorate - is a taboo subject.
The reason after all why Mr Straw has managed to raise the question of the
clause and live to tell the tale is because some Labour party members
tacitly agree with one of his central premises. This is that, even if the
question is largely regarded as an irrelevance within the party, it still
gravely effects public perception outside. So, indeed, does Labour's name.
So what does the word, Labour, evoke? According to Mr Roy Hattersley, it
conjures 'shipbuilding, means tests and national plans'. He might have added
class conflict, unions, flat caps and the unstated pre-supposition that its
enemy is capital - Marxist associations quite as vigorous as those of Clause
Four and equally user-unfriendly to modern Britain.
Mr Hattersley makes a telling point, however, when he adds that Labour has
its positive associations too, from Beveridge to the National Health Service
and decolonisation. 'Political parties,' he concluded, 'like infantry
regiments need battle honours to lift their morale.'
In a more dismissive rejection of the case, the Fabian Society's draft
Labour constitution also invokes the warning that 'to change the name would
be a dramatic symbol that the party had disowned its history and had become
a separate and new entity'.
But is that really what it would symbolise? It could equally be argued that
the change could be promoted not as a rejection of the past, but a 'dramatic
symbol' of its radicalism and readiness to evolve with the times. What might
be disowned is not Labour's proud history, but the negative associations
evoked by the outdated class-based politics that the current leadership is
so anxious to shed.
It does not require a training in marketing to realise that any change to
the party's brand image would have to be weighed up in a balance of
advantages against disadvantages.
One of the latter would be the propaganda weapon that would be handed to the
Conservatives (another poor brand name for a party that currently promises
things are about to change for the better).
Yet a majority even among the so-called modernisers believe that the problem
is not Labour's packaging, but what is in the box. 'Turning the brand round,
not changing the name is what we should be about,' one shadow cabinet member
observed yesterday.
The most compelling reason for no change is that while Labour may be unsure
as to what it stands for now, at least it knows what it once was.
On the other hand poor corporate image, as Woolworth's management concluded
when it changed its name to Kingfisher, does have its downside too.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Poll shows Lamont's record
unpopularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE public has issued a resounding rejection of the Budget, and Mr Norman
Lamont is the most unpopular chancellor since the second world war, a poll
shows, Ivo Dawnay writes.
According to the findings of a Gallup survey for The Daily Telegraph, the
so-called 'feel good' factor has plummeted from minus 14 per cent before the
budget to minus 44 per cent, the worst figure ever recorded by the polling
organisation.
Mr Lamont's ratings now show that only 18 per cent of a weighted sample of
1,007 voters across Britain think he is doing ' a good job,' the lowest
rating for a chancellor since the question was first put in 1949. Some 70
per cent think he is not performing well.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour moves on social chapter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR has tabled a new amendment to the Maastricht bill, which could leave
the government with the choice between having to accept the social chapter
or being unable to ratify the treaty.
The amendment would prevent the ratification bill coming into force until
the House of Commons had decided whether the social chapter should apply to
the UK. This would mean a separate debate after the bill itself had
completed its parliamentary passage.
In a further threat to the government, it emerged that at a meeting on
Tuesday, Tory Euro-sceptics received legal advice which encouraged them to
seek judicial review of the attorney-general's opinion about the impact of a
separate Labour amendment.
Last month, Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, surprised MPs by
contradicting Foreign Office lawyers' advice that accepting the amendment,
which excludes the social chapter from the bill, would wreck the treaty. If
the amendment is passed, the Tory rebels are now determined to challenge his
view.
Labour is confident that its new clause on the social chapter is within
Westminster's procedural rules.
The decision about whether the Commons should debate it rests with Mr
Michael Morris, the deputy Speaker.
The new clause is being carefully studied by other opposition parties and by
Tory rebels, but it would be a tortuous process to reach the point at which
the government had to choose between not going ahead with Maastricht and
adopting the social chapter.
To get there, Tory Euro-sceptics would have to vote explicitly for the
social chapter - which they do not support - in the hope that ministers'
vehement opposition to the chapter would mean that the government would
prefer not ratifying to adopting it.
But if that were the choice, the government would come under severe pressure
from many Tory backbenchers to accept the social chapter rather than wreck
the treaty, since they believe that more jobs would be lost through a fall
in inward investment if the UK did not sign up to Maastricht than would be
lost because of the impact of the social chapter.
One possibility would be for the Tory rebels to vote for the amendment to
the bill without committing themselves on how they would vote in the
subsequent debate on the social provisions.
In the Commons itself, on the 17th day of detailed discussion of the bill,
government hopes of speeding up progress were given a boost when Liberal
Democrat MPs helped it to secure a majority of 57 to curtail a debate on the
role of the European Court of Justice.
Tory Euro-sceptics repeatedly challenged claims by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a
foreign office minister, that the court had already adapted to a less
centralised role and was taking increasing account of the views of
individual national governments.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM upbeat on 'green' targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday claimed that 'the environmental buck stops in our
backyard' and said he wanted Britain to take the lead internationally in
implementing the targets of last June's Rio Earth Summit.
Opening the Global Technology Partnership conference in Birmingham, the
prime minister announced a package of measures to help businesses adopt new
technology and to encourage energy efficiency. The UK would also publish its
plan for 'sustainable development' - one of the policies agreed at Rio - by
the end of the year, he said.
Opposition MPs and environmentalists attacked the new-technology measures as
insubstantial and said the energy efficiency schemes were not new and would
do little to cut carbon dioxide emissions.
Mr Andrew Lees of Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group,
called the speech an own-goal.
'Now that Mr Major has claimed that the buck stops here he cannot make the
UK's target of returning CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000
conditional on similar action by other countries,' Mr Lees said.
The new measures announced are:
A global technology partnership initiative 'to create a green virtuous
spiral of growth and higher environmental standards.' The scheme will run
for three years, and wants British companies to help counterparts in
industrialising countries 'to bypass old technologies and to move straight
to cleaner processes.'
A hands-on training scheme, through which the Department of Trade and
Industry will meet half of the costs of British companies offering training
to executives from companies overseas. Eligible costs include training,
including travel to and from the UK, accommodation and medical insurance.
Mr Major also drew attention to the Energy Management Assistance Scheme, in
operation since April 1992 to encourage energy efficiency in small
businesses.
Companies with up to 500 employees worldwide can apply for grants from the
Department of the Environment to cover up to 10 per cent of the costs of
energy efficiency projects which offer a good chance of achieving energy
savings of more than 10 per cent.
The department's energy efficiency office has received 1,000 applications
and payments to companies are running at Pounds 15,000 a week.
He also highlighted the Energy Saving Trust, intended to identify ways in
which the gas and electricity utilities can help householders save energy.
Mr Chris Smith, the shadow environment secretary, said: 'There is little
that is new here - it clearly does not amount to a national energy
efficiency policy'. He said the trust had been 'very slow to get off the
ground'.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Tube probe may lead to charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether to bring criminal
charges in connection with allegations of fraud at London Underground.
The CPS said yesterday it had received a report from the British Transport
Police into allegations of fraud involving London Underground fire-alarm
contracts.
According to transport police sources, the report was the result of an
18-month inquiry during which three individuals were arrested and then
released on bail. They have not been charged.
The CPS said it would have to decide whether there was sufficient evidence
for a prosecution and whether it was in the public interest to prosecute. It
would make no further comment on the case.
The fire-alarm contracts were awarded as part of a safety programme
implemented in the aftermath of the King's Cross underground station fire in
November 1987, in which 31 people died.
In his report on the fire, Mr Desmond Fennell QC, chairman of the inquiry,
criticised the lack of attention paid at the highest level to safety in
London Underground.
The programme followed the recommendations of the Fennell report and the
introduction of new statutory fire regulations throughout the London
Underground system.
It is understood that police have looked into allegations of bribes in the
award of multi-million pound contracts. London Underground has spent Pounds
200m in new fire safety installations since 1989. London Underground would
not comment yesterday on the police report.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Tesco seeks ruling on Sunday selling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TESCO and Texas Homecare were yesterday granted permission to seek judicial
review of the way two local authorities were seeking to enforce the law
against Sunday trading in England.
The companies protested that they had been targeted while smaller shops also
opening on Sundays were escaping legal action.
Mr Andrew Collins, for Tesco, the retail chain, which is challenging the
'discriminatory and invalid' policy of Kirklees Borough Council, asked: 'Why
should they pick on us and not others?'
He said the council had made clear that it would not pursue smaller traders,
but seek High Court injunctions to restrain larger stores from opening on
Sundays.
Mr Charles Bear, for Texas Homecare, the DIY group, which is challenging a
similar alleged policy by Newcastle upon Tyne city council, said: 'We have
been specifically targeted with another store. That's why we have taken this
pre-emptive action.' He told Lord Justice Watkins and Mr Justice Rougier it
was the duty of every local authority to be 'evenhanded' in enforcing Sunday
trading laws.
The judges agreed that both Tesco and Texas Homecare had an 'arguable case'.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Carey calls for commitment to urban renewal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPEATED government changes in funding arrangements for urban regeneration
programmes need to be replaced by a sustained commitment, Dr George Carey,
archbishop of Canterbury, said yesterday.
Dr Carey, on a visit to Liverpool, said the regeneration of stricken urban
areas was a long-term project, with hope and confidence gathering painfully
slowly.
'The experience of too many voluntary organisations engaged in partnerships
with government agencies in employment, training, self-help and other urban
projects has been of the tap turning on and off,' he said.
'Funding regimes have chopped and changed. Programmes have been mounted,
encouraged, cut and scrapped. Destabilising reviews of the Urban Programme
have been carried out every couple of years.'
Dr Carey said he believed many private companies would have similar
complaints.
All parties to urban regeneration partnerships needed patience and sustained
commitment to a shared task.
While recognising the financial and political pressures involved, it was
difficult to have a steady relationship with a partner who was too restless
and changeable.
'We need a more sustained and secure government contribution towards the
long haul of turning round our deep urban problems,' the archbishop said.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Charities warn on impact of recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY two thirds of Britain's charities are suffering real decreases in
income while demand for services is rising, the first study of the impact of
the recession on the voluntary sector showed yesterday.
The Charities Aid Foundation, which commissioned the survey, calculates that
charities are losing income from all sources at the rate of Pounds 1bn a
year. This means the voluntary sector's total income has fallen from about
Pounds 18bn in 1990-91 to Pounds 16bn now.
According to the survey, which covers a sample of more than 400 charities of
all sizes, 64 per cent have experienced a real decrease in income since
January 1991. More than half the charities - and 63 per cent of bigger ones
 -said the recession had affected demand for their services, in 90 per cent
of cases by increasing demand. Higher unemployment, debt problems and
local-authority cuts were cited as the main reasons for extra pressure on
charities.
Mr Michael Brophy, executive director of the foundation, said the survey
showed that social service charities had been the biggest losers in terms of
donations from the public. More than 70 per cent had reported a real
decrease in individual donations since 1991. He said decisions in the Budget
to impose value added tax on fuel bills and reduce the value of tax credits
would add to pressures on many charities. 'The voluntary sector is coming
under massive strain,' he added.
Mr Simon Hebditch, acting director of the National Council for Voluntary
Organisations, said the survey revealed a 'glaring need for new sources of
funding to be made available to help charities that support some of the most
deprived sections of our community.'
Ms Christine Carling, director of the National Association of Councils for
Voluntary Service, said it confirmed the worst fears of local voluntary
organisations. 'The demands and expectations for them to deliver services is
increasing while the funding available is decreasing.'
The survey shows that one in seven charities has cut services. One in eight
is charging for services that were previously free and a similar number have
made staff redundant. One fifth said they were cancelling or deferring
capital expenditure.
Charity managers told the survey that - apart from providing more money -
local authorities could help by paying fees on time and simplifying funding
applications, while the government should do more to publicise the work of
the voluntary sector.

FT  25 MAR 93 / MPs demand big shake-up for forestry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL REFORM of forestry policy was urged yesterday by the Commons
environment committee.
More than 50 recommendations are made in its report on forestry and the
environment, including a shake-up in the structure of ministerial
responsibility.
'We did not take evidence specifically on a combined ministry for
environment, agriculture and rural affairs, but we believe that the creation
of such a body should be one of the options examined,' says the committee,
which is concerned that divisions of responsibility create barriers to
effective policymaking.
The lead ministry at present is the Scottish Office, which shares control
with the Welsh Office and the agriculture ministry. The committee calls for
a national forestry strategy reflecting the 'very different situations in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland'. The strategy should set out
what kind of forests are needed and why, as well as how existing forests
should be protected and managed.
As the UK imports nearly 90 per cent of its timber, the strategy should also
take into account the international aspects of forestry, the timber trade
and agricultural and land use policies.
In particular, the report urges the government to keep pressure on the
European Community to allow tree planting on land set aside from other crops
under the EC's Common Agricultural Policy.
'It is essential that the UK develops a coherent national strategy that
delivers good quality forestry for a variety of different purposes,' Mr
Robert Jones, committee chairman, said yesterday. 'These objectives must be
set within an international framework to ensure that forests play their
integral role in helping combat the problems caused by greenhouse gases.'
The concept of 'multi-purpose' forestry to satisfy environmental and social
as well as economic demands will also require a complete overhaul of the
existing plethora of grants. The report suggests that the role of all
interested public bodies should be reviewed in order to reduce duplication
of effort.
Witnesses commented at length that the government had been not been specific
on plans to privatise the Forestry Commission. The general feeling was that
the recent division of the commission - into a regulatory Forest Authority
and Forest Enterprise to manage plantations  - should be given time to work.
The committee says Forest Enterprise should be redirected away from its
domination by commercial forestry towards 'a more dynamic role in creating,
buying and managing multi-purpose forestry'.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Probe uncovers police racism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE that managers in the police force are ignoring cases of serious
sexual harassment and are even joining in 'racist banter' has been uncovered
by an official investigation into equal opportunities in the police service,
published yesterday by the Home Office.
Strong evidence that women police offers were 'suffering persistent
low-level harassment unchecked by supervisors', was found by Her Majesty's
Inspectorate of Constabulary.
The inspectorate also found 'evidence of personal physical harassment which
had been brought to the attention of supervisors and had not been dealt
with'.
Some senior managers were not prepared to recognise harassment as a problem
and victims had no faith that grievance procedures would protect them from
further victimisation and isolation by their colleagues, according to the
investigation.
The study was based on a sample of 12 of the 43 forces in England and Wales,
and covered more than 35,000 officers out of a total of 127,000. 12 per cent
of police officers in England and Wales are women. Interviews were held with
police officers and civilian employees of all grades.
The inspectors report that during the meetings with officers, including
supervisors, 'it was obvious that an underlying level of racist banter was
accepted; supervisors were unprepared to challenge or, worse, were prepared
to join in'.
The report says that one force collected no data on recruitment, while in
another there was a wide disparity one year between failure rates for male
applicants (56.5 per cent) and female applicants (73.2 per cent). The report
notes: 'Of equal concern, the force was unable to offer any explanation for
this.'
Study of recruitment literature found 'a considerable domination of white
male images', and there was little evidence of special efforts being made to
attract ethnic minorities to the forces inspected.
There was no evidence of specialist posts being officially closed to women
or ethnic minorities, although women were found to be 'seriously
underrepresented in mainstream CID posts', the report notes.
A small number of women interviewed 'thought the pendulum of equal
opportunities had swung too far and that men were being discriminated
against, particularly in terms of promotion', it concludes.

FT  25 MAR 93 / BP defends oil tax from attacks: Rig owners reject BP claims
 -Warning of further closures / Capacity exceeds orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum yesterday attacked claims by other oil operators that tax
changes announced by the chancellor in the Budget would severely curtail
North Sea activity.
But oil rig owners said yesterday that four drilling programmes had already
been cancelled since last Tuesday, when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
proposed to reduce the rate of petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50
per cent, and to abolish tax allowances for exploration and appraisal work.
Today representatives from Amerada Hess, the North Sea exploration company,
are to meet Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury. The
company, one of the most active in North Sea exploration, has threatened to
halve its exploration programme this year if the government insists on its
proposed changes to the tax regime.
The divergent views of the winners and losers in the largest overhaul of
North Sea taxes for 10 years are generating a serious row in the oil
industry over how to respond to Mr Lamont's proposals.
Mr John Browne, ex-ploration director at BP, said the attacks on the
proposed changes by the UK Offshore Operators' Association, the industry
group, were 'hasty and inappropriate.'
Mr Browne said the tax reforms were overdue. The taxpayer had spent 30 years
subsidising what has sometimes been wasteful oil exploration. BP says the
proportion of wells drilled which result in commercial oil finds has dropped
in the past five years from one in four to one in seven.
The proposals would give exploration work a stronger focus and make it more
cost-effective, he said, and the reduction in the tax rate for existing
fields would encourage companies to improve recovery of oil.
'Even the most efficient fields leave 40 per cent of the oil in the ground.
Many of those older fields would be nearing depletion by the end of the
decade. They will now have a longer life,' he said.
One analyst estimated that the industry as a whole could recover 500m to 1bn
barrels from existing fields given the incentive of lower taxes.
BP is a net beneficiary of the changes - analysts estimate they could add as
much as Pounds 140m a year to its profits. The company has the third-largest
drilling programme in the North Sea and is set to spend Pounds 90m on
exploration this year.
Mr Browne said much more oil could be recovered from existing fields than
will be found in small discoveries of 10m to 20m barrels. He said the
changes would help bring new areas, such as the recent west-of-Shetlands
discovery, on stream more quickly.
However, owners of drilling rigs have written to Mr John Major, the prime
minister, and to Mr Lamont warning of the consequences of the proposals. Mr
Mike Salter, chief executive of Smedvig, a drilling rig operator, and
chairman of the British Rig Owners Association, said the proposals would
increase the number of rigs idle and crews out of work.
He said 40 per cent of drilling rigs in the North Sea were already idle.
Exploration work fell 32 per cent last year because of low oil prices and
high costs.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Budget adds to depression over the North Sea: Rig
manufacturers are braced for hard times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT by Amerada Hess to halve its North Sea oil exploration programme
bodes ill for Britain's offshore oil and gas fabricators.
Amerada, a leading North Sea exploration company, has threatened the cut if
the government goes ahead with Budget proposals for changes in the petroleum
revenue tax regime.
Rig manufacturers have already seen a big drop in work since last autumn.
Two thirds of the 18,000 workers employed six months ago in fabricators'
yards have lost their jobs. One yard has been mothballed.
Further rationalisation and closures are inevitable, says the industry, with
capacity running well ahead of orders. The situation could be made even
worse if oil producers reduce exploration fur-ther.
Some fabricators may be forced to pull out of the market - even if the
government decides not to favour coal at the expense of gas production in
the energy white paper expected today.
The industry believes that up to half the 12 yards operated by the seven
largest fabricators - Amec Offshore, Highlands Fabricators, McDermott
Scotland, Redpath, RGC, SLP and UIE Scotland - may be vulnerable.
Mr Syd Fudge, chairman of the Offshore Manufacturers and Constructors
Association, which represents the seven fabricators, fears that the few
remaining opportunities for British companies to tender for North Sea work
may be reduced even further as a result of the government's policies.
Mr John Walmesley, finance director of Enterprise Oil, says the effect of
Budget tax proposals would be to take away much of the incentive to
re-invest earnings in new projects in the North Sea.
Under the Budget proposals, extraction from existing fields will become more
economic while operators will no longer be able to offset exploration costs
against the profits from existing fields.
The changes could not have come at a worse time for fabricators. A large
drop in orders had been expected as the level of North Sea construction,
which had been strongly in manufacturers' favour in the late 1980s and early
1990s, began to drop.
Investment emphasis is likely to change - most of the large, more easily
exploited oil and gas fields were discovered when oil prices were equivalent
to Dollars 40 to Dollars 50 a barrel at today's prices. But yesterday's
price was just Dollars 18.60 a barrel.
Future fields are likely to be smaller, more complex and more costly to
develop, say producers. The recession, and the fact that oil prices are not
expected to rise substantially in real terms, will limit further spending.
Investment, they say, is more likely to be in repair and maintenance rather
than in the construction of large new rigs. Production facilities are likely
to be smaller, with new units hooking up to existing, larger production
platforms.
That will mean less need for large assembly yards, many of which are in the
former shipbuilding areas of north-east England and Scotland.
Numbers employed in the yards since September have fallen from more than
18,000 to approaching 6,000. Turnover of Pounds 1.5bn last year is likely to
fall to just Pounds 500m this year.
McDermott, the US owner of the Ardersier yard near Inverness, and one of
northern Scotland's biggest employers, has announced redundancy for most of
its remaining 500 workers. The yard, which 18 months ago employed 3,500
people, has run out of orders.
Closures and the shift in work to care and maintenance, as in the case of
Ardersier, will damage local economies further. The three yards operated by
Amec at Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, generated a turnover of Pounds 200m last
year of which Amec estimates 80 per cent is spent in the local economy. This
year turnover is likely to be nearer Pounds 100m - indicating a net loss to
the community of about Pounds 80m.
Companies are looking to overseas work to offset the decline in UK orders.
In most cases this will involve selling management expertise rather than
providing employment for British workers and suppliers of materials and
components. The exception is for work for the Norwegian sector of the North
Sea but competition is tough and tends to favour the home players.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZURICH INSURANCE expects to pay about Pounds 70m for Municipal Mutual
Insurance's local authority and some other insurance business, it emerged
yesterday.
Neither Zurich nor MMI, the local authority-owned insurer that withdrew from
the market last year, would previously disclose financial details of the
deal, completed this month.
Mr Maurice Stonefrost, MMI chairman, told an extraordinary general meeting
that Zurich would pay about Pounds 50m for the new insurance businesses,
although the exact amount would be linked to the level of business written
by Zurich over three years. Zurich would also pay MMI Pounds 20m to acquire
the net assets.
MMI retains financial liability for all claims arising on business
underwritten before September 30 1992.
It proposes that its members (also its biggest policyholders) approve a
directors' voluntary scheme of arrangement, averting the need for
provisional liquidation should assets be insufficient to meet liabilities.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Summer sell-off for Ulster electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity will go ahead early this
summer in a sale likely to raise about Pounds 300m, Michael Smith writes.
The sale of NIE will complete the privatisation of the Northern Ireland
electricity industry, which started last April with the sale of four power
stations.
The decision follows European Community approval of a Pounds 60m grant
towards a Pounds 200m investment programme for a new power line from
Scotland.
Uncertainty about the grant last year held up the flotation.
Completion of the privatisation of the non-nuclear electricity industry is
likely next year when the government is expected to sell its remaining 40
per cent stakes in PowerGen and National Power.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Barclays acts faster against stolen cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPUTER system which is designed to block fraudsters as they attempt to
misuse Barclaycards will be launched by Barclays bank on April 1.
The system is the first of its kind and aims to reduce credit card crime.
Last year Barclays, the largest issuer, accounting for up to 40 per cent of
the UK market, suffered worldwide losses from credit card fraud of Pounds
31.1m, down from the peak of Pounds 33m in 1991. Total plastic card fraud in
the UK last year amounted to Pounds 165m.
The new computer system - known as Fraud 2000 - will first compare the
purchase being made to a number of common indicators of card fraud, such as
the number of transactions made in one day or the amount being spent.
If its electronic eyebrows are raised, it will then compare the purchase
with the normal pattern of spending by the customer. Barclays says this
process will take only one fifth of a second.
If it still senses that fraud is involved, it will alert Barclaycard's
24-hour fraud referral unit. A member of staff will speak to the customer
over the telephone and will alert police during the conversation if they
decide that the card is being used fraudulently. In most cases, Barclays
expects the criminal to leave and abandon the stolen card. But it also hopes
the system will lead to 20 arrests a day.
The bank predicts that its losses from credit card fraud will be brought
down by Pounds 4m in the system's first year. 'The difference is that we are
analysing the data live,' said Barclays. 'Our existing Fraudwatch computer
system spots unusual changes in cardholders' spending patterns once we
receive the vouchers from the retailer, but that means we are always a few
days behind.'
'Unusual' behaviour includes using the card frequently where it had been
used sparsely before, making purchases of televisions and videos more than
once within a short period or buying at shops not usually visited by the
customer. Barclays says that the information is not used for marketing
purposes, but solely to detect fraud.
The system will be operable only in the 20 per cent of transactions in which
banks are contacted for authorisation.
Barclays says it aims to increase the number of authorised transactions to
one in four this year and to half the number of transactions by 1996.
However, the Consumers' Association, while welcoming the initiative
yesterday, said it was concerned that bona fide customers could find
themselves in potentially embarrassing situations if they had to give
identification details in front of other customers over the telephone.
Barclays said yesterday that this was unlikely. 'The last thing we would
want is to lose the goodwill of our customers,' it added.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Court blow to contracting-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE High Court yesterday delivered a further blow to the government's
contracting-out programme when it declared that the Transfer of Undertakings
Regulations (Tupe) did apply to a prison education service being transferred
from a Local Education Authority.
The Brussels-inspired Tupe regulations aim to protect the pay and conditions
of employees when undertakings are transferred from one employer to another.
But there is wide disagreement about precisely when Tupe applies in
contracting-out.
The Home Office had advised that Tupe would not apply in the case of prison
education services, and education providers had tendered on that basis.
Yesterday's judgement from Sir Michael Ogden that Tupe did apply in the case
of Kenny versus South Manchester College contradicts that Home Office
advice.
Lawyers also said it casts doubt on the recent guidance from Mr William
Waldegrave, the public service minister, who said Tupe would not normally
apply when the new employer conducts the operation without making
significant use of previous staff, premises or equipment.
The case was brought by two members of the college lecturers' union Natfhe,
Mr Peter Kenny and Ms Helen Woodruff. They were challenging the fact that
South Manchester College, which has won the contract to provide education at
the Thorn Cross Young Offenders Institute, was not committed to taking on
staff who had been providing the education and were offering different
contracts.
South Manchester College, which may appeal, will now have to take on staff
who had been employed by Cheshire County Council and on the same terms and
conditions.
The prison service will have to meet demanding performance targets when it
becomes a semi-autonomous agency in a week's time, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
home secretary, said last night.
He made it clear that he expected standards to improve but warned that there
would be no extra resources and stressed the need for more efficient working
practices.

FT  25 MAR 93 / MPs criticise Revenue over 'adjudicator'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs yesterday launched a strong attack on the Inland Revenue over its
appointment of an 'independent adjudicator' to deal with complaints from
taxpayers.
Members of the Commons committee on the parliamentary commissioner - or
ombudsman - accused the Revenue at a committee hearing of creating a
function which was duplicative, confusing and had the potential to deceive
the public.
Mr William Reid, the parliamentary commissioner, said using the word
'independent' seemed to him 'like a slightly faulty description of goods'.
He added: 'The only truly independent individual is myself. The Revenue's
adjudicator is not as independent as I am.'
Mr James Pawsey, Conservative chairman of the committee, said: 'This
position is set up by the board (of the Inland Revenue), reports to the
board and is staffed by the board.' He asked: 'Is it not truly misleading to
call it independent?'
Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the board of the Revenue, said there was
no intention to mislead the public. 'I think you are being prematurely
unkind to the adjudicator.' But, under pressure from committee members, Sir
Anthony started to use the word 'dispassionate' during the hearing in place
of 'independent'.
He agreed to review literature produced by the board which used the phrase
'independent adjudicator', and to examine criticisms from MPs that the
documents did not make sufficiently clear that the public could ultimately
turn to the ombudsman for redress.
He said he would encourage the adjudicator to hire his own staff in place of
Revenue officers once the post was operating. But he stressed that the
Revenue's internal complaints procedures were fair and 'terribly fierce'
against staff.
He said the Revenue received about 15,000 complaints last year, and that
about 10,000 led to compensation or abandonment of the pursuit of tax.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Mothballing six pits may cost up to Pounds 24m a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, DAVID OWEN and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Coal may have to spend up to Pounds 24m a year to keep open mines it
does not want if expected recommendations for mothballing pits are included
in today's white paper.
It costs between Pounds 2m and Pounds 4m a year to mothball a pit. Ministers
are expected to recommend that up to six pits which would otherwise close be
kept in a condition that would allow them to reopen.
British Coal is also likely to have to maintain the 10 pits it wants to
close immediately in operational condition for several months. This would
cost about Pounds 13m a month in total. Unless the government agreed to pay
both the mothballing and maintenance costs, the corporation would have to
foot the bill.
The National Union of Mineworkers is expected to oppose the white paper with
a campaign of industrial action. Its members are due to strike for 24 hours
on April 2 in protest at threatened compulsory redundancies.
Other mining unions are unlikely to support the white paper if it involves
only a maximum two-year reprieve for 13 of the 31 threatened pits with the
rest closing at once. But the Union of Democratic Mineworkers is opposed to
industrial action.
The Trades Union Congress said it intended to hold an emergency meeting of
its energy committee tomorrow if the white paper fails to save all the pits.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Bank hints it should lose 'protector' role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England hinted yesterday that its role as protector of bank
depositors should be devolved to an outside institution.
In a speech on bank supervision, Mr Brian Quinn, the director in charge of
supervision, said that present arrangements for supervising and regulating
banks 'may have to be reconsidered'.
Although his speech gives few details on this issue, it is understood that
Mr Quinn believes there is a distinction to be drawn between his
department's two main functions: the protection of the financial system and
the protection of depositors.
Under the 1979 and 1987 Banking Act, the Bank has explicit responsibility
for both functions. However, he said that the depositor protection function
has encouraged bank customers to believe that 'the banking supervisor is
there to protect them from every deficiency they experience - or perceive -
in the service they get from their bank'.
But he was adamant this was not his role: 'I have to say that the role of
the banking supervisor is to seek to enforce prudent conduct by banks, not
customer satisfaction.'
Mr Quinn stressed that the bank is a supervisor but not a regulator. He
defined regulation as the process of ensuring that financial institutions
follow appropriate rules when selling financial products, to protect
consumers from buying bad or unsuitable products.
The Securities and Investments Board and the self-regulatory organisations
act as regulators of banks when they sell non-deposit products and services,
such as life policies or shares.
But there is a regulatory vacuum in deposit taking and lending services.
Mr Quinn is understood to believe that there is an argument for giving the
Bank's deposit-protection functions to an outside body - though not until
the present reorganisation of the regulation of investment and life products
is completed. However, he did not make this view explicitly in the speech.
He did argue that the Bank should retain its role as supervisor, in the
sense of ensuring that there is the minimum risk of a collapse in the
payments system. Although he said that there is a potential conflict between
the Bank's role as the executor of monetary policy and its role as
supervisor, he believes that there are advantages to combining the
functions.
Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, said for the first
time that his bank would join the Personal Investment Authority, the
proposed new regulator of the retail investment industry,
if the PIA could demonstrate that it would be an efficient and effective
regulator.
The Bank of England yesterday supported the winding up of a small company
which had been operating illegally as a bank and is thought to have taken
deposits of about Pounds 1m. The Bank supported a petition in the High Court
from the landlords of General Credit Finance. It said it wanted to hear from
depositors of GCF.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Relief over polluted land decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE withdrawal of the government's plans to introduce a contaminated land
register was greeted yesterday with widespread relief tempered by
uncertainty about what might replace it.
Businesses, developers and local authorities had been convinced that the
proposed registers would blight land, depress land prices and be a severe
setback to urban regeneration. Pressure on the government to withdraw its
proposals came from groups ranging from the Confederation of British
Industry to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. 'We are delighted that the
proposals have been withdrawn. They would have had a disastrous effect on
many small businesses,' said Mr Marco Torquati of the Association of British
Chambers of Commerce.
But some critics believed the government's announcement of a 'new
wide-ranging review of the problems in this area' would merely prolong the
uncertainty that has damaged the property market.
'We were expecting a firm announcement at this stage,' said Mr Michael
Chambers of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. 'This is rather a
disappointment. There will now be a long period of uncertainty.'
Mr Chris Smith, Labour's spokesman on the environment, said a third round of
consultation and review meant the government had given no sign of fulfilling
its legal obligation under the Environmental Protection Act of 1990. 'It
leaves still a considerable amount of uncertainty,' he said.
After two consultations, the government has collected the views of some 400
environmentalists, landowners and consultants involved in the debate.
The review will consider the powers and duties of public authorities
relating to contaminated land, the mechanisms for recovering authorities'
costs in remedying pollution, the statutory changes needed and whether any
longer-term studies should be put in place.
Some commentators believe the principle of the register should be salvaged.
Mr Smith said he did not want to see the principle of a register thrown away
completely. 'I want to see a proper register that allows land to be taken
off it.' Otherwise, he said, the entire burden of assessing whether land was
fit for development would fall on local authorities.

FT  25 MAR 93 / East Thames area to be developed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TASK force to spearhead development of the East Thames corridor, a rundown
swathe of riverside east of London, is to be set up to boost long-term
economic growth and create thousands of jobs.
The announcement of the plan yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary, was in sharp contrast to the vision of Mr Michael Heseltine, when
he was environment secretary, of a linear city on both sides of the Thames.
Mr Howard said the first stage would be consultative. There was no question
of blocking development to the west of London, and ribbon development at the
expense of the environment would not be allowed.
However, there was a need to plan for the long term beyond the recession,
and the 30-mile corridor on both sides of the Thames from Docklands to
Tilbury and Sheerness could become the bridgehead to the Continent.
The newly created task force will prepare a planning framework for the
corridor, which should be available for public consultation by the end of
the year. The intention is to have the framework in place by March next
year.
One of the problems is to create cohesion among the 16 local authorities
covering the corridor. These include parts of six London boroughs, part of
Thurrock in Essex, and the Kent authorities of Dartford, Gravesham,
Rochester, Gillingham and Swale.
Development plans are likely to come under attack for a variety of reasons.
The area contains some of the most derelict and hazardous wastelands in the
country, but it also has some important wildlife sites.
Mr Howard acknowledged that contamination on some sites could be a problem,
and emphasised the need to develop the corridor 'to safeguard its
internationally important wildlife habitat'.
The intention is to avoid the mistakes made in Docklands by ensuring
development of the corridor coincides with a big infrastructure programme.
Mr Howard published a list of projects in addition to the Channel tunnel
rail link, including the promised Jubilee Line, extensions to the Docklands
Light Railway, improvements to the railway services to Tilbury and Southend,
and upgraded road links.
The Association of London Authorities said it was essential that
improvements to the infrastructure were carried out at all stages.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said it was a much-needed boost
to the economy of the south-east.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Replacement of press watchdog urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMONS national heritage committee yesterday entered the debate on
privacy and the press by publishing 43 recommendations intended to curb
excessive media intrusion into individuals' private lives.
The committee's report says that while a free society requires the freedom
to say and print items inconvenient to those in authority, all individuals
are entitled to a 'zone of privacy'.
Although the committee says prominent figures - such as royalty,
politicians, media personalities, business and sports celebrities - cannot
expect the same privacy rights as the general public, they must be allowed
to keep aspects of their lives out of the public gaze.
The report's main concern is with ordinary citizens, particularly innocent
victims of crime, who are caused additional distress by media attention.
The report severely criticises the Press Complaints Commission, the industry
watchdog. It suggests there have been many more breaches of the press code
of conduct than have been reported to the commission, which is faulted for
refusing to accept complaints from third parties and for not monitoring
press behaviour.
The committee argues that the commission should be replaced by a press
commission with more extensive powers to punish breaches of the code. The
code should be amended to refer to an 'area of privacy' as a fundamental
right and to delete references to anti-social conduct.
The report rejects the idea of a statutory press complaints tribunal, as
recommended by Sir David Calcutt in his recent review of press regulation.
'Unless future events show such a tribunal to be utterly unavoidable . . it
would be far preferable to rely on voluntary regulation.'
It calls instead for a protection of privacy law, which would make it a
civil offence to obtain or publish harmful or embarrassing personal
information and photographs, and persistently to intrude on individuals'
privacy.
Legislation would also make electronic bugging, unauthorised photography and
trespass criminal offences as the government has already pledged. In
addition, the report calls for intrusive surveillance devices to be
registered or licensed.
Legal aid should be available for actions brought under the legislation and
extended to cover defamation.
Civil and criminal offences could be defended on the grounds of public
interest, which would include preventing or exposing crime, protecting
health and safety and 'informing the public about matters directly affecting
the discharge of any public functions of the individual concerned'.
The proposed commission should be charged with upholding press freedom and
be able to enforce the code of practice by ordering the publication of
corrections, requiring the payment of compensation and fining offenders.
The new commission, says the report, should also set up a complaints
hotline, establish regional offices, conduct regular research into public
attitudes to the press and initiate inquiries into the industry.
The commission should be backed up by a government-funded press ombudsman,
accountable to parliament. The ombudsman could take similar measures to
enforce the code of practice, but would have statutory powers and the right
to refer cases to the High Court.
The report also adds that voluntary regulation of the press should be
strengthened by adherence to the code of practice part of editors' and
journalists' contracts.
Privacy and Media Intrusion, HMSO, Pounds 12.15.
MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE
A protection of privacy bill to prohibit obtaining and publishing harmful,
unauthorised or inaccurate information, and persistent intrusion of privacy.
Unauthorised eavesdropping and trespass to obtain personal information to be
made criminal offences.
Legal aid for libel actions brought under the bill and for defamation cases.
Replacement of Press Complaints Commission by a Press Commission, with
authority to enforce the press code of practice by fining offenders and
requiring payment of compensation.
Appointment of a publicly-funded press ombudsman with statutory power to
order corrections and apologies, fines and compensation and the right to
refer cases to the High Court.
Intrusive surveillance devices to be licensed or registered.
Compliance with code of practice to be written into employment contracts of
editors.

FT  25 MAR 93 / College teachers back strike call
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COLLEGE teachers in England and Wales have voted to hold a 24-hour strike on
April 1 with a further one-day stoppage on April 28 in protest at threats in
194 colleges to introduce terms and conditions of employment for new staff
which they believe will be inferior.
Members of the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher
education backed strike action with 86 per cent saying they would support
action short of a stoppage.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Clothing trade deficit 'at peak'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S trade deficit in clothing and textiles reached a record Pounds
3.8bn in 1992, almost one third of the total trade deficit, a report says
today.
Imports rose 7 per cent to Pounds 8.6bn as overseas manufacturers took
advantage of the strength of sterling before it left the European exchange
rate mechanism in September, says the report from the Apparel Knitting and
Textiles Alliance, the industry body.
The strongest rise in imports was in clothing - 18 per cent up in the final
quarter compared with 1991. But the orders for those deliveries were placed
before sterling's fall. Exports rose more slowly than imports but
nevertheless reached a record of Pounds 4.8bn, up 6 per cent on 1991.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Call to centralise securities regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE regulation of securities markets should be centralised under the
Securities and Investments Board, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the
London Stock Exchange, said yesterday, Richard Waters writes.
He appealed for a solution to the fragmented regulation built around the
recognised investment exchanges and self-regulatory organisations.
Sir Andrew called for a central database to hold details of all securities
transactions in the UK. SIB should take over investigating and prosecuting
cases extending beyond the remit of any single investment exchange or
self-regulatory body, he said.
Sir Andrew's remarks appear to stem in part from the exchange's experience
in trying to investigate insider dealing.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Bank suggests shedding its 'protector' role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England hinted yesterday that its role as protector of bank
depositors should be devolved to an outside institution.
In a speech on bank supervision, Mr Brian Quinn, the director in charge of
supervision, said that current arrangements for supervising and regulating
banks 'may have to be reconsidered'.
Although his speech gives few details on this issue, it is understood that
Mr Quinn believes there is a distinction to be drawn between his
department's two main functions: the protection of the financial system and
the protection of depositors.
Under the Banking Act, the Bank has explicit responsibility for both
functions. However, he said that the depositor protection function has
encouraged bank customers to believe that 'the banking supervisor is there
to protect them from every deficiency they experience - or perceive - in the
service they get from their bank'.
But he was adamant this was not his role: 'I have to say that the role of
the banking supervisor is to seek to enforce prudent conduct by banks, not
customer satisfaction'.
Mr Quinn stressed that the bank is a supervisor but not a regulator. He
defined regulation as the process of ensuring that financial institutions
follow appropriate rules when selling financial products, to protect
consumers from buying bad or unsuitable products.
Mr Quinn is understood to believe that there is an argument for giving the
Bank's deposit protection functions to an outside body - though not until
the current reorganisation of the regulation of investment and life products
is completed. However he did not make this view explicitly in the speech.
He did, however, argue that the Bank should retain its role as supervisor,
in the sense of ensuring that there is the minimum risk of a collapse in the
payments system. Although he said that there is a potential conflict between
the Bank's role as the executor of monetary policy and its role as
supervisor, he believes that there are advantages in combining the
functions.
The execution of monetary policy would be impossible if there were problems
with the payments system.
For the first time he made explicit the circumstances in which the Bank acts
as a lender of last resort to a bank. He said that the Bank will only pump
money into a bank if it is 'too important to fail'.
He said that a bank would be allowed to collapse, no matter how big it is,
so long as that collapse did not put the financial system at risk: 'There is
no 'too big to fail' doctrine in the United Kingdom'.
Mr Quinn spoke at a conference on City regulation.
At the same conference, Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster
Bank, said for the first that his bank would join the Personal Investment
Authority, the proposed new regulator of the retail investment industry,
if the PIA could demonstrate that it will be an efficient and effective
regulator.

FT  25 MAR 93 / MPs mollified while the industry seethes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE press reform proposals yesterday won the backing of MPs who have been
demanding press reform - and were greeted with outrage by the industry.
Most newspapers said they welcomed the recommendations for greater public
access to information but they stressed that the plan to introduce a privacy
bill and to create a statutory press ombudsman and a Press Commission with
powers to fine newspapers would be unwelcome and unworkable.
Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP whose private Freedom and Responsibility of
the Press Bill returns to the Commons next month, broadly welcomed many of
the proposals.
But he criticised the report's failure to recommend a statutory press
watchdog. 'We are in danger here of buying the press another round in the
Last Chance Saloon,' he said.
Sir Frank Rogers, chairman of the Newspapers Publishers Association and
deputy chairman of The Telegraph group, said: 'They are suggesting the
imposition of a statutory body extremely similar to the Calcutt report
recommendations. It is an extraordinary document - diffuse and even
incoherent.'
Echoing a widespread criticism by the press of the proposed privacy bill,
Sir Frank said: 'If a privacy bill can be constructed it will be extremely
difficult to operate. It's impossible to create anything that would work. A
lot of lawyers have tried and failed.'
He stressed that the privacy bill was not the main bone of contention. 'The
main issue is the statutory body,' he said.
Ms Patsy Chapman, editor of the News of the World, said: 'It looks to me
like layer upon layer of red tape. It doesn't give the industry any credit
for having improved its procedure.'
Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the
self-regulatory body, condemned the planned new body and said that the
proposal for a privacy bill was unworkable.
'I am exceedingly shocked by the extent to which public business is being
conducted by slovenly procedures,' said Lord McGregor, who claimed that the
select committee's report had ignored the government's previous research on
the newspaper industry.
The report's proposal for a system of statutory fines drew criticism across
the board, but plans to control press intrusion drew a more mixed response.
Lord McGregor welcomed the proposal that reporters should identify
themselves, and inform interviewees of their rights.
But Mr Chris Davis, assistant editor of The Sun, said: 'It's basically the
establishment and the MPs trying to look after themselves. We will continue
to harass MPs for breakfast, lunch and dinner.'

ezuela's public sector deficit was expected to fall to 3.4 per cent of GDP
from more than 6 per cent last year, Mr Ricardo Hausmann, minister of

Pressure on the beleaguered government of President Carlos Andres Perez has
prompted further efforts this year to reduce official spending and boost
revenues. The government had already promised cuts of 20 per cent in public
spending.
Taxes and royalties on petroleum exports, the main source of the Venezuelan
government's revenues, have fallen dramatically in recent years as exports
have declined.
The Perez administration is also hoping it can raise extra revenues from
privatisation.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Greenspan cautions on tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, yesterday stepped into
the political debate about deficit reduction by urging greater reliance on
spending cuts than on tax increases.
The federal budget deficit was a 'malignant force' that was threatening the
economy's stability, Mr Greenspan said. He warned Congress not to rely too
heavily in the long run on tax increases which 'by their very nature
restrain business activity'.
He was testifying on Capitol Hill following the release of official figures
showing an increase in new orders for durable goods of 2.2 per cent last
month and 14.5 per cent in the year to February - another sign recovery is
on track.
Mr Greenspan has previously argued that the Fed should stay aloof from
political wrangles about the relative merits of tax increases and spending
cuts - decisions which are the responsibility of Congress and the White
House.
Without challenging specific elements of the administration's economic plan,
Mr Greenspan yesterday appeared to lend support to Republican critics
arguing for greater spending restraint.
He said senators should recognise that 'trying to wholly, or substantially,
address a structural budget deficit by increasing revenues is fraught with
exceptional difficulties, and is more likely to fail than to succeed'.
From 1997, budget outlays were set to rise appreciably faster than the tax
base. 'If such trends aren't altered, stabilising the deficit-GDP ratio
solely from the receipts side, not to mention reducing it, will necessarily
require ever-increasing tax rates.' This would inevitably damp long-term
growth prospects.
Addressing possible reforms of the budgetary process, Mr Greenspan rejected
a balanced budget amendment to the constitution because it would probably
prove impossible to enforce. Instead, he favoured a constitutional amendment
stipulating that 'all revenue and spending initiatives require
super-majorities - for example, 60 per cent - to pass both houses of the
Congress'.
If combined with 'sunset legislation' imposing explicit termination dates
for spending programmes, this might help 'neutralise the obvious propensity
of our political system toward structural deficits'.
The increase in durable goods orders was larger than expected on Wall Street
but mainly reflected a 10.9 per cent surge in orders for transport goods
which tend to be volatile on a monthly basis. Excluding transport, orders
fell slightly.
Orders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as the best
guide to underlying civilian investment trends - rose just over 2 per cent
last month and by 15 per cent in the past year.

<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S public sector deficit was expected to fall from 3.4 per cent of
GDP from more than 6 per cent last year, Mr Ricardo Hausmann, minister of
planning, said yesterday.
The deficit is being reduced through a series of measures, including cuts in
state spending and increased charges for public services.
Pressure on the beleaguered government of president Carlos Andres Perez has
prompted further efforts this year to reduce official spending and boost
revenues. This is in spite of government promises in its original budget of
real cuts of about 20 per cent in public spending.
Taxes and royalties on petroleum exports, which are the main source of the
Venezuelan government's revenues, have fallen dramatically in recent years
as exports have declined.
At the same time, the Venezuelan Congress has failed to approve two
long-standing administration proposals for new taxes (a value added tax and
a tax on assets).
Congress convened special sessions early this year to consider the tax bills
and other issues. The special sessions ended and the ordinary term has
begun, but the bills still have not been approved.
Congressmen and senators - facing elections in December - appear to be
worried that their already low levels of popularity would be worsened by the
imposition of new taxes.
The Perez administration is also hoping it can raise extra revenues this
year from its privatisation programme, which was stalled last year by two
attempted coups and months of political turmoil.
The government raised over Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) with 19
privatisations from 1990 to 1992. This year alone it hopes to raise a
further Dollars 2bn from the sale of some important assets, including
electric power companies and an airline.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate yesterday narrowly backed President Bill Clinton's proposal to
subject a greater proportion of Social Security benefits to income tax,
defeating a Republican amendment to strip this measure out of the budget
package.
The White House had no doubt the vote would be close, so Vice-President Al
Gore, who by virtue of his office presides over the Senate, hurried to
Capitol Hill in case his tie-breaking vote was needed.
In the event, Mr Gore's presence was not required, as Democrats mustered 52
of their 57 Senate members to back President Clinton. Four Democrats voted
with the Republicans, including Senator Bob Krueger of Texas, who faces a
by-election in six weeks to try to keep the seat he has filled since Mr
Lloyd Bentsen became treasury secretary.
Senator George Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, defended the
measure as a necessary component of the Clinton economic package.
'Our colleagues are now making an effort to derail President Clinton's
momentum,' he said. But Republicans claimed the measure was an unfair tax
increase on middle and low income social security recipients.
Retired people now pay income tax on 50 per cent of Social Security benefits
should income exceed Dollars 25,000 (Pounds 17,600) for a single person or
Dollars 32,000 for a married couple. The new proposal would raise the
taxable portion to 85 per cent.
US politicians have learnt from bitter experience not to tangle with the
elderly, because they vote in far greater numbers than any other age group.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Peru lays out welcome mat: Government aims to lure wave of
investors across Pacific - Sally Bowen on plans to attract immigrants with
money to spend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU want a new nationality, have money to invest and can put up a
non-refundable cash contribution of Dollars 25,000 (Pounds 17,605), you
could soon become a Peruvian.
Last week, Peru waived the two-year waiting period for foreigners wishing to
apply for naturalisation. The aim, according to President Alberto Fujimori
and Mr Joy Way, a former industry minister, is to encourage immigration by
Asian businessmen, especially from Hong Kong.
The government hopes a new wave of immigrants will bring technology,
expertise and cash. Mr Fujimori is predicting a 'first wave' of 10,000
immigrants, which would swell state coffers with Dollars 250m to aid
emergency social programmes. 'This is not a migration policy but an
investment policy,' he said at the weekend.
The drive for foreign investment gained fresh impetus last week when the
International Monetary Fund gave the government a long-awaited stamp of
approval for its economic reform programme.
Mr Fujimori plans to start travelling abroad again 'to do business'.
Peruvian and Japanese businessmen have already arranged visits aimed at
attracting investment to Peru.
Net direct foreign investment over the past 15 years has totalled only
Dollars 700m. Recent investment commitments - by Anglo American in the
Quellaveco copper deposits, by the Chinese Shougang Corporation in iron
producer Hierro Peru, and by Petrotech in the ex-Belco drilling operation
off Peru's northern coast - will, if fulfilled, more than double that figure
in the next few years.
The country's fledgling privatisation programme is to be stepped up sharply
with sales worth some Dollars 1.4bn scheduled for this year alone. Mr Daniel
Hokama, mines and energy minister and head of the privatisation office, is
repeating his predecessor's promise to 'sell everything the state owns by
1995 - at the price determined by the market'.
The main items for privatisation this year are the state mining and mineral
companies Centromin, Mineroperu and Tintaya, the telecommunications sector,
a slice of the nation's electricity industry, fish-meal and fish-oil company
Tesca Peru, two state controlled banks, and part of oil giant Petroperu. All
are among Peru's top dozen companies, in turnover if not profit terms.
Foreign consultants and investment banks, notably Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Morgan
Grenfell and Chase Manhattan, are advising on disposal of state assets.
Privately, some express reservations about the speed with which
privatisation is being pushed ahead. Country risk remains a consideration
and investment banks predict difficulties in finding four or five rival
bidders, even for sectors with as much growth potential as
telecommunications.
Increasingly, foreign investment is seen as the panacea for Peru's
continuing domestic economic ills. Recession stubbornly persists, with
industry working at only 45 per cent capacity and gross domestic product
still contracting after last year's 2.7 per cent fall. The sol remains
heavily overvalued, making exports unprofitable and imports cheap.
Industry has been further squeezed in the drive to raise tax revenue. The
manufacturers' society SNI claims industry currently contributes 59 per cent
of all fiscal income.
The society's recipe for economic revival includes a cut in value added tax
from 16 to 5 per cent as the tax base is widened; a hefty cut in taxes paid
by industry for basic services such as electricity, communications and fuel;
implementation of a tax incentive scheme for exporters; and a sharp
reduction in borrowing costs for business which are around 18-20 per cent.
It also favours drastic measures to halt large-scale smuggling.
Industrialists estimate Peru is being flooded with illegally imported goods
worth Dollars 1bn a year, a third of the value of legal imports.
Austere fiscal management and a two-year squeeze on liquidity, meanwhile,
has failed to eliminate inflation. Monthly price rises are still running at
around 4 per cent.
Mr Jorge Camet, the new economy minister, is promising 'at least' 3.5 per
cent growth this year and gradual progress in reducing inflation, devaluing
the sol and cutting interest rates.
Opinion polls show popular approval of the economic programme at its lowest
level (27 per cent) since August 1990's 'shock' price adjustments.
Economists remain suspicious that, without the uncompromising (and recently
sacked) Mr Carlos Bolona at the fiscal and monetary helm, Mr Fujimori may
veer from economic discipline towards economic populism.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Bank chief damps Labor's upbeat mood: Australia's newly
elected leaders are urged to cut budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS than two weeks after its surprise victory in Australia's federal
election, the Labor party's celebrations have been unceremoniously
interrupted by Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank.
Mr Fraser obliged the government on Tuesday by cutting official interest
rates by 0.5 percentage points to 5.25 per cent, effectively redeeming one
of Labor's election promises.
The governor said easier monetary conditions would help to accelerate
Australia's sluggish recovery from the 1990-91 recession, which has so far
been too weak to reduce unemployment from near record levels.
But he also warned that a sustained increase in business investment, a
prerequisite for long-term economic growth, would not take place un-less
there is a substantial reduction in the federal budget deficit.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, brushed off a similar warning during
the election campaign, claiming that it was aimed at the conservative
opposition's plans to introduce a goods and services tax (GST).
Mr Keating argues that the budget slipped into deficit in 1991-92 because of
the cyclical effects of the recession, and claims that faster economic
growth will virtually balance the government's books by 1996-97.
But Mr Fraser's warning adds weight to claims by many economists that the
bulk of the deterioration reflects structural changes in the composition of
the budget which will not be eliminated by recovery.
Mr Bill Shields, chief economist at Macquarie Bank, says that even before
in-cluding election promises worth ADollars 2bn (Pounds 980m), the federal
budget deficit is likely to rise from ADollars 15.9bn this year to ADollars
16.3bn in 1993-94, equivalent to 3.6 per cent of gross domestic product.
Worse still, he forecasts that the net public sector borrowing requirement,
which includes state budgets, will rise to nearly 6 per cent of GDP next
year, excluding asset sales. This compares with net repayments of nearly 2
per cent of GDP in 1988-89.
The danger is that this increased call on savings will impede private sector
investment by pushing up real long-term interest rates. But balancing the
budget will not be easy.
Paradoxically, the government's success in reducing inflation to 0.3 per
cent will reduce growth in revenue by limiting the impact of partial tax
indexation, or 'fiscal drag.'
In addition, Labor's pre-election manoeuvring included legislation
guaranteeing ADollars 8bn in personal tax cuts in the two years to 1996.
The opposition parties, which control the Senate, are unlikely to allow Mr
Keating to withdraw the reductions, even if he thought it politically
sensible.
In its pre-election economic statement, the government forecast that
accelerating growth would reduce the federal budget deficit to about 1 per
cent of GDP by 1996-97, which would stabilise federal government debt at
about 21.6 per cent of GDP.
Macquarie Bank's analysis suggests that such an outcome could be achieved
only by substantial cuts in government spending - ADollars 4.4bn over four
years if real growth averages 4.25 per cent, or ADollars 10.5bn on the more
realistic assumption of 3 per cent average growth.
But the real fiscal position may be even worse.
Mr Geoffrey Lehmann, a partner in Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm,
calculates that Labor's policy announcements since the last budget,
including uncosted election promises, will reduce revenue by a net ADollars
11bn net over the next four years.
If this view is correct, the government will be forced to abandon hopes that
revenue growth will correct the deficit, and will have to make hard choices
about spending cuts in the next budget, due in August.
Like many economists, Mr Lehmann thinks Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, will
be forced to raise taxes to bridge the gap, probably by widening Australia's
relatively narrow indirect tax net, which is equivalent to about 8.5 per
cent of GDP, compared with the OECD average of 11.8 per cent.
The neatest solution would be to introduce a GST, which would work in the
same way as Europe's value added tax. However, the government's vehement
campaign rhetoric has closed off this option for the foreseeable future.
The most likely alternative is a substantial increase in the existing sales
tax, which was streamlined by the govern-ment last year, possibly with
future revenue-raising needs in mind.
Handled carefully, a substantial increase in revenue could be achieved in
conjunction with a rebate system to remove existing taxes on business
inputs.
Ironically, such a tax would look very like a GST.

FT  25 MAR 93 / How Xinhua is pulling HK to China: The news agency is
midwife of the colony's return to the motherland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY next month Mr Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua news agency in Hong
Kong, will take a group of about 50 personalities from the colony to Beijing
to receive their letters of appointment as 'advisers' to China on Hong Kong
affairs.
A year ago Mr Zhou presented the leadership with a glittering array of Hong
Kong's leading plutocrats, including Mr Li Ka-shing, Mr Henry Fok, Sir Run
Sun Shaw - three of the colony's richest men - and a smattering of former
civil servants, judges and serving politicians.
This April will be no different, except in one respect. Mr Zhou's latest
trophy will be Sir David Akers-Jones, a former chief secretary of the
colony, and a British civil servant of the old school. He resigned earlier
this week from chairmanship of Hong Kong's Housing Authority - a position
from which he has been an opponent of Governor Chris Patten's plans for more
democracy in Hong Kong.
What Sir David's and the other 50-or-so appointments to Beijing's court will
underline is the gravitational pull of China and the corresponding waning of
British power in Hong Kong. From Beijing's angle, Xinhua deserves much
credit for hastening that process.
In Hong Kong Xinhua is the face of the Chinese central government - a regime
that rarely does anything unintentionally - in belligerent mode. In the
run-up to 1997 it is the midwife to Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
Its headquarters, faced in red granite, opposite the Happy Valley race
course on Hong Kong Island, houses some 650 mainland officials. Journalists
working for the news agency occupy the first six floors of its former HQ in
Wanchai.
Xinhua's role has changed with the demands of the time. During the Cultural
Revolution it agitated against British rule in Hong Kong until Zhou Enlai,
China's then prime minister, called a halt.
During the 1970s, when China was still a diplomatic outcast, Xinhua's
'foreign affairs' department met diplomatic representatives of countries
with which China had no formal ties. More recently, diplomats say, it has
been the conduit for unofficial talks with South Africa and was China's
channel for setting up diplomatic ties with Israel last year.
The agency's work in Hong Kong is, however, the standard by which it is
judged in Beijing. Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister, ought to be pleased
with Mr Zhou's performance since he took over Xinhua in early 1990 from Mr
Xu Jiatun - the highest ranking Chinese communist official to defect to the
west.
Mr Xu lacked revolutionary fervour in his later years and was an ideological
casualty of Beijing's Tiananmen massacre in June 1989. Not so Mr Zhou. He is
a man whose loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party is such that in spite of
being a vigorous Cultural Revolutionary, for which he won few friends, he
has gone from strength to strength in the era of Deng Xiaoping and 'opening
to the outside world'.
If 'hardline', 'moderate' and 'liberal' have any meaning in Chinese
politics, then Mr Zhou is assuredly a hardliner. He has, according to
western analysts and Xinhua employees, toughened up the organisation and
overseen its 'united front' activities in the colony to great effect.
The agency draws its senior officials from the upper echelons of the party.
Mr Zhou, who holds ministerial rank in the Chinese government, is a career
diplomat who has served in Pakistan and Tanzania, and at the United Nations.
He was a member of the Chinese team which negotiated the Sino-British Joint
Declaration of 1984 and, last October, was appointed to the central
committee of the Communist party.
Fluent in English and fond of quoting Shakespeare, Mr Zhou is passionately
anti-British. Some analysts attribute this to his early diplomatic
experience of former British colonies; others to his first job.
During the Korean War he interpreted for Chinese interrogators of Allied
prisoners of war.
'POWs are often scared and they collaborate; their interrogators feel
contempt for them,' said one observer.
But Mr Zhou's claim to fame may be the accolade he received from Mr Deng
after the Joint Declaration was agreed in 1984. UK officials saw him as one
who tried to wreck those talks, but Mr Deng is reported to have said he did
a good job, a commendation that has shielded Mr Zhou ever since, but one
which may only be good for the term of Mr Deng's life.
Other senior officials of the agency have held senior provincial government
positions. Mr Qin Wenjun, the agency's No 2 deputy director, was the
vice-major of Shenzhen, the 'special economic zone' to the north of Hong
Kong.
His responsibilities include 'co-ordination', or building a broad coalition
of 'capitalist and bourgeois forces' in opposition to the British.
He reports directly to the party's United Front department in Beijing.
Xinhua has opted for the more neutral term 'co-ordination' so as not to
offend the locals, one employee said.
Mr Zhang Guoxiong, the agency's first deputy director, was formerly head of
the Guangdong communist party's personnel department. He covers personnel
issues and 'social work', Xinhua's liaison with trade unions. He is one of
the few senior Xinhua officials who speak Cantonese, the dialect of Hong
Kong and neighbouring Guangdong.
The agency puts little trust in its locally recruited staff, a mirror of the
Communist party's broader distrust of Hong Kong.
Many of its local employees, who believed in the Joint Declaration's promise
of 'Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong' with a 'high degree of autonomy', are
dejected about the current turn of events. 'In theory, what China wants is a
smooth transition,' says one. 'But in essence they want to control HK from
behind the scenes. They are only interested in those who will follow what
they say.'

FT  25 MAR 93 / Weizman elected Israeli president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR EZER WEIZMAN, one of Israel's most colourful and controversial
politicians, was yesterday elected as the country's seventh president.
A supporter of direct contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation
and a man who finds his opinions difficult to contain, Mr Weizman can be
expected to push to the limits the remit of his mainly ceremonial post.
'I think I know what I am forbidden to do, but I am not yet clear what I am
allowed to do,' he said after winning the vote by members of the Knesset
(parliament).
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, was quick to enlighten him.
He said Mr Weizman well understood presidential responsibility, which was to
unite the people, help the government and advance its goals without being
political.
Israel's new president is one of the country's few politicians who have
moved from right to left across the political spectrum.
The architect of Israel's air victory in the 1967 six-day war, he guided the
Likud party to its shock electoral triumph in the 1977 general election and
was the only politician in Israel to strike up a personal relationship with
President Anwar Sadat after the Egyptian leader's visit to Jerusalem later
that year.
Mr Weizman, who learned to fly with the Royal Air Force during the second
world war, joins fellow-pilots Assad of Syria, Mubarak of Egypt and Hussein
of Jordan at the centre of Middle East peace efforts.
Mr Shevach Weiss, speaker of the Knesset, saw it as an omen that the peace
process was about to take off.
How far it might fly will be more emphatically affected by another Israeli
election yesterday where four candidates are fighting for leadership of the
Likud party. Likud is historically committed to the idea of a greater Israel
which includes the Arab occupied territories.
With the result due to be announced today, the likely victor is Mr Binjamin
'Bibi' Netanyahu. He is seen by his supporters as the modern, televisual
riposte to the ageing generation of politicians represented by Mr Weizman
and Mr Rabin, but by his detractors as shallow, superficial and
self-centred. If no candidate wins 40 per cent of the votes cast by an
estimated 200,000 Likud members, a second round will be necessary.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Keating reshuffle a 'generational change'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL KEATING, the Australian prime minister, yesterday promoted six
backbenchers to the cabinet in a reshuffle designed to keep the Labor party
in government for the rest of the decade.
Mr Keating also moved several senior public servants and restructured a
number of departments in an attempt to distance the government from the
nine-year administration of Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister.
He said the reshuffle represented a 'generational change' which would renew
Labor's capacity to govern and prepare the party for the next election, due
by mid-1996.
In an unexpected move, Mr Keating took personal responsibility for
Aboriginal affairs at cabinet level, one of several non-economic portfolios
he has identified as priorities following Labor's election victory last
week.
The decision suggests that the government plans to accelerate attempts to
achieve reconciliation with Aborigines and to negotiate a compromise on
controversial land rights claims.
The other big surprise was the appointment of Senator Peter Cook, the former
industrial relations minister, as trade minister within the cabinet. Mr John
Kerin, the sacked former trade minister, was not a member of the cabinet.
Senator Gareth Evans remains foreign minister, with the added post of
government leader in the Senate.
The economic ministries are unchanged. Mr John Dawkins stays on as treasurer
and Mr Ralph Willis remains as finance minister.
In other moves, Mr Keating doubled cabinet representation of the health and
housing department, and created separate ministries for Pacific Island
affairs, schools and training, and regional affairs (within Australia). He
also streamlined the cabinet committee system, drawing criticism from
environmental groups angry about the abolition of the sustainable
development committee, which co-ordinated big development projects.
In the public service, Mr Ted Evans, Australia's chief representative at the
International Monetary Fund, becomes head of the Treasury, replacing Mr Tony
Cole, who is thought to have clashed with Mr Dawkins.
Mr Cole and four other department heads will move to other departments or to
overseas posts.
The most senior of the new members of the cabinet is Senator Graham
Richardson, a long-serving former minister who resigned last year after
allegations about his relationship with a businessman facing fraud charges.
The other new cabinet members are Mr Alan Griffiths, industry; Senator Bob
McMullan, arts; Mr Laurie Brereton, industrial relations; Mr Michael Lee,
tourism and resources; Mr Peter Baldwin, social security; Mr Duncan Kerr,
justice; and Mr Michael Lavarch, attorney-general.
Mr Baldwin and Mr Griffiths were formerly junior ministers.

Large numbers of ethnic Vietnamese are fleeing their homes in Cambodia
following a massacre blamed on Khmer Rouge guerrillas, the United Nations
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh.
UN naval peacekeeping patrols have reported movements of Vietnamese on the
Tonle Sap, a lake in the centre of the country, a spokesman for the UN
Transitional Authority in Cambodia told a news briefing.
About 100 boats were seen travelling down the Tonle Sap River - a tributary
of the Mekong that flows from the lake - towards and past Phnom Penh, the
national capital, at the weekend.
The exodus follows the killing of at least 38 people during an attack on a
Vietnamese village on the Tonle Sap on March 10.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH KOREA said yesterday that it was ending its state of 'semi-war' that
was declared two weeks ago in response to the annual US-South Korean
military exercise, writes John Burton in Seoul.
The Team Spirit manoeuvres, which Pyongyang claimed were a 'rehearsal for
nuclear war', were completed last Thursday, and US troops who participated
in the exercise are leaving South Korea.
The proclamation of a 'semi-war' footing was a prelude to Pyongyang's
subsequent withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
North Korea said it was pulling out of the treaty due to the Team Spirit
exercise and a demand by the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect
two facilities believed to be connected with the country's nuclear weapons
programme.
Officials in Seoul said Pyongyang put the country on a 'semi-war' footing to
build support for North Korea's next leader, Mr Kim Jong-il, who is
gradually assuming power from his father, Mr Kim Il-sung.
Mr Kim Jong-il is believed to face army opposition and the semi-war status
was meant to assert his authority over the military establishment.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN creditor governments warned Nigeria yesterday that new loans might
dry up if it failed to reduce its Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.23bn
to Pounds 3bn) arrears on official debt repayments.
The warning was issued to Mr Oladele Olashore, the Nigerian finance
minister, who was summoned to appear for two hours before the Paris Club of
official creditors to explain why the country had fallen so far behind on
payments so soon after its last agreement lapsed a year ago.
'The Nigerians were told that it will be difficult to get new money unless
they regularise their payments,' said an official. Several creditors feel
that they are in a difficult situation, he said. It is very rare for finance
ministers to be asked to the Paris Club's regular monthly working level
meetings, a mark of lenders' concern over Nigeria's case.
Mr Olashore was told that Nigeria will get the debt relief it so badly needs
only if it gets an IMF agreement. He told sceptical creditors that Nigeria
hoped to get such an agreement before the general election, due to bring a
civilian president to powerin August.
Nigeria is struggling with a worsening balance of payments crisis and
pressure on its currency, which have together eaten away at much of its
foreign reserves, now the equivalent of less than eight weeks' import cover.
By the end of last year, it had Dollars 27.6bn foreign debt, of which
Dollars 16.5bn was owed to the Paris Club.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT FW de Klerk told a joint sitting of South Africa's parliament in
Cape Town yesterday that he would mobilise military reservists in a
crackdown on what he called 'barbaric' political violence.
Mr de Klerk has recently been facing a public outcry over attacks on whites
by blacks, in which several people, including schoolchildren, have been
killed. His ministers have raised the fear that such attacks could spark
revenge violence, and spiralling inter-racial conflict.
Mr de Klerk said a solution to political violence should top the agenda at
multi-party democracy talks due to begin again next week. Parliament would
be asked to vote on suspending the moratorium on the death penalty adopted
three years ago.
He favoured the death penalty for certain extreme crimes, but MPs would be
allowed to vote according to their conscience.
Recalling the slaughter of six black schoolchildren near Pietermaritzburg
earlier this month and last Friday's killing of a mother and two children
near Johannesburg, he said: 'This is barbaric and totally unacceptable in a
civilised society.' Reservists would be mobilised to boost security forces
manpower in an unspecified 'action plan' to stabilise troubled areas.
Mr de Klerk called on the radical Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) to distance
itself from guerrilla attacks by its military wing, the Azanian People's
Liberation Army (APLA), and said police had arrested 18 APLA members. More
arrests would follow.
The government would hold the PAC responsible for APLA's actions, he said,
but refrained from repeating an earlier government insistence that the PAC
repudiate APLA as a condition of its participation in next week's talks.
Black gunmen have killed 10 whites since December in attacks on commuters, a
club, a restaurant and a farm.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE retailers reported a 5.4 per cent fall in sales last month,
compared with a year earlier, putting added pressure on the government to
stimulate consumer spending with an income tax cut in coming months.
The Japan Chain Store Association said sales had fallen against year-earlier
levels for six consecutive months, as consumers, intimidated by the economic
downturn, have increased their savings and reduced their spending.
Car and commercial vehicle production was down 1.2 per cent to 1.043m units
in February, the fifth consecutive month of decline, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers' Association said.
Passenger car output, excluding mini-cars, increased 1.1 per cent, but truck
production was down 8 per cent, the 19th month of year-on-year decline and a
sign of weak capital spending by Japanese companies.
The downturn in consumer confidence has prompted the ruling Liberal
Democratic party to consider ways of rekindling demand, apart from an
increase in infrastructure investment, as part of a stimulatory package
expected to be decided next month.
Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the LDP's policy research council, wants
an initial draft of the package completed on April 5 for presentation to
opposition parties, and says the amount will exceed the Y10,700bn (Pounds
62,573m) emergency package announced last August.
The LDP is also expected to meet opposition parties on April 7 to decide on
whether an income tax cut will be necessary to ensure recovery.
Ministry of finance officials are arguing against a reduction, in the belief
that a second package alone will be sufficient to achieve a revival in the
economy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Japan are deadlocked over the issue of setting new market share
targets for semiconductor trade. Tokyo is refusing to agree to the use of
any quantitative measure for foreign access to its Dollars 20bn market.
Trade officials from both countries meeting in Hawaii ended their talks on
Tuesday without resolving the dispute. The US has been pressing for a new
market share target of a 20 per cent average this year.
The semiconductor dispute has taken on a broader significance in the light
of comments by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, that he may take a
similar approach, setting 'temporary quantitative indicators' in other
sectors where the US believes the Japanese market is not open to its
companies.
US trade officials returned to Washington yesterday and the semiconductor
issue will now be taken up at a senior administration level, in advance of a
visit next month by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's premier.
The US could seek an amendment to the 1991 bilateral semiconductor trade
pact, including new market share targets. Alternatively, an informal
agreement could be sought with the Japanese. Most likely, however,
Washington will take a unilateral position, declaring its new market share
target and using it as the primary measure of Japan's compliance with its
promise to ensure greater market access for foreign microchip suppliers.
Japan is determined to avoid any use of market share targets in future trade
pacts, and is taking a stand on the issue in the semiconductor talks.
Last week, the US and Japan announced that a 20 per cent foreign share of
the Japanese semiconductor market had been achieved in the fourth quarter of
1992. Achievement of that target, set in the 1991 pact, has been hailed by
the US as evidence that market share targets are an effective means of
prying open Japanese markets. Japan maintains, however, that the
semiconductor agreement has been misinterpreted all along by the US, and
that no formal commitment to 20 per cent was ever made.
The semiconductor trade dispute, which has fuelled trade tensions between
the US and Japan for the past decade, now appears set to become a central
issue in the Clinton administration's efforts to reduce Japan's Dollars 50bn
trade surplus with the US.

JAPAN hit back yesterday against strong criticism of its trading practices
by President Bill Clinton.
The US leader's statement on Tuesday that the prospect of gaining fair
access to the Japanese market was 'somewhat remote' was based on a
misunderstanding of that market, said Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister
for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
'Japan was the largest market for US agricultural products and the second
largest for US manufactured goods. If Japanese markets were really difficult
to access, this could not be the case,' he said.
Japan's imports from the US had increased in value from Dollars 48.2bn in
1989 to Dollars 52.1bn last year. It was not appropriate to compare Japan's
trade surplus with others. Japan was more competitive, he said.
The minister repeated Tokyo's rejection it should set market share targets
as a measurement of access. 'We are working in a free market which cannot be
changed by artificial means,' he said.
Japan believed the US-Japan trade balance should be improved through efforts
to cut the US budget deficit and raise US competitiveness.

PORTUGAL yesterday announced an Es300bn (Pounds 1.4bn) package designed to
support exports and help industry through the international recession, Peter
Wise reports. The aim is to help exporters penetrate non-traditional
markets, to promote Portuguese products in specific markets and to support
companies hit by exchange-rate instability and the crisis in the former
Soviet Union.

FT  25 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japanese bid-rigging helps US case -
Robert Thomson reports on political interference in public works contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Japanese prosecutors unearthed evidence that construction companies
ranked politicians according to influence, beginning with A+ for the very
powerful and down to D for those hardly worth cultivating, they probably
helped the cause of foreign contractors in the Japanese market.
The investigation into political corruption has confirmed foreign
allegations of bid-rigging and political interference in awarding public
works contracts. It has also prompted debate about reform of both the
building industry and the political system.
In the past few days, 17 of the country's largest contractors have been
raided by prosecutors searching for evidence in a tax evasion case against
Mr Shin Kanemaru, the fallen godfather of the governing Liberal Democratic
party. But their success in highlighting collusion in the industry will
force the Fair Trade Commission, the anti-monopoly body, to take tougher
action.
For the US government, the prosecutors have furnished much useful
information about the 'synergy' between politicians and contractors, with
the former providing the latter with contracts, and the latter donating to
the former a small percentage of a contract's value.
The US has negotiated with Japan for the past decade in the hope of making
the contract process more transparent, and had suspected that politicians
were a 'structural impediment' to a free market. But raising the suspicions
during formal negotiations was impossible without causing offence.
Now, damning material gathered by prosecutors is leaked each day to the
Japanese press, and the difficulties faced by foreign contractors have been
put in a new context. Prosecutors say that politicians simply rang the
appropriate government authority to ensure that contracts were awarded to a
company which was close to the LDP.
President Bill Clinton will be briefed on construction market access, and he
is expected to raise the issue during a meeting next month in Washington
with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister. The two sides are yet to settle
a dispute over technical standards, and the US wants additions to the list
of 34 projects for which bidding procedures have been simplified for foreign
companies.
In response to the emerging scandal, Mr Miyazawa told parliament yesterday
that the 'time has come for the government to be more open in awarding
public works contracts', and that bureaucrats will be instructed to tighten
controls over decision-making.
Mr Miyazawa's statement came after a former Construction Ministry official
confessed that he was responsible for deciding on a contract during the
1980s, and received a phone call from a senior politician who said Company A
should win because 'it has studied the project carefully'.
Company A did win, the official said, because of the politician's call, but
the public reason for its selection was given as 'technical know-how'. While
not all contracts are awarded unfairly, unsuccessful foreign bidders are
often said to lack 'technical know-how'.
The Ministry of Construction, which has represented Japan at the
negotiations with the US, lamented the damage done to the image of the
construction industry: 'We have really been making an effort to ensure
transparency and fair competition, and we have tried to meet international
standards.'
Some curious details about the contract process have emerged in Mr
Kanemaru's home prefecture of Yamanashi, where an association of local
contractors referred to Y1m (Pounds 5,800) kickbacks as manju, a very sweet
Japanese cake, while a 'coffee charge' of Y20,000 or Y30,000 was paid by
bidders on decision day.
Mr Kanemaru is still thought of fondly in his home prefecture, where a
recently-build bridge is known as 'Shin's bridge' and a highway has been
dubbed 'Shin's way'. But there is widespread anger in Japan that a
percentage of the cost of public works contracts was a donation to the LDP.
Apart from skewering politicians, the prosecutors have shown that dango or
cartels routinely decide which company will win a contract and the price. US
negotiators argue dango deny foreign contractors a fair chance, but Japanese
companies still say the system gives small companies a decent share of
public contracts.
A manager at a large contractor raided this week said that 'Americans don't
really understand our system', which is based on the principle of 'mutual
benefit'.

JAPAN hit back yesterday against strong criticism of its trading practices
by President Bill Clinton.
The US leader's statement on Tuesday that the prospect of gaining fair
access to the Japanese market was 'somewhat remote' was based on a
misunderstanding of that market, said Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister
for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
'His understanding of the Japanese market is wrong,' Mr Hatakeyama told the
FT. Japan was the largest market for US agricultural products and the second
largest for US manufactured goods. If Japanese markets were really difficult
to access, this could not be the case.
President Clinton's statement that the trade imbalance with Japan was the
only one that did not seem to change very much was also untrue, said Mr
Hatakeyama. Japan's imports from the US had increased in value from Dollars
48.2bn in 1989 to Dollars 52.1bn last year.
It was not appropriate to compare Japan's trade surplus with the situation
in other countries since there was a difference in competitiveness, Mr
Hatakeyama said. Japan was more competitive than other US trading partners.
The minister repeated the Japanese government's rejection of the US
suggestion that it should set market share targets as a measurement of
access. 'We are working in a free market which cannot be changed by
artificial means,' he said. The US-Japan trade balance should be improved
through efforts to reduce the US budget deficit and raise US
competitiveness, in the government's view.
Mr Hatakeyama welcomed President Clinton's decision not to act unilaterally
by raising US tariffs on minivans from 2.5 per cent to 25 per cent but to
address the issue 'in the context of of a larger set of trade issues'.
Raising the tariff would have been a breach of Gatt rules.
Further Japanese steps to open its markets and expand domestic demand were
promised yesterday by Mr Yohei Kono, chief cabinet secretary. The issue
would be addressed by Mr Yoshiro Mori, trade minister, during his visit to
Washington later this week, he said.
Mr Kono pointed out, however, that the surplus has grown even though the
volume of imports into Japan had not fallen. This was in part due to the
rise in the value of the yen.

FT  25 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Italy tries to curb shoe imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY is seeking to restrict imports of shoes, ceramics and silks from
non-EC countries entering via Britain, Germany and the Netherlands. A letter
to this effect has been sent by Mr Claudio Vitalone, the Italian trade
minister, to Sir Leon Brittan, the EC Commissioner in charge of trade
policy.
Sir Leon has already raised the issue threatening action against these three
countries and the matter was discussed inconclusively in the March 8 Council
of Ministers, according to the Italian trade ministry.
Italy is alarmed that some Italian companies are taking advantage of
liberalisation in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands following the January
inauguration of the single market by importing direct from these countries
goods from non-EC members.
The main area of concern centres on imports of shoes, ceramics and silks -
all items which domestic industry is extremely sensitive about  - from
China, North Korea and Vietnam.
The Italian move appears designed to put pressure on ministers of the
Community to resolve the issue of third-country imports.
In the meantime, Italy has given notice that it reserves the right to
protect itself under Article 115 of the Treaty of Rome.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Bosnia peace plan suffers new setbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bosnian peace process suffered serious reversals last night. Mediators
told the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, that because of his
intransigence he might as well go home, and Nato's top military official
said the peace plan would be impossible to enforce in its present form.
At a press conference in New York, Mr Karadzic announced he would leave last
night but was willing to return if so requested by the mediators, Mr Cyrus
Vance and Lord Owen.
He attempted to shift blame for the breakdown to the Bosnian president, Mr
Alija Izetbegovic, who has refused to meet him face to face.
Mr Vance, who is indisposed by an attack of bronchitis, and Lord Owen, both
refrained from declaring the talks formally at an end. But their spokesman,
Mr Fred Eckhard, relayed their feelings of frustration and deep pessimism.
While Mr Izetbegovic continued to seek 'clarifications' of the peace plan,
having indicated earlier he might sign the map of the 10 semi-autonomous
provinces into which Bosnia would be divided, there was no prospect that Mr
Karadzic would 'come round any time soon', Mr Eckhard told reporters.
At the same time, Field Marshal Richard Vincent, chairman of Nato's military
committee, told alliance ambassadors at a meeting in Brussels that
conditions in Bosnia and lack of clarity in the plan meant it could not be
enforced.
'He said the conditions in Bosnia are now so bad that Vance-Owen could not
be implemented in its present form, from a military viewpoint,' a Nato
diplomat said.
Meanwhile, the US, Britain and France were reported to have abandoned for
the time being a proposal before the UN Security Council to authorise the
shooting down of aircraft violating the Bosnian no-fly zone.
They were said to have acted in response to Russian objections, which
earlier appeared to have been overcome by fixing a 14-day grace period for
the resolution going into effect.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, accused Serb forces of
shelling a UN helicopter pad at Srebrenica when personnel were trying to
evacuate wounded civilians.
The evacuation was suspended after the shelling killed at least three people
and injured six, including two Canadian soldiers.
Under a deal worked out by French UN commander Gen Philippe Morillon, Serb
leaders had authorised the airlift of Moslem sick and wounded from
Srebrenica on condition that 44 Serbs were evacuated from Tuzla, a
Moslem-held town in northern Bosnia. That evacuation was completed last
night.
In another development, the German coalition government agreed to ask the
constitutional court to settle a dispute over whether German air crews can
stay on board Nato Awacs reconnaissance aircraft over the Adriatic.
The Free Democrats, the junior coalition party, insist that if the UN
decides to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia, the Awacs' role will become
combat-related and the German crews must be withdrawn.

FT  25 MAR 93 / EC clears Berlin deal with Sony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has decided that the Berlin city authorities did not
'sweeten' unduly a 1991 property deal with Sony, to persuade the Japanese
electronics manufacturer to move its European headquarters to a prime city
site.
The Commission yesterday closed its 15-month inquiry into the DM101m (Pounds
42.7m) deal, by deciding that the Japanese company would not have to pay
extra for the site on Potsdamer Platz, which used to be bisected by the
Berlin Wall.
Brussels has been looking closely at property deals in Berlin, where prices
have increased substantially since unification of the city. Companies which
are found to have paid less than market value for state-owned properties can
be asked to 'repay' what amounts to an illegal state subsidy. Last April,
the Commission ordered Daimler-Benz to make an additional DM33.8m payment to
the Berlin authorities, on top of the DM93m which it paid in July 1990 for
another office site on the Potsdamer Platz.
The Commission applied the same reasoning to the Sony sale. Following an
independent valuation, Brussels estimated that the 30,900 sq m Sony site was
worth between DM128m and DM149.5m. However, it agreed that figure should be
adjusted downwards by about DM41.3m to take account of strict conditions
imposed by the Berlin authorities. After adjustment, the Commission
estimated that the potential state subsidy in the deal was too small to be
significant.
Daimler-Benz has never pursued its objections to the Commission's decision
on its property deal, and is also believed to be happy with the ruling
favouring Sony.

ANOTHER senior member of the Fiat group has been caught up in the corruption
investigations of Milan magistrates.
Yesterday the magistrates revealed that two days ago a cautionary warrant
alleging corruption had been issued against Mr Riccardo Ruggeri, the chief
executive of New Holland, the agricultural machinery and earth moving
venture owned 80 per cent by Fiat and 20 per cent by Ford.
Mr Ruggeri, based at New Holland's headquarters in London, is understood to
have been named by Mr Luigi Caprotti, a former concessionary in Lombardy of
Iveco, Fiat's commercial vehicles group, who had already been questioned by
Milan magistrates. Mr Ruggeri was formerly managing director of Iveco.
Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, and Mr Antonio
Mosconi, head of Toro, the Turin group's insurance arm, are being held in a
Milan jail.

FT  25 MAR 93 / French refuse to slam door on Le Pen: The centre-right's
landslide has failed to damage the National Front in the south
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE electoral tide that will carry France's centre-right parties to
government next week has rolled down the Rhone valley. But there are two
rocks of resistance which it has not completely washed over, at least not
until the results of Sunday's run-off parliamentary election are in.
The biggest reef which the neo-Gaullist Republican Rally (RPR) and the Union
for French Democracy (UDF) liberals have hit is the National Front. Mr
Raymond Barre, the centrist ex-prime minister, who by a narrow margin was
elected outright in last Sunday's first ballot, said he had never thought to
see the Front do so well.
In fact, the far-right party of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen scored a relatively low
17 per cent in Mr Barre's Lyons constituency. Elsewhere it was more
successful. Five years ago, only one of its candidates reached the second
round in the Rhone department's 14 constituencies; on Sunday it will have
seven candidates in the run-off to contest the 12 seats which remain open.
One of them is Mr Bruno Gollnisch who came top in his constituency with 24.5
per cent of the vote.
Attracting the support that had gone to a dissident Gaullist who was
eliminated in the first round is Mr Gollnisch's main hope of keeping first
place in the run-off - and he is convinced that the Front is now firmly
embedded as the region's second political force.
Married to a Japanese whose language and civilisation he teaches at Lyons
university, Mr Gollnisch does not fit easily the xenophobic image of the
Front, even though he is a member of its national executive.
But he does expound on the threats of immigration and Aids. 'This is why
people listen to us - we were the ones to break the taboos on talking about
these issues,' he says.
Like Mr Le Pen, his leader, Mr Gollnisch has no inhibitions about attacking
the press and pollsters for consistently underestimating his party.
'The polls are run by crooks or idiots who should know by now that people
are more hesitant about professing their support for the Front than for
other parties,' he says.
He believes that pollsters should build a correction factor into their
estimates of support for the Front.
The other point of resistance to the prevailing tide is less a reef than an
outcrop, since it consists of one man - Mr Michel Noir, the embattled mayor
of Lyons. Once a rising star of the RPR in whose last government he served
as trade minister, Mr Noir formed a breakaway reformist movement a couple of
years ago. It went nowhere. Yet the RPR would probably never have dared take
on the mayor of France's second largest city, had they not scented weakness.
The smell was indeed obvious to all, from the moment Mr Noir became
embroiled last year in the 'Botton affair'. Mr Pierre Botton, once a
prominent Lyonnais businessman who is still Mr Noir's son-in-law, is in jail
on charges of milking his companies of money that he put to various uses,
including free holidays for a prominent TV anchorman, but also the illegal
funding of Mr Noir's 1989 mayoral campaign which he managed.
Mr Noir's effort to wipe off the mud were made no easier when earlier this
month Mr Botton leaked to the press copies of a letter Mr Noir had written
in 1989 detailing how he would be repaying the money to Mr Botton.
But somehow Mr Noir seems to have convinced a number of Lyonnais that he is
the innocent victim of a family vendetta. In his attempt to keep his
parliamentary seat (which in France can be combined with that of mayor), Mr
Noir was less than one percentage point in the first ballot behind Mr Alain
Merieux. Mr Merieux is the official RPR candidate and scion of
Rhone-Poulenc's Institut Merieux, which is a world leader in vaccines.
In a Tuesday night radio debate, Mr Noir exploited Mr Merieux's tactless
suggestion that a Noirist Lyons would find itself isolated in an RPR-run
France, by claiming that his city was being victimised as well as himself.
On Sunday Mr Noir will not be able to count on support which in the first
round went to Socialist or green candidates - those parties have told their
voters to stay out of the Noir-Merieux mudfight. But he has one thing going
for him - hatred of the local National Front, which has filed lawsuits
against him for blocking their use of municipal meeting places.
The Front's defeated candidate in the constituency, Ms Anne Richard, has
called on her supporters not to vote for Mr Noir, and said she will vote for
Mr Merieux. The latter is desperately stressing that he has never solicited
her backing, but with friends like the Front he may find himself with too
many enemies to stay top in Sunday's poll.
The outcome will be an important test of how respectable the Le Pen party is
now considered in today's France.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Benefits for Russia will take time: Free trade zone plan
seen by the Twelve as a 'political signal' of support for the reform
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor

<TEXT>
RUSSIA would take longer than did Poland, the Czech and Slovak republic and
Hungary to reap benefits from trade liberalisation with the European
Community, trade specialists said yesterday.
The slow response would largely be due to internal economic disorder, they
said.
New figures about to be released from the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade in Geneva show that the economies of central and eastern Europe have
seen strong export gains to the EC - up about 20 per cent in 1992 after a 12
per cent rise in 1991.
East Europe's imports from the EC grew even faster, however, showing that at
present the economies in transformation are offering better market
opportunities to EC exporters than vice versa.
'Exports especially to the EC grew quite substantially,' a Gatt official
said. 'It is tempting to impute a causal relationship between the
improvement as last year's market opening agreements (with Poland, Hungary
and the Czech and Slovak republic), but no detailed investigation has been
possible.'
This improvement contrasts with an overall fall in exports from central and
eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States of 10 per cent to
Dollars 85bn.
Agreements with the three eastern European economies providing better access
to the EC market went into force in March last year. Quotas were set on food
exports, textile products, steel and chemicals - all sectors where strong
export gains might have been expected. Potential gains have also been reined
in by anti-dumping actions against steel exporters from the region late last
year.
Strongest growth in exports to the EC was seen for the Czech and Slovak
republic, which saw exports leap by 40 per cent, with Bulgaria seeing a 24.5
per cent gain. By contrast, CIS exports stagnated.
In any 'Europe agreement', Russia would probably hope for better openings
for its raw materials, especially oil and gas. It would probably face less
protectionist resistance than the eastern European economies did to many of
their manufactured exports, though controversy over fish, alumina and
non-ferrous metals cannot be ruled out.

THE European Commission yesterday gave Norway the green light for its
application to join the European Community, and accession negotiations are
expected to open formally when EC foreign ministers meet in Luxembourg on
April 5.
Brussels is moving fast to bring talks with Norway into line with entry
negotiations that began on February 1 with Austria, Sweden and Finland,
aiming at membership for all four by 1995 if their governments can gain
public support.
Norway rejected EC membership in a divisive referendum in 1972, and
enthusiasm for joining the Community there and in Sweden and Finland is
currently lukewarm at best.
Mr Hans van den Broek, EC foreign affairs commissioner, who is conducting
the negotiations, stressed yesterday that all the applicants had to accept
both existing EC rules and laws, and the Maastricht treaty, which still
awaits ratification by Norway's Nordic neighbour, Denmark, and the UK.
He restated official EC policy that there is no prospect of granting the new
applicants the opt-outs on monetary union, common defence policy and
European citizenship devised to enable Denmark, whose voters narrowly
rejected Maastricht last June, to re-present the treaty in a second
referendum on May 18.
In common with its co-applicants, Norway will spend the next several months
working through a list of EC laws, testing for compatibility with their own
laws. These, however, have largely been brought into line via the European
Economic Area treaty creating a free trade zone between the EC and the
European Free Trade Association (Efta) to which all the candidate countries
belong.
Trickier issues - such as agriculture, fisheries, competition law, state
aid, regional policy and - especially for Norway - energy, will be dealt
with separately in 29 'packages'.
The hope is to conclude by year-end, enabling referendums in the applicant
countries next year.
Mr Van den Broek adopted a tough line on the negotiations, warning that it
was up to the applicants to accommodate themselves to the Community and sell
the policies to their voters.
Referring to the 1972 referendum in Norway, Mr Van den Broek said that 'the
Community is not for sale'.
'It's not our task to influence the very mature public opinion of Norway one
way or the other,' he said.
But he acknowledged that a Yes to Maastricht in Denmark 'is not without
relevance to this whole exercise'.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Brussels explains trade plan for Moscow: Free trade zone
plan seen by the Twelve as a 'political signal' of support for the reform
programme

THE European Commission confirmed yesterday it is seeking an enlarged
mandate for its 'partnership' negotiations with Russia, and that the aim is
eventually to create a free trade agreement with the former Soviet republic.
The Commission will ask EC foreign ministers to endorse the free trade
mandate on April 5 in Luxembourg. But a delegation of Community foreign
ministers and commissioners is expected to raise the new terms of
negotiation with the embattled government of President Boris Yeltsin in
Moscow this weekend.
The hope is to conclude an agreement with Russia in time for the Copenhagen
summit of EC heads of government on June 21-22.
Following yesterday's Commission meeting, Mr Hans van den Broek, EC external
affairs commissioner, confirmed that the 'eventual' aim of the agreement was
a free trade zone with Russia, 'provided political and economic
circumstances allow it'.
'Any solution to the (Russian) crisis will not, obviously, depend on our
negotiation,' Mr Van den Broek said. 'But the political signal' from the EC,
he added, 'is very clear.'
Senior officials say nobody is under any illusions about the gargantuan task
of reaching a free trade arrangement with the former command economy, when
the fate of Russia's economic reforms, and its future commitment to them,
hang on the outcome of the power struggle in Moscow.
But the Commission said it 'believes that by expressing a willingness to go
beyond traditional trade and co-operation and eventually achieve free trade
with Russia, the Community would be sending an important signal to Moscow
that it fully supports the reform process'.
Mr Yeltsin expressly asked for the negotiations to encompass free trade, to
give Russia the same sort of access to EC markets promised to Hungary,
Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics, Bulgaria and Romania.
The main difference between what the Commission wants for Russia and what
has been negotiated with the east and central Europeans is that the drive
towards a free trade zone with the latter is linked to their eventual
membership of the Community. This is not on offer to Russia - or other
former Soviet republics to which free trade arrangements might also be
extended.
But the terms of trade Russia might get, according to confidential
Commission documents, could theoretically be more favourable than for the
east Europeans, who have been frustrated by EC barriers to their most
competitive produce, like steel, textiles and food. The 'safeguard clause'
the Commission envisages against any flood of competitive Russian goods
spells out that it 'will only be invoked in the event of a serious injury,
or a threat of a serious injury to domestic (EC) producers of like or direct
competitive products'.
The word 'serious' is underlined in the text, and some commissioners
yesterday underlined their concern about its potentially broad sweep.
Officials said they had wanted to defer deciding on the proposal until next
week, to allow further examination of the safeguard clause, and were angered
that aspects of the plan had been reported in yesterday's Financial Times.

FT  25 MAR 93 / EC telecoms groups in talks on liberalisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR executives of EC telecommunications operators meet in Brussels today
to discuss European Commission plans to open domestic and international
telephone calls to full competition by 1998.
Brussels' telecoms directorate has produced a draft plan which would involve
opening cross-border calls within the EC to competition by January 1, 1996.
The same plan would set a target of January 1, 1998 for the controversial
liberalisation of all calls - including those within individual countries
and to countries outside the EC.
Today's meeting with Commission officials will be followed by a similar
round of talks tomorrow involving national telecoms regulators. The meetings
mark the end of six months of consultations with member states, consumers,
regulators and operators.
Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC telecoms commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert,
responsible for competition, will then have to decide whether to submit
far-reaching proposals to their fellow commissioners and ultimately to EC
telecoms ministers, who next meet on May 10. Both commissioners favour more
liberalisation, to improve efficiency and competition, but they will
probably want to safeguard operators' commitment to provide a uniform
service for all consumers.
The main battle among commissioners, and then among member states, is likely
to be over the timing of such a plan. As drafted, it would go too slowly for
some telecoms operators, such as British Telecom, and too fast for others,
including the German state company Deutsche Telekom. Some member states with
less well-developed networks, such as Portugal, Greece, Spain and Ireland,
would probably be allowed to delay implementation of the proposals.
But senior Commission officials say even the most reluctant telecoms
operators - such as France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom - now accept that a
final target of full competition should be set, partly because it would be
practically very difficult to stop short at partial liberalisation.
Under the draft plans, the first phase of any new approach would be to
ensure the enforcement of existing directives liberalising certain services.
Only later would member states have to consider the most controversial
questions, such as whether to open the building of telephone networks to new
companies.

<TEXT>
THE mood among Russian deputies yesterday was uncertain, but most signs
suggested anti-Yeltsin forces will struggle to get the 689 votes in Congress
for the two-thirds majority needed to impeach him.
Mr Nikolai Pavlov, a member of the fiercely anti-Yeltsin bloc, Russian
Unity, said the chances of impeachment were minimal. The US TV network ABC
quoted a Yeltsin opponent saying: 'We only have 600 votes.'
Mr Yeltsin can rely on support from the Radical Democratic and Democratic
Russia blocs, and can be fairly certain that all in the Union of Creative
Forces and absolutely certain that all in Russian Unity will vote against
him.
The Democratic Centre is the group to play for. It includes the left centre
grouping of Mr Victor Sheinis on the one side and the Free Russia faction of
vice-president Alexander Rutskoi on the other. Mr Sheinis generally supports
the president, while General Rutskoi has come out strongly against Mr
Yeltsin's assumption of special powers.
The ingredient which will work for Mr Yeltsin, if impeachment is put to the
vote tomorrow, is fear. Mr Ramazan Abdulatipov, chairman of the Council of
Nationalities, said: 'It's all very well being a hero but the heroism being
shown will be at the expense of the destruction of Russia.' He called for
compromise.
So numerous have been the warnings of civil war that some impressionable and
wavering deputies from provincial constituencies are bound to be affected,
and vote not to punish Mr Yeltsin.
Further, his milder opponents could be swayed by the continuing impression
that he retains popular support. An opinion poll in the strongly pro-Yeltsin
daily Izvestia yesterday showed Mr Yeltsin with a 50 per cent approval
rating against 9 per cent for General Rutskoi. Nearly 60 per cent said Mr
Yeltsin's assumption of special powers was either correct (49 per cent) or
not tough enough (22 per cent).
One view last night was that an impeachment vote might backfire. Mr Vladimir
Varov, an influential radical from St Petersburg, said: 'I don't object at
all if the anti-Yeltsinites get two thirds. It would show up the Congress
for what they are. And it they tried any action against the president I'm
sure the people would put on an equally suitable reaction.'

FT  25 MAR 93 / Inflation falls to 4% in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANNUAL inflation in Spain fell to 4 per cent in February, the best
performance in five years. But it did little to raise hopes for significant
interest rate cuts and triggered only a modest recovery on the Madrid stock
market.
The February consumer price index was static, meaning that Spain's annual
rate of inflation has fallen sharply from 5.4 per cent at the end of 1992.
Some analysts in Madrid yesterday forecast end-of-year inflation at below 4
per cent.
However the Bank of Spain, which the previous day had decided to hold its
benchmark intervention rate at 13 per cent, was holding short-term money
market rates at around 15.5 per cent, with analysts expecting little
movement soon. Most believe the Spanish will wait to see whether a new
French government relaxes monetary policy after the final round of
parliamentary elections this weekend.
The February figure was, nevertheless, lower than expected and the more
remarkable because changes this year to the way the CPI has been calculated
probably overstate comparative inflation. The new calculation gives
high-inflation service industries greater weight than previously.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Press privacy law proposed by Commons committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LAW to protect privacy, allow legal aid for libel actions against the
media and create two watchdog bodies with wide-ranging powers to punish
unreasonable intrusion by the press are recommended in a Commons committee
report published yesterday.
The report, by the national heritage committee, rejected the proposal by Sir
David Calcutt, in a recent report to the government, that a statutory
tribunal be established to deal with complaints against the press.
However, the committee recommended certain types of intrusion be made
criminal and civil offences, and that the government appoint an ombudsman
with statutory authority to supervise the conduct of the media.
The report drew widespread criticism from national newspapers and industry
organisations, which accused the committee of recommending costly and
unnecessary intervention in the affairs of the press.
Sir Frank Rogers, chairman of the Newspaper Publishers Association, called
it 'an extraordinary document - diffuse and even incoherent'. Lord McGregor,
chairman of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), the self-regulatory body
established in 1990, accused the report of 'slovenly procedures'.
The committee says the PCC has been ineffective in enforcing the industry's
code of practice. It calls for a tougher press commission in its place with
the right to impose fines and require compensation.
The proposed body would be backed up by a publicly funded press ombudsman
with statutory powers to impose penalties. The ombudsman would be
accountable to parliament and could refer cases to the High Court.
The committee calls for a privacy act to make electronic bugging and
trespass criminal off-ences. It would be a civil offence to obtain or
publish harmful or embarrassing personal material or photographs, to publish
misleading personal information and persistently intrude into privacy.
The committee recommends that legal aid be available to permit aggrieved
citizens to bring actions under the bill and under defamation laws.
The report says that although public figures cannot expect the same right to
privacy as ordinary citizens, all individuals are entitled to a 'zone of
privacy'. 'Even the Queen and the prime minister must have the right to keep
some aspects of their lives away from the public gaze,' it says.
The committee says the main purpose of its recommendations is to protect
innocent members of the public who face distressful and unwelcome media
attention. It says freedom to report is essential to a free society, but
must be balanced against the damage caused by excessive and thoughtless
invasion of privacy.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Peace talks on Russian leadership break down: Parliament set
to vote on impeachment of Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S political crisis intensified yesterday after the failure of talks
between President Boris Yeltsin and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, speaker of the
conservative-dominated parliament.
The impasse at the end of the 90-minute meeting between the two opponents
leaves the way open for a vote on impeaching the president tomorrow.
Mr Yeltsin's office said after the talks - attended by Mr Valery Zorkin,
chairman of the Constitutional Court - that the parliamentary leadership had
'again rejected the simple and clear solution proposed by the president, to
decide the fate of Russian statehood by a national vote'.
The statement said a debate on impeachment at an emergency session of the
Congress of People's Deputies would 'sharply raise tensions in the country'.
At the same time, however, doubts were expressed on all sides about the
ability of Mr Yeltsin's opponents to raise the two-thirds majority needed
for impeachment.
Several anti-Yeltsin deputies said such a majority was not presently
available, as representatives who could normally be counted on to vote
against the president's decrees and proposals shied from the chaos widely
forecast if he is called upon to step down.
However, Mr Khasbulatov alluded to a measure, added to the constitution in
December, under which the president could be stripped of his powers if he
was deemed to have acted to disband or suspend any legally elected body of
state authority.
The increasingly feverish warnings of national catastrophe and division were
given point last night with a report on the official Tass news service that
Cossacks in southern Russia had declared an independent republic.
Hopes of a compromise in Moscow had risen earlier yesterday with the
publication of Mr Yeltsin's decree setting out the basis of his address to
the people last Saturday, in which he had said he was assuming 'special
powers'. The decree made no mention of these powers.
Further efforts at compromise remain possible. Mr Khasbulatov, informing
parliament last night of the failure of the talks, said he and Mr Yeltsin
had discussed the possibility of a government of national accord.
Robert Thomson in Tokyo and Ralph Atkins in London write: The Japanese
government was confident last night that it had derailed a push for an
emergency summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations to discuss
the crisis in Russia.
On returning from the US and Europe, Mr Hisashi Owada, vice-foreign
minister, told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, that support was
increasing for the Japanese plan to host a ministerial-level meeting next
month and then the G7 summit as scheduled in July.
Mr John Major, UK prime minister, in a telephone conversation with US
president Bill Clinton, re-emphasised that the G7 countries should encourage
economic reform in Russia, particularly by promoting small businesses and
privatisation.
Jurek Martin reports from Washington: Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign
minister, sketched out a plan for closer co-operation between his country
and leading industrialised nations, eventually leading to fully-fledged
Russian membership of the G7. In a Washington speech prior to a White House
session with Mr Clinton, Mr Kozyrev argued that the phased economic
integration of Russia into the G7 'should become an integral part of the
Russian-US co-operation programme.'

FT  25 MAR 93 / Heseltine woos Tory coal rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, RALPH ATKINS and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, will today launch a
campaign to win support for his coal white paper, encouraged by the early
reaction of potential Conservative rebels to the broad outline of his
proposals.
At least two of the 11 Tory MPs who failed to support the government when
its pit closure programme was debated in October appeared to have been
brought into line by reports that a package to save or mothball between 12
and 19 of the 31 threatened pits had been agreed.
But there were still concerns that the government was putting in place what
amounted to a short-term political fix, with some of last year's rebels
continuing to pledge defiance.
A meeting of 12 MPs in the coal group of Tory backbenchers was understood to
have agreed to focus on improving the long-term prospects for coal if, as
expected, the subsidies proposed by the government are limited to two years.
As the coal and electricity industries continued their attempts to agree
core contracts on coal supplies, Mr Heseltine was expected to back down from
his previous insistence that these deals be signed before the white paper is
published.
The moment of truth for Mr Heseltine will come when MPs vote on the package
next week. The government was last night considering rescheduling a
previously announced debate on Maastricht to give it the option of
accommodating the coal proposals next Monday.
The white paper - to be called 'The Prospects for Coal' - will be published
today and runs to more than 100 pages. It will be accompanied by an
employment training package for the affected regions, worth up to Pounds
100m.
Under the proposals, pits not earmarked for action could be transferred to
the private sector. Others could be transferred to the private sector under
a speeded-up privatisation programme. The government will offer a subsidy
estimated at between Pounds 5 and Pounds 12 per tonne, as well as proposals
for expanding the coal market by curbing imports.
Officials were emphasising that ministers would not decide which pits
survived. Pits scheduled for closure will still be subject to a statutory
review. The six mothballed pits are likely to include at least some of the
four originally earmarked for mothballing, but then reprieved, last October.
There was scepticism among British Coal managers last night about whether
the white paper would lead to many of the apparently reprieved pits staying
open for as long as two years.
The government won last October's vote with a majority of 13, aided by
Ulster Unionist abstentions.

FT  25 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Individual equity moves
dominate senior bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIVIDUAL equities made most of the headlines on senior bourses, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT focused on carmakers. A rise of more than 4 per cent in Volkswagen
brought the sector up with it, Daimler putting on DM11 to DM605.50 during
the official session as the DAX index rose 10.01 to 1,659.45; but in the
afternoon, Daimler gained impetus of its own as plans for a new listing
indicated an extraordinary profit of over DM4bn for 1992, applying
Anglo-Saxon accounting treatment to its hidden reserves. Turnover rose from
DM6bn to DM7bn.
Mr Christopher Will, European automotive analyst at Lehman Brothers, added
his weight to the arguments for VW with a buy recommendation. He
acknowledged that the industry's situation was precarious, with German
vehicle production in February showing a 30 per cent decline compared with a
year earlier.
However, he said, people were beginning to believe that the combination of
Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW's new chief executive, with Mr Ignacio Lopez, just
recruited as production and component purchasing head from General Motors
(he is apparently importing a team with him from Detroit) offered a prospect
of high returns from a company with huge scope for cost cutting.
German sources, late in the day, were inclined to think that the market
could be overestimating the influence of Mr Lopez and that equities in
general could suffer if rumours of an inflation rate of 5 per cent in the
state of Hesse turned out to be accurate.
PARIS saw strong trade in Eurotunnel, with some 3m shares traded early in
the session, mainly by foreign institutions, while LVMH also made gains on
reports of a positive brokers report. The shares made respective gains of 50
centimes to FFr39.50 and FFr102 to FFr3,547.
The CAC-40 index picked up 2.39 to 1,954.57 in turnover of FFr2.8bn.
Carnaud Metalbox, up FFr2 to FFr236, was again heavily traded. A report by
the Paris brokers, Ferri, earlier this week noted that MB-Caradon and CGIP,
which together hold the controlling interest, will sell their stakes jointly
to an unnamed industrial buyer.
Ferri suggested a possible price in the region of up to FFr300 per share,
which could rule out Pechiney International, rumoured to be interested,
which is already burdened by large debt. Other possible buyers include
groups in the US and Germany, the broker added.
MILAN was unsettled by signs that the budget deficit was once again running
off target and shares turned in a mixed performance with the Comit index
ending 1.92 lower at 485.59.
Privatisation stocks were, however, beneficiaries of the deteriorating PSBR
figures on suggestions that the government might accelerate the programme to
raise cash.
Separately, Credito Italiano, the state bank put up for sale last year,
gained L90 to fix at L2,600 but then surged to L2,720 after hours - 8.4 per
cent up on the day - on rumours that a buyer had been found. Deutsche Bank,
at the centre of speculation that it might take a stake, denied that it had
plans to buy.
Montedison fell L68 or 5.5 per cent to L1,163 at its official fixing but
picked up after hours to L1,195 as it denied market rumours that it was
planning a capital increase.
ZURICH marked time ahead of results from Nestle but subsequent profit-taking
left the SMI index 19.5 lower at 2,146.8.
Nestle fell in line with the market, its 9.2 per cent rise in 1992 net
profit proving in line with expectations but a 1-for-25 rights issue, and
plans to swap bearers into registered shares put pressure on the stock. The
bearers fell SFr15 to SFr1,165.
Bearers in Ascom, the telecommunications equipment maker, which said on
Tuesday that 1992 profits would be halved, fell SFr50 to SFr1,390.
MADRID got the better headline inflation rate which the equity market
discounted on Tuesday, but the underlying rate of 5.9 per cent was more or
less in line with expectations and the general index chose to focus on this
as it closed 0.13 lower at 234.48.
Sevillana, the utility, fared likewise. Although the company said that it
would pay an unchanged dividend of Pta43 after a Pta11 cut at the interim
stage, the shares closed Pta5 lower at Pta437 for a yield of very nearly 10
per cent.
BRUSSELS regained some ground late in the session on technical trading, but
the Bel-20 index still closed down 9.41 at 1,246.91 as the market reacted to
the prime minister's resignation and the increase in the emergency lending
rate. Turnover was some BFr1.27bn.
STOCKHOLM saw foreign interest in Ericsson, up SKr5 at SKr247, but the
Affarsvarlden general index slipped 0.7 to 982.3. Turnover was some SKr722m.
OSLO recovered, the all-share index rising 6.18 to 439.38 in NKr375.45m. The
industry index, which includes oil stocks, rose 9.41 to 776.06, Norsk Hydro
adding NKr2.50 to NKr172.
COPENHAGEN was again dominated by activity in Baltica Holding which moved in
a range between DKr103 and DKr60 before closing DKr18.21 lower at DKr76.79.
The KFX index lost 0.15 to 79.05 in turnover of DKr424m. Den Danske Bank,
which has a 32 per cent stake in Baltica, rallied DKr3 to DKr310.

FT  25 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo declines on late
selling by investment trusts
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NIKKEI average gave up early gains to close marginally lower as late
afternoon selling by investment trusts and corporations depressed share
prices, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index average closed down 40.93 at 18,450.69 after a high of 18,643.62
and a low of 18,423.40. It rose in the morning on arbitrage buying, but fell
on position adjustment before the March-end book-closing.
Volume totalled 350m shares against 376m as declines led advances by 570 to
440, with 153 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell by
2.48 to 1,395.43.
Some investors blamed political uncertainty in Russia for their reluctance
to participate in the markets. Traders said the dollar remaining below the
Y116 level against the yen also gave investors an excuse to remain inactive.
Some analysts also noted that the Nikkei's surge in the past two weeks,
accompanied by a sharp rise in trading volume, may not have reflected
genuine investor interest.
One analyst said that the government had pumped in extra public funds to
counter the expiry of margin positions created last September, arbitrage
selling and liquidation of holdings by corporate investors.
A rise in selling and buying levels had activated trading, he said, but
'things would return to normal'.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was heavily traded, rising Y9,000 to
Y810,000. Telecommunications related issues also rebounded on NTT's rise:
Fujikura, the cable maker, gained Y33 to Y678 and Furukawa Electric firmed
Y19 to Y507.
Steels and shipbuilders were lower on profit-taking: Nippon Steel, the day's
most active issue, fell Y3 to Y327, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries lost Y8
to Y550.
High-technology issues were lower on the higher yen with Hitachi falling Y8
to Y752 and Sony losing Y50 to Y4,100. However, Fujitsu gained Y20 to Y605
on buying by US pension funds.
Construction companies lost ground on continuing investigations by
prosecutors of their links with Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former kingmaker of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, currently under detention for alleged
tax evasion. Taisei fell Y16 to Y639 and Obayashi Road lost Y30 to Y1,670.
Speculation that game manufacturers would post firm earnings for the current
year boosted Nintendo, the video game maker, which rose Y20 to Y9,510. Sega
Enterprises was also strong, advancing Y100 to Y10,800.
In Osaka, the OSE average closed down 21.89 to 19,440.50 in volume of 102.1m
shares.
Roundup
HONG KONG and Manila apart, the region's equity markets were not inspired
yesterday. Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Bombay were closed for public holidays.
HONG KONG saw indications of a delay in legislative consideration of the
governor's democratic reform proposals and bullish expectations on the
property front as the Hang Seng index rose 94.24, or 1.5 per cent to
6,212.19.
Turnover rose from HKDollars 2.24bn to HKDollars 2.84bn. Property stocks
rose on hopes that the government will relax its ceiling on banks' mortgage
lending which, developers say, would encourage more buying. The properties
index jumped 207.07, or 2.2 per cent to 9,659.56.
The good corporate results season continued with a 48 per cent jump in
interim profits at New World Development, which rose 40 cents to HKDollars
19.10. Sun Hung Kai Properties rose HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 32.00 ahead
of tomorrow's earnings figures.
MANILA staged a rebound in light volume, the composite index rising 17.05 to
1,460.30 aided by Philippine Long Distance Telephone gains in New York. On
the domestic market, PLDT closed 30 pesos higher at 900 pesos.
AUSTRALIA firmed, but price moves generally were small as investors remained
wary about developments in Russia. The All-Ordinaries index rose 3.6 to
1,663.1 in turnover down from ADollars 276m to ADollars 255m. Tuesday's cut
in interest rates lifted bank shares, with Commonwealth up 12 cents to
ADollars 8.04, National Australia 4 cents to ADollars 8.81 and ANZ 2 cents
better at ADollars 3.48.
NEW ZEALAND echoed Australia's Russia worries, and the NZSE-40 index
finished down 4.62 at 1,553.25, turnover thinning from NZDollars 24.3m to
NZDollars 18.6m.
TAIWAN heard that construction of a sixth, TDollars 200bn naphtha cracker
project is expected to start in early April. Plastics rose and Formosa
Plastics, the biggest investor in what is Taiwan's largest investment
project, put on TDollars 1.60 to TDollars 42.60. The weighted index closed
7.45 higher at 4,654.68.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Repo is unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of German call money fell yesterday after the Bundesbank offered
short-dated funds to German commercial banks at an unchanged rate, writes
James Blitz.
There had been strong speculation on Tuesday night that the Bundesbank would
accept bids for money market funds in its weekly operation at levels well
above established rates, tightening conditions in the cash market.
Many banks had been preparing to bid aggressively for funds so as not to
fall foul of Germany's new minimum reserve requirements at the end of the
month.
As it turned out, the repo rate was unchanged at 8.25 per cent. In part,
this was because the Bundesbank made another generous provision of liquidity
to the tune of DM10.2bn.
Most of the bids were reported to be between 8.25 per cent and 8.27 per
cent, and this also suggested that the Bundesbank encouraged some
participants to bid for funds at the lower end of the range.
The repo allocation eased call money rates, which fell to 8.52 per cent from
8.58 per cent at the start of the day. The June Euromark contract also rose
4 basis points from its opening level, to peak at 92.94, although it later
fell back to close at 92.86.
At this level it is pricing 3-month money in June at 7.14 per cent, some 75
basis points below yesterday's level for 3-month cash.
Sterling markets were very quiet. There were difficulties removing a small
shortage forecast by the Bank of England at Pounds 550m, and this forced the
overnight rate close to 7 per cent towards the end of the day. This may have
been one reason why 3-month money closed slightly firmer at 6 1/8 per cent.
The prospect of another cut in UK base rates is dimming in the medium term,
and some dealers are wondering whether the short-dated sterling yield curve
might now go positive. 'We now have rates flattish at 6 per cent, and there
will be plenty of traders eager to climb aboard the positive curve if it
materialises,' said one dealer yesterday.
Others remain bullish on rate cuts. According to one dealer, a strong
incentive for another cut is that 5-year gilt yields are too low compared to
1-year cash if they are to attract the Pounds 50bn of investment sought by
the government. Five year gilt yields are at 6 3/4 per cent compared to 5
7/8 per cent for cash.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Belgian franc under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BELGIAN franc stabilised inside the European exchange rate mechanism
yesterday after Belgium's central bank raised its official interest rates in
support of the currency, writes James Blitz.
The franc came under pressure inside the ERM after the government was unable
to reach agreement on tax rises which would reduce its budget deficit, and
offered its resignation to the King.
The offer of resignation, which was still being considered last night,
raised concerns in the currency market because a reduction in Belgium's
budget deficit is critical if the country is to meet the convergence
criteria set out by the Maastricht treaty. At the start of trading, the
Belgian currency moved to BFr20.65 against the D-Mark from a previous
BFr20.59.
Although the movement was not great, the central bank has the informal goal
of not allowing its currency to fluctuate by more than 25 basis points
against the D-Mark in the ERM grid. Yesterday morning's fall for the Belgian
franc amounted to a drop of 10 basis points, pushing the franc below the
D-Mark in the grid at one stage.
The Belgian central bank countered the move by raising its emergency lending
rate to 12 per cent from 9.75 per cent, and its central rate by 50 basis
points to 8.50 per cent. By the close of trading, the franc was some 9 basis
points above the D-Mark in the grid, closing at BFr20.62.
Some analysts suggested yesterday that the Belgian franc's problems could
resurface, creating a serious problem for the ERM. Mr Mark Austin, a
treasury economist at Midland Global Markets in London, said that Belgium
might be able to bring its budget deficit within the 3 per cent of GDP, as
set out by the Maastricht treaty. But its government debt, currently at 120
per cent of GDP would have to be halved by 1997, and this would prove
extremely difficult.
However, Mr Mark Brett of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London, said he was
surprised at how easily the franc shrugged off the pressure. 'If the market
was going to have another full-blown crisis, surely this was one of the
issues that would have been grist to the mill,' he said.
The D-Mark closed stronger against several currencies after the Bundesbank
left the rate at which it offers short-term funds to commercial banks
unchanged at 8.25 per cent.
The German currency's strongest performance came against the Italian lira,
closing in London at L978.1 from a previous L969.4. Sterling closed  1/2 a
pfennig weaker against the D-Mark at DM2.4150, but the French franc closed a
touch stronger at FFr3.401 from FFr3.404.
The dollar remained below DM1.63 to the D-Mark for most of the day, despite
strong durable goods figures for February. The US currency closed at
DM1.6285 from a previous DM1.6315.

Platinum was fixed at closed at Dollars 357.25 a troy ounce on the London
bullion market yesterday afternoon, up Dollars 3.25 on the day. Dealers said
the Rustenburg news was continuing to support the market, although it was
being seen more as a powerful signal than anything else. 'The news was good

FT  25 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price provides catalyst for
platinum cuts - Philip Gawith reports on the market pressures being felt by
South African producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TUESDAY'S announcement by Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest producer,
that it is cutting production by closing the Boschfontein shaft contained a
predictable message in a surprise wrapping.
Predictable was the distress signal it conveyed on the part of South African
platinum producers, who account for about 70 per cent of world annual
supply. Declining profits forced both both Rustenburg and Impala, the second
largest producer, to cut their dividends recently and platinum group metal
prices have since trended even lower.
It was perhaps surprising, however, that Rustenburg, the most financially
sound and cost-competitive of the main producers, should have moved first.
If Rustenburg is feeling the strain, then the pressure must be more severe
at Impala and Lonhro, the other large producers. Whereas Rustenburg has cash
reserves of about R550m (Pounds 80m), Impala and Lonhro (in the form of
Western Platinum and Eastern Platinum) have debts respectively of about
R320m and R800m.
Rustenburg's announcement was the second piece of bullish news the market
had received this week. Earlier Almaz-juvelirexport, the Russian export
agency for platinum group metals, had said it would be reducing shipments
this year.
Impala is not planning, at this stage, to follow Rustenburg's lead. Mr
Michael McMahon, executive chairman, said yesterday that 'while current
prices are a matter of serious concern, Impala is not about to follow the
Rustenburg example'. His company 'sympathised entirely' with the pressures
that had caused Rustenburg to act, noting that Impala had already faced
tough decisions in the past with the closure of Messina and Barplats.
Lonrho is not thought to be contemplating a production cut.
Rustenburg's cut can be assessed on several levels. Most obviously, as Mr
Barry Davison, managing director, has made clear, it will benefit
shareholders because a loss-making shaft will be closed and cheaper metal
purchased in the market to cover supply commitments. Also, the closure of
Boschfontein fulfils the strategic aim of the JCI group - which also
controls the Lebowa and PPRust platinum mines - to move further down the
cost curve as expensive production at Rustenburg will be replaced with much
cheaper production at PPRust when it comes on stream later this year.
Most important, however, is the message sent to the market. Although Mr
Davison describes the production cut as a 'statement of fact' rather than an
attempt to move the price, he will clearly be hoping that it helps to
restore equilibrium to a market he has described as being gripped by a
'recessionary psychosis'. Certainly the message from the market leader that
it is cheaper to buy metal in the market than to produce it is a powerful
one.
Both Rustenburg and Impala agree that a significant improvement in platinum
group prices depends not so much on any actions they take as on a recovery
in confidence in the metal. This, in turn, awaits the upturn in demand that
should accompany a world economic recovery. Neither is sanguine about the
short term outlook. Mr McMahon comments: 'I think the glory days for
platinum are some time away'.
That said, both producers are keen to stress that the underlying
supply/demand fundamentals for platinum group metals are quite sound.
'I really have no problem in selling every ounce we can produce,' says Mr
Davison. Both companies have sold all their production and the trend, if
anything, is for customers to ask for more metal, not to seek to reduce
contractual commitments.
Although optimistic about the medium and long term outlook for the metal,
both Rustenburg and Impala are quick to refute suggestions that, like South
Africa's gold industry of yesteryear, they are incorrigible bulls, unwilling
to take hard decisions and close unviable shafts.
Mr McMahon comments: 'Our view on current prices is that we will not just
'vasbyt' (hold tight), plough on regardless because better days lie ahead.
We will manage our operations so that they survive at current prices'. He
says that Impala does not have any shafts that are not covering cash costs,
though some 'aren't contributing the full whack to replacement capital'.
Rustenburg's announcement makes clear that it is not willing to produce
metal at a loss.
While the industry's current difficulties should not be underestimated they
need to be kept in perspective. It is 12 years since weak markets last
forced a cut in production by Rustenburg. But evidence of tough times in the
industry has been around for some time already. This has been most obvious
from action taken in the Impala stable where expansion plans have been
drastically curtailed over the past two years, and the labour force has been
cut by 17 per cent while maintaining existing production levels.
On the other hand, the platinum producers are still a far cry from the
position facing marginal gold producers. Using rough figures Mr Dave
Russell, analyst at stockbrokers Irish &amp; Menell Rosenberg, says a typical
platinum producer on Merensky reef is enjoying revenues of about R200 a
tonne at present prices, compared with cash costs of R110 to R120 a tonne -
still a comfortable margin.
Mr Russell does not expect a similar round of cuts to those in the early
1980s, when production fell by 15-20 per cent. He supports the producers in
their view that though the price may be weak, the market is not. A further
factor, stressed by Mr McMahon, is that there is no point in tinkering: if
cuts do not extend to fixed costs, they are not worth making as revenue will
decline without a commensurate fall in costs, leaving the financial
situation worse than before. Having already cut deeply, Impala is clearly
confident it has achieved the optimum fighting weight for prevailing market
conditions.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lead losses grow as prices slip
to 6 1/2 -year lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT ONE lead producer in the world was making a profit at present market
prices, said Mr Stephen Briggs, analyst at the Metals &amp; Minerals Research
Services consultancy group, after the metal fell on the London Metal
Exchange yesterday to its lowest level for 6 1/2 years.
In real terms, the price of lead had never been so low, he suggested. MMRS
estimated that the average cost of producing refined lead was 23 or 24 cents
a lb compared with yesterday's price of about 18 cents.
The lead market's problems, like those of many other metals, stem from a
surge in exports from the former eastern bloc countries, particularly from
Russia. These countries traditionally were net importers of lead. Statistics
from the International Lead and Zinc Study Group indicate that net eastern
bloc exports last year reached about 130,000 tonnes, more than double the
63,000 tonnes in 1991.
'Historically the lead market has always been roughly in balance, so this is
a huge surplus for the metal,' Mr Briggs pointed out.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, suggested there would be no let up in eastern
bloc exports this year and 'demand for lead remains uninspiring in all the
metal's major consuming regions.' About 65 per cent of refined lead is used
in batteries and, while the US vehicle market was recovering, European
demand was flat. He expected the 1993 lead supply surplus to remain about
150,000 tonnes.
Both Mr Briggs and Mr MacMillan said they expected some substantial
production cuts before long. But Mr Briggs warned: 'There will be no
substantial price rise until we see a solid, sustained increase in demand'.
Lead is still quoted in sterling on the LME and last night metal for
delivery in three months closed at Pounds 275.50 a tonne, down another
Pounds 2.

FT  25 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although offerings in Australia this week are the lowest of any week so far
this season, prices have continued to ease gradually. The market indicator
up to March 24 was 8 cents lower than at the end of last week, the national
basis being 434 cents. a kg., a new low point for the season. The slide
downwards continued despite continuing heavy withdrawals during or prior to
each sale, as growers attempt to resist lower prices and hope for better
conditions later. All statistical evidence at present makes a forecast of
wool market strength highly tentative.

bauxite growth plan

<TEXT>
INDIA'S PUBLIC Investment Board has cleared a proposal by the
government-owned National Aluminium Company (Nalco) to expand the bauxite
mining capacity from 2.4m tonnes to 4.8m tonnes and alumina refining from
800,000 tonnes to 1.35m tonnes. But it has put on hold the proposed 50 per
cent capacity expansion of Nalco's aluminium smelting to 345,000 tonnes.
The PIB decision has been influenced by two factors. First, domestic demand
for aluminium falls far short of the industry's total production capacity of
610,000 tonnes; and second, Indian power costs are high. India has, however,
an abundant supply of rich bauxite and low manpower cost for producing
alumina.
All the additional production will be earmarked for export.
For the expansion of the mines and alumina refinery at Koraput in Orissa,
Nalco will be using technology from Aluminium Pechiney of France, its
original collaborator.
The big alumina export boost will come in the next four years when three
export oriented refineries of a combined capacity of 2.9m tonnes are
commissioned - all in Orissa, which accounts for 1.5bn tonnes of
metallurgical grade bauxite out of India's total reserve of 2.44bn tonnes.

London robusta COFFEE futures closed higher, with the May contract ending at
Dollars 898 a tonne. Traders had put a Dollars 900 target on May, and the
market got within Dollars 1 of that in late trade. The continuing ICO
council talks on a new international agreement were ignored, although
traders noted that volume would remain relatively light until the meeting
ended. Some store was put on a letter from US President Bill Clinton to his
Colombian counterpart on the coffee pact. But it was the reflection of
chart-inspired buying in New York which really encouraged business in
London. COPPER came under pressure on the LME from disappointed liquidation,
extending three-month metal's decline below Dollars 2,200 a tonne against a
background of reduced concern over Chilean supplies as the possibility of
strike action at Chuquicamata faded. New York raw SUGAR prices were mixed at
midday as the market sought signs of the next move. Traders said the market
continued to be prone to volatile swings after hitting a three-year high of
12.53 cents a lb on Monday.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian gold exploitation plan
shelved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR a tender for Russian companies to exploit the country's largest
hard-rock gold deposit have been put on ice.
The sacking of Mr Yuri Nozhikov, governor of the Irkutsk region, announced
by President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday, means that the State Geology
Committee must now wait for a new administration before renewing its
attempts to organise the tender.
But Ms Louise Moore, representative of Star Technology Systems of Australia,
maintains that a joint stock company her company has formed with Lenzoloto,
a Siberian state-owned gold producer, has exclusive rights to exploit the
deposit.
She says she expects Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, to order
previously secret information on the reserves to be declassified so that
Star can pay the first Dollars 20m instalment of its Dollars 250m investment
in the project. Ms Moore says declassification is a condition set by Star's
banks to release the money raised for the project.
But the State Geology Committee wants to see the partners' business plan
before it grants a licence and before the information about reserves can be
declassified. Star argues that it does not need a licence because documents
were confirmed at local level.
The project, which would be the first to allow foreigners into Russia's
undercapitalised gold industry, has been the subject of a long-running
controversy, with parts of the Russian administration opposed to letting a
small Australian company have access to such a prize without competition.
Lenzoloto and Star maintain, however, that their joint stock company has
already been approved by the State Property Committee and that the state is
not providing Lenzoloto with the support it needs to pay workers and
continue construction work for the development of Sukhoi Log. Star is also
going to develop alluvial gold deposits on the site.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway's oil investment 'set to
peak this year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT IN Norway's offshore oil and gas industry will peak this year at
NKr51bn (Pounds 4.95bn), a 17 per cent increase over 1992, and NKr209bn is
expected to be invested over the next five years, according to a report soon
to be issued by Edinburgh-based oil analyst Wood Mackenzie.
This year, the Norwegian state, through its direct financial interest and
Statoil, the state oil company, will be the major investor, with capital
expenditure of an estimated NKr32bn, or 63 per cent of the total. The report
says the state's financial return will move from a relatively weak position
in the early to mid-1990s . . 'to be generating over NKr40bn per annum,'
late in the decade, 75 per cent greater than combined oil companies' cash
flows. 'There are several companies. . . which will have negative cash flows
until the mid to late 1990s,' the report says.
WoodMac says investments in fields in production peaked in 1986, but
substantial expenditure is expected to be made on several fields, notably
Ekofisk, where some NKr10bn may be spent in the mid-1990s on a major
upgrading of the ageing facilities, where at least one new platform may be
required.
Expenditure only on fields under development will peak this year at about
NKr37.7bn, while expenditure on probable developments is expected to ensure
an annual investment level of NKr25bn in the mid to late 1990s, says
WoodMac.
However, the analyst says that several of Norway's current field development
projects have been characterised by a series of cost over-runs and delays.
Higher costs, estimated at NKr2bn, have arisen on the Sleipner East project
because ofdue to the sinking of the original platform, while increases have
ocurred on the Troll, Draugen, Heidrun and Sleipner West fields because of
design changes.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US boosts timber sales to
Europe
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTS of US hardwood timber to Europe have risen sharply to Dollars 435m,
an increase of 17 per cent. Latest figures released by the US Department of
Commerce show that last year 25 European countries accounted for 45 per cent
of US lumber exports.
Germany leads the European field, buying Dollars 80m worth of sawn timber,
up from Dollars 53m in 1991. There were also increases in the value of
lumber shipped to Italy, up 12 per cent, Belgium, up 8 per cent, the
Netherlands, up 29 per cent, and Spain, up 31 per cent. Total US hardwood
timber export receipts in 1992 amounted to Dollars 1.9bn, compared with
Dollars 400m four years ago. Sawn timber exports accounted for Dollars 974m,
up 13 per cent.
Exports now represent about 10% of all hardwood produced in the US.
Mr Michael Buckley, European director of the American Hardwood Export
Council, said environmental pressures on timber sources elsewhere in the
world were working in favour of the US. It had been able to demonstrate the
existence of strict legislation and controls in harvesting hardwood, coupled
with evidence of a long history of sustained yield management and
regeneration.

FT  25 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries slip after steep rise for
durable goods orders
</HEADLINE>

US TREASURY prices edged lower at the long-end yesterday afternoon. In late
trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  9/16 lower at 104,
yielding 6.807 per cent. At the short end of the yield curve, the two-year
note was off  1/16 to yield 3.891 per cent.
The market received a morning jolt when durable goods for February were
reported rising 2.2 per cent. Economists had predicted a more moderate gain
of 0.6 per cent. But the unexpectedly sharp increase largely reflected a
rise in orders for transportation equipment, and the market soon regained
its equilibrium. Stripping out a 10.9 per cent rise in transportation
orders, durable goods orders fell 0.7 per cent in the month.
The Dollars 15.25bn two-year note sale in the afternoon was reasonably
successful. The yield of 3.92 per cent was slightly below expected levels of
3.94 per cent.
The Federal Reserve refrained from operating in the open market when Fed
Funds were trading at 2 15/16 per cent, slightly below the Fed's perceived
target of 3 per cent for the rate. The lack of intervention was widely
expected and did not indicate a change in monetary policy.
EUROPEAN government bond markets generally ended lower on the day as various
political and currency concerns hit the Belgian, Italian and Spanish
markets.
Belgian government bond prices were marked down sharply at the opening by
dealers, following the government's offer to resign on Tuesday night over
its budget crisis.
Short-term interest rates rose as the central bank increased its key rates
to protect the Belgian currency. The spread of Belgian bonds over Germany
increased from around 72 basis points to 85 basis points yesterday.
GERMAN government bonds ended little changed on the day as rumours of a high
inflation figure for one of the key German states helped wipe out earlier
gains.
Dealers said the market showed little reaction to the Bundesbank's repo
yesterday as the lowest rate at which it offered securities repurchase funds
was unchanged at 8.25 per cent.
The Bundesbank accepted bids for DM65.4bn at this week's tender for 14-day
securities repurchase funds, representing a net injection of DM10.2bn, and
allocating funds mostly at 8.25 to 8.27 per cent.
Bund prices declined on rumours that the state of Hesse would this week
report a higher-than-expected inflation figure, dampening hopes of a further
easing in interest rates by the Bundesbank.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 95.22, rising to a high of 95.41
before falling back to 95.28 by the end of the day.
THE UK government bond market witnessed further declines among the very
long-dated stocks as investors switched into shorter-dated issues.
Gilt-edged issues with maturities of up to 20 years generally ended the day
firmer with the five- and 10-year stocks gaining  1/32 - 1/16 .
At the long end of the market, the 7 3/4 per cent stock due 2012/15 fell
15/32 to end at 94 1/4 , with dealers pointing out that investors were keen
to switch to higher-yielding issues.
JAPANESE government bonds ended mixed, with cash bonds slightly higher on
the day, while the June futures contract closed lower.
The yield on the benchmark No 145 issue moved from its opening of 4.07 per
cent, corresponding to the low price of the day, and closed at 4.06 per
cent. The futures contract opened at 109.89 and ended the day at 109.80,
with the decline attributed to heavy selling by dealers.
THE City of London saw a net fall in the number of foreign securities houses
in 1992 for the first time in more than 30 years.
According to a survey by Noel Alexander, the banking consultancy, 22 foreign
securities houses left London last year, while 18 houses set up offices in
the City. The number of foreign houses present fell from 169 to 165 last
year. Noel Alexander attributed the decline to the international downturn in
the securities business and global recession.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Continental buyers warm to UK insurer's
Pounds 120m convertible
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LEGAL and General, the UK life and general insurance group, was one of
several borrowers to tap the Eurosterling sector of the international bond
market yesterday, and its Pounds 120m convertible Eurobond issue due 2008
was well received by the market.
Tax changes to the treatment of share dividends announced in last week's UK
Budget were expected at the time to add to the attraction of convertible
bonds, particularly to UK pension funds, which are adversely affected by the
changes. However, although there was said to be some switching by UK
investors out of Legal and General's equity and into the bonds, most of the
paper was eventually sold to continental European buyers.
Demand for convertible paper, especially from continental Europe, enabled
the issuer to achieve a 6 3/4 per cent semi-annual coupon, at the lower end
of the indicated range, and a conversion premium of 17.85 per cent, at the
higher end of the indicated range. The subordinated issue, callable after
five years, represents 4 per cent of Legal and General's share capital.
An official at the lead manager, CSFB, said that about 80 per cent of the
issue had been placed on the continent, with Swiss investors showing the
strongest interest. The bonds, which were priced at par at issue, were
trading at 100 1/4 bid in the afternoon. Other syndicate managers involved
in the deal reported some demand from UK pension funds.
Mr Anthony Hobson, the finance director of Legal and General, said that the
issue was a fixed tranche and that it would not be increased. The proceeds
would become part of the group's general resources and would serve to extend
the maturity profile of its debt. He added that the group did not have any
plans to tap the international bond market again this year.
The Bank of Dutch Municipalities, the public-sector Dutch financing agency,
launched Pounds 150m worth of seven-year Eurobonds priced to yield 30 basis
points over the 9 per cent UK government bond due 2000. An official at the
lead manager, BZW, said that this marked the first Eurosterling issue by a
Dutch state-owned entity.
He added that the bonds were re-offered below par, at 98.567, in order to
ensure liquidity in the bonds in the event of a further fall in interest
rates. The proceeds of the issue were said to have been swapped into
fixed-rate guilders. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread was
virtually unchanged.
The Eurosterling sector also saw a Pounds 104.5m two-tranche issue of senior
mortgage-backed floating rate notes from Leo 1, a vehicle set up to
securitise mortgages originated by UCB Group, a subsidiary of Compagnie
Bancaire of France. An official at the lead manager, J P Morgan, said this
added to an original issue of Pounds 158m in May 1992.
He added that the original issue had been priced at a slight discount to par
but that the price of those notes had risen since then due to the lack of
paper. Both tranches of yesterday's issue were priced at a slight premium to
par, and were bid at their launch level in the afternoon.
J P Morgan was also active in the Canadian dollar sector where it arranged a
CDollars 300m 10-year Eurobond issue for the European Investment Bank. The
bonds were priced to yield 30 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent Canadian
government bond due 2003. The bonds were not freed to trade by the close of
business.
Meanwhile, investor demand for the warrants linked to Roche Holdings's
Dollars 1bn seven-year warrant Eurobond issue, launched on Monday, enabled
the borrower to raise an additional Dollars 200m through the issue of a
further 5m warrants.
An official at the lead manager, Swiss Bank Corporation, said the new
tranche doubled the number of warrants in issue. The warrants, which are
exercisable into Roche Genussscheine (non-voting profit-sharing
certificates), were quoted at SFr67.80 bid yesterday, up from SFr65.30 bid
at the launch.
Colombia's mines and energy minister, Mr Guido Nule Amin, said yesterday
that the state oil company, Ecopetrol, planned to issue Eurobonds for the
first time to finance its operations, Reuter reports from Bogota.
He did not disclose the size or the timing of the issue. Colombia is the
only big Latin American economy not to have yet tapped the Eurobond market,
but it is planning a sovereign issue in April.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Jardine Matheson rises 17% as HK
performs strongly

<TEXT>
JARDINE Matheson, one of Hong Kong's oldest trading conglomerates, yesterday
reported a 17 per cent increase in net profits to USDollars 316.8m for the
1992 fiscal year, up from Dollars 270.8m in 1991.
The Hong Kong operations performed strongly, particularly in car sales and
financial services, but group earnings were pulled down by the performance
of its Japanese businesses.
Earnings from north-east Asia fell to Dollars 25.1m from Dollars 61.5m, as a
result of falling sales of wines and spirits in Japan and the impact of the
depressed Tokyo stock market on Jardine Fleming, the group's 50 per cent
owned investment concern.
Jardine was recently the target of a denunciation by China, which claimed
the former opium trading company was a 'bad element in Hong Kong's business
community'.
Mr Nigel Rich, managing director, said Jardine Matheson would continue to
expand its businesses both in Hong Kong and China, pointing out that the
'group has traded in China for more than 50 years, and has been through
difficult times before'. Jardine Matheson is planning to expand its
retailing and distribution businesses across the border, but so far the
contribution from China is minimal.
Net profits were lifted by a Dollars 21.6m fall in tax as a result of
previous over-provisioning. Pre-tax profits from Jardine Pacific, which
includes the group's trading, distribution and construction businesses,
increased by Dollars 31m to Dollars 228.7m, helped by a 156 per cent jump in
profits from motor trading subsidiary Jardine International Motors.
Jardine Fleming's earnings were hit by a sharp fall in profits from
UK-listed Jardine Insurance Brokers. Jardine Strategic, the 52 per cent
owned investment holding company which controls Dairy Farm, Hong Kong Land
and Mandarin Oriental, contributed Dollars 367.1m, up from Dollars 333.8m in
1991.
Jardine Matheson will pay a final dividend of 15 cents, making a full-year
payout of 18.7 cents, up 14 per cent from 1991.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: China's regulators face an
unenviable task - Tony Walker and Deirdre Nickerson look at Beijing's
attempts to impose market order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and DEIRDRE NICKERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S unruly and virtually unregulated stock markets must present an
alarming picture when viewed from Beijing, where the heavy hand of
officialdom is perhaps most visible.
Indeed, a member of the leadership was quoted recently in an official
publication as describing China's stock markets in the southern economic
region of Shenzen and in Shanghai as among the world's most risky. He warned
that unless stock market fever was restrained it would 'doubtlessly impose
an increasingly negative impact on the country's economic reform and
economic development'.
Foreign lawyers, bankers and representatives of international institutions
such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have been urging the
promulgation of a new securities law and regulations governing the
operations of the stock markets.
Mr Jerome Cohen, an authority on the Chinese legal system, said that while
such regulations were indispensable to the creation of a successful capital
market, of even more importance was the ability of supervisory bodies to
transform 'legislative language into living reality'.
This, he observed, would not be an easy task, and would require greatly
strengthened legal institutions, including not only the courts, the
procuracy and legal profession, but also relevant government supervisory
agencies.
In contrast, attitudes among Chinese officials, charged with advising the
central authorities on a new securities law and other regulations, seem, in
some cases, remarkably insouciant about the dangers of a South Sea Bubble
crash in China's fledgling markets.
Trading volume in A shares, for local Chinese, and B shares denominated in
US dollars, for foreigners on the Shanghai and Shenzen exchanges, exceeded
Yn100bn (Dollars 17.2bn), last year, compared with just Yn10bn in 1991. This
is extraordinary growth by any standards: 50 companies were listed at the
end of the year, against 15 at the beginning.
Last October,the State Council, or cabinet, announced the establishment of a
Securities Policy Committee (SPC), involving representatives of 14 entities,
including the People's Bank, China's central bank, and a Securities
Regulatory Commission (SRC) to advise on securities-related matters.
These bodies were charged with strengthening macro-control of the markets.
But doubts persist as to the likely effectiveness of the national SRC, given
difficulties of co-ordination among the multitude of bureaucratic
institutions involved in the regulatory process and certain resistance from
increasingly independent regional authorities.
The SPC and SRC have been advising a special securities law drafting
committee which recently circulated a 131-article proposed law, covering the
gamut of equity securities issues from insider trading to the operations of
futures markets and the establishment of securities companies and investment
funds.
Among criticisms of the draft is that while it includes penal provisions, it
is weak on arrangements for enforcement - a responsibility of the SRC. The
law is restricted to equities. It is unclear when national regulations
dealing with debt securities might emerge.
SRC officials say that stock exchange regulations should be published within
a few months and the securities law by later this year. However, the pattern
has been for all Chinese commercial laws and regulations to encounter
repeated delays as various elements of the sprawling bureaucracy chew over
the details.
One of the SRC's most important tasks will be creating regulations,
including rules of disclosure, for initial public offerings. These
regulations will apply to Chinese companies seeking a stock market listing
outside China. This is an especially vexed issue in the Chinese leadership
at present because of the Bermuda-registered Brilliance, a Chinese-foreign
joint venture, which was floated on the New York stock exchange last October
 -the first such example of a Chinese company listing offshore.
Mr Zhu Rongji, China's vice-premier in charge of the economy, has decreed
that in future any new listings must receive his approval and be restricted,
for the time being, to the Hong Kong exchange.
Some Chinese companies, including Shanghai Petrochemical and Qingdao
Brewery, are working towards Hong Kong listings. But foreign lawyers and
accountants familiar with these cases say they are proving inordinately
complex because of difficulties in valuing assets, establishing the full
extent of liabilities and any one of a dozen or more requirements for the
issuing of prospectuses to comply with international standards.
Another of the SRC's responsibilities will be to regulate over-the-counter
(OTC) trading under the Securities Automatic Quotation System, a
nationally-based computer-linked arrangement, that is some way yet from
being up-and-running. In the meantime, OTC trading is a fast-spreading
phenomenon throughout China with the coastal city of Tianjin a particular
focus.
Control of this form of 'off-the-board' equities trading may well provide
the SRC with some of its biggest headaches.
OTC trading, which was designed as a means of state companies rewarding
employees with bonuses in the form of stock, has spiralled to the point
where business transacted in Tianjin, some of it in the street where
marketmakers scrawl prices on blackboards, is believed to have exceeded
trading on the Shenzen and Shanghai exchanges combined.
The estimated figure for shares traded on the OTC or secondary market for
China was in the order of Yn170bn but this almost certainly understates the
volume.
Not surprisingly, given the speculative frenzy that prevails in a China
starved for so long of real investment opportunities, the clamour from
regional capitals for their own stock markets has been almost deafening.
China's leaders have rejected these demands, and proposed instead that
provinces should select a maximum of three local companies for listing on
the Shenzen and Shanghai exchanges.
China's securities regulators facing the fairly unenviable task of trying to
impose order and encourage responsible self-regulation, are certain to have
been reminded of the dictum of supreme Chinese leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping.
'Cross the river by feeling the stones,' he once observed.
The problems for the SRC and its associate organisations is that the river
is flowing swiftly and the stones on the bottom are by no means secure.

NATIONAL Mutual Life Association of Australasia is to restructure its
Australasian insurance operations to cut costs and improve service, Reuter
reports from Melbourne.
National Mutual, Australia's second-largest life office, said it would
reduce duplication, provide a flatter management structure, and reduce the
size of the head office.
Mr Geoff Tomlinson, managing director, said the number of redundancies could
not be predicted. The unlisted company cut staff by 10 per cent to 6,600
people in the year to September 30 1992.
Mr Tomlinson said National Mutual aimed to make each of its profit centres
as autonomous as possible and commit each to meeting a reasonable profit
target.
He said Australasian insurance would be split into five profit centres and
four support units.
National Mutual lost ADollars 46.6m (USDollars 31.7m) in 1991-92, the first
year it published audited profit figures.

NEW World Development, the Hong property development and hotels group

net profit to HKDollars 1.39bn (USDollars 181m) for the six months to
December 1992, up from HKDollars 939m in the previous year.
The bulk of earnings growth came from property sales, which contributed
HKDollars 951m to operating profit, up from HKDollars 645m in 1991. Rental
income showed a slight decline, due to the sale of several floors of the
Convention and Exhibition Centre, in Wanchai. However, average occupancy
stood at 95 per cent.
The company declared an interim dividend of 25 cents per share, up from 21
cents in 1991.

<TEXT>
FOODCORP, the food processing subsidiary of Gencor's manufacturing arm,
Malbak, overcame difficult trading conditions to post real earnings growth
in the six months to the end of February.
Foodcorp, one of three leading food groups in South Africa, was formed last
April when Malbak reorganised its food interests by merging Fedfood and
Kanhym.
Comparing Foodcorp's results with the combined Fedfood-Kanhym performance in
the same period last year, turnover rose by 8 per cent to R1.3bn (Dollars
406m) from R1.21bn. Lower finance costs offset a decline in operating
income, so pre-tax profits were unchanged at R72m. A lower tax bill helped
lift attributable profits to R46m from R40m.
Earnings per share rose by 14 per cent to 95 cents from 83 cents, but the
dividend was cut to 23 cents from 32.4 cents per share in line with a new
policy that dividends should in future be paid on a 40:60 interim to final
ratio.
Mr Dirk Jacobs, chief executive, said the first half had been characterised
by weak consumer demand resulting in lower volumes and tighter margins as
selling prices could not be increased to compensate for higher input costs.
Rationalisation benefits and productivity improvements had allowed margins
to be maintained.
Mr Jacobs said the market for the group's products was likely to remain
depressed for the rest of the year.
However, he forecast that the rate of earnings growth achieved in the first
half would be maintained for the full year.

<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, the US credit rating agency, has downgraded its rating on
American Express, the travel and financial services group.
The American Express Credit Corporation was downgraded from AA- to A-Plus
and commercial paper from A-1-Plus to A-1 and preferred stock from A-Plus to
A.
S&amp;P said the downgrades reflected lower profitability at the core
travel-related services (TRS) division and the company's continuing card
member attrition rate. TRS, according to S&amp;P, faced increasing competitive
pressure, which is expected to continue to affect net earnings.
S&amp;P also pointed to the group's plan to sell a large shareholding in its
First Data Corporation subsidiary as one way of offsetting write-offs, such
as a Dollars 342m charge last year related to the restructuring of the TRS
division.
The First Data offer began yesterday. But S&amp;P noted 'there may be fewer such
non-recurring gains available in the future to offset unforeseen
weaknesses.'
American Express said the ratings changes would have 'an insignificant
impact' on its funding costs.
Last year, losses at Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment banking and
brokerage subsidiary, helped cause a 65.4 per cent slump in fourth-quarter
1992 net income at American Express, to Dollars 82m.
American Express agreed earlier this month to sell the Shearson brokerage
business to Primerica, the financial services group headed by Mr Sandy
Weill.
S&amp;P yesterday affirmed its A-rating of Shearson's senior debt.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Grim scenario for Credit
Lyonnais - Heavy provisions could push bank into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANALYSTS are bracing themselves for gloomy figures next Monday when Credit
Lyonnais, one of Europe's biggest banks and France's most prominent
state-controlled companies, publishes its 1992 results.
Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, Credit Lyonnais' controversial chairman, has warned
that 1992 was the group's worst year for two decades. Given that it suffered
a loss of FFr177m in 1974, the bank may have fallen back into the red last
year.
Credit Lyonnais barely broke even in the first half of last year after
provisions of FFr6.3bn (Dollars 1.1bn), and Mr Haberer has warned that
provisions will be even higher in the second half.
This grim scenario could not have come at a worse time. First, it could
jeopardise Credit Lyonnais' hopes of being privatised. It also poses a
threat to Mr Haberer, who was appointed by the socialists in 1988 and risks
losing his job if, as expected, the right wins power.
Mr Haberer has pursued an aggressive policy in terms of loans and
international expansion in his five years at Credit Lyonnais.
As a result, it has been much more vulnerable than its fellow French banks
to the economic slowdown. Credit Lyonnais is not only heavily exposed to the
weakest areas of the French economy - small companies and commercial
property - but also to a string of corporate catastrophes, including Dollars
215m to Robert Maxwell's media empire and Dollars 350m to the Olympia &amp; York
property group.
The most tortuous saga has been its involvement with the bid by Mr Giancarlo
Parretti, the controversial Italian financier, for MGM, the Hollywood movie
studio. Credit Lyonnais has been left with a stricken film business, a
string of lawsuits and persistent speculation that its final exposure will
be higher than its official estimate of Dollars 900m.
These 'big hits' have been largely responsible for the steep increase in
Credit Lyonnais' provisions. The average level of provisions as a percentage
of average loans has trebled in the past three years, to 1.6 per cent on an
annualised basis for the first half of 1992, against an average of 1 per
cent for the other big three French commercial banks.
Some aspects of Mr Haberer's strategy have worked, however. Credit Lyonnais'
French banking network is still robust, mainly because of prudent
cost-cutting. Its international expansion has also been successful,
particularly in Spain and Italy. The group continued its growth last year by
taking control of BfG Bank in Germany.
'There is no cause for concern on the domestic front,' says Mr Chris Davis,
European banking analyst at BZW Securities. 'Credit Lyonnais has held its
own in a difficult market. It has also done well with its European network.'
The critical question is how much longer will Credit Lyonnais' results be
clouded by write-offs on its loan portfolio? The answer is complicated by
its refusal to release details about provisions, or even to specify whether
it has finished writing down its exposure to 'big hits'.
'It is very difficult to tell what is going on,' says Ms Sheila Garrard,
banking analyst at Shearson Lehmann in London. 'But the French economy is
still weak and it will take time for small businesses and commercial
property to recover. We're likely to have more high provisions in 1993.'
In theory, Credit Lyonnais, alongside Banque Nationale de Paris, the other
big state-controlled bank, should be one of the first candidates for
privatisation by the new government. But the conservatives, were forced to
postpone plans to float the bank in their last administration after the 1987
stock market crash, and will undoubtedly have to delay the sale.
'Credit Lyonnais is not sellable in the near-term,' says Ms Susan
Sternglass, European banking analyst at Goldman Sachs. 'It will have to wait
until it can show that its loan book is in good shape and that it has real
prospects for profits recovery. That could happen in 1994 if there are no
more major corporate losses.'
The other big issue is whether the conservatives will allow Mr Haberer to
lead Credit Lyonnais into the private sector. The arrival of a new
administration is traditionally followed by the weeding out of old
appointees.
Mr Haberer is undoubtedly vulnerable. He is seen as a socialist sympathiser,
although he worked for conservative ministers in the 1960s and 1970s.
Moreover, if the new government ousts him, Credit Lyonnais' 1992 results
will probably provide a suitable excuse.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Gerstner emerges as a leading
candidate for top job at IBM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR LOUIS Gerstner, chairman of RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco company,
has emerged as a leading candidate for the top job at International Business
Machines amid rising speculation that IBM could shortly name a new chief
executive officer.
RJR Nabisco declined to comment on reports of Mr Gerstner's impending
departure yesterday. IBM also declined to comment on reports that have been
circulating that Mr Gerstner has had several meetings with IBM's selection
committee of non-executive directors.
The committee was formed in January when Mr John Akers, IBM chairman and
chief executive, said he would step aside from the chief executive post
following IBM's announcement of Dollars 4.9bn losses for 1992, the company's
second consecutive annual loss.
As soon as IBM makes a final selection and reaches contractual agreements
with a candidate, it will, under US securities laws, be required to make an
immediate announcement. The lack of such an announcement suggests no final
decision has been made.
Other potential candidates, including Mr John Sculley of Apple Computer, Mr
Larry Bossidy of Allied-Signal and Mr George Fisher of Motorola, have issued
statements saying they would not take the job.
The selection of Mr Gerstner would suggest that IBM's board has decided the
company needs stronger financial controls rather than new technology
leadership, since Mr Gerstner has no experience in the computer industry.
He was named as chief executive of RJR Nabisco in March 1989, shortly after
the record Dollars 25bn leveraged buyout of the food and tobacco giant.
Then 47, he moved to the company from American Express, which he had joined
in 1978 as president of the card division, and risen to become chairman of
the executive committee of the parent company in 1983, and then president in
1985.
Although Mr Gerstner has no direct prior ties to IBM, his brother, Mr
Richard Gerstner, isa former IBM senior executive. He retired recently for
health reasons.
Mr Richard Gerstner was succeeded in his last post at IBM as head of the
computer company's personal systems division by Mr James Cannavino. Mr
Cannavino is now seen as a likely choice for president of IBM , succeeding
Mr Jack Kuehler.

PERNOD-RICARD, one of France's leading drinks groups, increased net profits
by 15 per cent to FFr1.13bn (Dollars 204m) last year from FFr983m in 1991.
Mr Patrick Ricard, chairman and chief executive, said that 'despite the
unfavourable economic environment and the decline in consumption' the group
had continued to show growth chiefly due to its international expansion
strategy.
The group saw turnover fall by 4.8 per cent from FFr15.22bn in 1991 to
FFr14.5bn in 1992. This decline in sales was due to disposals, notably the
sale last May of the bulk of the Societe des Vins de France wine business.
Mr Ricard said the underlying rate of sales growth was 4.7 per cent.
Pernod saw operating profits fall from FFr2.05bn in 1991 to FFr1.98m mainly
because of disposals. However, it compensated with an increase in
exceptional gains from FFr16m to FFr264m over the same period. The board has
raised the dividend by 6 per cent to FFr8.5 for 1992.
The company, like other French concerns, was affected by the franc's
strength following the September currency crisis. It estimated that exchange
rate changes reduced sales by FFr291m and operating profits by FFr32m.
Last year was the first that Pernod received more income from its
international operations than from its French business.
It continued its international growth last year by opening new subsidiaries
in Taiwan and South Korea and setting up joint ventures in Poland and
Hungary.
Pernod is also expanding its domestic activities, notably by securing the
distribution contract for Pepsi-Cola in France.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Six colleagues follow Lopez to
VW

<TEXT>
SIX EUROPEAN colleagues of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the Spanish
purchasing chief who quit General Motors last week to join Volkswagen, have
also resigned from GM to join him at the German car manufacturer.
Three of them were among 20 GM purchasing executives in charge of buying
parts and materials around the world, while the three others were more
junior buyers. The German company refused to confirm that the men would join
the company.
Mr Lopez was appointed last week as head of production and purchasing at VW.
He was estimated to have cut Dollars 1bn or more of purchasing costs from
GM's lossmaking North American operations since his appointment as head of
the worldwide purchasing in May of last year.
Analysts regarded his departure as a considerable blow to GM's North
American cost-cutting programme, since he brought a idiosyncratic flair to
the job, but they did not think the loss of his six colleagues would have
much additional impact on GM.
GM itself said the resignations of the six would have 'little consequence'
for its programme.
Four of the six worked for GM in Detroit and followed Mr Lopez there from
Europe. They are Mr Jose Gutierrez, who was in charge of buying machinery
and equipment; Mr Hugo Van der Auwera, in charge of buying metals, who only
moved to the US in January; Mr Francisco Garcia, the executive responsible
for purchasing bought electrical parts; and Mr Andre Versteeg, a more junior
buyer. The two other buyers worked for GM in Europe and were named as R.
Piazza and J. Alvarez.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Skanska plunges to SKr3.53bn
deficit

<TEXT>
SKANSKA, Scandinavia's largest construction and property company, plunged to
a SKr3.53bn (Dollars 457m) loss after financial items in 1992, due to huge
property write-downs, high interest rates, and the impact of foreign
currency speculation.
The worse-than-expected result, which compares with a SKr738m profit in
1991, led the company to cut its dividend to SKr1.50 per share from SKr3.25.
The two main reasons for the deficit were SKr4.3bn in property write-downs
and one-off financial losses of SKr1.4bn. However, weaker market conditions
for the group's main activities led to an 8 per cent slump in revenues to
SKr31.9bn and to a 21 per cent fall in operating income to SKr2.47bn from
SKr3.12bn.
The property write-downs, which compare with SKr1.15bn in 1991, were much
bigger than envisaged at the eight-month stage, when the group said they
would total SKr1.5 to SKr2bn. They reflect lower real estate values, both in
Sweden and abroad.
Write-downs on the value of the group's Swedish real estate book totalled
SKr1.9bn, while properties in London and Oslo were written down by more than
SKr1.5bn. A further SKr800m in write-downs related to other foreign
properties.
The group suffered an extraordinary SKr518m loss due to foreign currency
deals which resulted in the dismissal of the head of its finance subsidiary,
Skanska Kapitalforvaltning, last August.
However, because the portfolio was financed by short-term borrowing, the
group incurred heavy financing costs when Swedish overnight interest rates
shot up to 500 per cent last September. Realised losses in the portfolio,
which has now been discontinued, plus financing costs totalled SKr872m.

BANCA COMMERCIALE Italiana, the state-controlled Italian bank which is to be
privatised, suffered its second consecutive year of sharply-falling net
profits with a 16.9 per cent drop to L263.8bn (Dollars 167m) in 1992.
The reduction in earnings at parent bank level followed a 33 per cent slump
in 1991, However, the dividend again remains unchanged at L200 for ordinary
shares and L230 for savings stock.
BCI attributed its lower earnings to higher taxes and depreciation,
write-offs on securities and heavier provisioning for loan losses. Similar
factors are likely to push down earnings at most Italian banks this year.
Earnings at operating level showed an opposite tendency, with a 21.2 per
cent jump in gross profits to L1,380bn, due partly to careful cost control
matched by a slight decrease in staff numbers.
Continuing heavy investments in new branches, which increased the network by
60 units to 706 at the end of last year, contributed to a 10.9 per cent rise
in deposits to L92,736bn. Loans rose by 13.3 per cent to L85,339bn. At group
level, total assets last year went up to L131,000bn from L117,053bn in 1991.
Monte Dei Paschi di Siena, the Italian bank, is set to take majority control
of Sindibank, the small Spanish financial institution in which it bought a
minority holding in 1990.
Sindibank, controlled by the Fierro group, has 40 branches and is currently
stock market-listed. Monte dei Paschi plans to raise its stake to 57 per
cent from the current 33 per cent via a capital increase now under way. That
will be followed by a public tender offer for the remaining shares left
floating, after which Sindibank will be delisted.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Esselte to cut dividend despite
return to black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ESSELTE, the Swedish office products group, has reported a SKr259m (Dollars
33m) profit after financial items for 1992, after the demerger of a
lossmaking unit and rationalisation measures helped it turn round a 1991
loss of SKr416m.
Despite this, the group is cutting its dividend to SKr2.50 per share from
SKr5.25 because it says cash-flow has deteriorated and the market outlook is
uncertain.
Group profit would have been SKr124m higher in 1992 without the impact of
currency losses caused by the depreciation of the krona. These, together
with a worsening of market conditions towards the end of the year, prevented
the group from meeting its June forecast of a SKr400m profit.
Turnover fell to SKr9.91bn from SKr15.6bn, partly because of the recession
but mainly because of the demerger of the company's Scandinavian-based
distribution business which now operates under the name of Scribona. These
activities contributed to the 1991 loss as did SKr416m in non-recurring
costs caused by restructuring.
The group's main unit, Esselte Dymo, which markets office products in
Europe, Australia and the Far East, saw sales fall to SKr3.69bn from
SKr4.01bn.

VEBA, the German industrial conglomerate, confirmed yesterday it would
maintain its dividend at DM12 a share despite pre-tax profits dropping by 20
per cent to DM2.342bn (Dollars 1.435bn) in the year to December 31.
Net profits, after goodwill write-downs, fell by 14.7 per cent to DM1.043bn,
down from DM1.222bn the year before. Net income after minority interest
stood at DM906m, down from DM1.095bn in 1991.
'The current drop in earnings is not strong enough to lower our dividend. We
are prepared to follow a smooth rather than strict correlation between
earnings and the dividend,' the company said.
Group sales for 1992 rose by 9.9 per cent to DM65.4bn. Two-thirds of the
increase reflects the acquisition of the forwarding company, Schenker.
Production costs rose by 11.2 per cent.
Earnings per share for the group went down by 9.7 cent to DM26.20 in 1992,
down from DM29 the year before.
The drop in earnings per share does not include the restructuring costs of
DM109m in the chemical divisions and DM246m in the power generating
business.

ARGENTARIA, the state-owned Spanish banking corporation, yesterday said that
60 per cent of the shares in the group which are to be privatised will be
sold to domestic buyers.
Mr Francisco Luzon, the group's chairman, said this tranche would come from
a total of between 15 and 25 per cent of the capital to be sold off.
No details on pricing were given, but the offering could raise up to
Pta150bn (Dollars 1.29bn).
Argentaria's consolidated book value on December 31 1991 was Pta528bn, and
its current market capitalisation is conservatively estimated at Pta600bn.
Mr Luzon said Spanish retail investors would receive preferential treatment
in the offering and be able to acquire Argentaria shares for a minimum
outlay of Pta25,000 (Dollars 215) and a maximum one of Pta8m.
He said he would like to place 20 per cent of the banking group but would
raise the offering to 25 per cent, the maximum authorised by the government,
if domestic demand proved strong enough. 'I want 200,000 shareholders,' he
said.
The weighting towards the retail domestic market follows the pattern
established by the state-controlled energy group Repsol.

HEAVY CLAIMS from foreign and credit insurance business kept Finnish insurer
Pohjola in the red for the third consecutive year in 1992, although its
operating loss narrowed to FM525m (Dollars 89m) from FM588m in 1991, writes
Christopher Brown-Humes.
The company relied on an improved investment performance, where income rose
to FM508m from FM379m, to help offset a deeper underwriting loss of FM307m,
compared with FM190m. Premiums fell 5 per cent to FM3.24bn, following a 4
per cent decline in domestic premiums to FM2.84bn, and a 12 per cent drop in
foreign premiums to FM407m.

FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Nestle climbs 9.2% and announces
rights issue

NESTLE, the world's largest foods group, yesterday revealed
better-than-expected profits for 1992. The group also proposed a dividend
rise, announced a rights issue, and set out a plan for simplifying its share
structure.
Consolidated net profit rose 9.2 per cent last year to SFr2.7bn (Dollars
1.8bn), or SFr73 per share. The directors, describing the performance as
satisfactory, are proposing that the dividend be increased from SFr21.50 per
share to SFr23.50, and from SFr43 to SFr47 per participation certificate.
Meanwhile, the group, which also became the world's largest supplier of
mineral waters following its SFr3.4bn acquisition of Source Perrier last
summer, announced plans for a light rights issue. The terms would be
disclosed later.
The group said it would be 'at below market price' at the rate of one for
every 25 registered or bearer shares and two for every 25 participation
certificates.
They directors are also proposing to convert the participation certificates
into bearer shares at the rate of two shares for each certificate, and then
to convert all bearer shares into registered shares at a rate of one for
one. The aim was to simplify the capital structure and increase the market
liquidity of Nestle shares.
'The board is convinced this measure will render Nestle shares even more
attractive to institutional investors,' the company said in a statement.
Owners of bearer shares and participation certificates could remain
anonymous by not registering their holdings. In that case, however, they
could not vote their holdings.
The 9.2 per cent growth in net profit for the year was, as forecast,
substantially below the 16.5 per cent rate achieved in the first half, but
it was higher than some recent analysts' estimates.
Sales were up 8 per cent to SFr54.5bn and the group said volume grew 3.3 per
cent. 'This increase, which is neither influenced by currencies nor by
acquisitions, is all the more satisfactory since it was obtained in spite of
economic downturns in many regions of the world,' Nestle said.
Trading profit gained 10.8 per cent to SFr5.6bn, indicating a margin
improvement for the third year in a row.

FT  25 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wimpey deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was no great surprise at the placing of the majority of the Grove
Charity Management stake in George Wimpey, the housebuilder and contractor.
The charity's stake has long been viewed by some of the more aggressive
securities houses as ripe for placing. Yesterday SG Warburg Securities and
Cazenove, Wimpey's broker, jointly disposed of a 29 per cent block of Wimpey
shares, via bought deal, leaving the charity with a 5.5 per cent stake in
the building company.
Warburg and Cazenove bought the stake of some 84.3m shares at 131p and
placed them with institutions at 132 1/2 p a share. The two firms shared a
Pounds 1.2m profit in the process.
Wimpey shares settled 4 lower at 142p. Turnover reached 206m shares.
BT was among the five most-actively traded stocks in the market, the shares
closing 13 higher at 420p on turnover of 10.7m. NatWest Securities was an
aggressive buyer of the stock, anticipating a positive news flow as the sale
of the government's remaining 21.8 per cent stake looms up in the summer.
The broker said 'with a good experience in BT 2, and a high savings ratio,
the retail market is likely to be attracted to a substantial part of the
offer, keeping institutions underweight and aiding the BT price.'
NatWest also said it is not convinced that BT is the only potential buyer of
EDS, the US computer services group, a move which hasd acted as a BT share
price negative. NatWest forecast BT will grow its earnings per share by an
average 20 per cent in the next two years, against a UK market average of 16
per cent and the dividend by 10 per cent, against the market's 6.5 per cent.
Continued fears of increased competition in the domestic beer market hurt
Whitbread, off 6 at 470p.
Favourable comment on its purchase of the Sutcliffe catering group on
Tuesday lifted Granada, up 6 at 391p. Thorn-EMI weathered a UBS Phillips and
Drew downgrade, the broker bringing its forecast down to the more median of
market forecasts. The shares lifted 12.5p to 877.5p.
A share squeeze, following an upbeat analysts visit to engineering group
VSEL, saw the shares move sharply ahead by 60 to 645p. Mr Clive
Forrestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said: 'Despite the recent
difficulties in the defence market, the company has both strong profits and
cash generation prospects.'
Worries about the accountancy practices at both TI Group, and Siebe, hit the
shares of the only two engineering companies represented in the FT-SE 100.
The former shed 3 to 302p, while the latter gave up 11 to 449p.
Nervous trading in Vickers saw the shares surrender 5 to 120p, ahead of next
week's closing date for the company's Pounds 60.5m rights issue.
Among motor stocks, the market continued to take a negative view on BBA
Group which announced a Pounds 125.9m rights issue on Tuesday and the shares
eased 4 to 166p. Yesterday it was the turn of components group BSG
International to join the rights issue trail as it declared an improvement
in full year profits. The shares retreated 8 to 69p. The market was cheered
by the bumper profits and acquisition by Lex Service from Lucas Industries.
Lex jumped 16 to 335p, while Lucas closed a penny off at 138p. Conglomerate
Trafalgar House, hardened 1 1/2 to 77p, after reporting an 89 per cent take
up of its rights issue. It is expected that the outstanding shares will be
taken up by Hongkong Land.
Results from Kingfisher caused few surpises, the headline figures having
been indicated at the time of the Darty deal, the French electrical retailer
bought last month. However, fresh news on B&amp;Q, Kingfisher's DIY arm, did
provide some lift to the shares and subsequently depressed other home
improvement groups, Boots and WH Smith. Sales at B&amp;Q in December and January
were said to be up 16 per cent, with the subsidiary embarking on a new
aggressive sales drive for Easter. In contrast, Boots and Smiths have had to
make provisions in their most recent figures for the loss-making subsidiary,
Do It All.
Kingfisher shares, aided also by an upbeat post-results meeting, put on 3 to
544p in turnover of 2.4m. Boots slipped 10 to 508p in volume of 2.5m.
Dealers attributed the fall in Unilever to cautious comments from Swiss food
group Nestle on the outlook for the European food business with its results
announcement yesterday. The shares shed 10 to 1190p. BZW were said to be
keen on Cadbury-Schweppes, up 8 at 490p. Nomura and Smith New Court were
positive on Northern Foods, ahead 5 at 277p.

A positive round of presentations, together with technical corrections,
benefited Carlton Communications, shares in the media group jumping 27 to
748p. Turnover was a good 3.1m. UBS Phillips and Drew were said to be
positive, arguing that fears of new technology hitting its video duplication
business had been overdone. The broker also emphasised Carlton's product arm
where sales of the Qantel video component system are thought strong.
Goldman Sachs also lifted its profit forecast after seeing the company,
moving up Pounds 5m to Pounds 128m this year, and by Pounds 3m to Pounds
155m for 1993. However, media specialists also pointed out that the stock
had fallen back in recent weeks and was due a recovery.

FT  25 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The savaging of the final dividend and extent of the write-offs at Lasmo,
the oil exploration and production group, shocked the stock market,
triggering the biggest-ever single day's trade in the shares and a hefty 10
per cent decline in the stock price.
The market had braced itself to expect bad trading news and a possible
reduction in the dividend. But most oil analysts expressed surprise with the
size of the dividend cut and the write-offs. 'Looking at the numbers and
attending the post-results meeting was a numbing experience,' said one
specialist. He said that 'if a potential predator decided to launch a bid
for Lasmo it would, certainly in the short term, encounter very little
opposition among institutions which are now extremely disillusioned.'
Another analyst, adopting a slightly more generous view, spoke of the
analogy with BP, in that Lasmo had 'thrown all the bad news in and that from
now on things could only get better.' However, Mr John Toalster, one of the
oil sector's most aggressive bears, said of Lasmo: 'It's now revealing the
extent to which it has been disaster prone; overstating the oil price;
overstating reserves; overvaluing assets; overpaying on dividends and
underestimating costs; sell the shares down to 145p.' At the close Lasmo
were 19 down at 173p with turnover reaching a record 22.5m shares.

FT  25 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: US gloom hits drug sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROFITS warning issued overnight by Merck, the world's largest
pharmaceuticals group, the third such warning by US drug companies in the
past week, brought an abrupt halt to the one-day rally in the UK drug
sector.
Drug shares in London rose strongly on Tuesday as institutions took the view
that recent heavy selling of stocks such as Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham,
triggered by fears of a drugs price freeze in the US as well a series of
damaging individual company stories, had been overdone.
But yesterday's news from Merck was seen by UK market specialists as
indicating fundamental problems with the drugs industry in the US. 'This
really is bad news, Merck is the star performer in the world drugs
business,' said one international analyst. Merck said first half earnings
would be 'badly affected' by competition in the US, by healthcare measures
expected there soon and by foreign currency pressures.
Glaxo, buffeted in recent weeks by a series of worrying developments,
including the resignation of Mr Ernest Mario, the former chief executive,
and criticism of its claims for its Zantac anti-ulcer drug, dropped 17 to
597p, on heavy turnover of 7.8m shares. Newspaper reports of a much cheaper
antibiotics ulcer treatment also affected the shares. SmithKline Beecham
fell 12 1/2 to 416p with 3.7m shares traded. Wellcome, scheduled to report
interim figures this morning, closed 20 lower at 890p.

FT  25 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MID-SESSION bargain hunting helped bring about a recovery in stock index
futures after an initial decline in an otherwise featureless derivatives
sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE 100 started trading at 2,869 and was driven
lower on lack of demand and sporadic selling, mainly from independent
traders. It had fallen to the day's low of 2,855 by mid-morning.
That level appeared to provide some resistance and after a further bout of
sideways trading, bargain hunters helped bring about a recovery in the June
contract. The buying was encouraged by the firm performance in the fixed
interest markets. The session's high of 2,879, was reached just before the
official close.
The June contract,however, came off the top to finish at 2,873, 3 ahead of
Tuesday's close and at a slight discount to the underlying cash market. In
contrast the volume in the June contract was light reaching only 7,510 lots
by the close.
In traded options, turnover improved to reach 33,366 contracts with a
sizeable part of the total due to the March expiry in some of the stock
options. The FT-SE 100 option traded 4,621 lots and the Euro FT-SE 100
option was also busy at 2,228.
In the stock options Sears was the most active, with most of the day's
business said to have been closing March positions.

FT  25 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hold steady in hefty
turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER large corporate share placing, in the form of a bought deal in the
construction and building sector, was comfortably taken yesterday by a UK
stock market also tested by a batch of less than favourable trading reports
from leading British companies. Equities were held back for most of the
session by hints of impending US selling of British Petroleum and of the
pharmaceutical stocks. But early dealings on Wall Street saw the Dow 10
points higher, and share prices steadied in London to show very little
change on the session.
Trading volume remained high but this reflected a combination of tax-related
dealing and activity in selected heavyweight blue chip stocks. Dealers
maintained that any selling prompted by the Budget measures on Advance
Corporation Tax has been completed. SmithKline Beecham yesterday joined the
growing list of UK companies to increase dividend payment because of tax
measures in the Budget.
The day's Seaq total of 833.5m shares was also swollen by a placing of a 29
per cent stake in George Wimpey, the housing and construction group, by way
of a bought deal in the market. The deal was regarded as a further sign that
there is a ready market among institutions for large lines of good class
stocks at close to current market levels. Retail, or customer, business in
equities, which had shown signs of flagging, recovered on Tuesday to record
a value total of 1.35bn.
Equities were unsettled in early deals when Lasmo, the North Sea energy
group, announced a savage cut in its dividend payment, apparently taking by
surprise recent buyers of the shares. There was little encouragement from
the rest of the day's list of corporate trading statements. Figures from
Kingfisher, the UK high street retailer, had been largely disclosed at the
time of the announcement of the planned merger with Darty of France.
At the final reading, the FT-SE Index was a mere 0.5 off at 2,860. The fall
of just over 2 per cent since the Budget is much in line with expectations,
especially in view of the absence of a base rate cut. Strongly expressed
rejections of hopes for another early cut in base rates by Mr Norman Lamont,
the UK chancellor of the exchequer, have been taken to heart in the equity
market. Further progress by equities is expected to depend upon a flow of
convincing indications that the domestic economy is on the road to recovery.
Strategists said that there was a 'much better feeling' in the stock market
this week as share prices appeared unaffected by the Budget changes in
dividends on overseas earnings of UK companies, by successful placings of
blocks of shares and the evident success of the recent rights issues which
had overshadowed sentiment previously. Yesterday it was announcedthat the
rights from Trafalgar House had received 89 per cent take-up.
However, there was some nervousness in the pharmaceutical sector following a
further bearish statement from one of the leading names in the US industry.
The heavily-weighted drug stocks, which feature in virtually all investment
fund portfolios, have shown a somewhat mixed performance since the rest of
the London market began to rise in mid-September, when sterling quit the ERM
network.

FT  25 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow lower as Merck issues
profits warning

Wall Street
US EQUITIES gave up slim early gains to move lower yesterday afternoon
following a renewed sell-off in drug stocks on news that Merck, the
pharmaceuticals group, planned to cut jobs because of a slowdown in earnings
growth, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
Market volatility was reflected by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which
closed at 3,445.38, down 16.48. It rose more than 10 points in morning
trading before program-selling had its affect, sending the index down more
than 31 points in afternoon trading.
The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 was down 0.62 at 448.14, while
the Nasdaq composite eased 0.68 at 674.36.
Trading volume on the NYSE was more than 274m shares and declines had a
slight edge on rises, by 997 to 884.
On Tuesday, the Dow had slipped 3.62 to 3,461.86.
Merck plunged Dollars 2 1/4 to a 52-week low of Dollars 34 3/4 in very heavy
trading, but recovered from its low of the day. The company's announcement
that its profits growth would start slowing in the first quarter of this
year was released after the market had closed on Tuesday.
The news prompted analysts to reduce earnings forecasts for a number of
pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Schering-Plough, which lost
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 57 5/8 and Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 56 1/2
respectively.
Other actively-traded drugs stocks included Glaxo Holdings, down Dollars
3/8 at a year-low of Dollars 17 5/8 , Bristol-Myers Squibb, off Dollars  1/4
at Dollars 57 7/8 and Abbott Laboratories, Dollars 7/8 lower at Dollars 23
7/8 .
Some cyclical and oil stocks held their own in morning trading, helping to
limit the impact of the drug sector selling. International Paper held steady
at Dollars 65 1/2 and Exxon firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 65 1/8 .
In the motor industry sector, Ford Motor eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52
1/4 , General Motors fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 38 7/8 and Chrysler slipped
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 38 3/4 .
Ford reported improved mid-March sales for US cars and trucks, but General
Motors saw US car sales slide in the same period, although its truck sales
showed strong gains.
Carnival Cruise Lines plummeted Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 33 1/4 after
posting disappointing first quarter net income. Although earnings in the
three months rose to 36 cents a share from 33 cents, analysts had expected a
stronger performance.
IBM tumbled Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 51 1/8 amid intensifying concern abut
the mainframe computer industry after Amdahl forecast a bleak first quarter
reflecting erratic product demand and intense price competition.
Pessimism about the outlook for healthcare companies leached into the Nasdaq
market, where shares in biotechnology companies lost ground including Amgen,
down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 34 3/4 and Chiron, off Dollars 1 7/8 at
Dollars 47 5/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended little changed in active trading. According to
preliminary figures, the TSE-300 index rose 4.97 points, or 0.14 per cent,
to close at 3,603.70. Advancing issues led declines 366 to 319.
Volume of 61.55m included two blocks in Royal Bank of Canada totalling
almost 3 m shares, and a block of about 1.3m Canadian Imperial Bank shares.

FT  25 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Bundesbank rates cut lights the fuse -
Michael Morgan looks at European equity turnover in February
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank's move to cut interest rates early in February, and the
confidence this engendered for further cuts in Germany and elsewhere,
provided the key for a sharp rise in trading volume in most of the European
bourses during the month.
'Rising volumes reflect strong markets,' says Mr James Cornish of NatWest
Securities, noting that the FT-A Europe index recorded a 5.1 per cent rise
in January, as investors pinned their hopes on lower rates.
Germany was by far the largest beneficiary of the Bundesbank's rate cut on
February 4 and the welcome given to the move by investors was reflected in a
46 per cent rise in bourse turnover for the month, compared with January.
This also represented a 50.6 per cent increase on the average for November
to January and the highest level since January, 1992.
'After a period of fairly level volumes from the beginning of the year, they
began to pick up in the second week of February and have remained at these
high levels until the last few days as concern has grown over developments
in Russia,' says Mr Cornish.
Across Europe, month-on-month turnover rose by 15.3 per cent in February
after the 12.5 per cent increase registered during January.
Paris, initially churlish on the grounds that the Bundesbank had done no
more than it had to, turned its attention to financial stocks and the market
remained in a state of high expectation throughout February that there could
be more good news on rates.
This took Paris turnover up 20.0 per cent to the highest level since last
September.
The Netherlands began the month in a gloomy mood with Daf filing for
protection from creditors and doubts over Fokker's sale to Deutsche
Aerospace. However, the overall mood was not soured and turnover rose by
15.1 per cent to the highest level since August 1990, 29.9 per cent up on
the average of the previous three months.
Italy demonstrated its independence with a rates cut of its own, only hours
before the German reduction. But it also suffered traumas with the ever
widening political corruption scandals. But strong demand for blue chips
spurred an 11.5 per cent rise in trading on the month.
Spain edged just 1.8 per cent higher; the market's underperformance
reflected disappointment at upward pressures on interest rates. The lack of
international interest in the market was demonstrated by a 7.7 per cent
decline in volume on SEAQ International, the London screen-based system for
international stocks.
Switzerland fell 21.1 per cent to more normal levels after January's steep
rise, but February was still 12.3 per cent higher than the average of the
previous three months.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Clark recommends Berisford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE over the future of C&amp;J Clark will now be fought by shareholders
as the company, riven by a boardroom row for several months, yesterday
announced it had chosen Berisford to be the recommended bidder for the shoe
manufacturer owned by the Clark family since 1825.
A main factor in the decision to recommend Berisford, the agribusiness and
property group, appears to have been price. Berisford is thought to have
offered marginally more than Pounds 2 a share, valuing Clark at between
Pounds 157m and Pounds 160m.
Mr Alan Bowkett, Berisford's chairman, said he was delighted to have won the
board's approval to proceed to the next stage of negotiations. 'I am
convinced this represents a marvellous opportunity for both companies to
grow internationally', he said.
Clark will inform shareholders of the formal offer in about two weeks, when
it announces its annual results. It is likely to call an extraordinary
meeting before the annual meeting - now planned for the end of April - to
put the proposals to shareholders.
The sale is expected to be the subject of heated dispute among Clark's 500
family members who control 70 per cent of the group. At least four members
of the 11-strong board - who claim to control more than 30 per cent of the
shares - strenuously object to the loss of family control.
However, a sale has been on the cards since shareholders agreed to find the
best price for the company following a bid approach backed by Electra
Investment Trust.

FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: GPG seeks agreements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS Peat Group, New Zealand entrepreneur Sir Ron Brierley's UK
investment arm, was last night seeking agreements with Kredietbank
Luxembourgeoise to allow it to make an agreed bid for Brown Shipley
Holdings, the investment and broking business.
GPG said it would proceed with a full cash bid of 35p, valuing BSH at Pounds
5.6m, if agreements 'with the relevant parties' were reached by 5.30pm
today. (It originally said it was considering a bid on March 17, contesting
an earlier 30p bid by KBL which had already been recommended by the BSH
board.
KBL's bid was made after it emerged that it had potential claims on BSH of
Pounds 2.4m. These arose from indemnities given to KBL when it bought Brown
Shipley and Co, BSH's banking arm, last year.
GPG said it was satisfied with all the information it had received, as
demanded last week, on BSH. A full bid was now conditional on the settlement
and release of all claims KBL had against BSH, and the continued provision
of computer facilities to BSH by KBL.

Vizcaya Holdings, the USM-quoted mining and exploration group, incurred a
reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.46m for the year to end-December.

struck after an exceptional write-down of Pounds 1.38m against the group's
concession in the non-operational Coto Chomin mine. The previous year saw an
exceptional debit of Pounds 3.41m.
Losses at the operating level amounted to Pounds 80,611 (Pounds 171,093).
Losses per share worked through at 2.68p (6.7p).
Mr Desmond Bloom, chairman, said the group intended to reorganise and focus
its activities on property investment.
